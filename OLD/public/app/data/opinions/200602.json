This appeal arises out of a\n\ncreditor's quest to block a debtor's discharge in bankruptcy.   The\n\nbankruptcy court declined to default or sanction the debtor for\n\nclaiming her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination,\n\ndetermined that she had not transgressed the strictures of 11\n\nU.S.C. § 727(a), and   granted the discharge.   The district court\n\naffirmed these rulings, and the debtor now appeals.\n\n          We agree with the creditor that there are suspicious\n\ncircumstances here.    As an appellate court, however, we are not\n\nfree to second-guess the management of pretrial discovery, weigh\n\nthe evidence afresh, or make independent judgments about the\n\ncredibility of witnesses.   Instead, our function is to examine the\n\nrecord with care, defer to the properly supported factual findings\n\nof the court of first instance, determine the applicable law, and\n\nensure that the trier properly applied it to the facts as found.\n\nHaving performed these tasks, we conclude, as did the district\n\ncourt, that the decision of the bankruptcy court is impervious to\n\nthe creditor's attack. Consequently, we affirm the judgment below.\n\n                                 I.\n\n                            Background\n\n          The underlying bankruptcy proceeding has been pending\n\nsince 1995.   We do not here attempt to rehearse the entire history\n\nof the case, but, rather, offer a synopsis of the facts designed to\n\ngive needed context to the issues on appeal.\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f            Joan E. Carp (the debtor) and her husband, Stephen Carp,\n\nfiled a joint petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in February\n\n1995.   See 11 U.S.C. §§ 701-784.       Among the affected creditors was\n\nthe appellant, Richard W. Gannett. Gannett filed a timely proof of\n\nclaim for $82,093.85, plus interest and costs, arising out of the\n\nrendition of legal services.\n\n            Several months later, Gannett commenced an adversary\n\nproceeding,    objecting    to   the    Carps'    proposed     discharge   in\n\nbankruptcy.    He relied on 11 U.S.C. § 727(a)(2) and (4), arguing\n\nthat the Carps had willfully failed to disclose their ownership\n\ninterests in a number of assets, including a parcel of real\n\nproperty located at 824 Dedham Street, Newton, Massachusetts (the\n\nNewton property) and three automobiles.          With regard to the Newton\n\nproperty   Gannett   asserted    that    the   Carps   owned   an   equitable\n\ninterest in it even though legal title reposed in one Mordechay\n\nPupkin.    Gannett further asserted that the Carps were using Pupkin\n\nas a straw in order to defraud creditors; that they had funded\n\nPupkin's mortgage payments; and that any semblance of rental\n\npayments was a sham.       With respect to the cars, Gannett alleged\n\nthat the Carps had attempted to defraud their creditors by giving\n\ntheir children legal title to the automobiles.           He argued that it\n\nwas absurd to think that the children owned three vehicles while\n\nthe parents themselves owned none.         The Carps denied the material\n\nallegations of Gannett's complaint.\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f            To say that matters did not proceed smoothly would be a\n\ngross   understatement.    Gannett   served   deposition   notices   and\n\ninterrogatories in October 1995 and added a request for production\n\nof documents in January of the following year.        On February 29,\n\n1996, he moved to compel, pointing out that the Carps had not\n\nreplied to these discovery requests.    The bankruptcy court granted\n\nthe motion.    When the Carps still did not cooperate, Gannett moved\n\nfor the entry of a default judgment.   The Carps responded that they\n\nwould not submit to discovery because they were the targets of a\n\ncriminal investigation for bankruptcy fraud being conducted by the\n\nUnited States Department of Justice.\n\n            On May 16, 1996, the bankruptcy court again ordered the\n\nCarps to provide discovery. The court also imposed a $750 monetary\n\nsanction and continued Gannett's motion for entry of a default\n\njudgment.     On August 22, 1996, the bankruptcy court denied that\n\nmotion.\n\n            Meanwhile, the criminal investigation went forward.       On\n\nOctober 14, 1996, the government filed a criminal information\n\nagainst Stephen Carp, charging him with one count of bankruptcy\n\nfraud, 18 U.S.C. § 152, related to his alleged failure to disclose\n\nan equitable ownership interest in the Newton property.       On April\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f27, 1997, Stephen Carp pled guilty to this charge.           The district\n\ncourt sentenced him the next day.1\n\n             The bankruptcy court had wisely continued the case until\n\nthe outcome of the criminal prosecution was finally determined. In\n\nthe interim, the court maintained careful watch, holding no fewer\n\nthan five status conferences from the fall of 1996 through the\n\nspring of 1997.     From time to time, Gannett mentioned that he was\n\nstill awaiting discovery materials but no action was taken.              At a\n\nstatus conference held on April 24, 1997, Gannett again raised the\n\nissue, and the debtor acknowledged that she had not yet complied\n\nwith the discovery orders because of her asserted Fifth Amendment\n\nprivilege.     The court stated that there was no point in attempting\n\nto press forward with discovery if the debtor was going to plead\n\nthe Fifth Amendment and directed the parties to file a joint status\n\nreport following Stephen Carp's sentencing.\n\n             Once   the   criminal   prosecution    had   ended2   and    the\n\nadversary proceeding against Stephen Carp had been resolved, see\n\nsupra note 1, the bankruptcy court set a trial date for the\n\nadversary proceeding against the debtor.           Prior to the scheduled\n\n\n\n     1\n      Following Stephen Carp's admission of guilt, Gannett moved\nfor summary judgment against him in the pending adversary\nproceeding.   See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7056.   The bankruptcy court\ngranted this motion and denied Stephen Carp a discharge. Because\nStephen Carp's case is closed, we treat Joan Carp as the sole\ndebtor.\n     2\n         The debtor was never criminally charged.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fstart of trial, the trustee in bankruptcy moved to consolidate that\n\nproceeding with an adversary proceeding that he (the trustee) had\n\nbrought against Pupkin. The court consolidated the two actions and\n\nvacated the scheduled trial date.             The trustee eventually settled\n\nwith Pupkin, thus undoing the consolidation.\n\n            The next bump in this long and winding road occurred in\n\nApril of 2001 when the bankruptcy court scheduled an evidentiary\n\nhearing on the debtor's discharge for October 3 of that year.\n\nGannett dawdled for several months and then, on August 23, filed a\n\nrenewed    motion   for   entry    of    a    default       judgment       or,    in    the\n\nalternative, for additional time to conduct discovery.                                 At a\n\nhearing held on September 24, the court denied both prayers on\n\ncondition that the debtor submit to a deposition prior to trial and\n\nproduce the previously requested documents before the deposition.\n\nThe debtor delivered the designated documents and appeared for a\n\ndeposition on October 1.          Although she did not assert her Fifth\n\nAmendment privilege, she nonetheless refused to answer certain\n\nquestions pursuant to her counsel's instructions.\n\n            Gannett made no further complaint about inadequate or\n\nuntimely    discovery,    and     the    bankruptcy          court       conducted      the\n\npreviously   scheduled     bench    trial          on    October    3.      The   debtor\n\ntestified    without      asserting          any        privilege    against         self-\n\nincrimination.      In an ore tenus decision, the bankruptcy court\n\nfound the debtor credible and concluded that there was insufficient\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fproof   that    she   had    either    knowingly   concealed   property   or\n\nvouchsafed a false oath.        Discerning no basis for the denial of a\n\ndischarge, the court entered judgment accordingly.             The district\n\ncourt affirmed, see Gannett v. Carp (In re Carp), No. 02-10086 (D.\n\nMass. Aug. 30, 2002) (unpublished), and this appeal followed.              We\n\nhave jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 158(d).\n\n                                       II.\n\n                              Standard of Review\n\n            Notwithstanding the fact that we are the second-in-time\n\nreviewers, we cede no special deference to the district court's\n\ndeterminations. Brandt v. Repco Printers & Lithographics, Inc. (In\n\nre Healthco Int'l, Inc.), 132 F.3d 104, 107 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nRather,   our   review      directly   addresses   the   bankruptcy   court's\n\ndecision.   Gronan v. Watman (In re Watman), 301 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n2002). We scrutinize that court's findings of fact for clear error\n\nand its conclusions of law de novo.          Id.\n\n            The application of the Bankruptcy Code to a particular\n\ncase poses a mixed question of law and fact, which this court\n\nreviews for clear error unless the bankruptcy court's analysis was\n\nbased on a mistaken view of the legal principles involved.                See\n\nMiller v. Peterson (In re Indep. Eng'g Co.), 197 F.3d 13, 16 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).     Under the clear error standard, the trier's findings\n\nof fact and the conclusions drawn therefrom ought not to be set\n\naside \"unless, on the whole of the record, we form a strong,\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\funyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\" Cumpiano v. Banco\n\nSantander, 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990).            It follows that if\n\nthe bankruptcy court's findings are supportable on any reasonable\n\nview of the record, we are bound to uphold them.                 See Boroff v.\n\nTully (In re Tully), 818 F.2d 106, 109 (1st Cir. 1987); see also\n\nAnderson v. Beatrice Foods Co., 900 F.2d 388, 392 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(warning that appellate review of \"fact-dominated issues cannot be\n\nallowed to descend to the level of Monday-morning quarterbacking\").\n\n                                     III.\n\n                                 The Merits\n\n          Although     Gannett's        asseverations      are    not   neatly\n\nsegregated, we distill them into two principal lines of argument.\n\nFirst, he challenges the bankruptcy court's decision to allow the\n\ndebtor to testify without penalty after repeatedly having invoked\n\nthe Fifth Amendment to insulate herself from furnishing discovery\n\n— and he couples this challenge with a more general objection to\n\nthe court's    oversight   of    the    discovery   process.       Second,   he\n\ncalumnizes the bankruptcy court for its refusal to block the\n\ndebtor's discharge under 11 U.S.C. § 727(a).            We discuss these two\n\nlines of argument sequentially.\n\n                                       A.\n\n                           The Fifth Amendment\n\n          We   turn   first     to   those   contentions    related     to   the\n\ndebtor's invocation of the Fifth Amendment. We review a bankruptcy\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fcourt's discovery decisions for abuse of discretion — and that\n\ndiscretion is very wide.        Brandt v. Wand Partners, 242 F.3d 6, 18\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).      The fact that the Fifth Amendment is implicated\n\nin Gannett's litany of discovery-related complaints does not serve\n\nto alter this standard of review.              See Gutierrez-Rodriguez v.\n\nCartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 575-77 (1st Cir. 1989); see also Serafino\n\nv. Hasbro, Inc., 82 F.3d 515, 518 (1st Cir. 1996).             Unless we can\n\nfairly say that the bankruptcy court abused this wide discretion,\n\nits management of the pretrial discovery process must be respected.\n\n            As a matter of law, Gannett's claim that the bankruptcy\n\ncourt should    not    have    allowed   the   debtor   to   testify   without\n\nsanction lacks force.         Gannett does not dispute — nor could he —\n\nthat a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding can invoke the Fifth\n\nAmendment.    See, e.g., McCormick v. Banc One Leasing Corp. (In re\n\nMcCormick), 49 F.3d 1524, 1526 (11th Cir. 1995); Martin-Trigona v.\n\nBelford (In re Martin-Trigona), 732 F.2d 170, 175 (2d Cir. 1984).\n\nHe does not allege — nor could he on this record — that the\n\ndebtor's invocation of the privilege was chimerical or otherwise\n\nimproper.    Rather, Gannett's thesis is that pleading the Fifth\n\nAmendment in a civil proceeding should yield consequences, and that\n\nthe condign consequence of the debtor's action should have been\n\npreclusion. In other words, the bankruptcy court ought not to have\n\nallowed the debtor to testify because she did not provide discovery\n\nuntil the eve of trial.\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f           The short answer to this importuning is that Gannett did\n\nnot preserve the issue for appeal. After the documents were finally\n\ntendered and the deposition held, Gannett never complained to the\n\nbankruptcy court that the discovery was either too scanty or too\n\ntardy.   By the same token, he did not question the propriety of the\n\nobjections    interposed   by   the   debtor's   counsel   during   the\n\ndeposition.   To cap matters, far from asserting that the debtor's\n\ntestimony should be precluded by her longstanding invocation of the\n\nFifth Amendment, he himself called the debtor to the witness stand.\n\nIf delayed discovery, once received, is incomplete, inadequate, or\n\ntimed so as to impede effective trial preparation, the aggrieved\n\nparty must object in advance of trial.           The failure to do so\n\nconstitutes a failure to raise the issue at the proper time and in\n\nthe proper setting.    That failure bars the aggrieved party from\n\nraising the issue on appeal.     See Hemingway Trans., Inc. v. Kahn\n\n(In re Hemingway Trans., Inc.), 993 F.2d 915, 935 (1st Cir. 1993);\n\nLaRoche v. Amoskeag Bank (In re LaRoche), 969 F.2d 1299, 1305 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).\n\n           To be sure, Gannett did assert at the September 24\n\nhearing that the debtor should not be permitted to testify at trial\n\nbecause she had persistently invoked the Fifth Amendment.            In\n\nresponse to that assertion, the bankruptcy court ordered that the\n\ndebtor produce documents and submit to an immediate deposition. If\n\nthis was not a satisfactory ameliorative, Gannett was obliged to\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\frenew his complaint following the receipt of the documents and the\n\ntaking of the deposition.    Cf. DesRosiers v. Moran, 949 F.2d 15, 22\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (stating that when a party proceeds with trial\n\nwithout complaining about delayed discovery, the court will not\n\npermit that party to complain after judgment).      He did not do so.\n\n           Gannett's fallback position is that the bankruptcy court\n\nerred by refusing to enter a default judgment against the debtor.\n\nIn the last analysis, however, the decision as to whether discovery\n\nsanctions are warranted and the choice of what sanctions should be\n\nimposed are matters within the sound discretion of the trial\n\ncourt.3   Poulin v. Greer, 18 F.3d 979, 984 (1st Cir. 1994).          The\n\ndisallowance of a discharge — which would have been the effective\n\nresult of a default judgment in this case — is strong medicine.\n\nThere is no basis either in the record or in the law for us to\n\nsecond-guess   the   bankruptcy   court's   discretionary   refusal    to\n\nprescribe so harsh a penalty.\n\n           In a modest variation on this theme, Gannett suggests\n\nthat the bankruptcy court at least should have drawn a negative\n\ninference against the debtor due to her repeated invocation of the\n\nFifth Amendment privilege.    But in a civil proceeding, the drawing\n\n\n\n     3\n      Gannett's claim that the debtor should have been denied a\ndischarge because of her failure to comply with court orders could\nhave been framed as a claim under 11 U.S.C. § 727(a)(6)(A) rather\nthan as an argument that sanctions were wrongly withheld.       But\nGannett never advanced such a claim in the bankruptcy court, and he\ntherefore has forfeited it.\n\n                                  -11-\n\fof a negative inference is a permissible, but not an ineluctable,\n\nconcomitant of a party's invocation of the Fifth Amendment.              See\n\nMulero-Rodríguez v. Ponte, Inc., 98 F.3d 670, 678 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nWhile the law does not forbid adverse inferences against civil\n\nlitigants who refuse to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds, see\n\nBaxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976), it does not mandate\n\nsuch inferences.    When all is said and done, the trial court has\n\ndiscretion over whether a negative inference is an appropriate\n\nresponse to the invocation of the Fifth Amendment in a particular\n\ncivil case.\n\n          The bankruptcy court, in the exercise of this discretion,\n\nchose not to draw such an inference here.          The record evinces no\n\nspecial factors suggesting that this choice was arbitrary or\n\ncapricious,   and   we   are   hesitant   to   overturn   a   trial   court's\n\ndiscretionary decision to afford an extra measure of protection to\n\na litigant's constitutional right against self-incrimination.             Cf.\n\nSerafino, 82 F.3d at 518 (emphasizing that courts must take special\n\npains to ensure that the Fifth Amendment privilege is safeguarded).\n\nThere was no error.4\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Gannett's argument that the burden of persuasion should have\nshifted to the debtor as a result of her invocation of the Fifth\nAmendment is simply a restatement of the argument that the court\nshould have drawn a negative inference against the debtor. Thus,\nwe reject this version of the argument for the reasons discussed\nabove.\n\n                                   -12-\n\f            We give short shrift to Gannett's final discovery-related\n\npoint: that the bankruptcy court failed to balance Gannett's right\n\nto a fair trial against the debtor's Fifth Amendment interests.\n\nOnce again, the specter of a procedural default looms.           Although\n\nGannett did object generally to the bankruptcy court's management\n\nof   the   discovery   process,   he   never   specifically   asserted   an\n\ninfringement of his right to a fair trial.          More importantly, he\n\ndid not make any claim regarding the unfairness of proceeding after\n\nhe had secured discovery.     Thus, the bankruptcy court had neither\n\nthe occasion nor the opportunity to decide whether the discovery\n\nthat Gannett belatedly received was sufficient to cure any prior\n\nharm.      If that discovery — i.e., the document production and\n\ndeposition — had not rectified the situation and restored the\n\nbalance, Gannett had an affirmative obligation to come forward and\n\nrequest further relief from the court.         See Macaulay v. Anas, 321\n\nF.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir. 2003) (holding that \"[a] party who has the\n\nopportunity to ask the trial court for relief but fails to do so\n\nforfeits the right to claim, on appeal, that the relief should have\n\nbeen granted\"); Anderson, 900 F.2d at 397 (similar).\n\n            Even were we to reach the merits of this claim, Gannett's\n\ncause would not prosper.          He relies chiefly upon our Serafino\n\ndecision to undergird the argument that the bankruptcy court failed\n\nadequately to consider his right to a fair trial.                But that\n\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fdecision simply cannot support the weight that Gannett places upon\n\nit.\n\n            It is true that Serafino stands for the proposition that\n\n\"one party's assertion of his constitutional right should not\n\nobliterate another party's right to a fair proceeding.\" 82 F.3d at\n\n518. It is also true, however, that the balancing of these factors\n\nis left largely to the informed discretion of the trial court.             See\n\nid.   The court need not make an elaborate series of written\n\nfindings.    Cf. United States v. LaCruz, 902 F.2d 121, 123-24 & n.1\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (holding that explicit findings as to the probative\n\nworth/prejudicial effect balance under Evidence Rule 403 are not\n\nalways required).        What   counts    is   that   the   court's   implicit\n\nconclusion    —   that    Gannett     would      receive     a   fair    trial\n\nnotwithstanding the delayed discovery — is satisfactorily anchored\n\nin the record.    After all, the bankruptcy court made significant\n\nefforts to ensure that Gannett could gain access, prior to trial,\n\nto the information necessary to prosecute his case.                   Moreover,\n\nGannett never identified what information he coveted that was not\n\navailable from other sources. Under these circumstances, we are at\n\na loss to see how Gannett's rights were unfairly impugned.\n\n                                     B.\n\n                           11 U.S.C. § 727(a)\n\n            Gannett next contends that the bankruptcy court erred on\n\nthe merits in granting the debtor a discharge.              As the objecting\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fparty, Gannett had the burden of proving that the debtor should be\n\ndenied a discharge.          See Commerce Bank & Trust Co. v. Burgess (In\n\nre Burgess), 955 F.2d 134, 136 (1st Cir. 1992), abrogated on other\n\ngrounds by Field v. Mans, 516 U.S. 59, 72-75 (1995).               Although the\n\nultimate decision about whether to grant or withhold a discharge is\n\na mixed question of law and fact, Gannett takes dead aim at the\n\ndistrict court's factual findings.             Accordingly, we \"review only\n\nfor clear error, with 'due regard . . . to the opportunity of the\n\nbankruptcy court to judge the credibility of witnesses.'\"                    In re\n\nBurgess,   955   F.2d    at     137   (quoting     Fed.   R.   Bankr.   P.   8013)\n\n(alteration in original).\n\n           Gannett identifies two statutory bases for denying a\n\ndischarge in this case.         We treat these in the ensemble.          In doing\n\nso, we note that one of the Bankruptcy Code's core purposes is to\n\ngive worthy debtors a fresh start.                 See Jamo v. Katahdin Fed.\n\nCredit Union (In re Jamo), 283 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nThus,   exceptions      to    discharge   should     be   construed     narrowly.\n\nRutanen v. Baylis (In re Baylis), 313 F.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           Gannett's first sortie involves section 727(a)(2) of the\n\nBankruptcy   Code,      which    provides     in   pertinent    part    that   the\n\nbankruptcy court shall withhold a discharge if\n\n           the debtor, with intent to hinder, delay, or\n           defraud a creditor or an officer of the estate\n           . . . has transferred, removed, destroyed,\n           mutilated, or concealed, or has permitted to\n           be transferred, removed, destroyed, mutilated,\n           or concealed — (A) property of the debtor,\n\n                                       -15-\n\f            within one year before the date of the filing\n            of the petition; or (B) property of the\n            estate, after the date of the filing of the\n            petition . . . .\n\n11 U.S.C. § 727(a)(2).\n\n             Gannett's second sortie involves section 727(a)(4) of the\n\nBankruptcy Code, which provides in pertinent part that a discharge\n\nshall not be granted if \"the debtor knowingly and fraudulently, in\n\nor in connection with the case — (A) made a false oath or account.\"\n\nId. § 727(a)(4).         Under that proviso, a discharge can be refused\n\nonly if the false oath \"relat[ed] to a material fact.\"                         In re\n\nTully, 818 F.2d at 110.\n\n            Each of these provisions requires a showing of fraudulent\n\nintent.    See In re Chavin, 150 F.3d 726, 727 (7th Cir. 1998).                  The\n\nbankruptcy    court      found   that   Gannett     had   failed   to   make    this\n\nshowing.   Because the determination of intent depends largely upon\n\nan   assessment     of    the    debtor's    credibility,     respect    for     the\n\nbankruptcy court's factual findings is particularly appropriate in\n\nthis context.       See In re Burgess, 955 F.2d at 137.            Even when the\n\ntotality of the circumstances might plausibly support an inference\n\nof skullduggery, the bankruptcy court's contrary finding must be\n\ncredited unless the evidence is so one-sided as to compel the\n\ninference of fraud.         See Palmacci v. Umpierrez, 121 F.3d 781, 790\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).\n\n            Here,     the   bankruptcy      court   found   the    debtor   to    be\n\ncompletely credible, and Gannett's insinuations certainly do not\n\n                                        -16-\n\fcompel the opposite conclusion.               That seemingly ends the matter.\n\nIn re Burgess, 955 F.2d at 137.             Gannett, however, seeks to capsize\n\nthe   bankruptcy      court's    finding      on   the   ground     that    intent   or\n\nculpability should be imputed to the debtor because her husband\n\nacted fraudulently (a fact that is, at this stage, beyond cavil)\n\nand she was her husband's alter ego or agent.\n\n            We   do    not    reach    the    merits     of   the   first    of   these\n\nsuggestions because Gannett neglected to raise the alter ego theory\n\nbefore the bankruptcy court.               See In re LaRoche, 969 F.2d at 1305\n\n(holding that a failure to advance an issue before the bankruptcy\n\ncourt forfeits the right to raise it on appeal).                    That a party may\n\nnot advance an         argument for the first time on appeal \"is a\n\nvirtually   ironclad         rule\"    in    this   circuit,     Cochran      v.   Quest\n\nSoftware, Inc., 328 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2003), and this case\n\npresents no excusatory circumstances sufficient to persuade us to\n\nrelax the rule.\n\n            Gannett's agency theory is properly before us — but it is\n\nunavailing. He says, in effect, that the debtor was Stephen Carp's\n\nagent because they had been married for over thirty years and had\n\nbeen involved in real estate projects together in the past.                          The\n\nbankruptcy court rejected this theory on the merits.                       That ruling\n\nis beyond reproof.\n\n            The sins of the husband are not automatically visited\n\nupon the wife.     Thus, the existence of a marital relationship does\n\n\n                                           -17-\n\fnot itself prove an agency relationship.         See Rousseau v. Gelinas,\n\n507 N.E.2d 265, 268 (Mass. App. Ct. 1987);          Fennell v. Wyzik, 422\n\nN.E.2d 1387, 1389 (Mass. App. Ct. 1981).5         Similarly, the fact that\n\nthe   Carps    may   have   done    business   together   in   the   past   is\n\ninsufficient to show that the bankruptcy court committed clear\n\nerror in finding a lack of agency vis-à-vis the Newton property.\n\nSee Dudley v. Hannaford Bros. Co., 333 F.3d 299, 311 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (explaining that \"[w]hen a [trial] court chooses between two\n\nplausible but conflicting interpretations of the evidence, its\n\nchoice cannot be clearly erroneous\"); Valentin v. Hosp. Bella\n\nVista, 254 F.3d 358, 367 (1st Cir. 2001) (similar).\n\n              Gannett has yet another string to his bow.              In the\n\ncriminal case, Stephen Carp admitted to being the equitable owner\n\nof the Newton property.            Building on this foundation, Gannett\n\ncontends that the debtor also had an undisclosed equitable interest\n\nin that property because, under Massachusetts law, Stephen Carp's\n\nequitable interest would become a part of their marital estate upon\n\ndivorce.      Gannett insists that the failure to list this interest\n\nrendered the debtor's oath false (and, thus, violated 11 U.S.C. §\n\n727(a)(4)).\n\n\n      5\n      Of course, marital partners may be each other's agents if\nother factors lead to that conclusion. See, e.g., Fennell, 422\nN.E.2d at 1389 (imputing misrepresentation of wife to husband when\nthe couple jointly owned the subject property, the wife held\nherself out as able to speak authoritatively as to the condition of\nthe property, and the couple had communicated about the relevant\nissues). The record in the case at hand lacks any such evidence.\n\n                                      -18-\n\f          The bankruptcy court found that this circumstance did not\n\ncompel the conclusion that the debtor erred in not listing that\n\ninterest as part of her bankruptcy estate.    In this regard, the\n\nbankruptcy court noted that the debtor had made no contribution to\n\nthe purchase of the Newton property and had no interest in it at\n\nthe time of the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n          As a matter of law, the bankruptcy court was correct.\n\nCf. id. § 541(a)(5)(B) (stating that property received as a result\n\nof a property settlement or agreement of divorce is property of the\n\nestate if the debtor acquires or becomes entitled to acquire it\n\nwithin 180 days of the date of filing bankruptcy).      Thus, even\n\nassuming for argument's sake that Stephen Carp's equitable interest\n\nin the Newton property was part of the marital estate — a matter on\n\nwhich we take no view — it was not property of the debtor's\n\nbankruptcy estate at the relevant time.\n\n          At the risk of carting coal to Newcastle, we add that\n\neven were we to classify this contingent interest as property of\n\nthe bankruptcy estate, that fact alone would not be enough to\n\ntrigger section 727(a)(4).   Gannett would still have to show that\n\nthe exclusion of the property from the debtor's schedules was done\n\nwith intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors.   It is not at\n\nall difficult to imagine innocent reasons for the failure to\n\nmention such a contingent interest — especially since the debtor\n\ntestified (credibly, in the bankruptcy court's estimation) that she\n\n\n                               -19-\n\fwas unaware that she held any such interest.     To the extent that\n\nGannett invites us to declare as a matter of law that a spouse's\n\nfailure to include a contingent and as yet undetermined interest in\n\nreal property — an interest that will arise only in the event of\n\ndivorce — in a bankruptcy petition warrants denial of a discharge,\n\nwe decline the invitation.\n\n          Gannett's last-ditch claim is that the debtor should have\n\nbeen denied a discharge because she used and controlled automobiles\n\nthat were omitted from her bankruptcy schedules.        This claim\n\nfocuses on the debtor's assertion that she did not own even one\n\ncar, yet her two children (neither of whom were employed full-time)\n\nowned three vehicles between them.     Gannett argued vigorously to\n\nthe bankruptcy court that the debtor placed the automobiles in her\n\nchildren's names for the purpose of defrauding creditors.         The\n\nbankruptcy court did not buy the argument.\n\n          The situation as to ownership of the vehicles strikes us\n\nas irregular.   We are not, however, a court of first instance.   The\n\nbankruptcy judge saw and heard the witnesses and found the debtor\n\nto be credible.   The mere fact that the situation seems suspect is\n\nnot sufficient to justify disregarding this credibility call.     See\n\nIn re Burgess, 955 F.2d at 137.    The bankruptcy court reasonably\n\ncould have believed, for example, that the placing of title in the\n\nchildren's names was simply another manifestation of Stephen Carp's\n\nscheming, and that the debtor was unaware of his connivance. Given\n\n\n                                -20-\n\fthis record, there is no principled way in which we can disturb the\n\nbankruptcy court's judgment.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n            We need go no further.   It is not enough that reasonable\n\nminds   might   differ   regarding   either   the   bankruptcy   court's\n\nmanagement of pretrial discovery or its evaluation of the evidence\n\npresented at trial.      For the reasons elucidated above, we uphold\n\nboth the bankruptcy court's decision and the district court's\n\naffirmance of that decision.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\f",

The bankruptcy court declined to default or sanction the debtor for claiming her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, determined that she had not transgressed the strictures of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a), and granted the discharge. The district court affirmed these rulings, and the creditor now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the creditor that there are suspicious circumstances here. As an appellate court, however, we are not free to second-guess the management of pretrial discovery, weigh the evidence afresh, or make independent judgments about the credibility of witnesses. Instead, our function is to examine the record with care, defer to the properly supported factual findings of the court of first instance, determine the applicable law, and ensure that the trier properly applied it to the facts as found. Having performed these tasks, we conclude, as did the district court, that the decision of the bankruptcy court is impervious to the creditor's attack.

We do not here attempt to rehearse the entire history of the case, but, rather, offer a synopsis of the facts designed to give needed context to the issues on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joan E. Carp (the debtor) and her husband, Stephen Carp, filed a joint petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in February 1995. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 701-784. Among the affected creditors was the appellant, Richard W. Gannett. Gannett filed a timely proof of claim for $82,093.85, plus interest and costs, arising out of the rendition of legal services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several months later, Gannett commenced an adversary proceeding, objecting to the Carps' proposed discharge in bankruptcy. He relied on 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(2) and (4), arguing that the Carps had willfully failed to disclose their ownership interests in a number of assets, including a parcel of real property located at 824 Dedham Street, Newton, Massachusetts (the Newton property) and three automobiles. With regard to the Newton property Gannett asserted that the Carps owned an equitable interest in it even though legal title reposed in one Mordechay Pupkin. Gannett further asserted that the Carps were using Pupkin as a straw in order to defraud creditors; that they had funded Pupkin's mortgage payments; and that any semblance of rental payments was a sham. With respect to the cars, Gannett alleged that the Carps had attempted to defraud their creditors by giving their children legal title to the automobiles. He argued that it was absurd to think that the children owned three vehicles while the parents themselves owned none. The Carps denied the material allegations of Gannett's complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say that matters did not proceed smoothly would be a gross understatement. Gannett served deposition notices and interrogatories in October 1995 and added a request for production of documents in January of the following year. On February 29, 1996, he moved to compel, pointing out that the Carps had not replied to these discovery requests. The bankruptcy court granted the motion. When the Carps still did not cooperate, Gannett moved for the entry of a default judgment. The Carps responded that they would not submit to discovery because they were the targets of a criminal investigation for bankruptcy fraud being conducted by the United States Department of Justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 16, 1996, the bankruptcy court again ordered the Carps to provide discovery. The court also imposed a $750 monetary sanction and continued Gannett's motion for entry of a default judgment. On August 22, 1996, the bankruptcy court denied that motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the criminal investigation went forward. On October 14, 1996, the government filed a criminal information against Stephen Carp, charging him with one count of bankruptcy fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 152, related to his alleged failure to disclose an equitable ownership interest in the Newton property. On April 27, 1997, Stephen Carp pled guilty to this charge. The district court sentenced him the next day.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court had wisely continued the case until the outcome of the criminal prosecution was finally determined. In the interim, the court maintained careful watch, holding no fewer than five status conferences from the fall of 1996 through the spring of 1997. From time to time, Gannett mentioned that he was still awaiting discovery materials but no action was taken. At a status conference held on April 24, 1997, Gannett again raised the issue, and the debtor acknowledged that she had not yet complied with the discovery orders because of her asserted Fifth Amendment privilege. The court stated that there was no point in attempting to press forward with discovery if the debtor was going to plead the Fifth Amendment and directed the parties to file a joint status report following Stephen Carp's sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the criminal prosecution had ended<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the adversary proceeding against Stephen Carp had been resolved, <i>see supra</i> note 1, the bankruptcy court set a trial date for the adversary proceeding against the debtor. Prior to the scheduled start of trial, the trustee in bankruptcy moved to consolidate that proceeding with an adversary proceeding that he (the trustee) had brought against Pupkin. The court consolidated the two actions and vacated the scheduled trial date. The trustee eventually settled with Pupkin, thus undoing the consolidation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next bump in this long and winding road occurred in April of 2001 when the bankruptcy court scheduled an evidentiary hearing on the debtor's discharge for October 3 of that year. Gannett dawdled for several months and then, on August 23, filed a renewed motion for entry of a default judgment or, in the alternative, for additional time to conduct discovery. At a hearing held on September 24, the court denied both prayers on condition that the debtor submit to a deposition prior to trial and produce the previously requested documents before the deposition. The debtor delivered the designated documents and appeared for a deposition on October 1. Although she did not assert her Fifth Amendment privilege, she nonetheless refused to answer certain questions pursuant to her counsel's instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gannett made no further complaint about inadequate or untimely discovery, and the bankruptcy court conducted the previously scheduled bench trial on October 3. The debtor testified without asserting any privilege against self-incrimination. In an <i>ore tenus</i> decision, the bankruptcy court found the debtor credible and concluded that there was insufficient proof that she had either knowingly concealed property or vouchsafed a false oath. Discerning no basis for the denial of a discharge, the court entered judgment accordingly. The district court affirmed, <i>see Gannett v. Carp (In re Carp),</i> No. 02-10086 (D.Mass. Aug. 30, 2002) (unpublished), and this appeal followed.

Watman</i> (<i>In re Watman</i>), 301 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir.2002). We scrutinize that court's findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <i>Id.</i> The application of the Bankruptcy Code to a particular case poses a mixed question of law and fact, which this court reviews for clear error unless the bankruptcy court's analysis was based on a mistaken view of the legal principles involved. <i>See Miller v. Peterson (In re Indep. Eng'g Co.</i>), 197 F.3d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1999). Under the clear error standard, the trier's findings of fact and the conclusions drawn therefrom ought not to be set aside \"unless, on the whole of the record, we form a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\" <i>Cumpiano v. Banco Santander,</i> 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990). It follows that if the bankruptcy court's findings are supportable on any reasonable view of the record, we are bound to uphold them. <i>See Boroff v. Tully</i> (<i>In re Tully</i>), 818 F.2d 106, 109 (1st Cir.1987); <i>see also Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co.,</i> 900 F.2d 388, 392 (1st Cir.1990) (warning that appellate review of \"fact-dominated issues cannot be allowed to descend to the level of Monday-morning quarter-backing\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>The Merits</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Gannett's asseverations are not neatly segregated, we distill them into two principal lines of argument. First, he challenges the bankruptcy court's decision to allow the debtor to testify without penalty after repeatedly having invoked the Fifth Amendment to insulate herself from furnishing discovery &#8212; and he couples this challenge with a more general objection to the court's oversight of the discovery process. Second, he calumnizes the bankruptcy court for its refusal to block the debtor's discharge under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a). We discuss these two lines of argument sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>A.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>The Fifth Amendment</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to those contentions related to the debtor's invocation of the Fifth Amendment. We review a bankruptcy court's discovery decisions for abuse of discretion &#8212; and that discretion is very wide. <i>Brandt v. Wand Partners,</i> 242 F.3d 6, 18 (1st Cir.2001). The fact that the Fifth Amendment is implicated in Gannett's litany of discovery-related complaints does not serve to alter this standard of review. <i>See Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena,</i> 882 F.2d 553, 575-77 (1st Cir.1989); <i>see also Serafino v. Hasbro, Inc.,</i> 82 F.3d 515, 518 (1st Cir.1996). Unless we can fairly say that the bankruptcy court abused this wide discretion, its management of the pretrial discovery process must be respected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a matter of law, Gannett's claim that the bankruptcy court should not have allowed the debtor to testify without sanction lacks force. Gannett does not dispute &#8212; nor could he &#8212; that a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding can invoke the Fifth Amendment. <i>See, e.g., McCormick v. Banc One Leasing Corp.</i> (<i>In re McCormick</i>), 49 F.3d 1524, 1526 (11th Cir.1995); <i>Martin-Trigona v. Belford</i> (<i>In re Martin-Trigona</i>), 732 F.2d 170, 175 (2d Cir.1984). He does not allege-nor could he on this record &#8212; that the debtor's invocation of the privilege was chimerical or otherwise improper. Rather, Gannett's thesis is that pleading the Fifth Amendment in a civil proceeding should yield consequences, and that the condign consequence of the debtor's action should have been preclusion. In other words, the bankruptcy court ought not to have allowed the debtor to testify because she did not provide discovery until the eve of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short answer to this importuning is that Gannett did not preserve the issue for appeal. After the documents were finally tendered and the deposition held, Gannett never complained to the bankruptcy court that the discovery was either too scanty or too tardy. By the same token, he did not question the propriety of the objections interposed by the debtor's counsel during the deposition. To cap matters, far from asserting that the debtor's testimony should be precluded by her longstanding invocation of the Fifth Amendment, he himself called the debtor to the witness stand. If delayed discovery, once received, is incomplete, inadequate, or timed so as to impede effective trial preparation, the aggrieved party must object in advance of trial. The failure to do so constitutes a failure to raise the issue at the proper time and in the proper setting. That failure bars the aggrieved party from raising the issue on appeal. <i>See Heming-way Trans., Inc. v. Kahn</i> (<i>In re Hemingway Trans., Inc.</i>), 993 F.2d 915, 935 (1st Cir.1993); <i>LaRoche v. Amoskeag Bank</i> (<i>In re LaRoche</i>), 969 F.2d 1299, 1305 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Gannett did assert at the September 24 hearing that the debtor should not be permitted to testify at trial because she had persistently invoked the Fifth Amendment. In response to that assertion, the bankruptcy court ordered that the debtor produce documents and submit to an immediate deposition. If this was not a satisfactory ameliorative, Gannett was obliged to renew his complaint following the receipt of the documents and the taking of the deposition. <i>Cf. DesRosiers v. Moran,</i> 949 F.2d 15, 22 (1st Cir.1991) (stating that when a party proceeds with trial without complaining about delayed discovery, the court will not permit that party to complain after judgment). He did not do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gannett's fallback position is that the bankruptcy court erred by refusing to enter a default judgment against the debtor. In the last analysis, however, the decision as to whether discovery sanctions are warranted and the choice of what sanctions should be imposed are matters within the sound discretion of the trial court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Poulin v. Greer,</i> 18 F.3d 979, 984 (1st Cir.1994). The disallowance of a discharge &#8212; which would have been the effective result of a default judgment in this case &#8212; is strong medicine. There is no basis either in the record or in the law for us to second-guess the bankruptcy court's discretionary refusal to prescribe so harsh a penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a modest variation on this theme, Gannett suggests that the bankruptcy court at least should have drawn a negative inference against the debtor due to her repeated invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege. But in a civil proceeding, the drawing of a negative inference is a permissible, but not an ineluctable, concomitant of a party's invocation of the Fifth Amendment. <i>See Mulero-Rodr&#237;guez v. Ponte, Inc.,</i> 98 F.3d 670, 678 (1st Cir.1996). While the law does not forbid adverse inferences against civil litigants who refuse to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds, <i>see Baxter v. Palmigiano,</i> 425 U.S. 308, 318, 96 S.Ct. 1551, 47 L.Ed.2d 810 (1976), it does not mandate such inferences. When all is said and done, the trial court has discretion over whether a negative inference is an appropriate response to the invocation of the Fifth Amendment in a particular civil case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court, in the exercise of this discretion, chose not to draw such an inference here. The record evinces no special factors suggesting that this choice was arbitrary or capricious, and we are hesitant to overturn a trial court's discretionary decision to afford an extra measure of protection to a litigant's constitutional right against self-incrimination. <i>Cf. Serafino,</i> 82 F.3d at 518 (emphasizing that courts must take special pains to ensure that the Fifth Amendment privilege is safeguarded). There was no error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We give short shrift to Gannett's final discovery-related point: that the bankruptcy court failed to balance Gannett's right to a fair trial against the debtor's Fifth Amendment interests. Once again, the specter of a procedural default looms. Although Gannett did object generally to the bankruptcy court's management of the discovery process, he never specifically asserted an infringement of his right to a fair trial. More importantly, he did not make any claim regarding the unfairness of proceeding after he had secured discovery. Thus, the bankruptcy court had neither the occasion nor the opportunity to decide whether the discovery that Gannett belatedly received was sufficient to cure any prior harm. If that discovery &#8212; i.e., the document production and deposition&#8212;had not rectified the situation and restored the balance, Gannett had an affirmative obligation to come forward and request further relief from the court. <i>See Macaulay v. Anas,</i> 321 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir.2003) (holding that \"[a] party who has the opportunity to ask the trial court for relief but fails to do so forfeits the right to claim, on appeal, that the relief should have been granted\"); <i>Anderson,</i> 900 F.2d at 397 (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were we to reach the merits of this claim, Gannett's cause would not prosper. He relies chiefly upon our <i>Serafino</i> decision to undergird the argument that the bankruptcy court failed adequately to consider his right to a fair trial. But that decision simply cannot support the weight that Gannett places upon it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that <i>Serafino</i> stands for the proposition that \"one party's assertion of his constitutional right should not obliterate another party's right to a fair proceeding.\" 82 F.3d at 518. It is also true, however, that the balancing of these factors is left largely to the informed discretion of the trial court. <i>See id.</i> The court need not make an elaborate series of written findings. <i>Cf. United States v. De La Cruz,</i> 902 F.2d 121, 123-24 &amp; n. 1 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that explicit findings as to the probative worth/prejudicial effect balance under Evidence Rule 403 are not always required). What counts is that the court's implicit conclusion &#8212; that Gannett would receive a fair trial notwithstanding the delayed discovery &#8212; is satisfactorily anchored in the record. After all, the bankruptcy court made significant efforts to ensure that Gannett could gain access, prior to trial, to the information necessary to prosecute his case. Moreover, Gannett never identified what information he coveted that was not available from other sources. Under these circumstances, we are at a loss to see how Gannett's rights were unfairly impugned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>B.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gannett next contends that the bankruptcy court erred on the merits in granting the debtor a discharge. As the objecting party, Gannett had the burden of proving that the debtor should be denied a discharge. <i>See Commerce Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Burgess (In re Burgess</i>), 955 F.2d 134, 136 (1st Cir.1992), <i>abrogated on other grounds by Field v. Mans,</i> 516 U.S. 59, 72-75, 116 S.Ct. 437, 133 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995). Although the ultimate decision about whether to grant or withhold a discharge is a mixed question of law and fact, Gannett takes dead aim at the district court's factual findings. Accordingly, we \"review only for clear error, with `due regard ... to the opportunity of the bankruptcy court to judge the credibility of witnesses.'\" <i>In re Burgess,</i> 955 F.2d at 137 (quoting Fed.R.Bankr.P. 8013) (alteration in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gannett identifies two statutory bases for denying a discharge in this case. We treat these in the ensemble. In doing so, we note that one of the Bankruptcy Code's core purposes is to give worthy debtors a fresh start. <i>See Jamo v. Katahdin Fed. Credit Union (In re Jamo</i>), 283 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir.2002). Thus, exceptions to discharge should be construed narrowly. <i>Rutanen v. Baylis (In re Baylis</i>), 313 F.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir.2002). Gannett's first sortie involves section 727(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides in pertinent part that the bankruptcy court shall withhold a discharge if</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the debtor, with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor or an officer of the estate ... has transferred, removed, destroyed, mutilated, or concealed, or has permitted to be transferred, removed, destroyed, mutilated, or concealed &#8212; (A) property of the debtor, within one year before the date of the filing of the petition; or (B) property of the estate, after the date of the filing of the petition....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gannett's second sortie involves section 727(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides in pertinent part that a discharge shall not be granted if \"the debtor knowingly and fraudulently, in or in connection with the case &#8212; (A) made a false oath or account.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 727(a)(4). Under that proviso, a discharge can be refused only if the false oath \"relat[ed] to a material fact.\" <i>In re Tully,</i> 818 F.2d at 110.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of these provisions requires a showing of fraudulent intent. <i>See In re Chavin,</i> 150 F.3d 726, 727 (7th Cir.1998). The bankruptcy court found that Gannett had failed to make this showing. Because the determination of intent depends largely upon an assessment of the debtor's credibility, respect for the bankruptcy court's factual findings is particularly appropriate in this context. <i>See In re Burgess,</i> 955 F.2d at 137. Even when the totality of the circumstances might plausibly support an inference of skullduggery, the bankruptcy court's contrary finding must be credited unless the evidence is so one-sided as to compel the inference of fraud. <i>See Palmacci v. Umpierrez,</i> 121 F.3d 781, 790 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the bankruptcy court found the debtor to be completely credible, and Gannett's insinuations certainly do not compel the opposite conclusion. That seemingly ends the matter. <i>In re Burgess,</i> 955 F.2d at 137. Gannett, however, seeks to capsize the bankruptcy court's finding on the ground that intent or culpability should be imputed to the debtor because her husband acted fraudulently (a fact that is, at this stage, beyond cavil) and she was her husband's alter ego or agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not reach the merits of the first of these suggestions because Gannett neglected to raise the alter ego theory before the bankruptcy court. <i>See In re LaRoche,</i> 969 F.2d at 1305 (holding that a failure to advance an issue before the bankruptcy court forfeits the right to raise it on appeal). That a party may not advance an argument for the first time on appeal \"is a virtually ironclad rule\" in this circuit, <i>Cochran v. Quest Software, Inc.,</i> 328 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.2003), and this case presents no excusatory circumstances sufficient to persuade us to relax the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gannett's agency theory is properly before us &#8212; but it is unavailing. He says, in effect, that the debtor was Stephen Carp's agent because they had been married for over thirty years and had been involved in real estate projects together in the past. The bankruptcy court rejected this theory on the merits. That ruling is beyond reproof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sins of the husband are not automatically visited upon the wife. Thus, the existence of a marital relationship does not itself prove an agency relationship. <i>See Rousseau v. Gelinas,</i> 24 Mass.App.Ct. 154, 507 N.E.2d 265, 268 (1987); <i>Fennell v. Wyzik,</i> 12 Mass.App.Ct. 909, 422 N.E.2d 1387, 1389 (1981).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Similarly, the fact that the Carps may have done business together in the past is insufficient to show that the bankruptcy court committed clear error in finding a lack of agency vis-&#224;-vis the Newton property. <i>See Dudley v. Hannaford Bros. Co.,</i> 333 F.3d 299, 311 (1st Cir.2003) (explaining that \"[w]hen a [trial] court chooses between two plausible but conflicting interpretations of the evidence, its choice cannot be clearly erroneous\"); <i>Valentin v. Hosp. Bella Vista,</i> 254 F.3d 358, 367 (1st Cir.2001) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gannett has yet another string to his bow. In the criminal case, Stephen Carp admitted to being the equitable owner of the Newton property. Building on this foundation, Gannett contends that the debtor also had an undisclosed equitable interest in that property because, under Massachusetts law, Stephen Carp's equitable interest would become a part of their marital estate upon divorce. Gannett insists that the failure to list this interest rendered the debtor's oath false (and, thus, violated 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(4)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court found that this circumstance did not compel the conclusion that the debtor erred in not listing that interest as part of her bankruptcy estate. In this regard, the bankruptcy court noted that the debtor had made no contribution to the purchase of the Newton property and had no interest in it at the time of the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a matter of law, the bankruptcy court was correct. <i>Cf. id.</i> &#167; 541(a)(5)(B) (stating that property received as a result of a property settlement or agreement of divorce is property of the estate if the debtor acquires or becomes entitled to acquire it within 180 days of the date of filing bankruptcy). Thus, even assuming for argument's sake that Stephen Carp's equitable interest in the Newton property was part of the marital estate &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; it was not property of the debtor's bankruptcy estate at the relevant time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the risk of carting coal to Newcastle, we add that even were we to classify this contingent interest as property of the bankruptcy estate, that fact alone would not be enough to trigger section 727(a)(4). Gannett would still have to show that the exclusion of the property from the debtor's schedules was done with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors. It is not at all difficult to imagine innocent reasons for the failure to mention such a contingent interest &#8212; especially since the debtor testified (credibly, in the bankruptcy court's estimation) that she was unaware that she held any such interest. To the extent that Gannett invites us to declare as a matter of law that a spouse's failure to include a contingent and as yet undetermined interest in real property &#8212; an interest that will arise only in the event of divorce &#8212; in a bankruptcy petition warrants denial of a discharge, we decline the invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gannett's last-ditch claim is that the debtor should have been denied a discharge because she used and controlled automobiles that were omitted from her bankruptcy schedules. This claim focuses on the debtor's assertion that she did not own even one car, yet her two children (neither of whom were employed full-time) owned three vehicles between them. Gannett argued vigorously to the bankruptcy court that the debtor placed the automobiles in her children's names for the purpose of defrauding creditors. The bankruptcy court did not buy the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation as to ownership of the vehicles strikes us as irregular. We are not, however, a court of first instance. The bankruptcy judge saw and heard the witnesses and found the debtor to be credible. The mere fact that the situation seems suspect is not sufficient to justify disregarding this credibility call. <i>See In re Burgess,</i> 955 F.2d at 137. The bankruptcy court reasonably could have believed, for example, that the placing of title in the children's names was simply another manifestation of Stephen Carp's scheming, and that the debtor was unaware of his connivance. Given this record, there is no principled way in which we can disturb the bankruptcy court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>IV.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. It is not enough that reasonable minds might differ regarding either the bankruptcy court's management of pretrial discovery or its evaluation of the evidence presented at trial.

The bankruptcy court declined to default or sanction the debtor for claiming her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, determined that she had not transgressed the strictures of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a), and granted the discharge. The district court affirmed these rulings, and the creditor now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the creditor that there are suspicious circumstances here. As an appellate court, however, we are not free to second-guess the management of pretrial discovery, weigh the evidence afresh, or make independent judgments about the credibility of witnesses. Instead, our function is to examine the record with care, defer to the properly supported factual findings of the court of first instance, determine the applicable law, and ensure that the trier properly applied it to the facts as found. Having performed these tasks, we conclude, as did the district court, that the decision of the bankruptcy court is impervious to the creditor's attack. Consequently, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Background</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The underlying bankruptcy proceeding has been pending since 1995. We do not here attempt to rehearse the entire history of the case, but, rather, offer a synopsis of the facts designed to give needed context to the issues on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joan E. Carp (the debtor) and her husband, Stephen Carp, filed a joint petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in February 1995. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 701-784. Among the affected creditors was the appellant, Richard W. Gannett. Gannett filed a timely proof of claim for $82,093.85, plus interest and costs, arising out of the rendition of legal services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several months later, Gannett commenced an adversary proceeding, objecting to the Carps' proposed discharge in bankruptcy. He relied on 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(2) and (4), arguing that the Carps had willfully failed to disclose their ownership interests in a number of assets, including a parcel of real property located at 824 Dedham Street, Newton, Massachusetts (the Newton property) and three automobiles. With regard to the Newton property Gannett asserted that the Carps owned an equitable interest in it even though legal title reposed in one Mordechay Pupkin. Gannett further asserted that the Carps were using Pupkin as a straw in order to defraud creditors; that they had funded Pupkin's mortgage payments; and that any semblance of rental payments was a sham. With respect to the cars, Gannett alleged that the Carps had attempted to defraud their creditors by giving their children legal title to the automobiles. He argued that it was absurd to think that the children owned three vehicles while the parents themselves owned none. The Carps denied the material allegations of Gannett's complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say that matters did not proceed smoothly would be a gross understatement. Gannett served deposition notices and interrogatories in October 1995 and added a request for production of documents in January of the following year. On February 29, 1996, he moved to compel, pointing out that the Carps had not replied to these discovery requests. The bankruptcy court granted the motion. When the Carps still did not cooperate, Gannett moved for the entry of a default judgment. The Carps responded that they would not submit to discovery because they were the targets of a criminal investigation for bankruptcy fraud being conducted by the United States Department of Justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 16, 1996, the bankruptcy court again ordered the Carps to provide discovery. The court also imposed a $750 monetary sanction and continued Gannett's motion for entry of a default judgment. On August 22, 1996, the bankruptcy court denied that motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the criminal investigation went forward. On October 14, 1996, the government filed a criminal information against Stephen Carp, charging him with one count of bankruptcy fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 152, related to his alleged failure to disclose an equitable ownership interest in the Newton property. On April 27, 1997, Stephen Carp pled guilty to this charge. The district court sentenced him the next day.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court had wisely continued the case until the outcome of the criminal prosecution was finally determined. In the interim, the court maintained careful watch, holding no fewer than five status conferences from the fall of 1996 through the spring of 1997. From time to time, Gannett mentioned that he was still awaiting discovery materials but no action was taken. At a status conference held on April 24, 1997, Gannett again raised the issue, and the debtor acknowledged that she had not yet complied with the discovery orders because of her asserted Fifth Amendment privilege. The court stated that there was no point in attempting to press forward with discovery if the debtor was going to plead the Fifth Amendment and directed the parties to file a joint status report following Stephen Carp's sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the criminal prosecution had ended<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the adversary proceeding against Stephen Carp had been resolved, <i>see supra</i> note 1, the bankruptcy court set a trial date for the adversary proceeding against the debtor. Prior to the scheduled start of trial, the trustee in bankruptcy moved to consolidate that proceeding with an adversary proceeding that he (the trustee) had brought against Pupkin. The court consolidated the two actions and vacated the scheduled trial date. The trustee eventually settled with Pupkin, thus undoing the consolidation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next bump in this long and winding road occurred in April of 2001 when the bankruptcy court scheduled an evidentiary hearing on the debtor's discharge for October 3 of that year. Gannett dawdled for several months and then, on August 23, filed a renewed motion for entry of a default judgment or, in the alternative, for additional time to conduct discovery. At a hearing held on September 24, the court denied both prayers on condition that the debtor submit to a deposition prior to trial and produce the previously requested documents before the deposition. The debtor delivered the designated documents and appeared for a deposition on October 1. Although she did not assert her Fifth Amendment privilege, she nonetheless refused to answer certain questions pursuant to her counsel's instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gannett made no further complaint about inadequate or untimely discovery, and the bankruptcy court conducted the previously scheduled bench trial on October 3. The debtor testified without asserting any privilege against self-incrimination. In an <i>ore tenus</i> decision, the bankruptcy court found the debtor credible and concluded that there was insufficient proof that she had either knowingly concealed property or vouchsafed a false oath. Discerning no basis for the denial of a discharge, the court entered judgment accordingly. The district court affirmed, <i>see Gannett v. Carp (In re Carp),</i> No. 02-10086 (D.Mass. Aug. 30, 2002) (unpublished), and this appeal followed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 158(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>II.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Standard of Review</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the fact that we are the second-in-time reviewers, we cede no special deference to the district court's determinations. <i>Brandt v.

Rather, our review directly addresses the bankruptcy court's decision. <i>Gronan v.

We scrutinize that court's findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <i>Id.</i> The application of the Bankruptcy Code to a particular case poses a mixed question of law and fact, which this court reviews for clear error unless the bankruptcy court's analysis was based on a mistaken view of the legal principles involved. <i>See Miller v. Peterson (In re Indep. Eng'g Co.</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766829\"><a href=\"/opinion/766829/in-re-independent-engineering-company-inc-debtor-thomas-miller-esq/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1999). Under the clear error standard, the trier's findings of fact and the conclusions drawn therefrom ought not to be set aside \"unless, on the whole of the record, we form a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\" <i>Cumpiano v.

It follows that if the bankruptcy court's findings are supportable on any reasonable view of the record, we are bound to uphold them. <i>See Boroff v. Tully</i> (<i>In re Tully</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488021\"><a href=\"/opinion/488021/bankr-l-rep-p-71787-in-re-john-e-tully-debtor-henry-j-boroff/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 109 (1st Cir.1987); <i>see also Anderson v.

First, he challenges the bankruptcy court's decision to allow the debtor to testify without penalty after repeatedly having invoked the Fifth Amendment to insulate herself from furnishing discovery &#8212; and he couples this challenge with a more general objection to the court's oversight of the discovery process. Second, he calumnizes the bankruptcy court for its refusal to block the debtor's discharge under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a). We discuss these two lines of argument sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>A.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>The Fifth Amendment</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to those contentions related to the debtor's invocation of the Fifth Amendment. We review a bankruptcy court's discovery decisions for abuse of discretion &#8212; and that discretion is very wide. <i>Brandt v. Wand Partners,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199295\"><a href=\"/opinion/199295/brandt-v-wand-partners/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2001). The fact that the Fifth Amendment is implicated in Gannett's litany of discovery-related complaints does not serve to alter this standard of review. <i>See Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527780\"><a href=\"/opinion/527780/carlos-a-gutierrez-rodriguez-v-desiderio-cartagena-and-domingo-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span>, 575-77 (1st Cir.1989); <i>see also Serafino v. Hasbro, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196719\"><a href=\"/opinion/196719/serafino-v-hasbro-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span>, 518 (1st Cir.1996). Unless we can fairly say that the bankruptcy court abused this wide discretion, its management of the pretrial discovery process must be respected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a matter of law, Gannett's claim that the bankruptcy court should not have allowed the debtor to testify without sanction lacks force. Gannett does not dispute &#8212; nor could he &#8212; that a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding can invoke the Fifth Amendment. <i>See, e.g., McCormick v. Banc One Leasing Corp.</i> (<i>In re McCormick</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691403\"><a href=\"/opinion/691403/in-re-timothy-w-mccormick-debtor-timothy-w-mccormick-v-banc-one-leasing/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1524</span></a></span>, 1526 (11th Cir.1995); <i>Martin-Trigona v. Belford</i> (<i>In re Martin-Trigona</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"434656\"><a href=\"/opinion/434656/in-re-anthony-r-martin-trigona-debtor-anthony-r-martin-trigona-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">732</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span>, 175 (2d Cir.1984). He does not allege-nor could he on this record &#8212; that the debtor's invocation of the privilege was chimerical or otherwise improper. Rather, Gannett's thesis is that pleading the Fifth Amendment in a civil proceeding should yield consequences, and that the condign consequence of the debtor's action should have been preclusion. In other words, the bankruptcy court ought not to have allowed the debtor to testify because she did not provide discovery until the eve of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short answer to this importuning is that Gannett did not preserve the issue for appeal. After the documents were finally tendered and the deposition held, Gannett never complained to the bankruptcy court that the discovery was either too scanty or too tardy. By the same token, he did not question the propriety of the objections interposed by the debtor's counsel during the deposition. To cap matters, far from asserting that the debtor's testimony should be precluded by her longstanding invocation of the Fifth Amendment, he himself called the debtor to the witness stand. If delayed discovery, once received, is incomplete, inadequate, or timed so as to impede effective trial preparation, the aggrieved party must object in advance of trial. The failure to do so constitutes a failure to raise the issue at the proper time and in the proper setting. That failure bars the aggrieved party from raising the issue on appeal. <i>See Heming-way Trans., Inc. v. Kahn</i> (<i>In re Hemingway Trans., Inc.</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607104\"><a href=\"/opinion/607104/in-re-hemingway-transport-inc-debtors-juniper-development-group-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">915</span></a></span>, 935 (1st Cir.1993); <i>LaRoche v. Amoskeag Bank</i> (<i>In re LaRoche</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587244\"><a href=\"/opinion/587244/in-re-david-f-laroche-david-f-laroche-v-amoskeag-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span>, 1305 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Gannett did assert at the September 24 hearing that the debtor should not be permitted to testify at trial because she had persistently invoked the Fifth Amendment. In response to that assertion, the bankruptcy court ordered that the debtor produce documents and submit to an immediate deposition. If this was not a satisfactory ameliorative, Gannett was obliged to renew his complaint following the receipt of the documents and the taking of the deposition. <i>Cf. DesRosiers v. Moran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572165\"><a href=\"/opinion/572165/steven-m-desrosiers-v-john-j-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1991) (stating that when a party proceeds with trial without complaining about delayed discovery, the court will not permit that party to complain after judgment). He did not do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gannett's fallback position is that the bankruptcy court erred by refusing to enter a default judgment against the debtor. In the last analysis, however, the decision as to whether discovery sanctions are warranted and the choice of what sanctions should be imposed are matters within the sound discretion of the trial court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Poulin v. Greer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195263\"><a href=\"/opinion/195263/poulin-v-greer/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">979</span></a></span>, 984 (1st Cir.1994). The disallowance of a discharge &#8212; which would have been the effective result of a default judgment in this case &#8212; is strong medicine. There is no basis either in the record or in the law for us to second-guess the bankruptcy court's discretionary refusal to prescribe so harsh a penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a modest variation on this theme, Gannett suggests that the bankruptcy court at least should have drawn a negative inference against the debtor due to her repeated invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege. But in a civil proceeding, the drawing of a negative inference is a permissible, but not an ineluctable, concomitant of a party's invocation of the Fifth Amendment. <i>See Mulero-Rodr&#237;guez v. Ponte, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728081\"><a href=\"/opinion/728081/72-fair-emplpraccas-bna-406-69-empl-prac-dec-p-44437-gilberto/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">670</span></a></span>, 678 (1st Cir.1996). While the law does not forbid adverse inferences against civil litigants who refuse to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds, <i>see Baxter v. Palmigiano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109429\"><a href=\"/opinion/109429/baxter-v-palmigiano/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 318, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109429\"><a href=\"/opinion/109429/baxter-v-palmigiano/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></a></span> (1976), it does not mandate such inferences. When all is said and done, the trial court has discretion over whether a negative inference is an appropriate response to the invocation of the Fifth Amendment in a particular civil case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court, in the exercise of this discretion, chose not to draw such an inference here. The record evinces no special factors suggesting that this choice was arbitrary or capricious, and we are hesitant to overturn a trial court's discretionary decision to afford an extra measure of protection to a litigant's constitutional right against self-incrimination. <i>Cf. Serafino,</i> 82 F.3d at 518 (emphasizing that courts must take special pains to ensure that the Fifth Amendment privilege is safeguarded). There was no error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We give short shrift to Gannett's final discovery-related point: that the bankruptcy court failed to balance Gannett's right to a fair trial against the debtor's Fifth Amendment interests. Once again, the specter of a procedural default looms. Although Gannett did object generally to the bankruptcy court's management of the discovery process, he never specifically asserted an infringement of his right to a fair trial. More importantly, he did not make any claim regarding the unfairness of proceeding after he had secured discovery. Thus, the bankruptcy court had neither the occasion nor the opportunity to decide whether the discovery that Gannett belatedly received was sufficient to cure any prior harm. If that discovery &#8212; i.e., the document production and deposition&#8212;had not rectified the situation and restored the balance, Gannett had an affirmative obligation to come forward and request further relief from the court. <i>See Macaulay v. Anas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200359\"><a href=\"/opinion/200359/macaulay-v-anas/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.2003) (holding that \"[a] party who has the opportunity to ask the trial court for relief but fails to do so forfeits the right to claim, on appeal, that the relief should have been granted\"); <i>Anderson,</i> 900 F.2d at 397 (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were we to reach the merits of this claim, Gannett's cause would not prosper. He relies chiefly upon our <i>Serafino</i> decision to undergird the argument that the bankruptcy court failed adequately to consider his right to a fair trial. But that decision simply cannot support the weight that Gannett places upon it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that <i>Serafino</i> stands for the proposition that \"one party's assertion of his constitutional right should not obliterate another party's right to a fair proceeding.\" 82 F.3d at 518. It is also true, however, that the balancing of these factors is left largely to the informed discretion of the trial court. <i>See id.</i> The court need not make an elaborate series of written findings. <i>Cf. United States v. De La Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540778\"><a href=\"/opinion/540778/united-states-v-jose-manuel-de-la-cruz-aka-jose-manuel-linares-de-la/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span>, 123-24 &amp; n. 1 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that explicit findings as to the probative worth/prejudicial effect balance under Evidence Rule 403 are not always required). What counts is that the court's implicit conclusion &#8212; that Gannett would receive a fair trial notwithstanding the delayed discovery &#8212; is satisfactorily anchored in the record. After all, the bankruptcy court made significant efforts to ensure that Gannett could gain access, prior to trial, to the information necessary to prosecute his case. Moreover, Gannett never identified what information he coveted that was not available from other sources. Under these circumstances, we are at a loss to see how Gannett's rights were unfairly impugned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>B.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gannett next contends that the bankruptcy court erred on the merits in granting the debtor a discharge. As the objecting party, Gannett had the burden of proving that the debtor should be denied a discharge. <i>See Commerce Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Burgess (In re Burgess</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577012\"><a href=\"/opinion/577012/bankr-l-rep-p-74443-in-re-philip-n-burgess-jr-debtor-commerce-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 136 (1st Cir.1992), <i>abrogated on other grounds by Field v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span> (1995). Although the ultimate decision about whether to grant or withhold a discharge is a mixed question of law and fact, Gannett takes dead aim at the district court's factual findings. Accordingly, we \"review only for clear error, with `due regard ... to the opportunity of the bankruptcy court to judge the credibility of witnesses.'\" <i>In re Burgess,</i> 955 F.2d at 137 (quoting Fed.R.Bankr.P. 8013) (alteration in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gannett identifies two statutory bases for denying a discharge in this case. We treat these in the ensemble. In doing so, we note that one of the Bankruptcy Code's core purposes is to give worthy debtors a fresh start. <i>See Jamo v. Katahdin Fed. Credit Union (In re Jamo</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199890\"><a href=\"/opinion/199890/katahdin-federal-v-violette/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span>, 398 (1st Cir.2002). Thus, exceptions to discharge should be construed narrowly. <i>Rutanen v. Baylis (In re Baylis</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200238\"><a href=\"/opinion/200238/in-re-baylis-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2002). Gannett's first sortie involves section 727(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides in pertinent part that the bankruptcy court shall withhold a discharge if</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the debtor, with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor or an officer of the estate ... has transferred, removed, destroyed, mutilated, or concealed, or has permitted to be transferred, removed, destroyed, mutilated, or concealed &#8212; (A) property of the debtor, within one year before the date of the filing of the petition; or (B) property of the estate, after the date of the filing of the petition....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gannett's second sortie involves section 727(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides in pertinent part that a discharge shall not be granted if \"the debtor knowingly and fraudulently, in or in connection with the case &#8212; (A) made a false oath or account.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 727(a)(4). Under that proviso, a discharge can be refused only if the false oath \"relat[ed] to a material fact.\" <i>In re Tully,</i> 818 F.2d at 110.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of these provisions requires a showing of fraudulent intent. <i>See In re Chavin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756500\"><a href=\"/opinion/756500/bankr-l-rep-p-77736-in-re-leonard-chavin-debtor/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">726</span></a></span>, 727 (7th Cir.1998). The bankruptcy court found that Gannett had failed to make this showing. Because the determination of intent depends largely upon an assessment of the debtor's credibility, respect for the bankruptcy court's factual findings is particularly appropriate in this context. <i>See In re Burgess,</i> 955 F.2d at 137. Even when the totality of the circumstances might plausibly support an inference of skullduggery, the bankruptcy court's contrary finding must be credited unless the evidence is so one-sided as to compel the inference of fraud. <i>See Palmacci v. Umpierrez,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></span>, 790 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the bankruptcy court found the debtor to be completely credible, and Gannett's insinuations certainly do not compel the opposite conclusion. That seemingly ends the matter. <i>In re Burgess,</i> 955 F.2d at 137. Gannett, however, seeks to capsize the bankruptcy court's finding on the ground that intent or culpability should be imputed to the debtor because her husband acted fraudulently (a fact that is, at this stage, beyond cavil) and she was her husband's alter ego or agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not reach the merits of the first of these suggestions because Gannett neglected to raise the alter ego theory before the bankruptcy court. <i>See In re LaRoche,</i> 969 F.2d at 1305 (holding that a failure to advance an issue before the bankruptcy court forfeits the right to raise it on appeal). That a party may not advance an argument for the first time on appeal \"is a virtually ironclad rule\" in this circuit, <i>Cochran v. Quest Software, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200447\"><a href=\"/opinion/200447/cochran-v-quest-software-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.2003), and this case presents no excusatory circumstances sufficient to persuade us to relax the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gannett's agency theory is properly before us &#8212; but it is unavailing. He says, in effect, that the debtor was Stephen Carp's agent because they had been married for over thirty years and had been involved in real estate projects together in the past. The bankruptcy court rejected this theory on the merits. That ruling is beyond reproof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sins of the husband are not automatically visited upon the wife. Thus, the existence of a marital relationship does not itself prove an agency relationship. <i>See Rousseau v. Gelinas,</i> 24 Mass.App.Ct. 154, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2043805\"><a href=\"/opinion/2043805/rousseau-v-gelinas/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 268 (1987); <i>Fennell v.

Hannaford Bros. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200517\"><a href=\"/opinion/200517/dudley-v-hannaford-bros/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span>, 311 (1st Cir.2003) (explaining that \"[w]hen a [trial] court chooses between two plausible but conflicting interpretations of the evidence, its choice cannot be clearly erroneous\"); <i>Valentin v.

Bella Vista,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199467\"><a href=\"/opinion/199467/valentin-de-jesus-v-united-healthcare/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span>, 367 (1st Cir.2001) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gannett has yet another string to his bow. In the criminal case, Stephen Carp admitted to being the equitable owner of the Newton property. Building on this foundation, Gannett contends that the debtor also had an undisclosed equitable interest in that property because, under Massachusetts law, Stephen Carp's equitable interest would become a part of their marital estate upon divorce. Gannett insists that the failure to list this interest rendered the debtor's oath false (and, thus, violated 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(4)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court found that this circumstance did not compel the conclusion that the debtor erred in not listing that interest as part of her bankruptcy estate. In this regard, the bankruptcy court noted that the debtor had made no contribution to the purchase of the Newton property and had no interest in it at the time of the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a matter of law, the bankruptcy court was correct. <i>Cf. id.</i> &#167; 541(a)(5)(B) (stating that property received as a result of a property settlement or agreement of divorce is property of the estate if the debtor acquires or becomes entitled to acquire it within 180 days of the date of filing bankruptcy). Thus, even assuming for argument's sake that Stephen Carp's equitable interest in the Newton property was part of the marital estate &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; it was not property of the debtor's bankruptcy estate at the relevant time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the risk of carting coal to Newcastle, we add that even were we to classify this contingent interest as property of the bankruptcy estate, that fact alone would not be enough to trigger section 727(a)(4). Gannett would still have to show that the exclusion of the property from the debtor's schedules was done with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors. It is not at all difficult to imagine innocent reasons for the failure to mention such a contingent interest &#8212; especially since the debtor testified (credibly, in the bankruptcy court's estimation) that she was unaware that she held any such interest. To the extent that Gannett invites us to declare as a matter of law that a spouse's failure to include a contingent and as yet undetermined interest in real property &#8212; an interest that will arise only in the event of divorce &#8212; in a bankruptcy petition warrants denial of a discharge, we decline the invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gannett's last-ditch claim is that the debtor should have been denied a discharge because she used and controlled automobiles that were omitted from her bankruptcy schedules. This claim focuses on the debtor's assertion that she did not own even one car, yet her two children (neither of whom were employed full-time) owned three vehicles between them. Gannett argued vigorously to the bankruptcy court that the debtor placed the automobiles in her children's names for the purpose of defrauding creditors. The bankruptcy court did not buy the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation as to ownership of the vehicles strikes us as irregular. We are not, however, a court of first instance. The bankruptcy judge saw and heard the witnesses and found the debtor to be credible. The mere fact that the situation seems suspect is not sufficient to justify disregarding this credibility call. <i>See In re Burgess,</i> 955 F.2d at 137. The bankruptcy court reasonably could have believed, for example, that the placing of title in the children's names was simply another manifestation of Stephen Carp's scheming, and that the debtor was unaware of his connivance. Given this record, there is no principled way in which we can disturb the bankruptcy court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>IV.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. It is not enough that reasonable minds might differ regarding either the bankruptcy court's management of pretrial discovery or its evaluation of the evidence presented at trial. For the reasons elucidated above, we uphold both the bankruptcy court's decision and the district court's affirmance of that decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Following Stephen Carp's admission of guilt, Gannett moved for summary judgment against him in the pending adversary proceeding<i>See</i> Fed.R.Bankr.P. 7056.

But Gannett never advanced such a claim in the bankruptcy court, and he therefore has forfeited it</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Gannett's argument that the burden of persuasion should have shifted to the debtor as a result of her invocation of the Fifth Amendment is simply a restatement of the argument that the court should have drawn a negative inference against the debtor.
