R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                         For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 03-1591\n\n                              JOHN GRIFFITHS,\n\n                          Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                       v.\n\n                                    AMTRAK,\n\n                          Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n              [Hon. Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                         Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                             Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n    James J. Fusillo on brief for appellant.\n\n\n\n                               August 6, 2004\n\f       Per Curiam. In this retaliatory discharge case, the pro se\n\nplaintiff appeals from the district court's sua sponte dismissal of\n\nhis complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.                      We vacate\n\nthe judgment and remand the case to the district court for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n                                     BACKGROUND\n\n       Plaintiff filed a hand-written complaint alleging, in essence,\n\nthat defendant Amtrak discharged him in retaliation for complaining\n\nto the department of transportation about an unsafe crossing gate.\n\nIn his complaint, plaintiff alleged that the district court had\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332 (diversity jurisdiction) but\n\nalso     alleged     that    both    he   and    Amtrak     are   \"residents\"     of\n\nMassachusetts.\n\n        In   reviewing      the   complaint      in   the   course     of   allowing\n\nplaintiff's application to proceed in forma pauperis, the district\n\ncourt determined, sua sponte, that \"there is no diversity of\n\ncitizenship, and the Complaint discloses no other basis for the\n\nexercise of federal jurisdiction.\"                For that reason, the court\n\ndismissed      the    case    \"without      prejudice\"      and   directed      that\n\n\"[j]udgment may be entered accordingly.\"                Id.   The same day, the\n\nclerk    entered     judgment       dismissing    the     complaint,    but    \"with\n\nprejudice.\"     This appeal followed.           Br. Add. 3.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f                                     DISCUSSION\n\n     As we have previously warned, \"[c]ourts must move cautiously\n\nwhen dismissing a complaint sua sponte.\" Clorox Co. Puerto Rico v.\n\nProctor & Gamble Commercial Co., 228 F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nAlthough \"a district court may, in appropriate circumstances, note\n\nthe inadequacy of the complaint and, on its own initiative, dismiss\n\nthe complaint, . . . a court may not do so without at least giving\n\nplaintiffs notice of the proposed action and affording them an\n\nopportunity to address the issue.\"             Literature, Inc. v. Quinn, 482\n\nF.2d 372, 374 (1st Cir. 1973) (dicta).                  While this rule has\n\nexceptions, none is applicable here.\n\n     Although district courts are required to dismiss an action\n\n\"[w]henever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise\n\nthat the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter,\" Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(h)(3), \"[d]efective allegations of jurisdiction may be\n\namended,\" 28 U.S.C. § 1653; and such amendments may be made without\n\nleave of court, where, as here, no responsive pleading has been\n\nfiled.    Fed.      R.   Civ.   P.    15(a).      By   dismissing   plaintiff's\n\ncomplaint, sua sponte, without giving him prior notice of the\n\ndefect   in   his    jurisdictional      allegation,      the   district   court\n\ndeprived the plaintiff of his right to amend the complaint to cure\n\nthe defect.      The clerk then compounded the problem by entering\n\njudgment with prejudice--rather than without prejudice as the court\n\ndirected and as is appropriate for dismissals on jurisdictional\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fgrounds, 2 Moore's Fed. Prac. 3d § 12.30[2] at 12-36--thereby\n\nprecluding plaintiff from correcting his error by filing a new\n\naction.\n\n     Nor does plaintiff's in forma pauperis status afford a basis\n\nfor this dismissal.   Sua sponte dismissals of in forma pauperis\n\ncomplaints are authorized only where \"the court determines that\n\n. . . the action . . . (i) is frivolous or malicious; (ii) fails to\n\nstate a claim on which relief may be granted; or (iii) seeks\n\nmonetary relief   against   a   defendant   who   is   immune   from   such\n\nrelief.\"   28 U.S.C. 1915(e)(2)(B).     None of those determinations\n\nwas made here, nor does it appear that any such determinations\n\nwould have been warranted on the face of the complaint.                 See\n\nFredyma v. A T & T Network Sys., Inc., 935 F.2d 368, 368 (1st Cir.\n\n1991) (per curiam) (explaining that, under § 1915(e), \"a sua sponte\n\ndismissal without notice . . . is appropriate only if a claim is\n\npremised upon 'an indisputably meritless legal theory' or 'factual\n\nallegations [that] are clearly baseless.'\") (citing Neitzke v.\n\nWilliams, 490 U.S. 319, 325, 327 (1989)).\n\n     Accordingly, the judgment of dismissal is vacated and the case\n\nis remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
