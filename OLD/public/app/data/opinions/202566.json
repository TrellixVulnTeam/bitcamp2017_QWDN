R. 32.1.0\n\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                        For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 05-2752\n\n                      UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                                 Appellee,\n\n                                      v.\n\n                        DENSIL TREVOR CHAPMAN,\n\n                         Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n\n       [Hon. Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n              Cyr and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Maria Soledad Ramirez-Becerra and Maria Soledad Ramirez-\nBecerra Law Office on brief for appellant.\n     Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, Nelson\nPérez-Sosa and Germán A. Rieckehoff, Assistant United States\nAttorneys, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           December 22, 2006\n\f          Per Curiam. A federal grand jury sitting in the District\n\nof Puerto Rico indicted defendant-appellant Densil Trevor Chapman\n\non a single count charging that he, being an alien previously\n\ndeported from the United States subsequent to a conviction for an\n\naggravated felony, attempted to reenter without having obtained\n\nexpress consent from the Attorney General.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1326.\n\nThe defendant moved for relief from the indictment on the ground\n\nthat his original deportation was carried out in violation of his\n\ndue process rights.   The district court, accepting the recommended\n\ndecision of a magistrate judge, denied the motion.\n\n          Subsequently, the defendant entered an unconditional\n\nguilty plea to the single count of the indictment. The presentence\n\ninvestigation report (PSI Report) suggested a guideline sentencing\n\nrange (GSR) of 70-87 months.   The defendant did not object to this\n\ncalculation.\n\n          At the disposition hearing, held on October 18, 2005, the\n\ndefendant argued that imposing a sentence within the GSR would be\n\nharsher punishment than necessary.     In this regard, he cited a\n\nplethora of factors, such as his family history and background, his\n\nprior military service, the relatively compressed span of his\n\nprevious criminal activity, his belief that he would be deported\n\nupon his release from immurement (thereby blunting any need to\n\nincarcerate him for a lengthy period), and the fact that he\n\npresented no danger to society. After listening to the defendant's\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fimportunings,     the   district    court   accepted     the    PSI    Report's\n\nguideline    calculations     and    sentenced     him    to     a     40-month\n\nincarcerative term.     This timely appeal followed.\n\n            We need not tarry. The Supreme Court's landmark decision\n\nin United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 245 (2005), rendered the\n\nfederal sentencing guidelines advisory.           Post-Booker, we review\n\nsentences for reasonableness. Id. at 261. That standard of review\n\nobtains whether the sentence imposed falls inside or outside the\n\nGSR.   See United States v. Turbides-Leonardo, ___ F.3d ___, ___\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) [No. 05-2374, slip op. at 12-13]; United States v.\n\nJiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 517 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).\n\n            \"In constructing a sentence under an advisory guidelines\n\nregime, a sentencing court ordinarily should begin by calculating\n\nthe applicable guideline sentencing range; then determine whether\n\nor   not   any   departures   are   in   order;   then   mull    the    factors\n\ndelineated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) as well as any other relevant\n\nconsiderations; and, finally, determine what sentence, whether\n\nwithin, above, or below the guideline sentencing range, appears\n\nappropriate.\"     United States v. Pelletier, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st\n\nCir. 2006) [No. 06-1287, slip op. at 20].              Here, the defendant\n\nconcedes the correctness of the calculated GSR (70-87 months). See\n\nAppellant's Br. at 11.        By like token, he advances no argument\n\nanent the sentencing court's eschewal of a departure.                He posits,\n\nrather, that the sentencing court failed to attach appropriate\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fweight either to the various mitigating factors enumerated above or\n\nto irregularities in his original deportation proceeding.\n\n            This argument is meritless.                        The transcript of the\n\ndisposition hearing makes manifest that the lower court considered\n\nthe factors limned in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), mulled the various\n\nproffers    made       by    the   defendant         in     mitigation,     and     gave     the\n\ndefendant       a    huge    discount      —     sentencing       him      to   a    term     of\n\nimprisonment of 40 months.               That sentence is roughly 43% below the\n\nnadir of the applicable GSR.\n\n            The sentencing transcript and the PSI Report make the\n\ndistrict    court's         rationale      for       the     length   of    the      sentence\n\nabundantly clear.           That rationale is \"plausible.\"                 Jiménez-Beltre,\n\n440 F.3d at 519.              The resulting sentence is not unreasonably\n\nharsh.1    No more is exigible.\n\n            There are two final points.                      First, the fact that the\n\nsentencing court did not address the section 3553(a) factors one by\n\none in explicating its sentencing decision in no way undermines the\n\nreasonableness of the sentence imposed.                         See United States v.\n\nDixon,    449       F.3d    194,   205   (1st        Cir.    2006);   United        States    v.\n\nScherrer, 444 F.3d 91, 94 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).\n\n            Second, the defendant devotes much of his brief to the\n\nthesis that the district court should have extended him even\n\n\n\n     1\n      As the government has not cross-appealed, we                                  need     not\nconsider whether the sentence is unreasonably lenient.\n\n                                               -4-\n\fgreater largesse because of the dubious constitutionality of his\n\nearlier deportation proceeding.       This contention is waived: the\n\ntranscript of the disposition hearing discloses that, instead of\n\nasking the district court to consider his collateral attack on the\n\nconstitutionality   of   the   original   deportation   proceeding,   the\n\ndefendant told the court, through counsel, that he would not press\n\nthat argument but, rather, would \"throw [himself] on the mercy of\n\nthe Court.\"     That was a waiver, pure and simple.2         See United\n\nStates v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002).        Unlike a\n\nforfeited issue (which can be reviewed on appeal for plain error),\n\na waived issue cannot be reviewed at all.       See id.\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe uphold the sentence.        Our ruling is without prejudice, of\n\ncourse, to the defendant's right, if he so elects, to raise an\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      We do not disparage the substance of this claim. Were it not\nfor the combination of three events — this waiver, the\nunconditional guilty plea that preceded it, and the defendant's\nfailure to press an appeal of the original removal order to the\nBoard of Immigration Appeals — the result might well have been\ndifferent.\n\n                                   -5-\n\f",
