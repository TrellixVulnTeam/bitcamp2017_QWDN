Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                          Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                 Selya and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     John S. Campbell with whom Campbell & Associates, P.A. was on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Patrick J. Mellor with whom Perkins Olson, P.A. was on brief\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                              March 8, 2005\n\f             Per Curiam.   In April 2003, Margaret Siciliani brought\n\nsuit against Raymond Popsie and his employer, claiming that Popsie\n\nhad made sexual advances and assaulted her in his office on\n\nSeptember 13, 2002.        In April 2004, after a two-day trial in\n\nMaine's federal district court, a jury returned a verdict for\n\nSiciliani on her assault and battery claim, awarding her $23,796 in\n\ncompensatory damages--later reduced to $5,796 plus costs to account\n\nfor a settlement with Popsie's employer–but no punitive damages.\n\n             Popsie appeals, claiming that the evidence established\n\n\"no rational connection\" between the assault and Siciliani's loss\n\nof    employment;   that   the   district   court   erroneously   excluded\n\ntestimony about the events leading to Siciliani's termination from\n\nher    job   following   the   assault;   and   that   one   juror's   prior\n\nexperience with assault was ill-addressed by the district court and\n\ntainted the jury verdict.        Popsie argues that these errors--alone\n\nor in combination--merit judgment as a matter of law on Siciliani's\n\nclaim for lost wages and a new trial on her remaining claims.\n\n             Popsie has forfeited his challenge to the connection\n\nbetween Siciliani's assault and her subsequent loss of employment.\n\nPopsie's trial counsel moved for a directed verdict at the close of\n\nSiciliani's case based on the indeterminate amount of her lost\n\nwages, but made no mention of the theory now advanced on appeal--\n\nnamely, that the connection between Siciliani's assault and her\n\nsubsequent loss of employment was insufficiently proven.                The\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fmotion was renewed neither at the close of the evidence nor after\n\nthe jury's verdict.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50.\n\n              The situation presented here is not the rare \"miscarriage\n\nof justice\" that would induce us to address a claim otherwise\n\nforfeited in the district court.              Correa v. Hosp. S.F., 69 F.3d\n\n1184, 1196 (1st Cir. 1995).        Siciliani produced ample evidence of\n\nboth her assault and the effect of the assault on her subsequent\n\njob performance, as well as sufficient testimony to document the\n\neffect of her job loss on future income.              The resulting damages\n\naward was moderate.      The mere fact that the jury might have based\n\nthat award on future lost wages that were more tenuously supported-\n\n-a possibility that Popsie suggests but cannot prove due to the\n\njury's general verdict1--does not, without more, provide sufficient\n\nreason to address Popsie's claim of error when it was not raised\n\nbelow.\n\n              Popsie's challenge to the alleged restrictions placed on\n\ndefense testimony meets a similar fate.                He complains of the\n\ndistrict court's unwillingness to permit evidence of Siciliani's\n\ndifficulties at work after September 13, 2002.            In particular, he\n\npoints   to    four   objections   to    Popsie's    direct   examination   of\n\nSiciliani's human resources manager, three of which were sustained\n\n\n\n     1\n      The general verdict prevents Popsie from showing what part if\nany of the jury's award was for future (as opposed to past) lost\nincome, and also prevents him from ascertaining whether a portion\nor all of the award was for Siciliani's emotional distress.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fby the court and the fourth of which prompted defense counsel to\n\nrephrase.\n\n              Whether much can be made of these objections in the first\n\nplace is unclear (at least two can be read simply as requests for\n\nclarification), but in any event Popsie's counsel failed to make an\n\noffer of proof as to the testimony allegedly excluded and our\n\nreview is thus for plain error.        See Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)(2); see\n\nalso O'Rourke v. City of Providence, 235 F.3d 713, 735 (1st Cir.\n\n2001). Again, we see no miscarriage of justice sufficient to merit\n\ndisturbing the trial court's ruling.\n\n              Popsie's complaint of juror taint also fails.         During\n\nvoir dire, potential jurors were asked whether they or someone\n\nclose to them had ever had an experience involving assault or\n\nsexual assault.     During deliberations, the jury suggested that one\n\njuror should speak with the district judge regarding possible prior\n\nexperiences.      The judge conducted an inquiry in the presence of\n\nboth lawyers; the juror stated that \"perception is everything,\"\n\nbut further said that she believed she had answered the voir dire\n\nquestion properly and that neither she nor any of her immediate\n\nfamily members or friends had been involved in an assault or sexual\n\nassault of the type alleged by Siciliani.         Asked whether she felt\n\nshe   could    deliberate   fairly   and   impartially,   her   unequivocal\n\nresponse was \"absolutely.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f           We see no error whatever.   The district judge conducted\n\nan inquiry to respond to the possibility that the juror had\n\ninaccurately answered a question on voir dire or might be biased.\n\nThe juror's responses gave no cause for further concern.     Popsie\n\npresents no evidence that the juror had answered the voir dire\n\nquestions inaccurately.   The court was under no obligation to go\n\nfurther.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
