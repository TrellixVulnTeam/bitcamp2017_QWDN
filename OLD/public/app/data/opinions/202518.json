We    have\n\njurisdiction to review this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1292.      Because the district court subsequently dismissed\n\nDefendants’        counterclaim      due    to    discovery      violations,         we\n\ndismiss Defendants’ interlocutory appeal as moot.\n\n                                       I.\n\n             Plaintiff      Freightliner          manufactures       and          sells\n\ntrucks worldwide.          In 1996, Plaintiff and Defendant Puerto\n\nRico Truck Sales, Inc., executed an agreement (“Agreement”)\n\nfor   the    distribution      of    Freightliner        products       in    Puerto\n\nRico.       Defendant      Freightliner          Truck   Sales    and    Services\n\n(“FTSS”) later assumed Puerto Rico Truck Sales position in\n\nthe Agreement.\n\n             On    September   10,    2004,       Plaintiff      terminated         the\n\nAgreement with FTSS and on September 13, 2004, it filed a\n\ncomplaint against Defendants for damages and collection of\n\nmonies.      Plaintiff based its termination of the Agreement on\n\nFTSS’s      alleged     lack   of    payment       of    substantial         overdue\n\namounts and FTSS’s alleged illegal or wrongful shipment and\n\nimportation of 18 Freightliner trucks into Puerto Rico.                              In\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\faddition to damages, Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment\n\non the validity of its termination of the Agreement.\n\n            Defendants        counterclaimed              seeking             damages     and\n\nalleging Plaintiff’s cancellation of the Agreement violated\n\ntheir rights under Puerto Rico Law 75, P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n10, § 278 (“Law 75”), a statute prohibiting a principal from\n\nterminating without just cause a distribution agreement with\n\nits   dealer.        In    connection        with    their          counterclaim          and\n\npursuant    to     Law     75,     Defendants        filed          a    motion       for    a\n\ntemporary       restraining        order    (“TRO”)           and   a     motion      for    a\n\npreliminary       injunction.          Defendants             requested         the     court\n\ndissolve    Plaintiff’s           cancellation           of    the       Agreement        and\n\nenjoin Plaintiff from entering into a distribution agreement\n\nwith another Puerto Rican distributor. The district court\n\ndenied    the    motion      for    TRO     and    referred             the    motion     for\n\npreliminary injunction to the magistrate judge for a report\n\nand   recommendation         (R&R).        After     a    lengthy         hearing,        the\n\nmagistrate       judge      issued    a     R&R     recommending                denial      of\n\nDefendants’ motion for preliminary injunction, concluding\n\nDefendants       failed      to     establish        the        prerequisites             for\n\npreliminary injunctive relief under Law 75.\n\n            Defendants        timely       objected           to    the        R&R.       The\n\ndistrict court overruled the objections and adopted the R&R.\n\nIn    a   separate        order,     the     court       dismissed             Defendants’\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fcounterclaims with prejudice due to discovery violations,\n\nand entered a partial judgment as to those claims.                              See Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(C).               Defendants sought certification to\n\nappeal    the    district       court’s      partial       judgment      pursuant          to\n\nFed.     R.    Civ.    P.      54(b).            The     district       court       denied\n\nDefendants’ request, finding the partial judgment did not\n\nmeet the criteria for immediate appealability set forth in\n\nSpiegel v. The Trustees of Tufts College, 843 F.2d 38, 43\n\n(1st   Cir.     1988).         Defendants         filed     a    notice       of    appeal\n\nseeking       review   of   the      district          court’s       denial    of    their\n\nmotion for preliminary injunction and the court’s dismissal\n\nof their counterclaims.\n\n                                            II.\n\n              Plaintiff argues Defendants’ appeal is moot because\n\nthe    district        court     dismissed             Defendants’       counterclaim\n\npursuant to Law 75.             We agree.          Defendants’ request for a\n\npreliminary       injunction         was     specifically            grounded       in    its\n\ncounterclaim       pursuant          to    Law    75.       Because       Defendants’\n\ncounterclaim no longer exists, they would have no recourse\n\nin the district court even if we reverse its denial of their\n\nmotion    for     preliminary             injunction.           Chaparro-Febus             v.\n\nInternational         Longshoremen’s          Ass’n,      Local       1575,    983       F.2d\n\n325,     331     n.5     (1st        Cir.     1992)       (noting        “preliminary\n\ninjunctions,       which       are    interlocutory             in    nature,       cannot\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fsurvive a final order of dismissal”).                       Thus, Defendants’\n\nappeal of the district court’s denial of their motion for\n\npreliminary injunction is moot.                 Id.   (“Because the district\n\ncourt’s denial of the preliminary injunction was merged in\n\nthe   final       judgment       dismissing        the      case,    plaintiffs’\n\ncomplaints regarding the preliminary injunction are moot.”)\n\n(citations and quotations omitted).\n\n            In    their    reply    brief,       Defendants        maintain       this\n\ncourt can entertain their interlocutory appeal because the\n\nnotice    of     appeal    seeks    review       of   the    district          court’s\n\npartial judgment disposing of their counterclaim.                          We find\n\nDefendants       waived    any   arguments       related      to    the    district\n\ncourt’s        dismissal     of      their        counterclaim            in      this\n\ninterlocutory appeal.            “[W]e have steadfastly deemed waived\n\nissues    raised     on    appeal    in     a    perfunctory        manner,        not\n\naccompanied by developed argumentation.”                    Massachusetts Sch.\n\nof Law v.

Defendants make no mention of the issue in their\n\nopening brief and only briefly address the issue in their\n\nreply brief without explaining how the district court erred\n\nin dismissing their counterclaim or in denying their motion\n\nfor a Rule 54(b) certificate of appealability.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f                                  III.\n\n          Based   upon    the     foregoing,   Defendants’    appeal,\n\nDefendants’   Motion     to     Supplement   the   Record   with   New\n\nEvidence, and Plaintiff’s Motion to Strike are DISMISSED as\n\nmoot.

Thus, Defendants’\n\nappeal of the district court’s denial of their motion for\n\npreliminary injunction is moot.                 Id.   (“Because the district\n\ncourt’s denial of the preliminary injunction was merged in\n\nthe   final       judgment       dismissing        the      case,    plaintiffs’\n\ncomplaints regarding the preliminary injunction are moot.”)\n\n(citations and quotations omitted).\n\n            In    their    reply    brief,       Defendants        maintain       this\n\ncourt can entertain their interlocutory appeal because the\n\nnotice    of     appeal    seeks    review       of   the    district          court’s\n\npartial judgment disposing of their counterclaim.                          We find\n\nDefendants       waived    any   arguments       related      to    the    district\n\ncourt’s        dismissal     of      their        counterclaim            in      this\n\ninterlocutory appeal.            “[W]e have steadfastly deemed waived\n\nissues    raised     on    appeal    in     a    perfunctory        manner,        not\n\naccompanied by developed argumentation.”                    Massachusetts Sch.\n\nof Law v.

Defendants make no mention of the issue in their\n\nopening brief and only briefly address the issue in their\n\nreply brief without explaining how the district court erred\n\nin dismissing their counterclaim or in denying their motion\n\nfor a Rule 54(b) certificate of appealability.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f                                  III.\n\n          Based   upon    the     foregoing,   Defendants’    appeal,\n\nDefendants’   Motion     to     Supplement   the   Record   with   New\n\nEvidence, and Plaintiff’s Motion to Strike are DISMISSED as\n\nmoot.   We make no comment as to the remaining matters before\n\nthe district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f</pre>",
