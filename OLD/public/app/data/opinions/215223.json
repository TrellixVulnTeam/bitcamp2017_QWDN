Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme\nCourt of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f            SELYA,    Circuit      Judge.          A       town   council        refused      to\n\nreappoint the plaintiff to an unpaid advisory commission after he\n\npublicly    criticized     certain       of   the          council's     policies.           The\n\nplaintiff sued, but the district court jettisoned his case at the\n\nsummary judgment stage. Foote v. Town of Bedford, No. 1:09-cv-171,\n\n2010 WL 3238315 (D.N.H. Aug. 13, 2010).                         The plaintiff's appeal\n\npresents a nuanced First Amendment question about the relationship\n\nbetween    policymakers      and   policy-related               speech      in   the   public\n\nsector.    After careful consideration, we conclude that the refused\n\nreappointment,      though    premised        on       a    lawful     exercise        of    the\n\nplaintiff's right to free speech, did not transgress the First\n\nAmendment.    Consequently, we affirm the judgment below.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            We draw the facts from the summary judgment record and\n\nrehearse them in the light most favorable to the nonmovant (here,\n\nthe plaintiff).      Galloza v. Foy, 389 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            The organic governing document of Bedford, New Hampshire\n\n(the Town), is the town charter, which vests primary responsibility\n\nfor the administration of municipal affairs in a seven-member town\n\ncouncil    (the   Council).        The    charter           imbues   the     Council        with\n\nauthority    to    appoint     the   members               of   municipal        boards      and\n\ncommissions,      including    the   Bedford           Recreation        Commission         (the\n\nCommission).         The     Commission's          bailiwick           is    to     propound\n\nrecommendations to the Council and the Town Manager about \"the\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\facquisition, holding, and disposition\" of recreational facilities,\n\nthe staffing of those facilities, and the \"rules and regulations\"\n\nfor their operation.            Bedford, N.H., Charter art. 1-11-1(c)(2).\n\n             The Commission holds regular meetings that are open to\n\nthe public.       It is composed of five members, all of whom serve\n\nwithout compensation. They are appointed by the Council, typically\n\nfor staggered three-year terms (although some appointments are for\n\nshorter periods, say, if a commissioner dies or resigns mid-term).\n\n             On   May     11,    2005,     the   Council   appointed   plaintiff-\n\nappellant William Foote to fill a vacancy in the Commission's\n\nranks.     Upon completing the unexpired portion of that term, he was\n\nreappointed for three years.              For aught that appears, his service\n\nwas exemplary.\n\n             In January of 2009, the plaintiff received a letter\n\nreminding him that his term would expire in March and inquiring\n\nabout whether he wished to continue. The letter made pellucid that\n\nreappointment would be in the Council's sole discretion.                       The\n\nplaintiff replied that he would be pleased to return to the\n\nCommission.\n\n             On   March    6,     the    plaintiff   attended   a   meeting   of   a\n\ncommittee formed to assist in developing a community park project\n\ndenominated as Bedford Village Common (BVC).                  At the meeting, he\n\nvoiced opposition to the Council's plan to revise certain aspects\n\nof   the   proposed     project      and    (over    the   Council's   objections)\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fadvocated the use of impact fees as a funding mechanism to assure\n\nfinancial viability.            In a particularly pointed exchange, he\n\naccused the Council of \"trying to kill the project with a thousand\n\npaper cuts.\"\n\n            A    municipal     election   took   place   on   March   10.    The\n\nplaintiff lost a bid for a seat on the school board.             In defeat, he\n\nwarned that he would be watching how the school board handled its\n\nbudget.\n\n            With the election in his rear-view mirror, the plaintiff\n\ncontinued       to   press    his   candidacy    for   reappointment    to   the\n\nCommission.          To that end, he met with members of the newly\n\nconstituted Council.          At a meeting held on March 16, the Council,\n\nvoting four to three, proposed filling the two vacancies on the\n\nCommission with other aspirants.              In a later vote, the Council\n\nnamed those aspirants to the Commission.\n\n            Asserting that his vocal criticism in connection with the\n\nBVC project led to this rebuff, the plaintiff sued the Town and\n\nfour councillors who had voted to deny him reappointment (William\n\nDermody, Michael Izbicki, Paul F. Roy, Sr., and Robert Young).                He\n\nbrought his suit in a New Hampshire state court, alleging a First\n\nAmendment claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and three supplemental\n\nstate-law claims.            The defendants removed the case to federal\n\ndistrict court, see 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441(b), 1446, and in due\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fseason sought summary judgment, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.                        The\n\nplaintiff opposed summary judgment.\n\n              The    district   court    entered   summary     judgment   on   the\n\nsection 1983 claim and remanded the remaining claims to state\n\ncourt.   Foote, 2010 WL 3238315, at *4-5.                It reasoned that the\n\ndefendants' \"strong interest\" in appointing like-minded people to\n\nthe Commission outweighed the plaintiff's First Amendment rights.\n\nId. at *4.      This timely appeal followed.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n              We divide our substantive discussion into four segments.\n\n                           A.    Standard of Review.\n\n              We review the entry of summary judgment de novo. Houlton\n\nCitizens' Coal. v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir.\n\n1999). In performing this tamisage, we scrutinize the facts in the\n\nlight most agreeable to the nonmovant, ceding all reasonable\n\ninferences therefrom in his favor.             Cox v. Hainey, 391 F.3d 25, 29\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).         Summary judgment is appropriate only if the\n\nrecord, viewed in the required light, reveals no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact and demonstrates that the movant is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.            Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.      Withal, we are\n\nnot married to the trial court's rationale but may uphold its\n\nruling   on    any    ground    made   manifest    by   the   record.     Houlton\n\nCitizens' Coal., 175 F.3d at 184; Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895\n\nF.2d 46, 48-49 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f                     B.   The Decisional Framework.\n\n            The plaintiff's case stands or falls on his claim that\n\nthe individual defendants impermissibly refused to reappoint him to\n\nthe Commission because of his public opposition to, and criticism\n\nof, certain municipal policies. For summary judgment purposes, the\n\ndistrict court assumed that this reason underpinned his failed bid\n\nfor reappointment, and so do we.           This assumption is important\n\nbecause \"the First Amendment protects a public employee's right, in\n\ncertain circumstances, to speak as a citizen addressing matters of\n\npublic concern.\"1    Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 417 (2006).\n\nAs this case illustrates, that right is not absolute.\n\n            When speech by a public employee is involved, courts\n\ntypically choreograph a three-step chaconne.        The first step is to\n\ndetermine whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of\n\npublic concern.     Id. at 415-16.    The second step is to balance the\n\nemployee's First Amendment interests against the interests of the\n\ngovernment, as an employer, in providing effective and efficient\n\nservices.   Waters v. Churchill, 511 U.S. 661, 668 (1994).       At the\n\nthird and final step, the employee must \"show that the protected\n\nexpression was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Of course, the plaintiff was an unpaid member of an advisory\nboard rather than a full-fledged employee, and he was denied\nreappointment rather than discharged.    We explain infra why we\nnonetheless consider the dismissed-employee analogy apt.\n\n                                     -6-\n\femployment decision.\" Curran v. Cousins, 509 F.3d 36, 45 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n          For present purposes, the defendants do not dispute that\n\nthe plaintiff spoke out as a citizen and that his public commentary\n\nrelated to matters of community concern. Thus, his speech triggers\n\nFirst Amendment analysis.    See Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 146\n\n(1983).   The third step here is a foregone conclusion; we already\n\nhave noted our assumption that the commentary was a substantial\n\ncause of the Council's refusal to reappoint the plaintiff to a new\n\nterm on the Commission.     It necessarily follows that this appeal\n\nhinges on the second step in the chaconne: the \"balance between the\n\ninterests of the [plaintiff], as a citizen, in commenting upon\n\nmatters of public concern and the interest of the [government], as\n\nan employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it\n\nperforms through its employees.\"       Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391\n\nU.S. 563, 568 (1968).\n\n          The Pickering balancing test is heavily dependent on\n\ncontext, and the Supreme Court has established a corollary to this\n\ntest with respect to policymaking employees.      The seminal case is\n\nElrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976), in which the Court held that\n\na government employer cannot discharge an employee merely because\n\nhe is not affiliated with a particular political party.    Id. at 373\n\n(plurality op.).   But the Court noted an exception: a government\n\nemployer can terminate a policymaking employee based on party\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\faffiliation.      Id. at 367.      \"This exception helps to ensure that\n\nelected representatives will not be hamstrung in endeavoring to\n\ncarry out the voters' mandate.\"         Galloza, 389 F.3d at 28.\n\n              The Court later broadened the exception to include any\n\nemployee for whom \"party affiliation is an appropriate requirement\n\nfor the effective performance of the public office involved.\"\n\nBranti   v.    Finkel,   445   U.S.   507,   518      (1980).     Thus,   when     a\n\ngovernment employer takes an adverse employment action against such\n\na    policymaking     employee     based     on       the   latter's    political\n\naffiliation,     it   has    \"demonstrate[d]      a    compelling    interest      in\n\ninfringing First Amendment rights.\" Rutan v. Repub. Party of Ill.,\n\n497 U.S. 62, 71 n.5 (1990).\n\n              The Supreme Court has not squarely addressed the question\n\nof   whether,    or   how,   the   Elrod/Branti       exception     applies   to   a\n\npolicymaking employee's First Amendment claim premised on speech\n\nrather than political affiliation.                Nevertheless, a number of\n\ncourts of appeals have concluded that the principles undergirding\n\nthe Elrod/Branti exception provide roughly comparable shelter for\n\na government employer where a policymaker is cashiered for policy-\n\nrelated speech.       See, e.g., Rose v. Stephens, 291 F.3d 917, 921\n\n(6th Cir. 2002); Warzon v. Drew, 60 F.3d 1234, 1238 (7th Cir.\n\n1995); Hall v. Ford, 856 F.2d 255, 263 (D.C. Cir. 1988).                      These\n\ncourts sensibly \"recognize[] the inherent inconsistency in a rule\n\nthat protects a policymaking employee who overtly expresses his\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fdisloyalty while denying that same protection to one who merely\n\nbelongs to a different political party.\"       Rose, 291 F.3d at 922;\n\naccord Vargas-Harrison v. Racine Unified Sch. Dist., 272 F.3d 964,\n\n971-72 (7th Cir. 2001).     Although acknowledging that the Pickering\n\nbalance must still be struck, these courts employ Elrod/Branti\n\nprinciples to inform that exercise.      See Vargas-Harrison, 272 F.3d\n\nat   971.     In   public   employee/public   speech   cases   involving\n\npolicymakers, those principles ordinarily will tip the balance in\n\nfavor of the government as a matter of law.2     See Rose, 291 F.3d at\n\n922; Vargas-Harrison, 272 F.3d at 971.\n\n            The key precedent in this circuit fits tongue and groove\n\nwith this case law.    See Flynn v. City of Boston, 140 F.3d 42, 47\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).       That decision involved a challenge to the\n\ndismissal of two policymaking employees on both free speech and\n\nfree association grounds.     In ruling for the employer, we wrote:\n\n            it is a reasonable working rule that, where\n            the employee is subject to discharge for\n            political reasons under the Elrod and Branti\n            cases, a superior may also — without offending\n            the First Amendment's free speech guarantee —\n            consider the official's substantive views on\n            agency matters in deciding whether to retain\n            the official in a policy related position.\n\n\n      2\n        One circuit has gone even further, ruling that the\nElrod/Branti exception for policymakers replaces Pickering in\npolicymaker cases involving policy-related speech. See Fazio v.\nCity and Cnty. of San Francisco, 125 F.3d 1328, 1332 (9th Cir.\n1997). Under that view, a determination that the employee is a\npolicymaker \"dispos[es] of any First Amendment retaliation claim.\"\nBiggs v. Best, Best & Krieger, 189 F.3d 989, 994-95 (9th Cir.\n1999). We hesitate to go so far.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fId.   \"Precisely because [the plaintiffs'] speech did bear on the\n\njob and on their working relationship,\" the employer \"was permitted\n\nto conclude reasonably that she did not have the necessary trust\n\nand confidence to retain them.\"              Id. (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            We think that this approach follows logically from the\n\nSupreme Court's repeated admonition in the political affiliation\n\ncases that the government must be allowed to accomplish its policy\n\nobjectives through loyal, cooperative deputies whom the public will\n\nperceive as sharing the administration's goals.                    See Rutan, 497\n\nU.S. at 74; Rankin v. McPherson, 483 U.S. 378, 388 (1987).                     In the\n\npolitical   affiliation     cases,    the     Court    made    a    \"[c]ategorical\n\njudgment[] based on experience and common sense\" that an \"elected\n\nofficial is entitled to insist on the loyalty of his policymaking\n\nsubordinates.\"    Wilbur v. Mahan, 3 F.3d 214, 218 (7th Cir. 1993).\n\nThe same commonsense tenets are in play when a policymaker, by\n\nespousing     contrary    views,     openly    undermines          the   appointing\n\nauthority's    interest    in   ensuring      that    its     policies     will   be\n\nimplemented.        See     Vargas-Harrison,           272     F.3d       at    971.\n\n\"[D]isagreement between the employer and the policymaking employee\n\nover job-related policy issues causes the same failure of loyalty\n\nand shared political mission between superior and subordinate as\n\ninconsistent    political    affiliation       or     viewpoint.\"         Bonds   v.\n\nMilwaukee Cnty., 207 F.3d 969, 978 (7th Cir. 2000).\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f               We add that transplantation of Elrod/Branti principles to\n\nspeech cases is consistent with Pickering's goal of balancing the\n\ngovernment's interest in effective governance with the employee's\n\nright to speak out on matters of public concern.            See Pickering,\n\n391 U.S. at 568. The Pickering Court recognized the \"significantly\n\ndifferent considerations\" that attend the dismissal of an employee\n\nin circumstances in which loyalty is essential.            Id. at 570 n.3;\n\nsee Rankin, 483 U.S. at 388.        In a case involving policy-related\n\nspeech, like this one, those considerations ought to weigh heavily\n\nin the Pickering balance.3\n\n               What we have said to this point dictates the decisional\n\nframework that applies here.       The Elrod/Branti line of cases must\n\ninform the Pickering balance whenever a policymaking employee is\n\ndismissed for speech elucidating his views on job-related public\n\npolicy.\n\n                    C.   Distinguishing Characteristics.\n\n               Thus far, our analysis has focused on the First Amendment\n\nrights    of    policymakers   ousted   from   public   employment   due   to\n\n\n\n     3\n       We recognize that some courts have thus far confined the\napplication of Elrod and Branti to cases involving political\naffiliation. See, e.g., Hinshaw v. Smith, 436 F.3d 997, 1006 (8th\nCir. 2006); Curinga v. City of Clairton, 357 F.3d 305, 314 (3d Cir.\n2004); Lewis v. Cowen, 165 F.3d 154, 162 (2d Cir. 1999). But the\ndistinction, if one exists, is a matter of degree; those courts\nfreely acknowledge that when the affected employee holds a\npolicymaking position, the government's interest weighs quite\nheavily in the Pickering balance. See Hinshaw, 436 F.3d at 1007;\nMcEvoy v. Spencer, 124 F.3d 92, 103 (2d Cir. 1997).\n\n                                    -11-\n\fpolitical affiliation and/or speech.            The plaintiff does not fit\n\nthat mold precisely.         For one thing, he was not a government\n\nemployee but, rather, a volunteer.           For another thing, he was not\n\nfired but, rather, denied reappointment.               In the circumstances of\n\nthis case, however, neither of those distinctions inhibits the\n\napplicability of either Pickering or Elrod/Branti principles.                   We\n\nexplain briefly.\n\n            Although some courts have ruled that volunteers hold\n\ntheir unpaid government positions in the unfettered discretion of\n\nthe appointing authority, see, e.g., Griffith v. Lanier, 521 F.3d\n\n398, 404 (D.C. Cir. 2008); Versarge v. Twp. of Clinton, 984 F.2d\n\n1359, 1370 (3d Cir. 1993), we need not solve that riddle.                      For\n\npresent   purposes,    it    is   enough   to   say    that   the    government's\n\ninterest in ensuring that its policymakers sing from the same sheet\n\nmusic applies equally to policymakers who are hired hands and\n\npolicymakers who are unpaid advisors.\n\n            By like token, the fact that the plaintiff was denied\n\nreappointment, rather than dismissed, does not alter the relevant\n\ncalculus.    See Barton v. Clancy, 632 F.3d 9, 26 (1st Cir. 2011);\n\nWard v. Hickey, 996 F.2d 448, 452 (1st Cir. 1993).               Where, as here,\n\nthe adverse action involves the denial of an appointment to an\n\nunpaid    advisory    post    that   deals      with    policy      matters,   the\n\ngovernment's interest in effective and efficient operation is on a\n\npar with its interest when the action involves the removal of an\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\femployee from a paid policymaking position.                See Barton, 632 F.3d\n\nat 26.\n\n                                  D.   The Merits.\n\n            Having determined that the principles underpinning the\n\nElrod/Branti exception are transferable to public employee/public\n\nspeech cases, we turn to whether the position that the plaintiff\n\nsought was policymaking in nature and, if so, whether the speech\n\nthat prompted the denial of reappointment was policy related.                       See\n\nRose, 291 F.3d at 924; Warzon, 60 F.3d at 1239.                             These are\n\nquintessentially legal questions.               See Flynn, 140 F.3d at 44.\n\n            This    inquiry     is     both   position-specific           and   speech-\n\nspecific.     See Bonds, 207 F.3d at 977-78; see also Galloza, 389\n\nF.3d at 29.      First, we examine position-specific features starting\n\nwith a \"high-level glimpse\" at whether the particular position\n\ndeals with matters that are potentially subject to differences of\n\nopinion on policy grounds.               Galloza, 389 F.3d at 29.                   This\n\nassessment encompasses the extent to which the position has the\n\ncapacity to \"influence[] the resolution of such matters.\"                       Mendez-\n\nPalou v. Rohena-Betancourt, 813 F.2d 1255, 1258 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n            We    need    not   tarry.        The   Commission      is    obviously   a\n\npolicymaking      body.     Its      principal      function   is    to    advise   the\n\nCouncil, which is the Town's legislative and policymaking arm. See\n\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 49-B:2(IV)(d); Town of Hooksett v. Baines,\n\n813 A.2d 474, 475-76 (N.H. 2002).               State law and the town charter\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fconfer upon the Commission broad duties relating to the formulation\n\nand implementation of park policy and the responsibility to work\n\nwith     other    governmental      actors    to    coordinate     and    promote\n\nrecreational activities.         N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 35-B:3; Bedford,\n\nN.H., Charter art. 1-11-1(c).          The Commission's responsibilities\n\ncall for the exercise of discretionary judgment on matters of\n\nimportance to the Town and its inhabitants and involve policy\n\nissues on which there is room for disagreement as to both goals and\n\nmethods    of     implementation.       See   Jimenez      Fuentes   v.   Torres\n\nGaztambide, 807 F.2d 236, 241-42 (1st Cir. 1986) (en banc).                 That\n\nthese responsibilities are exercised subject to Council approval\n\ndoes not alter their fundamental character.\n\n            The second element of this position-specific assessment\n\nfocuses on whether the responsibilities of the position itself\n\n\"sufficiently resemble those of a policymaker.\"              Galloza, 389 F.3d\n\nat 29.    An important datum is whether the ability to do the work\n\neffectively will be enhanced by the appointment of persons who hold\n\nparticular policy views.            An office-holder who is principally\n\ninvolved with policy, \"even if only as an adviser,\" qualifies as a\n\npolicymaker.       Flynn, 140 F.3d at 46.\n\n            The     position   in    question      fits   neatly   within   this\n\nparadigm.        Although there is no formal job description for the\n\nposition, the Commission's raison d'être involves policymaking, and\n\nmembers of the Commission are the instruments for carrying out that\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fmission.   Individual Commission members work directly with elected\n\nofficials and have a considerable capacity to influence municipal\n\ndecisions affecting parks and recreation.            They are, therefore,\n\npolicymakers.    See Vargas-Harrison, 272 F.3d at 971; Ortiz-Piñero\n\nv. Rivera-Arroyo, 84 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n           The plaintiff suggests that because the position is\n\nmerely advisory, it cannot involve policymaking.          This suggestion\n\nsets up a false dichotomy.    A person need not possess the ultimate\n\ndecisionmaking authority in order to qualify as a policymaker.\n\nAdvisors can be policymakers.       See Elrod, 427 U.S. at 368; Flynn,\n\n140 F.3d at 46.\n\n           The last piece of the puzzle is speech-specific.        We ask\n\nwhether the speech in question fairly can be said to conflict with\n\nthe appointing authority's stated policies on matters related to\n\nthe Commission's work. See Rose, 291 F.3d at 924; Vargas-Harrison,\n\n272 F.3d at 973.    This aspect of the matter is open and shut.\n\n           In the weeks before the Council took the challenged\n\naction,    the   plaintiff   made    it    crystal   clear   (openly   and\n\nvociferously) that he disagreed with the Council's approach to the\n\nBVC project. In addition, he publicly opposed the Council's choice\n\nof a preferred funding mechanism for the project.         These views are\n\nplainly policy related and bear directly on matters that the\n\nCouncil reasonably could expect to fall within the purview of the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fCommission.       On the undisputed facts, the necessary link between\n\nthe speech and the position has been forged.4\n\n           In an effort to change the trajectory of the debate, the\n\nplaintiff argues that diversity of viewpoints among Commission\n\nmembers is beneficial to enlightened governance. That may be true,\n\nbut the choice is up to the Council.        The First Amendment does not\n\nrequire    that    an   appointing    authority     surround    itself   with\n\npolicymakers who represent divergent viewpoints.               See Wilbur, 3\n\nF.3d at 218; see also Connick, 461 U.S. at 146 (\"[G]overnment\n\nofficials should enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices,\n\nwithout intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the\n\nFirst Amendment.\").\n\n           In this case, all roads lead to Rome.                 A position-\n\nspecific assessment makes manifest that compatibility of views is\n\na reasonable requirement for appointment to the Commission.                 A\n\nspeech-specific assessment makes manifest that the plaintiff's\n\ncomments on matters within the purview of the Commission could\n\nreasonably have been seen by the defendants as demonstrating a lack\n\nof   the   desired      compatibility.      Under    these     circumstances,\n\n\n\n     4\n       The plaintiff also alleges that his animadversions against\nthe school board contributed to the refusal to reappoint him to the\nCommission. This allegation adds nothing to the equation. After\nall, the Council reasonably could have regarded those comments as\ninterfering with his ability to carry out one of the essential\nfunctions of the Commission: coordinating park policy with other\npublic officials.   See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 35-B:3; Bedford,\nN.H., Charter art. 1-11-1(c).\n\n                                     -16-\n\fElrod/Branti principles require a finding that the defendants'\n\ninterest     in        providing     effective        and    efficient    government\n\npreponderates over the plaintiff's First Amendment interest in free\n\nexpression of his views.           See O'Hare Truck Serv., Inc. v. City of\n\nNorthlake, 518 U.S. 712, 719 (1996); Bonds, 207 F.3d at 977.\n\nConsequently, the Pickering balance must be struck in favor of\n\npermitting       the    defendants     to    rely     on    the   plaintiff's   public\n\ncomments    as    a     reason   for   declining       to    reappoint   him    to   the\n\nCommission.       See Vargas-Harrison, 272 F.3d at 974.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.                 While the plaintiff was within\n\nhis rights to criticize the Council's vision of the BVC project,\n\nthe defendants were likewise within their rights in choosing not to\n\nreappoint a foe of their policies to serve on a board whose primary\n\nfunction was to give them policymaking advice.                    Thus, the district\n\ncourt did not err in rejecting the plaintiff's First Amendment\n\nclaim.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -17-\n\f",

The plaintiff sued, but the district court jettisoned his case at the summary judgment stage. <i>Foote v. Town of Bedford,</i> No. 1:09-cv-171, 2010 WL 3238315 (D.N.H. Aug. 13, 2010). The plaintiff's appeal presents a nuanced First Amendment question about the relationship between policymakers and policy-related speech in the public sector. After careful consideration, we conclude that the refused reappointment, though premised on a lawful exercise of the plaintiff's right to free speech, did not transgress the First Amendment. Consequently, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We draw the facts from the summary judgment record and rehearse them in the light most favorable to the nonmovant (here, the plaintiff). <i>Galloza v. Foy,</i> 389 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>The organic governing document of Bedford, New Hampshire (the Town), is the town charter, which vests primary responsibility for the administration of municipal affairs in a seven-member town council (the Council). The charter imbues the Council with authority to appoint the members of municipal boards and commissions, including the Bedford Recreation Commission (the Commission). The Commission's bailiwick is to propound recommendations to the Council and the Town Manager about \"the acquisition, holding, and disposition\" of recreational facilities, the staffing of those facilities, and the \"rules and regulations\" for their operation. Bedford, N.H., Charter art. 1-11-1(c)(2).</p>\n<p>The Commission holds regular meetings that are open to the public. It is composed of five members, all of whom serve without compensation. They are appointed by the Council, typically for staggered three-year terms (although some appointments are for shorter periods, say, if a commissioner dies or resigns mid-term).</p>\n<p>On May 11, 2005, the Council appointed plaintiff-appellant William Foote to fill a vacancy in the Commission's ranks. Upon completing the unexpired portion of that term, he was reappointed for three years. For aught that appears, his service was exemplary.</p>\n<p>In January of 2009, the plaintiff received a letter reminding him that his term would expire in March and inquiring about whether he wished to continue. The letter made pellucid that reappointment would be in the Council's sole discretion. The plaintiff replied that he would be pleased to return to the Commission.</p>\n<p>On March 6, the plaintiff attended a meeting of a committee formed to assist in developing a community park project denominated as Bedford Village Common (BVC). At the meeting, he voiced opposition to the Council's plan to revise certain aspects of the proposed project and (over the Council's objections) advocated the use of impact fees as a funding mechanism to assure financial viability. In a particularly pointed exchange, he accused the Council of \"trying to kill the project with a thousand paper cuts.\"</p>\n<p>A municipal election took place on March 10. The plaintiff lost a bid for a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> seat on the school board. In defeat, he warned that he would be watching how the school board handled its budget.</p>\n<p>With the election in his rear-view mirror, the plaintiff continued to press his candidacy for reappointment to the Commission. To that end, he met with members of the newly constituted Council. At a meeting held on March 16, the Council, voting four to three, proposed filling the two vacancies on the Commission with other aspirants. In a later vote, the Council named those aspirants to the Commission.</p>\n<p>Asserting that his vocal criticism in connection with the BVC project led to this rebuff, the plaintiff sued the Town and four councillors who had voted to deny him reappointment (William Dermody, Michael Izbicki, Paul F. Roy, Sr., and Robert Young). He brought his suit in a New Hampshire state court, alleging a First Amendment claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and three supplemental state-law claims. The defendants removed the case to federal district court, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441(b), 1446, and in due season sought summary judgment, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. The plaintiff opposed summary judgment.</p>\n<p>The district court entered summary judgment on the section 1983 claim and remanded the remaining claims to state court. <i>Foote,</i> 2010 WL 3238315, at *4-5. It reasoned that the defendants' \"strong interest\" in appointing like-minded people to the Commission outweighed the plaintiff's First Amendment rights. <i>Id.</i> at *4. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>We divide our substantive discussion into four segments.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Standard of Review.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review the entry of summary judgment de novo. <i>Houlton Citizens' Coal. v. Town of Houlton,</i> 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir.1999). In performing this tamisage, we scrutinize the facts in the light most agreeable to the nonmovant, ceding all reasonable inferences therefrom in his favor. <i>Cox v. Hainey,</i> 391 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir.2004). Summary judgment is appropriate only if the record, viewed in the required light, reveals no genuine issue of material fact and demonstrates that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. Withal, we are not married to the trial court's rationale but may uphold its ruling on any ground made manifest by the record. <i>Houlton Citizens' Coal.,</i> 175 F.3d at 184; <i>Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> 895 F.2d 46, 48-49 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Decisional Framework.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The plaintiff's case stands or falls on his claim that the individual defendants impermissibly refused to reappoint him to the Commission because of his public opposition to, and criticism of, certain municipal policies. For summary judgment purposes, the district court assumed that this reason underpinned his failed bid for reappointment, and so do we. This assumption is important because \"the First Amendment protects a public employee's right, in certain circumstances, to speak as a citizen addressing matters of public concern.\"<sup>[1]</sup><i>Garcetti v. Ceballos,</i> 547 U.S. 410, 417, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006). As this case illustrates, that right is not absolute.</p>\n<p>When speech by a public employee is involved, courts typically choreograph a three-step chaconne. The first step is to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> determine whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern. <i>Id.</i> at 415-16, 126 S.Ct. 1951. The second step is to balance the employee's First Amendment interests against the interests of the government, as an employer, in providing effective and efficient services. <i>Waters v. Churchill,</i> 511 U.S. 661, 668, 114 S.Ct. 1878, 128 L.Ed.2d 686 (1994). At the third and final step, the employee must \"show that the protected expression was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision.\" <i>Curran v. Cousins,</i> 509 F.3d 36, 45 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>For present purposes, the defendants do not dispute that the plaintiff spoke out as a citizen and that his public commentary related to matters of community concern. Thus, his speech triggers First Amendment analysis. <i>See </i><i>Connick v. Myers,</i> 461 U.S. 138, 146, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983). The third step here is a foregone conclusion; we already have noted our assumption that the commentary was a substantial cause of the Council's refusal to reappoint the plaintiff to a new term on the Commission. It necessarily follows that this appeal hinges on the second step in the chaconne: the \"balance between the interests of the [plaintiff], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the [government], as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\" <i>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968).</p>\n<p>The <i>Pickering</i> balancing test is heavily dependent on context, and the Supreme Court has established a corollary to this test with respect to policymaking employees. The seminal case is <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976), in which the Court held that a government employer cannot discharge an employee merely because he is not affiliated with a particular political party. <i>Id.</i> at 373, 96 S.Ct. 2673 (plurality op.). But the Court noted an exception: a government employer can terminate a <i>policymaking</i> employee based on party affiliation. <i>Id.</i> at 367, 96 S.Ct. 2673. \"This exception helps to ensure that elected representatives will not be hamstrung in endeavoring to carry out the voters' mandate.\" <i>Galloza,</i> 389 F.3d at 28.</p>\n<p>The Court later broadened the exception to include any employee for whom \"party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved.\" <i>Branti v. Finkel,</i> 445 U.S. 507, 518, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980). Thus, when a government employer takes an adverse employment action against such a policymaking employee based on the latter's political affiliation, it has \"demonstrate[d] a compelling interest in infringing First Amendment rights.\" <i>Rutan v. Repub. Party of Ill.,</i> 497 U.S. 62, 71 n. 5, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has not squarely addressed the question of whether, or how, the <i>Elrod/Branti</i> exception applies to a policymaking employee's First Amendment claim premised on speech rather than political affiliation. Nevertheless, a number of courts of appeals have concluded that the principles undergirding the <i>Elrod/Branti</i> exception provide roughly comparable shelter for a government employer where a policymaker is cashiered for policy-related speech. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rose v. Stephens,</i> 291 F.3d 917, 921 (6th Cir.2002); <i>Warzon v. Drew,</i> 60 F.3d 1234, 1238 (7th Cir.1995); <i>Hall v. Ford,</i> 856 F.2d 255, 263 (D.C.Cir.1988). These courts sensibly \"recognize[] the inherent inconsistency in a rule that protects a policymaking employee who overtly expresses his disloyalty while denying that same protection to one who merely belongs to a different political <span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> party.\" <i>Rose,</i> 291 F.3d at 922; <i>accord </i><i>Vargas-Harrison v. Racine Unified Sch. Dist.,</i> 272 F.3d 964, 971-72 (7th Cir.2001). Although acknowledging that the <i>Pickering</i> balance must still be struck, these courts employ <i>Elrod/Branti</i> principles to inform that exercise. <i>See </i><i>Vargas-Harrison,</i> 272 F.3d at 971. In public employee/public speech cases involving policymakers, those principles ordinarily will tip the balance in favor of the government as a matter of law.<sup>[2]</sup><i>See </i><i>Rose,</i> 291 F.3d at 922; <i>Vargas-Harrison,</i> 272 F.3d at 971.</p>\n<p>The key precedent in this circuit fits tongue and groove with this case law. <i>See </i><i>Flynn v. City of Boston,</i> 140 F.3d 42, 47 (1st Cir.1998). That decision involved a challenge to the dismissal of two policymaking employees on both free speech and free association grounds. In ruling for the employer, we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>it is a reasonable working rule that, where the employee is subject to discharge for political reasons under the <i>Elrod</i> and <i>Branti</i> cases, a superior may also  without offending the First Amendment's free speech guarantee  consider the official's substantive views on agency matters in deciding whether to retain the official in a policy related position.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> \"Precisely because [the plaintiffs'] speech did bear on the job and on their working relationship,\" the employer \"was permitted to conclude reasonably that she did not have the necessary trust and confidence to retain them.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>We think that this approach follows logically from the Supreme Court's repeated admonition in the political affiliation cases that the government must be allowed to accomplish its policy objectives through loyal, cooperative deputies whom the public will perceive as sharing the administration's goals. <i>See </i><i>Rutan,</i> 497 U.S. at 74, 110 S.Ct. 2729; <i>Rankin v. McPherson,</i> 483 U.S. 378, 388, 107 S.Ct. 2891, 97 L.Ed.2d 315 (1987). In the political affiliation cases, the Court made a \"[c]ategorical judgment[] based on experience and common sense\" that an \"elected official is entitled to insist on the loyalty of his policymaking subordinates.\" <i>Wilbur v. Mahan,</i> 3 F.3d 214, 218 (7th Cir.1993). The same commonsense tenets are in play when a policymaker, by espousing contrary views, openly undermines the appointing authority's interest in ensuring that its policies will be implemented. <i>See </i><i>Vargas-Harrison,</i> 272 F.3d at 971. \"[D]isagreement between the employer and the policymaking employee over job-related policy issues causes the same failure of loyalty and shared political mission between superior and subordinate as inconsistent political affiliation or viewpoint.\" <i>Bonds v. Milwaukee Cnty.,</i> 207 F.3d 969, 978 (7th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p>We add that transplantation of <i>Elrod/Branti</i> principles to speech cases is consistent with <i>Pickering's</i> goal of balancing the government's interest in effective governance with the employee's right to speak out on matters of public concern. <i>See </i><i>Pickering,</i> 391 U.S. at 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731. The <i>Pickering</i> Court recognized the \"significantly different considerations\" that attend the dismissal of an employee in circumstances in which loyalty is essential. <i>Id.</i> at 570 n. 3, 88 S.Ct. 1731; <i>see </i><i>Rankin,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> 483 U.S. at 388, 107 S.Ct. 2891. In a case involving policy-related speech, like this one, those considerations ought to weigh heavily in the <i>Pickering</i> balance.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>What we have said to this point dictates the decisional framework that applies here. The <i>Elrod/Branti</i> line of cases must inform the <i>Pickering</i> balance whenever a policymaking employee is dismissed for speech elucidating his views on job-related public policy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Distinguishing Characteristics.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Thus far, our analysis has focused on the First Amendment rights of policymakers ousted from public employment due to political affiliation and/or speech. The plaintiff does not fit that mold precisely. For one thing, he was not a government employee but, rather, a volunteer. For another thing, he was not fired but, rather, denied reappointment. In the circumstances of this case, however, neither of those distinctions inhibits the applicability of either <i>Pickering</i> or <i>Elrod/Branti</i> principles. We explain briefly.</p>\n<p>Although some courts have ruled that volunteers hold their unpaid government positions in the unfettered discretion of the appointing authority, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Griffith v. Lanier,</i> 521 F.3d 398, 404 (D.C.Cir. 2008); <i>Versarge v. Twp. of Clinton,</i> 984 F.2d 1359, 1370 (3d Cir.1993), we need not solve that riddle. For present purposes, it is enough to say that the government's interest in ensuring that its policymakers sing from the same sheet music applies equally to policymakers who are hired hands and policymakers who are unpaid advisors.</p>\n<p>By like token, the fact that the plaintiff was denied reappointment, rather than dismissed, does not alter the relevant calculus. <i>See </i><i>Barton v. Clancy,</i> 632 F.3d 9, 26 (1st Cir.2011); <i>Ward v. Hickey,</i> 996 F.2d 448, 452 (1st Cir.1993). Where, as here, the adverse action involves the denial of an appointment to an unpaid advisory post that deals with policy matters, the government's interest in effective and efficient operation is on a par with its interest when the action involves the removal of an employee from a paid policymaking position. <i>See </i><i>Barton,</i> 632 F.3d at 26.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>The Merits.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Having determined that the principles underpinning the <i>Elrod/Branti</i> exception are transferable to public employee/public speech cases, we turn to whether the position that the plaintiff sought was policymaking in nature and, if so, whether the speech that prompted the denial of reappointment was policy related. <i>See </i><i>Rose,</i> 291 F.3d at 924; <i>Warzon,</i> 60 F.3d at 1239. These are quintessentially legal questions. <i>See </i><i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 44.</p>\n<p>This inquiry is both position-specific and speech-specific. <i>See </i><i>Bonds,</i> 207 F.3d at 977-78; <i>see also </i><i>Galloza,</i> 389 F.3d at 29. First, we examine position-specific features starting with a \"high-level glimpse\" at whether the particular position deals with matters that are potentially subject to differences of opinion on policy grounds. <i>Galloza,</i> 389 F.3d at 29. This assessment encompasses the extent to which the position has the capacity to \"influence[] the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> resolution of such matters.\" <i>Mendez-Palou v. Rohena-Betancourt,</i> 813 F.2d 1255, 1258 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n<p>We need not tarry. The Commission is obviously a policymaking body. Its principal function is to advise the Council, which is the Town's legislative and policymaking arm. <i>See</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 49-B:2(IV)(d); <i>Town of Hooksett v. Baines,</i> 148 N.H. 625, 813 A.2d 474, 475-76 (2002). State law and the town charter confer upon the Commission broad duties relating to the formulation and implementation of park policy and the responsibility to work with other governmental actors to coordinate and promote recreational activities. N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 35-B:3; Bedford, N.H., Charter art. 1-11-1(c). The Commission's responsibilities call for the exercise of discretionary judgment on matters of importance to the Town and its inhabitants and involve policy issues on which there is room for disagreement as to both goals and methods of implementation. <i>See </i><i>Jimenez Fuentes v. Torres Gaztambide,</i> 807 F.2d 236, 241-42 (1st Cir.1986) (en banc). That these responsibilities are exercised subject to Council approval does not alter their fundamental character.</p>\n<p>The second element of this position-specific assessment focuses on whether the responsibilities of the position itself \"sufficiently resemble those of a policymaker.\" <i>Galloza,</i> 389 F.3d at 29. An important datum is whether the ability to do the work effectively will be enhanced by the appointment of persons who hold particular policy views. An office-holder who is principally involved with policy, \"even if only as an adviser,\" qualifies as a policymaker. <i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 46.</p>\n<p>The position in question fits neatly within this paradigm. Although there is no formal job description for the position, the Commission's raison d'être involves policymaking, and members of the Commission are the instruments for carrying out that mission. Individual Commission members work directly with elected officials and have a considerable capacity to influence municipal decisions affecting parks and recreation. They are, therefore, policymakers. <i>See </i><i>Vargas-Harrison,</i> 272 F.3d at 971; <i>Ortiz-Piñero v. Rivera-Arroyo,</i> 84 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>The plaintiff suggests that because the position is merely advisory, it cannot involve policymaking. This suggestion sets up a false dichotomy. A person need not possess the ultimate decisionmaking authority in order to qualify as a policymaker. Advisors can be policymakers. <i>See </i><i>Elrod,</i> 427 U.S. at 368, 96 S.Ct. 2673; <i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 46.</p>\n<p>The last piece of the puzzle is speech-specific. We ask whether the speech in question fairly can be said to conflict with the appointing authority's stated policies on matters related to the Commission's work. <i>See </i><i>Rose,</i> 291 F.3d at 924; <i>Vargas-Harrison,</i> 272 F.3d at 973. This aspect of the matter is open and shut.</p>\n<p>In the weeks before the Council took the challenged action, the plaintiff made it crystal clear (openly and vociferously) that he disagreed with the Council's approach to the BVC project. In addition, he publicly opposed the Council's choice of a preferred funding mechanism for the project. These views are plainly policy related and bear directly on matters that the Council reasonably could expect to fall within the purview of the Commission. On the undisputed facts, the necessary link between the speech and the position has been forged.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*87</span> In an effort to change the trajectory of the debate, the plaintiff argues that diversity of viewpoints among Commission members is beneficial to enlightened governance. That may be true, but the choice is up to the Council. The First Amendment does not require that an appointing authority surround itself with policymakers who represent divergent viewpoints. <i>See </i><i>Wilbur,</i> 3 F.3d at 218; <i>see also </i><i>Connick,</i> 461 U.S. at 146, 103 S.Ct. 1684 (\"[G]overnment officials should enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices, without intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the First Amendment.\").</p>\n<p>In this case, all roads lead to Rome. A position-specific assessment makes manifest that compatibility of views is a reasonable requirement for appointment to the Commission. A speech-specific assessment makes manifest that the plaintiff's comments on matters within the purview of the Commission could reasonably have been seen by the defendants as demonstrating a lack of the desired compatibility. Under these circumstances, <i>Elrod/Branti</i> principles require a finding that the defendants' interest in providing effective and efficient government preponderates over the plaintiff's First Amendment interest in free expression of his views. <i>See </i><i>O'Hare Truck Serv., Inc. v. City of Northlake,</i> 518 U.S. 712, 719, 116 S.Ct. 2353, 135 L.Ed.2d 874 (1996); <i>Bonds,</i> 207 F.3d at 977. Consequently, the <i>Pickering</i> balance must be struck in favor of permitting the defendants to rely on the plaintiff's public comments as a reason for declining to reappoint him to the Commission. <i>See </i><i>Vargas-Harrison,</i> 272 F.3d at 974.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. While the plaintiff was within his rights to criticize the Council's vision of the BVC project, the defendants were likewise within their rights in choosing not to reappoint a foe of their policies to serve on a board whose primary function was to give them policymaking advice. Thus, the district court did not err in rejecting the plaintiff's First Amendment claim.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Of course, the plaintiff was an unpaid member of an advisory board rather than a full-fledged employee, and he was denied reappointment rather than discharged. We explain <i>infra</i> why we nonetheless consider the dismissed-employee analogy apt.</p>\n<p>[2]  One circuit has gone even further, ruling that the <i>Elrod/Branti</i> exception for policymakers replaces <i>Pickering</i> in policymaker cases involving policy-related speech. <i>See </i><i>Fazio v. City and Cnty. of San Francisco,</i> 125 F.3d 1328, 1332 (9th Cir. 1997). Under that view, a determination that the employee is a policymaker \"dispos[es] of any First Amendment retaliation claim.\" <i>Biggs v. Best, Best &amp; Krieger,</i> 189 F.3d 989, 994-95 (9th Cir.1999). We hesitate to go so far.</p>\n<p>[3]  We recognize that some courts have thus far confined the application of <i>Elrod</i> and <i>Branti</i> to cases involving political affiliation. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Hinshaw v. Smith,</i> 436 F.3d 997, 1006 (8th Cir.2006); <i>Curinga v. City of Clairton,</i> 357 F.3d 305, 314 (3d Cir.2004); <i>Lewis v. Cowen,</i> 165 F.3d 154, 162 (2d Cir.1999). But the distinction, if one exists, is a matter of degree; those courts freely acknowledge that when the affected employee holds a policymaking position, the government's interest weighs quite heavily in the <i>Pickering</i> balance. <i>See </i><i>Hinshaw,</i> 436 F.3d at 1007; <i>McEvoy v. Spencer,</i> 124 F.3d 92, 103 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>[4]  The plaintiff also alleges that his animadversions against the school board contributed to the refusal to reappoint him to the Commission. This allegation adds nothing to the equation. After all, the Council reasonably could have regarded those comments as interfering with his ability to carry out one of the essential functions of the Commission: coordinating park policy with other public officials. <i>See</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 35-B:3; Bedford, N.H., Charter art. 1-11-1(c).</p>\n\n</div>",

The plaintiff sued, but the district court jettisoned his case at the summary judgment stage. <i>Foote v. Town of Bedford,</i> No. 1:09-cv-171, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3238315</span></span> (D.N.H. Aug. 13, 2010). The plaintiff's appeal presents a nuanced First Amendment question about the relationship between policymakers and policy-related speech in the public sector. After careful consideration, we conclude that the refused reappointment, though premised on a lawful exercise of the plaintiff's right to free speech, did not transgress the First Amendment. Consequently, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We draw the facts from the summary judgment record and rehearse them in the light most favorable to the nonmovant (here, the plaintiff). <i>Galloza v. Foy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201328\"><a href=\"/opinion/201328/galloza-gonzalez-v-foy/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>The organic governing document of Bedford, New Hampshire (the Town), is the town charter, which vests primary responsibility for the administration of municipal affairs in a seven-member town council (the Council). The charter imbues the Council with authority to appoint the members of municipal boards and commissions, including the Bedford Recreation Commission (the Commission). The Commission's bailiwick is to propound recommendations to the Council and the Town Manager about \"the acquisition, holding, and disposition\" of recreational facilities, the staffing of those facilities, and the \"rules and regulations\" for their operation. Bedford, N.H., Charter art. 1-11-1(c)(2).</p>\n<p>The Commission holds regular meetings that are open to the public. It is composed of five members, all of whom serve without compensation. They are appointed by the Council, typically for staggered three-year terms (although some appointments are for shorter periods, say, if a commissioner dies or resigns mid-term).</p>\n<p>On May 11, 2005, the Council appointed plaintiff-appellant William Foote to fill a vacancy in the Commission's ranks. Upon completing the unexpired portion of that term, he was reappointed for three years. For aught that appears, his service was exemplary.</p>\n<p>In January of 2009, the plaintiff received a letter reminding him that his term would expire in March and inquiring about whether he wished to continue. The letter made pellucid that reappointment would be in the Council's sole discretion. The plaintiff replied that he would be pleased to return to the Commission.</p>\n<p>On March 6, the plaintiff attended a meeting of a committee formed to assist in developing a community park project denominated as Bedford Village Common (BVC). At the meeting, he voiced opposition to the Council's plan to revise certain aspects of the proposed project and (over the Council's objections) advocated the use of impact fees as a funding mechanism to assure financial viability. In a particularly pointed exchange, he accused the Council of \"trying to kill the project with a thousand paper cuts.\"</p>\n<p>A municipal election took place on March 10. The plaintiff lost a bid for a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> seat on the school board. In defeat, he warned that he would be watching how the school board handled its budget.</p>\n<p>With the election in his rear-view mirror, the plaintiff continued to press his candidacy for reappointment to the Commission. To that end, he met with members of the newly constituted Council. At a meeting held on March 16, the Council, voting four to three, proposed filling the two vacancies on the Commission with other aspirants. In a later vote, the Council named those aspirants to the Commission.</p>\n<p>Asserting that his vocal criticism in connection with the BVC project led to this rebuff, the plaintiff sued the Town and four councillors who had voted to deny him reappointment (William Dermody, Michael Izbicki, Paul F. Roy, Sr., and Robert Young). He brought his suit in a New Hampshire state court, alleging a First Amendment claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and three supplemental state-law claims. The defendants removed the case to federal district court, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441(b), 1446, and in due season sought summary judgment, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. The plaintiff opposed summary judgment.</p>\n<p>The district court entered summary judgment on the section 1983 claim and remanded the remaining claims to state court. <i>Foote,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3238315</span></span>, at *4-5. It reasoned that the defendants' \"strong interest\" in appointing like-minded people to the Commission outweighed the plaintiff's First Amendment rights. <i>Id.</i> at *4. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>We divide our substantive discussion into four segments.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Standard of Review.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review the entry of summary judgment de novo. <i>Houlton Citizens' Coal. v. Town of Houlton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763565\"><a href=\"/opinion/763565/houlton-citizens-coalition-v-town-of-houlton/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span>, 184 (1st Cir.1999). In performing this tamisage, we scrutinize the facts in the light most agreeable to the nonmovant, ceding all reasonable inferences therefrom in his favor. <i>Cox v. Hainey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201366\"><a href=\"/opinion/201366/cox-v-maine-state-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.2004). Summary judgment is appropriate only if the record, viewed in the required light, reveals no genuine issue of material fact and demonstrates that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. Withal, we are not married to the trial court's rationale but may uphold its ruling on any ground made manifest by the record. <i>Houlton Citizens' Coal.,</i> 175 F.3d at 184; <i>Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536033\"><a href=\"/opinion/536033/milissa-garside-v-osco-drug-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 48-49 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Decisional Framework.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The plaintiff's case stands or falls on his claim that the individual defendants impermissibly refused to reappoint him to the Commission because of his public opposition to, and criticism of, certain municipal policies. For summary judgment purposes, the district court assumed that this reason underpinned his failed bid for reappointment, and so do we. This assumption is important because \"the First Amendment protects a public employee's right, in certain circumstances, to speak as a citizen addressing matters of public concern.\"<sup>[1]</sup><i>Garcetti v. Ceballos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span>, 417, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span> (2006). As this case illustrates, that right is not absolute.</p>\n<p>When speech by a public employee is involved, courts typically choreograph a three-step chaconne. The first step is to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> determine whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern. <i>Id.</i> at 415-16, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span>. The second step is to balance the employee's First Amendment interests against the interests of the government, as an employer, in providing effective and efficient services. <i>Waters v. Churchill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087950\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087950/waters-v-churchill/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></a></span>, 668, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087950\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087950/waters-v-churchill/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1878</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087950\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087950/waters-v-churchill/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span> (1994). At the third and final step, the employee must \"show that the protected expression was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision.\" <i>Curran v. Cousins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203052\"><a href=\"/opinion/203052/curran-v-cousins/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>For present purposes, the defendants do not dispute that the plaintiff spoke out as a citizen and that his public commentary related to matters of community concern. Thus, his speech triggers First Amendment analysis. <i>See </i><i>Connick v. Myers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110917\"><a href=\"/opinion/110917/connick-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 146, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110917\"><a href=\"/opinion/110917/connick-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span> (1983). The third step here is a foregone conclusion; we already have noted our assumption that the commentary was a substantial cause of the Council's refusal to reappoint the plaintiff to a new term on the Commission. It necessarily follows that this appeal hinges on the second step in the chaconne: the \"balance between the interests of the [plaintiff], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the [government], as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\" <i>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span>, 568, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">811</span></a></span> (1968).</p>\n<p>The <i>Pickering</i> balancing test is heavily dependent on context, and the Supreme Court has established a corollary to this test with respect to policymaking employees. The seminal case is <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109517\"><a href=\"/opinion/109517/elrod-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109517\"><a href=\"/opinion/109517/elrod-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span> (1976), in which the Court held that a government employer cannot discharge an employee merely because he is not affiliated with a particular political party. <i>Id.</i> at 373, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109517\"><a href=\"/opinion/109517/elrod-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2673</span></a></span> (plurality op.). But the Court noted an exception: a government employer can terminate a <i>policymaking</i> employee based on party affiliation. <i>Id.</i> at 367, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109517\"><a href=\"/opinion/109517/elrod-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nevertheless, a number of courts of appeals have concluded that the principles undergirding the <i>Elrod/Branti</i> exception provide roughly comparable shelter for a government employer where a policymaker is cashiered for policy-related speech. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rose v. Stephens,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777807\"><a href=\"/opinion/777807/gary-w-rose-v-robert-f-stephens-individually-and-in-his-official/\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">917</span></a></span>, 921 (6th Cir.2002); <i>Warzon v.

These courts sensibly \"recognize[] the inherent inconsistency in a rule that protects a policymaking employee who overtly expresses his disloyalty while denying that same protection to one who merely belongs to a different political <span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> party.\" <i>Rose,</i> 291 F.3d at 922; <i>accord </i><i>Vargas-Harrison v.

Although acknowledging that the <i>Pickering</i> balance must still be struck, these courts employ <i>Elrod/Branti</i> principles to inform that exercise. <i>See </i><i>Vargas-Harrison,</i> 272 F.3d at 971. In public employee/public speech cases involving policymakers, those principles ordinarily will tip the balance in favor of the government as a matter of law.<sup>[2]</sup><i>See </i><i>Rose,</i> 291 F.3d at 922; <i>Vargas-Harrison,</i> 272 F.3d at 971.</p>\n<p>The key precedent in this circuit fits tongue and groove with this case law. <i>See </i><i>Flynn v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197945\"><a href=\"/opinion/197945/flynn-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.1998). That decision involved a challenge to the dismissal of two policymaking employees on both free speech and free association grounds. In ruling for the employer, we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>it is a reasonable working rule that, where the employee is subject to discharge for political reasons under the <i>Elrod</i> and <i>Branti</i> cases, a superior may also  without offending the First Amendment's free speech guarantee  consider the official's substantive views on agency matters in deciding whether to retain the official in a policy related position.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> \"Precisely because [the plaintiffs'] speech did bear on the job and on their working relationship,\" the employer \"was permitted to conclude reasonably that she did not have the necessary trust and confidence to retain them.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>We think that this approach follows logically from the Supreme Court's repeated admonition in the political affiliation cases that the government must be allowed to accomplish its policy objectives through loyal, cooperative deputies whom the public will perceive as sharing the administration's goals. <i>See </i><i>Rutan,</i> 497 U.S. at 74, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112472\"><a href=\"/opinion/112472/rutan-v-republican-party-of-ill/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span> (1987). In the political affiliation cases, the Court made a \"[c]ategorical judgment[] based on experience and common sense\" that an \"elected official is entitled to insist on the loyalty of his policymaking subordinates.\" <i>Wilbur v. Mahan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628658\"><a href=\"/opinion/628658/roy-wilbur-v-charles-l-mahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, 218 (7th Cir.1993). The same commonsense tenets are in play when a policymaker, by espousing contrary views, openly undermines the appointing authority's interest in ensuring that its policies will be implemented. <i>See </i><i>Vargas-Harrison,</i> 272 F.3d at 971. \"[D]isagreement between the employer and the policymaking employee over job-related policy issues causes the same failure of loyalty and shared political mission between superior and subordinate as inconsistent political affiliation or viewpoint.\" <i>Bonds v. Milwaukee Cnty.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768154\"><a href=\"/opinion/768154/michael-bonds-v-milwaukee-county-karen-ordinans-william-hart-and-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">969</span></a></span>, 978 (7th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p>We add that transplantation of <i>Elrod/Branti</i> principles to speech cases is consistent with <i>Pickering's</i> goal of balancing the government's interest in effective governance with the employee's right to speak out on matters of public concern. <i>See </i><i>Pickering,</i> 391 U.S. at 568, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2891</span></a></span>. In a case involving policy-related speech, like this one, those considerations ought to weigh heavily in the <i>Pickering</i> balance.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>What we have said to this point dictates the decisional framework that applies here. The <i>Elrod/Branti</i> line of cases must inform the <i>Pickering</i> balance whenever a policymaking employee is dismissed for speech elucidating his views on job-related public policy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Distinguishing Characteristics.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Thus far, our analysis has focused on the First Amendment rights of policymakers ousted from public employment due to political affiliation and/or speech. The plaintiff does not fit that mold precisely. For one thing, he was not a government employee but, rather, a volunteer. For another thing, he was not fired but, rather, denied reappointment. In the circumstances of this case, however, neither of those distinctions inhibits the applicability of either <i>Pickering</i> or <i>Elrod/Branti</i> principles. We explain briefly.</p>\n<p>Although some courts have ruled that volunteers hold their unpaid government positions in the unfettered discretion of the appointing authority, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Griffith v. Lanier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187147\"><a href=\"/opinion/187147/griffith-v-lanier/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span>, 404 (D.C.Cir. 2008); <i>Versarge v. Twp. of Clinton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599263\"><a href=\"/opinion/599263/paul-versarge-v-the-township-of-clinton-new-jersey-annandale-hose-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1359</span></a></span>, 1370 (3d Cir.1993), we need not solve that riddle. For present purposes, it is enough to say that the government's interest in ensuring that its policymakers sing from the same sheet music applies equally to policymakers who are hired hands and policymakers who are unpaid advisors.</p>\n<p>By like token, the fact that the plaintiff was denied reappointment, rather than dismissed, does not alter the relevant calculus. <i>See </i><i>Barton v. Clancy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"182845\"><a href=\"/opinion/182845/barton-v-clancy/\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2011); <i>Ward v. Hickey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609733\"><a href=\"/opinion/609733/toby-klang-ward-v-carol-hickey-toby-klang-ward-v-carol-a-hickey-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span>, 452 (1st Cir.1993). Where, as here, the adverse action involves the denial of an appointment to an unpaid advisory post that deals with policy matters, the government's interest in effective and efficient operation is on a par with its interest when the action involves the removal of an employee from a paid policymaking position. <i>See </i><i>Barton,</i> 632 F.3d at 26.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>The Merits.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Having determined that the principles underpinning the <i>Elrod/Branti</i> exception are transferable to public employee/public speech cases, we turn to whether the position that the plaintiff sought was policymaking in nature and, if so, whether the speech that prompted the denial of reappointment was policy related. <i>See </i><i>Rose,</i> 291 F.3d at 924; <i>Warzon,</i> 60 F.3d at 1239. These are quintessentially legal questions. <i>See </i><i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 44.</p>\n<p>This inquiry is both position-specific and speech-specific. <i>See </i><i>Bonds,</i> 207 F.3d at 977-78; <i>see also </i><i>Galloza,</i> 389 F.3d at 29. First, we examine position-specific features starting with a \"high-level glimpse\" at whether the particular position deals with matters that are potentially subject to differences of opinion on policy grounds. <i>Galloza,</i> 389 F.3d at 29. This assessment encompasses the extent to which the position has the capacity to \"influence[] the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> resolution of such matters.\" <i>Mendez-Palou v. Rohena-Betancourt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484880\"><a href=\"/opinion/484880/juan-a-mendez-palou-v-santos-rohena-betancourt-etc-jose-m-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">813</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1255</span></a></span>, 1258 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n<p>We need not tarry. The Commission is obviously a policymaking body. Its principal function is to advise the Council, which is the Town's legislative and policymaking arm. <i>See</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 49-B:2(IV)(d); <i>Town of Hooksett v. Baines,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">813</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></span>, 475-76 (2002). State law and the town charter confer upon the Commission broad duties relating to the formulation and implementation of park policy and the responsibility to work with other governmental actors to coordinate and promote recreational activities. N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 35-B:3; Bedford, N.H., Charter art. 1-11-1(c). The Commission's responsibilities call for the exercise of discretionary judgment on matters of importance to the Town and its inhabitants and involve policy issues on which there is room for disagreement as to both goals and methods of implementation. <i>See </i><i>Jimenez Fuentes v. Torres Gaztambide,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480539\"><a href=\"/opinion/480539/arnaldo-jimenez-fuentes-v-honorable-jaime-torres-gaztambide/\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 241-42 (1st Cir.1986) (en banc). That these responsibilities are exercised subject to Council approval does not alter their fundamental character.</p>\n<p>The second element of this position-specific assessment focuses on whether the responsibilities of the position itself \"sufficiently resemble those of a policymaker.\" <i>Galloza,</i> 389 F.3d at 29. An important datum is whether the ability to do the work effectively will be enhanced by the appointment of persons who hold particular policy views. An office-holder who is principally involved with policy, \"even if only as an adviser,\" qualifies as a policymaker. <i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 46.</p>\n<p>The position in question fits neatly within this paradigm. Although there is no formal job description for the position, the Commission's raison d'être involves policymaking, and members of the Commission are the instruments for carrying out that mission. Individual Commission members work directly with elected officials and have a considerable capacity to influence municipal decisions affecting parks and recreation. They are, therefore, policymakers. <i>See </i><i>Vargas-Harrison,</i> 272 F.3d at 971; <i>Ortiz-Piñero v. Rivera-Arroyo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196764\"><a href=\"/opinion/196764/ortiz-pinero-v-rivera-arroyo/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>The plaintiff suggests that because the position is merely advisory, it cannot involve policymaking. This suggestion sets up a false dichotomy. A person need not possess the ultimate decisionmaking authority in order to qualify as a policymaker. Advisors can be policymakers. <i>See </i><i>Elrod,</i> 427 U.S. at 368, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109517\"><a href=\"/opinion/109517/elrod-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2673</span></a></span>; <i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 46.</p>\n<p>The last piece of the puzzle is speech-specific. We ask whether the speech in question fairly can be said to conflict with the appointing authority's stated policies on matters related to the Commission's work. <i>See </i><i>Rose,</i> 291 F.3d at 924; <i>Vargas-Harrison,</i> 272 F.3d at 973. This aspect of the matter is open and shut.</p>\n<p>In the weeks before the Council took the challenged action, the plaintiff made it crystal clear (openly and vociferously) that he disagreed with the Council's approach to the BVC project. In addition, he publicly opposed the Council's choice of a preferred funding mechanism for the project. These views are plainly policy related and bear directly on matters that the Council reasonably could expect to fall within the purview of the Commission. On the undisputed facts, the necessary link between the speech and the position has been forged.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*87</span> In an effort to change the trajectory of the debate, the plaintiff argues that diversity of viewpoints among Commission members is beneficial to enlightened governance. That may be true, but the choice is up to the Council. The First Amendment does not require that an appointing authority surround itself with policymakers who represent divergent viewpoints. <i>See </i><i>Wilbur,</i> 3 F.3d at 218; <i>see also </i><i>Connick,</i> 461 U.S. at 146, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110917\"><a href=\"/opinion/110917/connick-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1684</span></a></span> (\"[G]overnment officials should enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices, without intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the First Amendment.\").</p>\n<p>In this case, all roads lead to Rome. A position-specific assessment makes manifest that compatibility of views is a reasonable requirement for appointment to the Commission. A speech-specific assessment makes manifest that the plaintiff's comments on matters within the purview of the Commission could reasonably have been seen by the defendants as demonstrating a lack of the desired compatibility. Under these circumstances, <i>Elrod/Branti</i> principles require a finding that the defendants' interest in providing effective and efficient government preponderates over the plaintiff's First Amendment interest in free expression of his views. <i>See </i><i>O'Hare Truck Serv., Inc. v. City of Northlake,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118060\"><a href=\"/opinion/118060/ohare-truck-service-inc-v-city-of-northlake/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">712</span></a></span>, 719, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118060\"><a href=\"/opinion/118060/ohare-truck-service-inc-v-city-of-northlake/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">874</span></a></span> (1996); <i>Bonds,</i> 207 F.3d at 977. Consequently, the <i>Pickering</i> balance must be struck in favor of permitting the defendants to rely on the plaintiff's public comments as a reason for declining to reappoint him to the Commission. <i>See </i><i>Vargas-Harrison,</i> 272 F.3d at 974.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. While the plaintiff was within his rights to criticize the Council's vision of the BVC project, the defendants were likewise within their rights in choosing not to reappoint a foe of their policies to serve on a board whose primary function was to give them policymaking advice. Thus, the district court did not err in rejecting the plaintiff's First Amendment claim.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Of course, the plaintiff was an unpaid member of an advisory board rather than a full-fledged employee, and he was denied reappointment rather than discharged. We explain <i>infra</i> why we nonetheless consider the dismissed-employee analogy apt.</p>\n<p>[2]  One circuit has gone even further, ruling that the <i>Elrod/Branti</i> exception for policymakers replaces <i>Pickering</i> in policymaker cases involving policy-related speech. <i>See </i><i>Fazio v. City and Cnty. of San Francisco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746805\"><a href=\"/opinion/746805/william-fazio-v-city-and-county-of-san-francisco-arlo-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1328</span></a></span>, 1332 (9th Cir. 1997). Under that view, a determination that the employee is a policymaker \"dispos[es] of any First Amendment retaliation claim.\" <i>Biggs v. Best, Best &amp; Krieger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765949\"><a href=\"/opinion/765949/julie-h-biggsplaintiff-and-gerard-e-biggs-holly-g-biggs-v-best-best/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span>, 994-95 (9th Cir.1999). We hesitate to go so far.</p>\n<p>[3]  We recognize that some courts have thus far confined the application of <i>Elrod</i> and <i>Branti</i> to cases involving political affiliation. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Hinshaw v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793217\"><a href=\"/opinion/793217/cathryn-e-hinshaw-v-roger-smith-individually-and-as-state-representative/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">997</span></a></span>, 1006 (8th Cir.2006); <i>Curinga v. City of Clairton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784991\"><a href=\"/opinion/784991/domenic-j-curinga-v-city-of-clairton-george-adamson-city-council-member/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span>, 314 (3d Cir.2004); <i>Lewis v. Cowen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760797\"><a href=\"/opinion/760797/j-blaine-lewis-v-bruce-d-cowen-roland-h-lange-and-william-v-hickey/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 162 (2d Cir.1999). But the distinction, if one exists, is a matter of degree; those courts freely acknowledge that when the affected employee holds a policymaking position, the government's interest weighs quite heavily in the <i>Pickering</i> balance. <i>See </i><i>Hinshaw,</i> 436 F.3d at 1007; <i>McEvoy v. Spencer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"745479\"><a href=\"/opinion/745479/albert-r-mcevoy-v-john-spencer-individually-and-as-mayor-of-the-city-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 103 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>[4]  The plaintiff also alleges that his animadversions against the school board contributed to the refusal to reappoint him to the Commission. This allegation adds nothing to the equation. After all, the Council reasonably could have regarded those comments as interfering with his ability to carry out one of the essential functions of the Commission: coordinating park policy with other public officials. <i>See</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 35-B:3; Bedford, N.H., Charter art. 1-11-1(c).</p>\n\n</div>",
