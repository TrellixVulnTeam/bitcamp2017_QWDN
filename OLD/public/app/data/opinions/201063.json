These interlocutory appeals follow\n\nthe entry of an order denying motions to dismiss based on qualified\n\nimmunity.    See Limone v. United States, 271 F. Supp. 2d 345, 349\n\n(D. Mass. 2003).    The appellants exhort us to reverse that decree\n\nor, alternatively, to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over\n\nanother (potentially dispositive) issue.       We conclude that at this\n\nstage of the proceedings (i) the district court appropriately\n\nrejected the appellants' qualified immunity defenses, and (ii) the\n\nscope of these interlocutory appeals should not be broadened to\n\nencompass an unrelated issue.      Consequently, we affirm the denial\n\nof qualified immunity and remand for further development of the\n\nfacts.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            These appeals arise out of two separate but closely\n\nrelated suits, consolidated in the district court.           An explication\n\nof the underlying facts requires the juridical equivalent of an\n\narcheological dig.       The relevant events date back almost four\n\ndecades to the 1965 murder of Edward \"Teddy\" Deegan and the 1968\n\nconvictions of several individuals, including Peter Limone, Louis\n\nGreco, and Henry Tameleo, for that slaying.         Notwithstanding the\n\njury's   verdict   and   the   subsequent   rejection   of    their   direct\n\nappeals, see Commonwealth v. French, 259 N.E.2d 195 (Mass. 1970),\n\nthe three men steadfastly maintained their innocence and mounted a\n\ncampaign to clear their names.           The facts, as now revealed,\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fseemingly support their claims of innocence.     The instant actions\n\nseek damages against those allegedly responsible for their wrongful\n\nconvictions.\n\n            For present purposes, the operative pleadings are the two\n\namended complaints.1    Those complaints are separate but similar.\n\nWe compile the following account of the facts by reading the\n\namended complaints in tandem, drawing all reasonable inferences\n\ntherefrom in the light most agreeable to the plaintiffs (as the\n\nparties opposing the motions to dismiss).     We note, however, that\n\nthe district court recounted the factual allegations set out in the\n\namended complaints at some length, see Limone, 271 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n349-53, and we urge those who hunger for greater detail to consult\n\nthat rescript.\n\n            The plaintiffs — Limone (the only surviving member of the\n\ntrio), the estates of Greco and Tameleo, and various relatives\n\nasserting derivative claims — have sued both a quondam agent of the\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and a retired Boston police\n\nofficer.2   The amended complaints allege that the former FBI agent,\n\n\n     1\n      There are two suits rather than three because Limone and\nTameleo's heirs and personal representatives joined in the filing\nof a single action.    Greco's executrix and heirs chose to sue\nseparately.\n     2\n      The plaintiffs actually sought damages against several other\nparties as well, asserting a salmagundi of federal and state-law\ntheories. See Limone, 271 F. Supp. 2d at 348 n.3 (identifying the\ndefendants and delineating the claims). One such party, former FBI\nagent H. Paul Rico, died on January 16, 2004. When no personal\nrepresentative came forward on his behalf, we dismissed his pending\n\n                                 -4-\n\fDennis Condon, and the former Boston detective, Frank L. Walsh,\n\nframed Limone, Greco, and Tameleo, assisted the Commonwealth of\n\nMassachusetts in wrongly convicting them on a charge of first-\n\ndegree murder, participated in a coverup, and allowed the three\n\ninnocent men to languish in prison for years.3   In relevant part,\n\nthe complaints assert Bivens claims against Condon, see Bivens v.\n\nSix Unknown Named Agents of the FBN, 403 U.S. 388, 397 (1971), and\n\nsection 1983 claims against Walsh, see 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000).\n\nThe central theme of these claims is the accusation that Condon and\n\nWalsh, inter alios, violated the Constitution by developing one\n\nJoseph \"Baron\" Barboza as a witness for the prosecution in spite of\n\ntheir knowledge that Barboza would perjure himself and falsely\n\nimplicate three innocent men in Deegan's murder.\n\n          Condon and Walsh (appellants here) moved to dismiss both\n\namended complaints based on the doctrine of qualified immunity.\n\nThey simultaneously moved to dismiss the suits brought on behalf of\n\nGreco and Tameleo on the ground that those plaintiffs had failed to\n\nsatisfy the favorable termination requirement (described infra Part\n\nIII) laid down by the Supreme Court in Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S.\n\n\n\nappeal without prejudice. The other defendants are not parties to\nthese interlocutory appeals.\n     3\n      Although a Massachusetts state court judge originally\nsentenced the trio to death, the United States Supreme Court\nsubsequently vacated that disposition.     See, e.g., Limone v.\nMassachusetts, 408 U.S. 936 (1972). Eventually, all the sentences\nwere commuted to life imprisonment.\n\n                               -5-\n\f477, 486-87 (1994). The district court rebuffed these initiatives.\n\nAs to qualified immunity, the court found it inconceivable that, at\n\nthe time of the relevant events, \"a reasonable law enforcement\n\nofficer would have thought it permissible to frame somebody for a\n\ncrime he or she did not commit.\"             Limone, 271 F. Supp. 2d at 365-\n\n66.    As   to   Heck,   the   court   found     the   favorable   termination\n\nrequirement satisfied vis-à-vis the Greco and Tameleo plaintiffs on\n\na theory of constructive reversal and, alternatively, on a theory\n\nof estoppel.     Id. at 361.    These timely appeals ensued.\n\nII.   THE QUALIFIED IMMUNITY DEFENSE\n\n            Condon and Walsh have appealed from the district court's\n\norder denying their motions to dismiss based on qualified immunity.\n\nAn interlocutory appeal lies from such an order where, as here,\n\nqualified immunity turns on abstract legal questions.               Stella v.\n\nKelley, 63 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir. 1995).                We review the district\n\ncourt's order de novo, directing dismissal of the complaints \"only\n\nif it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of\n\nfacts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.\"\n\nHishon v. King & Spaulding, 467 U.S. 69, 73 (1984).\n\n            We begin with first principles.            Qualified immunity is a\n\njudge-made doctrine. The elementary justification for the doctrine\n\nis that public officials performing discretionary functions should\n\nbe free to act without fear of retributive suits for damages except\n\nwhen they should have understood that particular conduct was\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\funlawful.      Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 195 (1984).                         That\n\nawareness depends, in large part, on the extent to which legal\n\nrules were clearly established when the official acted.                    Harlow v.\n\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).             It follows that an inquiry\n\ninto the reasonableness of an officer's conduct must focus both on\n\nwhat the officer did (or failed to do) and on the state of the law\n\nat the time of the alleged act or omission.                      Savard v. Rhode\n\nIsland, 338 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir. 2003) (en banc), cert. denied,\n\n124 S. Ct. 1074 (2004); Iacobucci v. Boulter, 193 F.3d 14, 21 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).       In the end, the qualified immunity defense should\n\nprevail unless the unlawfulness of the challenged conduct was\n\n\"apparent\" when undertaken.        Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635,\n\n640 (1987).\n\n              Although   these   appeals     involve        claims   based    on    two\n\ndifferent legal theories — Bivens and section 1983 — the analytical\n\nframework is, for our purposes, identical.                  See Wilson v. Layne,\n\n526 U.S. 603, 609 (1999). Drawing on Supreme Court precedent, see,\n\ne.g., Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 200-02 (2001), we have\n\ndeveloped a three-part algorithm for assessing whether a federal or\n\nstate actor is entitled to qualified immunity.                   We consider (i)\n\nwhether     the   plaintiff's    allegations,          if    true,    establish       a\n\nconstitutional violation; (ii) whether the constitutional right at\n\nissue   was    clearly    established       at   the   time     of   the     putative\n\nviolation;     and   (iii)   whether    a    reasonable        officer,      situated\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fsimilarly to the defendant, would have understood the challenged\n\nact or omission to contravene the discerned constitutional right.\n\nSavard, 338 F.3d at 27.   More often than not, proper development of\n\nthe law of qualified immunity is advanced if courts treat these\n\nthree questions sequentially.         See Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201;\n\nFabiano v. Hopkins, 352 F.3d 447, 453 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                  A\n\n          The threshold question in a qualified immunity appeal\n\ncenters on the current state of the law.      On a motion to dismiss,\n\nthis question asks whether the facts alleged, viewed in the light\n\nmost favorable to the complaining party, show that the officer's\n\nconduct violated some constitutional right. Siegert v. Gilley, 500\n\nU.S. 226, 232-33 (1991); Santana v. Calderón, 342 F.3d 18, 23 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).   We turn directly to that question.\n\n          The amended complaints paint a sordid picture.    Although\n\nthe misdeeds described therein are many and varied, the plaintiffs'\n\nclaims may be distilled into two basic allegations:      first, that\n\nthe appellants purposefully suborned false testimony from a key\n\nwitness; and second, that the appellants suppressed exculpatory\n\nevidence in an effort both to cover up their own malefactions and\n\nto shield the actual murderers (one of whom was being groomed as an\n\nFBI informant).   The complaints weave these allegations together.\n\nFrom that platform, the plaintiffs asseverate that an individual's\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fright not to be convicted by these tawdry means — his right not to\n\nbe framed by the government — is beyond doubt.\n\n            This      is    easy     pickings.         Although   constitutional\n\ninterpretation occasionally can prove recondite, some truths are\n\nself-evident.      This is one such:          if any concept is fundamental to\n\nour American system of justice, it is that those charged with\n\nupholding the law are prohibited from deliberately fabricating\n\nevidence and framing individuals for crimes they did not commit.\n\nSee, e.g., Devereaux v. Abbey, 263 F.3d 1070, 1074-75 (9th Cir.\n\n2001)   (en    banc).         Actions   taken     in    contravention   of   this\n\nprohibition necessarily violate due process (indeed, we are unsure\n\nwhat due process entails if not protection against deliberate\n\nframing under color of official sanction).                  Thus, we resist the\n\ntemptation to expound needlessly upon the first element in the\n\nqualified immunity catechism and simply pronounce that requirement\n\nsatisfied.\n\n                                          B\n\n              The second question in the algorithm asks whether the\n\nstate of the law at the time of the putative violation afforded the\n\ndefendant      fair        warning    that      his    or   her    conduct    was\n\nunconstitutional.          See Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002).\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, that question requires us to\n\ndetermine whether the right not to be framed by law enforcement\n\nagents was clearly established in 1967 — the year in which the\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fappellants are alleged to have started twisting their investigation\n\nto target the plaintiffs.     We think that it was.\n\n          From a jurisprudential perspective, our delving goes back\n\nsome seventy years.   In Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103 (1935) (per\n\ncuriam), the Supreme Court explained that due process\n\n          is a requirement that cannot be deemed to be\n          satisfied by mere notice and hearing if a\n          State has contrived a conviction through the\n          pretense of a trial which in truth is but used\n          as a means of depriving a defendant of liberty\n          through a deliberate deception of court and\n          jury by the presentation of testimony known to\n          be perjured.\n\nId. at 112.   The following term, the Court reaffirmed that the Due\n\nProcess   Clause   forbids    convictions    predicated   on     deliberate\n\ndeceptions.    See Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278, 286 (1936).\n\nSix years later, the Court needed only a single paragraph and a\n\ncitation to Mooney to buttress its conclusion that \"allegations\n\nthat   [the   petitioner's]   imprisonment    resulted    from    perjured\n\ntestimony, knowingly used by the State authorities to obtain his\n\nconviction, and from the deliberate suppression by those same\n\nauthorities of evidence favorable to him . . . sufficiently charge\n\na deprivation of rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.\"\n\nPyle v. Kansas, 317 U.S. 213, 216 (1942).       Given these precedents,\n\nit is not surprising that, as early as 1951, this court described\n\nMooney's core premise as \"well-settled.\"       Coggins v. O'Brien, 188\n\nF.2d 130, 138 (1st Cir. 1951).\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f            In 1959, the Supreme Court confirmed that the Mooney\n\nright covered circumstances in which \"the State, although not\n\nsoliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it\n\nappears.\"   Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269 (1959).    In raising\n\nthe bar to this modest level, the Court recognized that its prior\n\ncase law \"established that a conviction obtained through use of\n\nfalse evidence, known to be such by representatives of the State,\n\nmust fall under the Fourteenth Amendment.\"      Id. (citing Mooney).\n\nThe Court viewed such a right as \"implicit in any concept of\n\nordered liberty.\"     Id.    And in 1967 — the very year that the\n\nviolations in the instant case are alleged to have begun — Justice\n\nStewart, writing for a unanimous Court, reiterated the point:\n\n            More than 30 years ago this Court held that\n            the Fourteenth Amendment cannot tolerate a\n            state criminal conviction obtained by the\n            knowing use of false evidence. There has been\n            no deviation from that established principle.\n\nMiller v. Pate, 386 U.S. 1, 7 (1967) (citations omitted).\n\n            The appellants resist this impressive array of authority\n\non two fronts.   First, they accuse the plaintiffs and the district\n\ncourt of having defined the right in question too broadly.         In\n\ntheir view, modeling the right as a right to be free from a\n\ncontrived conviction — a right not to be framed by the government\n\n— casts too wide a net.     They suggest instead that the plaintiffs'\n\nallegations should be squeezed into a more circumscribed mold and\n\nread as setting forth a Brady violation.      See Brady v. Maryland,\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963) (holding that \"the suppression by the\n\nprosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request\n\nviolates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt\n\nor to punishment\").    Having erected this straw man, the appellants\n\nthen shred it:     although Brady was decided prior to 1967, they\n\nassert that it was not clearly established then (indeed, it may not\n\nbe clearly established today) that the duties imposed by Brady\n\napply to law enforcement officers under circumstances in which the\n\nprosecutor is unaware of the contrivance.          See, e.g., Brady v.\n\nDill, 187 F.3d 104, 114 (1st Cir. 1999) (suggesting that a law\n\nenforcement officer \"sometimes may be liable\" for a failure to\n\nreveal \"known exculpatory information\") (emphasis supplied); Reid\n\nv. Simmons, 163 F. Supp. 2d 81, 84 (D.N.H. 2001) (describing \"the\n\ncircumstances under which police officers may be held civilly\n\nliable   for   Brady   violations\"   as   \"a   matter   of   considerable\n\nuncertainty\"), aff'd, 47 Fed. Appx. 5 (1st Cir. 2002) (per curiam),\n\ncert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 237 (2003).\n\n           It is certainly true that the manner in which a right is\n\ndefined can make or break a qualified immunity defense.            Courts\n\nmust be careful not to permit an artful pleader to convert the\n\ndoctrine of qualified immunity into a hollow safeguard simply by\n\nalleging a violation of an exceedingly nebulous right. See Wilson,\n\n526 U.S. at 614-15; Hatch v. Dep't for Children, Youth & Their\n\nFamilies, 274 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir. 2001).       Courts must be equally\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fcareful,      however,      not   to   permit   a   defendant    to    hijack     the\n\nplaintiff's complaint and recharacterize its allegations so as to\n\nminimize his or her liability.\n\n              Here,   the    amended     complaints,   fairly    read,      are   not\n\nsusceptible to the appellants' animadversions.                The right defined\n\nby the plaintiffs and recognized by the district court does not\n\neven approach the level of generality thought to be impermissible.\n\nSee, e.g., Anderson, 483 U.S. at 639 (discussing what level of\n\ngenerality is permissible with respect to due process violations);\n\nHatch, 274 F.3d at 20 (same, with respect to \"the right to familial\n\nintegrity\" and \"the parental interest in the care, custody, and\n\ncontrol of children\").\n\n              The appellants' argument has an even deeper flaw:                    it\n\nrests    on    a   self-serving        mischaracterization      of    the   factual\n\nallegations set out in the amended complaints. The plaintiffs have\n\nnot pleaded a separate claim that their rights were violated merely\n\nby the appellants' failure to divulge some discrete piece of Brady\n\nevidence.      Rather, they have eschewed such a course in favor of a\n\nmore sweeping accusation that the appellants actively participated\n\nin a plot to secure and sustain unjust convictions against innocent\n\nmen.    Though this scheme includes suballegations that occasionally\n\ninvolve       Brady   violations       (e.g.,   suppression     of    exculpatory\n\ninformation), the overall charge cannot be shoehorned into the\n\nrelatively narrow confines of the Brady rubric.                 As the district\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fcourt put it, the \"individual allegations of non-disclosure\" are\n\nnot meant to be self-sustaining, but, rather, \"are an integral part\n\nof the overall story.\"    Limone, 271 F. Supp. 2d at 366.\n\n            We have said before that \"[t]he sum of an evidentiary\n\npresentation may well be greater than its constituent parts.\"              N.\n\nHeel Corp. v. Compo Indus., Inc., 851 F.2d 456, 470 (1st Cir. 1988)\n\n(quoting Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 180 (1987)).\n\nThat aphorism is pertinent here.          Taken as a whole, the unsavory\n\nenterprise chronicled in the amended complaints is too multifaceted\n\nto fit within the integument of the Brady right.              In contrast, it\n\nfits comfortably within the more expansive contours of the right\n\ndescribed in Mooney.    To restrict the plaintiffs to a Brady claim\n\nwould require us to disregard the forest and focus single-mindedly\n\non a particular tree.     The qualified immunity doctrine does not\n\ncompel courts to take so myopic a view.\n\n            The appellants next attempt to tackle Mooney head-on.\n\nEven if Mooney furnishes the appropriate benchmark, this thesis\n\nruns, the circumstances in Mooney and its pre-1967 progeny are\n\nmaterially distinguishable from those alleged by the plaintiffs.\n\nAccording to the appellants, these were cases in which the falsity\n\nof the testimony was uncontroverted — not cases in which public\n\nofficials   simply   pressed   a   view    of   the   facts    which,   though\n\nultimately proven wrong, was not obviously contrived.             In a modest\n\nvariation on this theme, the appellants add that, as of 1967, there\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fwas no clearly established right to be free from conviction based\n\non testimony known only by law enforcement officers (and not by the\n\nprosecuting attorney) to be false.\n\n            We find these contentions unconvincing. The first, which\n\nat bottom challenges the sufficiency of the pleadings, is easily\n\ndefeated.     These appeals were brought following a decision on\n\nmotions to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and, as such,\n\nall that is required is that the amended complaints allege acts\n\nsufficient to constitute framing and knowledge on the part of the\n\nappellants.       See Educadores Puertorriqueños en Acción v. Rey\n\nHernández, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2004) [No. 03-1588, slip op.\n\nat 12] (rejecting a heightened pleading standard for civil rights\n\ncases).     While the plaintiffs eventually will have to adduce\n\nadequate evidence to support the claim that Condon and Walsh knew\n\nBarboza's story was apocryphal, their bare allegations of knowledge\n\nsuffice at this embryonic stage of the proceedings.              See id.\n\n            The   appellants'   second     contention    fares    no   better.\n\nAlthough the amended complaints do not allege guilty knowledge on\n\nthe part of the prosecuting attorney, no such averment is necessary\n\nto state an actionable claim.           The duty that Mooney and its pre-\n\n1967 progeny      established   —   a   duty   to   refrain   from   procuring\n\nconvictions by the presentation of testimony known to be perjurious\n\n— extended in 1967, as now, to law enforcement officers generally.\n\nThe Supreme Court ascribed this duty broadly to the sovereign and\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fits agents.       See, e.g., Napue, 360 U.S. at 269 (attributing the\n\nduty to \"representatives of the State\"); Pyle, 317 U.S. at 216\n\n(attributing the duty to \"State authorities\"); Mooney, 294 U.S. at\n\n112 (attributing the duty to \"the State\"). It strains credulity to\n\nsuggest that FBI agents and police officers, duly sworn to uphold\n\nthe law, do not fall within the compass of these proscriptions.\n\n               We are not the first court to reach this conclusion.\n\nCiting Pyle, the Fifth Circuit ruled to this effect in 1969.                   See\n\nSmith    v.    Florida,    410     F.2d    1349,    1350-51   (5th   Cir.   1969)\n\n(explaining that police violate the right described in Mooney if\n\nthey suborn perjury even though they do so without the prosecutor's\n\nknowledge). Even more telling, the Third Circuit concluded in 1958\n\n— nine years before Condon and Walsh are alleged to have embarked\n\non their nefarious course of conduct — that Pyle had settled this\n\nvery issue.       See Curran v. Delaware, 259 F.2d 707, 713 (3d Cir.\n\n1958).    An examination of the Pyle record disclosed to the Third\n\nCircuit's satisfaction \"that the prosecuting officer was in no wise\n\na party to or cognizant of the perjured testimony given by certain\n\nwitnesses of the State of Kansas or of the fact that the law\n\nenforcement officers had taken steps to procure false testimony\n\nfavorable to the prosecution.\"              Id.    Although the prosecutor had\n\nbeen    kept    in   the   dark,    the    Pyle    Court   determined   that   the\n\nallegations, if true, would abridge the right described in Mooney.\n\nSee Pyle, 317 U.S. at 216; see also Curran, 259 F.2d at 713\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f(relying on Pyle, reaching the identical conclusion, and finding\n\nsuch a violation).     We agree with this interpretation of Pyle and,\n\nthus,   reject   the   appellants'   argument    that   the   prosecutor's\n\ncomplicity was a sine qua non of a Mooney claim in 1967.\n\n           Nor does the plaintiffs' inability to identify a pre-1967\n\nscenario that precisely mirrors the scandalous facts of this case\n\nensure the success of the appellants' claims of qualified immunity.\n\nThere is no requirement that the facts of previous cases be\n\nmaterially similar to the facts sub judice in order to trump a\n\nqualified immunity defense.      Hope, 536 U.S. at 739-41; Hall v.\n\nOchs, 817 F.2d 920, 925 (1st Cir. 1987).        General statements of the\n\nlaw are capable of conveying fair warning.          See United States v.\n\nLanier, 520 U.S. 259, 270-71 (1997); Davis v. Rennie, 264 F.3d 86,\n\n114 (1st Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 1053 (2002).                It\n\nfollows   logically     that,   in   some   situations,       \"a   general\n\nconstitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may\n\napply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question.\"\n\nLanier, 520 U.S. at 271.     So it is here.\n\n           That ends this phase of our archival journey into the\n\nannals of constitutional jurisprudence.            We conclude, without\n\nserious question, that Mooney and its pre-1967 progeny provided\n\nreasonable law enforcement officers fair warning that framing\n\ninnocent persons would violate the constitutional rights of the\n\nfalsely accused.\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\f                                     C\n\n          Since   the   relevant     right        and    rule   were    clearly\n\nestablished and the contours of the right were sufficiently well-\n\ndefined at the critical time (1967), we must proceed to the third\n\nand final step in the qualified immunity pavane.            This part of the\n\ninquiry   considers   whether   it       would    have   been   clear    to   an\n\nobjectively reasonable official, situated similarly to a particular\n\nappellant, that the actions taken or omitted contravened the\n\nclearly established right.      See Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202; Hatch,\n\n274 F.3d at 20; see also Anderson, 483 U.S. at 639 (emphasizing\n\nthat the standard is an objective one).           While the first two parts\n\nof the inquiry deal with abstract legal rules, the final step\n\ndepends on the facts of a given case.            Hatch, 274 F.3d at 24.\n\n          On an appeal from an order denying a motion to dismiss —\n\na situation in which the court of appeals is required to credit the\n\nallegations of the complaint — the first two steps will frequently\n\ngo a long way toward resolving the third.                   This case aptly\n\nillustrates that point.    Given the facts that are set out in the\n\namended complaints, we have scant difficulty in concluding that it\n\nshould have been transparently clear to a reasonable officer\n\nsituated similarly to either Condon or Walsh that his actions\n\nviolated the constitutional rights of Limone, Greco, and Tameleo.\n\n           We start with Condon. Both complaints allege that Condon\n\nwas reliably informed that Deegan had been executed by a crew that\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\fincluded    Joseph     Barboza,        Vincent    Flemmi,     Roy   French,      Ronald\n\nCassesso, and Joseph Martin; that he knew, based on conversations\n\nwith Barboza, that Barboza would commit perjury by swearing not\n\nonly that Flemmi had no involvement in the murder but also that\n\nthree innocent men (Limone, Greco, and Tameleo) had helped to\n\nperpetrate the crime; that he nonetheless developed Barboza as a\n\nwitness    and    turned    him    over    to    the    Suffolk     County      district\n\nattorney, knowing that Barboza's false testimony would be used to\n\nprosecute Limone, Greco, and Tameleo for a crime they did not\n\ncommit; that he failed to disclose exculpatory evidence before,\n\nduring, and after the trial; and that he interceded on Barboza's\n\nbehalf in a subsequent murder prosecution with a view toward\n\nensuring Barboza's continued silence and covering up his own\n\nmisdeeds.        It   is   plain    beyond      hope    of   contradiction       that   a\n\nreasonable officer, confronted with the same circumstances, would\n\nhave   understood      that     this    behavior       infracted    the   plaintiffs'\n\nconstitutional rights.\n\n            To be sure, Condon argues that he deserves qualified\n\nimmunity    in    spite    of     these   allegations        because      the    amended\n\ncomplaints describe vital reports as having been received by\n\nanother FBI agent (H. Paul Rico) and/or by the FBI's Boston office\n\n— not by Condon personally.               We do not think that this is an\n\nentirely fair characterization of the amended complaints.                        Even if\n\nit were, the plaintiffs, on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, are entitled to\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\fhave   all     plausible     inferences     drawn     in    their      favor.      See\n\nEducadores,     ___   F.3d    at   ___   [slip   op.   at     2];    LaChapelle     v.\n\nBerkshire Life Ins. Co., 142 F.3d 507, 508 (1st Cir. 1998).                        The\n\namended complaints reveal that Condon was stationed at the FBI's\n\nBoston office, that Rico was his partner, and that both were\n\nmembers   of    the   joint    federal-state        task     force     assembled    to\n\ninvestigate the murder.        These facts support a plausible inference\n\nthat the two shared the reports pertaining to the investigation.\n\n             The factual allegations anent Walsh are similar, although\n\nnot identical, to those involving Condon.                  Both complaints allege\n\nthat Walsh knew, based in part on inconsistent statements that he\n\ntook from Barboza, that Barboza would falsely attest that Limone,\n\nGreco,    and    Tameleo      murdered      Deegan;        that   he     nonetheless\n\nparticipated in the development of Barboza as a witness with\n\nrespect to the prosecution of the plaintiffs; that he failed to\n\ndisclose exculpatory evidence before, during, and after the trial\n\n(including a calendar allegedly furnished to him that would have\n\nprovided powerful support for Greco's alibi defense); and that he\n\nengaged in numerous artifices to conceal the identities of the\n\nactual killers.\n\n             Walsh labels these allegations \"conclusory\" and laments\n\nthat the amended complaints present no fact-specific averments\n\nshowing that he, as a municipal police officer, was privy to the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\finformation gleaned from FBI informants and interviews.         This\n\ncounterattack fails.\n\n           The factual allegations pertaining directly to Walsh,\n\ncombined with the plausible inferences that must be drawn in the\n\nplaintiffs' favor, suffice to survive a motion to dismiss.       See\n\nEducadores, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 2].    Walsh was an active\n\nmember of the joint federal-state task force — a fact that supports\n\na plausible inference that he was privy to information gathered by\n\nthe other members of the team (including Condon and Rico).        It\n\nshould have been obvious to a reasonable officer, confronted with\n\nthese circumstances, that this behavior abridged the plaintiffs'\n\nconstitutional rights.\n\n           In sum, we share the district court's view that, by 1967,\n\n\"[no] reasonable law enforcement officer would have thought it\n\npermissible to frame somebody for a crime he or she did not\n\ncommit.\"   Limone, 271 F. Supp. 2d at 365-66.     Taking the facts\n\nalleged in the amended complaints as true, we hold that neither\n\nappellant is entitled to qualified immunity at this juncture.    We\n\nadd, of course, that this ruling does not preclude the appellants\n\nfrom reasserting that defense, on a more fully developed record,\n\neither at summary judgment or at trial.\n\nIII.   THE FAVORABLE TERMINATION DEFENSE\n\n           Our work here is not done.   Limone succeeded in having\n\nhis conviction set aside in 2001, see Commonwealth v. Limone, 2001\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fWL 30494, at *8 (Mass. Super. Ct. 2001), and the district attorney\n\nsubsequently declined further prosecution.                Greco and Tameleo died\n\nin prison before they could secure similar remediation.                      In their\n\nmotions    to    dismiss,    the    appellants     argued      that    the   lack   of\n\nfavorable terminations precludes the Greco and Tameleo plaintiffs\n\nfrom pursuing their claims for damages.                See Heck v. Humphrey, 512\n\nU.S. 477, 486-87 (1994) (holding that a plaintiff, in order to\n\nrecover damages for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction, must\n\nshow   a   favorable      termination      of    the   underlying      conviction);\n\nFigueroa v. Rivera, 147 F.3d 77, 80 (1st Cir. 1998) (same).                         The\n\ndistrict court rejected this defense, holding that the Greco and\n\nTameleo plaintiffs could ride piggyback on the vacation of Limone's\n\nconviction to satisfy the favorable termination requirement under\n\na theory of \"constructive reversal,\" or in the alternative, that\n\nany    failure    to    secure     favorable     termination     was    excused      by\n\nallegations      of    \"government    wrongdoing       that   effectively      denied\n\naccess to post-conviction remedies.\"               Limone, 271 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n361.\n\n            The appellants ask us to review this determination here\n\nand now.     That request runs headlong into the general rule that\n\nonly final judgments and orders are immediately appealable in civil\n\ncases.     See Espinal-Dominguez v. Puerto Rico, 352 F.3d 490, 495\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1291).                    This rule admits of\n\nexceptions,      however,    and    one    judge-made     exception     allows      for\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\finterlocutory review of an order rejecting a qualified immunity\n\ndefense so long as the order turns on a purely legal question.\n\nSee, e.g., Stella, 63 F.3d at 73-74.              The appellants assert that we\n\nmay use this exception as a vehicle to review the Heck issue as\n\nwell.   We demur.\n\n              Federal courts long have recognized that interlocutory\n\nreview of a denial of qualified immunity \"does not in and of itself\n\nconfer jurisdiction over other contested issues in the case.\"\n\nRoque-Rodriguez v. Lema Moya, 926 F.2d 103, 105 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\nTo overcome this obstacle, the appellants invite us to embrace the\n\nseldom-used doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction.                See Swint\n\nv. Chambers County Comm'n, 514 U.S. 35, 50-51 (1995); Nieves-\n\nMárquez v. Puerto Rico, 353 F.3d 108, 123 (1st Cir. 2003).                       We\n\ndecline the invitation.\n\n              The     Supreme    Court      repeatedly    has    cautioned      that\n\nexceptions to the final judgment rule should be narrowly construed.\n\nSee, e.g., Digital Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S.\n\n863, 868 (1994).        In an effort to avoid needless encroachments on\n\nthe   final    judgment       rule,   we   have   been   quite   sparing   in   our\n\nendorsement of pendent appellate jurisdiction.                   See Fletcher v.\n\nTown of Clinton, 196 F.3d 41, 55 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that the\n\nexercise of         pendent   appellate      jurisdiction   is   \"discouraged\");\n\nRoque-Rodriguez, 926 F.2d at 105 n.2 (classifying this restraint as\n\n\"self-imposed\").        Thus, we have required that, at a bare minimum,\n\n\n                                           -23-\n\fa party promoting the exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction\n\ndemonstrate      either       that     the     pendent    issue       is   inextricably\n\nintertwined with the issue conferring the right of appeal or that\n\nreview of the pendent issue is essential to ensure meaningful\n\nreview of the linchpin issue.             See, e.g., Nieves-Márquez, 353 F.3d\n\nat 123; Suboh v. Dist. Atty's Office of the Suffolk Dist., 298 F.3d\n\n81, 97 (1st Cir. 2002); see also Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681,\n\n707 n.41 (1997).        Because these two considerations were limned by\n\nthe Court in Swint, 514 U.S. at 51, we sometimes refer to them as\n\nthe Swint criteria.\n\n              Here, the linchpin issue and the pendent issue cannot\n\nfairly   be    described          as   intertwined,       let    alone     inextricably\n\nintertwined.          Whereas the former (qualified immunity) focuses\n\nprincipally      on    the     appellants'          conduct     leading    up     to    the\n\nplaintiffs' convictions, the latter (favorable termination) entails\n\nan examination of post-conviction events. The fact that we already\n\nhave   conducted       an    exhaustive       review     of   the     district    court's\n\nqualified     immunity       ruling     without      needing     to    touch     upon   the\n\nfavorable termination issue, see supra Part II, makes manifest this\n\nlack of imbrication.              By the same token, it conclusively proves\n\nthat   the    exercise       of    pendent     appellate        jurisdiction      is    not\n\nessential to our ability to conduct meaningful review of the\n\nlinchpin issue.             On that score alone, this case is an unfit\n\ncandidate for the invocation of pendent appellate jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                             -24-\n\f             The appellants strive to parry this thrust by arguing\n\nthat failure to satisfy the Swint criteria should bar the exercise\n\nof pendent appellate jurisdiction only when the party appealing the\n\nlinchpin issue and the party appealing the pendent issue are\n\ndifferent.    They posit that where, as here, the same parties seek\n\nreview of both issues, pendent appellate jurisdiction may be\n\njustified on the basis of fairness and efficiency concerns.            See,\n\ne.g., Jungquist v. Sheikh Sultan Bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, 115 F.3d\n\n1020,   1026-27   (D.C.   Cir.   1997)    (exercising   pendent   appellate\n\njurisdiction on that basis when the same parties sought review of\n\nboth issues); Gilda Marx, Inc. v. Wildwood Exercise, Inc., 85 F.3d\n\n675, 679 & n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (declining to read fulfillment of\n\nthe Swint criteria as an absolute condition precedent to the\n\nexercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction).            They tell us that\n\nexercising pendent appellate jurisdiction in the instant case would\n\nallow for the early resolution of a potentially dispositive issue,\n\nthus catering to fairness and efficiency concerns.\n\n           We think that the appellants' position ignores reality.\n\nThere is no sound reason why the identity of the parties should\n\nhave decretory significance in deciding whether to exercise pendent\n\nappellate jurisdiction.     This court has used the Swint criteria as\n\nthe benchmark for pendent appellate jurisdiction in all sorts of\n\ncases, including cases in which the party appealing the pendent\n\nissue was also appealing the linchpin issue.            See, e.g., Nieves-\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fMárquez, 353 F.3d at 123; Suboh, 298 F.3d at 97.          So too the Second\n\nCircuit.   See Rein v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,\n\n162 F.3d 748, 757 (2d Cir. 1998) (stating that \"pendent issues\n\nraised by the party that has the right to bring an interlocutory\n\nappeal are at least as great a threat to the final-order scheme as\n\nare pendent issues raised by other parties\"). Several other courts\n\nof appeals have likewise endorsed a universal application of the\n\nSwint criteria.    See id. at 758 (collecting cases).          Consequently,\n\nwe hold explicitly that when a party who has the right to bring an\n\ninterlocutory appeal on one issue attempts simultaneously to raise\n\na second issue that ordinarily would be barred by the final\n\njudgment rule, we will not exercise appellate jurisdiction over the\n\npendent issue unless one of the Swint criteria is satisfied.\n\n           Given this paradigm, instances demanding the exercise of\n\npendent appellate     jurisdiction    are   likely   to   be   few   and   far\n\nbetween.   This is not one of them.     We conclude, therefore, that it\n\nwould be ultracrepidarian — and wrong — for us to exercise pendent\n\nappellate jurisdiction over the favorable termination issue just\n\nfor the Heck of it.\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We summarize succinctly.         At this early stage of the\n\nlitigation, the appellants have not demonstrated their entitlement\n\nto qualified immunity.     Because that is the only issue properly\n\nbefore us on these interlocutory appeals, we need go no further.\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -27-\n\f",

United States,</i> 271 F.Supp.2d 345, 349 (D.Mass.2003). The appellants exhort us to reverse that decree or, alternatively, to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over another (potentially dispositive) issue. We conclude that at this stage of the proceedings (i) the district court appropriately rejected the appellants' qualified immunity defenses, and (ii) the scope of these interlocutory appeals should not be broadened to encompass an unrelated issue. Consequently, we affirm the denial of qualified immunity and remand for further development of the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These appeals arise out of two separate but closely related suits, consolidated in the district court. An explication of the underlying facts requires the juridical equivalent of an archeological dig. The relevant events date back almost four decades to the 1965 murder of Edward \"Teddy\" Deegan and the 1968 convictions of several individuals, including Peter Limone, Louis Greco, and Henry Tameleo, for that slaying. Notwithstanding the jury's verdict and the subsequent rejection of their direct appeals, <i>see Commonwealth v. French,</i> 357 Mass. 356, 259 N.E.2d 195 (1970), the three men steadfastly maintained their innocence and mounted a campaign to clear their names. The facts, as now revealed, seemingly support their claims of innocence. The instant actions seek damages against those allegedly responsible for their wrongful convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For present purposes, the operative pleadings are the two amended complaints.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Those complaints are separate but similar. We compile the following account of the facts by reading the amended complaints in tandem, drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most agreeable to the plaintiffs (as the parties opposing the motions to dismiss). We note, however, that the district court recounted the factual allegations set out in the amended complaints at some length, <i>see Limone,</i> 271 F.Supp.2d at 349-53, and we urge those who hunger for greater detail to consult that rescript.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs &#8212; Limone (the only surviving member of the trio), the estates of Greco and Tameleo, and various relatives asserting derivative claims &#8212; have sued both a quondam agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and a retired Boston police officer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The amended complaints allege that the former FBI agent, Dennis Condon, and the former Boston detective, Frank L. Walsh, framed Limone, Greco, and Tameleo, assisted the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in wrongly convicting them on a charge of first-degree murder, participated in a coverup, and allowed the three innocent men to languish in prison for years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In relevant part, the complaints assert <i>Bivens</i> claims against Condon, <i>see Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the FBN,</i> 403 U.S. 388, 397, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and section 1983 claims against Walsh, <i>see</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000). The central theme of these claims is the accusation that Condon and Walsh, inter alias, violated the Constitution by developing one Joseph \"Baron\" Barboza as a witness for the prosecution in spite of their knowledge that Barboza would perjure himself and falsely implicate three innocent men in Deegan's murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Condon and Walsh (appellants here) moved to dismiss both amended complaints based on the doctrine of qualified immunity. They simultaneously moved to dismiss the suits brought on behalf of Greco and Tameleo on the ground that those plaintiffs had failed to satisfy the favorable termination requirement (described <i>infra</i> Part III) laid down by the Supreme Court in <i>Heck v. Humphrey,</i> 512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The district court rebuffed these initiatives. As to qualified immunity, the court found it inconceivable that, at the time of the relevant events, \"a reasonable law enforcement officer would have thought it permissible to frame somebody for a crime he or she did not commit.\" <i>Limone,</i> 271 F.Supp.2d at 365-66. As to <i>Heck,</i> the court found the favorable termination requirement satisfied vis-&#224;-vis the Greco and Tameleo plaintiffs on a theory of constructive reversal and, alternatively, on a theory of estoppel. <i>Id.</i> at 361. These timely appeals ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE QUALIFIED IMMUNITY DEFENSE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Condon and Walsh have appealed from the district court's order denying their motions to dismiss based on qualified immunity. An interlocutory appeal lies from such an order where, as here, qualified immunity turns on abstract legal questions. <i>Stella v. Kelley,</i> 63 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir.1995). We review the district court's order de novo, directing dismissal of the complaints \"only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.\" <i>Hishon v. King &amp; Spalding,</i> 467 U.S. 69, 73, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 81 L.Ed.2d 59 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with first principles. Qualified immunity is a judge-made doctrine. The elementary justification for the doctrine is that public officials performing discretionary functions should be free to act without fear of retributive suits for damages except when they should have understood that particular conduct was unlawful. <i>Davis v. Scherer,</i> 468 U.S. 183, 195, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 82 L.Ed.2d 139 (1984). That awareness depends, in large part, on the extent to which legal rules were clearly established when the official acted. <i>Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). It follows that an inquiry into the reasonableness of an officer's conduct must focus both on what the officer did (or failed to do) and on the state of the law at the time of the alleged act or omission. <i>Savard v. Rhode Island,</i> 338 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir.2003) (en banc), <i>cert. denied,</i> 540 U.S. 1109, 124 S.Ct. 1074, 157 L.Ed.2d 895 (2004); <i>Iacobucci v. Boulter,</i> 193 F.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir.1999). In the end, the qualified immunity defense should prevail unless the unlawfulness of the challenged conduct was \"apparent\" when undertaken. <i>Anderson v. Creighton,</i> 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although these appeals involve claims based on two different legal theories &#8212; <i>Bivens</i> and section 1983 &#8212; the analytical framework is, for our purposes, identical. <i>See Wilson v. Layne,</i> 526 U.S. 603, 609, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999). Drawing on Supreme Court precedent, <i>see, e.g., Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 200-02, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), we have developed a three-part algorithm for assessing whether a federal or state actor is entitled to qualified immunity. We consider (i) whether the plaintiff's allegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation; (ii) whether the constitutional right at issue was clearly established at the time of the putative violation; and (iii) whether a reasonable officer, situated similarly to the defendant, would have understood the challenged act or omission to contravene the discerned constitutional right. <i>Savard,</i> 338 F.3d at 27. More often than not, proper development of the law of qualified immunity is advanced if courts treat these three questions sequentially. <i>See Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151; <i>Fabiano v. Hopkins,</i> 352 F.3d 447, 453 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The threshold question in a qualified immunity appeal centers on the current state of the law. On a motion to dismiss, this question asks whether the facts alleged, viewed in the light most favorable to the complaining party, show that the officer's conduct violated some constitutional right. <i>Siegert v. Gilley,</i> 500 U.S. 226, 232-33, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991); <i>Santana v. Calderon,</i> 342 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir.2003). We turn directly to that question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amended complaints paint a sordid picture. Although the misdeeds described therein are many and varied, the plaintiffs' claims may be distilled into two basic allegations: first, that the appellants purposefully suborned false testimony from a key witness; and second, that the appellants suppressed exculpatory evidence in an effort both to cover up their own malefactions and to shield the actual murderers (one of whom was being groomed as an FBI informant). The complaints weave these allegations together. From that platform, the plaintiffs asseverate that an individual's right not to be convicted by these tawdry means &#8212; his right not to be framed by the government &#8212; is beyond doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is easy pickings. Although constitutional interpretation occasionally can prove recondite, some truths are self-evident. This is one such: if any concept is fundamental to our American system of justice, it is that those charged with upholding the law are prohibited from deliberately fabricating evidence and framing individuals for crimes they did not commit. <i>See, e.g., Devereaux v. Abbey,</i> 263 F.3d 1070, 1074-75 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc). Actions taken in contravention of this prohibition necessarily violate due process (indeed, we are unsure what due process entails if not protection against deliberate framing under color of official sanction). Thus, we resist the temptation to expound needlessly upon the first element in the qualified immunity catechism and simply pronounce that requirement satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second question in the algorithm asks whether the state of the law at the time of the putative violation afforded the defendant fair warning that his or her conduct was unconstitutional. <i>See Hope v. Pelzer,</i> 536 U.S. 730, 741, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002). In the circumstances of this case, that question requires us to determine whether the right not to be framed by law enforcement agents was clearly established in 1967 &#8212; the year in which the appellants are alleged to have started twisting their investigation to target the plaintiffs. We think that it was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From a jurisprudential perspective, our delving goes back some seventy years. In <i>Mooney v. Holohan,</i> 294 U.S. 103, 55 S.Ct. 340, 79 L.Ed. 791 (1935) (per curiam), the Supreme Court explained that due process</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">is a requirement that cannot be deemed to be satisfied by mere notice and hearing if a State has contrived a conviction through the pretense of a trial which in truth is but used as a means of depriving a defendant of liberty through a deliberate deception of court and jury by the presentation of testimony known to be perjured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 112, 55 S.Ct. 340. The following term, the Court reaffirmed that the Due Process Clause forbids convictions predicated on deliberate deceptions. <i>See Brown v. Mississippi,</i> 297 U.S. 278, 286, 56 S.Ct. 461, 80 L.Ed. 682 (1936). Six years later, the Court needed only a single paragraph and a citation to <i>Mooney</i> to buttress its conclusion that \"allegations that [the petitioner's] imprisonment resulted from perjured testimony, knowingly used by the State authorities to obtain his conviction, and from the deliberate suppression by those same authorities of evidence favorable to him ... sufficiently charge a deprivation of rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.\" <i>Pyle v. Kansas,</i> 317 U.S. 213, 216, 63 S.Ct. 177, 87 L.Ed. 214 (1942). Given these precedents, it is not surprising that, as early as 1951, this court described <i>Mooney's</i> core premise as \"well-settled.\" <i>Coggins v. O'Brien,</i> 188 F.2d 130, 138 (1st Cir.1951).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1959, the Supreme Court confirmed that the <i>Mooney</i> right covered circumstances in which \"the State, although not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it appears.\" <i>Napue v. Illinois,</i> 360 U.S. 264, 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959). In raising the bar to this modest level, the Court recognized that its prior case law \"established that a conviction obtained through use of false evidence, known to be such by representatives of the State, must fall under the Fourteenth Amendment.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Mooney</i>). The Court viewed such a right as \"implicit in any concept of ordered liberty.\" <i>Id.</i> And in 1967 &#8212; the very year that the violations in the instant case are alleged to have begun &#8212; Justice Stewart, writing for a unanimous Court, reiterated the point:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More than 30 years ago this Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment cannot tolerate a state criminal conviction obtained by the knowing use of false evidence. There has been no deviation from that established principle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Miller v. Pate,</i> 386 U.S. 1, 7, 87 S.Ct. 785, 17 L.Ed.2d 690 (1967) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants resist this impressive array of authority on two fronts. First, they accuse the plaintiffs and the district court of having defined the right in question too broadly. In their view, modeling the right as a right to be free from a contrived conviction &#8212; a right not to be framed by the government &#8212; casts too wide a net. They suggest instead that the plaintiffs' allegations should be squeezed into a more circumscribed mold and read as setting forth a <i>Brady</i> violation. <i>See Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) (holding that \"the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment\"). Having erected this straw man, the appellants then shred it: although <i>Brady</i> was decided prior to 1967, they assert that it was not clearly established then (indeed, it may not be clearly established today) that the duties imposed by <i>Brady</i> apply to law enforcement officers under circumstances in which the prosecutor is unaware of the contrivance. <i>See, e.g., Brady v. Dill,</i> 187 F.3d 104, 114 (1st Cir.1999) (suggesting that a law enforcement officer \"<i>sometimes</i> may be liable\" for a failure to reveal \"known exculpatory information\") (emphasis supplied); <i>Reid v. Simmons,</i> 163 F.Supp.2d 81, 84 (D.N.H.2001) (describing \"the circumstances under which police officers may be held civilly liable for <i>Brady</i> violations\" as \"a matter of considerable uncertainty\"), <i>aff'd,</i> 47 Fed. Appx. 5 (1st Cir.2002) (per curiam), <i>cert. denied,</i> 540 U.S. 894, 124 S.Ct. 237, 157 L.Ed.2d 170 (2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is certainly true that the manner in which a right is defined can make or break a qualified immunity defense. Courts must be careful not to permit an artful pleader to convert the doctrine of qualified immunity into a hollow safeguard simply by alleging a violation of an exceedingly nebulous right. <i>See Wilson,</i> 526 U.S. at 614-15, 119 S.Ct. 1692; <i>Hatch v. Dep't for Children, Youth &amp; Their Families,</i> 274 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir.2001). Courts must be equally careful, however, not to permit a defendant to hijack the plaintiff's complaint and recharacterize its allegations so as to minimize his or her liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the amended complaints, fairly read, are not susceptible to the appellants' animadversions. The right defined by the plaintiffs and recognized by the district court does not even approach the level of generality thought to be impermissible. <i>See, e.g., Anderson,</i> 483 U.S. at 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034 (discussing what level of generality is permissible with respect to due process violations); <i>Hatch,</i> 274 F.3d at 20 (same, with respect to \"the right to familial integrity\" and \"the parental interest in the care, custody, and control of children\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' argument has an even deeper flaw: it rests on a self-serving mischaracterization of the factual allegations set out in the amended complaints. The plaintiffs have not pleaded a <i>separate</i> claim that their rights were violated merely by the appellants' failure to divulge some discrete piece of <i>Brady</i> evidence. Rather, they have eschewed such a course in favor of a more sweeping accusation that the appellants actively participated in a plot to secure and sustain unjust convictions against innocent men. Though this scheme includes suballegations that occasionally involve <i>Brady</i> violations (e.g., suppression of exculpatory information), the overall charge cannot be shoehorned into the relatively narrow confines of the <i>Brady</i> rubric. As the district court put it, the \"individual allegations of non-disclosure\" are not meant to be self-sustaining, but, rather, \"are an integral part of the overall story.\" <i>Limone,</i> 271 F.Supp.2d at 366.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said before that \"[t]he sum of an evidentiary presentation may well be greater than its constituent parts.\" <i>N. Heel Corp. v. Compo Indus., Inc.,</i> 851 F.2d 456, 470 (1st Cir.1988) (quoting <i>Bourjaily v. United States,</i> 483 U.S. 171, 180, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987)). That aphorism is pertinent here. Taken as a whole, the unsavory enterprise chronicled in the amended complaints is too multifaceted to fit within the integument of the <i>Brady</i> right. In contrast, it fits comfortably within the more expansive contours of the right described in <i>Mooney.</i> To restrict the plaintiffs to a <i>Brady</i> claim would require us to disregard the forest and focus single-mindedly on a particular tree. The qualified immunity doctrine does not compel courts to take so myopic a view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants next attempt to tackle <i>Mooney</i> head-on. Even if <i>Mooney</i> furnishes the appropriate benchmark, this thesis runs, the circumstances in <i>Mooney</i> and its pre-1967 progeny are materially distinguishable from those alleged by the plaintiffs. According to the appellants, these were cases in which the falsity of the testimony was uncontroverted &#8212; not cases in which public officials simply pressed a view of the facts which, though ultimately proven wrong, was not obviously contrived. In a modest variation on this theme, the appellants add that, as of 1967, there was no clearly established right to be free from conviction based on testimony known only by law enforcement officers (and not by the prosecuting attorney) to be false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find these contentions unconvincing. The first, which at bottom challenges the sufficiency of the pleadings, is easily defeated. These appeals were brought following a decision on motions to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and, as such, all that is required is that the amended complaints allege acts sufficient to constitute framing and knowledge on the part of the appellants. <i>See Educadores Puertorrique&#241;os en Acci&#243;n v. Rey Hern&#225;ndez,</i> 367 F.3d 61 (1st Cir.2004) [No. 03-1588, slip op. at 12] (rejecting a heightened pleading standard for civil rights cases). While the plaintiffs eventually will have to adduce adequate evidence to support the claim that Condon and Walsh knew Barboza's story was apocryphal, their bare allegations of knowledge suffice at this embryonic stage of the proceedings. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' second contention fares no better. Although the amended complaints do not allege guilty knowledge on the part of the prosecuting attorney, no such averment is necessary to state an actionable claim. The duty that <i>Mooney</i> and its pre-1967 progeny established &#8212; a duty to refrain from procuring convictions by the presentation of testimony known to be perjurious &#8212; extended in 1967, as now, to law enforcement officers generally. The Supreme Court ascribed this duty broadly to the sovereign and its agents. <i>See, e.g., Napue,</i> 360 U.S. at 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173 (attributing the duty to \"representatives of the State\"); <i>Pyle,</i> 317 U.S. at 216, 63 S.Ct. 177 (attributing the duty to \"State authorities\"); <i>Mooney,</i> 294 U.S. at 112, 55 S.Ct. 340 (attributing the duty to \"the State\"). It strains credulity to suggest that FBI agents and police officers, duly sworn to uphold the law, do not fall within the compass of these proscriptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not the first court to reach this conclusion. Citing <i>Pyle,</i> the Fifth Circuit ruled to this effect in 1969. <i>See Smith v. Florida,</i> 410 F.2d 1349, 1350-51 (5th Cir.1969) (explaining that police violate the right described in <i>Mooney</i> if they suborn perjury even though they do so without the prosecutor's knowledge). Even more telling, the Third Circuit concluded in 1958 &#8212; nine years before Condon and Walsh are alleged to have embarked on their nefarious course of conduct &#8212; that <i>Pyle</i> had settled this very issue. <i>See Curran v. Delaware,</i> 259 F.2d 707, 713 (3d Cir.1958). An examination of the <i>Pyle</i> record disclosed to the Third Circuit's satisfaction \"that the prosecuting officer was in no wise a party to or cognizant of the perjured testimony given by certain witnesses of the State of Kansas or of the fact that the law enforcement officers had taken steps to procure false testimony favorable to the prosecution.\" <i>Id.</i> Although the prosecutor had been kept in the dark, the <i>Pyle</i> Court determined that the allegations, if true, would abridge the right described in <i>Mooney. See Pyle,</i> 317 U.S. at 216, 63 S.Ct. 177; <i>see also Curran,</i> 259 F.2d at 713 (relying on <i>Pyle,</i> reaching the identical conclusion, and finding such a violation). We agree with this interpretation of <i>Pyle</i> and, thus, reject the appellants' argument that the prosecutor's complicity was a sine qua non of a <i>Mooney</i> claim in 1967.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the plaintiffs' inability to identify a pre-1967 scenario that precisely mirrors the scandalous facts of this case ensure the success of the appellants' claims of qualified immunity. There is no requirement that the facts of previous cases be materially similar to the facts sub judice in order to trump a qualified immunity defense. <i>Hope,</i> 536 U.S. at 739-41, 122 S.Ct. 2508; <i>Hall v. Ochs,</i> 817 F.2d 920, 925 (1st Cir.1987). General statements of the law are capable of conveying fair warning. <i>See United States v. Lanier,</i> 520 U.S. 259, 270-71, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997); <i>Davis v. Rennie,</i> 264 F.3d 86, 114 (1st Cir.2001), <i>cert. denied,</i> 535 U.S. 1053, 122 S.Ct. 1909, 152 L.Ed.2d 820 (2002). It follows logically that, in some situations, \"a general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may apply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question.\" <i>Lanier,</i> 520 U.S. at 271, 117 S.Ct. 1219. So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this phase of our archival journey into the annals of constitutional jurisprudence. We conclude, without serious question, that <i>Mooney</i> and its pre-1967 progeny provided reasonable law enforcement officers fair warning that framing innocent persons would violate the constitutional rights of the falsely accused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the relevant right and rule were clearly established and the contours of the right were sufficiently well-defined at the critical time (1967), we must proceed to the third and final step in the qualified immunity pavane. This part of the inquiry considers whether it would have been clear to an objectively reasonable official, situated similarly to a particular appellant, that the actions taken or omitted contravened the clearly established right. <i>See Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151; <i>Hatch,</i> 274 F.3d at 20; <i>see also Anderson,</i> 483 U.S. at 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034 (emphasizing that the standard is an objective one). While the first two parts of the inquiry deal with abstract legal rules, the final step depends on the facts of a given case. <i>Hatch,</i> 274 F.3d at 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On an appeal from an order denying a motion to dismiss &#8212; a situation in which the court of appeals is required to credit the allegations of the complaint &#8212; the first two steps will frequently go a long way toward resolving the third. This case aptly illustrates that point. Given the facts that are set out in the amended complaints, we have scant difficulty in concluding that it should have been transparently clear to a reasonable officer situated similarly to either Condon or Walsh that his actions violated the constitutional rights of Limone, Greco, and Tameleo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with Condon. Both complaints allege that Condon was reliably informed that Deegan had been executed by a crew that included Joseph Barboza, Vincent Flemmi, Roy French, Ronald Cassesso, and Joseph Martin; that he knew, based on conversations with Barboza, that Barboza would commit perjury by swearing not only that Flemmi had no involvement in the murder but also that three innocent men (Limone, Greco, and Tameleo) had helped to perpetrate the crime; that he nonetheless developed Barboza as a witness and turned him over to the Suffolk County district attorney, knowing that Barboza's false testimony would be used to prosecute Limone, Greco, and Tameleo for a crime they did not commit; that he failed to disclose exculpatory evidence before, during, and after the trial; and that he interceded on Barboza's behalf in a subsequent murder prosecution with a view toward ensuring Barboza's continued silence and covering up his own misdeeds. It is plain beyond hope of contradiction that a reasonable officer, confronted with the same circumstances, would have understood that this behavior infracted the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Condon argues that he deserves qualified immunity in spite of these allegations because the amended complaints describe vital reports as having been received by another FBI agent (H. Paul Rico) and/or by the FBI's Boston office &#8212; not by Condon personally. We do not think that this is an entirely fair characterization of the amended complaints. Even if it were, the plaintiffs, on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, are entitled to have all plausible inferences drawn in their favor. <i>See Educadores,</i> 367 F.3d at 62 [slip op. at 2]; <i>LaChapelle v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co.,</i> 142 F.3d 507, 508 (1st Cir.1998). The amended complaints reveal that Condon was stationed at the FBI's Boston office, that Rico was his partner, and that both were members of the joint federal-state task force assembled to investigate the murder. These facts support a plausible inference that the two shared the reports pertaining to the investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factual allegations anent Walsh are similar, although not identical, to those involving Condon. Both complaints allege that Walsh knew, based in part on inconsistent statements that he took from Barboza, that Barboza would falsely attest that Limone, Greco, and Tameleo murdered Deegan; that he nonetheless participated in the development of Barboza as a witness with respect to the prosecution of the plaintiffs; that he failed to disclose exculpatory evidence before, during, and after the trial (including a calendar allegedly furnished to him that would have provided powerful support for Greco's alibi defense); and that he engaged in numerous artifices to conceal the identities of the actual killers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh labels these allegations \"conclusory\" and laments that the amended complaints present no fact-specific averments showing that he, as a municipal police officer, was privy to the information gleaned from FBI informants and interviews. This counterattack fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factual allegations pertaining directly to Walsh, combined with the plausible inferences that must be drawn in the plaintiffs' favor, suffice to survive a motion to dismiss. <i>See Educadores,</i> 367 F.3d at 62 [slip op. at 2]. Walsh was an active member of the joint federal-state task force &#8212; a fact that supports a plausible inference that he was privy to information gathered by the other members of the team (including Condon and Rico). It should have been obvious to a reasonable officer, confronted with these circumstances, that this behavior abridged the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we share the district court's view that, by 1967, \"[no] reasonable law enforcement officer would have thought it permissible to frame somebody for a crime he or she did not commit.\" <i>Limone,</i> 271 F.Supp.2d at 365-66. Taking the facts alleged in the amended complaints as true, we hold that neither appellant is entitled to qualified immunity at this juncture. We add, of course, that this ruling does not preclude the appellants from reasserting that defense, on a more fully developed record, either at summary judgment or at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE FAVORABLE TERMINATION DEFENSE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our work here is not done. Limone succeeded in having his conviction set aside in 2001, <i>see Commonwealth v. Limone,</i> 2001 WL 30494, at *8 (Mass.Super.Ct.2001), and the district attorney subsequently declined further prosecution. Greco and Tameleo died in prison before they could secure similar remediation. In their motions to dismiss, the appellants argued that the lack of favorable terminations precludes the Greco and Tameleo plaintiffs from pursuing their claims for damages. <i>See Heck v. Humphrey,</i> 512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) (holding that a plaintiff, in order to recover damages for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction, must show a favorable termination of the underlying conviction); <i>Figueroa v. Rivera,</i> 147 F.3d 77, 80 (1st Cir.1998) (same). The district court rejected this defense, holding that the Greco and Tameleo plaintiffs could ride piggyback on the vacation of Limone's conviction to satisfy the favorable termination requirement under a theory of \"constructive reversal,\" or in the alternative, that any failure to secure favorable termination was excused by allegations of \"government wrongdoing that effectively denied access to post-conviction remedies.\" <i>Limone,</i> 271 F.Supp.2d at 361.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants ask us to review this determination here and now. That request runs headlong into the general rule that only final judgments and orders are immediately appealable in civil cases. <i>See Espinal-Dominguez v. Puerto Rico,</i> 352 F.3d 490, 495 (1st Cir.2003) (citing 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291). This rule admits of exceptions, however, and one judge-made exception allows for interlocutory review of an order rejecting a qualified immunity defense so long as the order turns on a purely legal question. <i>See, e.g., Stella,</i> 63 F.3d at 73-74. The appellants assert that we may use this exception as a vehicle to review the <i>Heck</i> issue as well. We demur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts long have recognized that interlocutory review of a denial of qualified immunity \"does not in and of itself confer jurisdiction over other contested issues in the case.\" <i>Roque-Rodriguez v. Lema Moya,</i> 926 F.2d 103, 105 (1st Cir.1991). To overcome this obstacle, the appellants invite us to embrace the seldom-used doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction. <i>See Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n,</i> 514 U.S. 35, 50-51, 115 S.Ct. 1203, 131 L.Ed.2d 60 (1995); <i>Nieves-M&#225;rquez v. Puerto Rico,</i> 353 F.3d 108, 123 (1st Cir.2003). We decline the invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court repeatedly has cautioned that exceptions to the final judgment rule should be narrowly construed. <i>See, e.g., Digital Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc.,</i> 511 U.S. 863, 868, 114 S.Ct. 1992, 128 L.Ed.2d 842 (1994). In an effort to avoid needless encroachments on the final judgment rule, we have been quite sparing in our endorsement of pendent appellate jurisdiction. <i>See Fletcher v. Town of Clinton,</i> 196 F.3d 41, 55 (1st Cir.1999) (noting that the exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction is \"discouraged\"); <i>Roque-Rodriguez,</i> 926 F.2d at 105 n. 2 (classifying this restraint as \"self-imposed\"). Thus, we have required that, at a bare minimum, a party promoting the exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction demonstrate either that the pendent issue is inextricably intertwined with the issue conferring the right of appeal or that review of the pendent issue is essential to ensure meaningful review of the linchpin issue. <i>See, e.g., Nieves-M&#225;rquez,</i> 353 F.3d at 123; <i>Suboh v. Dist. Atty's Office of the Suffolk Dist.,</i> 298 F.3d 81, 97 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see also Clinton v. Jones,</i> 520 U.S. 681, 707 n. 41, 117 S.Ct. 1636, 137 L.Ed.2d 945 (1997). Because these two considerations were limned by the Court in <i>Swint,</i> 514 U.S. at 51, 115 S.Ct. 1203, we sometimes refer to them as the <i>Swint</i> criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the linchpin issue and the pendent issue cannot fairly be described as intertwined, let alone inextricably intertwined. Whereas the former (qualified immunity) focuses principally on the appellants' conduct leading up to the plaintiffs' convictions, the latter (favorable termination) entails an examination of post-conviction events. The fact that we already have conducted an exhaustive review of the district court's qualified immunity ruling without needing to touch upon the favorable termination issue, <i>see supra</i> Part II, makes manifest this lack of imbrication. By the same token, it conclusively proves that the exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction is not essential to our ability to conduct meaningful review of the linchpin issue. On that score alone, this case is an unfit candidate for the invocation of pendent appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants strive to parry this thrust by arguing that failure to satisfy the <i>Swint</i> criteria should bar the exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction only when the party appealing the linchpin issue and the party appealing the pendent issue are different. They posit that where, as here, the same parties seek review of both issues, pendent appellate jurisdiction may be justified on the basis of fairness and efficiency concerns. <i>See, e.g., Jungquist v. Sheikh Sultan Bin Khalifa Al Nahyan,</i> 115 F.3d 1020, 1026-27 (D.C.Cir.1997) (exercising pendent appellate jurisdiction on that basis when the same parties sought review of both issues); <i>Gilda Marx, Inc. v. Wildwood Exercise, Inc.,</i> 85 F.3d 675, 679 &amp; n. 4 (D.C.Cir.1996) (declining to read fulfillment of the <i>Swint</i> criteria as an absolute condition precedent to the exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction). They tell us that exercising pendent appellate jurisdiction in the instant case would allow for the early resolution of a potentially dispositive issue, thus catering to fairness and efficiency concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that the appellants' position ignores reality. There is no sound reason why the identity of the parties should have decretory significance in deciding whether to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction. This court has used the <i>Swint</i> criteria as the benchmark for pendent appellate jurisdiction in all sorts of cases, including cases in which the party appealing the pendent issue was also appealing the linchpin issue. <i>See, e.g., Nieves-M&#225;rquez,</i> 353 F.3d at 123; <i>Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 97. So too the Second Circuit. <i>See Rein v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,</i> 162 F.3d 748, 757 (2d Cir.1998) (stating that \"pendent issues raised by the party that has the right to bring an interlocutory appeal are at least as great a threat to the final-order scheme as are pendent issues raised by other parties\"). Several other courts of appeals have likewise endorsed a universal application of the <i>Swint</i> criteria. <i>See id.</i> at 758 (collecting cases). Consequently, we hold explicitly that when a party who has the right to bring an interlocutory appeal on one issue attempts simultaneously to raise a second issue that ordinarily would be barred by the final judgment rule, we will not exercise appellate jurisdiction over the pendent issue unless one of the <i>Swint</i> criteria is satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this paradigm, instances demanding the exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction are likely to be few and far between. This is not one of them. We conclude, therefore, that it would be ultracrepidarian &#8212; and wrong &#8212; for us to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over the favorable termination issue just for the <i>Heck</i> of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize succinctly. At this early stage of the litigation, the appellants have not demonstrated their entitlement to qualified immunity. Because that is the only issue properly before us on these interlocutory appeals, we need go no further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> The Honorable John R.

The appellants exhort us to reverse that decree or, alternatively, to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over another (potentially dispositive) issue. We conclude that at this stage of the proceedings (i) the district court appropriately rejected the appellants' qualified immunity defenses, and (ii) the scope of these interlocutory appeals should not be broadened to encompass an unrelated issue. Consequently, we affirm the denial of qualified immunity and remand for further development of the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These appeals arise out of two separate but closely related suits, consolidated in the district court. An explication of the underlying facts requires the juridical equivalent of an archeological dig. The relevant events date back almost four decades to the 1965 murder of Edward \"Teddy\" Deegan and the 1968 convictions of several individuals, including Peter Limone, Louis Greco, and Henry Tameleo, for that slaying. Notwithstanding the jury's verdict and the subsequent rejection of their direct appeals, <i>see Commonwealth v. French,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2059475\"><a href=\"/opinion/2059475/commonwealth-v-french/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2059475\"><a href=\"/opinion/2059475/commonwealth-v-french/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span> (1970), the three men steadfastly maintained their innocence and mounted a campaign to clear their names. The facts, as now revealed, seemingly support their claims of innocence. The instant actions seek damages against those allegedly responsible for their wrongful convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For present purposes, the operative pleadings are the two amended complaints.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Those complaints are separate but similar. We compile the following account of the facts by reading the amended complaints in tandem, drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most agreeable to the plaintiffs (as the parties opposing the motions to dismiss). We note, however, that the district court recounted the factual allegations set out in the amended complaints at some length, <i>see Limone,</i> 271 F.Supp.2d at 349-53, and we urge those who hunger for greater detail to consult that rescript.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs &#8212; Limone (the only surviving member of the trio), the estates of Greco and Tameleo, and various relatives asserting derivative claims &#8212; have sued both a quondam agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and a retired Boston police officer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The amended complaints allege that the former FBI agent, Dennis Condon, and the former Boston detective, Frank L.

Qualified immunity is a judge-made doctrine. The elementary justification for the doctrine is that public officials performing discretionary functions should be free to act without fear of retributive suits for damages except when they should have understood that particular conduct was unlawful. <i>Davis v. Scherer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111241\"><a href=\"/opinion/111241/davis-v-scherer/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 195, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111241\"><a href=\"/opinion/111241/davis-v-scherer/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We consider (i) whether the plaintiff's allegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation; (ii) whether the constitutional right at issue was clearly established at the time of the putative violation; and (iii) whether a reasonable officer, situated similarly to the defendant, would have understood the challenged act or omission to contravene the discerned constitutional right. <i>Savard,</i> 338 F.3d at 27. More often than not, proper development of the law of qualified immunity is advanced if courts treat these three questions sequentially. <i>See Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 201, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We turn directly to that question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amended complaints paint a sordid picture. Although the misdeeds described therein are many and varied, the plaintiffs' claims may be distilled into two basic allegations: first, that the appellants purposefully suborned false testimony from a key witness; and second, that the appellants suppressed exculpatory evidence in an effort both to cover up their own malefactions and to shield the actual murderers (one of whom was being groomed as an FBI informant). The complaints weave these allegations together. From that platform, the plaintiffs asseverate that an individual's right not to be convicted by these tawdry means &#8212; his right not to be framed by the government &#8212; is beyond doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is easy pickings. Although constitutional interpretation occasionally can prove recondite, some truths are self-evident. This is one such: if any concept is fundamental to our American system of justice, it is that those charged with upholding the law are prohibited from deliberately fabricating evidence and framing individuals for crimes they did not commit. <i>See, e.g., Devereaux v. Abbey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774782\"><a href=\"/opinion/774782/robert-devereaux-v-timothy-david-abbey-laurie-alexander-kate-carrow-linda/\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span></a></span>, 1074-75 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc). Actions taken in contravention of this prohibition necessarily violate due process (indeed, we are unsure what due process entails if not protection against deliberate framing under color of official sanction). Thus, we resist the temptation to expound needlessly upon the first element in the qualified immunity catechism and simply pronounce that requirement satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second question in the algorithm asks whether the state of the law at the time of the putative violation afforded the defendant fair warning that his or her conduct was unconstitutional. <i>See Hope v. Pelzer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121169\"><a href=\"/opinion/121169/hope-v-pelzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span>, 741, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121169\"><a href=\"/opinion/121169/hope-v-pelzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In the circumstances of this case, that question requires us to determine whether the right not to be framed by law enforcement agents was clearly established in 1967 &#8212; the year in which the appellants are alleged to have started twisting their investigation to target the plaintiffs.

First, they accuse the plaintiffs and the district court of having defined the right in question too broadly. In their view, modeling the right as a right to be free from a contrived conviction &#8212; a right not to be framed by the government &#8212; casts too wide a net. They suggest instead that the plaintiffs' allegations should be squeezed into a more circumscribed mold and read as setting forth a <i>Brady</i> violation. <i>See Brady v.

Having erected this straw man, the appellants then shred it: although <i>Brady</i> was decided prior to 1967, they assert that it was not clearly established then (indeed, it may not be clearly established today) that the duties imposed by <i>Brady</i> apply to law enforcement officers under circumstances in which the prosecutor is unaware of the contrivance. <i>See, e.g., Brady v.

Courts must be careful not to permit an artful pleader to convert the doctrine of qualified immunity into a hollow safeguard simply by alleging a violation of an exceedingly nebulous right. <i>See Wilson,</i> 526 U.S. at 614-15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118289\"><a href=\"/opinion/118289/wilson-v-layne/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The right defined by the plaintiffs and recognized by the district court does not even approach the level of generality thought to be impermissible. <i>See, e.g., Anderson,</i> 483 U.S. at 639, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The plaintiffs have not pleaded a <i>separate</i> claim that their rights were violated merely by the appellants' failure to divulge some discrete piece of <i>Brady</i> evidence. Rather, they have eschewed such a course in favor of a more sweeping accusation that the appellants actively participated in a plot to secure and sustain unjust convictions against innocent men. Though this scheme includes suballegations that occasionally involve <i>Brady</i> violations (e.g., suppression of exculpatory information), the overall charge cannot be shoehorned into the relatively narrow confines of the <i>Brady</i> rubric. As the district court put it, the \"individual allegations of non-disclosure\" are not meant to be self-sustaining, but, rather, \"are an integral part of the overall story.\" <i>Limone,</i> 271 F.Supp.2d at 366.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said before that \"[t]he sum of an evidentiary presentation may well be greater than its constituent parts.\" <i>N.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span> (1987)). That aphorism is pertinent here. Taken as a whole, the unsavory enterprise chronicled in the amended complaints is too multifaceted to fit within the integument of the <i>Brady</i> right. In contrast, it fits comfortably within the more expansive contours of the right described in <i>Mooney.</i> To restrict the plaintiffs to a <i>Brady</i> claim would require us to disregard the forest and focus single-mindedly on a particular tree. The qualified immunity doctrine does not compel courts to take so myopic a view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants next attempt to tackle <i>Mooney</i> head-on. Even if <i>Mooney</i> furnishes the appropriate benchmark, this thesis runs, the circumstances in <i>Mooney</i> and its pre-1967 progeny are materially distinguishable from those alleged by the plaintiffs. According to the appellants, these were cases in which the falsity of the testimony was uncontroverted &#8212; not cases in which public officials simply pressed a view of the facts which, though ultimately proven wrong, was not obviously contrived. In a modest variation on this theme, the appellants add that, as of 1967, there was no clearly established right to be free from conviction based on testimony known only by law enforcement officers (and not by the prosecuting attorney) to be false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find these contentions unconvincing. The first, which at bottom challenges the sufficiency of the pleadings, is easily defeated. These appeals were brought following a decision on motions to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and, as such, all that is required is that the amended complaints allege acts sufficient to constitute framing and knowledge on the part of the appellants. <i>See Educadores Puertorrique&#241;os en Acci&#243;n v. Rey Hern&#225;ndez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200999\"><a href=\"/opinion/200999/epa-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2004) [No. 03-1588, slip op. at 12] (rejecting a heightened pleading standard for civil rights cases). While the plaintiffs eventually will have to adduce adequate evidence to support the claim that Condon and Walsh knew Barboza's story was apocryphal, their bare allegations of knowledge suffice at this embryonic stage of the proceedings. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' second contention fares no better. Although the amended complaints do not allege guilty knowledge on the part of the prosecuting attorney, no such averment is necessary to state an actionable claim. The duty that <i>Mooney</i> and its pre-1967 progeny established &#8212; a duty to refrain from procuring convictions by the presentation of testimony known to be perjurious &#8212; extended in 1967, as now, to law enforcement officers generally. The Supreme Court ascribed this duty broadly to the sovereign and its agents. <i>See, e.g., Napue,</i> 360 U.S. at 269, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105912\"><a href=\"/opinion/105912/napue-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Citing <i>Pyle,</i> the Fifth Circuit ruled to this effect in 1969. <i>See Smith v. Florida,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"284871\"><a href=\"/opinion/284871/william-francis-smith-v-state-of-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1349</span></a></span>, 1350-51 (5th Cir.1969) (explaining that police violate the right described in <i>Mooney</i> if they suborn perjury even though they do so without the prosecutor's knowledge). Even more telling, the Third Circuit concluded in 1958 &#8212; nine years before Condon and Walsh are alleged to have embarked on their nefarious course of conduct &#8212; that <i>Pyle</i> had settled this very issue. <i>See Curran v. Delaware,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"246192\"><a href=\"/opinion/246192/francis-j-curran-francis-j-maguire-and-ira-f-jones-jr-v-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 713 (3d Cir.1958). An examination of the <i>Pyle</i> record disclosed to the Third Circuit's satisfaction \"that the prosecuting officer was in no wise a party to or cognizant of the perjured testimony given by certain witnesses of the State of Kansas or of the fact that the law enforcement officers had taken steps to procure false testimony favorable to the prosecution.\" <i>Id.</i> Although the prosecutor had been kept in the dark, the <i>Pyle</i> Court determined that the allegations, if true, would abridge the right described in <i>Mooney. See Pyle,</i> 317 U.S. at 216, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></span>; <i>see also Curran,</i> 259 F.2d at 713 (relying on <i>Pyle,</i> reaching the identical conclusion, and finding such a violation). We agree with this interpretation of <i>Pyle</i> and, thus, reject the appellants' argument that the prosecutor's complicity was a sine qua non of a <i>Mooney</i> claim in 1967.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the plaintiffs' inability to identify a pre-1967 scenario that precisely mirrors the scandalous facts of this case ensure the success of the appellants' claims of qualified immunity. There is no requirement that the facts of previous cases be materially similar to the facts sub judice in order to trump a qualified immunity defense. <i>Hope,</i> 536 U.S. at 739-41, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121169\"><a href=\"/opinion/121169/hope-v-pelzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This part of the inquiry considers whether it would have been clear to an objectively reasonable official, situated similarly to a particular appellant, that the actions taken or omitted contravened the clearly established right. <i>See Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 202, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3034</span></a></span> (emphasizing that the standard is an objective one). While the first two parts of the inquiry deal with abstract legal rules, the final step depends on the facts of a given case. <i>Hatch,</i> 274 F.3d at 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On an appeal from an order denying a motion to dismiss &#8212; a situation in which the court of appeals is required to credit the allegations of the complaint &#8212; the first two steps will frequently go a long way toward resolving the third. This case aptly illustrates that point. Given the facts that are set out in the amended complaints, we have scant difficulty in concluding that it should have been transparently clear to a reasonable officer situated similarly to either Condon or Walsh that his actions violated the constitutional rights of Limone, Greco, and Tameleo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with Condon. Both complaints allege that Condon was reliably informed that Deegan had been executed by a crew that included Joseph Barboza, Vincent Flemmi, Roy French, Ronald Cassesso, and Joseph Martin; that he knew, based on conversations with Barboza, that Barboza would commit perjury by swearing not only that Flemmi had no involvement in the murder but also that three innocent men (Limone, Greco, and Tameleo) had helped to perpetrate the crime; that he nonetheless developed Barboza as a witness and turned him over to the Suffolk County district attorney, knowing that Barboza's false testimony would be used to prosecute Limone, Greco, and Tameleo for a crime they did not commit; that he failed to disclose exculpatory evidence before, during, and after the trial; and that he interceded on Barboza's behalf in a subsequent murder prosecution with a view toward ensuring Barboza's continued silence and covering up his own misdeeds. It is plain beyond hope of contradiction that a reasonable officer, confronted with the same circumstances, would have understood that this behavior infracted the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Condon argues that he deserves qualified immunity in spite of these allegations because the amended complaints describe vital reports as having been received by another FBI agent (H. Paul Rico) and/or by the FBI's Boston office &#8212; not by Condon personally. We do not think that this is an entirely fair characterization of the amended complaints. Even if it were, the plaintiffs, on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, are entitled to have all plausible inferences drawn in their favor. <i>See Educadores,</i> 367 F.3d at 62 [slip op. at 2]; <i>LaChapelle v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197923\"><a href=\"/opinion/197923/lachapelle-v-berkshire-life/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 508 (1st Cir.1998). The amended complaints reveal that Condon was stationed at the FBI's Boston office, that Rico was his partner, and that both were members of the joint federal-state task force assembled to investigate the murder. These facts support a plausible inference that the two shared the reports pertaining to the investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factual allegations anent Walsh are similar, although not identical, to those involving Condon. Both complaints allege that Walsh knew, based in part on inconsistent statements that he took from Barboza, that Barboza would falsely attest that Limone, Greco, and Tameleo murdered Deegan; that he nonetheless participated in the development of Barboza as a witness with respect to the prosecution of the plaintiffs; that he failed to disclose exculpatory evidence before, during, and after the trial (including a calendar allegedly furnished to him that would have provided powerful support for Greco's alibi defense); and that he engaged in numerous artifices to conceal the identities of the actual killers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh labels these allegations \"conclusory\" and laments that the amended complaints present no fact-specific averments showing that he, as a municipal police officer, was privy to the information gleaned from FBI informants and interviews. This counterattack fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factual allegations pertaining directly to Walsh, combined with the plausible inferences that must be drawn in the plaintiffs' favor, suffice to survive a motion to dismiss. <i>See Educadores,</i> 367 F.3d at 62 [slip op. at 2]. Walsh was an active member of the joint federal-state task force &#8212; a fact that supports a plausible inference that he was privy to information gathered by the other members of the team (including Condon and Rico). It should have been obvious to a reasonable officer, confronted with these circumstances, that this behavior abridged the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we share the district court's view that, by 1967, \"[no] reasonable law enforcement officer would have thought it permissible to frame somebody for a crime he or she did not commit.\" <i>Limone,</i> 271 F.Supp.2d at 365-66. Taking the facts alleged in the amended complaints as true, we hold that neither appellant is entitled to qualified immunity at this juncture. We add, of course, that this ruling does not preclude the appellants from reasserting that defense, on a more fully developed record, either at summary judgment or at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE FAVORABLE TERMINATION DEFENSE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our work here is not done. Limone succeeded in having his conviction set aside in 2001, <i>see Commonwealth v.

Greco and Tameleo died in prison before they could secure similar remediation. In their motions to dismiss, the appellants argued that the lack of favorable terminations precludes the Greco and Tameleo plaintiffs from pursuing their claims for damages. <i>See Heck v. Humphrey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117864\"><a href=\"/opinion/117864/heck-v-humphrey/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span>, 486-87, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117864\"><a href=\"/opinion/117864/heck-v-humphrey/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court rejected this defense, holding that the Greco and Tameleo plaintiffs could ride piggyback on the vacation of Limone's conviction to satisfy the favorable termination requirement under a theory of \"constructive reversal,\" or in the alternative, that any failure to secure favorable termination was excused by allegations of \"government wrongdoing that effectively denied access to post-conviction remedies.\" <i>Limone,</i> 271 F.Supp.2d at 361.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants ask us to review this determination here and now. That request runs headlong into the general rule that only final judgments and orders are immediately appealable in civil cases. <i>See Espinal-Dominguez v.

This rule admits of exceptions, however, and one judge-made exception allows for interlocutory review of an order rejecting a qualified immunity defense so long as the order turns on a purely legal question. <i>See, e.g., Stella,</i> 63 F.3d at 73-74. The appellants assert that we may use this exception as a vehicle to review the <i>Heck</i> issue as well. We demur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts long have recognized that interlocutory review of a denial of qualified immunity \"does not in and of itself confer jurisdiction over other contested issues in the case.\" <i>Roque-Rodriguez v.

We decline the invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court repeatedly has cautioned that exceptions to the final judgment rule should be narrowly construed. <i>See, e.g., Digital Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087952\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087952/digital-equipment-corp-v-desktop-direct-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">863</span></a></span>, 868, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087952\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087952/digital-equipment-corp-v-desktop-direct-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1992</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087952\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087952/digital-equipment-corp-v-desktop-direct-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">842</span></a></span> (1994). In an effort to avoid needless encroachments on the final judgment rule, we have been quite sparing in our endorsement of pendent appellate jurisdiction. <i>See Fletcher v. Town of Clinton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198711\"><a href=\"/opinion/198711/fletcher-v-clinton/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.1999) (noting that the exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction is \"discouraged\"); <i>Roque-Rodriguez,</i> 926 F.2d at 105 n. 2 (classifying this restraint as \"self-imposed\"). Thus, we have required that, at a bare minimum, a party promoting the exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction demonstrate either that the pendent issue is inextricably intertwined with the issue conferring the right of appeal or that review of the pendent issue is essential to ensure meaningful review of the linchpin issue. <i>See, e.g., Nieves-M&#225;rquez,</i> 353 F.3d at 123; <i>Suboh v. Dist. Atty's Office of the Suffolk Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></span>, 97 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see also Clinton v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118115\"><a href=\"/opinion/118115/clinton-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span>, 707 n. 41, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118115\"><a href=\"/opinion/118115/clinton-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1636</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118115\"><a href=\"/opinion/118115/clinton-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">945</span></a></span> (1997). Because these two considerations were limned by the Court in <i>Swint,</i> 514 U.S. at 51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117906\"><a href=\"/opinion/117906/swint-v-chambers-county-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1203</span></a></span>, we sometimes refer to them as the <i>Swint</i> criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the linchpin issue and the pendent issue cannot fairly be described as intertwined, let alone inextricably intertwined. Whereas the former (qualified immunity) focuses principally on the appellants' conduct leading up to the plaintiffs' convictions, the latter (favorable termination) entails an examination of post-conviction events. The fact that we already have conducted an exhaustive review of the district court's qualified immunity ruling without needing to touch upon the favorable termination issue, <i>see supra</i> Part II, makes manifest this lack of imbrication. By the same token, it conclusively proves that the exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction is not essential to our ability to conduct meaningful review of the linchpin issue. On that score alone, this case is an unfit candidate for the invocation of pendent appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants strive to parry this thrust by arguing that failure to satisfy the <i>Swint</i> criteria should bar the exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction only when the party appealing the linchpin issue and the party appealing the pendent issue are different. They posit that where, as here, the same parties seek review of both issues, pendent appellate jurisdiction may be justified on the basis of fairness and efficiency concerns. <i>See, e.g., Jungquist v. Sheikh Sultan Bin Khalifa Al Nahyan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741856\"><a href=\"/opinion/741856/tara-ann-jungquist-v-sheikh-sultan-bin-khalifa-al-nahyan/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1020</span></a></span>, 1026-27 (D.C.Cir.1997) (exercising pendent appellate jurisdiction on that basis when the same parties sought review of both issues); <i>Gilda Marx, Inc. v. Wildwood Exercise, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"719589\"><a href=\"/opinion/719589/gilda-marx-incorporated-body-design-by-gilda-inc-body-design-by-gilda/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span>, 679 &amp; n. 4 (D.C.Cir.1996) (declining to read fulfillment of the <i>Swint</i> criteria as an absolute condition precedent to the exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction). They tell us that exercising pendent appellate jurisdiction in the instant case would allow for the early resolution of a potentially dispositive issue, thus catering to fairness and efficiency concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that the appellants' position ignores reality. There is no sound reason why the identity of the parties should have decretory significance in deciding whether to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction. This court has used the <i>Swint</i> criteria as the benchmark for pendent appellate jurisdiction in all sorts of cases, including cases in which the party appealing the pendent issue was also appealing the linchpin issue. <i>See, e.g., Nieves-M&#225;rquez,</i> 353 F.3d at 123; <i>Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 97. So too the Second Circuit. <i>See Rein v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759754\"><a href=\"/opinion/759754/denice-h-rein-individually-and-as-of-the-estate-of-mark-alan-rein/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span>, 757 (2d Cir.1998) (stating that \"pendent issues raised by the party that has the right to bring an interlocutory appeal are at least as great a threat to the final-order scheme as are pendent issues raised by other parties\"). Several other courts of appeals have likewise endorsed a universal application of the <i>Swint</i> criteria. <i>See id.</i> at 758 (collecting cases). Consequently, we hold explicitly that when a party who has the right to bring an interlocutory appeal on one issue attempts simultaneously to raise a second issue that ordinarily would be barred by the final judgment rule, we will not exercise appellate jurisdiction over the pendent issue unless one of the <i>Swint</i> criteria is satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this paradigm, instances demanding the exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction are likely to be few and far between. This is not one of them. We conclude, therefore, that it would be ultracrepidarian &#8212; and wrong &#8212; for us to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over the favorable termination issue just for the <i>Heck</i> of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize succinctly. At this early stage of the litigation, the appellants have not demonstrated their entitlement to qualified immunity. Because that is the only issue properly before us on these interlocutory appeals, we need go no further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> The Honorable John R. Gibson, of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There are two suits rather than three because Limone and Tameleo's heirs and personal representatives joined in the filing of a single action. Greco's executrix and heirs chose to sue separately</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs actually sought damages against several other parties as well, asserting a salmagundi of federal and state-law theories<i>See Limone,</i> 271 F.Supp.2d at 348 n. 3 (identifying the defendants and delineating the claims). One such party, former FBI agent H. Paul Rico, died on January 16, 2004. When no personal representative came forward on his behalf, we dismissed his pending appeal without prejudice. The other defendants are not parties to these interlocutory appeals.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Although a Massachusetts state court judge originally sentenced the trio to death, the United States Supreme Court subsequently vacated that disposition<i>See, e.g., Limone v. Massachusetts,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">936</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
