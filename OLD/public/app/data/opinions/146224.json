Hertz, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Rosa E.\nRodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, District of Puerto Rico,\nwere on brief for appellee/cross-appellant.\n\n\n\n                           May 11, 2010\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.         Plaintiff-appellant/cross-\n\nappellee Angel David Morales-Vallellanes (\"Morales\") obtained a\n\njury verdict in his favor on claims under Title VII alleging\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation by his former employer, John E.\n\nPotter, the United States Postmaster General (\"Potter\").                 In a\n\nprior appeal, we limited Morales to pursuing claims based on three\n\ndiscrete incidents that were previously the subject of formal Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaints, and expressly\n\nprecluded    him   from   seeking   relief   for   a   \"plethora\"   of   other\n\nallegations raised for the first time in the district court.              See\n\nMorales-Vallellanes v. Potter, 339 F.3d 9, 19 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n[hereinafter \"Morales I\"].      Despite this limitation, the evidence\n\npresented at trial included numerous allegations of discrimination\n\nand retaliation that were well beyond the scope of our limited\n\nremand.     Nonetheless, the jury was instructed that Morales could\n\nonly recover for his claims based on the three specific allegations\n\naddressed in the prior appeal.          On December 21, 2007, the jury\n\nreturned a $500,000 lump-sum verdict in his favor, which was later\n\nreduced by way of statutory cap to $300,000.           See 42 U.S.C. § 1981a\n\n(b)(3)(D).    The trial court awarded an additional $64,504 in back\n\npay.\n\n            Morales brought this appeal to challenge the sufficiency\n\nof the trial court's back pay award, as well as its decision\n\ndenying him front pay.      On cross appeal, Potter contends that the\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fjury verdict cannot stand because Morales failed to prove that he\n\nsuffered   any   materially    adverse       employment    action    capable   of\n\nsupporting his claims under Title VII.              Potter also challenges the\n\njury's damages award as grossly excessive and based on evidence\n\nthat we previously excluded; contends that Morales was not entitled\n\nto back pay; and in various ways opposes Morales's contentions that\n\nhis damages award was inadequate.\n\n            After careful consideration, we conclude as a matter of\n\nlaw that Morales has failed to prove that he suffered any material\n\nadverse    employment     action    within    the    meaning    of   Title   VII's\n\ndiscrimination or retaliation provisions.              We therefore vacate the\n\njury verdict and remand with instructions to enter judgment in\n\nPotter's favor.\n\n                               I.    Background\n\n            A.   Facts1\n\n            We sketch only the basic facts essential to this appeal.\n\nMorales began his employment with the United States Postal Service\n\n(\"USPS\") in 1988 as a Distribution Clerk.                      In 1990, he was\n\ntransferred to the USPS station in Caparra Heights, Puerto Rico.\n\nIn 1995, Morales bid for and obtained the position of Distribution\n\nand Window Clerk.       In this capacity, Morales typically performed\n\nback-office \"distribution\" duties, which included \"business reply,\"\n\n\n\n1\n   Additional detail regarding Morales's allegations can be found\nin our prior opinion. See Morales I, 339 F.3d at 12-14.\n\n                                      -3-\n\f\"express mail,\" and \"postage due\" functions.                     Because Morales\n\nworked the early shift and had an arm injury that limited the tasks\n\nhe could perform without pain, Morales rarely performed \"window\"\n\nduties, which included customer interactions; nonetheless, he was\n\ntrained to do so, did so on occasion, and those tasks were part of\n\nthe job description he had bid for.\n\n           Beginning in approximately early 1996, Morales lodged\n\nseveral   complaints     with        the   Occupational       Safety   and    Health\n\nAdministration       (OSHA)     regarding          dust    accumulation,      rodent\n\ninfestation, and general unsanitary conditions at the Caparra\n\nHeights station.      Eventually, OSHA conducted a formal inspection\n\nand   issued   the   USPS     citations      for    various   safety   and    health\n\nviolations.    Around the same time, Morales also filed unrelated,\n\nemployment-based complaints with the EEOC.                  Morales alleged that\n\nhis supervisors and coworkers began to take various retaliatory\n\nactions   against     him      for     filing      these    complaints,      and   to\n\ndiscriminate against him on account of his gender. Only three such\n\nactions are relevant to this appeal.\n\n           First, in January 1996 Morales expressed interest in\n\nbidding for a Distribution and Window Clerk position that was\n\nexpected to come with Saturdays and Sundays off, a coveted position\n\ngiven that many USPS employees had an irregular weekend schedule.2\n\n\n2\n   At the time, Morales had Sundays and Mondays off.    Morales\ntestified that at some point in 1996, he was given Saturday and\nSundays off instead.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fThereafter, the USPS reclassified the position so that, when it was\n\nposted, it came with Thursdays and Sundays off instead.           On\n\nFebruary 15, 1996, Morales filed a precomplaint with the EEOC\n\nalleging that this reclassification was in retaliation for various\n\ncomplaints he had filed, including with the EEOC.3   He alleged that\n\nthe reclassification was intended to dissuade him from bidding for\n\nthe position.\n\n          Second, on March 23, 1996 Morales's supervisor issued him\n\na letter of warning for unsatisfactory performance due to an \"abuse\n\nof coffee breaks,\" which was withdrawn from his personnel file\n\nabout a week later.    On April 25, 1996, Morales filed a second\n\nprecomplaint with the EEOC alleging that a new coffee and lunch\n\nbreak   policy   at   the    Caparra   Heights   station   unlawfully\n\ndiscriminated against male employees.    Specifically, he complained\n\nthat a female employee, Mayra Irene, was allowed to take longer\n\nbreaks than permitted under the policy, while male employees were\n\n\n\n3\n     The EEO complaint process provides an administrative\n     forum for postal employees to resolve discrimination\n     claims against the USPS. Postal workers alleging\n     discrimination are required to file a \"precomplaint\" and\n     consult with an EEO counselor. If the matter raised in\n     the precomplaint is not resolved within the established\n     30-day counseling period, the employee is authorized to\n     file a formal EEO complaint. Once the formal complaint is\n     filed, USPS is compelled to take action within a\n     specified time period. After this period expires, the\n     employee is permitted to file suit in United States\n     District Court.\n\nMorales I, 339 F.3d at 13.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fnot.   He also alleged that on one occasion, his supervisor took\n\nMayra Irene and another female administrative employee out to\n\nlunch, but returned late in violation of the policy.\n\n          Third, on April 9, 19964 Morales's business reply mail,\n\npostage due, and express mail duties were temporarily reassigned to\n\na female employee, again Mayra Irene, while he was given \"window\"\n\nduties to perform.   Morales complained to the EEOC regarding this\n\nrotation of responsibilities, alleging that it was discriminatory\n\nand in retaliation for his previous complaints.\n\n          All three incidents were the subject of formal EEOC\n\ncomplaints which made their way through the administrative process,\n\nand were ultimately dismissed.     See Morales I, 339 F.3d at 18.\n\n          B.   Proceedings Below\n\n          In 1997 Morales brought suit in the district court\n\nalleging that USPS officials had retaliated against him for his\n\nvarious EEOC complaints and had discriminated against him on the\n\nbasis of his gender; that the USPS and Postal Workers Union\n\nofficials breached their obligations under a collective bargaining\n\nagreement (\"CBA\"); and that he suffered an intentional infliction\n\nof emotional distress at defendant's hands.      The district court\n\ngranted summary judgment in Potter's favor on all claims.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  Contrary to his initial allegations, Morales testified that this\nincident may have occurred in May 1996.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f              In Morales I, we affirmed the district court in most\n\nrespects, but disagreed with its conclusion that the acts of\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation Morales had alleged as violations of\n\nthe CBA were not actionable under Title VII.             We determined,\n\nhowever, that many of the allegations of harassment and retaliation\n\nMorales relied on to support his federal claims had never been the\n\nsubject of a formal complaint to the EEOC, and were therefore\n\nbarred   by    Title   VII's   administrative   exhaustion   requirement.\n\nAccordingly, we remanded for the limited purpose of considering\n\nMorales's allegations of discrimination and retaliation arising out\n\nof the three incidents described above, which were addressed in the\n\nEEOC dismissal letters.        Because no court had analyzed Morales's\n\nclaims based on these events under the Title VII rubric, we\n\ndeclined to independently undertake that assessment and instead\n\nleft that task to the district court in the first instance.           We\n\ninstructed as follows:\n\n              Morales is precluded on remand from seeking\n              relief for a plethora of other acts of\n              discrimination and retaliation alleged in his\n              amended complaint, including the discrete acts\n              of bullying, intimidation, and vandalism by\n              his co-workers, his seven-day suspension for\n              violating the USPS uniform policy, his\n              transfer from the Caparra Heights station, his\n              day-long \"expulsions\" from work in February\n              1997, his constructive discharge, and his\n              internal   grievances   against  [the   Postal\n              Workers Union].\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fMorales I, 339 F.3d at 19.5\n\n             Following our remand, the defendants moved for summary\n\njudgment on the theory that Morales's remaining allegations failed\n\nas    a   matter   of   law    to   rise   to    the   level   of   retaliation   or\n\ndiscrimination within the meaning of Title VII, but the district\n\ncourt denied the motion in a margin order, which specified that\n\nthe trial would be \"limited to the three issues which survived\n\nappeal.\"6     Thereafter, the case was referred to a magistrate judge\n\nfor trial, see 28 U.S.C. § 636, who, in a series of pre-trial\n\norders, made it clear that the evidence presented at trial, and the\n\nclaims submitted to the jury, would be limited to the three\n\nspecific incidents identified in our prior opinion.\n\n             Morales testified at the trial, which lasted eight days.\n\nMuch of his testimony and the evidence presented veered well beyond\n\nthe clear lines drawn in our prior opinion and the trial court's\n\nvarious orders. Thus, Morales told the jury about discrete acts of\n\nvandalism by his coworkers, including that they punctured his tires\n\nand poured sugar in his gas tank.\n\n             He described numerous acts of bullying and intimidation\n\nin the workplace.             Among other things, he testified that his\n\n\n5\n     Morales moved for panel reconsideration, which was denied.\n6\n   The district court did not address the merits of Potter's legal\nchallenge, concluding instead that whether Morales suffered\nactionable discrimination or retaliation \"involve[d] factual\nissues, as well as matters of credibility and weight of the\nevidence.\"\n\n                                           -8-\n\fsupervisors engaged in a campaign of harassment and retaliation by\n\n\"put[ting] the employees against\" him; that things became \"really\n\ntense\" in the office when he was investigated \"for some supposed\n\ndeath   threat   [he]     had    given   to    another   employee;\"   that   the\n\n\"environment     became    extremely      violent   against   him;\"   that    he\n\n\"started receiving threats from other employees;\" and that eleven\n\ncoworkers wrote a letter accusing him of \"always playing games\n\nphysically with other employees in events where he kisses them or\n\ntouches them by massaging their backs and necks.\"              The letter was\n\nread into evidence.\n\n           Morales also told the jury that he was suspended for\n\nseven days for violating the USPS uniform policy.                He testified\n\nthat he was transferred from the Caparra Heights station because he\n\n\"was allegedly a safety hazard and/or supposedly a homosexual.\"\n\nMorales's counsel questioned a former supervisor about Morales's\n\nday-long expulsions from work in February 1996, about his seven-day\n\nsuspension for alleged violations of the uniform policy, and about\n\nwhether Morales acted like a \"homosexual man.\"\n\n           Morales spoke at length about the emotional distress he\n\nsuffered as a result of ongoing discrimination and retaliation he\n\nendured at the USPS.        He explained, \"[T]he discrimination became\n\nsomething of everyday.          I lost sleep.     I spent days that I was on\n\nalert without sleeping, thinking about what new thing they're going\n\nto come up with the next day, what new thing.\"                   His treating\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fphysician,   Dr.   Hoyos,    opined    that   Morales   suffered   from   an\n\nadjustment disorder caused by the cumulative effect of multiple\n\nstressors in the workplace.           Of the ten stressors specifically\n\nidentified by Dr. Hoyos, the allegedly discriminatory coffee break\n\npolicy and rotation of window duties incident, combined, were a\n\nsingle stressor.     The altered job posting was not identified as\n\ncontributing to Morales's adjustment disorder.\n\n          In its charge, the trial court instructed the jury that\n\nit could only compensate Morales for the three specific incidents\n\nidentified in our prior opinion.         The verdict form which the jury\n\nreturned indicated generally that it had found Potter liable for\n\nboth discrimination and retaliation, but it did not apportion the\n\ndamages award among the specific claims.             Later, on Morales's\n\nmotion, the court awarded back pay -- offset by the amount of\n\ndisability payments plaintiff had been receiving since 1997, when\n\nMorales began to collect disability payments7 -– and denied his\n\nrequest for front pay.\n\n          Both     parties    filed     post-trial   motions.      Morales\n\nchallenged the court's back pay award as too low, as well as its\n\ndenial of his motion seeking front pay.         Potter filed motions for\n\njudgment as a matter of law on account of Morales's alleged failure\n\nto prove actionable discrimination or retaliation; for remittitur\n\n\n7\n   Since that time, Morales has received approximately 66.33% of\nhis USPS salary through the U.S. Department of Labor's Workers'\nCompensation Program. He technically remains a USPS employee.\n\n                                  -10-\n\for, in the alternative, a new damages trial; and challenging the\n\nback pay award.       See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50, 59(a), (e).         The district\n\ncourt denied Potter's motions, but granted in part Morales's motion\n\nseeking additional back pay due to a computational error in the\n\noriginal judgment.        Both parties filed timely appeals.\n\n                               II.    Discussion\n\n           A.    Standard of Review\n\n           We review de novo the district court's denial of a\n\ndefendant's      motion     for      judgment    as   a     matter     of     law.\n\nRodríguez-Torres v. Caribbean Forms Mfr., Inc., 399 F.3d 52, 57\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).       Potter's primary challenge focuses on the legal\n\nsufficiency      of   Morales's    claims     alleging     discrimination     and\n\nretaliation.      He contends Morales has failed to prove that he\n\nsuffered   any    materially      \"adverse    employment    action.\"        Often,\n\nwhether an employee has suffered a materially adverse employment\n\naction capable of supporting claims under Title VII is a question\n\nof law for the court.        See Bergeron v. Cabral, 560 F.3d 1, 6 n.1\n\n(1st Cir. 2009)(explaining that \"the adversity vel non of that\n\naction is a legal question\"); DeNovellis v. Shalala, 124 F.3d 298,\n\n312 (1st Cir. 1997)(characterizing as a \"legal question\" whether\n\nplaintiff's \"sham assignment constituted an adverse employment\n\naction within the meaning of Title VII\").8               In this analysis, we\n\n\n8\n   With respect to Morales's claims of retaliation, we are mindful\nthat \"the significance of any given act of retaliation will often\ndepend upon the particular circumstances\" of each case. Burlington\n\n                                       -11-\n\fassume    that       the    motivation     for     the       employer's      acts    was\n\ndiscriminatory or retaliatory, and look only to the statutory\n\nsignificance       of    the   harm   these     acts   caused.        Cf.   Burlington\n\nNorthern, 548 U.S. at 70.\n\n              B.   The Scope of the Claims\n\n              As a threshold matter, the parties dispute the scope of\n\nthe claims under review.              Potter maintains that the claims are\n\nlimited to the three incidents described in our prior opinion,\n\nwhile    Morales     asserts      that,   for    various      reasons,      the   claims\n\nsubmitted     to     the   jury   encompassed      all   of     the   \"plethora\"      of\n\nunexhausted allegations which we excluded in the first appeal. One\n\nproblem with Morales's argument is that the trial court's orders in\n\nlimine, instructions to the jury, and discussion of Morales's\n\nclaims   in    its      post-trial    order     were   all    consistent      with   the\n\n\nN. & Santa Fe Ry. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 69 (2006)(\"Context\nmatters.\"); see also Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., 523 U.S.\n81, 82 (1998)(\"The real social impact of workplace behavior often\ndepends   on   a  constellation    of  surrounding   circumstances,\nexpectations, and relationships which are not fully captured by a\nsimple recitation of the words used or the physical acts\nperformed.\"). Thus, we review the factual circumstances bearing on\nthe legal significance of these actions in the light most favorable\nto the verdict. Cf. Bergeron, 560 F.3d at 6 n.1 (noting that \"the\nexistence of an adverse employment action may be a question for the\njury when there is a dispute concerning the manner in which the\naction taken affected the plaintiff-employee\"(citing Rivera-Jiménez\nv. Pierluisi, 362 F.3d 87, 94 (1st Cir. 2004)); see also Granfield\nv. CSX Transp.,Inc., __ F.3d __, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 5299, at *15\n(1st Cir. Mar. 12, 2010)(in considering the denial of a party's\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law, appellate courts \"examine\nthe evidence presented to the jury, and all reasonable inferences\nthat may be drawn from such evidence, in the light most favorable\nto the jury verdict\").\n\n                                          -12-\n\flimitation in our prior opinion.      Though Morales contends that the\n\ndistrict court ultimately agreed with his reading of the scope of\n\nthe claims, he has identified nothing in the record to support that\n\nassertion.\n\n           Another problem with Morales's contention is that our\n\nholding in Morales I limiting his claims to the three incidents we\n\nhave described is \"the law of the case.\"          See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Vigneau, 337 F.3d 62, 67 (1st Cir. 2003)(\"law of the case\"\n\ndoctrine is a \"prudential principle that 'precludes relitigation of\n\nthe legal issues presented in successive stages of a single case\n\nonce those issues have been decided'\"); see also United States v.\n\nRivera-Martínez, 931 F.2d 148, 150 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"When a case is\n\nappealed   and   remanded,   the   decision   of     the   appellate   court\n\nestablishes the law of the case and it must be followed by the\n\ntrial   court    on   remand.\"   (emphasis   in    original)).    We   have\n\nrecognized limited exceptions to the application of this doctrine,\n\nsee Vigneau, 337 F.3d at 68, but Morales never argued to the trial\n\ncourt that any of these limited exceptions should apply, and he\n\ndoes not do so here.     This failure to confront the implications of\n\nour prior holding essentially forecloses Morales's attempt, raised\n\nfor the first time in his opposition to Potter's cross-appeal, to\n\nbroaden the scope of the claims now under review.9\n\n\n9\n   In any event, Morales's various contentions lack merit. Our\nindependent review of Morales's submissions to the EEOC reveal that\nMorales did, in fact, include in a formal complaint the additional\n\n                                   -13-\n\f           Thus, while the trial court may have allowed Morales to\n\nintroduce a broad range of evidence relating to his experience at\n\nthe Caparra Heights station, including evidence relating to his\n\nexcluded allegations, the jury was instructed that it could only\n\ncompensate him for the three specific incidents that we remanded.10\n\n\nallegation that his tires were punctured on two occasions while his\ncar was parked in the Caparra Heights station employee parking lot.\nAt the trial, Morales put into evidence a sworn declaration from a\nco-worker, Samuel Cora-Rivera, which stated that Cora-Rivera had\nheard that Morales's tires were punctured by a Caparra Heights\nsupervisor as an act of retaliation.       On that basis, Morales\nmisleadingly asserts that, because these incidents were included in\na formal EEOC complaint and were proven to be retaliatory, we\nshould consider these acts \"adverse employment actions\" for\npurposes of his retaliation claim. Morales fails to point out,\nhowever, that Cora-Rivera testified at the trial and unambiguosly\nretracted his statements in the declaration, stating that \"[a]ll of\nthe paragraphs [in the sworn statement] are not true.\" We do not\nconsider this incident in our analysis of Morales's Title VII\nclaims.\n10\n     The jury instructions provided, in relevant part:\n\n      Pursuant to the Opinion of the Court of Appeals for the\n      First Circuit . . ., plaintiff Morales's Title VII cause\n      of action is limited to those discrimination and\n      retaliation allegations in his amended complaint that\n      were previously the subject of a formal EEO complaint, to\n      wit;\n      1.

Morales' allegation that the 'coffee and lunch\n           break's policy' was not applied in an equal\n           and nondiscriminatory manner.\n\n                                -14-\n\f\"A basic premise of our jury system is that the jury follows the\n\ncourt's instructions,\" and therefore we assume, as we must, that\n\nthe jury acted according to its charge.

Accordingly, we proceed to assess the legal sufficiency of\n\nonly those claims actually submitted to the jury.11\n\n                    1.

Retaliation\n\n            Unlike its private-sector counterpart, Title VII does not\n\ncontain an express antiretaliation provision applicable to the\n\nfederal government as employer.           See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(a).\n\nNonetheless, we have assumed that the antiretaliation provision\n\napplicable to private employers operates to prohibit retaliation in\n\nthe federal sector.       See DeCaire v. Mukasey, 530 F.3d 1, 19 (1st\n\nCir. 2008); see also Gómez-Perez v.

See, e.g., DeCaire, 530 F.3d at 19; see also Broderick\n\nv. Donaldson, 437 F.3d 1226, 1232 (D.C. Cir. 2006)(\"In the absence\n\nof a finding that the plaintiff has suffered adverse action, a\n\nretaliation claim fails as a matter of law.\").              However, \"the\n\nantiretaliation provision, unlike the substantive provision, is not\n\nlimited   to    discriminatory   actions   that   affect   the   terms   and\n\nconditions of employment.\"       Burlington Northern, 548 U.S. at 64;\n\nsee also Billings v.

Minor\n\n\n12\n   In Gómez-Pérez, the Supreme Court held that the Americans with\nDisabilities Act's (ADA) federal-sector provision, which \"was\npatterned    'directly   after'    Title    VII's   federal-sector\ndiscrimination ban,\" prohibited workplace retaliation through its\nsubstantive antidiscrimination prohibition.     See 128 S. Ct. at\n1940.   Potter thus maintains that Title VII's federal-sector\nprovision bans workplace retaliation, if at all, only if it results\nin an adverse \"personnel action[],\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(a), which\nhe contends means only those actions that affect employment or\nalter the conditions of the workplace.       We do not reach this\nargument because we conclude that even under the Burlington\nNorthern standard Morales has failed to prove he suffered any\nadverse employment action.\n\n                                         -18-\n\fdisruptions in the workplace, including \"petty slights, minor\n\nannoyances, and simple lack of good manners,\" fail to qualify.\n\nBurlington Northern, 548 U.S. at 68.\n\n                 3.    Morales's Claims\n\n                        a.   The Coffee and Lunch Break Policy\n\n          The first set of claims brought by Morales, alleging both\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation, arises from his allegation that the\n\nCaparra Heights coffee and lunch break policy was not enforced in\n\nan equal and nondiscriminatory matter, insofar as certain female\n\nemployees were, at times, permitted to take longer breaks than the\n\npolicy provided for.   Under the policy, employees were allowed to\n\ntake either a half hour or an hour lunch break, plus a ten minute\n\ncoffee break during each half of their shift.                When Morales\n\ncomplained about the discriminatory enforcement of the policy, his\n\nsupervisor began to require all employees to clock in and out each\n\ntime they took a break.\n\n          However, even if two female employees were permitted to\n\ntake longer breaks than Morales on account of their gender, such\n\nselective enforcement of the breaks policy had no material effect\n\non   Morales's   employment    and      therefore   cannot     constitute\n\ndiscrimination within the meaning of the statute.             He was not\n\nformally disciplined for violating the policy,13 or denied the\n\n\n13\n    While Morales received a letter of warning for taking an\nextended coffee break on March 22, 2006, the letter was removed\nfrom plaintiff's file just 5 days later. This preliminary action\n\n                                 -19-\n\fopportunity to take breaks himself.       On these facts, we hold that\n\nthe selective enforcement of the breaks policy fails to sustain a\n\nclaim for gender discrimination.\n\n            Likewise, we conclude that the selective enforcement of\n\nthe breaks policy fails to rise to level of actionable retaliation.\n\nMorales's retaliation claim includes an allegation that, following\n\nthe submission of an EEOC complaint, his supervisor, Enrique López,\n\nclosely monitored the lunch and coffee breaks Morales took.           He\n\nalso testified that, by requiring that all employees clock in and\n\nout each time they went on break, López attempted to stir up other\n\nemployees   against   him.14   Morales,    however,   was   not   treated\n\ndifferently than other employees in the application of the policy\n\nas a result of his complaint; indeed, his complaint rests on the\n\nassertion that all employees were treated equally (though they may\n\n\n\nwas insufficient to support a claim of discrimination.     See 29\nC.F.R. § 1614.107(a)(5) (requiring agency to \"dismiss\" any\nadministrative complaint that \"is moot or alleges that a proposal\nto take a personnel action, or other preliminary step to taking a\npersonnel action, is discriminatory\").\n14\n     Specifically, Morales testified:\n\n      And, in front of everyone, [López] said that, because\n      someone had placed an EEO[C complaint], now everybody had\n      to punch in their timecards for every time they would go\n      out on a break, when they left on break, and when they\n      came back.     Obviously, this was a policy that the\n      employees did not like. And so, all of them . . . well,\n      maybe not all of them, but most of them started to look\n      at me bad.\n           It was a very smart way of putting the employees\n      against me.\n\n                                -20-\n\fnot have liked it).       Thus, the adverse action anchoring Morales's\n\ncomplaint of retaliation is essentially the relief he requested in\n\nhis discrimination complaint, and therefore would not dissuade a\n\nreasonable    employee     from    filing    or     supporting   a    charge   of\n\ndiscrimination.      Cf. Burlington Northern, 548 U.S. at 68 (\"An\n\nemployee's    decision    to    report    discriminatory     behavior     cannot\n\nimmunize that employee from those petty slights or minor annoyances\n\nthat often take place at work and that all employees experience.\").\n\n            Accordingly, Morales's claims arising from the selective\n\nenforcement of the breaks policy fail as a matter of law because\n\nMorales suffered no material adverse employment action within the\n\nmeaning of Title VII's discrimination or retaliation provisions.\n\n                           b.     Rotation of Responsibilities\n\n            Next, Morales asserts claims for both discrimination and\n\nretaliation arising from the \"incident in which plaintiff's duties\n\nand responsibilities were awarded to a female employee and he was\n\ngiven window clerk duties to perform.\"            Morales I, 339 F.3d at 18.\n\nWe   hold   that   this   temporary      rotation    of   Morales's    preferred\n\ndistribution duties to a female clerk fails to qualify as an\n\nadverse employment action for purposes of either claim.\n\n            Morales was required to perform \"window\" duties rather\n\nthan \"distribution\" duties for only a limited period of time, those\n\nduties fell within his job description (indeed, which he bid for),\n\nand there was evidence that on other, albeit rare, occasions he had\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fperformed \"window\" duties in the normal course of his employment.\n\nCf. Butler v. Ala. Dep't of Transp., 536 F.3d 1209, 1215 (11th Cir.\n\n2008) (\"Requiring an employee to perform her job is not a change in\n\nthe terms, conditions, or privileges of her employment.\"). Morales\n\nhimself testified that, \"I was trained for [window duties].                 I\n\ncould do [them].     I was prepared to do [them].\"           Such a minor\n\ndisruption in the tasks Morales preferred to perform cannot, as a\n\nmatter of law, sustain his claim for damages under Title VII's\n\nantidiscrimination   provision.       See   Marrero,   304    F.3d    at    23\n\n(secretary's   permanent,   lateral   reassignment     to    work    in   same\n\ncapacity for different boss did not rise to level of an adverse\n\nemployment action where \"her general job description and salary\n\nremained the same,\" notwithstanding the fact that she \"was required\n\nto do more work, subjected to 'extreme supervision,' and forced to\n\nundergo a period of probation\"); see also Washington v. Ill. Dep't\n\nof Revenue, 420 F.3d 658, 661 (7th Cir. 2005) (explaining that \"a\n\nlateral transfer that does not affect pay (or significantly affect\n\nworking conditions) cannot be called discriminatory\").15\n\n\n15\n   We emphasize that there was no evidence presented at trial that\nthe rotation was permanent, or that he was divested of meaningful\njob responsibilities as a consequence. Cf. DeNovellis, 124 F.3d at\n306 (explaining that \"five-month assignment [of plaintiff] to a\nfinancial position for which he had no background and the\nconcomitant deprivation of meaningful duties constituted an adverse\nemployment action within the meaning of Title VII\"). Rather, his\ntestimony demonstrates that he experienced the sort of temporary\n\"reassignment that involves only minor changes in working\nconditions [which] normally does not constitute an adverse\nemployment action.\" Marrero, 304 F.3d at 23.\n\n                                  -22-\n\f            Nor      can   this      temporary    rotation    of    responsibilities\n\nqualify    as   an    adverse        employment    action    for    purposes     of    his\n\nretaliation claim.         In appropriate circumstances, disadvantageous\n\nwork assignments may qualify as materially adverse, but Morales's\n\ntemporary reassignment is a far cry from those situations where we\n\nhave found actionable retaliation.                See generally Valentín-Almeyda\n\nv. Municipality of Aguadilla, 447 F.3d 85, 95 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(finding    a   totality        of    assignments,    which    included      a   police\n\nofficer's transfer for an \"unusually long\" duration to a \"remote\n\nand solitary\" duty site that was \"regarded as punishment\" by\n\nofficers, to constitute adverse employment action).\n\n            While Morales testified that the window duties presented\n\ncertain \"physical difficulties\" in light of his arm condition, he\n\nmade it crystal clear that he was able to perform those duties \"as\n\nlong as it was not for a long time\" and he did not state that he\n\nexperienced any unique hardship as a result of performing \"window\"\n\ntasks.     There      is   no     evidence    that    window       duties   were      more\n\ndifficult, less prestigious, or objectively inferior to Morales's\n\ndistribution duties; rather, the gravamen of Morales's complaint is\n\nthat he preferred his regular assignment.                      Compare Burlington\n\nNorthern, 548 U.S. at 71 (holding that permanent reassignment of a\n\nfemale forklift operator to track laborer was a materially adverse\n\naction where there was \"considerable evidence that the track\n\nlaborer duties were 'by all accounts more arduous and dirtier';\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\fthat the 'forklift operator position required more qualifications,\n\nwhich   is   an    indication    of   prestige';   and   that   'the   forklift\n\noperator position was objectively considered a better job and the\n\nmale employees resented [the plaintiff] for occupying it'\").\n\n             Under the circumstances, we hold that the temporary\n\nrotation of Morales preferred window duties does not qualify as\n\nmaterially adverse and cannot support his claims under Title VII.\n\n                           c.    The Altered Job Posting\n\n             Morales's final claim, alleging retaliation only, focuses\n\non the altered job posting.           He maintains that, because he filed a\n\ncomplaint with the EEOC, the USPS changed the days off that were\n\nexpected to come with a certain Distribution and Window Clerk\n\nposition when it was posted for bidding.           There is no dispute that\n\nthe only difference between Morales's position at the time of this\n\nincident and the position in which he expressed an interest was\n\nthat the new posting was expected to come with Saturdays and\n\nSundays off, but was ultimately posted with Thursdays and Sundays\n\noff instead.       We conclude that this alteration of rest days was\n\ninsufficient to dissuade a reasonable employee from filing or\n\nsupporting a charge of discrimination.\n\n             In    appropriate    circumstances,     not   present     here,   a\n\nschedule change may operate to dissuade a reasonable employee from\n\nreporting workplace discrimination.            See Burlington Northern, 548\n\nU.S. at 69.       In this case, however, there is no indication in the\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\frecord that changing the days off associated with the new posting\n\naffected Morales any more than it did other eligible bidders.                    See\n\nLockridge, 597 F.3d at 473 (no adverse employment action where\n\ndenial of office space \"left [the employee] in no worse a position\n\nthan that held by similarly situated faculty members\").                 Moreover,\n\nthere is no evidence that Morales suffered any undue hardship as a\n\nresult of continuing to have Sundays and Mondays, rather than\n\nSundays and Saturdays, off.          See Burlington Northern, 548 U.S. at\n\n69 (explaining that \"[a] schedule change in an employee's work\n\nschedule may make little difference to many workers, [but] may\n\nmatter enormously to a young mother with school-age children\"); see\n\nalso Washington, 420 F.3d at 662 (finding flex-time schedule\n\ncritical to employee with disabled child, and recognizing that\n\nactions \"that would be harmless to most people [may] do real damage\n\nto select targets\").        Rather, Morales testified that, as a result\n\nof the rotation, he continued to have Sundays and Mondays off\n\nrather   than    a   normal   weekend   schedule,     which    he     would     have\n\npreferred.      This is plainly insufficient to support a claim for\n\nretaliation under the statute. Cf. Hughes v. Stottlemyre, 454 F.3d\n\n791, 797 (8th Cir. 2006) (no actionable retaliation where there was\n\n\"no   evidence       to   suggest    [employee]     suffered      a    materially\n\nsignificant     disadvantage    by    having   to   work   more       Sundays    and\n\n\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fWednesdays,\" rather than his preferred schedule).16         We note that\n\nMorales's own medical expert failed to identify the altered job\n\nposting as a stressor contributing to his adjustment disorder.\n\n          Thus,   after   careful    consideration,   we   conclude   that\n\nMorales has failed to prove that he suffered any adverse employment\n\naction capable of supporting his claims for discrimination or\n\nretaliation.17 Accordingly, we vacate the verdict and remand to the\n\ndistrict court with instructions to enter judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw in Potter's favor.    No costs are awarded.\n\n\n\n16\n   Other courts confronting roughly similar circumstances have come\nto the same conclusion. Thomas v. Potter, 202 Fed. Appx. 118, 119\n(7th Cir. 2006) (unpublished decision)(plaintiff's assertion that\nshift change was undesirable or inconvenient did not rise to the\nlevel of a materially adverse employment action under Burlington\nwhere the plaintiff did not assert and record did not contain\nevidence that the plaintiff had \"a unique vulnerability that the\nPostal Service knew about and sought to exploit by changing his\nshift schedule\"); Smith v. Potter, 629 F.

Hertz, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Rosa E. Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, District of Puerto Rico, were on brief for appellee/cross-appellant.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, BALDOCK,<sup>[*]</sup> Senior Circuit Judge, and HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff-appellant/cross-appellee Angel David Morales-Vallellanes (\"Morales\") obtained a jury verdict in his favor on claims under Title VII alleging discrimination and retaliation by his former employer, John E. Potter, the United States Postmaster General (\"Potter\"). In a prior appeal, we limited Morales to pursuing claims based on three discrete incidents that were previously the subject of formal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaints, and expressly precluded him from seeking relief for a \"plethora\" of other allegations raised for the first time in the district court. <i>See </i><i>Morales-Vallellanes v. Potter,</i> 339 F.3d 9, 19 (1st Cir.2003) [hereinafter <i>\"Morales I\"</i>]. Despite this limitation, the evidence presented at trial included numerous allegations of discrimination and retaliation that were well beyond the scope of our limited remand. Nonetheless, the jury was instructed that Morales could only recover for his claims based on the three specific allegations addressed in the prior appeal. On December 21, 2007, the jury returned a $500,000 lump-sum verdict in his favor, which was later reduced by way of statutory cap to $300,000. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1981a (b)(3)(D). The trial court awarded an additional $64,504 in back pay.</p>\n<p>Morales brought this appeal to challenge the sufficiency of the trial court's back pay award, as well as its decision denying him front pay. On cross appeal, Potter contends that the jury verdict cannot stand because Morales failed to prove that he suffered any materially adverse employment action capable of supporting his claims under Title VII. Potter also challenges the jury's damages award as grossly excessive and based on evidence that we previously excluded; contends that Morales was not entitled to back pay; and in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> various ways opposes Morales's contentions that his damages award was inadequate.</p>\n<p>After careful consideration, we conclude as a matter of law that Morales has failed to prove that he suffered any material adverse employment action within the meaning of Title VII's discrimination or retaliation provisions. We therefore vacate the jury verdict and remand with instructions to enter judgment in Potter's favor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Facts<sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p>We sketch only the basic facts essential to this appeal. Morales began his employment with the United States Postal Service (\"USPS\") in 1988 as a Distribution Clerk. In 1990, he was transferred to the USPS station in Caparra Heights, Puerto Rico. In 1995, Morales bid for and obtained the position of Distribution and Window Clerk. In this capacity, Morales typically performed back-office \"distribution\" duties, which included \"business reply,\" \"express mail,\" and \"postage due\" functions. Because Morales worked the early shift and had an arm injury that limited the tasks he could perform without pain, Morales rarely performed \"window\" duties, which included customer interactions; nonetheless, he was trained to do so, did so on occasion, and those tasks were part of the job description he had bid for.</p>\n<p>Beginning in approximately early 1996, Morales lodged several complaints with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regarding dust accumulation, rodent infestation, and general unsanitary conditions at the Caparra Heights station. Eventually, OSHA conducted a formal inspection and issued the USPS citations for various safety and health violations. Around the same time, Morales also filed unrelated, employment-based complaints with the EEOC. Morales alleged that his supervisors and coworkers began to take various retaliatory actions against him for filing these complaints, and to discriminate against him on account of his gender. Only three such actions are relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p>First, in January 1996 Morales expressed interest in bidding for a Distribution and Window Clerk position that was expected to come with Saturdays and Sundays off, a coveted position given that many USPS employees had an irregular weekend schedule.<sup>[2]</sup> Thereafter, the USPS reclassified the position so that, when it was posted, it came with Thursdays and Sundays off instead. On February 15, 1996, Morales filed a precomplaint with the EEOC alleging that this reclassification was in retaliation for various complaints he had filed, including with the EEOC.<sup>[3]</sup> He alleged that the reclassification was intended <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> to dissuade him from bidding for the position.</p>\n<p>Second, on March 23, 1996 Morales's supervisor issued him a letter of warning for unsatisfactory performance due to an \"abuse of coffee breaks,\" which was withdrawn from his personnel file about a week later. On April 25, 1996, Morales filed a second precomplaint with the EEOC alleging that a new coffee and lunch break policy at the Caparra Heights station unlawfully discriminated against male employees. Specifically, he complained that a female employee, Mayra Irene, was allowed to take longer breaks than permitted under the policy, while male employees were not. He also alleged that on one occasion, his supervisor took Mayra Irene and another female administrative employee out to lunch, but returned late in violation of the policy.</p>\n<p>Third, on April 9, 1996<sup>[4]</sup> Morales's business reply mail, postage due, and express mail duties were temporarily reassigned to a female employee, again Mayra Irene, while he was given \"window\" duties to perform. Morales complained to the EEOC regarding this rotation of responsibilities, alleging that it was discriminatory and in retaliation for his previous complaints.</p>\n<p>All three incidents were the subject of formal EEOC complaints which made their way through the administrative process, and were ultimately dismissed. <i>See </i><i>Morales I,</i> 339 F.3d at 18.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Proceedings Below</h2>\n<p>In 1997 Morales brought suit in the district court alleging that USPS officials had retaliated against him for his various EEOC complaints and had discriminated against him on the basis of his gender; that the USPS and Postal Workers Union officials breached their obligations under a collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\"); and that he suffered an intentional infliction of emotional distress at defendant's hands. The district court granted summary judgment in Potter's favor on all claims.</p>\n<p>In <i>Morales I,</i> we affirmed the district court in most respects, but disagreed with its conclusion that the acts of discrimination and retaliation Morales had alleged as violations of the CBA were not actionable under Title VII. We determined, however, that many of the allegations of harassment and retaliation Morales relied on to support his federal claims had never been the subject of a formal complaint to the EEOC, and were therefore barred by Title VII's administrative exhaustion requirement. Accordingly, we remanded for the limited purpose of considering Morales's allegations of discrimination and retaliation arising out of the three incidents described above, which were addressed in the EEOC dismissal letters. Because no court had analyzed Morales's claims based on these events under the Title VII rubric, we declined to independently undertake that assessment and instead left that task to the district court in the first instance. We instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Morales is precluded on remand from seeking relief for a plethora of other acts of discrimination and retaliation alleged in his amended complaint, including the discrete acts of bullying, intimidation, and vandalism by his co-workers, his seven-day suspension for violating the USPS uniform policy, his transfer from the Caparra Heights station, his day-long \"expulsions\" from work in February <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> 1997, his constructive discharge, and his internal grievances against [the Postal Workers Union].</blockquote>\n<p><i>Morales I,</i> 339 F.3d at 19.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Following our remand, the defendants moved for summary judgment on the theory that Morales's remaining allegations failed as a matter of law to rise to the level of retaliation or discrimination within the meaning of Title VII, but the district court denied the motion in a margin order, which specified that the trial would be \"limited to the three issues which survived appeal.\"<sup>[6]</sup> Thereafter, the case was referred to a magistrate judge for trial, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. § 636, who, in a series of pre-trial orders, made it clear that the evidence presented at trial, and the claims submitted to the jury, would be limited to the three specific incidents identified in our prior opinion.</p>\n<p>Morales testified at the trial, which lasted eight days. Much of his testimony and the evidence presented veered well beyond the clear lines drawn in our prior opinion and the trial court's various orders. Thus, Morales told the jury about discrete acts of vandalism by his coworkers, including that they punctured his tires and poured sugar in his gas tank.</p>\n<p>He described numerous acts of bullying and intimidation in the workplace. Among other things, he testified that his supervisors engaged in a campaign of harassment and retaliation by \"put[ting] the employees against\" him; that things became \"really tense\" in the office when he was investigated \"for some supposed death threat [he] had given to another employee;\" that the \"environment became extremely violent against him;\" that he \"started receiving threats from other employees;\" and that eleven coworkers wrote a letter accusing him of \"always playing games physically with other employees in events where he kisses them or touches them by massaging their backs and necks.\" The letter was read into evidence.</p>\n<p>Morales also told the jury that he was suspended for seven days for violating the USPS uniform policy. He testified that he was transferred from the Caparra Heights station because he \"was allegedly a safety hazard and/or supposedly a homosexual.\" Morales's counsel questioned a former supervisor about Morales's day-long expulsions from work in February 1996, about his seven-day suspension for alleged violations of the uniform policy, and about whether Morales acted like a \"homosexual man.\"</p>\n<p>Morales spoke at length about the emotional distress he suffered as a result of ongoing discrimination and retaliation he endured at the USPS. He explained, \"[T]he discrimination became something of everyday. I lost sleep. I spent days that I was on alert without sleeping, thinking about what new thing they're going to come up with the next day, what new thing.\" His treating physician, Dr. Hoyos, opined that Morales suffered from an adjustment disorder caused by the cumulative effect of multiple stressors in the workplace. Of the ten stressors specifically identified by Dr. Hoyos, the allegedly discriminatory coffee break policy and rotation of window duties incident, combined, were a single stressor. The altered job posting was not identified as contributing to Morales's adjustment disorder.</p>\n<p>In its charge, the trial court instructed the jury that it could only compensate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> Morales for the three specific incidents identified in our prior opinion. The verdict form which the jury returned indicated generally that it had found Potter liable for both discrimination and retaliation, but it did not apportion the damages award among the specific claims. Later, on Morales's motion, the court awarded back payoffset by the amount of disability payments plaintiff had been receiving since 1997, when Morales began to collect disability payments<sup>[7]</sup>and denied his request for front pay.</p>\n<p>Both parties filed post-trial motions. Morales challenged the court's back pay award as too low, as well as its denial of his motion seeking front pay. Potter filed motions for judgment as a matter of law on account of Morales's alleged failure to prove actionable discrimination or retaliation; for remittitur or, in the alternative, a new damages trial; and challenging the back pay award. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 50, 59(a), (e). The district court denied Potter's motions, but granted in part Morales's motion seeking additional back pay due to a computational error in the original judgment. Both parties filed timely appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review <i>de novo</i> the district court's denial of a defendant's motion for judgment as a matter of law. <i>Rodríguez-Torres v. Caribbean Forms Mfr., Inc.,</i> 399 F.3d 52, 57 (1st Cir.2005). Potter's primary challenge focuses on the legal sufficiency of Morales's claims alleging discrimination and retaliation. He contends Morales has failed to prove that he suffered any materially \"adverse employment action.\" Often, whether an employee has suffered a materially adverse employment action capable of supporting claims under Title VII is a question of law for the court. <i>See </i><i>Bergeron v. Cabral,</i> 560 F.3d 1, 6 n. 1 (1st Cir.2009)(explaining that \"the adversity vel non of that action is a legal question\"); <i>DeNovellis v. Shalala,</i> 124 F.3d 298, 312 (1st Cir.1997)(characterizing as a \"legal question\" whether plaintiff's \"sham assignment constituted an adverse employment action within the meaning of Title VII\").<sup>[8]</sup> In this analysis, we assume that the motivation for the employer's acts was discriminatory or retaliatory, and look only to the statutory significance of the harm these acts caused. <i>Cf. Burlington Northern,</i> 548 U.S. at 70, 126 S.Ct. 2405.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> B. The Scope of the Claims</h2>\n<p>As a threshold matter, the parties dispute the scope of the claims under review. Potter maintains that the claims are limited to the three incidents described in our prior opinion, while Morales asserts that, for various reasons, the claims submitted to the jury encompassed all of the \"plethora\" of unexhausted allegations which we excluded in the first appeal. One problem with Morales's argument is that the trial court's orders in limine, instructions to the jury, and discussion of Morales's claims in its post-trial order were all consistent with the limitation in our prior opinion. Though Morales contends that the district court ultimately agreed with his reading of the scope of the claims, he has identified nothing in the record to support that assertion.</p>\n<p>Another problem with Morales's contention is that our holding in <i>Morales I</i> limiting his claims to the three incidents we have described is \"the law of the case.\" <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Vigneau,</i> 337 F.3d 62, 67 (1st Cir.2003)(\"law of the case\" doctrine is a \"prudential principle that `precludes relitigation of the legal issues presented in successive stages of a single case once those issues have been decided'\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Rivera-Martínez,</i> 931 F.2d 148, 150 (1st Cir.1991) (\"When a case is appealed and remanded, the decision of the appellate court establishes the law of the case and it <i>must</i> be followed by the trial court on remand.\" (emphasis in original)). We have recognized limited exceptions to the application of this doctrine, <i>see </i><i>Vigneau,</i> 337 F.3d at 68, but Morales never argued to the trial court that any of these limited exceptions should apply, and he does not do so here. This failure to confront the implications of our prior holding essentially forecloses Morales's attempt, raised for the first time in his opposition to Potter's cross-appeal, to broaden the scope of the claims now under review.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, while the trial court may have allowed Morales to introduce a broad range of evidence relating to his experience at the Caparra Heights station, including evidence relating to his excluded allegations, the jury was instructed that it could only compensate him for the three specific incidents that we remanded.<sup>[10]</sup> \"A <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> basic premise of our jury system is that the jury follows the court's instructions,\" and therefore we assume, as we must, that the jury acted according to its charge. <i>Refuse &amp; Envtl. Sys., Inc. v. Indus. Servs. of Am., Inc.,</i> 932 F.2d 37, 40 (1st Cir.1991). Accordingly, we proceed to assess the legal sufficiency of only those claims actually submitted to the jury.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Discrimination</h2>\n<p>Title VII provides that \"[a]ll personnel actions\" affecting federal employees \"shall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(a). In order to present a legally viable claim of employment discrimination under the statute, a plaintiff must show, among other things, that he suffered an \"adverse employment action\" on account of a protected ground. <i>García v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,</i> 535 F.3d 23, 31 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see also </i><i>George v. Leavitt,</i> 407 F.3d 405, 411 (D.C.Cir.2005) (explaining that \"Title VII places the same restrictions on federal [employers] as it does on private employers, and so we may construe the latter provision in terms of the former\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). An \"adverse employment action\" is one that \"affect[s] employment or alter[s] the conditions of the workplace,\" <i>Burlington Northern,</i> 548 U.S. at 61-62, 126 S.Ct. 2405, and typically involves discrete changes in the terms of employment, such as \"hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing significant change in benefits.\" <i>Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. 742, 761, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998); <i>accord </i><i>Gu v. Boston Police Dep't,</i> 312 F.3d 6, 14 (1st Cir.2002) (\"To be adverse, an action must <i>materially</i> change the conditions of plaintiffs' employ.\" (emphasis added)). A materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment \"must be more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities.\" <i>Marrero v. Goya of P.R., Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 7, 23 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Whether an employment action is materially \"adverse\"and therefore actionable under Title VIIis gauged by an objective standard. <i>Blackie v. Maine,</i> 75 F.3d 716, 725 (1st Cir.1996). \"Work places are rarely idyllic retreats, and the mere fact that an employee is displeased by an employer's act or omission does not elevate that act or omission to the level of a materially adverse employment action.\" <i>Marrero,</i> 304 F.3d at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Retaliation</h2>\n<p>Unlike its private-sector counterpart, Title VII does not contain an express antiretaliation provision applicable to the federal government as employer. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(a). Nonetheless, we have assumed that the antiretaliation provision <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> applicable to private employers operates to prohibit retaliation in the federal sector. <i>See </i><i>DeCaire v. Mukasey,</i> 530 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see also </i><i>Gómez-Perez v. Potter,</i> 553 U.S. 474, 128 S.Ct. 1931, 1941 n. 4, 170 L.Ed.2d 887 (2008) (acknowledging, but declining to decide, the open question of \"whether Title VII bans retaliation in federal employment\").</p>\n<p>As with a claim for discrimination, a plaintiff alleging workplace retaliation must prove, among other things, that he suffered an \"adverse employment action\" on account of a protected activity. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>DeCaire,</i> 530 F.3d at 19; <i>see also </i><i>Broderick v. Donaldson,</i> 437 F.3d 1226, 1232 (D.C.Cir.2006)(\"In the absence of a finding that the plaintiff has suffered adverse action, a retaliation claim fails as a matter of law.\"). However, \"the antiretaliation provision, unlike the substantive provision, is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment.\" <i>Burlington Northern,</i> 548 U.S. at 64, 126 S.Ct. 2405; <i>see also </i><i>Billings v. Town of Grafton,</i> 515 F.3d 39, 54 (1st Cir.2008)(\"[C]onduct need not relate to the terms or conditions of employment to give rise to a retaliation claim.\"). Rather, a plaintiff may satisfy this requirement by showing that \"a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, `which in this context means it well might have `dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.'\" <i>Burlington Northern,</i> 548 U.S. at 64, 126 S.Ct. 2405.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>\"This is an objective test and `should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position, considering all the circumstances.'\" <i>Lockridge v. Univ. of Me. Sys.,</i> 597 F.3d 464, 472 (1st Cir.2010) (quoting <i>Burlington Northern,</i> 548 U.S. at 71, 126 S.Ct. 2405). Examples of adverse employment actions in the retaliation context \"include `termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, significantly diminished material responsibilities, or other indices that might be unique to a particular situation.'\" <i>Lapka v. Chertoff,</i> 517 F.3d 974, 986 (7th Cir.2008)(quoting <i>Crady v. Liberty Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Indiana,</i> 993 F.2d 132, 136 (7th Cir.1993)). Minor disruptions in the workplace, including \"petty slights, minor annoyances, and simple lack of good manners,\" fail to qualify. <i>Burlington Northern,</i> 548 U.S. at 68, 126 S.Ct. 2405.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Morales's Claims</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. The Coffee and Lunch Break Policy</h2>\n<p>The first set of claims brought by Morales, alleging both discrimination and retaliation, arises from his allegation that the Caparra Heights coffee and lunch break policy was not enforced in an equal and nondiscriminatory matter, insofar as certain female employees were, at times, permitted to take longer breaks than the policy provided for. Under the policy, employees were allowed to take either a half <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> hour or an hour lunch break, plus a ten minute coffee break during each half of their shift. When Morales complained about the discriminatory enforcement of the policy, his supervisor began to require all employees to clock in and out each time they took a break.</p>\n<p>However, even if two female employees were permitted to take longer breaks than Morales on account of their gender, such selective enforcement of the breaks policy had no material effect on Morales's employment and therefore cannot constitute discrimination within the meaning of the statute. He was not formally disciplined for violating the policy,<sup>[13]</sup> or denied the opportunity to take breaks himself. On these facts, we hold that the selective enforcement of the breaks policy fails to sustain a claim for gender discrimination.</p>\n<p>Likewise, we conclude that the selective enforcement of the breaks policy fails to rise to level of actionable retaliation. Morales's retaliation claim includes an allegation that, following the submission of an EEOC complaint, his supervisor, Enrique López, closely monitored the lunch and coffee breaks Morales took. He also testified that, by requiring that all employees clock in and out each time they went on break, López attempted to stir up other employees against him.<sup>[14]</sup> Morales, however, was not treated differently than other employees in the application of the policy as a result of his complaint; indeed, his complaint rests on the assertion that all employees were treated equally (though they may not have liked it). Thus, the adverse action anchoring Morales's complaint of retaliation is essentially the relief he requested in his discrimination complaint, and therefore would not dissuade a reasonable employee from filing or supporting a charge of discrimination. <i>Cf. Burlington Northern,</i> 548 U.S. at 68, 126 S.Ct. 2405 (\"An employee's decision to report discriminatory behavior cannot immunize that employee from those petty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience.\").</p>\n<p>Accordingly, Morales's claims arising from the selective enforcement of the breaks policy fail as a matter of law because Morales suffered no material adverse employment action within the meaning of Title VII's discrimination or retaliation provisions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Rotation of Responsibilities</h2>\n<p>Next, Morales asserts claims for both discrimination and retaliation arising from the \"incident in which plaintiff's duties and responsibilities were awarded to a female employee and he was given window clerk duties to perform.\" <i>Morales I,</i> 339 F.3d at 18. We hold that this temporary rotation of Morales's preferred distribution duties to a female clerk fails to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> qualify as an adverse employment action for purposes of either claim.</p>\n<p>Morales was required to perform \"window\" duties rather than \"distribution\" duties for only a limited period of time, those duties fell within his job description (indeed, which he bid for), and there was evidence that on other, albeit rare, occasions he had performed \"window\" duties in the normal course of his employment. <i>Cf. </i><i>Butler v. Ala. Dep't of Transp.,</i> 536 F.3d 1209, 1215 (11th Cir.2008) (\"Requiring an employee to perform her job is not a change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of her employment.\"). Morales himself testified that, \"I was trained for [window duties]. I could do [them]. I was prepared to do [them].\" Such a minor disruption in the tasks Morales preferred to perform cannot, as a matter of law, sustain his claim for damages under Title VII's antidiscrimination provision. <i>See </i><i>Marrero,</i> 304 F.3d at 23 (secretary's permanent, lateral reassignment to work in same capacity for different boss did not rise to level of an adverse employment action where \"her general job description and salary remained the same,\" notwithstanding the fact that she \"was required to do more work, subjected to `extreme supervision,' and forced to undergo a period of probation\"); <i>see also </i><i>Washington v. Ill. Dep't of Revenue,</i> 420 F.3d 658, 661 (7th Cir.2005) (explaining that \"a lateral transfer that does not affect pay (or significantly affect working conditions) cannot be called discriminatory\").<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>Nor can this temporary rotation of responsibilities qualify as an adverse employment action for purposes of his retaliation claim. In appropriate circumstances, disadvantageous work assignments may qualify as materially adverse, but Morales's temporary reassignment is a far cry from those situations where we have found actionable retaliation. <i>See generally </i><i>Valentín-Almeyda v. Municipality of Aguadilla,</i> 447 F.3d 85, 95 (1st Cir.2006) (finding a totality of assignments, which included a police officer's transfer for an \"unusually long\" duration to a \"remote and solitary\" duty site that was \"regarded as punishment\" by officers, to constitute adverse employment action).</p>\n<p>While Morales testified that the window duties presented certain \"physical difficulties\" in light of his arm condition, he made it crystal clear that he was able to perform those duties \"as long as it was not for a long time\" and he did not state that he experienced any unique hardship as a result of performing \"window\" tasks. There is no evidence that window duties were more difficult, less prestigious, or objectively inferior to Morales's distribution duties; rather, the gravamen of Morales's complaint is that he preferred his regular assignment. <i>Compare Burlington Northern,</i> 548 U.S. at 71, 126 S.Ct. 2405 (holding that permanent reassignment of a female forklift operator to track laborer was a materially adverse action where there was \"considerable evidence that the track laborer duties were `by all accounts more arduous and dirtier'; that the `forklift operator position required more qualifications, which is an indication of prestige'; and that `the forklift operator position was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> objectively considered a better job and the male employees resented [the plaintiff] for occupying it'\").</p>\n<p>Under the circumstances, we hold that the temporary rotation of Morales preferred window duties does not qualify as materially adverse and cannot support his claims under Title VII.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. The Altered Job Posting</h2>\n<p>Morales's final claim, alleging retaliation only, focuses on the altered job posting. He maintains that, because he filed a complaint with the EEOC, the USPS changed the days off that were expected to come with a certain Distribution and Window Clerk position when it was posted for bidding. There is no dispute that the only difference between Morales's position at the time of this incident and the position in which he expressed an interest was that the new posting was expected to come with Saturdays and Sundays off, but was ultimately posted with Thursdays and Sundays off instead. We conclude that this alteration of rest days was insufficient to dissuade a reasonable employee from filing or supporting a charge of discrimination.</p>\n<p>In appropriate circumstances, not present here, a schedule change may operate to dissuade a reasonable employee from reporting workplace discrimination. <i>See Burlington Northern,</i> 548 U.S. at 69, 126 S.Ct. 2405. In this case, however, there is no indication in the record that changing the days off associated with the new posting affected Morales any more than it did other eligible bidders. <i>See </i><i>Lockridge,</i> 597 F.3d at 473 (no adverse employment action where denial of office space \"left [the employee] in no worse a position than that held by similarly situated faculty members\"). Moreover, there is no evidence that Morales suffered any undue hardship as a result of continuing to have Sundays and Mondays, rather than Sundays and Saturdays, off. <i>See Burlington Northern,</i> 548 U.S. at 69, 126 S.Ct. 2405 (explaining that \"[a] schedule change in an employee's work schedule may make little difference to many workers, [but] may matter enormously to a young mother with school-age children\"); <i>see also </i><i>Washington,</i> 420 F.3d at 662 (finding flex-time schedule critical to employee with disabled child, and recognizing that actions \"that would be harmless to most people [may] do real damage to select targets\"). Rather, Morales testified that, as a result of the rotation, he continued to have Sundays and Mondays off rather than a normal weekend schedule, which he would have preferred. This is plainly insufficient to support a claim for retaliation under the statute. <i>Cf. </i><i>Hughes v. Stottlemyre,</i> 454 F.3d 791, 797 (8th Cir. 2006) (no actionable retaliation where there was \"no evidence to suggest [employee] suffered a materially significant disadvantage by having to work more Sundays and Wednesdays,\" rather than his preferred schedule).<sup>[16]</sup> We note that Morales's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> own medical expert failed to identify the altered job posting as a stressor contributing to his adjustment disorder.</p>\n<p>Thus, after careful consideration, we conclude that Morales has failed to prove that he suffered any adverse employment action capable of supporting his claims for discrimination or retaliation.<sup>[17]</sup> Accordingly, we vacate the verdict and remand to the district court with instructions to enter judgment as a matter of law in Potter's favor. No costs are awarded.</p>\n<p><i>Vacated and Remanded.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Additional detail regarding Morales's allegations can be found in our prior opinion. <i>See </i><i>Morales I,</i> 339 F.3d at 12-14.</p>\n<p>[2]  At the time, Morales had Sundays and Mondays off. Morales testified that at some point in 1996, he was given Saturday and Sundays off instead.</p>\n<p>[3]  The EEO complaint process provides an administrative forum for postal employees to resolve discrimination claims against the USPS. Postal workers alleging discrimination are required to file a \"precomplaint\" and consult with an EEO counselor. If the matter raised in the precomplaint is not resolved within the established 30-day counseling period, the employee is authorized to file a formal EEO complaint. Once the formal complaint is filed, USPS is compelled to take action within a specified time period. After this period expires, the employee is permitted to file suit in United States District Court.\n</p>\n<p><i>Morales I,</i> 339 F.3d at 13.</p>\n<p>[4]  Contrary to his initial allegations, Morales testified that this incident may have occurred in May 1996.</p>\n<p>[5]  Morales moved for panel reconsideration, which was denied.</p>\n<p>[6]  The district court did not address the merits of Potter's legal challenge, concluding instead that whether Morales suffered actionable discrimination or retaliation \"involve[d] factual issues, as well as matters of credibility and weight of the evidence.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  Since that time, Morales has received approximately 66.33% of his USPS salary through the U.S. Department of Labor's Workers' Compensation Program. He technically remains a USPS employee.</p>\n<p>[8]  With respect to Morales's claims of retaliation, we are mindful that \"the significance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon the particular circumstances\" of each case. <i>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. v. White,</i> 548 U.S. 53, 69, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006)(\"Context matters.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs.,</i> 523 U.S. 75, 82, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998)(\"The real social impact of workplace behavior often depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships which are not fully captured by a simple recitation of the words used or the physical acts performed.\"). Thus, we review the factual circumstances bearing on the legal significance of these actions in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>Cf. </i><i>Bergeron,</i> 560 F.3d at 6 n. 1 (noting that \"the existence of an adverse employment action may be a question for the jury when there is a dispute concerning the manner in which the action taken affected the plaintiff-employee\") (citing <i>Rivera-Jiménez v. Pierluisi,</i> 362 F.3d 87, 94 (1st Cir.2004)); <i>see also </i><i>Granfield v. CSX Transp., Inc.,</i> 597 F.3d 474, 482 (1st Cir.2010)(in considering the denial of a party's motion for judgment as a matter of law, appellate courts \"examine the evidence presented to the jury, and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from such evidence, in the light most favorable to the jury verdict\").</p>\n<p>[9]  In any event, Morales's various contentions lack merit. Our independent review of Morales's submissions to the EEOC reveal that Morales did, in fact, include in a formal complaint the additional allegation that his tires were punctured on two occasions while his car was parked in the Caparra Heights station employee parking lot. At the trial, Morales put into evidence a sworn declaration from a co-worker, Samuel Cora-Rivera, which stated that Cora-Rivera had heard that Morales's tires were punctured by a Caparra Heights supervisor as an act of retaliation. On that basis, Morales misleadingly asserts that, because these incidents were included in a formal EEOC complaint and were proven to be retaliatory, we should consider these acts \"adverse employment actions\" for purposes of his retaliation claim. Morales fails to point out, however, that Cora-Rivera testified at the trial and unambiguously retracted his statements in the declaration, stating that \"[a]ll of the paragraphs [in the sworn statement] are not true.\" We do not consider this incident in our analysis of Morales's Title VII claims.</p>\n<p>[10]  The jury instructions provided, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>Pursuant to the Opinion of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ..., plaintiff Morales's Title VII cause of action is limited to those discrimination and retaliation allegations in his amended complaint that were previously the subject of a formal EEO complaint, to wit;</p>\n<p>1. Morales' allegation that Job Bid #2541417 was posted with Thursday/Sunday rest days rather than Saturday/Sunday rest days in retaliation for plaintiff's OSHA complaints;</p>\n<p>2. Morales allegation of sexual discrimination and retaliation arising on April 9, 1996 incident [sic] in which plaintiff's duties and responsibilities were awarded to a female employee and he was given window clerk duties to perform;</p>\n<p>3. Morales' allegation that the `coffee and lunch break's policy' was not applied in an equal and nondiscriminatory manner.</p>\n<p><i>See also Morales-Vallellanes v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</i> No. 97-2459, slip op. at 9 (D.P.R. Aug.27, 2008)(post-trial order discussing limitations on claims submitted to the jury).</p>\n<p>[11]  We acknowledge that, with respect to the admission of evidence, it appears that the trial court was inexplicably lax in its enforcement of its pre-trial orders, and Potter routinely failed to object at trial. Nonetheless, contrary to Morales's contentions, we do not agree that Potter is therefore estopped from asserting that the jury award was limited to the three incidents we remanded, which were clearly delineated in the pre-trial orders and instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p>[12]  In <i>Gómez-Pérez,</i> the Supreme Court held that the Americans with Disabilities Act's (ADA) federal-sector provision, which \"was patterned `directly after' Title VII's federal-sector discrimination ban,\" prohibited workplace retaliation through its substantive antidiscrimination prohibition. <i>See</i> 128 S.Ct. at 1940. Potter thus maintains that Title VII's federal-sector provision bans workplace retaliation, if at all, only if it results in an adverse \"personnel action[],\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(a), which he contends means only those actions that affect employment or alter the conditions of the workplace. We do not reach this argument because we conclude that even under the <i>Burlington Northern</i> standard Morales has failed to prove he suffered any adverse employment action.</p>\n<p>[13]  While Morales received a letter of warning for taking an extended coffee break on March 22, 2006, the letter was removed from plaintiff's file just 5 days later. This preliminary action was insufficient to support a claim of discrimination. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a)(5) (requiring agency to \"dismiss\" any administrative complaint that \"is moot or alleges that a proposal to take a personnel action, or other preliminary step to taking a personnel action, is discriminatory\").</p>\n<p>[14]  Specifically, Morales testified:\n</p>\n<p>And, in front of everyone, [López] said that, because someone had placed an EEO[C complaint], now everybody had to punch in their timecards for every time they would go out on a break, when they left on break, and when they came back. Obviously, this was a policy that the employees did not like. And so, all of them ... well, maybe not all of them, but most of them started to look at me bad.</p>\n<p>It was a very smart way of putting the employees against me.</p>\n<p>[15]  We emphasize that there was no evidence presented at trial that the rotation was permanent, or that he was divested of <i>meaningful</i> job responsibilities as a consequence. <i>Cf. </i><i>DeNovellis,</i> 124 F.3d at 306 (explaining that \"five-month assignment [of plaintiff] to a financial position for which he had no background and the concomitant deprivation of meaningful duties constituted an adverse employment action within the meaning of Title VII\"). Rather, his testimony demonstrates that he experienced the sort of temporary \"reassignment that involves only minor changes in working conditions [which] normally does not constitute an adverse employment action.\" <i>Marrero,</i> 304 F.3d at 23.</p>\n<p>[16]  Other courts confronting roughly similar circumstances have come to the same conclusion. <i>Thomas v. Potter,</i> 202 Fed.Appx. 118, 119 (7th Cir.2006) (unpublished decision)(plaintiff's assertion that shift change was undesirable or inconvenient did not rise to the level of a materially adverse employment action under <i>Burlington</i> where the plaintiff did not assert and record did not contain evidence that the plaintiff had \"a unique vulnerability that the Postal Service knew about and sought to exploit by changing his shift schedule\"); <i>Smith v. Potter,</i> 629 F.Supp.2d 644, 652 (S.D.Miss.2009)(retaliation claim alleging that USPS \"attempted to force [plaintiff] to return to working a schedule with off days of Friday and Saturday,\" which plaintiff had worked for preceding six years, did not constitute an adverse employment action under <i>Burlington Northern</i> even though plaintiff may have preferred Saturdays and Sundays off); <i>Arredondo v. Flores,</i> Civil Action No. L-05-191, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77675, 2008 WL 4450311, *6 (S.D.Tex. Sept.30, 2008) (\"Even if the <i>Burlington</i> standard applies, a change in schedule, shift, and days off, in this setting, is insufficient to establish an adverse employment action\").</p>\n<p>[17]  Even considering these incidents cumulatively, we still conclude that Morales has failed to establish that he suffered any adverse employment action within the meaning of Title VII's antiretaliation provision. <i>See </i><i>Aryain v. Wal-Mart Stores Texas LP,</i> 534 F.3d 473, 485 (5th Cir.2008) (negative treatment, undesired transfer to another department, undesirable break schedule, and assignment of more arduous and dirty jobs are not adverse employment actions in the retaliation context).</p>\n\n</div>",

Potter, the United States Postmaster General (\"Potter\"). In a prior appeal, we limited Morales to pursuing claims based on three discrete incidents that were previously the subject of formal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaints, and expressly precluded him from seeking relief for a \"plethora\" of other allegations raised for the first time in the district court. <i>See </i><i>Morales-Vallellanes v. Potter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200588\"><a href=\"/opinion/200588/morales-vallellanes-v-united-states-postal/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2003) [hereinafter <i>\"Morales I\"</i>]. Despite this limitation, the evidence presented at trial included numerous allegations of discrimination and retaliation that were well beyond the scope of our limited remand. Nonetheless, the jury was instructed that Morales could only recover for his claims based on the three specific allegations addressed in the prior appeal. On December 21, 2007, the jury returned a $500,000 lump-sum verdict in his favor, which was later reduced by way of statutory cap to $300,000. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1981a (b)(3)(D). The trial court awarded an additional $64,504 in back pay.</p>\n<p>Morales brought this appeal to challenge the sufficiency of the trial court's back pay award, as well as its decision denying him front pay. On cross appeal, Potter contends that the jury verdict cannot stand because Morales failed to prove that he suffered any materially adverse employment action capable of supporting his claims under Title VII. Potter also challenges the jury's damages award as grossly excessive and based on evidence that we previously excluded; contends that Morales was not entitled to back pay; and in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> various ways opposes Morales's contentions that his damages award was inadequate.</p>\n<p>After careful consideration, we conclude as a matter of law that Morales has failed to prove that he suffered any material adverse employment action within the meaning of Title VII's discrimination or retaliation provisions. We therefore vacate the jury verdict and remand with instructions to enter judgment in Potter's favor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Facts<sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p>We sketch only the basic facts essential to this appeal. Morales began his employment with the United States Postal Service (\"USPS\") in 1988 as a Distribution Clerk. In 1990, he was transferred to the USPS station in Caparra Heights, Puerto Rico. In 1995, Morales bid for and obtained the position of Distribution and Window Clerk. In this capacity, Morales typically performed back-office \"distribution\" duties, which included \"business reply,\" \"express mail,\" and \"postage due\" functions. Because Morales worked the early shift and had an arm injury that limited the tasks he could perform without pain, Morales rarely performed \"window\" duties, which included customer interactions; nonetheless, he was trained to do so, did so on occasion, and those tasks were part of the job description he had bid for.</p>\n<p>Beginning in approximately early 1996, Morales lodged several complaints with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regarding dust accumulation, rodent infestation, and general unsanitary conditions at the Caparra Heights station. Eventually, OSHA conducted a formal inspection and issued the USPS citations for various safety and health violations. Around the same time, Morales also filed unrelated, employment-based complaints with the EEOC. Morales alleged that his supervisors and coworkers began to take various retaliatory actions against him for filing these complaints, and to discriminate against him on account of his gender. Only three such actions are relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p>First, in January 1996 Morales expressed interest in bidding for a Distribution and Window Clerk position that was expected to come with Saturdays and Sundays off, a coveted position given that many USPS employees had an irregular weekend schedule.<sup>[2]</sup> Thereafter, the USPS reclassified the position so that, when it was posted, it came with Thursdays and Sundays off instead. On February 15, 1996, Morales filed a precomplaint with the EEOC alleging that this reclassification was in retaliation for various complaints he had filed, including with the EEOC.<sup>[3]</sup> He alleged that the reclassification was intended <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> to dissuade him from bidding for the position.</p>\n<p>Second, on March 23, 1996 Morales's supervisor issued him a letter of warning for unsatisfactory performance due to an \"abuse of coffee breaks,\" which was withdrawn from his personnel file about a week later. On April 25, 1996, Morales filed a second precomplaint with the EEOC alleging that a new coffee and lunch break policy at the Caparra Heights station unlawfully discriminated against male employees. Specifically, he complained that a female employee, Mayra Irene, was allowed to take longer breaks than permitted under the policy, while male employees were not. He also alleged that on one occasion, his supervisor took Mayra Irene and another female administrative employee out to lunch, but returned late in violation of the policy.</p>\n<p>Third, on April 9, 1996<sup>[4]</sup> Morales's business reply mail, postage due, and express mail duties were temporarily reassigned to a female employee, again Mayra Irene, while he was given \"window\" duties to perform. Morales complained to the EEOC regarding this rotation of responsibilities, alleging that it was discriminatory and in retaliation for his previous complaints.</p>\n<p>All three incidents were the subject of formal EEOC complaints which made their way through the administrative process, and were ultimately dismissed. <i>See </i><i>Morales I,</i> 339 F.3d at 18.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Proceedings Below</h2>\n<p>In 1997 Morales brought suit in the district court alleging that USPS officials had retaliated against him for his various EEOC complaints and had discriminated against him on the basis of his gender; that the USPS and Postal Workers Union officials breached their obligations under a collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\"); and that he suffered an intentional infliction of emotional distress at defendant's hands. The district court granted summary judgment in Potter's favor on all claims.</p>\n<p>In <i>Morales I,</i> we affirmed the district court in most respects, but disagreed with its conclusion that the acts of discrimination and retaliation Morales had alleged as violations of the CBA were not actionable under Title VII. We determined, however, that many of the allegations of harassment and retaliation Morales relied on to support his federal claims had never been the subject of a formal complaint to the EEOC, and were therefore barred by Title VII's administrative exhaustion requirement. Accordingly, we remanded for the limited purpose of considering Morales's allegations of discrimination and retaliation arising out of the three incidents described above, which were addressed in the EEOC dismissal letters. Because no court had analyzed Morales's claims based on these events under the Title VII rubric, we declined to independently undertake that assessment and instead left that task to the district court in the first instance. We instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Morales is precluded on remand from seeking relief for a plethora of other acts of discrimination and retaliation alleged in his amended complaint, including the discrete acts of bullying, intimidation, and vandalism by his co-workers, his seven-day suspension for violating the USPS uniform policy, his transfer from the Caparra Heights station, his day-long \"expulsions\" from work in February <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> 1997, his constructive discharge, and his internal grievances against [the Postal Workers Union].</blockquote>\n<p><i>Morales I,</i> 339 F.3d at 19.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Following our remand, the defendants moved for summary judgment on the theory that Morales's remaining allegations failed as a matter of law to rise to the level of retaliation or discrimination within the meaning of Title VII, but the district court denied the motion in a margin order, which specified that the trial would be \"limited to the three issues which survived appeal.\"<sup>[6]</sup> Thereafter, the case was referred to a magistrate judge for trial, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. § 636, who, in a series of pre-trial orders, made it clear that the evidence presented at trial, and the claims submitted to the jury, would be limited to the three specific incidents identified in our prior opinion.</p>\n<p>Morales testified at the trial, which lasted eight days. Much of his testimony and the evidence presented veered well beyond the clear lines drawn in our prior opinion and the trial court's various orders. Thus, Morales told the jury about discrete acts of vandalism by his coworkers, including that they punctured his tires and poured sugar in his gas tank.</p>\n<p>He described numerous acts of bullying and intimidation in the workplace. Among other things, he testified that his supervisors engaged in a campaign of harassment and retaliation by \"put[ting] the employees against\" him; that things became \"really tense\" in the office when he was investigated \"for some supposed death threat [he] had given to another employee;\" that the \"environment became extremely violent against him;\" that he \"started receiving threats from other employees;\" and that eleven coworkers wrote a letter accusing him of \"always playing games physically with other employees in events where he kisses them or touches them by massaging their backs and necks.\" The letter was read into evidence.</p>\n<p>Morales also told the jury that he was suspended for seven days for violating the USPS uniform policy. He testified that he was transferred from the Caparra Heights station because he \"was allegedly a safety hazard and/or supposedly a homosexual.\" Morales's counsel questioned a former supervisor about Morales's day-long expulsions from work in February 1996, about his seven-day suspension for alleged violations of the uniform policy, and about whether Morales acted like a \"homosexual man.\"</p>\n<p>Morales spoke at length about the emotional distress he suffered as a result of ongoing discrimination and retaliation he endured at the USPS. He explained, \"[T]he discrimination became something of everyday. I lost sleep. I spent days that I was on alert without sleeping, thinking about what new thing they're going to come up with the next day, what new thing.\" His treating physician, Dr. Hoyos, opined that Morales suffered from an adjustment disorder caused by the cumulative effect of multiple stressors in the workplace. Of the ten stressors specifically identified by Dr. Hoyos, the allegedly discriminatory coffee break policy and rotation of window duties incident, combined, were a single stressor. The altered job posting was not identified as contributing to Morales's adjustment disorder.</p>\n<p>In its charge, the trial court instructed the jury that it could only compensate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> Morales for the three specific incidents identified in our prior opinion. The verdict form which the jury returned indicated generally that it had found Potter liable for both discrimination and retaliation, but it did not apportion the damages award among the specific claims. Later, on Morales's motion, the court awarded back payoffset by the amount of disability payments plaintiff had been receiving since 1997, when Morales began to collect disability payments<sup>[7]</sup>and denied his request for front pay.</p>\n<p>Both parties filed post-trial motions. Morales challenged the court's back pay award as too low, as well as its denial of his motion seeking front pay. Potter filed motions for judgment as a matter of law on account of Morales's alleged failure to prove actionable discrimination or retaliation; for remittitur or, in the alternative, a new damages trial; and challenging the back pay award. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 50, 59(a), (e). The district court denied Potter's motions, but granted in part Morales's motion seeking additional back pay due to a computational error in the original judgment. Both parties filed timely appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review <i>de novo</i> the district court's denial of a defendant's motion for judgment as a matter of law. <i>Rodríguez-Torres v. Caribbean Forms Mfr., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201463\"><a href=\"/opinion/201463/rodriguez-torres-v-caribbean-forms/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir.2005). Potter's primary challenge focuses on the legal sufficiency of Morales's claims alleging discrimination and retaliation. He contends Morales has failed to prove that he suffered any materially \"adverse employment action.\" Often, whether an employee has suffered a materially adverse employment action capable of supporting claims under Title VII is a question of law for the court. <i>See </i><i>Bergeron v. Cabral,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203715\"><a href=\"/opinion/203715/bergeron-v-cabral/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 n. 1 (1st Cir.2009)(explaining that \"the adversity vel non of that action is a legal question\"); <i>DeNovellis v. Shalala,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746214\"><a href=\"/opinion/746214/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1520-72-empl-prac-dec-p-45029-vincent/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 312 (1st Cir.1997)(characterizing as a \"legal question\" whether plaintiff's \"sham assignment constituted an adverse employment action within the meaning of Title VII\").<sup>[8]</sup> In this analysis, we assume that the motivation for the employer's acts was discriminatory or retaliatory, and look only to the statutory significance of the harm these acts caused. <i>Cf. Burlington Northern,</i> 548 U.S. at 70, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2405</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> B. The Scope of the Claims</h2>\n<p>As a threshold matter, the parties dispute the scope of the claims under review. Potter maintains that the claims are limited to the three incidents described in our prior opinion, while Morales asserts that, for various reasons, the claims submitted to the jury encompassed all of the \"plethora\" of unexhausted allegations which we excluded in the first appeal. One problem with Morales's argument is that the trial court's orders in limine, instructions to the jury, and discussion of Morales's claims in its post-trial order were all consistent with the limitation in our prior opinion. Though Morales contends that the district court ultimately agreed with his reading of the scope of the claims, he has identified nothing in the record to support that assertion.</p>\n<p>Another problem with Morales's contention is that our holding in <i>Morales I</i> limiting his claims to the three incidents we have described is \"the law of the case.\" <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v.

We have recognized limited exceptions to the application of this doctrine, <i>see </i><i>Vigneau,</i> 337 F.3d at 68, but Morales never argued to the trial court that any of these limited exceptions should apply, and he does not do so here. This failure to confront the implications of our prior holding essentially forecloses Morales's attempt, raised for the first time in his opposition to Potter's cross-appeal, to broaden the scope of the claims now under review.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, while the trial court may have allowed Morales to introduce a broad range of evidence relating to his experience at the Caparra Heights station, including evidence relating to his excluded allegations, the jury was instructed that it could only compensate him for the three specific incidents that we remanded.<sup>[10]</sup> \"A <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> basic premise of our jury system is that the jury follows the court's instructions,\" and therefore we assume, as we must, that the jury acted according to its charge. <i>Refuse &amp; Envtl.

Minor disruptions in the workplace, including \"petty slights, minor annoyances, and simple lack of good manners,\" fail to qualify. <i>Burlington Northern,</i> 548 U.S. at 68, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2405</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Morales's Claims</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. The Coffee and Lunch Break Policy</h2>\n<p>The first set of claims brought by Morales, alleging both discrimination and retaliation, arises from his allegation that the Caparra Heights coffee and lunch break policy was not enforced in an equal and nondiscriminatory matter, insofar as certain female employees were, at times, permitted to take longer breaks than the policy provided for. Under the policy, employees were allowed to take either a half <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> hour or an hour lunch break, plus a ten minute coffee break during each half of their shift. When Morales complained about the discriminatory enforcement of the policy, his supervisor began to require all employees to clock in and out each time they took a break.</p>\n<p>However, even if two female employees were permitted to take longer breaks than Morales on account of their gender, such selective enforcement of the breaks policy had no material effect on Morales's employment and therefore cannot constitute discrimination within the meaning of the statute. He was not formally disciplined for violating the policy,<sup>[13]</sup> or denied the opportunity to take breaks himself. On these facts, we hold that the selective enforcement of the breaks policy fails to sustain a claim for gender discrimination.</p>\n<p>Likewise, we conclude that the selective enforcement of the breaks policy fails to rise to level of actionable retaliation. Morales's retaliation claim includes an allegation that, following the submission of an EEOC complaint, his supervisor, Enrique López, closely monitored the lunch and coffee breaks Morales took. He also testified that, by requiring that all employees clock in and out each time they went on break, López attempted to stir up other employees against him.<sup>[14]</sup> Morales, however, was not treated differently than other employees in the application of the policy as a result of his complaint; indeed, his complaint rests on the assertion that all employees were treated equally (though they may not have liked it). Thus, the adverse action anchoring Morales's complaint of retaliation is essentially the relief he requested in his discrimination complaint, and therefore would not dissuade a reasonable employee from filing or supporting a charge of discrimination. <i>Cf. Burlington Northern,</i> 548 U.S. at 68, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2405</span></a></span> (\"An employee's decision to report discriminatory behavior cannot immunize that employee from those petty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience.\").</p>\n<p>Accordingly, Morales's claims arising from the selective enforcement of the breaks policy fail as a matter of law because Morales suffered no material adverse employment action within the meaning of Title VII's discrimination or retaliation provisions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Rotation of Responsibilities</h2>\n<p>Next, Morales asserts claims for both discrimination and retaliation arising from the \"incident in which plaintiff's duties and responsibilities were awarded to a female employee and he was given window clerk duties to perform.\" <i>Morales I,</i> 339 F.3d at 18. We hold that this temporary rotation of Morales's preferred distribution duties to a female clerk fails to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> qualify as an adverse employment action for purposes of either claim.</p>\n<p>Morales was required to perform \"window\" duties rather than \"distribution\" duties for only a limited period of time, those duties fell within his job description (indeed, which he bid for), and there was evidence that on other, albeit rare, occasions he had performed \"window\" duties in the normal course of his employment. <i>Cf. </i><i>Butler v. Ala. Dep't of Transp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78064\"><a href=\"/opinion/78064/butler-v-alabama-dept-of-transp/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1209</span></a></span>, 1215 (11th Cir.2008) (\"Requiring an employee to perform her job is not a change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of her employment.\"). Morales himself testified that, \"I was trained for [window duties]. I could do [them]. I was prepared to do [them].\" Such a minor disruption in the tasks Morales preferred to perform cannot, as a matter of law, sustain his claim for damages under Title VII's antidiscrimination provision. <i>See </i><i>Marrero,</i> 304 F.3d at 23 (secretary's permanent, lateral reassignment to work in same capacity for different boss did not rise to level of an adverse employment action where \"her general job description and salary remained the same,\" notwithstanding the fact that she \"was required to do more work, subjected to `extreme supervision,' and forced to undergo a period of probation\"); <i>see also </i><i>Washington v. Ill. Dep't of Revenue,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791608\"><a href=\"/opinion/791608/chrissie-washington-v-illinois-department-of-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span>, 661 (7th Cir.2005) (explaining that \"a lateral transfer that does not affect pay (or significantly affect working conditions) cannot be called discriminatory\").<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>Nor can this temporary rotation of responsibilities qualify as an adverse employment action for purposes of his retaliation claim. In appropriate circumstances, disadvantageous work assignments may qualify as materially adverse, but Morales's temporary reassignment is a far cry from those situations where we have found actionable retaliation. <i>See generally </i><i>Valentín-Almeyda v. Municipality of Aguadilla,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202202\"><a href=\"/opinion/202202/valentin-v-mun-of-aquadilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, 95 (1st Cir.2006) (finding a totality of assignments, which included a police officer's transfer for an \"unusually long\" duration to a \"remote and solitary\" duty site that was \"regarded as punishment\" by officers, to constitute adverse employment action).</p>\n<p>While Morales testified that the window duties presented certain \"physical difficulties\" in light of his arm condition, he made it crystal clear that he was able to perform those duties \"as long as it was not for a long time\" and he did not state that he experienced any unique hardship as a result of performing \"window\" tasks. There is no evidence that window duties were more difficult, less prestigious, or objectively inferior to Morales's distribution duties; rather, the gravamen of Morales's complaint is that he preferred his regular assignment. <i>Compare Burlington Northern,</i> 548 U.S. at 71, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2405</span></a></span> (holding that permanent reassignment of a female forklift operator to track laborer was a materially adverse action where there was \"considerable evidence that the track laborer duties were `by all accounts more arduous and dirtier'; that the `forklift operator position required more qualifications, which is an indication of prestige'; and that `the forklift operator position was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> objectively considered a better job and the male employees resented [the plaintiff] for occupying it'\").</p>\n<p>Under the circumstances, we hold that the temporary rotation of Morales preferred window duties does not qualify as materially adverse and cannot support his claims under Title VII.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. The Altered Job Posting</h2>\n<p>Morales's final claim, alleging retaliation only, focuses on the altered job posting. He maintains that, because he filed a complaint with the EEOC, the USPS changed the days off that were expected to come with a certain Distribution and Window Clerk position when it was posted for bidding. There is no dispute that the only difference between Morales's position at the time of this incident and the position in which he expressed an interest was that the new posting was expected to come with Saturdays and Sundays off, but was ultimately posted with Thursdays and Sundays off instead. We conclude that this alteration of rest days was insufficient to dissuade a reasonable employee from filing or supporting a charge of discrimination.</p>\n<p>In appropriate circumstances, not present here, a schedule change may operate to dissuade a reasonable employee from reporting workplace discrimination. <i>See Burlington Northern,</i> 548 U.S. at 69, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2405</span></a></span>. In this case, however, there is no indication in the record that changing the days off associated with the new posting affected Morales any more than it did other eligible bidders. <i>See </i><i>Lockridge,</i> 597 F.3d at 473 (no adverse employment action where denial of office space \"left [the employee] in no worse a position than that held by similarly situated faculty members\"). Moreover, there is no evidence that Morales suffered any undue hardship as a result of continuing to have Sundays and Mondays, rather than Sundays and Saturdays, off. <i>See Burlington Northern,</i> 548 U.S. at 69, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2405</span></a></span> (explaining that \"[a] schedule change in an employee's work schedule may make little difference to many workers, [but] may matter enormously to a young mother with school-age children\"); <i>see also </i><i>Washington,</i> 420 F.3d at 662 (finding flex-time schedule critical to employee with disabled child, and recognizing that actions \"that would be harmless to most people [may] do real damage to select targets\"). Rather, Morales testified that, as a result of the rotation, he continued to have Sundays and Mondays off rather than a normal weekend schedule, which he would have preferred. This is plainly insufficient to support a claim for retaliation under the statute. <i>Cf. </i><i>Hughes v. Stottlemyre,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795013\"><a href=\"/opinion/795013/david-hughes-v-roger-d-stottlemyre-colonel-in-his-official-capacity/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span>, 797 (8th Cir. 2006) (no actionable retaliation where there was \"no evidence to suggest [employee] suffered a materially significant disadvantage by having to work more Sundays and Wednesdays,\" rather than his preferred schedule).<sup>[16]</sup> We note that Morales's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> own medical expert failed to identify the altered job posting as a stressor contributing to his adjustment disorder.</p>\n<p>Thus, after careful consideration, we conclude that Morales has failed to prove that he suffered any adverse employment action capable of supporting his claims for discrimination or retaliation.<sup>[17]</sup> Accordingly, we vacate the verdict and remand to the district court with instructions to enter judgment as a matter of law in Potter's favor. No costs are awarded.</p>\n<p><i>Vacated and Remanded.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Additional detail regarding Morales's allegations can be found in our prior opinion. <i>See </i><i>Morales I,</i> 339 F.3d at 12-14.</p>\n<p>[2]  At the time, Morales had Sundays and Mondays off. Morales testified that at some point in 1996, he was given Saturday and Sundays off instead.</p>\n<p>[3]  The EEO complaint process provides an administrative forum for postal employees to resolve discrimination claims against the USPS. Postal workers alleging discrimination are required to file a \"precomplaint\" and consult with an EEO counselor. If the matter raised in the precomplaint is not resolved within the established 30-day counseling period, the employee is authorized to file a formal EEO complaint. Once the formal complaint is filed, USPS is compelled to take action within a specified time period. After this period expires, the employee is permitted to file suit in United States District Court.\n</p>\n<p><i>Morales I,</i> 339 F.3d at 13.</p>\n<p>[4]  Contrary to his initial allegations, Morales testified that this incident may have occurred in May 1996.</p>\n<p>[5]  Morales moved for panel reconsideration, which was denied.</p>\n<p>[6]  The district court did not address the merits of Potter's legal challenge, concluding instead that whether Morales suffered actionable discrimination or retaliation \"involve[d] factual issues, as well as matters of credibility and weight of the evidence.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  Since that time, Morales has received approximately 66.33% of his USPS salary through the U.S. Department of Labor's Workers' Compensation Program. He technically remains a USPS employee.</p>\n<p>[8]  With respect to Morales's claims of retaliation, we are mindful that \"the significance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon the particular circumstances\" of each case. <i>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. v.

Thus, we review the factual circumstances bearing on the legal significance of these actions in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>Cf. </i><i>Bergeron,</i> 560 F.3d at 6 n. 1 (noting that \"the existence of an adverse employment action may be a question for the jury when there is a dispute concerning the manner in which the action taken affected the plaintiff-employee\") (citing <i>Rivera-Jiménez v. Pierluisi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200933\"><a href=\"/opinion/200933/rivera-jimenez-v-pierluisi/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 94 (1st Cir.2004)); <i>see also </i><i>Granfield v.

Our independent review of Morales's submissions to the EEOC reveal that Morales did, in fact, include in a formal complaint the additional allegation that his tires were punctured on two occasions while his car was parked in the Caparra Heights station employee parking lot. At the trial, Morales put into evidence a sworn declaration from a co-worker, Samuel Cora-Rivera, which stated that Cora-Rivera had heard that Morales's tires were punctured by a Caparra Heights supervisor as an act of retaliation. On that basis, Morales misleadingly asserts that, because these incidents were included in a formal EEOC complaint and were proven to be retaliatory, we should consider these acts \"adverse employment actions\" for purposes of his retaliation claim. Morales fails to point out, however, that Cora-Rivera testified at the trial and unambiguously retracted his statements in the declaration, stating that \"[a]ll of the paragraphs [in the sworn statement] are not true.\" We do not consider this incident in our analysis of Morales's Title VII claims.</p>\n<p>[10]  The jury instructions provided, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>Pursuant to the Opinion of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ..., plaintiff Morales's Title VII cause of action is limited to those discrimination and retaliation allegations in his amended complaint that were previously the subject of a formal EEO complaint, to wit;</p>\n<p>1. Morales' allegation that Job Bid #2541417 was posted with Thursday/Sunday rest days rather than Saturday/Sunday rest days in retaliation for plaintiff's OSHA complaints;</p>\n<p>2. Morales allegation of sexual discrimination and retaliation arising on April 9, 1996 incident [sic] in which plaintiff's duties and responsibilities were awarded to a female employee and he was given window clerk duties to perform;</p>\n<p>3. Morales' allegation that the `coffee and lunch break's policy' was not applied in an equal and nondiscriminatory manner.</p>\n<p><i>See also Morales-Vallellanes v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</i> No. 97-2459, slip op. at 9 (D.P.R. Aug.27, 2008)(post-trial order discussing limitations on claims submitted to the jury).</p>\n<p>[11]  We acknowledge that, with respect to the admission of evidence, it appears that the trial court was inexplicably lax in its enforcement of its pre-trial orders, and Potter routinely failed to object at trial. Nonetheless, contrary to Morales's contentions, we do not agree that Potter is therefore estopped from asserting that the jury award was limited to the three incidents we remanded, which were clearly delineated in the pre-trial orders and instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p>[12]  In <i>Gómez-Pérez,</i> the Supreme Court held that the Americans with Disabilities Act's (ADA) federal-sector provision, which \"was patterned `directly after' Title VII's federal-sector discrimination ban,\" prohibited workplace retaliation through its substantive antidiscrimination prohibition. <i>See</i> 128 S.Ct. at 1940. Potter thus maintains that Title VII's federal-sector provision bans workplace retaliation, if at all, only if it results in an adverse \"personnel action[],\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(a), which he contends means only those actions that affect employment or alter the conditions of the workplace. We do not reach this argument because we conclude that even under the <i>Burlington Northern</i> standard Morales has failed to prove he suffered any adverse employment action.</p>\n<p>[13]  While Morales received a letter of warning for taking an extended coffee break on March 22, 2006, the letter was removed from plaintiff's file just 5 days later. This preliminary action was insufficient to support a claim of discrimination. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a)(5) (requiring agency to \"dismiss\" any administrative complaint that \"is moot or alleges that a proposal to take a personnel action, or other preliminary step to taking a personnel action, is discriminatory\").</p>\n<p>[14]  Specifically, Morales testified:\n</p>\n<p>And, in front of everyone, [López] said that, because someone had placed an EEO[C complaint], now everybody had to punch in their timecards for every time they would go out on a break, when they left on break, and when they came back. Obviously, this was a policy that the employees did not like. And so, all of them ... well, maybe not all of them, but most of them started to look at me bad.</p>\n<p>It was a very smart way of putting the employees against me.</p>\n<p>[15]  We emphasize that there was no evidence presented at trial that the rotation was permanent, or that he was divested of <i>meaningful</i> job responsibilities as a consequence. <i>Cf. </i><i>DeNovellis,</i> 124 F.3d at 306 (explaining that \"five-month assignment [of plaintiff] to a financial position for which he had no background and the concomitant deprivation of meaningful duties constituted an adverse employment action within the meaning of Title VII\"). Rather, his testimony demonstrates that he experienced the sort of temporary \"reassignment that involves only minor changes in working conditions [which] normally does not constitute an adverse employment action.\" <i>Marrero,</i> 304 F.3d at 23.</p>\n<p>[16]  Other courts confronting roughly similar circumstances have come to the same conclusion. <i>Thomas v. Potter,</i> 202 Fed.Appx. 118, 119 (7th Cir.2006) (unpublished decision)(plaintiff's assertion that shift change was undesirable or inconvenient did not rise to the level of a materially adverse employment action under <i>Burlington</i> where the plaintiff did not assert and record did not contain evidence that the plaintiff had \"a unique vulnerability that the Postal Service knew about and sought to exploit by changing his shift schedule\"); <i>Smith v. Potter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1576959\"><a href=\"/opinion/1576959/smith-v-potter/\"><span class=\"volume\">629</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span>, 652 (S.D.Miss.2009)(retaliation claim alleging that USPS \"attempted to force [plaintiff] to return to working a schedule with off days of Friday and Saturday,\" which plaintiff had worked for preceding six years, did not constitute an adverse employment action under <i>Burlington Northern</i> even though plaintiff may have preferred Saturdays and Sundays off); <i>Arredondo v. Flores,</i> Civil Action No. L-05-191, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">77675</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4450311</span></span>, *6 (S.D.Tex. Sept.30, 2008) (\"Even if the <i>Burlington</i> standard applies, a change in schedule, shift, and days off, in this setting, is insufficient to establish an adverse employment action\").</p>\n<p>[17]  Even considering these incidents cumulatively, we still conclude that Morales has failed to establish that he suffered any adverse employment action within the meaning of Title VII's antiretaliation provision. <i>See </i><i>Aryain v. Wal-Mart Stores Texas LP,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"62950\"><a href=\"/opinion/62950/aryain-v-wal-mart-stores-texas-lp/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span>, 485 (5th Cir.2008) (negative treatment, undesired transfer to another department, undesirable break schedule, and assignment of more arduous and dirty jobs are not adverse employment actions in the retaliation context).</p>\n\n</div>",
