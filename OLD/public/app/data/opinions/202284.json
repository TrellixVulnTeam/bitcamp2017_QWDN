This is an appeal by four co-defendants--\n\nJesús Manuel Díaz Correa (\"Díaz\"), Jorge D. López-Encarnación\n\n(\"López\"), José M. Morales-Boria (\"Morales\"), and Zilkia Marrero-\n\nVargas (\"Marrero\")--from sentences imposed after they pled guilty\n\nto conspiring to commit credit card fraud and other related\n\ncrimes.    All defendants seek resentencing under United States v.\n\nBooker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005). In addition, defendants Morales and\n\nLópez challenge their sentences on other grounds.                        For the\n\nreasons    discussed   below,    we   vacate     all   of     the   defendants'\n\nsentences and remand for resentencing under Booker.\n\nA.     Booker Claims\n\n            As the government correctly concedes, all defendants\n\npreserved    their   Booker     arguments   by    arguing       below    that   the\n\nGuidelines were unconstitutional under Blakely v. Washington, 542\n\nU.S. 296 (2004). See United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68,\n\n74 (1st Cir. 2005).       Accordingly, we review              defendants' Booker\n\nclaims for harmless error.        United States v. Fornia-Castillo, 408\n\nF.3d 52, 73 (1st Cir. 2005).          Under that standard, \"to avoid a\n\nremand for resentencing under advisory Guidelines, 'the government\n\nhas the burden of proving . . . that the error did not affect the\n\ndefendant[s'] substantial rights.           That is, we must be convinced\n\nthat   a   lower   sentence   would   not    have      been    imposed    had   the\n\nGuidelines been advisory.'\" Id. (quoting United States v. Vázquez-\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fRivera, 407 F.3d 476, 490 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 279\n\n(2005)).\n\n                  Here, for all but one defendant,1 Díaz, the government\n\ndoes not even attempt to show that the district court would have\n\nimposed the same sentence under the advisory Guidelines and other\n\nstatutory factors.            As to Díaz, the government argues that the\n\nsentence was driven, not by the mandatory Guidelines, but by the\n\nparties' stipulations in the plea agreement, which the court simply\n\nadopted.          But those stipulations, entered into pre-Booker, dealt\n\nonly with the Guidelines calculations and therefore provide no\n\ninsight into what the district court would have done if the\n\nGuidelines         were   not    mandatory      and   other    factors   were      also\n\nconsidered.           Indeed, at sentencing, Díaz's counsel specifically\n\nasked       the    district     judge   how    he   would   sentence   Díaz   if    the\n\nGuidelines were declared unconstitutional, but the judge declined\n\nto answer that hypothetical question.                 If anything, the fact that\n\nthe court adopted the parties' recommendation to sentence Díaz at\n\nthe bottom of the applicable Guidelines range is an indication that\n\n\n\n        1\n      We reject the government's argument that all defendants\nexcept Díaz waived the benefit of the harmless error standard by\nnot expressly invoking it in their briefs. Nor did the defendants\nwaive their Booker claims by stipulating to certain Guidelines\ncalculations in their plea agreements, as the government further\ncontends. While such stipulations may be binding as to particular\nGuidelines calculations, United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix, 400\nF.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 106 (2005), they\ndo not preclude a defendant from seeking resentencing under a\nscheme where the Guidelines calculations are not dispositive.\n\n                                              -3-\n\fthe court might have imposed an even lower sentence if it had the\n\ndiscretion to do so.    Vázquez-Rivera, 407 F.3d at 490.     Under those\n\ncircumstances, we are not convinced that the district court would\n\nhave imposed the same sentence absent the mandatory nature of the\n\nGuidelines. Cf. United States v. Benedetti, 433 F.3d 111, 119 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (finding Booker error harmless where the court stated\n\nthat it would apply \"exactly the same sentence\" if the Guidelines\n\nwere unconstitutional). Similarly, as to the remaining defendants,\n\nnothing in the record indicates that the sentencing judge would\n\nhave imposed the same sentences if he were not bound by the\n\nGuidelines.\n\n            Accordingly, we conclude that the government has failed\n\nto meet its burden of demonstrating harmless error and therefore\n\nvacate and remand all defendants' sentences for resentencing under\n\nBooker, using the protocols endorsed in United States v. Jiménez-\n\nBeltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518-19 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).           \"[O]ur\n\ndecision to remand should not be read as a 'suggestion or a\n\nprediction    that   [defendants']   sentence[s]   will   necessarily   be\n\naltered.'    This is especially true 'where . . . the harmless error\n\ntest[] makes even a modest possibility of change enough to warrant\n\nremand.'\"     United States v. Gómez-Rosario, 418 F.3d 90, 109 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fB.   Other Claims\n\n           Because Morales will be resentenced under Booker, his\n\nprocedural challenges to his sentencing proceedings--that the court\n\nrefused   to   consider   his    illegible    written     objections     to   the\n\npresentence report and refused to grant his motion to continue the\n\nsentencing hearing--are moot and therefore need not be considered.\n\nHowever, to guide the district court in resentencing Morales and\n\nLopez, we will address their substantive challenges to their\n\nGuideline calculations.         United States v. Green, 426 F.3d 64, 66\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           Morales's      substantive       challenge      focuses      on    the\n\ncalculation    of   the   amount     of    loss    and    number   of   victims\n\nattributable to him for sentencing purposes.              He claims that the\n\ndistrict court erred in basing his sentence on the total amount of\n\nloss (more than $400,000) and total number of victims (between 10\n\nand 50) attributable to the entire conspiracy, rather than on the\n\nsmaller quantities involved in the overt acts with which he was\n\ncharged or otherwise evidenced by materials provided in discovery.\n\n           The district court correctly rejected that argument and\n\nheld Morales to the Guidelines calculations that he stipulated to\n\nin his plea agreement, which were expressly based on the $400,000\n\nloss amount and the 10-to-50 victims.             As we   recently reiterated\n\nin a decision involving another co-defendant in this same case,\n\n\"[o]rdinarily, a defendant can be held to such stipulations.\"\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fUnited States v. Rodríguez-González, 433 F.3d 165, 167 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (citing United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 28 (1st Cir.\n\n2001)).     In this case, unlike in Rodríguez-González, there is no\n\nclaim   that    the    defendant   joined      the   conspiracy    late,   so   the\n\nprinciple      that   a   late-joining    member     of   a   conspiracy   is   not\n\nresponsible, for sentencing purposes, for conduct of his co-\n\nconspirators before he joined, id. at 168, has no bearing here.\n\nNor does the record here evidence any confusion on the judge's part\n\nas to the applicable standard.           Cf. id. at 168-69.\n\n            López argues that, in determining his criminal history\n\ncategory, the district court erred in counting one of his prior\n\nconvictions.          In reviewing this claim of Guidelines error, the\n\npre-Booker standards of review still apply; the district court's\n\ninterpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo and its\n\nrelated factual findings are reviewed for clear error.                     United\n\nStates v. Robinson, 433 F.3d 31, 35, 38 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Specifically, López claims that his March 2003 state\n\nconviction for attempting to cash a false check should not have\n\nbeen counted in computing his criminal history score because that\n\nconviction was \"part of the instant offense,\" within the meaning of\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A.1.2.          The district court rejected that argument,\n\nreasoning that the prior conviction for check fraud was for a\n\ndifferent offense, more akin to bank fraud, than the instant\n\nconviction for credit card fraud.\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f          In so concluding, the district court does not appear to\n\nhave considered several other factors relevant to whether the prior\n\noffense was \"part of\" the instant one, including whether the\n\noffenses are \"'substantially connected to each other by at least\n\none common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices,\n\ncommon purpose, or similar modus operandi.'\"      United States v.\n\nCollazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d 163, 203 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 1B1.3 comment. (n.9(A)2)), vacated on other grounds, 532 U.S.\n\n1036 (2001).      While \"[t]he nature of the offenses may also be a\n\nrelevant consideration,\" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3 comment. (n.9(B)), it is\n\nnot dispositive, id.    The district court cannot therefore rely on\n\nthat single factor without considering the other factors.    Because\n\ndetermining whether a prior offense is part of the instant offense\n\nis \"necessarily a fact-specific inquiry,\" id. (quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted); see also Troncoso, 23 F.3d at 616, we leave that\n\ndetermination to the district court in the first instance.\n\n               All of the appellants' sentences are vacated and the\n\nmatter is remanded to the district court for resentencing in\n\naccordance with this opinion.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n     2\n      This application note--rather than application note 3, which\ndescribes the circumstances under which prior sentences are\n\"related\" to each other--is the one that applies here. See United\nStates v. Cyr, 337 F.3d 96, 99 n.1 (1st Cir. 2003); United States\nv. Troncoso, 23 F.3d 612, 616 n.4 (1st Cir. 1994).              The\ngovernment's reliance on application note 3 is therefore misplaced.\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f",

Indeed, at sentencing, Díaz's counsel specifically\n\nasked       the    district     judge   how    he   would   sentence   Díaz   if    the\n\nGuidelines were declared unconstitutional, but the judge declined\n\nto answer that hypothetical question.                 If anything, the fact that\n\nthe court adopted the parties' recommendation to sentence Díaz at\n\nthe bottom of the applicable Guidelines range is an indication that\n\n\n\n        1\n      We reject the government's argument that all defendants\nexcept Díaz waived the benefit of the harmless error standard by\nnot expressly invoking it in their briefs. Nor did the defendants\nwaive their Booker claims by stipulating to certain Guidelines\ncalculations in their plea agreements, as the government further\ncontends. While such stipulations may be binding as to particular\nGuidelines calculations, United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201470\"><a href=\"/opinion/201470/united-states-v-serrano-beauvaix/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 54 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Vázquez-Rivera, 407 F.3d at 490.     Under those\n\ncircumstances, we are not convinced that the district court would\n\nhave imposed the same sentence absent the mandatory nature of the\n\nGuidelines. Cf. United States v. Benedetti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201980\"><a href=\"/opinion/201980/united-states-v-benedetti/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 119 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (finding Booker error harmless where the court stated\n\nthat it would apply \"exactly the same sentence\" if the Guidelines\n\nwere unconstitutional). Similarly, as to the remaining defendants,\n\nnothing in the record indicates that the sentencing judge would\n\nhave imposed the same sentences if he were not bound by the\n\nGuidelines.\n\n            Accordingly, we conclude that the government has failed\n\nto meet its burden of demonstrating harmless error and therefore\n\nvacate and remand all defendants' sentences for resentencing under\n\nBooker, using the protocols endorsed in United States v. Jiménez-\n\nBeltre, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 518-19 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).           \"[O]ur\n\ndecision to remand should not be read as a 'suggestion or a\n\nprediction    that   [defendants']   sentence[s]   will   necessarily   be\n\naltered.'

Other Claims\n\n           Because Morales will be resentenced under Booker, his\n\nprocedural challenges to his sentencing proceedings--that the court\n\nrefused   to   consider   his    illegible    written     objections     to   the\n\npresentence report and refused to grant his motion to continue the\n\nsentencing hearing--are moot and therefore need not be considered.\n\nHowever, to guide the district court in resentencing Morales and\n\nLopez, we will address their substantive challenges to their\n\nGuideline calculations.         United States v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201860\"><a href=\"/opinion/201860/united-states-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 66\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           Morales's      substantive       challenge      focuses      on    the\n\ncalculation    of   the   amount     of    loss    and    number   of   victims\n\nattributable to him for sentencing purposes.              He claims that the\n\ndistrict court erred in basing his sentence on the total amount of\n\nloss (more than $400,000) and total number of victims (between 10\n\nand 50) attributable to the entire conspiracy, rather than on the\n\nsmaller quantities involved in the overt acts with which he was\n\ncharged or otherwise evidenced by materials provided in discovery.\n\n           The district court correctly rejected that argument and\n\nheld Morales to the Guidelines calculations that he stipulated to\n\nin his plea agreement, which were expressly based on the $400,000\n\nloss amount and the 10-to-50 victims.             As we   recently reiterated\n\nin a decision involving another co-defendant in this same case,\n\n\"[o]rdinarily, a defendant can be held to such stipulations.\"\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fUnited States v. Rodríguez-González, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201993\"><a href=\"/opinion/201993/united-states-v-rodriguez-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 167 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (citing United States v.

In this case, unlike in Rodríguez-González, there is no\n\nclaim   that    the    defendant   joined      the   conspiracy    late,   so   the\n\nprinciple      that   a   late-joining    member     of   a   conspiracy   is   not\n\nresponsible, for sentencing purposes, for conduct of his co-\n\nconspirators before he joined, id. at 168, has no bearing here.\n\nNor does the record here evidence any confusion on the judge's part\n\nas to the applicable standard.           Cf. id. at 168-69.\n\n            López argues that, in determining his criminal history\n\ncategory, the district court erred in counting one of his prior\n\nconvictions.          In reviewing this claim of Guidelines error, the\n\npre-Booker standards of review still apply; the district court's\n\ninterpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo and its\n\nrelated factual findings are reviewed for clear error.                     United\n\nStates v. Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201981\"><a href=\"/opinion/201981/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35, 38 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Specifically, López claims that his March 2003 state\n\nconviction for attempting to cash a false check should not have\n\nbeen counted in computing his criminal history score because that\n\nconviction was \"part of the instant offense,\" within the meaning of\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A.1.2.          The district court rejected that argument,\n\nreasoning that the prior conviction for check fraud was for a\n\ndifferent offense, more akin to bank fraud, than the instant\n\nconviction for credit card fraud.\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f          In so concluding, the district court does not appear to\n\nhave considered several other factors relevant to whether the prior\n\noffense was \"part of\" the instant one, including whether the\n\noffenses are \"'substantially connected to each other by at least\n\none common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices,\n\ncommon purpose, or similar modus operandi.'\"      United States v.\n\nCollazo-Aponte, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198984\"><a href=\"/opinion/198984/united-states-v-rivera-melendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 203 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 1B1.3 comment.

While \"[t]he nature of the offenses may also be a\n\nrelevant consideration,\" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3 comment. (n.9(B)), it is\n\nnot dispositive, id.    The district court cannot therefore rely on\n\nthat single factor without considering the other factors.    Because\n\ndetermining whether a prior offense is part of the instant offense\n\nis \"necessarily a fact-specific inquiry,\" id.
