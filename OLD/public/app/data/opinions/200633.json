R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 02-2676\n\n                         MANUEL PEREZ-COLON,\n\n                        Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                        ALEX CAMACHO, ET AL.,\n\n                       Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon. Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n                      Selya, Lipez and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Manuel Perez-Colon on brief pro se.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Miguel A. Fernández,\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Germán A. Rieckehoff,\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          September 5, 2003\n\f          Per Curiam. Appellant Manuel Perez-Colon appeals from the\n\njudgment of the district court dismissing his complaint which\n\nsought the return of $3,000 allegedly seized from him upon his\n\narrest.   The district court dismissed the complaint on the ground\n\nthat appellant had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as\n\nrequired by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1997e(a) (\"No action shall be brought with respect to prison\n\nconditions under . . . Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any\n\n. . . correctional facility until such administrative remedies as\n\nare available are exhausted.\").       For the following reasons, we\n\nvacate the dismissal and remand for further proceedings.\n\n          In 1998, a jury convicted appellant of various drug\n\noffenses, and, in 1999, the district court sentenced him to life\n\nimprisonment. On January 18, 2002, appellant escaped from custody.\n\nAppellant's freedom was short-lived, however, as he was arrested on\n\nFebruary 6, 2002.   At the time of his arrest, appellant alleges\n\nthat the U.S. Marshals seized the following items from him:   (1) an\n\nautomobile; (2) a watch; (3) some jewelry; and (4) $3,000 in cash.\n\n  Everything but the cash was returned to appellant's family.\n\nAppellant attached to the complaint a document entitled \"Federal\n\nPrisoner's Property Receipt.\"   This document indicates the receipt\n\nof the $3,000 and is signed by Alex Camacho, the Marshal who\n\napparently had taken the money from appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f            When appellant failed to get the cash back, he wrote a\n\nletter to the chief of the U.S. Marshals Service in Puerto Rico\n\nasking for the return of the money.         Apparently this letter was\n\nunsuccessful because appellant filed the instant complaint on\n\nSeptember 18, 2002.      In his complaint, appellant claimed that his\n\ndue process rights had been violated; in particular, he averred\n\nthat the cash had not been subject to forfeiture proceedings, but\n\nrather had just disappeared. As relief, appellant requested, among\n\nother things, an order that the U.S. Marshals return the $3,000.\n\n             Because the district court dismissed the complaint before\n\nthe defendants had responded, we must treat the dismissal as a sua\n\nsponte one.       See Gonzalez-Gonzalez v. United States, 257 F.3d 31,\n\n36 (1st Cir. 2001).      This type of dismissal -- \"a dismissal on the\n\ncourt's own initiative, without affording the plaintiff either\n\nnotice or an opportunity to be heard -- is disfavored in federal\n\npractice.\"    Id.    As a result, \"[w]e will uphold a sua sponte order\n\nof dismissal only if the allegations contained in the complaint,\n\ntaken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, are patently\n\nmeritless and beyond all hope of redemption.\"          Id. at 37.       Such\n\ndismissals are reviewed de novo.      Id.\n\n            This complaint, construed in appellant's favor as it must\n\nbe, is not \"beyond all hope of redemption.\"        That is, if it turns\n\nout that the money was seized from appellant by the U.S. Marshals\n\nas   part    of   appellant's   arrest,   and   separate   from   his    re-\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fincarceration, appellant probably is entitled to file a complaint\n\nfor the return of the money without having to exhaust any remedies.\n\n           The sticking point is that the receipt for the $3,000\n\nspecifically states that it is a \"prisoner's\" receipt.                     This\n\nreceipt suggests that the money, in fact, was confiscated from\n\nappellant at the time that he re-entered prison.               In that case, it\n\ncertainly is arguable that prison grievance procedures must be\n\nexhausted before the filing of a complaint for the return of the\n\nmoney.   See Owen v. Kimmel, 693 F.2d 711, 713-15 (7th Cir. 1982)\n\n(requiring exhaustion of a claim that prison officials confiscated\n\nthe   plaintiff's    furniture     so    long    as   the   prison's   grievance\n\nprocedures met the standards set out in former § 1997e).\n\n           In the situation where property is seized at the time of\n\nan individual's arrest, the controlling case is United States v.\n\nGiraldo, 45 F.3d 509 (1st Cir. 1995) (per curiam).               In that case,\n\nwe held that \"district courts have jurisdiction to entertain\n\ncollateral due process attacks on administrative forfeitures,\" and\n\nthat \"such challenges may be pursued in a civil action under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1331.\"      Id. at 511.    Although Giraldo was decided before\n\nthe   enactment     of   the   exhaustion       requirement   contained    in   §\n\n1997e(a), there is no indication in our case law, or in the case\n\nlaw from other circuits, that this requirement applies to actions\n\nfor the return of property seized incident to an arrest.                   See,\n\ne.g., Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 257 F.3d at 35-38 (citing Giraldo and\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fremanding a motion for the return of property seized when the\n\ndefendant was arrested where there were facts in dispute regarding\n\nthe adequacy of the notice of forfeiture provided to the defendant;\n\nno discussion of exhaustion); United States v. Minor, 228 F.3d 352,\n\n355-57 (4th Cir. 2000) (holding that a prisoner may file an action\n\nfor the return of property seized at the time he was arrested and\n\nlocating the source of such a right of action in the Constitution;\n\nno discussion of any exhaustion requirement); United States v.\n\nChambers, 192 F.3d 374, 375-77 (3d Cir. 1999) (where criminal\n\nproceedings have ended, a Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(e) motion for the\n\nreturn of property seized during the defendant's arrest is to be\n\n\"treated as a civil proceeding for equitable relief\"; no discussion\n\nof an exhaustion requirement).\n\n          Because   there   are    factual   issues   concerning   the\n\ncircumstances under which appellant's money was confiscated, the\n\ndistrict court's sua sponte dismissal cannot be upheld. Therefore,\n\nthis case must be remanded to the district court for further\n\nproceedings.   We, of course, express no views as to whether the\n\nclaim has any potential merit, or whether it might be subject to\n\ndismissal on some other ground or on a better-developed record.\n\n          Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f",
