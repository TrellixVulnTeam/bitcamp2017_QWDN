Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney\nGeneral Michael B. Mukasey as the respondent.\n\f          LYNCH, Chief Judge.          Sokun Thy Mam and his wife Sopha\n\nHeng, both natives and citizens of Cambodia, seek review of a final\n\norder of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") denying their\n\napplication for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"). The BIA affirmed the\n\ndecision of the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\"), who denied Mam and Heng's\n\napplication on the basis of an adverse credibility finding.                 We\n\ndeny the petition.\n\n                                      I.\n\n          Mam and Heng entered the United States on August 20, 2001\n\nand January 26, 2002, respectively.               Both overstayed, without\n\nauthorization.     A year after his arrival, and on the same day his\n\nauthorization    expired,     Mam    filed   an   application     for   asylum,\n\nwithholding   of   removal,    and    protection    under   the    CAT.    The\n\napplication was returned to Mam because it was prepared on an\n\noutdated form.     Mam hired an attorney, and on October 7, 2003, he\n\nfiled a proper application, listing Heng as a beneficiary.\n\n          In an affidavit submitted with the application, Mam\n\nclaimed he and his wife were persecuted by followers of Hun Sen,\n\nthe head of the Cambodian government.         The claims in the affidavit\n\nare briefly summarized.       In 1993, Mam was threatened by police and\n\nforced to support the ruling party.           In 1997, soldiers stole two\n\ntrucks and other materials from his home supply shop.              In 1998, he\n\njoined the opposition Sam Rainsy Party and received numerous death\n\n                                      -2-\n\fthreats as a result.      That same year, he was beaten while leading\n\na protest and was later arrested.              In 2000, he was elected as a\n\nboard member to a party electoral committee charged with helping to\n\nprepare for the 2002 election.           Later that year, an unidentified\n\ncar drove up to him as he was leaving the party office and pushed\n\nhis motorcycle to the curb, causing Mam to break his right kneecap\n\nand   injure    his   elbows.      In   November     2000,      Mam   fled   to   the\n\ncountryside     after   learning    that      one   of   his    friends   had     been\n\narrested.      While he was in hiding, police came repeatedly to his\n\nhouse to look for him.      Not finding him, they threatened his wife.\n\nIn February 2001, a police captain raped Heng.                    After this, she\n\nfled to the countryside to join Mam in hiding.                 Mam also claimed he\n\nhad been blacklisted after the police accused him of being involved\n\nwith the Cambodian Freedom Fighters, an anti-government group. His\n\naffidavit did not specify when this event occurred.\n\n            Mam and Heng both testified before the IJ on October 5,\n\n2006.   In an oral decision issued that day, the IJ denied Mam and\n\nHeng's application.      The denial of asylum was based on an adverse\n\ncredibility finding.      The IJ cited a series of inconsistencies in\n\nthe petitioners' testimony and affidavit. These included: (1) that\n\nMam and Heng could not agree on a date when the alleged rape of\n\nHeng occurred; (2) that Mam and Heng gave different accounts of\n\nwhen the motorcycle accident occurred and the duration of Mam's\n\nhospitalization; (3) that Mam stated in his affidavit that the\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\faccident resulted in a broken kneecap but in his testimony, Mam did\n\nnot give the particular nature of his knee injury; (4) that Mam\n\nalleged in his affidavit that he was blacklisted but then failed to\n\nmention this on direct examination and had difficulty giving a date\n\nfor when this occurred when asked on cross-examination; (5) that\n\nMam failed to mention or describe in his testimony any of the death\n\nthreats discussed in his affidavit; (6) that Mam testified he did\n\nnot have any political problems before he joined the Sam Rainsy\n\nParty in 1998 but then discussed several incidents that occurred\n\nbefore this date; and (7) that Mam was unclear in his testimony as\n\nto whether he actually won the board position in 2000.             The IJ also\n\nnoted that Heng knew almost nothing about her husband's political\n\nactivities.        The    IJ     concluded    that   these    omissions     and\n\ndiscrepancies went to the heart of the petitioners' claim, under\n\nthen-existing standards, and, in the aggregate, made it impossible\n\nfor her to credit their testimony.           The IJ also found that Mam and\n\nHeng failed to meet their burden for withholding of removal and\n\nthat they presented no evidence to support a claim for protection\n\nunder the CAT.\n\n            In an opinion issued July 15, 2008, the BIA affirmed on\n\nthe basis of the reasons stated in the IJ's opinion.           It pointed in\n\nparticular    to   a   handful    of   discrepancies   that   it   found   most\n\nstrongly supported the IJ's determination that petitioners were not\n\ncredible.     These discrepancies were: (1) whether Mam had any\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fpolitical problems before 1998; (2) whether Mam was in fact elected\n\nto a board member position in 2000; (3) the duration and date of\n\nMam's hospitalization; and (4) the date of the alleged rape.1\n\n            Mam and Heng timely filed a petition for review, which\n\nchallenges both the IJ's adverse credibility finding and the BIA's\n\naffirmance of that finding.\n\n                                         II.\n\n            \"Where, as here, 'the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's\n\nruling, but also discussed some of the bases for the IJ's opinion,\n\nwe review both the IJ's and the BIA's opinion.'\"                Cuko v. Mukasey,\n\n522 F.3d 32, 37 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Lin v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d\n\n4, 6-7 (1st Cir. 2007)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                   We\n\nreview the IJ's credibility determination under the deferential\n\nsubstantial evidence standard.           E.g., id.; Hoxha v. Gonzales, 446\n\nF.3d 210, 216 (1st Cir. 2006).           \"Since the IJ has the best vantage\n\npoint    from   which      to   assess   the   witnesses'       testimonies   and\n\ndemeanors,      we   accord     significant    respect     to    these   witness\n\ncredibility determinations.\"           Cuko, 522 F.3d at 37.       Accordingly,\n\nwe will not upset the agency's credibility determination unless\n\npetitioners can show the record evidence, considered as a whole,\n\n\"would    compel     a    reasonable     factfinder   to    make    a    contrary\n\ndetermination.\"          Id. (emphasis in original) (quoting Stroni v.\n\n\n     1\n          The BIA also rejected as meritless a challenge to the\nIJ's decision based on due process grounds. Petitioners have not\nchallenged this ruling in their petition for review.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fGonzales, 454 F.3d 82, 87 (1st Cir. 2006)) (internal quotation mark\n\nomitted); accord Lutaaya v. Mukasey, 535 F.3d 63, 70 (1st Cir.\n\n2008); Segran v. Mukasey, 511 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2007); see also\n\nHem v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 67, 69 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           In reviewing an adverse credibility determination, we\n\nlook specifically to whether: (1) \"the discrepancies articulated by\n\nthe IJ and/or the BIA are actually present in the administrative\n\nrecord\";   (2)    \"the   discrepancies   generate   specific   and    cogent\n\nreasons from which to infer that petitioner or his witness provided\n\nnon-creditworthy testimony\"; and (3) \"petitioner failed to provide\n\na persuasive explanation for these discrepancies.\"        Cuko, 522 F.3d\n\nat 37; accord Zeru v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 59, 69-70 (1st Cir. 2007);\n\nHoxha, 446 F.3d at 216-17.\n\n           The IJ cited a number of discrepancies and omissions that\n\nstrongly support her finding that Mam and Heng were not credible.\n\nFirst, the IJ stated that Mam and Heng were inconsistent in their\n\ntestimony about when the alleged rape had occurred.                  The BIA\n\nopinion    also    highlighted   this    as   a   particularly   critical\n\ndiscrepancy.      This discrepancy is clearly present in the record.\n\nOn direct examination, Heng testified that the rape occurred\n\n\"sometime in 2001.\"       When asked to give a more specific date on\n\ncross-examination, she responded, \"sometime in either September or\n\nOctober,\" and then immediately added, \"November 23, 2001?\"               The\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fgovernment's lawyer then asked, \"November 23, 2001 is when the\n\nincident happened, ma'am?\"          She responded: \"Maybe.\"\n\n           Heng's testimony is contradicted by Mam's statement in\n\nhis affidavit that the alleged rape occurred in February 2001. The\n\nIJ's opinion mistakenly states that Heng gave the date as November\n\n23, 2000, which is about two months off of the date given in Mam's\n\naffidavit.     The actual date given by Heng in her testimony,\n\nNovember 23, 2001, is in fact further removed from the date given\n\nby Mam.    Thus, the actual discrepancy between Mam's and Heng's\n\naccounts is even greater than that cited by the IJ.                     Moreover, it\n\nis notable that the date Heng eventually, if tentatively, settled\n\non when pressed to give a specific date is similar to a date listed\n\non the affidavit for another event: November 23, 2000 is the date\n\nlisted in the affidavit for when Mam fled to the countryside alone.\n\n           This     discrepancy     goes        to   the   heart   of   petitioners'\n\nclaim.2   The horrific assertion that Heng was raped by a police\n\nofficer   as   a    result   of    her    husband's        political    activity   is\n\npetitioners'       strongest      claim    for       asylum   on    the   basis    of\n\n\n\n     2\n          The REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat.\n231, \"abolishes the 'heart of the claim' rule.\" Cuko, 522 F.3d at\n38 n.2; accord Lutaaya, 535 F.3d at 70 n.8; see also Hoxha, 446\nF.3d at 216 n.4 (stating that the Act \"alters, among other things,\nthe standards governing credibility determinations and the need for\ncorroboration of testimony in asylum cases\" (quoting Dhima v.\nGonzales, 416 F.3d 92, 95 n.3 (2005)) (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). However, because petitioners' application pre-dates the\neffective date of the Act, this change is inapplicable here. See\nCuko, 522 F.3d at 38 n.2; Lutaaya, 535 F.3d at 70 n.8.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fpersecution.    That Mam and Heng could not agree on a date, and\n\nindeed gave a series of dates spread over a year for when this\n\nalleged traumatic event occurred is a specific, cogent reason for\n\ninferring a lack of credibility.      See Hoxha, 446 F.3d at 217.\n\n            In attempting to explain the discrepancy, petitioners\n\nargue that expecting that the two of them \"would have had a calm\n\ndetailed discussion\" about Heng's rape \"make[s] no sense.\"              Not\n\ntrue.    Before they testified, years later, they could be expected\n\nto get their stories straight.           Moreover, whether or not that\n\nassertion is credited, the IJ's conclusion rested on no such\n\nexpectation.   Nothing compels the conclusion they did not discuss\n\nthe alleged rape.   Indeed, Heng and Mam had enough of a discussion\n\nabout the rape to allow Mam to describe it in some detail in his\n\naffidavit.     Moreover,    Heng   testified   that   she   fled   to   the\n\ncountryside to join Mam after the rape occurred, so it is not\n\nunreasonable to assume that she would have described to him the\n\ncircumstances surrounding her flight or that he would know when it\n\nwas that she joined him.3\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          The argument that Heng's confusion about the date may\nhave stemmed from the emotional strain that must be inherent in\nattempting to recount the details behind her rape was raised by Mam\nand Heng's counsel in their appeal before the BIA but was not\nraised here. Even given this argument, a reasonable factfinder\nwould not be compelled to reach a conclusion contrary to the IJ's,\nespecially given that the IJ observed the demeanor of the witness\nthroughout. See Cuko, 522 F.3d at 38 n.3 (\"Even equally competing\ninferences do not allow us to unsettle the IJ's determination.\").\n\n                                   -8-\n\f           The second material discrepancy found by the IJ, and\n\nhighlighted by the BIA, concerns the date and length of Mam's\n\nhospitalization after the incident with the motorcycle, which Mam\n\nattributes   to    retaliation     for    his     party    membership.     This\n\ndiscrepancy is present in the record.                In Mam's affidavit and\n\ntestimony, he stated that the incident in which an unidentified car\n\nchased him and knocked him to the ground as he drove out from the\n\nparty office occurred in June 2000, and that he was hospitalized as\n\na result for two weeks.        Heng, however, gave a different account.\n\nOn cross-examination, Heng stated and then reaffirmed that her\n\nhusband was hospitalized for only two days.                She also could not\n\nidentify the year in which this incident occurred.              When asked to\n\ngive a date, she responded: \"1996, 1998. . . . 1996, 1993.                 Like\n\nthat.    1996, 1993.       Something.    I'm not quite sure.\"        As the IJ\n\nnoted,   there    is   a   significant        difference   between   a   two-day\n\nhospitalization and a two-week hospitalization, and the fact that\n\nMam and Heng gave different accounts as to what occurred and the\n\nyear in which this occurred goes to the heart of their claims.\n\nPetitioners made no attempt to explain this discrepancy, either\n\nbefore the agency or in their petition for review.\n\n           The IJ's conclusion is also supported by the fact that\n\nMam and Heng did not provide any corroborating evidence regarding\n\nthe accident, such as hospital reports, or any indication that they\n\nattempted to procure such evidence. See Muñoz-Monsalve v. Mukasey,\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f551 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"[T]he IJ is warranted in weighing\n\nin the balance the existence and availability of corroborating\n\nevidence, and the effect of its non-production.\").\n\n            A third material inconsistency found by the IJ related to\n\nMam's purportedly being blacklisted in Cambodia as a result of his\n\npolitical   activities.    In   his   affidavit,   Mam   claimed   he   was\n\nblacklisted because the police accused him of \"being involved in\n\nthe Cambodian Freedom Fighters\"; the affidavit does not provide a\n\ndate for when this occurred.     In his affidavit, Mam also claimed\n\nthat being blacklisted was one of the things that caused him to\n\n\"[feel] like [he] could no longer live in Cambodia.\"       In his direct\n\ntestimony, however, Mam never mentioned being blacklisted, and when\n\nasked about it on cross-examination, he provided no further details\n\nand said he could not remember in what year this occurred -- only\n\nthat it \"maybe\" happened around the time of the elections in 1998.\n\nAdditionally, Mam said nothing about the Cambodian Freedom Fighters\n\naccusation that he claimed caused him to be blacklisted; instead,\n\nhe said only that \"when I stood up and opposed their party, they\n\nlisted me on the blacklist.\"      Since Mam stated in his affidavit\n\nthat being blacklisted was one of the things that forced him to\n\nleave Cambodia, this discrepancy is central to his claim.          Again,\n\npetitioners made no effort to provide an alternative explanation.\n\n            A fourth material inconsistency discussed by the IJ is\n\nthat, in his affidavit, Mam claimed that as a result of joining the\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fSam Rainsy Party, he \"received many death threats [on] several\n\noccasions,\" but that Mam omitted any mention of these death threats\n\nfrom his direct testimony.          When asked about this omission on\n\ncross-examination, he said only that he \"continuously receive[d]\n\ndeath   threat[s]\"   and    did   not   attempt    to   provide   any    further\n\nelaboration or explanation.             Mam's failure to recount in his\n\ntestimony every detail listed in his affidavit, of course, would\n\nnot be fatal to his claim in and of itself.             See Heng v. Gonzales,\n\n493 F.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 2007).         But if Mam was actually receiving\n\ndeath threats \"continuously,\" as he claimed, this is hardly a minor\n\ndetail, and, taken together with the other discrepancies and\n\nomissions in the record, the omission supports the IJ's adverse\n\ncredibility determination.        See id.; Pan v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d 80,\n\n86 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"Some of these inconsistencies, in isolation,\n\nmay seem like small potatoes.       What counts, however, is that their\n\ncumulative effect is great.\").\n\n            Some of the other inconsistencies found by the IJ are not\n\nas   strongly   supported    in   the    record.     However,     this   is   not\n\nsufficient to unsettle the agency's determination. Even if we were\n\nto discount entirely the IJ's findings as to any inconsistencies\n\nregarding   Mam's    involvement    with    the    election   committee,      his\n\ndescription of his problems before 1998, and the nature of his knee\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\finjury,4 the other, significant discrepancies discussed by the IJ\n\nand the BIA are more than sufficient to support the adverse\n\ncredibility finding.               Reviewing the record as a whole, we cannot\n\nconclude that the IJ was compelled to find petitioners credible.\n\nSee Segran, 511 F.3d at 6; see also Hoxha v. Mukasey, 256 F. App'x\n\n368, 372-73 (1st Cir. 2007); Jiang v. Gonzáles, 156 F. App'x 336,\n\n340-41 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                 Because     Mam     and   Heng    failed   to   provide    credible\n\ntestimony, they could not meet the burden of proof required to\n\nestablish their asylum claims.               See Hem, 514 F.3d at 73; Melhem v.\n\nGonzales, 500 F.3d 78, 81 (1st Cir. 2007); Dine v. Gonzales, 464\n\nF.3d       89,   93   (1st    Cir.    2006).       This   also   means   petitioners\n\nnecessarily could not meet the more stringent burden required for\n\nwithholding of removal.              Sok v. Mukasey, 541 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir.\n\n2008); Dine, 464 F.3d at 93.                      Petitioners made no arguments\n\nchallenging the agency's denial of their claims under the CAT,\n\neither before the BIA or in their petition for review.\n\n                 The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          Petitioners devote much of their brief to arguing that\nthe IJ claimed Mam \"never mention[ed]\" his injured knee when in\nfact he did so a number of times during his testimony, and that\nthis demonstrated that the IJ had \"a prejudicial faulty memory.\"\nThis is incorrect.

Latour, Assistant Director, on brief for respondent.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, SELYA and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>Sokun Thy Mam and his wife Sopha Heng, both natives and citizens of Cambodia, seek review of a final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") denying their application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"). The BIA affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\"), who denied Mam and Heng's application on the basis of an adverse credibility finding. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Mam and Heng entered the United States on August 20, 2001 and January 26, 2002, respectively. Both overstayed, without authorization. A year after his arrival, and on the same day his authorization expired, Mam filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. The application was returned to Mam because it was prepared on an outdated form. Mam hired an attorney, and on October 7, 2003, he filed a proper application, listing Heng as a beneficiary.</p>\n<p>In an affidavit submitted with the application, Mam claimed he and his wife were persecuted by followers of Hun Sen, the head of the Cambodian government. The claims in the affidavit are briefly summarized. In 1993, Mam was threatened by police and forced to support the ruling party. In 1997, soldiers stole two trucks and other materials from his home supply shop. In 1998, he joined the opposition Sam Rainsy Party and received numerous death threats as a result. That same year, he was beaten while leading a protest and was later arrested. In 2000, he was elected as a board member to a party electoral committee charged with helping to prepare for the 2002 election. Later that year, an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*282</span> unidentified car drove up to him as he was leaving the party office and pushed his motorcycle to the curb, causing Mam to break his right kneecap and injure his elbows. In November 2000, Mam fled to the countryside after learning that one of his friends had been arrested. While he was in hiding, police came repeatedly to his house to look for him. Not finding him, they threatened his wife. In February 2001, a police captain raped Heng. After this, she fled to the countryside to join Mam in hiding. Mam also claimed he had been blacklisted after the police accused him of being involved with the Cambodian Freedom Fighters, an anti-government group. His affidavit did not specify when this event occurred.</p>\n<p>Mam and Heng both testified before the IJ on October 5, 2006. In an oral decision issued that day, the IJ denied Mam and Heng's application. The denial of asylum was based on an adverse credibility finding. The IJ cited a series of inconsistencies in the petitioners' testimony and affidavit. These included: (1) that Mam and Heng could not agree on a date when the alleged rape of Heng occurred; (2) that Mam and Heng gave different accounts of when the motorcycle accident occurred and the duration of Mam's hospitalization; (3) that Mam stated in his affidavit that the accident resulted in a broken kneecap but in his testimony, Mam did not give the particular nature of his knee injury; (4) that Mam alleged in his affidavit that he was blacklisted but then failed to mention this on direct examination and had difficulty giving a date for when this occurred when asked on cross-examination; (5) that Mam failed to mention or describe in his testimony any of the death threats discussed in his affidavit; (6) that Mam testified he did not have any political problems before he joined the Sam Rainsy Party in 1998 but then discussed several incidents that occurred before this date; and (7) that Mam was unclear in his testimony as to whether he actually won the board position in 2000. The IJ also noted that Heng knew almost nothing about her husband's political activities. The IJ concluded that these omissions and discrepancies went to the heart of the petitioners' claim, under then-existing standards, and, in the aggregate, made it impossible for her to credit their testimony. The IJ also found that Mam and Heng failed to meet their burden for withholding of removal and that they presented no evidence to support a claim for protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p>In an opinion issued July 15, 2008, the BIA affirmed on the basis of the reasons stated in the IJ's opinion. It pointed in particular to a handful of discrepancies that it found most strongly supported the IJ's determination that petitioners were not credible. These discrepancies were: (1) whether Mam had any political problems before 1998; (2) whether Mam was in fact elected to a board member position in 2000; (3) the duration and date of Mam's hospitalization; and (4) the date of the alleged rape.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Mam and Heng timely filed a petition for review, which challenges both the IJ's adverse credibility finding and the BIA's affirmance of that finding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>\"Where, as here, `the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's ruling, but also discussed some of the bases for the IJ's opinion, we review both the IJ's and the BIA's opinion.'\" <i>Cuko v. Mukasey,</i> 522 F.3d 32, 37 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Lin v. Gonzales,</i> 503 F.3d 4, 6-7 (1st Cir. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*283</span> 2007)) (internal quotation marks omitted). We review the IJ's credibility determination under the deferential substantial evidence standard. <i>E.g., id.; </i><i>Hoxha v. Gonzales,</i> 446 F.3d 210, 216 (1st Cir.2006). \"Since the IJ has the best vantage point from which to assess the witnesses' testimonies and demeanors, we accord significant respect to these witness credibility determinations.\" <i>Cuko,</i> 522 F.3d at 37. Accordingly, we will not upset the agency's credibility determination unless petitioners can show the record evidence, considered as a whole, \"would <i>compel</i> a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original) (quoting <i>Stroni v. Gonzales,</i> 454 F.3d 82, 87 (1st Cir.2006)) (internal quotation mark omitted); <i>accord </i><i>Lutaaya v. Mukasey,</i> 535 F.3d 63, 70 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Segran v. Mukasey,</i> 511 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2007); <i>see also </i><i>Hem v. Mukasey,</i> 514 F.3d 67, 69 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>In reviewing an adverse credibility determination, we look specifically to whether: (1) \"the discrepancies articulated by the IJ and/or the BIA are actually present in the administrative record\"; (2) \"the discrepancies generate specific and cogent reasons from which to infer that petitioner or his witness provided non-creditworthy testimony\"; and (3) \"petitioner failed to provide a persuasive explanation for these discrepancies.\" <i>Cuko,</i> 522 F.3d at 37; <i>accord </i><i>Zeru v. Gonzales,</i> 503 F.3d 59, 69-70 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Hoxha,</i> 446 F.3d at 216-17.</p>\n<p>The IJ cited a number of discrepancies and omissions that strongly support her finding that Mam and Heng were not credible. First, the IJ stated that Mam and Heng were inconsistent in their testimony about when the alleged rape had occurred. The BIA opinion also highlighted this as a particularly critical discrepancy. This discrepancy is clearly present in the record. On direct examination, Heng testified that the rape occurred \"sometime in 2001.\" When asked to give a more specific date on cross-examination, she responded, \"sometime in either September or October,\" and then immediately added, \"November 23, 2001?\" The government's lawyer then asked, \"November 23, 2001 is when the incident happened, ma'am?\" She responded: \"Maybe.\"</p>\n<p>Heng's testimony is contradicted by Mam's statement in his affidavit that the alleged rape occurred in February 2001. The IJ's opinion mistakenly states that Heng gave the date as November 23, 2000, which is about two months off of the date given in Mam's affidavit. The actual date given by Heng in her testimony, November 23, 2001, is in fact further removed from the date given by Mam. Thus, the actual discrepancy between Mam's and Heng's accounts is even greater than that cited by the IJ. Moreover, it is notable that the date Heng eventually, if tentatively, settled on when pressed to give a specific date is similar to a date listed on the affidavit for another event: November 23, 2000 is the date listed in the affidavit for when Mam fled to the countryside alone.</p>\n<p>This discrepancy goes to the heart of petitioners' claim.<sup>[2]</sup> The horrific assertion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*284</span> that Heng was raped by a police officer as a result of her husband's political activity is petitioners' strongest claim for asylum on the basis of persecution. That Mam and Heng could not agree on a date, and indeed gave a series of dates spread over a year for when this alleged traumatic event occurred is a specific, cogent reason for inferring a lack of credibility. <i>See </i><i>Hoxha,</i> 446 F.3d at 217.</p>\n<p>In attempting to explain the discrepancy, petitioners argue that expecting that the two of them \"would have had a calm detailed discussion\" about Heng's rape \"make[s] no sense.\" Not true. Before they testified, years later, they could be expected to get their stories straight. Moreover, whether or not that assertion is credited, the IJ's conclusion rested on no such expectation. Nothing compels the conclusion they did not discuss the alleged rape. Indeed, Heng and Mam had enough of a discussion about the rape to allow Mam to describe it in some detail in his affidavit. Moreover, Heng testified that she fled to the countryside to join Mam after the rape occurred, so it is not unreasonable to assume that she would have described to him the circumstances surrounding her flight or that he would know when it was that she joined him.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The second material discrepancy found by the IJ, and highlighted by the BIA, concerns the date and length of Mam's hospitalization after the incident with the motorcycle, which Mam attributes to retaliation for his party membership. This discrepancy is present in the record. In Mam's affidavit and testimony, he stated that the incident in which an unidentified car chased him and knocked him to the ground as he drove out from the party office occurred in June 2000, and that he was hospitalized as a result for two <i>weeks.</i> Heng, however, gave a different account. On cross-examination, Heng stated and then reaffirmed that her husband was hospitalized for only two <i>days.</i> She also could not identify the year in which this incident occurred. When asked to give a date, she responded: \"1996, 1998.... 1996, 1993. Like that.1996, 1993. Something. I'm not quite sure.\" As the IJ noted, there is a significant difference between a two-day hospitalization and a two-week hospitalization, and the fact that Mam and Heng gave different accounts as to what occurred and the year in which this occurred goes to the heart of their claims. Petitioners made no attempt to explain this discrepancy, either before the agency or in their petition for review.</p>\n<p>The IJ's conclusion is also supported by the fact that Mam and Heng did not provide any corroborating evidence regarding the accident, such as hospital reports, or any indication that they attempted to procure such evidence. <i>See </i><i>Muñoz-Monsalve v. Mukasey,</i> 551 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2008) (\"[T]he IJ is warranted in weighing in the balance the existence and availability of corroborating evidence, and the effect of its non-production.\").</p>\n<p>A third material inconsistency found by the IJ related to Mam's purportedly being blacklisted in Cambodia as a result of his political activities. In his affidavit, Mam claimed he was blacklisted because the police accused him of \"being involved in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*285</span> the Cambodian Freedom Fighters\"; the affidavit does not provide a date for when this occurred. In his affidavit, Mam also claimed that being blacklisted was one of the things that caused him to \"[feel] like [he] could no longer live in Cambodia.\" In his direct testimony, however, Mam never mentioned being blacklisted, and when asked about it on cross-examination, he provided no further details and said he could not remember in what year this occurred-only that it \"maybe\" happened around the time of the elections in 1998. Additionally, Mam said nothing about the Cambodian Freedom Fighters accusation that he claimed caused him to be blacklisted; instead, he said only that \"when I stood up and opposed their party, they listed me on the blacklist.\" Since Mam stated in his affidavit that being blacklisted was one of the things that forced him to leave Cambodia, this discrepancy is central to his claim. Again, petitioners made no effort to provide an alternative explanation.</p>\n<p>A fourth material inconsistency discussed by the IJ is that, in his affidavit, Mam claimed that as a result of joining the Sam Rainsy Party, he \"received many death threats [on] several occasions,\" but that Mam omitted any mention of these death threats from his direct testimony. When asked about this omission on cross-examination, he said only that he \"continuously receive[d] death threat[s]\" and did not attempt to provide any further elaboration or explanation. Mam's failure to recount in his testimony every detail listed in his affidavit, of course, would not be fatal to his claim in and of itself. <i>See </i><i>Heng v. Gonzales,</i> 493 F.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir.2007). But if Mam was actually receiving death threats \"continuously,\" as he claimed, this is hardly a minor detail, and, taken together with the other discrepancies and omissions in the record, the omission supports the IJ's adverse credibility determination. <i>See id.; </i><i>Pan v. Gonzales,</i> 489 F.3d 80, 86 (1st Cir.2007) (\"Some of these inconsistencies, in isolation, may seem like small potatoes. What counts, however, is that their cumulative effect is great.\").</p>\n<p>Some of the other inconsistencies found by the IJ are not as strongly supported in the record. However, this is not sufficient to unsettle the agency's determination. Even if we were to discount entirely the IJ's findings as to any inconsistencies regarding Mam's involvement with the election committee, his description of his problems before 1998, and the nature of his knee injury,<sup>[4]</sup> the other, significant discrepancies discussed by the IJ and the BIA are more than sufficient to support the adverse credibility finding. Reviewing the record as a whole, we cannot conclude that the IJ was compelled to find petitioners credible. <i>See </i><i>Segran,</i> 511 F.3d at 6; <i>see also Hoxha v. Mukasey,</i> 256 Fed.Appx. 368, 372-73 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Jiang v. Gonzáles,</i> 156 Fed.Appx. 336, 340-41 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p>Because Mam and Heng failed to provide credible testimony, they could not meet the burden of proof required to establish their asylum claims. <i>See </i><i>Hem,</i> 514 F.3d at 73; <i>Melhem v. Gonzales,</i> 500 F.3d 78, 81 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Dine v. Gonzales,</i> 464 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir.2006). This also means petitioners necessarily could not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*286</span> meet the more stringent burden required for withholding of removal. <i>Sok v. Mukasey,</i> 541 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Dine,</i> 464 F.3d at 93. Petitioners made no arguments challenging the agency's denial of their claims under the CAT, either before the BIA or in their petition for review.</p>\n<p>The petition for review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey as the respondent.</p>\n<p>[1]  The BIA also rejected as meritless a challenge to the IJ's decision based on due process grounds. Petitioners have not challenged this ruling in their petition for review.</p>\n<p>[2]  The REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, \"abolishes the `heart of the claim' rule.\" <i>Cuko,</i> 522 F.3d at 38 n. 2; <i>accord </i><i>Lutaaya,</i> 535 F.3d at 70 n. 8; <i>see also </i><i>Hoxha,</i> 446 F.3d at 216 n. 4 (stating that the Act \"alters, among other things, the standards governing credibility determinations and the need for corroboration of testimony in asylum cases\" (quoting <i>Dhima v. Gonzales,</i> 416 F.3d 92, 95 n. 3 (2005)) (internal quotation marks omitted)). However, because petitioners' application pre-dates the effective date of the Act, this change is inapplicable here. <i>See </i><i>Cuko,</i> 522 F.3d at 38 n. 2; <i>Lutaaya,</i> 535 F.3d at 70 n. 8.</p>\n<p>[3]  The argument that Heng's confusion about the date may have stemmed from the emotional strain that must be inherent in attempting to recount the details behind her rape was raised by Mam and Heng's counsel in their appeal before the BIA but was not raised here. Even given this argument, a reasonable factfinder would not be compelled to reach a conclusion contrary to the IJ's, especially given that the IJ observed the demeanor of the witness throughout. <i>See </i><i>Cuko,</i> 522 F.3d at 38 n. 3 (\"Even equally competing inferences do not allow us to unsettle the IJ's determination.\").</p>\n<p>[4]  Petitioners devote much of their brief to arguing that the IJ claimed Mam \"never mention[ed]\" his injured knee when in fact he did so a number of times during his testimony, and that this demonstrated that the IJ had \"a prejudicial faulty memory.\" This is incorrect. The IJ never asserted that Mam failed to mention his injured knee; rather, she acknowledged that Mam said he had an injured knee but emphasized that he had failed to specify the <i>type</i> of injury this was.</p>\n\n</div>",

Moreover, it is notable that the date Heng eventually, if tentatively, settled on when pressed to give a specific date is similar to a date listed on the affidavit for another event: November 23, 2000 is the date listed in the affidavit for when Mam fled to the countryside alone.</p>\n<p>This discrepancy goes to the heart of petitioners' claim.<sup>[2]</sup> The horrific assertion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*284</span> that Heng was raped by a police officer as a result of her husband's political activity is petitioners' strongest claim for asylum on the basis of persecution. That Mam and Heng could not agree on a date, and indeed gave a series of dates spread over a year for when this alleged traumatic event occurred is a specific, cogent reason for inferring a lack of credibility. <i>See </i><i>Hoxha,</i> 446 F.3d at 217.</p>\n<p>In attempting to explain the discrepancy, petitioners argue that expecting that the two of them \"would have had a calm detailed discussion\" about Heng's rape \"make[s] no sense.\" Not true. Before they testified, years later, they could be expected to get their stories straight. Moreover, whether or not that assertion is credited, the IJ's conclusion rested on no such expectation. Nothing compels the conclusion they did not discuss the alleged rape. Indeed, Heng and Mam had enough of a discussion about the rape to allow Mam to describe it in some detail in his affidavit. Moreover, Heng testified that she fled to the countryside to join Mam after the rape occurred, so it is not unreasonable to assume that she would have described to him the circumstances surrounding her flight or that he would know when it was that she joined him.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The second material discrepancy found by the IJ, and highlighted by the BIA, concerns the date and length of Mam's hospitalization after the incident with the motorcycle, which Mam attributes to retaliation for his party membership. This discrepancy is present in the record. In Mam's affidavit and testimony, he stated that the incident in which an unidentified car chased him and knocked him to the ground as he drove out from the party office occurred in June 2000, and that he was hospitalized as a result for two <i>weeks.</i> Heng, however, gave a different account. On cross-examination, Heng stated and then reaffirmed that her husband was hospitalized for only two <i>days.</i> She also could not identify the year in which this incident occurred. When asked to give a date, she responded: \"1996, 1998.... 1996, 1993. Like that.1996, 1993. Something. I'm not quite sure.\" As the IJ noted, there is a significant difference between a two-day hospitalization and a two-week hospitalization, and the fact that Mam and Heng gave different accounts as to what occurred and the year in which this occurred goes to the heart of their claims. Petitioners made no attempt to explain this discrepancy, either before the agency or in their petition for review.</p>\n<p>The IJ's conclusion is also supported by the fact that Mam and Heng did not provide any corroborating evidence regarding the accident, such as hospital reports, or any indication that they attempted to procure such evidence. <i>See </i><i>Muñoz-Monsalve v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203588\"><a href=\"/opinion/203588/mun-oz-monsalve-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.2008) (\"[T]he IJ is warranted in weighing in the balance the existence and availability of corroborating evidence, and the effect of its non-production.\").</p>\n<p>A third material inconsistency found by the IJ related to Mam's purportedly being blacklisted in Cambodia as a result of his political activities. In his affidavit, Mam claimed he was blacklisted because the police accused him of \"being involved in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*285</span> the Cambodian Freedom Fighters\"; the affidavit does not provide a date for when this occurred. In his affidavit, Mam also claimed that being blacklisted was one of the things that caused him to \"[feel] like [he] could no longer live in Cambodia.\" In his direct testimony, however, Mam never mentioned being blacklisted, and when asked about it on cross-examination, he provided no further details and said he could not remember in what year this occurred-only that it \"maybe\" happened around the time of the elections in 1998. Additionally, Mam said nothing about the Cambodian Freedom Fighters accusation that he claimed caused him to be blacklisted; instead, he said only that \"when I stood up and opposed their party, they listed me on the blacklist.\" Since Mam stated in his affidavit that being blacklisted was one of the things that forced him to leave Cambodia, this discrepancy is central to his claim. Again, petitioners made no effort to provide an alternative explanation.</p>\n<p>A fourth material inconsistency discussed by the IJ is that, in his affidavit, Mam claimed that as a result of joining the Sam Rainsy Party, he \"received many death threats [on] several occasions,\" but that Mam omitted any mention of these death threats from his direct testimony. When asked about this omission on cross-examination, he said only that he \"continuously receive[d] death threat[s]\" and did not attempt to provide any further elaboration or explanation. Mam's failure to recount in his testimony every detail listed in his affidavit, of course, would not be fatal to his claim in and of itself. <i>See </i><i>Heng v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202837\"><a href=\"/opinion/202837/heng-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.2007). But if Mam was actually receiving death threats \"continuously,\" as he claimed, this is hardly a minor detail, and, taken together with the other discrepancies and omissions in the record, the omission supports the IJ's adverse credibility determination. <i>See id.; </i><i>Pan v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202784\"><a href=\"/opinion/202784/pan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 86 (1st Cir.2007) (\"Some of these inconsistencies, in isolation, may seem like small potatoes. What counts, however, is that their cumulative effect is great.\").</p>\n<p>Some of the other inconsistencies found by the IJ are not as strongly supported in the record. However, this is not sufficient to unsettle the agency's determination. Even if we were to discount entirely the IJ's findings as to any inconsistencies regarding Mam's involvement with the election committee, his description of his problems before 1998, and the nature of his knee injury,<sup>[4]</sup> the other, significant discrepancies discussed by the IJ and the BIA are more than sufficient to support the adverse credibility finding. Reviewing the record as a whole, we cannot conclude that the IJ was compelled to find petitioners credible. <i>See </i><i>Segran,</i> 511 F.3d at 6; <i>see also Hoxha v. Mukasey,</i> 256 Fed.Appx. 368, 372-73 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Jiang v. Gonzáles,</i> 156 Fed.Appx. 336, 340-41 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p>Because Mam and Heng failed to provide credible testimony, they could not meet the burden of proof required to establish their asylum claims. <i>See </i><i>Hem,</i> 514 F.3d at 73; <i>Melhem v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202909\"><a href=\"/opinion/202909/melhem-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 81 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Dine v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202438\"><a href=\"/opinion/202438/dine-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 93 (1st Cir.2006). This also means petitioners necessarily could not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*286</span> meet the more stringent burden required for withholding of removal. <i>Sok v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203476\"><a href=\"/opinion/203476/sok-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Dine,</i> 464 F.3d at 93. Petitioners made no arguments challenging the agency's denial of their claims under the CAT, either before the BIA or in their petition for review.</p>\n<p>The petition for review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey as the respondent.</p>\n<p>[1]  The BIA also rejected as meritless a challenge to the IJ's decision based on due process grounds. Petitioners have not challenged this ruling in their petition for review.</p>\n<p>[2]  The REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, \"abolishes the `heart of the claim' rule.\" <i>Cuko,</i> 522 F.3d at 38 n. 2; <i>accord </i><i>Lutaaya,</i> 535 F.3d at 70 n. 8; <i>see also </i><i>Hoxha,</i> 446 F.3d at 216 n. 4 (stating that the Act \"alters, among other things, the standards governing credibility determinations and the need for corroboration of testimony in asylum cases\" (quoting <i>Dhima v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201733\"><a href=\"/opinion/201733/dhima-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 95 n. 3 (2005)) (internal quotation marks omitted)). However, because petitioners' application pre-dates the effective date of the Act, this change is inapplicable here. <i>See </i><i>Cuko,</i> 522 F.3d at 38 n. 2; <i>Lutaaya,</i> 535 F.3d at 70 n. 8.</p>\n<p>[3]  The argument that Heng's confusion about the date may have stemmed from the emotional strain that must be inherent in attempting to recount the details behind her rape was raised by Mam and Heng's counsel in their appeal before the BIA but was not raised here. Even given this argument, a reasonable factfinder would not be compelled to reach a conclusion contrary to the IJ's, especially given that the IJ observed the demeanor of the witness throughout. <i>See </i><i>Cuko,</i> 522 F.3d at 38 n. 3 (\"Even equally competing inferences do not allow us to unsettle the IJ's determination.\").</p>\n<p>[4]  Petitioners devote much of their brief to arguing that the IJ claimed Mam \"never mention[ed]\" his injured knee when in fact he did so a number of times during his testimony, and that this demonstrated that the IJ had \"a prejudicial faulty memory.\" This is incorrect. The IJ never asserted that Mam failed to mention his injured knee; rather, she acknowledged that Mam said he had an injured knee but emphasized that he had failed to specify the <i>type</i> of injury this was.</p>\n\n</div>",
