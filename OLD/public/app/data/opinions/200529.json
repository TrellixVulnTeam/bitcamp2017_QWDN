Torres, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney, Chief, Criminal Division, were on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                        September 8, 2003\n\f             TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.             Co-defendants and appellants\n\nRamón   Figueroa      Encarnación         (\"Figueroa\")       and    Alberto     Medina\n\n(\"Medina\") were charged in a two count indictment with (1) aiding\n\nand abetting each other in the knowing, intentional and willful\n\npossession with intent to distribute of fifty grams of cocaine base\n\n(crack cocaine) in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841 and 18 U.S.C. § 2\n\n(\"drug count\"); and (2) aiding and abetting each other in the\n\nknowing possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug\n\ntrafficking crime, in contravention of 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3) (\"gun\n\ncount\").     Figueroa was convicted of the gun count and acquitted of\n\nthe   drug   count;    Medina       was   convicted    of    the    drug     count   and\n\nacquitted of the gun count.               Both now appeal, presenting various\n\nclaims of     error.        After    careful      review,    we    affirm    Figueroa-\n\nEncarnación's       conviction      in    its    entirety;   we    affirm     Medina's\n\nconviction     in    part    and    reverse      and   remand      it   in   part    for\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                   I.     Background\n\n             On February 4, 1999, the Arrest and Search Warrant\n\nDivision1 (\"the Division\") of the Puerto Rico Police Department\n\n(\"PRPD\") began a new program to investigate drug trafficking in the\n\n\n\n1\n   The purpose of the Division was to 1) investigate various drug\ntrafficking locations, also known as \"drug points\"; 2) determine\nthe location of the drugs and weapons at these drug points; and 3)\nobtain search warrants from local judges in order to seize the\ndrugs and weapons and to arrest the individuals involved in drug\ntrafficking.\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJardines de Campo Rico Housing Project in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico\n\n(\"Campo Rico Project\").        At the time, the Campo Rico Project\n\ncontained various known or suspected drug dealing points, including\n\none at the boundary with a privately owned complex, the Jardines de\n\nBerwind Condominium (\"Berwind Condominium\").\n\n          On February 4, 1999, three plain-clothed agents, Hiram\n\nCruz Alvarez (\"Agent Cruz\"), Angel Vargas Cruz (\"Agent Vargas\") and\n\nJose Umpierre (\"Agent Umpierre\"), were assigned to conduct the\n\nsurveillance of the drug dealing points at the Campo Rico Project.\n\nPart of the plan for surveillance involved securing an upper-floor\n\napartment in Berwind Condominiums as a vantage point.\n\n          According    to    the   government's   evidence,   Agent   Cruz\n\nobserved Figueroa and Medina standing together at a known drug\n\ndealing point, the fence next to the Campo Rico Project.              When\n\nsomeone in the project yelled \"agua\" -- a code word for police\n\npresence in the area -- Medina and Figueroa turned simultaneously\n\nand headed towards the stairs of the Berwind Condominium.             Agent\n\nCruz identified himself as a police officer, and then Medina and\n\nFigueroa split up and ran in different directions.            Agent Cruz\n\narrested Medina, who had in his possession a number of vials of\n\ncrack cocaine.   In addition, Medina possessed $108 in bills of\n\nsmall denominations.        Agent Vargas arrested Figueroa, who was\n\ncarrying a loaded .38 caliber revolver.            A third person was\n\narrested by agent Umpierre but was later released.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f          The   defense   argued,    unsuccessfully,    that    Medina    and\n\nFigueroa were attacked by several plain-clothed officers. Further,\n\nthe defense claimed that the officers planted both the drug vials\n\nand the gun.\n\n          After a twelve day trial, Figueroa was found guilty of\n\nthe gun count and acquitted of the drug count; Medina was found\n\nguilty of the drug count and acquitted of the gun count.                 As a\n\nresult, Figueroa was sentenced to 60 months imprisonment and a\n\nsupervised release term of 3 years.           For his part, Medina was\n\nsentenced to 151 months and a supervised release term of 5 years.\n\nIn addition, the district court imposed a $100 special monetary\n\nassessment on each of the men.      This consolidated appeal followed.\n\n                        II.   Figueroa's Claims\n\n          A. Vouching\n\n          Appellant   Figueroa      argues   that,   during    his   closing\n\nargument, the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of\n\nAgents Cruz and Umpierre.2     Because there was no contemporaneous\n\nobjection to the statements, we apply the plain error standard of\n\nreview \"which includes a stiff requirement for showing prejudice.\"\n\nUnited States v. Adams, 305 F.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir. 2002).                 This\n\nCourt evaluates the prosecutor's comments in the context of the\n\n\n2\n   At oral argument, Medina joined Figueroa's vouching claim. We\nneed not decide whether Medina in fact waived the argument by\nfailing to raise it in his brief because the same facts are\ninvolved. The outcome and analysis of either defendant's vouching\nclaim would be the same.\n\n                                    -4-\n\ftrial as a whole.   United States v. Rosales, 19 F.3d 763, 767 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).\n\n           The alleged vouching involved the agents' testimony about\n\na third person who was arrested but not prosecuted.         The trial\n\ntestimony of the two agents established that, while in the process\n\nof arresting Medina, Agent Cruz observed a third person throw\n\nsomething to the ground and asked Agent Umpierre to investigate.\n\nAgent Umpierre discovered a fast food cup that contained 17 bags of\n\ncocaine.   As a result, a third person was arrested, but he was\n\nlater released when the district attorney concluded there was\n\ninsufficient evidence against him.\n\n           During closing arguments, the prosecutor referenced the\n\ntestimony regarding the released third person, stating:\n\n           And what is important about this third person?\n           What is it that they told the district\n           attorney about this third person?         Jose\n           Umpierre told you that they indicated to him\n           exactly what it is that they saw. That Hiram\n           Cruz's testimony was the only thing that\n           linked this person to what was found.\n\n           And Hiram Cruz said I saw him throw something\n           to the ground. I don't know what it is. I\n           cannot say that it's the cup and I will not\n           say that it's that cup.     Based on that the\n           district attorney decided that there wasn't\n           enough to hold this third person and orders to\n           Jose Umpierre to release him. He's not here\n           today. He was not charged.\n\n           Hiram Cruz could have said I saw him throw\n           that cup to the ground.    Even better Hiram\n           Cruz could have said we recovered it from his\n           pocket.   Jose Umpierre could have said we\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f              recovered this from his pocket.           That never\n              happened.\n\n              Figueroa argues that the above statements constituted\n\nimproper vouching or bolstering of the agents' credibility that\n\nunfairly prejudiced him.      In particular, he claims that \"the clear\n\npurpose of the government's argument regarding the release of the\n\nthird person was to persuade the jury that prior to trial the\n\ngovernment engaged in a process to release the arguably innocent\n\nand charge only the unquestionably guilty.\"              He asserts that by\n\nstating that the third person was not prosecuted because the\n\ndistrict attorney thought there was insufficient evidence against\n\nhim, the closing argument implied that the district attorney had\n\ndetermined the evidence against Figueroa and Medina was solid.\n\n              It is well established that federal prosecutors may not\n\nresort   to    improper   means   or    argument   in   order    to   obtain   a\n\nconviction.     See, e.g., United States v. Capone, 683 F.2d 582, 585\n\n(1st Cir. 1982) (\"It is as much [the prosecutor's] duty to refrain\n\nfrom improper methods calculated to produce a conviction as it is\n\nto use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.\").\n\nFurther, the government cannot use the \"prestige of the United\n\nStates\" to bolster the credibility of its witnesses. United States\n\nv. Rosario-Diaz, 202 F.3d 54, 65 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n              The statements complained of, which are quoted above, are\n\nnot even arguably vouching in its classic form.                 The archetypal\n\nexample of vouching is a prosecutor's claim that the witness should\n\n                                       -6-\n\fbe believed because the prosecutor -- a representative of the\n\ngovernment -- believes the witness (hence, the term \"vouching\" as\n\nin \"vouching for\"), and it has been extended to embrace other\n\ninstances in which the prosecutor improperly asks the jury to\n\naccept the government's position on the ground that the government\n\nin general should be believed or should be assumed always to do the\n\nright thing.   See, e.g., United States v. Garza, 608 F.2d 659, 664-\n\n65 (5th Cir. 1979) (finding prosecutor's closing argument improper\n\nwhere he vouched for the integrity of key government witnesses and\n\n\"argued that the prosecution would not have been commenced, and\n\nthat he personally would not have participated unless it had\n\nalready been determined that defendant was guilty\").\n\n           By contrast, the prosecutor's statement in the present\n\ncase followed a different logic.        In substance, the prosecutor\n\nargued, to rebut direct attacks that the police officers had\n\nfabricated their testimony, that the evidence already admitted\n\nshowed that the police had ample opportunity to lie about a third\n\nperson and did not lie, and, therefore, that the police were honest\n\nfolk who should be believed.     The reference to what the prosecutor\n\ndid might conceivably have been taken in the way suggested by\n\ndefense   counsel's   argument   on   appeal   --   that   the   prosecutor\n\nreleases the arguably innocent and charges only the guilty -- but\n\nthe statement that might conceivably lend itself to such a reading\n\nwas overtly offered only to show that the honesty of the policeman\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f(refusing to say that he saw the third person throw down the cup)\n\nled to the inevitable result that there was no evidence against the\n\nthird person and so he was released.\n\n           Perhaps if an objection had been made at the time of\n\ntrial to this limited portion of the three paragraphs quoted above,\n\nthe judge might have instructed the jury to disregard any such\n\nreference as to the district attorney's motives and attitude,\n\nalthough we might regard either the giving or the refusing to give\n\nsuch a caution as a discretionary judgment call.          Alternatively,\n\npossibly   trial   counsel   could   have   articulated   some   different\n\nobjection to the three paragraphs as a whole -- for example, that\n\nthey involved an impermissible attempt to accredit the character of\n\na witness by instances of honesty, cf. Fed. R. Evid. 608 -- but\n\ntrial counsel did not express an objection in these terms.         In sum,\n\nthe objection to the closing, whether characterized as vouching or\n\nsome other terms, is not remotely plain error and that is the end\n\nof the matter.\n\n           B. Failure to Acquit\n\n           Figueroa also argues that he was improperly denied a\n\njudgment of acquittal because the case falls into an exception to\n\nthe Powell-Dunn rule.3       His main contention is that a verdict\n\n\n\n3\n   Under United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57 (1984) and Dunn v.\nUnited States, 284 U.S. 390 (1932), a \"claim that the jury verdict\nis internally inconsistent\" is \"essentially unreviewable.\" United\nStates v. Alicea, 205 F.3d 480, 484 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n                                     -8-\n\facquitting him of the drug count and finding him guilty of the gun\n\ncount is inconsistent because drug possession is an essential\n\nelement of the gun count.   Further, Figueroa argues that the jury\n\nverdict stemmed from the court's refusal to submit the defendant's\n\nspecial verdict form to the jury and from an erroneous jury\n\ninstruction, which mentioned \"sole\" possession.\n\n          Determinations of law are reviewed de novo.       United\n\nStates v. Palmer, 203 F.3d 55, 60 (1st Cir. 2000).   Challenges to\n\njury instructions are reviewed for an abuse of discretion, United\n\nStates v. Ranney, 298 F.3d 74, 79 (1st Cir. 2002), although\n\nalleged \"error[s] 'involving the interpretation of the elements of\n\na statutory offense'\" are reviewed de novo. United States v. Shea,\n\n150 F.3d 44, 49-50 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting United States v.\n\nPitrone, 115 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1997)).\n\n          Figueroa argues here that his gun conviction required\n\nproof of all the elements of a drug trafficking crime.    Figueroa\n\nwas convicted under § 924(c)(1), which imposes a five-year prison\n\nterm on any person who \"uses or carries a firearm\" \"during and in\n\nrelation to any . . . drug trafficking crime.\"        18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(c)(1).   The elements of a § 924(c)(1) offense are: \"(1) that\n\nthe defendant committed the predicate drug trafficking crime. . .;\n\n(2) that the defendant knowingly carried or used a firearm; and (3)\n\nthat the defendant did so during and in relation to the specified\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fpredicate offense.\" United States v. Currier, 151 F.3d 39, 41 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n              We join several of our sister circuits in holding that a\n\ndefendant      may   be   convicted        for   possession     of   a   weapon   in\n\nfurtherance of a drug trafficking crime under § 924(c) even if he\n\nis acquitted of the underlying drug possession crime.4                   See, e.g.,\n\nUnited   States      v.   Frayer,    9   F.3d    1367,   1372   (8th     Cir.   1993)\n\n(requiring \"only that a defendant carry a firearm in connection\n\nwith a drug crime; it is not necessary that he be convicted of the\n\nunderlying drug offense\" in order to be convicted under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(c)); see also United States v. Laing, 889 F.2d 281, 288-89\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1989) (upholding a verdict where defendant was found\n\nguilty of gun charge and acquitted on drug possession count).\n\nThus,    we     uphold     the      jury     verdict     despite     the    alleged\n\ninconsistency.5\n\n\n4\n    This holding is in keeping with our general view that an\ninconsistent verdict should stand where there is sufficient\nevidence to \"sustain a rational verdict of guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\" United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d 33, 41 (1st\nCir. 1991).    Here, there was sufficient evidence to sustain a\nrational verdict of guilt on both counts.     Inter alia, the two\ndefendants were observed to flee together upon hearing the warning\ncall. Drug quantities consistent with distribution purposes were\nfound on co-defendant Medina, and Figueroa had a gun.          The\ngovernment presented expert testimony that drug traffickers\ntypically split up the drugs, money and weapons amongst several\ndealers.   Taken as a whole, the evidence could have rationally\nsustained a verdict on both the gun and drug counts for both\ndefendants.\n5\n    Because we find that a conviction of the predicate drug\npossession offense was unnecessary to the conviction on the gun\n\n                                         -10-\n\f          Figueroa also contends that the verdict resulted from the\n\nuse of the word \"sole\" in the jury instructions over Figueroa's\n\nobjection.6   Figueroa \"contends that the erroneous instruction led\n\nthe jury into error and further warrants a judgment of acquittal.\"\n\nIn this Circuit:\n\n          [i]t is an established appellate rule that\n          'issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,\n          unaccompanied by some effort at developed\n          argumentation, are deemed waived . . . . It is\n          not enough merely to mention a possible\n          argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the\n          court to do counsel's work . . . . Judges are\n          not expected to be mindreaders. Consequently,\n          a litigant has an obligation to spell out its\n          arguments squarely and distinctly, or else\n          forever hold its peace.'\n\nKing v. Town of Hanover, 116 F.3d 965, 970 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting\n\nWillhauck v. Halpin, 953 F.2d 689, 700 (1st Cir. 1991)).\n\n          Here, Figueroa argues that the use of the word \"sole\" was\n\nconfusing to the jury and was inconsistent \"with the facts and the\n\n\n\ncount, we need not address Figueroa's unclear special verdict form\nargument.\n6\n   When the district court instructed the jury as to the gun count\nunder § 924(c)(1), it included the following description as the\nfirst element: \"the defendant committed the crime of possession\nwith intent to distribute cocaine base.\"        According to the\ninstructions, \"'[p]ossession' includes both sole possession and\njoint possession. If one person alone has actual or constructive\npossession, it is sole possession. If two or more persons share\nactual or constructive possession, possession is joint. Whenever\nI have used the word 'possession' in these instructions, I mean\njoint as well as sole possession.\" The instructions also stated\nthat \"[t]he firearm must have played a role in the crime or must\nhave been intended by the defendants to play a role in the crime.\nThat need not have been its sole purpose, however.\"\n\n                                -11-\n\findictment,\" but he does not reference which instance of the word\n\n\"sole\" he finds objectionable or provide any explanation as to how\n\nor why the word might have caused confusion.           He cites no case law\n\nor support for his argument.        As a result, we find Figueroa has\n\nwaived any viable argument he may have had regarding the jury\n\ninstructions.\n\n            C. Response to the Deadlocked Jury's Note\n\n            Figueroa joins Medina in claiming that the district court\n\nerroneously     instructed    the      deadlocked      jury    to    continue\n\ndeliberating.     We address his claim along with Medina's in Part\n\nIII(A) below.\n\n            D. Discovery Regarding U.S. Attorney Gil\n\n            Figueroa's next argument is one we have heard before:\n\nthat \"the district court erred by refusing to allow [him] access to\n\ndiscovery     concerning   [his]    constitutional      challenge     to   the\n\nappointment of United States Attorney Guillermo Gil.\"                  United\n\nStates v. Lopez-Lopez, 282 F.3d 1, 23 (1st Cir. 2002).              Figueroa's\n\nclaim is as meritless as it is familiar.             There is no need to\n\nrevisit the issue since Figueroa concedes that his facial challenge\n\nto the interim appointment mechanism is identical to the one we\n\nrejected in United States v. Hilario, 218 F.3d 19 (1st Cir. 2000),\n\nand   his   as-applied     challenge    mimics   the     one   rejected     in\n\nLopez-Lopez, 282 F.3d at 23.        We reiterate that \"[w]e discourage\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fparties in the future from making arguments, such as this one, that\n\nthis court has already rejected.\"            Lopez-Lopez, 282 F.3d at 23.\n\n           E. Impact of Apprendi\n\n           Finally, Figueroa argues for the first time on appeal\n\nthat the district court should have dismissed the drug count\n\nbecause Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), rendered the\n\nrelevant statute, 21 U.S.C. § 841, unconstitutional. This argument\n\nis wholly meritless, however, and we need not belabor it because\n\nthis   Court    has   upheld    the   validity    of   §   841   post-Apprendi.\n\nLopez-Lopez, 282 F.3d at 22-3.\n\n                           III. Medina's Claims\n\n           A.    Response to the Deadlocked Jury's Note\n\n           Medina     argues7     that   the     district    court   committed\n\nreversible error in its instructions to a deadlocked jury.                 The\n\ntrial lasted twelve days, and after the jury had been deliberating\n\nfor almost four hours, it sent a note to the judge at 8:05 p.m. on\n\nthe night of Friday, September 26, 2000 stating: \"We wish to advise\n\nyou that up to this moment we have not been able to reach an\n\nagreement.      We understand that even if we stay deliberating for\n\nmore time we will not be able to reach a verdict.\"               The judge, who\n\n\n\n\n7\n  Figueroa joins this argument in its entirety.             Our determination\nis the same as to both defendants.\n\n                                      -13-\n\ffelt it was \"too early to give them an Allen charge,\"8 instructed\n\nthe jury as follows:\n\n                  The court received a note from you that\n           basically says that you have not been able to\n           reach an agreement. And you also state that\n           even if you deliberate more time you're not\n           going to reach an agreement.\n                  Well, after a 12 day trial some days we\n           worked eight hours, some days we only worked\n           four hours.     But it's still 12 days of\n           receiving evidence.      I think it is too\n           premature for the judge after 12 days of\n           receiving evidence to accept that there is a\n           deadlock.   These matters do occur, and they\n           occur sometimes more times than we would like,\n           but they occur.\n                  So, what the Court is going to do is to\n           send you home, relax, not think about the case\n           and come back tomorrow at 9:30 AM and at which\n           time I will provide you an instruction.\n           Please do not begin any deliberation until you\n           come back here tomorrow morning.\n\n           Medina did not object to the instructions at trial, thus,\n\nwe review for plain error.    Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).   Under plain\n\nerror review there must be a showing that there is an error, that\n\nthe error is \"clear\" or \"obvious,\" and that it has affected\n\nsubstantial rights by, for example, impacting the outcome of the\n\ntrial.    United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734-35 (1993)\n\n(internal quotations omitted); United States v. Hernandez-Albino,\n\n177 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n\n8\n    See generally Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492 (1896).\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f          The court's comments indicate that the judge did not\n\nperceive the jury to be deadlocked.   Moreover, his instruction to\n\ncontinue deliberating did not contain the coercive elements of a\n\ngarden-variety Allen charge,9 but was merely intended to prod the\n\njury into continuing the effort to reach some unanimous resolution.\n\nIn United States v. Prosperi, 201 F.3d 1555 (11th Cir. 2000), the\n\ncourt determined that a brief, neutral instruction issued under\n\nsimilar circumstances did not constitute an Allen charge:\n\n          The instruction given here . . . cannot be\n          properly considered an Allen charge.       The\n          judge's simple request that the jury continue\n          deliberating, especially when unaware of the\n          composition of the jury's nascent verdict, was\n          routine and neutral.    Nothing in the brief\n          instruction   suggested   that  a   particular\n          outcome was either desired or required and it\n          was not \"inherently coercive.\"\n\nId. at 1341.    The Fifth Circuit has referred to instructions of\n\nthis nature as \"modified Allen charges,\" see United States v.\n\nClayton, 172 F.3d 347, 352 (5th Cir. 1999), and similarly held that\n\nsuch charges do not result in plain error when unaccompanied by\n\nmitigating language emphasizing the jury's right to fail to reach\n\nconsensus.     The salient principle is that such \"counteractive\"\n\nlanguage, see United States v. Manning, 79 F.3d 212, 222 (1st Cir.\n\n\n9\n   In a typical Allen charge, the jurors are told inter alia that\nabsolute certainty cannot be expected in the vast majority of\ncases, that they have a duty to reach a unanimous verdict if they\ncan conscientiously do so, and that dissenting jury members should\naccord some weight to the fact that a majority of jurors hold an\nopposing viewpoint. See Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 494, 501\n(1896).\n\n                               -15-\n\f1996), is only deemed necessary where a \"dynamite charge\" is\n\ndelivered    to    a   deadlocked   jury.     Under   these     circumstances,\n\nmitigating instructions alleviate the prejudice to the defendant\n\narising from the court's insistence that a presumably hung jury\n\nendeavor to reach consensus on either acquittal or conviction.\n\nWhere, as here, the judge reasonably concludes that the jury is not\n\ndeadlocked in the first instance, the defendant is not prejudiced\n\nby a simple instruction to continue deliberating.                The district\n\ncourt's instruction in this case did not imply a duty to achieve\n\nunanimity, nor was it addressed to jurors holding a minority\n\nviewpoint.       See Allen, 164 U.S. at 501.      It stands to reason that\n\nif a district court's instruction lacks the coercive elements of an\n\nAllen charge, it need not include the Allen cure.                   Here, the\n\nrequisite coercion is simply absent and, thus, reversal on this\n\nground is unwarranted.\n\n            B.    References to Medina's Silence\n\n            Appellant Medina raises for the first time on appeal the\n\nargument that Figueroa's counsel and the prosecutor impermissibly\n\ncommented on Medina's decision not to testify on his own behalf at\n\ntrial.      Since      no   contemporaneous   objection   was    made   to   the\n\nstatements, we review for plain error.           United States v. Hughes,\n\n211 F.3d 676, 684 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            Defendants have the constitutional right to remain silent\n\nat trial; when they exercise the right and refuse to testify, it is\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fimproper for comments to be made regarding the silence. See, e.g.,\n\nGriffin   v.   California,   380   U.S.   609,   614-15   (1965)   (holding\n\nprosecutor may not comment on defendant's silence); see also United\n\nStates v. Bonfant, 851 F.2d 12, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1988) (indicating\n\nthat one co-defendant's comments regarding another co-defendant's\n\ndecision not to testify is also problematic).               In evaluating\n\nwhether a comment infringed on a defendant's Fifth Amendment\n\nrights, this Court considers \"'(w)hether the language used was\n\nmanifestly intended or was of such a character that the jury would\n\nnaturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of\n\nthe accused to testify.'\"      Lussier v. Gunter, 552 F.2d 385, 389\n\n(1st Cir. 1977) (quoting Knowles v. United States, 224 F.2d 168,\n\n170 (10th Cir. 1955)).\n\n           First, Medina argues that Figueroa's counsel made several\n\nquestionable comments regarding Medina's silence.          Medina objects\n\nto the fact that Figueroa's counsel argued that Figueroa fully\n\nadmitted his past crimes, pleading guilty or admitting under oath\n\nthat he went for a joy ride in a rental car and that he arrived\n\nillegally in Puerto Rico by boat.         Figueroa's attorney stated:\n\n           Ramón Figueroa Encarnación had no obligation\n           to take the stand and no obligation to bring\n           in documents, had no obligation to bring in\n           witnesses. . . . Why did he do it? Why did\n           he ask me to do it? Because he knew you would\n           never, if you sat here for three whole weeks,\n           get the truth from the mouth of Hiram Cruz,\n           Jose Umpierre and Angel Vargas\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fMedina contends that this impermissibly suggested to the jury that\n\na defendant, such as Medina, that did not take the stand was more\n\nlikely to be guilty.\n\n            The examples cited by appellant Medina simply did not\n\ntrespass on his Fifth Amendment rights.           Where one co-defendant\n\nopts to take the stand and testifies in a manner that benefits the\n\nnon-testifying co-defendant, comment upon the former's decision to\n\ntestify may be permissible.         See, e.g., United States v. Bonfant,\n\n851 F.2d 12, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1988) (allowing comment by co-\n\ndefendant regarding his testimony because the testimony benefitted\n\nboth      defendants      and     because    \"[t]he     privilege   against\n\nself-incrimination of a co-defendant who does not choose to testify\n\ndoes not go so far as to deprive one who does so choose of\n\neffective argument in [her] behalf, so long as it is, as it was\n\nhere, sensitive to the rights of others\").              In the case at bar,\n\nFigueroa chose to testify at trial and his testimony favored both\n\nhimself and Medina.        Figueroa's testimony in no way incriminated\n\nMedina.    When Figueroa's counsel referred to his testimony, he was\n\nattempting to bolster Figueroa's credibility by pointing out to the\n\njury   that    Figueroa     had   admitted   to   his    past   wrongdoings.\n\nFigueroa's counsel was merely seeking to have the jury accept a\n\nversion of events that would lead to an acquittal for both Medina\n\nand Figueroa.     The statements regarding Figueroa's admissions on\n\nthe stand were not of the type that a jury would \"naturally and\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fnecessarily\" take as comments on Medina's own failure to take the\n\nstand.    See Lussier, 552 F.2d at 389.\n\n            Medina's second claim concerns statements made by the\n\nprosecutor.      Medina   challenges      the   prosecutor's   comment   that\n\n\"Counsel asked why didn't the United States call these other police\n\nofficers.     Counsel has the same ability to call these police\n\nofficers and she did not call these police officers.            You have to\n\nask yourself why didn't she call these police officers.\"              Medina\n\nalso objects to the prosecutor's discussion of whether \"Figueroa\n\nreally 'owns up' to things.\"        Finally, Medina takes issue with the\n\nprosecutor's remarks that a defense witness did not telephone the\n\npolice.\n\n            We   find   none   of   the     prosecutor's   comments   to   be\n\nimpermissible infringements on Medina's right to remain silent.\n\nThe first statement merely refers to the failure to call police\n\nofficers as witnesses to support the defense's theory of planted\n\nevidence.     This in no way comments upon Medina's own failure to\n\ntestify.    The second challenged comment is permissible because it\n\nonly rebutted Figueroa's claim that he accepts responsibility for\n\nhis crimes and can in no way be construed as a comment on Medina's\n\nsilence.    Finally, the third statement Medina objects to commented\n\nupon a particular defense witness's credibility.            Again, we think\n\nit is self-evident that the prosecutor's statement could in no way\n\nbe perceived as commenting upon Medina's own silence.\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\f          We   thus     find      that   the       challenged          comments    by   the\n\nprosecutor,    as    well    as   those     by      the    co-defendant,          did   not\n\ntransgress Medina's Fifth Amendment rights.\n\n          C.    Availability of Safety Valve\n\n          Finally,      Medina       argues         that        the     district     court\n\nimpermissibly foreclosed the application of a two level safety\n\nvalve adjustment because of the firearm enhancement.                              Medina's\n\nguideline base offense level was increased by two levels, pursuant\n\nto U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1), because \"a dangerous weapon . . . was\n\npossessed\" during the course of the offense.                            Medina does not\n\ncontest   on   appeal       the   applicability            of    the     §   2D1.1(b)(1)\n\nenhancement for possession of a firearm, but he contends that the\n\nfirearm enhancement does not preclude the application of the\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5C1.2 safety valve.\n\n          Under § 5C1.2, a defendant is eligible for a two level\n\nguideline reduction if he meets the enumerated criteria.                          Here, we\n\nare only concerned whether the defendant could meet the requirement\n\nthat he \"did not use violence or credible threats of violence or\n\npossess a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another\n\nparticipant to do so) in connection with the offense.\"                        U.S.S.G. §\n\n5C1.2(a)(2).        Application      Note      4    to    this        guideline    section\n\nindicates \"the term 'defendant,' as used in subsection (a)(2),\n\nlimits the accountability of the defendant to his own conduct and\n\n\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\fconduct that he aided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced,\n\nprocured, or willfully caused.\"\n\n          Five of our sister circuits have found that application\n\nof § 5C1.2 is not precluded by a weapons possession sentence\n\nenhancement based on co-conspirator liability.       See United States\n\nv. Pena-Sarabia, 297 F.3d 983, 989 (10th Cir. 2002) (holding \"a\n\njoint criminal actor's firearm possession is not attributable to a\n\ndefendant for purposes of applying the mandatory minimum safety\n\nvalve provision\"); United States v. Clavijo, 165 F.3d 1341, 1343-44\n\n(11th Cir. 1999) (finding defendant was \"entitled to safety-valve\n\nrelief even though his co-defendant possessed a firearm\"); United\n\nStates v. Wilson, 114 F.3d 429, 432 (4th Cir. 1997) (refusing to\n\nattribute co-conspirators possession of a firearm to the defendant\n\nfor the purpose of blocking the safety valve's application); United\n\nStates v. Wilson, 105 F.3d 219, 222 (5th Cir. 1997) (agreeing that\n\nsafety valve relief was not precluded unless defendant himself\n\n\"actually possessed a firearm during the conspiracy\"); In re Sealed\n\nCase, 105 F.3d 1460, 1462 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (holding that \"co-\n\nconspirator   liability   cannot    establish   possession   under   the\n\nGuideline's safety valve\").    We agree -- in order for the safety\n\nvalve to be precluded because of a firearm enhancement, a defendant\n\nmust possess or induce another to possess a firearm in accordance\n\nwith § 5C1.2(2)(a)(2).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\f          Although we find that any automatic equation of the\n\npossession of a firearm by another and unavailability of the safety\n\nvalve is mistaken, the basis for the district court's action is\n\nunclear here.   We thus find it necessary to remand to the district\n\ncourt for proper justification for the preclusion of safety valve\n\nrelief or, absent such a justification, for resentencing consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n                          IV.   Conclusion\n\n          For the above reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ndecision in part and reverse and remand in part.\n\n          Affirmed in part, reversed and remanded in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                -22-\n\f",

Co-defendants and appellants\n\nRamón   Figueroa      Encarnación         (\"Figueroa\")       and    Alberto     Medina\n\n(\"Medina\") were charged in a two count indictment with (1) aiding\n\nand abetting each other in the knowing, intentional and willful\n\npossession with intent to distribute of fifty grams of cocaine base\n\n(crack cocaine) in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841 and 18 U.S.C. § 2\n\n(\"drug count\"); and (2) aiding and abetting each other in the\n\nknowing possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug\n\ntrafficking crime, in contravention of 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3) (\"gun\n\ncount\").     Figueroa was convicted of the gun count and acquitted of\n\nthe   drug   count;    Medina       was   convicted    of    the    drug     count   and\n\nacquitted of the gun count.               Both now appeal, presenting various\n\nclaims of     error.        After    careful      review,    we    affirm    Figueroa-\n\nEncarnación's       conviction      in    its    entirety;   we    affirm     Medina's\n\nconviction     in    part    and    reverse      and   remand      it   in   part    for\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                   I.     Background\n\n             On February 4, 1999, the Arrest and Search Warrant\n\nDivision1 (\"the Division\") of the Puerto Rico Police Department\n\n(\"PRPD\") began a new program to investigate drug trafficking in the\n\n\n\n1\n   The purpose of the Division was to 1) investigate various drug\ntrafficking locations, also known as \"drug points\"; 2) determine\nthe location of the drugs and weapons at these drug points; and 3)\nobtain search warrants from local judges in order to seize the\ndrugs and weapons and to arrest the individuals involved in drug\ntrafficking.\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJardines de Campo Rico Housing Project in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico\n\n(\"Campo Rico Project\").        At the time, the Campo Rico Project\n\ncontained various known or suspected drug dealing points, including\n\none at the boundary with a privately owned complex, the Jardines de\n\nBerwind Condominium (\"Berwind Condominium\").\n\n          On February 4, 1999, three plain-clothed agents, Hiram\n\nCruz Alvarez (\"Agent Cruz\"), Angel Vargas Cruz (\"Agent Vargas\") and\n\nJose Umpierre (\"Agent Umpierre\"), were assigned to conduct the\n\nsurveillance of the drug dealing points at the Campo Rico Project.\n\nPart of the plan for surveillance involved securing an upper-floor\n\napartment in Berwind Condominiums as a vantage point.\n\n          According    to    the   government's   evidence,   Agent   Cruz\n\nobserved Figueroa and Medina standing together at a known drug\n\ndealing point, the fence next to the Campo Rico Project.              When\n\nsomeone in the project yelled \"agua\" -- a code word for police\n\npresence in the area -- Medina and Figueroa turned simultaneously\n\nand headed towards the stairs of the Berwind Condominium.             Agent\n\nCruz identified himself as a police officer, and then Medina and\n\nFigueroa split up and ran in different directions.            Agent Cruz\n\narrested Medina, who had in his possession a number of vials of\n\ncrack cocaine.   In addition, Medina possessed $108 in bills of\n\nsmall denominations.

The trial\n\ntestimony of the two agents established that, while in the process\n\nof arresting Medina, Agent Cruz observed a third person throw\n\nsomething to the ground and asked Agent Umpierre to investigate.\n\nAgent Umpierre discovered a fast food cup that contained 17 bags of\n\ncocaine.   As a result, a third person was arrested, but he was\n\nlater released when the district attorney concluded there was\n\ninsufficient evidence against him.\n\n           During closing arguments, the prosecutor referenced the\n\ntestimony regarding the released third person, stating:\n\n           And what is important about this third person?\n           What is it that they told the district\n           attorney about this third person?         Jose\n           Umpierre told you that they indicated to him\n           exactly what it is that they saw. That Hiram\n           Cruz's testimony was the only thing that\n           linked this person to what was found.\n\n           And Hiram Cruz said I saw him throw something\n           to the ground. I don't know what it is. I\n           cannot say that it's the cup and I will not\n           say that it's that cup.     Based on that the\n           district attorney decided that there wasn't\n           enough to hold this third person and orders to\n           Jose Umpierre to release him. He's not here\n           today. He was not charged.\n\n           Hiram Cruz could have said I saw him throw\n           that cup to the ground.    Even better Hiram\n           Cruz could have said we recovered it from his\n           pocket.   Jose Umpierre could have said we\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f              recovered this from his pocket.           That never\n              happened.\n\n              Figueroa argues that the above statements constituted\n\nimproper vouching or bolstering of the agents' credibility that\n\nunfairly prejudiced him.      In particular, he claims that \"the clear\n\npurpose of the government's argument regarding the release of the\n\nthird person was to persuade the jury that prior to trial the\n\ngovernment engaged in a process to release the arguably innocent\n\nand charge only the unquestionably guilty.\"              He asserts that by\n\nstating that the third person was not prosecuted because the\n\ndistrict attorney thought there was insufficient evidence against\n\nhim, the closing argument implied that the district attorney had\n\ndetermined the evidence against Figueroa and Medina was solid.\n\n              It is well established that federal prosecutors may not\n\nresort   to    improper   means   or    argument   in   order    to   obtain   a\n\nconviction.

The archetypal\n\nexample of vouching is a prosecutor's claim that the witness should\n\n                                       -6-\n\fbe believed because the prosecutor -- a representative of the\n\ngovernment -- believes the witness (hence, the term \"vouching\" as\n\nin \"vouching for\"), and it has been extended to embrace other\n\ninstances in which the prosecutor improperly asks the jury to\n\naccept the government's position on the ground that the government\n\nin general should be believed or should be assumed always to do the\n\nright thing.   See, e.g., United States v. Garza, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"371152\"><a href=\"/opinion/371152/united-states-v-david-garza/\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 664-\n\n65 (5th Cir. 1979) (finding prosecutor's closing argument improper\n\nwhere he vouched for the integrity of key government witnesses and\n\n\"argued that the prosecution would not have been commenced, and\n\nthat he personally would not have participated unless it had\n\nalready been determined that defendant was guilty\").\n\n           By contrast, the prosecutor's statement in the present\n\ncase followed a different logic.        In substance, the prosecutor\n\nargued, to rebut direct attacks that the police officers had\n\nfabricated their testimony, that the evidence already admitted\n\nshowed that the police had ample opportunity to lie about a third\n\nperson and did not lie, and, therefore, that the police were honest\n\nfolk who should be believed.     The reference to what the prosecutor\n\ndid might conceivably have been taken in the way suggested by\n\ndefense   counsel's   argument   on   appeal   --   that   the   prosecutor\n\nreleases the arguably innocent and charges only the guilty -- but\n\nthe statement that might conceivably lend itself to such a reading\n\nwas overtly offered only to show that the honesty of the policeman\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f(refusing to say that he saw the third person throw down the cup)\n\nled to the inevitable result that there was no evidence against the\n\nthird person and so he was released.\n\n           Perhaps if an objection had been made at the time of\n\ntrial to this limited portion of the three paragraphs quoted above,\n\nthe judge might have instructed the jury to disregard any such\n\nreference as to the district attorney's motives and attitude,\n\nalthough we might regard either the giving or the refusing to give\n\nsuch a caution as a discretionary judgment call.          Alternatively,\n\npossibly   trial   counsel   could   have   articulated   some   different\n\nobjection to the three paragraphs as a whole -- for example, that\n\nthey involved an impermissible attempt to accredit the character of\n\na witness by instances of honesty, cf. Fed. R. Evid. 608 -- but\n\ntrial counsel did not express an objection in these terms.

And you also state that\n           even if you deliberate more time you're not\n           going to reach an agreement.\n                  Well, after a 12 day trial some days we\n           worked eight hours, some days we only worked\n           four hours.     But it's still 12 days of\n           receiving evidence.      I think it is too\n           premature for the judge after 12 days of\n           receiving evidence to accept that there is a\n           deadlock.   These matters do occur, and they\n           occur sometimes more times than we would like,\n           but they occur.\n                  So, what the Court is going to do is to\n           send you home, relax, not think about the case\n           and come back tomorrow at 9:30 AM and at which\n           time I will provide you an instruction.\n           Please do not begin any deliberation until you\n           come back here tomorrow morning.\n\n           Medina did not object to the instructions at trial, thus,\n\nwe review for plain error.

Moreover, his instruction to\n\ncontinue deliberating did not contain the coercive elements of a\n\ngarden-variety Allen charge,9 but was merely intended to prod the\n\njury into continuing the effort to reach some unanimous resolution.\n\nIn United States v.

The\n          judge's simple request that the jury continue\n          deliberating, especially when unaware of the\n          composition of the jury's nascent verdict, was\n          routine and neutral.    Nothing in the brief\n          instruction   suggested   that  a   particular\n          outcome was either desired or required and it\n          was not \"inherently coercive.\"\n\nId. at 1341.    The Fifth Circuit has referred to instructions of\n\nthis nature as \"modified Allen charges,\" see United States v.\n\nClayton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762770\"><a href=\"/opinion/762770/united-states-of-america-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-ronald/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 352 (5th Cir. 1999), and similarly held that\n\nsuch charges do not result in plain error when unaccompanied by\n\nmitigating language emphasizing the jury's right to fail to reach\n\nconsensus.     The salient principle is that such \"counteractive\"\n\nlanguage, see United States v.

See Allen v.

Under   these     circumstances,\n\nmitigating instructions alleviate the prejudice to the defendant\n\narising from the court's insistence that a presumably hung jury\n\nendeavor to reach consensus on either acquittal or conviction.\n\nWhere, as here, the judge reasonably concludes that the jury is not\n\ndeadlocked in the first instance, the defendant is not prejudiced\n\nby a simple instruction to continue deliberating.                The district\n\ncourt's instruction in this case did not imply a duty to achieve\n\nunanimity, nor was it addressed to jurors holding a minority\n\nviewpoint.       See Allen, 164 U.S. at 501.      It stands to reason that\n\nif a district court's instruction lacks the coercive elements of an\n\nAllen charge, it need not include the Allen cure.                   Here, the\n\nrequisite coercion is simply absent and, thus, reversal on this\n\nground is unwarranted.\n\n            B.    References to Medina's Silence\n\n            Appellant Medina raises for the first time on appeal the\n\nargument that Figueroa's counsel and the prosecutor impermissibly\n\ncommented on Medina's decision not to testify on his own behalf at\n\ntrial.      Since      no   contemporaneous   objection   was    made   to   the\n\nstatements, we review for plain error.           United States v.

Medina objects\n\nto the fact that Figueroa's counsel argued that Figueroa fully\n\nadmitted his past crimes, pleading guilty or admitting under oath\n\nthat he went for a joy ride in a rental car and that he arrived\n\nillegally in Puerto Rico by boat.         Figueroa's attorney stated:\n\n           Ramón Figueroa Encarnación had no obligation\n           to take the stand and no obligation to bring\n           in documents, had no obligation to bring in\n           witnesses. . . . Why did he do it? Why did\n           he ask me to do it? Because he knew you would\n           never, if you sat here for three whole weeks,\n           get the truth from the mouth of Hiram Cruz,\n           Jose Umpierre and Angel Vargas\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fMedina contends that this impermissibly suggested to the jury that\n\na defendant, such as Medina, that did not take the stand was more\n\nlikely to be guilty.\n\n            The examples cited by appellant Medina simply did not\n\ntrespass on his Fifth Amendment rights.           Where one co-defendant\n\nopts to take the stand and testifies in a manner that benefits the\n\nnon-testifying co-defendant, comment upon the former's decision to\n\ntestify may be permissible.         See, e.g., United States v. Bonfant,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508509\"><a href=\"/opinion/508509/united-states-v-corrado-bonfant-united-states-of-america-v-mary-az/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1988) (allowing comment by co-\n\ndefendant regarding his testimony because the testimony benefitted\n\nboth      defendants      and     because    \"[t]he     privilege   against\n\nself-incrimination of a co-defendant who does not choose to testify\n\ndoes not go so far as to deprive one who does so choose of\n\neffective argument in [her] behalf, so long as it is, as it was\n\nhere, sensitive to the rights of others\").              In the case at bar,\n\nFigueroa chose to testify at trial and his testimony favored both\n\nhimself and Medina.        Figueroa's testimony in no way incriminated\n\nMedina.    When Figueroa's counsel referred to his testimony, he was\n\nattempting to bolster Figueroa's credibility by pointing out to the\n\njury   that    Figueroa     had   admitted   to   his    past   wrongdoings.\n\nFigueroa's counsel was merely seeking to have the jury accept a\n\nversion of events that would lead to an acquittal for both Medina\n\nand Figueroa.     The statements regarding Figueroa's admissions on\n\nthe stand were not of the type that a jury would \"naturally and\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fnecessarily\" take as comments on Medina's own failure to take the\n\nstand.    See Lussier, 552 F.2d at 389.\n\n            Medina's second claim concerns statements made by the\n\nprosecutor.      Medina   challenges      the   prosecutor's   comment   that\n\n\"Counsel asked why didn't the United States call these other police\n\nofficers.     Counsel has the same ability to call these police\n\nofficers and she did not call these police officers.            You have to\n\nask yourself why didn't she call these police officers.\"              Medina\n\nalso objects to the prosecutor's discussion of whether \"Figueroa\n\nreally 'owns up' to things.\"        Finally, Medina takes issue with the\n\nprosecutor's remarks that a defense witness did not telephone the\n\npolice.\n\n            We   find   none   of   the     prosecutor's   comments   to   be\n\nimpermissible infringements on Medina's right to remain silent.\n\nThe first statement merely refers to the failure to call police\n\nofficers as witnesses to support the defense's theory of planted\n\nevidence.     This in no way comments upon Medina's own failure to\n\ntestify.    The second challenged comment is permissible because it\n\nonly rebutted Figueroa's claim that he accepts responsibility for\n\nhis crimes and can in no way be construed as a comment on Medina's\n\nsilence.    Finally, the third statement Medina objects to commented\n\nupon a particular defense witness's credibility.            Again, we think\n\nit is self-evident that the prosecutor's statement could in no way\n\nbe perceived as commenting upon Medina's own silence.\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\f          We   thus     find      that   the       challenged          comments    by   the\n\nprosecutor,    as    well    as   those     by      the    co-defendant,          did   not\n\ntransgress Medina's Fifth Amendment rights.\n\n          C.    Availability of Safety Valve\n\n          Finally,      Medina       argues         that        the     district     court\n\nimpermissibly foreclosed the application of a two level safety\n\nvalve adjustment because of the firearm enhancement.                              Medina's\n\nguideline base offense level was increased by two levels, pursuant\n\nto U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1), because \"a dangerous weapon . . . was\n\npossessed\" during the course of the offense.                            Medina does not\n\ncontest   on   appeal       the   applicability            of    the     §   2D1.1(b)(1)\n\nenhancement for possession of a firearm, but he contends that the\n\nfirearm enhancement does not preclude the application of the\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5C1.2 safety valve.\n\n          Under § 5C1.2, a defendant is eligible for a two level\n\nguideline reduction if he meets the enumerated criteria.                          Here, we\n\nare only concerned whether the defendant could meet the requirement\n\nthat he \"did not use violence or credible threats of violence or\n\npossess a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another\n\nparticipant to do so) in connection with the offense.\"                        U.S.S.G. §\n\n5C1.2(a)(2).        Application      Note      4    to    this        guideline    section\n\nindicates \"the term 'defendant,' as used in subsection (a)(2),\n\nlimits the accountability of the defendant to his own conduct and\n\n\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\fconduct that he aided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced,\n\nprocured, or willfully caused.\"\n\n          Five of our sister circuits have found that application\n\nof § 5C1.2 is not precluded by a weapons possession sentence\n\nenhancement based on co-conspirator liability.
