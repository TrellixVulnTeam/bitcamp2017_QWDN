Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                    Torruella, Lynch and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     David A. Perry on brief pro se.\n     Daniel J. Mullen, Associate Attorney General on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                             March 29, 2005\n\f             Per Curiam.      Plaintiff-appellant David A. Perry has\n\nappealed the district court's dismissal of his complaint. We can\n\naffirm a district court's judgment on any ground supported by the\n\nrecord.     Campagna v. Massachusetts Dep't of Envtl. Prot., 334\n\nF.3d 150, 155 (1st Cir. 2003).         Upon our review, we conclude that\n\nres     judicata    is   an     appropriate     ground   for    dismissal.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm.1\n\n             We reject Perry's contentions that there was no final\n\nstate court judgment on the merits and that he did not have a\n\nfull and fair opportunity to litigate his constitutional claims\n\nin the state courts.          Perry argues that the August 2003 state\n\ntrial     court   decision    simply   ruled   that   neither   habeas   nor\n\nmandamus were proper forms for relief.          However, the state court\n\ndescribed the legal standard it applied in testing the facts\n\nalleged in the pleading and in finding dismissal appropriate,\n\ni.e., where the plaintiff's allegations are not \"reasonably\n\nsusceptible of a construction that would permit recovery\" and\n\nwhere \"the facts as pled do not constitute a basis for legal\n\nrelief.\"     We believe this description sufficiently evidences the\n\ncourt's conclusion that Perry's constitutional claims provided no\n\nbasis for any type of legal\n\n\n      1\n      Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83\n(1998) is not a bar to our disposition. See Penobscot Nation v.\nGeorgia-Pacific Corp., 254 F.3d 317, 324-25 (1st Cir. 2001)\n(bypassing the question of subject matter jurisdiction to conclude\nthat relief was foreclosed on res judicata grounds).\n\n                                       -2-\n\frelief and not simply that they lacked a basis for habeas or\n\nmandamus relief.\n\n            Moreover,       Perry     raised    his     complaint       about      the\n\ndecision's alleged inadequacy both on reconsideration before the\n\ntrial court and in what he termed a \"Petition for Original\n\nJurisdiction\"    to    the    state    supreme      court.       He    also     again\n\nreiterated his constitutional claims and argued that, if neither\n\nhabeas nor mandamus relief were appropriate, the courts should\n\naward any \"alternative\" form of relief.                The trial court denied\n\nreconsideration       and    the    state    supreme    court,    treating         the\n\npetition before it as an appeal, declined to hear the case.\n\nThese subsequent state court decisions reinforce our view that\n\nthe state courts have determined that Perry was not entitled to\n\nany form of relief.\n\n            Just as importantly, however, Perry ignores the fact\n\nthat he had earlier pursued and lost a challenge to the two year\n\nlicense suspension for his refusal of the breathalyzer test.\n\nPerry challenged the factual finding that he had refused the\n\nbreathalyzer    test.         He     lost    that     challenge       both    on    an\n\nadministrative appeal and subsequently in the state superior\n\ncourt, the effect of which was to uphold the resulting imposition\n\nof   the   consecutive      two     year    license    suspension.           The   New\n\nHampshire Supreme Court declined to hear his appeal and Perry did\n\nnot seek certiorari to the United States Supreme Court.                         Perry\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fdoes       not   contest   the   district   court's   description   of   New\n\nHampshire's application of res judicata as including \"matters\n\nthat could have been litigated in an earlier action between the\n\nsame parties for the same cause of action\" and there is nothing\n\nto suggest that, simultaneously with his challenge to the factual\n\nfinding that he had refused the breathalyzer test, Perry could\n\nnot have also raised his claims as to the constitutionality of\n\nthe    consecutive     two   year   license   suspension.    Accordingly,\n\nPerry's current claims are foreclosed by res judicata.2\n\n                 The judgment of the district court dismissing the\n\ncomplaint is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      Perry contends that the defendant-appellee's motion to\ndismiss was tardily filed and, thus, the affirmative defense of res\njudicata was waived.      The irony is that Perry raises this\ncontention for the first time on appeal and seeks to excuse his own\nforfeiture in order to assert this waiver bar against the\ndefendant-appellee. Perry proffers no justifiable ground for his\nfailure to allege untimeliness and waiver below. On plain error\nreview, we refuse Perry's request that we find waiver. Assuming\nwithout deciding that the motion to dismiss was late, the district\ncourt, by considering the motion to dismiss, at least implicitly\nexcused its alleged tardiness and we would not find an abuse of\ndiscretion in its doing so.\n\n                                      -4-\n\f",
