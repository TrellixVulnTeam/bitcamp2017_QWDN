Rios Rosario for appellant Valle-Lasalle.\n\n     William C. Brown, Attorney, U.S. Department of Justice, with\nwhom H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                        February 7, 2003\n\fH.   Apprendi (Nelson, Rodriguez, Arroyo, Bonet, Chevere, Caribe,\n\nRivera, and Valle)\n\n     All of the appellants except for Romero, who pled guilty,\n\nargue that their sentences were imposed in violation of Apprendi v.\n\nNew Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).        Apprendi held that \"[o]ther than\n\nthe fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty\n\nfor a     crime   beyond   the   prescribed   statutory   maximum   must   be\n\nsubmitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"          Id. at\n\n2362-63.    The defendants raise several distinct Apprendi claims,\n\nand we address each in turn.\n\n     1.    Facial Challenge to 21 U.S.C. § 841\n\n     The defendants make a facial challenge to 21 U.S.C. § 841.13\n\nSection 841(a) makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly or\n\nintentionally distribute or possess with intent to distribute a\n\ncontrolled substance.        Section 841(b) lists the penalties for\n\nviolation of section 841(a), which vary depending on the drug type\n\nand quantity.      Defendants say this renders the statute facially\n\nunconstitutional.\n\n     This argument about § 841 is foreclosed by United States v.\n\nCollazo-Aponte, 281 F.3d 320 (1st. Cir. 2002), which held that\n\n\"there is nothing in the statutory language that explicitly defies\n\n\n     13\n        The defendants were convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 846, not\n21 U.S.C. § 841, but they challenge § 841 because § 846 makes it\nunlawful to attempt or conspire to commit the offenses listed in §\n841. Therefore, the constitutionality of § 846 is dependent upon\nthe constitutionality of § 841.\n\n                                     -55-\n\fApprendi\" because \"[t]he statute is silent as to who makes these\n\nfindings and under what burden of persuasion.\"      Id. at 325.   Our\n\ndecision in Collazo-Aponte is consistent with the decisions of all\n\ncircuits that have addressed this issue.    See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Buckland, 289 F.3d 558, 562 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc); United\n\nStates v. McAllister, 272 F.3d 228, 232 (4th Cir. 2001); United\n\nStates v. Brough, 243 F.3d 1078, 1079 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 534\n\nU.S. 889 (2001).\n\n     Collazo-Aponte similarly rejected the claim that § 841(b)\n\nincludes a mens rea requirement as to the type and quantity of\n\ndrugs.    Section 841(a) requires the defendant to \"knowingly or\n\nintentionally\" possess controlled substances with an intent to\n\ndistribute.   The defendants argue that this mens rea requirement\n\napplies to all elements of the crime, including those listed in §\n\n841(b). However, as we held in Collazo-Aponte, \"The plain language\n\nof § 841(b) requires the government to prove only that the offense\n\n'involved' a particular type and quantity of drugs, not that the\n\ndefendant knew that he was distributing that particular drug type\n\nand quantity.\"     281 F.3d at 326.    The presumption in favor of a\n\nscienter requirement does not apply in this case because the\n\nelements in § 841(b) only set the penalty and do not criminalize\n\notherwise innocent conduct.\n\n     2.   Vague Allegations in Indictment\n\n     Defendants argue that the indictment was inadequate in that it\n\n\n                                -56-\n\fmade only vague allegations as to the type and quantity of the\n\ndrugs involved in the conspiracy.              It is true that Apprendi\n\nconsiders any fact (other than a prior conviction) that increases\n\nthe penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum to be an\n\nelement of the crime.      But the indictment here easily meets this\n\nrequirement.      The    superseding       indictment    charged   that     the\n\ndefendants possessed with intent to distribute over 1,000 kilograms\n\nof   cocaine,   five    kilograms   of   heroin,   and    5,000    pounds    of\n\nmarijuana. Furthermore, it provided the drug type and quantity for\n\neach of the planned importations at issue at trial, stating for\n\nexample that Arroyo and Rivera met \"two other persons known to the\n\nGrand Jury,\" CIS Hernandez and Diaz, to discuss the importation of\n\napproximately 1,200 kilograms of cocaine into Puerto Rico in May\n\n1997, and that Rivera, Torres, and Chevere received a shipment of\n\n250 kilograms of cocaine in July 1997.           Such detail is more than\n\nsufficient to meet Apprendi's mandate, and we therefore reject\n\ndefendants' claim.\n\n      3.   Lack of Jury Determination of Drug Type and Quantity\n\n      Defendants argue that their sentences must be vacated because\n\nthe jury did not determine drug type or quantity.             In fact, the\n\njury verdict sheet asked simply whether a particular defendant was\n\nguilty of the one count in the indictment, a copy of which was\n\nprovided to the jury.      The indictment charged that the defendants\n\n      did unlawfully, knowingly, willfully, and intentionally\n      combine, conspire, confederate, and agree together with divers\n\n                                    -57-\n\f      other persons to the Grand Jury known and unknown, to possess\n      with intent to distribute amounts of cocaine, a Schedule II\n      narcotic drug controlled substance, which amounts of cocaine\n      exceeded One Thousand (1,000) kilograms; heroin, a Schedule I,\n      Narcotic Drug Controlled Substance, which amounts of heroin\n      exceeded Five (5) kilograms; and marijuana, a Schedule I\n      controlled substance, which amounts exceeded Five Thousand\n      (5,000) pounds of marijuana\n\n\n(emphasis added).    It also specified particular amounts and kinds\n\nof drugs for transactions in which those defendants participated.\n\n      We understand the argument to have several parts, including\n\nfirst that the jury, at a minimum, had to decide the drug quantity\n\nand   type   for   the   underlying   conspiracy   (to   the   extent   of\n\ndetermining a quantity which sets the maximum sentence under § 841\n\nthat would be applicable to the conspirators).       The argument moves\n\nto another level with the assertion that it was error for the trial\n\njudge to deny the requests of several defendants that the jury make\n\nan individualized determination as to the drug type and quantity\n\nwhich could be attributed to that defendant.        Both arguments have\n\nin common the assertion that Apprendi required these issues to be\n\nsubmitted to the jury in light of the fact that the defendants\n\nreceived sentences greater than the default statutory maximum. The\n\nrelevant default statutory maximum is based on distribution of less\n\nthan 50 kilograms of marijuana, which produces a maximum sentence\n\nof five years for first felony drug convictions and ten years if\n\nthere is a prior such conviction.        21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D).\n\n      It is common ground, and the government concedes, that the\n\n\n                                  -58-\n\fdefendants were entitled to some form of jury determination as to\n\nquantity -- whether general or individual is a separate question --\n\nbefore being subject to more than the default statutory maximum.\n\nHere, there was no jury determination of either sort.               One might\n\nsuppose from the indictment quoted above that the jury necessarily\n\nfound the quantities there specified, but in fact review of the\n\njury   instructions   confirms   that    the   jury   was   asked    only   to\n\ndetermine whether there was a conspiracy as charged, not whether it\n\ncovered any specific amounts of drugs.          The government does not\n\nclaim otherwise.\n\n       However, the jury's failure to determine drug type and amount\n\nis not fatal if the evidence overwhelmingly establishes the amount.\n\nUnited States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625 (2002).           In this instance,\n\nour review shows that this is so as to all defendants, whether the\n\ntest is plain error or harmless error and whether the figure\n\nrelates to the overall conspiracy or to the individual defendant.\n\nWe will return to these calculations in due course.            But for the\n\nsake of future litigation, it is useful to say something more about\n\nboth the requirements for preservation of Apprendi claims and the\n\nproblem of general versus specific findings as to amount of drugs.\n\nWe begin with the latter.\n\n       In United States v. Derman, 298 F.3d 34, 42-44 (1st Cir.\n\n2002), this court ruled that it was sufficient to satisfy Apprendi\n\nif the jury found that the conspiracy charged was to distribute, or\n\n\n                                  -59-\n\fpossess with intent to distribute, a specific quantity (assuming\n\nthat this figure triggered the higher maximum sentence at issue).\n\nIf   the   defendant   were   convicted   of   participating   in   such   a\n\nconspiracy, this necessarily meant that he was liable, for Apprendi\n\npurposes, for the quantity of the overall conspiracy. We therefore\n\nheld that there was no Apprendi error where a jury\n\n      has determined that the conspiracy involved a type and\n      quantity of drugs sufficient to justify a sentence above the\n      default statutory maximum and has found a particular defendant\n      guilty of participation in the conspiracy[.]         [In this\n      situation,] the judge lawfully may determine the drug quantity\n      attributable to that defendant and sentence him accordingly\n      (so long as the sentence falls within the statutory maximum\n      made applicable by the jury's conspiracy-wide drug quantity\n      determination).\n\n\nDerman, 298 F.3d at 43.\n\n      A number of other circuits have taken the same view as to the\n\nissue required to be decided by the jury if the default maximum is\n\nto be exceeded.   See United States v. Thomas, 274 F.3d 655 (2d Cir.\n\n2001); United States v. Patterson, 241 F.3d 912 (7th Cir. 2001);\n\nUnited States v. Nance, 236 F.3d 820 (7th Cir. 2000).          Of course,\n\nsuch a jury determination by itself merely establishes a new\n\nstatutory maximum under Apprendi; it does not set the defendant's\n\nguideline sentence, which will often be less than the statutory\n\nmaximum and which depends on numerous determinations specific to\n\nthe individual defendant, including role in the offense, attributed\n\nrelevant conduct, past criminal history, and the like.\n\n      Derman thus answers in this circuit the defendants' claim that\n\n                                   -60-\n\fthey are entitled under Apprendi to a defendant-specific finding by\n\nthe jury as to the amount of drugs properly attributed to an\n\nindividual defendant in a conspiracy case.          But we recognize that\n\nthis is not necessarily the last word on the subject. Conceivably,\n\nborrowing     from   related   doctrines,   one      could    construct   a\n\nforeseeability test of some kind -- attributing to each defendant\n\nthe amount that the individual agreed upon, actually handled, and\n\nreasonably could have foreseen that others would handle -- and\n\ncould ask the jury by special interrogatories to identify such an\n\namount.\n\n     Derman    itself   involved   a   relatively    simple    conspiracy:\n\ngrowing marijuana in an underground greenhouse, first on Derman's\n\nproperty, then on another's.       See 298 F.3d at 37.       In such cases,\n\nit would be a simple matter for the government to indict on the\n\ncharge that a particular defendant joined an agreement to possess\n\nthe quantity of drugs grown in the greenhouse, with the intent to\n\ndistribute that quantity, and to seek a special verdict to that\n\neffect.     That simple approach may break down for more complex\n\nconspiracies involving multiple transactions of different amounts\n\nof drugs imported at different times, with a shifting cast of\n\nactors.   A series of problems implicating sentencing then arises.\n\nA particular defendant, for example, may have agreed to import\n\nseven kilograms of a drug, but not agreed to import ten, although\n\nit was reasonably foreseeable to him that his coconspirators would\n\n\n                                   -61-\n\fimport ten.     Or a particular defendant may have gone in and then\n\nout of a conspiracy.     See Edwards v. United States, 523 U.S. 511\n\n(1998).   There may be one conspiracy; there may be multiple\n\nconspiracies.     Or a defendant may raise Pinkerton issues.         See\n\nPinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640 (1946).         Some of these\n\nproblems might be solved by more specificity in indictments, by\n\ntailored instructions, and by special verdicts.\n\n     Such an endeavor would pose issues of its own too numerous to\n\nrecount in full.    It would implicate the instructions that define\n\nconspiracy, itself a tangled subject with built-in tension.           It\n\ncould also have practical disadvantages for some defendants by\n\ncompromising later arguments they might otherwise make to the judge\n\nconcerning the application of the sentencing guidelines.             But\n\nApprendi itself is a recent innovation; it is too early to expect\n\nall of its implications to be worked out, and only the Supreme\n\nCourt can provide final guidance.        It is enough here that Derman\n\nprovides provisional guidance for the circuit and that the outcome\n\nfor the defendants in this case would not change even if Derman\n\nwere overturned.\n\n     In explaining this last determination, we consider first        the\n\nlevel of review to which each defendant is entitled and then\n\nexamine   separately    the   evidence    bearing   on   drug   quantity\n\nattributable to each individual defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -62-\n\f      a.     Preservation of Objection\n\n      Valle's appeal raises the question, new to us, of what must be\n\ndone at trial to preserve an Apprendi objection.                Valle was\n\nconvicted at the second trial, after the Apprendi decision.14           In\n\nour   only    case   holding   an   Apprendi   objection   preserved,   the\n\nobjection was raised both at trial and at sentencing.              United\n\nStates v. Bailey, 270 F.3d 83, 88-90 (1st Cir. 2001).         Apprendi is\n\nprimarily about sentencing, but it also has implications for\n\nindictment and trial, at least in relation to a sentence which\n\nrests on facts which elevate the sentence above the statutory\n\nminimum.\n\n      For future cases, we think it sufficient if the defendant\n\nraises the issue at sentencing.        The defendant, of course, has no\n\ninterest in being sentenced above the maximum and no incentive to\n\nrequest that the jury specifically determine those facts which\n\nwould carry him above that level.           The government, on the other\n\nhand, does have an interest in going above the maximum, so it\n\nshould bear the burden of requesting submission of the issue to the\n\njury.      Further, a defendant will not know whether there is an\n\n\n      14\n        Apprendi was decided on June 26, 2000. We have been asked\nhere to evaluate whether there was Apprendi error in two trials,\none of which took place before Apprendi was decided and the other\nof which began after Apprendi. These cases were indicted in 1998,\nand the first trial came to verdict in October 1999. Five of the\nsix appellants convicted at this first trial were also sentenced\nbefore the Apprendi decision; Caribe, the sixth, was sentenced on\nDecember 15, 2000. Valle and Rivera were convicted at the second\ntrial, which began in September 2000, after Apprendi.\n\n                                     -63-\n\fApprendi error    until    sentencing,      and   then   only    if   the   court\n\nconsiders   a   sentence   above    the    maximum.      An     objection    from\n\ndefendant at the point of sentencing will be timely.\n\n     Rivera requested before the jury was charged that the district\n\ncourt submit the question of drug quantity and type to the jury in\n\na special verdict. Valle joined in this initial objection. Rivera\n\nrenewed his objection at sentencing, but Valle did not.                       The\n\ngovernment argues that Valle waived his Apprendi claim by failing\n\nto renew his objection after the jury was charged or at sentencing.\n\nThe district court denied Rivera and Valle's request, presumably\n\nbecause this court had not yet held that Apprendi applied to § 846\n\nprosecutions; under prior circuit law, the drug quantity and type\n\ndetermination for sentencing purposes was for the judge to decide.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Lindia, 82 F.3d 1154, 1160-61 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).   It was not until January 2, 2001, some three months after\n\nthe trial judge acted here, that this circuit decided that Apprendi\n\napplied to §§ 841 and 846.      United States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27,\n\n40-41 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n     Thus, this case may be viewed as a transition case to a new\n\npost-Apprendi    regime,   before    this    court    applied     Apprendi     to\n\nprosecutions under §§ 841 and 846.           In this transition context,\n\nwhere the defendant did raise the issue and ask for a special\n\nverdict, we have sympathy for the argument that this is enough to\n\npreserve the Apprendi objection.           Still, given Bousley v. United\n\n\n                                    -64-\n\fStates,   523     U.S.   614   (1998),   the   waiver   analysis   is   very\n\ncomplicated and we prefer to assume rather than decide that the\n\nissue was preserved in these circumstances.\n\n     b.   Valle\n\n     Valle's sentence of 360 months exceeds the default statutory\n\nmaximum for cocaine offenses of twenty years and so raises a valid\n\nclaim of Apprendi error.\n\n     The jury found Valle guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of\n\nparticipating in a drug conspiracy.        The only transaction in which\n\nValle was alleged to be a participant was the planned importation\n\nof 1,100 kilograms of cocaine in the summer of 1997.         Therefore the\n\njury must have found that Valle participated in this transaction.\n\nThe only issue is the type and amount of drugs involved in this\n\ntransaction, an issue that appears to have been undisputed at\n\ntrial. See, e.g., United States v. Swatzie, 228 F.3d 1278, 1283\n\n(11th Cir. 2000) (affirming where there was no evidentiary basis\n\nfor the jury to find that the defendant had possessed cocaine with\n\nintent to distribute but that the quantity of cocaine involved was\n\nless than five grams).\n\n     CI Hernandez testified on direct examination at the second\n\ntrial that the transaction involved 1,100 kilograms of cocaine. CI\n\nDiaz also testified that the transaction was to involve between\n\n1,000 and 1,200 kilograms of cocaine.          The drug type and quantity\n\nwas not the subject of any questions on cross-examination; indeed,\n\n\n                                    -65-\n\fdefense counsels' questions appear to take the drug type and\n\nquantity as a given.   Nor did defense counsel raise the issue in\n\nclosing arguments.   Finally, Valle does not point to any evidence\n\non appeal that would cast doubt on the alleged drug type or\n\nquantity involved in this transaction. See, e.g., United States v.\n\nMartinez-Medina, 279 F.3d 105, 122 (1st Cir. 2002) (dismissing\n\ndefendants' Apprendi claims under harmless error review in part\n\nbecause neither defendant seriously denied that the conspiracy\n\ninvolved at least five kilograms of cocaine).       We thus conclude\n\nthat the Apprendi error as to Valle was harmless.\n\n     c.   Rivera\n\n     Any Apprendi error against Rivera was also harmless.     Rivera\n\nwas sentenced to life imprisonment, while the default statutory\n\nmaximum for a defendant with a prior felony drug conviction (such\n\nas Rivera) is ten years.     The government concedes that Rivera\n\npreserved his Apprendi claim because he raised it at trial and at\n\nsentencing.   The only issue, therefore, is whether the jury must\n\nhave found Rivera guilty of conspiring to possess at least half a\n\nkilogram of cocaine with an intent to distribute.    The trial judge\n\ncan sentence a defendant with a prior felony drug conviction to\n\nlife imprisonment based on that amount of cocaine.     See 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(B).\n\n     At trial, the government produced overwhelming evidence that\n\nthe transactions in which Rivera participated involved at least\n\n\n                               -66-\n\fhalf a kilogram of cocaine.       CI Hernandez and CI Diaz testified as\n\nto the amounts involved in two planned cocaine importations of\n\n1,100    kilograms   and   700   kilograms.     Torres,   the   cooperating\n\ndefendant, testified that Rivera was involved in the successful\n\nimportation of 250 kilograms of cocaine.              Their testimony was\n\nsupported    by   evidence   from   wiretaps    and   other   surveillance.\n\nRivera's counsel did not contest the type or amount of drugs\n\ninvolved in any of these importations at trial.           Rivera argues on\n\nappeal that the jury could not have been sure of the drug type or\n\nquantity involved because these were \"dry\" conspiracies, which\n\nmeans that the government did not seize any drugs.            The amount of\n\nthe drugs was clear, nonetheless.             There is simply no serious\n\nargument that the jury could have convicted Rivera believing that\n\nhe participated in a conspiracy involving less than half a kilogram\n\nof cocaine.\n\n        Rivera also relies on our decision in Collazo-Aponte to argue\n\nthat an Apprendi error can never be harmless.          That case does not\n\nstand for this proposition.         The defendant in Collazo-Aponte did\n\nnot preserve his Apprendi error at trial, which means that this\n\ncourt normally would have reviewed his claim under plain error\n\nreview and, as part of that inquiry, examined the evidence against\n\nhim.     We did not do so, however, because the government conceded\n\nthat the error was plain.        Collazo-Aponte, 281 F.3d at 324.      Thus\n\nthere was no reason for the court to go through the plain error\n\n\n                                    -67-\n\fanalysis.     Had the government not made this concession, we would\n\nhave reviewed the evidence presented at trial to determine whether\n\nthe defendant's Apprendi claim survived plain error review.\n\n     d.   Arroyo\n\n     Arroyo's sentence of 324 months was also contrary to Apprendi\n\nbecause it exceeded the ten-year default statutory maximum for\n\nprior offenders. Arroyo did not raise an Apprendi claim before the\n\ndistrict court, and review is for plain error.      Arroyo, who was\n\nreplaced as Rivera's lieutenant when he demanded a million dollars,\n\nwas connected only to the first planned importation, involving\n\n1,100 kilograms of cocaine. The jury could have convicted him only\n\non this basis.     Arroyo did not dispute at trial the drug type or\n\namount involved in this planned importation, nor does he dispute\n\nthese facts on appeal.   Moreover, no jury could have failed to find\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy involved some amount\n\nof cocaine, triggering a maximum sentence of thirty years.       CI\n\nHernandez testified in great detail about their plans to import\n\n1,100 kilograms of cocaine, and CI Diaz testified to some of the\n\nsame facts.    There was no plain error.\n\n     e.   Caribe\n\n     We review Caribe's Apprendi claim for harmless error because\n\nhe raised the claim at sentencing.      Caribe was sentenced to 420\n\nmonths, which was above the applicable five-year statutory maximum.\n\nThis sentence would be authorized by 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B) if\n\n\n                                 -68-\n\fthe conspiracy involved at least half a kilogram of cocaine or more\n\nthan 100 kilograms of marijuana.              Caribe argues that the error was\n\nnot    harmless     because     the    evidence     linking    him    to   the   drug\n\nconspiracy was slim and relied primarily on the testimony of\n\ngovernment informants of dubious credibility. The evidence against\n\nCaribe was much stronger than his re-telling of it; but he has\n\nsimply focused on the wrong target.                The jury did convict him of\n\nconspiring to possess drugs with an intent to distribute them; the\n\nonly    remaining    issue      is    the   type   and    quantity    of   the   drugs\n\ninvolved.\n\n       The jury could not have convicted Caribe without finding that\n\nhe was involved in the conspiracy's final planned importation.\n\nCaribe did not dispute the type or quantity of drugs involved in\n\nthat plan at trial and does not do so on appeal.                CI Diaz testified\n\nthat the importation involved 700 kilograms of drugs.                       There is\n\nless evidence about the type of drugs involved.                      Diaz testified\n\nonly that there were \"700 kilos\" involved; he never explicitly said\n\nwhat type of drugs the conspirators planned to import, although one\n\nquestion during his cross-examination referred to cocaine, and he\n\ndid not correct defense counsel.               Nonetheless, it does not matter\n\nfor Apprendi purposes what type of drug was involved.                       The only\n\ndrugs    charged     in   the    indictment        were    cocaine,    heroin,    and\n\nmarijuana. Under § 841(b)(1)(B), Caribe's sentence was permissible\n\nregardless of what type of drugs were involved, as long as the\n\n\n                                            -69-\n\fconspiracy involved at least 700 kilograms of any of these types of\n\ndrugs.\n\n     f.   Bonet\n\n     Bonet's sentence of 360 months was contrary to Apprendi\n\nbecause it exceeded the ten-year default statutory maximum for\n\nprior offenders.      His sentence would be valid under 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(D) as long as he conspired to possess with intent to\n\ndistribute any amount of cocaine or at least fifty grams of\n\nmarijuana.   He argues that we should review his claim for harmless\n\nerror because his co-defendant Nelson made an Apprendi objection.\n\nHowever, the trial judge required each defense counsel to make\n\ntheir own objections, and Bonet's counsel did not join in Nelson's\n\nApprendi objection.    We review Bonet's claim for plain error.\n\n     Like Caribe, the evidence tied Bonet to the conspiracy's final\n\nplanned importation in the fall of 1997.    The same analysis that\n\napplied to Caribe also applies to Bonet: there was overwhelming\n\nevidence of a quantity of \"700 kilos,\" and that quantity of drugs\n\nis sufficient to justify his sentence regardless of whether the\n\ntype of narcotic was cocaine, heroin, or marijuana.   See 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(B).\n\n     g.   Nelson\n\n     Nelson's sentence of 293 months raises a potential Apprendi\n\nissue because it exceeded the ten-year default statutory maximum\n\nfor prior offenders.     His sentence would be permissible if the\n\n\n                                -70-\n\fconspiracy involved at least 50 kilograms of marijuana or any\n\namount of cocaine.     See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D).      Nelson made an\n\nApprendi objection only during trial; we review his claim for\n\nharmless error.\n\n     The primary evidence against Nelson at trial concerned the\n\nplanned importations of 36 kilograms of cocaine and approximately\n\n6,000 pounds of marijuana.          The jury could not have convicted\n\nNelson without finding that he was involved in at least one of\n\nthese ventures.     The Apprendi error was harmless because evidence\n\nestablishing the amount and type of drugs involved in both of these\n\nplans was overwhelming and undisputed at trial.         CI Hernandez and\n\ncooperating   defendant    Torres    both   testified   that   Nelson   had\n\nattempted to bring 36 kilograms of cocaine into Puerto Rico. There\n\nwas some dispute as to Nelson's motivations for participating in\n\nthe transaction, but he never disputed the type or quantity of\n\ndrugs involved.     As to marijuana, the government at trial played a\n\nrecording of a conversation between Rivera and Nelson in which they\n\ndiscussed importing 6,000 pounds of marijuana.          Nelson offered no\n\nevidence to rebut this point, and at sentencing did not dispute the\n\ncontention that the plan involved 6,000 pounds of marijuana.\n\n     h.   Chevere\n\n     Chevere's sentence of 540 months raised a potential Apprendi\n\nissue because it exceeded the five-year default statutory maximum.\n\nThe sentence would be permissible under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A) as\n\n\n                                    -71-\n\flong as he was involved in a conspiracy involving at least five\n\nkilograms of cocaine or 1,000 kilograms of marijuana.                 Chevere\n\nargues that his claim should be reviewed for harmless error because\n\nhe says his counsel raised an Apprendi claim at sentencing.               The\n\ntranscript   of   his    sentencing    hearing   shows   that   his   counsel\n\nchallenged only Chevere's involvement in the conspiracy and the\n\nbase level calculation, not the amount or type of drugs.          We review\n\nhis claim for plain error.\n\n     Although there was not evidence that Chevere conspired to\n\nimport marijuana, the evidence did tie him to the successful\n\nimportation of 250 kilograms of cocaine.          Torres, the cooperating\n\ndefendant, testified that Chevere was in charge of security for\n\nthat importation.       There was no dispute about the type or quantity\n\nof drugs involved. Torres was directly involved in the importation\n\nand testified that he and the other conspirators imported 250\n\nkilograms of cocaine.        He described in detail how he and Rivera\n\nsplit the load and how Rivera planned to send his share to New York\n\nfor distribution. CI Hernandez also testified that Rivera told him\n\nthat he successfully imported 250 kilograms of cocaine into Puerto\n\nRico.\n\n     Chevere claims that the transaction never took place despite\n\nTorres and Hernandez's testimony to the contrary.          To support this\n\nclaim, he points to the fact that the FBI, which had Rivera's\n\norganization under surveillance, did not see the delivery of\n\n\n                                      -72-\n\fcocaine.    However, the jury necessarily found that the transaction\n\ndid   occur,    whether   or   not   it   was   observed    by   investigators\n\ndirectly.      There was no evidence that this importation involved a\n\nsmaller amount of cocaine.\n\n       i.   Rodriguez\n\n      Rodriguez's sentence of 151 months was contrary to Apprendi\n\nbecause it exceeded the default statutory maximum of five years.\n\nThe sentence would be permissible as long as Rodriguez participated\n\nin a conspiracy involving any amount of cocaine.                 We review his\n\nclaim for plain error because he did not raise it at trial.\n\n      The only evidence at trial relating to Rodriguez tied him to\n\nthe successful importation of 250 kilograms of cocaine.                  Taped\n\ntelephone conversations played at trial showed that Rodriguez\n\ndelivered the cocaine imported in that transaction to New York,\n\nwhere it was distributed by Figueroa, Caribe's brother-in-law. The\n\njury could not have convicted Rodriguez without believing that he\n\nwas involved in this aspect of the conspiracy.             The amount and type\n\nof drugs in the successful importation were undisputed at trial,\n\nand thus we reject Rodriguez's Apprendi claim.\n\nI.    Substantial Assistance Departure (Romero)\n\n      Romero pled guilty and presents one issue, a sentencing issue,\n\non his appeal.       He argues that the sole reason the government\n\nfailed to move that he be given a Section 5K1.1 sentence reduction\n\nfor substantial assistance was an impermissible one: it was in\n\n\n                                     -73-\n\fretaliation for his telling the truth in his third debriefing, a\n\ntruth which was exculpatory as to codefendant Ortiz.\n\n      U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1 provides: \"Upon motion of the government\n\nstating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in\n\nthe   investigation    or   prosecution       of    another      person    who   has\n\ncommitted an offense, the court may depart from the guidelines.\"\n\nSee also 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) (\"Upon motion of the Government, the\n\ncourt shall have the authority to impose a sentence below a level\n\nestablished by statute as minimum sentence so as to reflect a\n\ndefendant's      substantial     assistance        in   the    investigation      or\n\nprosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\").\n\nRomero's plea agreement stated that \"[t]he United States reserves\n\nits option to seek any departure from the applicable sentencing\n\nguidelines, pursuant to Section 5K1.1 . . . if in its discretion\n\nthe United States determines that such a departure is appropriate.\"\n\nThe agreement further specified that \"[t]he defendant agrees that\n\nthe   decision    whether   to   file   such   motion         rests   in   the   sole\n\ndiscretion of the United States.\"\n\n      The district court, after hearing proffers from both counsel,\n\nrejected the argument and declined to take testimony from Agent\n\nPlichta, who conducted the debriefings at issue here.                        Romero\n\nargued that there was error in not holding an evidentiary hearing\n\nand in not compelling the government to file such a motion.\n\n      Our review of questions of law is de novo; our review of the\n\n\n                                     -74-\n\ffact-based conclusion of the district court as to the substantial\n\nassistance question is for clear error.                 See United States v. Doe,\n\n233 F.3d 642, 643-44 (1st Cir 2000).\n\n      Implicit    in    the   question      presented        is    an    issue   of   law:\n\nassuming Romero's claims were true, whether it is permissible for\n\nthe   government       to   decline   to    seek    a       substantial      assistance\n\ndeparture in retaliation for a cooperating defendant's truthful\n\ndisclosure of exculpatory information about codefendants.                          In this\n\narea, the government acts under two constraints. First, the law is\n\nclear   that   the     government     may    not    base      its       decision    on   an\n\nunconstitutional motive, such as racial prejudice.                          See Wade v.\n\nUnited States, 504 U.S. 181, 185-86 (1992).                       Second, because the\n\ngovernment entered into a plea agreement with Romero, it had to\n\ncarry out in good faith the obligations it assumed under the\n\nagreement. See United States v. Alegria, 192 F.3d 179, 186-87 (1st\n\nCir. 1999); see also United States v. Davis, 247 F.3d 322, 325 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).      This good-faith requirement applies even though the\n\nplea agreement specifies that the \"government retains absolute\n\ndiscretion with respect to the filing of a section 5K1.1 motion.\"\n\nAlegria, 192 F.3d at 186-87.\n\n      Whether viewed as part of the Wade obligation or the Alegria\n\nobligation, the government may not base its refusal to seek a\n\nsubstantial      assistance     departure      on       a    defendant's         truthful\n\ndisclosure of exculpatory information.              We can think of few things\n\n\n                                       -75-\n\fmore corrosive to the criminal justice system than prosecutorial\n\nretaliation against a witness for telling the truth. If these were\n\nthe government's grounds, they would both be impermissible and have\n\nno rational relationship to a legitimate government end.                 Cf.\n\nDavis, 247 F.3d at 326.\n\n     The district court held that Romero had not made a threshold\n\nshowing of improper motivation by the government. See Alegria, 192\n\nF.3d at 187.    In explaining to the district court its reasons for\n\nnot filing a Section 5K1.1 motion, the government used language\n\nthat was likely to arouse suspicion.        It complained that, because\n\nof Romero's statements and writings produced at the third of his\n\nfour debriefings, the prosecution was forced to provide defense\n\ncounsel with Brady and Jencks material. Appropriately concerned by\n\nthese statements, the district judge investigated further and took\n\nproffers from both counsel.\n\n     In   the   end,   the   district   court   was   satisfied   that   the\n\ngovernment had reason to think Romero was not truthful at the last\n\ntwo debriefings and, while he had given assistance, he had not\n\ngiven substantial assistance. Romero's untruthfulness was shown by\n\nthe fact that he did not disclose certain information helpful to\n\nOrtiz and Nelson until his third debriefing, and that this newly-\n\ndisclosed information appeared to be inconsistent with information\n\nprovided by another cooperating witness. As the trial judge noted,\n\nthe government had told the court it intended to use Romero as a\n\n\n                                   -76-\n\fprosecution witness at trial but then did not do so.        This decision\n\nnot to call Romero as a witness was entirely consistent with the\n\ngovernment's view, expressed at sentencing, that Romero was not\n\ntruthful.    And, as the district court aptly noted, substantial\n\nassistance is a higher standard for a defendant to meet than mere\n\ncooperation.      Romero's   failure   to   be   forthcoming    in   earlier\n\ndebriefings evidenced his failure to meet this higher standard.\n\n       When faced with such Section 5K1.1 claims where there is a\n\nplea   agreement,   the   government     bears   the   modest   burden    of\n\nproduction, not persuasion.        Alegria, 192 F.3d at 187.             The\n\ngovernment must offer \"facially adequate reasons.\" Id. at 188. It\n\ndid so here.      The judge, who sat through a lengthy trial and\n\ninquired into this matter, found nothing impermissible about the\n\ngovernment's reasons for declining to seek a substantial assistance\n\ndeparture.     Given the judge's extensive exploration of the issue\n\nwith counsel, no separate evidentiary hearing was required.\n\nJ.   Supervised Release Terms (Bonet and Rodriguez)\n\n       Bonet and Rodriguez challenge the length of their terms of\n\nsupervised release.    The district judge sentenced Bonet to twenty\n\nyears of supervised release and Rodriguez to fifteen years.            Both\n\ndefendants claim that these terms were invalid because they were\n\ndisproportionately longer as a percentage of their total years of\n\nimprisonment than their codefendants' terms.            This argument is\n\nforeclosed by 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a), which establishes the limited\n\n\n                                  -77-\n\fcircumstances in which a defendant can seek review of his sentence.\n\nAs the Seventh Circuit held in United States v. Rios-Calderon, 80\n\nF.3d 194, 198 (7th Cir. 1996), \"nothing in § 3742(a) allows review\n\nof a sentence imposed in conformity with the Guidelines on the\n\nground that a codefendant was treated differently.\"                  See also\n\nUnited States v. Youngpeter, 986 F.2d 349, 356 (10th Cir. 1993)\n\n(\"Sentencing differences due to individual conduct as considered by\n\nthe      Sentencing   Guidelines       does      not    make     a   sentence\n\ndisproportionate.\").\n\n       Rodriguez also argues that his supervised release term is\n\nbarred by U.S.S.G. § 5D1.2.         We note at the outset that this claim\n\nwas nearly forfeited because of the skeletal manner in which it was\n\nraised.     See Mass. Sch. of Law v. Am. Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 43\n\n(1st   Cir.   1998)   (claim   is    forfeited    if   it   is   raised   in   a\n\nperfunctory manner unaccompanied by developed argumentation).              But\n\nwe will give Rodriguez the benefit of the doubt and find that the\n\nclaim was not forfeited. Rodriguez's counsel also failed to object\n\nto the length of the supervised release term at sentencing, which\n\nwould normally mean that his claim could be reviewed only for plain\n\nerror.    But we will again give Rodriguez the benefit of the doubt\n\nbecause he was not given advance notice in the presentence report\n\nor by the judge or prosecutor that he could be sentenced to more\n\nthan five years of supervised release, the maximum term specified\n\nin the guidelines.\n\n\n                                      -78-\n\f     We now turn to the merits of Rodriguez's claim.      U.S.S.G. §\n\n5D1.2 states that supervised release terms for Class A or B\n\nfelonies shall be \"at least three years but not more than five\n\nyears.\"   The relevant statute, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), provides\n\nthat the defendant shall be sentenced to a term of supervised\n\nrelease of \"at least five years.\"   This court's recent decision in\n\nUnited States v. Cortes-Claudio held that these provisions should\n\nbe read together to mean that a defendant convicted under 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(A) can be sentenced to only five years of supervised\n\nrelease unless the judge makes a permissible upward departure from\n\nthe guidelines.   312 F.3d 17, 18-19 (1st Cir. 2002).   The judge can\n\nmake such a departure if he finds that there are aggravating\n\ncircumstances \"of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into\n\nconsideration by the Sentencing Commission,\" and if the parties are\n\ngiven advance notice that the judge is contemplating making such a\n\ndeparture and of the grounds on which the judge is contemplating\n\ndeparting.   Id. at 24; see also United States v. Burns, 501 U.S.\n\n129, 138-39 (1991).\n\n     The district judge in this case did not anticipate this\n\ncourt's decision in Cortes-Claudio and mistakenly concluded that\n\nthe guidelines did not apply to the length of a supervised release\n\nterm imposed under 21 U.S.C. § 841.      Thus he did not give the\n\nparties notice of a possible upward departure or make the required\n\nfindings of aggravating circumstances to support the departure. We\n\n\n                                -79-\n\faccordingly vacate Rodriguez's fifteen-year supervised release term\n\nand remand to the district court for re-sentencing as to the length\n\nof the term of supervised release.                On remand, should the district\n\ncourt find that there are aggravating circumstances of a kind, or\n\nto   a        degree,   not   adequately    taken   into   consideration   by   the\n\nSentencing Commission, it must still give the parties advance\n\nnotice that it is contemplating departing and the grounds of the\n\npossible departure and give them an opportunity to respond.\n\nK.   Other Sentencing Guidelines Issues\n\n         1. Drug quantities (Caribe, Bonet, Valle, Chevere, Arroyo,\n            Nelson, Rodriguez)\n\n\n         In sentencing, the district court took into account the amount\n\nof drugs that could be attributed to each defendant.                       Several\n\ndefendants challenge these determinations, which are distinct from\n\nclaims that the determination of quantity by the judge rather than\n\nthe jury violated Apprendi.15              We review the trial court's factual\n\ndeterminations at sentencing for clear error. United States v.\n\nDamon, 127 F.3d 139, 141 (1st Cir. 1997). Legal interpretations of\n\nthe sentencing guidelines are reviewed de novo. United States v.\n\n\n\n         15\n         As we noted above, Apprendi only requires the jury to\ndetermine the drug type and quantity involved in the conspiracy.\nAfter the jury has made this determination, the judge can make\nindividualized   determinations  about   the   amount  of   drugs\nattributable to each defendant. Even though the jury did not make\nits initial determination, we found no reversible error as to any\ndefendant, so that the judge could still determine the amount of\ndrug attributable to each defendant.\n\n                                           -80-\n\fRanney, 298 F.3d 74, 80 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n      a.   Caribe\n\n      Caribe argues that the court erred in setting his base offense\n\nlevel at 38, which is applicable to a quantity of 150 kilograms or\n\nmore of cocaine.         The court set the base offense level after\n\ndetermining that 745 kilograms of cocaine could be attributed to\n\nCaribe.    The court held that Caribe was directly involved in the\n\nconspiracy to import 700 kilograms of cocaine in the fall of 1997.\n\nThis determination was consistent with the testimony of CI Diaz,\n\nwho testified that Caribe was a key player in several meetings to\n\nplan the details of this importation. It also attributed to Caribe\n\n45   kilograms     of   cocaine   out    of    the   successful    250   kilogram\n\nimportation, which he sent to his brother-in-law in New York for\n\ndistribution.       Torres had testified that Caribe was in charge of\n\nmoving some amount of cocaine up to New York, and that he believed\n\nthe amount to be \"about forty-five\" kilograms.               It was not clear\n\nerror for the court to conclude that Caribe was responsible, at\n\nleast in part, for distributing 45 kilograms of cocaine.                     This\n\ntotal quantity of 745 kilograms of cocaine supports the court's\n\ndecision to set Caribe's base offense level at 38.\n\n      b.   Bonet\n\n      The court found Bonet responsible for at least 150 kilograms\n\nof   cocaine,    based    on   Bonet's        involvement   with   the   planned\n\nimportation of 700 kilograms of cocaine.               This determination was\n\n\n                                        -81-\n\fnot   clear    error   considering       Bonet's    role    in     planning     this\n\nimportation.\n\n      Bonet argues that the court should have reduced the amount of\n\ncocaine attributed to the defendants because of the intensive\n\ninvolvement of CIS Hernandez and Diaz in the conspiracy.                    This is\n\na type of improper sentencing factor manipulation argument, for\n\nwhich Bonet has the burden.        As stated in United States v. Montoya,\n\n\"garden variety manipulation claims are largely a waste of time.\"\n\n62 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995).         It is insufficient to say that the\n\nidea of the conspiracy originated with undercover agents, or that\n\nconduct was     encouraged    by   the    government,      or     that    the   crime\n\nexceeded in degree or kind what the defendant had done before.\n\nInstead the defendant must show that elements like these were so\n\nextensive     that   \"the   government's     conduct       must    be     viewed   as\n\nextraordinary misconduct.\"          Id. (internal quotations omitted).\n\nThis standard is high in part because the defendant has the\n\nopportunity to raise an entrapment defense at trial.\n\n      Bonet has fallen far short of this standard; he offers nothing\n\nmore than conclusory allegations. Furthermore, Hernandez testified\n\nthat the Colombians, not he or Diaz, set the amount involved in the\n\ncocaine     importations.       For      example,    in     the     700    kilogram\n\nimportation, Hernandez testified that the Colombians wanted the\n\norganization to import 700 kilograms of cocaine as a test to\n\ndetermine whether its members had the capability to import larger\n\n\n                                      -82-\n\fquantities of drugs in the future.    Bonet also bragged to Diaz that\n\nhe and his team had been drug trafficking for years.           It is\n\nunlikely, therefore, that government agents encouraged Bonet or his\n\ncoconspirators to engage in conduct in which they would otherwise\n\nhave been unwilling to participate.\n\n     c.   Valle\n\n     Valle argues that the judge erred in attributing at least 150\n\nkilograms of cocaine to him.      He did not raise this claim at\n\nsentencing, and therefore it is waived. United States v. Shattuck,\n\n961 F.2d 1012, 1015 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"We do not review sentencing\n\nguideline disputes which were not preserved before the district\n\ncourt.\"). We have discretion to review waived guidelines claims in\n\n\"horrendous cases where a gross miscarriage of justice would\n\noccur.\"   United States v. Haggert, 980 F.2d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nThis is not one of those cases.   The evidence overwhelmingly tied\n\nValle to the planned importation of 1,100 kilograms of drugs.     CI\n\nHernandez testified extensively about Valle's involvement in this\n\ntransaction and the amount and type of drugs involved.\n\n     d.   Chevere\n\n     Chevere argues that the district court erred in finding that\n\nhe was involved in the importation of 250 kilograms of cocaine.\n\nTorres testified that Chevere was in charge of security for this\n\nsuccessful transaction.    Chevere argues that the district court\n\nshould not have used this transaction to set Chevere's base offense\n\n\n                               -83-\n\flevel, because an FBI agent who was watching the delivery location\n\ntestified that he did not actually see the drugs being delivered.\n\nWhether the FBI agent saw it or not, there was ample additional\n\nevidence at trial that the transaction took place, and that Chevere\n\nwas involved in it.   There was no clear error.\n\n      e.   Arroyo\n\n      Arroyo argues error in the attribution of 1,200 kilograms of\n\ncocaine to him because the government did not show that he had the\n\ncapability to transport such a large amount of cocaine.     Arroyo\n\nargues that the government never proved that Arroyo owned a boat\n\nthat could be used to bring the cocaine to Puerto Rico.   Under the\n\nsentencing guidelines, if a planned drug transaction does not take\n\nplace, the sentencing court should base the defendant's drug-\n\nquantity finding on the negotiated amount of drugs, in this case\n\n1,200 kilograms. See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1, cmt. n.12.     However, the\n\ncourt can use a lower amount if \"the defendant establishes that he\n\nor she did not intend to provide, or was not reasonably capable of\n\nproviding, the agreed-upon quantity of the controlled substance.\"\n\nId.   Thus the burden is on Arroyo to show that he was not capable\n\nof transporting 1,200 kilograms of cocaine. Arroyo has not met his\n\nburden in this case and there was no clear error.\n\n      f.   Nelson\n\n      Nelson argues that the district court erred in attributing\n\n99.5 kilograms of cocaine to him.     The court found that he was\n\n\n                               -84-\n\finvolved in the successful importation of 250 kilograms of cocaine\n\nand had a role in distributing 50 kilograms from that shipment.\n\nTorres testified that Rivera gave Nelson some unknown percentage of\n\nRivera's own share of the cocaine from this shipment.                Rivera also\n\ngave a percentage of his share to Caribe and to Chevere, but Torres\n\ndid   not   know    exactly   how   much   each   of   the   three   defendants\n\nreceived; he only knew that together they received 50 kilograms.\n\nNelson and Rivera, in recorded conversations, discussed the price\n\nat which they would be able to sell the cocaine.                The court also\n\nfound that he had a role in the attempted importation of 36\n\nkilograms of cocaine and the transaction involving 6,000 pounds of\n\nmarijuana.      It also could have based its overall findings on\n\nNelson's more general involvement in distributing Rivera's share of\n\nthe cocaine.       We see no clear error in the court's conclusion.\n\n      g.    Rodriguez\n\n      Rodriguez argues that the district court erred in determining\n\nthat his base offense level was 34, which is applicable when the\n\njudge attributes at least 15 kilograms of cocaine to the defendant.\n\nThe government alleged that Rodriguez was involved in delivering to\n\nFigueroa in New York approximately 45 kilograms of cocaine from the\n\n250   kilogram      shipment.        The    government       introduced   taped\n\nconversations in which Rivera told Figueroa that he had arranged\n\nfor someone to deliver the cocaine to Figueroa.                The day before,\n\nRodriguez had flown to New York from San Juan.           The government also\n\n\n                                     -85-\n\fintroduced a recording of a conversation in which Rodriguez and\n\nRivera discussed     the    price   of   cocaine.       At   trial,    Rodriguez\n\ndisputed that he had been involved in the cocaine delivery, but the\n\njury could not have convicted Rodriguez otherwise.                     The only\n\nremaining issue is the amount of drugs that Rodriguez brought to\n\nNew York; Torres testified that Rivera sent \"about 45\" kilograms\n\nthere.     It was not clear error for the judge to attribute at least\n\nfifteen of those kilograms of cocaine to Rodriguez.\n\n      2.    Minor Participant Adjustment (Bonet)\n\n      Bonet argues that the court erred in not granting him a two-\n\nlevel reduction     under   U.S.S.G.     §   3B1.2(b)    for   being    a   minor\n\nparticipant in the conspiracy.           The commentary to this section\n\nstates that \"a minor participant means any participant who is less\n\ncapable than most other participants, but whose role could not be\n\ndescribed as minimal.\"       U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2(b) cmt. n.5.            In seeking\n\na § 3B1.2 adjustment, a defendant \"has the burden of proving that\n\nhe is both less culpable than most others involved in the offense\n\nof   conviction   and   less   culpable      than   most     other    miscreants\n\nconvicted of comparable crimes.\"         United States v. Ortiz-Santiago,\n\n211 F.3d 146, 149 (1st Cir. 2000).              The court did not err in\n\nrefusing to grant this adjustment.           The testimony at trial showed\n\nthat Bonet participated in several of the meetings in which the\n\nconspirators planned the importation of 700 kilograms of cocaine.\n\nBonet was also responsible for testing the radio equipment that\n\n\n                                    -86-\n\fwould be used.   Finally, Bonet told CI Diaz that he had been part\n\nof Rivera's drug trafficking team for many years.    It was entirely\n\nreasonable to conclude that Bonet was no minor participant.\n\n     3.   Special Skills Enhancements (Valle and Bonet)\n\n     Section 3B1.3 of the sentencing guidelines provides that the\n\ndistrict court can increase the offense level two levels if the\n\ndefendant \"used a special skill, in a manner that significantly\n\nfacilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.\"       The\n\ncommentary to this section states, \"'Special skill' refers to a\n\nskill not possessed by members of the general public and usually\n\nrequiring substantial education, training or licensing. Examples\n\nwould include pilots, lawyers, doctors, accountants, chemists, and\n\ndemolition experts.\"    U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3 cmt. n.3.     We review the\n\ndistrict court's legal interpretation of the term \"special skill\"\n\nde novo and its factual application for clear error. United States\n\nv. Noah, 130 F.3d 490, 499 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n     The district court increased Valle's offense level by two\n\nlevels because it found that Valle was going to be the boat captain\n\nfor the first planned importation of 1,100 kilograms of cocaine,\n\nthus exercising a special skill.        Valle did not object to this\n\nenhancement at his sentencing hearing, and therefore he waived the\n\nclaim.    Haggert, 980 F.2d at 10-11.    Even if this claim were not\n\nwaived, the record amply supports the determination.\n\n     The district court enhanced Bonet's offense level by two\n\n\n                                -87-\n\flevels because it found that his coconspirators were \"counting on\n\nhis skills as a person knowledgeable with communication equipment.\"\n\n The record establishes that Bonet had a special skill.                   CI Diaz\n\ntestified that on October 30, 1997, Bonet conducted a test of the\n\n20/40    radio   that    the   conspirators       were   planning    to   use   to\n\ncommunicate with the Colombians in order to complete the planned\n\nimportation of 700 kilograms of cocaine.            A 20/40 radio is one that\n\ncan be used to communicate with any part of the world.                      Bonet\n\nshowed Diaz the antenna he had put on a tree outside his house.\n\nBonet then set up the radio and tried to contact the Colombians;\n\nunbeknownst to him, the transmission was intercepted by the FBI.\n\nBonet conducted the test over high and low frequency channels and\n\nhad given the Colombians the same list of frequencies so that the\n\ntwo groups could communicate.         This evidence shows that Bonet had\n\na special skill within the meaning of § 3B1.3.                    Accord United\n\nStates v. Malgoza, 2 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir. 1993) (term\n\n\"special skills\" applies to an \"advanced level of radio operating\n\nability\").\n\n     A   defendant      does   not   need    to   have   formal   education     or\n\nprofessional stature to have a special skill within the meaning of\n\n§ 3B1.3.    Noah, 130 F.3d at 500.          Instead \"a special skill can be\n\nderived from experience or from self-tutelage.\"             Id.     Nonetheless,\n\nthe defendant must possess skills that members of the general\n\npublic would not have.         Bonet's knowledge was more extensive than\n\n\n                                      -88-\n\fmerely turning on a radio and speaking; he also knew how to\n\nassemble the radio and its antenna and understood how to determine\n\nand locate the frequencies necessary to communicate with the\n\nColombians.\n\n     The   issue    remains      whether      Bonet's    skill   \"significantly\n\nfacilitated the commission . . . of the offense.\"                       U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3B1.3.      Diaz did not testify that Bonet would be the person\n\noperating the radios on the day the shipment was delivered.                    Two\n\nreasonable inferences support a determination that Bonet's special\n\nskill substantially facilitated commission of the crime. We review\n\nboth possible determinations for clear error.\n\n     First,    Bonet's      radio   test      in   and   of   itself   aided   the\n\nconspiracy.     He was responsible for making sure that Rivera's\n\norganization had the necessary radio equipment to handle such a\n\nlarge importation of drugs. The Colombians would not be willing to\n\nentrust Rivera's organization with the shipment if it could not\n\nmake this showing.         Even though Bonet was unable to contact the\n\nColombians during his radio test, it did show Diaz (who, as an\n\nintermediary,      acted    as   the   Colombians'       representative)       that\n\nRivera's organization had at least some of the necessary equipment\n\nand skills.\n\n     Second, an inference that Bonet would be the one operating the\n\nradios the day of the shipment could not be clear error.                   Bonet\n\nplayed an integral part in the meetings.             He told Diaz that he was\n\n\n                                       -89-\n\fskilled as a boat captain, but that he would not be the boat\n\ncaptain for this shipment.        Bonet argues that he never got a chance\n\nto use his special skills to the full extent contemplated by his\n\nconspirators.       However, U.S.S.G. § 2X1.1(a) also covers intended\n\noffense     conduct    that    can   be   established      with   \"reasonable\n\ncertainty.\"     It was not clear error to conclude with reasonable\n\ncertainty    that     Bonet   intended    to   use   his   special   skill   to\n\nfacilitate the crime.         See United States v. Downing, 297 F.3d 52,\n\n65 (2d Cir. 2002).\n\n     4.    Firearm Enhancement (Caribe)\n\n     The district court increased Caribe's offense level by two\n\nlevels because the court determined that Rivera had a weapon in\n\nCaribe's presence during part of the planning of the 700 kilogram\n\nimportation.     U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1) provides that the judge can\n\nincrease the offense level by two levels \"if a dangerous weapon\n\n(including a firearm) was possessed.\"          The comment to this section\n\nstates that the enhancement applies if a weapon was present, unless\n\nit is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the\n\noffense.     See U.S.S.G. §     2D1.1(b)(1), cmt. n.3.\n\n     The judge found that Caribe was present when Rivera gave CI\n\nDiaz a gun to give to CI Hernandez.            Diaz testified that he met\n\nwith Caribe and Rivera on August 16, 1997.                 At the end of the\n\nmeeting, Rivera gave Diaz a gun that he asked Diaz to give to\n\nHernandez.    Rivera told Diaz that Hernandez could use the gun if he\n\n\n                                     -90-\n\fhad to because it was \"clean.\"            Caribe claims that he left the\n\nmeeting before Rivera gave Diaz the gun, but this claim is not\n\nsupported by the record.       Caribe was the last person to arrive at\n\nthe meeting, but Rivera gave Diaz the gun at the end of the meeting\n\nas they were saying good-bye.      It was not clear error for the judge\n\nto determine that Caribe remained at the meeting at this point.\n\n        Caribe next argues that the government did not establish the\n\nrequired nexus between the gun and the conspiracy. The prosecution\n\nmust show that the defendant (or in a conspiracy case, one of his\n\ncoconspirators) possessed a weapon during the offense.                United\n\nStates v. McDonald, 121 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1997); United States\n\nv. Thornton, 306 F.3d 1355, 1358 (3rd Cir. 2002).           The prosecution\n\ndoes not have to show that the defendant or his coconspirators\n\nactually used the gun in perpetrating the offense or intended to do\n\nso.   McDonald, 121 F.3d at 10.        Once the prosecution has made this\n\nshowing, the burden shifts to the defendant to establish that a\n\nconnection between the weapon and the crime was clearly improbable.\n\nId.     Caribe argues that the prosecution did not make its required\n\nshowing because it relied on the uncorroborated testimony of CI\n\nDiaz.    It is routine, and certainly not clear error, for the trial\n\njudge    to   credit   a   witness's    testimony   in   making   sentencing\n\ndeterminations, even if the testimony is not corroborated by other\n\nevidence.      Nor did the judge err in determining that Caribe's\n\ncoconspirator possessed the gun in connection with the conspiracy.\n\n\n                                       -91-\n\f     5.    Leadership Enhancement (Caribe)\n\n     Caribe next argues that the court erred in increasing his\n\noffense level by three levels after determining that Caribe was a\n\nmanager or supervisor in the organization.                 Section 3B1.1(b)\n\npermits the court to enhance the sentence if \"the defendant was\n\nmanager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the\n\ncriminal    activity   involved   five    or   more    participants   or   was\n\notherwise extensive.\"      The court based its determination on CI\n\nDiaz's testimony about Caribe's role in planning the importation of\n\n700 kilograms of cocaine in the fall of 1997.             For example, Diaz\n\ntestified that Caribe \"controlled all of the beaches and the group\n\nfrom Humacao, including the captain and the boats.\"             Caribe also\n\ntold Diaz that Ortiz, who was supposed to captain the boat that\n\nwould bring the drugs into Puerto Rico, worked for him.           According\n\nto Diaz, Caribe said that \"they [Rivera and Caribe] had the\n\ncaptains, the boats, and the personnel that was needed to carry out\n\nthe job.\"     This evidence is sufficient to support the court's\n\ndetermination.\n\n     6.    Downward Departure Requests (Valle and Nelson)\n\n     The district court denied motions by Valle and Nelson for\n\ndownward departures in their sentences.               Valle argues that the\n\ndistrict judge abused his discretion by failing to depart from the\n\nsentencing guidelines because of a claimed disparity between his\n\nsentence and the sentence of some of his coconspirators.                   The\n\n\n                                   -92-\n\fargument       fails;    a    court    cannot       depart      from    the        sentencing\n\nguidelines in order to correct a disparity between the sentences of\n\ncoconspirators. See United States v. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d 146,\n\n150     (1st     Cir.        2000)    (\"Disparity          in    sentencing           amongst\n\ncoconspirators, without more, is not enough to justify a downward\n\ndeparture.\").16 Nelson argues for a downward departure based on his\n\nnecessity defense that he participated in the conspiracy only to\n\nsave    his    kidnapped      nephew.        This    was    committed        to     the   non-\n\nreviewable discretion of the district court.                     See United States v.\n\nRomero, 32 F.3d 641, 653 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\nL.     Procedural Errors at Sentencing (Caribe)\n\n       1.     Right to Speedy Sentencing\n\n       Caribe claims that his right to a fair trial was violated\n\nbecause of excessive delay in his sentencing. Caribe was convicted\n\non     October    1,     1999.        All    objections         to     the     Presentence\n\nInvestigation Report were submitted by April 25, 2000, but he was\n\nnot sentenced until December 15, 2000.                 Thus, over fourteen months\n\npassed between the date of conviction and the date of sentencing.\n\n        The    Sixth     Amendment      provides      that      \"[i]n        all     criminal\n\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and\n\npublic trial.\"          U.S. Const. amend. VI.          The Supreme Court has not\n\n\n\n       16\n        It is far from clear that there was any disparity. Valle's\nsentence of 360 months was greater than four coconspirators'\nsentences and equal to or less than four other coconspirators'\nsentences.\n\n                                            -93-\n\fdefinitively held that this right extends to the sentencing phase.\n\nSee Pollard v. United States, 352 U.S. 354, 361 (1957) (assuming\n\nwithout deciding that the sentence is part of the trial for\n\npurposes of the Sixth Amendment). However, most circuits that have\n\naddressed this issue have held that the right to a speedy trial\n\nextends to this phase.   See, e.g., United States v. Yelverton, 197\n\nF.3d 531, 535-39 (D.C. Cir. 1999); Burkett v. Cunningham, 826 F.2d\n\n1208, 1220 (3d Cir. 1987); United States v. Reese, 568 F.2d 1246,\n\n1252-53 (6th Cir. 1977).   Several other circuits, including this\n\none, have assumed without deciding that the right extends to\n\nsentencing.   See, e.g., Katz v. King, 627 F.2d 568, 576 (1st Cir.\n\n1980); United States v. Rothrock, 20 F.3d 709, 711 (7th Cir. 1994).\n\nNo circuit has held that the right to a speedy trial does not apply\n\nat this phase.17\n\n     We assume for the purposes of this appeal that the right to a\n\nspeedy trial extends to sentencing.      We analyze the defendant's\n\nclaim under the four factors that the Supreme Court set out in\n\nBarker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530 (1972):       the length of the\n\ndelay; the reason for the delay; the defendant's assertion of his\n\nright; and prejudice to the defendant.    None of these factors is a\n\nnecessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation\n\n\n     17\n         A judge is also required under Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(a) to\nsentence a defendant \"without unnecessary delay.\" Caribe has not\nargued that the delay in his case violated this rule, and therefore\nwe do not address whether he would have a possible claim\nthereunder.\n\n                                -94-\n\fof the right to a speedy sentencing.    See id. at 533.\n\n     Applying these factors to the case at hand, we conclude that\n\nany right to speedy sentencing was not violated.        A fourteen-month\n\ndelay between the date of conviction and the date of sentencing is\n\nlong enough to trigger an inquiry into the other Barker factors.\n\nSee Perez v. Sullivan, 793 F.2d 249, 254 (10th Cir. 1986) (finding\n\na fifteen-month delay long enough to provoke an inquiry into the\n\nremaining three factors); see also Barker, 407 U.S. at 530 (\"Until\n\nthere is some delay which is presumptively prejudicial, there is no\n\nnecessity for inquiry into the other factors that go into the\n\nbalance\"); Katz, 627 F.2d at 577 (finding that a four-month delay\n\nis   \"not   unreasonable   and   certainly   not   of    constitutional\n\ndimensions\").\n\n     Caribe does not make a persuasive showing on any of the other\n\nfactors.    It took approximately seven months for the probation\n\nofficer to complete the presentence report and for the parties to\n\nsubmit their objections.    This time was not excessive given the\n\nlength of the trial, the number of defendants, and the complexity\n\nof the evidence, and indeed Caribe has not challenged this portion\n\nof the delay.     Much of the later delay can be attributed to\n\nCaribe's own motions.   He filed a series of motions to continue his\n\nsentencing: the first such motions were filed on December 17, 1999\n\nand February 1, 2000 and were denied on January 13, 2000 and\n\nFebruary 4, 2000, respectively; the court acceded to later requests\n\n\n                                 -95-\n\ffrom Caribe's counsel to postpone the sentencing, which had been\n\nscheduled for February 25, 2000; the court eventually denied\n\nCaribe's December 6, 2000 motion to continue his sentencing on\n\nDecember 13, 2000 and sentenced Caribe on December 15, 2000.\n\nCaribe also filed a motion for a new trial, which the court denied\n\non December 15, 2000.\n\n     Finally,    and   most    importantly,     Caribe    has    not   shown   he\n\nsuffered any prejudice as a result of the fourteen-month delay. The\n\nprejudice resulting from a delay between indictment and trial is\n\nobvious: the accused must live with the anxiety and concern of\n\nfacing trial; he may have to spend an extended length of time in\n\ncustody; and his defense may be impaired if witnesses' memories\n\nfade.   However, \"[m]ost of those interests diminish or disappear\n\naltogether once there has been a conviction.\"             Perez, 793 F.2d at\n\n256. Thus, the courts have great reluctance to find a speedy trial\n\ndeprivation   where    there    is   no     substantial    and    demonstrable\n\nprejudice.      Id.    Caribe argues that the delay made it more\n\ndifficult for him to challenge the contested factual allegations in\n\nthe presentence report, but he does not explain which allegations\n\nor how he was prejudiced.       He also claims that the delay gave the\n\ngovernment more time to persuade the probation officer to include\n\nunwarranted   enhancements      in   the    presentence     report,     but    as\n\ndiscussed below, Caribe was not prejudiced by these communications.\n\nCaribe may have been anxious about the length of the sentence the\n\n\n                                     -96-\n\fjudge would impose, but such anxiety is present in every sentencing\n\nand cannot be sufficient to meet the prejudice requirement.\n\n     2.   Ex Parte Communications Between Prosecution and Probation\n          Officer\n\n     Caribe also argues that the prosecution violated Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 32(b)(6)(B) by having ex parte communications with the probation\n\nofficer who wrote the presentence report.       Caribe apparently wants\n\nthis court to eliminate the two enhancements added to his offense\n\nlevel and remand the case to the district judge for re-sentencing.\n\nRule 32(b)(6)(B) provides:\n\n     Within 14 days after receiving the presentence report, the\n     parties shall communicate in writing to the probation officer,\n     and to each other, any objections to any material information,\n     sentencing classifications, sentencing guideline ranges, and\n     policy statements contained in or omitted from the presentence\n     report. After receiving objections, the probation officer may\n     meet with the defendant, the defendant's counsel, and the\n     attorney for the Government to discuss those objections. The\n     probation officer may also conduct a further investigation and\n     revise the presentence report as appropriate.\n\n\nThe probation officer issued her initial presentence report to both\n\nparties on February 3, 2000.       This report did not recommend an\n\nenhancement for Caribe's leadership role in the conspiracy or\n\npossession of a gun during the conspiracy.         Caribe alleges that\n\nAgent Plichta then met with the probation officer and reviewed the\n\nevidence about Caribe's role in the conspiracy.            The probation\n\nofficer   then   amended   her   report   to   recommend   a   four-level\n\nenhancement for a leadership role and a two-level enhancement for\n\nfirearm possession.    Caribe's counsel was not given a chance to\n\n                                  -97-\n\frebut Agent Plichta's statements before the amended report was\n\nreleased, although he was able to file formal objections pursuant\n\nto Rule 32 and to raise his objections directly to the district\n\ncourt during     the    sentencing    hearing.      Caribe    filed    a    motion\n\nobjecting to the ex parte communications and demanding disclosure\n\nof all documents that the probation officer used in preparing the\n\npresentence report.       The defendant also asked to be able to call\n\nthe probation officer as a witness at the sentencing hearing to\n\nexamine the extent of the communications.\n\n     In a published opinion, United States v. Caribe Garcia, 125 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 19 (D.P.R. 2000), the district judge denied the motion.\n\nThe court held that there was no prosecutorial misconduct because\n\n\"disclosing     information      to   the    probation   officer      [is]       the\n\nfunctional    equivalent    of   disclosing      information    to    the    court\n\nitself.\"     Id. at 21.    The court also stated that Caribe failed to\n\nshow that he was entitled to a downward departure given that the\n\npresentence    report     only   recommends    a   sentence    and    the    final\n\nsentencing determination is made \"after the Court hears arguments\n\nand objections to the presentence report in open court.\"                   Id.   We\n\nagree with the second basis for the court's opinion but not the\n\nfirst.\n\n     The first issue is difficult because of the discrepancy\n\nbetween the fairly formal procedure contemplated by Rule 32 and the\n\nmore informal reality.      It is common for one side to speak with the\n\n\n                                      -98-\n\fprobation officer, either before or after the report is released.\n\nOne district court has stated that, in that court's experience, ex\n\nparte communications between the government and the probation\n\nofficer   preparing        the    report    are    \"appropriate    and   regular.\"\n\nRoccisano v. United States, 936 F. Supp. 96, 103 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).\n\nBut we could not fully embrace such informality without reading\n\nRule 32(b) out of the Federal Rules; Rule 32(b) does require a more\n\nstructured process, at least in the fourteen-day period following\n\nthe release of the presentence report.\n\n     Rule     32(b)    is    literally       read    as   permitting     ex    parte\n\ncommunications initiated by either party both before and after this\n\nfourteen-day period.             During the fourteen-day period, however,\n\nwhile the parties are preparing their written objections to the\n\npresentence report, the parties, under the rule, should communicate\n\nwith the probation officer only in writing, and all communications\n\nmust be disclosed to the other party.                 This reading of the rule\n\npermits most of the present informality, while allowing both sides\n\nto know the scope of the objections.                      See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n32(b)(6)(B)    advisory      committee      notes    to   1994   Amendments     (the\n\nparties should have a \"fair opportunity . . . to review, object to,\n\nand comment upon, the probation officer's report in advance of the\n\nsentencing hearing\").            There are benefits to informality, but the\n\nparties   should      at    least    know   what    issues   are   on    the   table\n\nconcerning the presentence report so they can present counter-\n\n\n                                        -99-\n\farguments if they desire.\n\n     Even if contact with Agent Plichta did inadvertently violate\n\nRule 32, Caribe has failed to show that he has suffered any harm as\n\na result.    First, he does not explain what he hoped to accomplish\n\nby additional discovery or by calling the probation officer to\n\ntestify at the sentencing hearing.         The revised presentence report\n\napparently sets forth the additional evidence the probation officer\n\nrelied upon in amending her recommendations, and all other facts\n\nappear to be undisputed.      Second, as the district court noted, the\n\nreport is only a recommendation to the court; the court is not\n\nbound to accept these recommendations.         The district court in this\n\ncase had notice that the second report was prepared after the\n\nprosecution's alleged ex parte contact and gave Caribe's counsel\n\nample     opportunity    at   sentencing     to   dispute    the   report's\n\nrecommendations.    The court then found that the enhancements were\n\nappropriate and sentenced the defendant accordingly.             Thus Caribe\n\nfails to show what harm he suffered as a result of the ex parte\n\ncommunications.    See, e.g., Montoya, 62 F.3d at 3 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(\"[T]he     sentencing    court   has   ample     power     to   deal   with\n\n[prosecutorial misconduct impacting the judge's sentencing options]\n\nby excluding the tainted transaction from the computation of\n\nrelevant conduct or by departing from the [recommendation].\").\n\n\n\n\n                                  -100-\n\fM.   Conclusion\n\n      We affirm the judgments and the sentences and reject each of\n\nthe defendant's claims, except that we remand, in accordance with\n\nthis opinion, the issue of the term of supervised release for\n\nRodriguez and vacate that aspect only of his sentence. So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -101-\n\f",

Apprendi (Nelson, Rodriguez, Arroyo, Bonet, Chevere, Caribe,\n\nRivera, and Valle)\n\n     All of the appellants except for Romero, who pled guilty,\n\nargue that their sentences were imposed in violation of Apprendi v.\n\nNew Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000).        Apprendi held that \"[o]ther than\n\nthe fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty\n\nfor a     crime   beyond   the   prescribed   statutory   maximum   must   be\n\nsubmitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"          Id. at\n\n2362-63.    The defendants raise several distinct Apprendi claims,\n\nand we address each in turn.\n\n     1.    Facial Challenge to 21 U.S.C. § 841\n\n     The defendants make a facial challenge to 21 U.S.C. § 841.13\n\nSection 841(a) makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly or\n\nintentionally distribute or possess with intent to distribute a\n\ncontrolled substance.        Section 841(b) lists the penalties for\n\nviolation of section 841(a), which vary depending on the drug type\n\nand quantity.      Defendants say this renders the statute facially\n\nunconstitutional.\n\n     This argument about § 841 is foreclosed by United States v.\n\nCollazo-Aponte, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776643\"><a href=\"/opinion/776643/united-states-v-rafael-collazo-aponte/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st. Cir. 2002), which held that\n\n\"there is nothing in the statutory language that explicitly defies\n\n\n     13\n        The defendants were convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 846, not\n21 U.S.C. § 841, but they challenge § 841 because § 846 makes it\nunlawful to attempt or conspire to commit the offenses listed in §\n841. Therefore, the constitutionality of § 846 is dependent upon\nthe constitutionality of § 841.\n\n                                     -55-\n\fApprendi\" because \"[t]he statute is silent as to who makes these\n\nfindings and under what burden of persuasion.\"      Id. at 325.   Our\n\ndecision in Collazo-Aponte is consistent with the decisions of all\n\ncircuits that have addressed this issue.    See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Buckland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777584\"><a href=\"/opinion/777584/united-states-v-calvin-wayne-buckland/\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 562 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc); United\n\nStates v.

Section 841(a) requires the defendant to \"knowingly or\n\nintentionally\" possess controlled substances with an intent to\n\ndistribute.   The defendants argue that this mens rea requirement\n\napplies to all elements of the crime, including those listed in §\n\n841(b). However, as we held in Collazo-Aponte, \"The plain language\n\nof § 841(b) requires the government to prove only that the offense\n\n'involved' a particular type and quantity of drugs, not that the\n\ndefendant knew that he was distributing that particular drug type\n\nand quantity.\"     281 F.3d at 326.    The presumption in favor of a\n\nscienter requirement does not apply in this case because the\n\nelements in § 841(b) only set the penalty and do not criminalize\n\notherwise innocent conduct.\n\n     2.   Vague Allegations in Indictment\n\n     Defendants argue that the indictment was inadequate in that it\n\n\n                                -56-\n\fmade only vague allegations as to the type and quantity of the\n\ndrugs involved in the conspiracy.              It is true that Apprendi\n\nconsiders any fact (other than a prior conviction) that increases\n\nthe penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum to be an\n\nelement of the crime.      But the indictment here easily meets this\n\nrequirement.      The    superseding       indictment    charged   that     the\n\ndefendants possessed with intent to distribute over 1,000 kilograms\n\nof   cocaine,   five    kilograms   of   heroin,   and    5,000    pounds    of\n\nmarijuana. Furthermore, it provided the drug type and quantity for\n\neach of the planned importations at issue at trial, stating for\n\nexample that Arroyo and Rivera met \"two other persons known to the\n\nGrand Jury,\" CIS Hernandez and Diaz, to discuss the importation of\n\napproximately 1,200 kilograms of cocaine into Puerto Rico in May\n\n1997, and that Rivera, Torres, and Chevere received a shipment of\n\n250 kilograms of cocaine in July 1997.           Such detail is more than\n\nsufficient to meet Apprendi's mandate, and we therefore reject\n\ndefendants' claim.\n\n      3.   Lack of Jury Determination of Drug Type and Quantity\n\n      Defendants argue that their sentences must be vacated because\n\nthe jury did not determine drug type or quantity.             In fact, the\n\njury verdict sheet asked simply whether a particular defendant was\n\nguilty of the one count in the indictment, a copy of which was\n\nprovided to the jury.      The indictment charged that the defendants\n\n      did unlawfully, knowingly, willfully, and intentionally\n      combine, conspire, confederate, and agree together with divers\n\n                                    -57-\n\f      other persons to the Grand Jury known and unknown, to possess\n      with intent to distribute amounts of cocaine, a Schedule II\n      narcotic drug controlled substance, which amounts of cocaine\n      exceeded One Thousand (1,000) kilograms; heroin, a Schedule I,\n      Narcotic Drug Controlled Substance, which amounts of heroin\n      exceeded Five (5) kilograms; and marijuana, a Schedule I\n      controlled substance, which amounts exceeded Five Thousand\n      (5,000) pounds of marijuana\n\n\n(emphasis added).    It also specified particular amounts and kinds\n\nof drugs for transactions in which those defendants participated.\n\n      We understand the argument to have several parts, including\n\nfirst that the jury, at a minimum, had to decide the drug quantity\n\nand   type   for   the   underlying   conspiracy   (to   the   extent   of\n\ndetermining a quantity which sets the maximum sentence under § 841\n\nthat would be applicable to the conspirators).       The argument moves\n\nto another level with the assertion that it was error for the trial\n\njudge to deny the requests of several defendants that the jury make\n\nan individualized determination as to the drug type and quantity\n\nwhich could be attributed to that defendant.        Both arguments have\n\nin common the assertion that Apprendi required these issues to be\n\nsubmitted to the jury in light of the fact that the defendants\n\nreceived sentences greater than the default statutory maximum. The\n\nrelevant default statutory maximum is based on distribution of less\n\nthan 50 kilograms of marijuana, which produces a maximum sentence\n\nof five years for first felony drug convictions and ten years if\n\nthere is a prior such conviction.        21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D).\n\n      It is common ground, and the government concedes, that the\n\n\n                                  -58-\n\fdefendants were entitled to some form of jury determination as to\n\nquantity -- whether general or individual is a separate question --\n\nbefore being subject to more than the default statutory maximum.\n\nHere, there was no jury determination of either sort.               One might\n\nsuppose from the indictment quoted above that the jury necessarily\n\nfound the quantities there specified, but in fact review of the\n\njury   instructions   confirms   that    the   jury   was   asked    only   to\n\ndetermine whether there was a conspiracy as charged, not whether it\n\ncovered any specific amounts of drugs.          The government does not\n\nclaim otherwise.\n\n       However, the jury's failure to determine drug type and amount\n\nis not fatal if the evidence overwhelmingly establishes the amount.\n\nUnited States v. Cotton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118505\"><a href=\"/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002).           In this instance,\n\nour review shows that this is so as to all defendants, whether the\n\ntest is plain error or harmless error and whether the figure\n\nrelates to the overall conspiracy or to the individual defendant.\n\nWe will return to these calculations in due course.            But for the\n\nsake of future litigation, it is useful to say something more about\n\nboth the requirements for preservation of Apprendi claims and the\n\nproblem of general versus specific findings as to amount of drugs.\n\nWe begin with the latter.\n\n       In United States v. Derman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 42-44 (1st Cir.\n\n2002), this court ruled that it was sufficient to satisfy Apprendi\n\nif the jury found that the conspiracy charged was to distribute, or\n\n\n                                  -59-\n\fpossess with intent to distribute, a specific quantity (assuming\n\nthat this figure triggered the higher maximum sentence at issue).\n\nIf   the   defendant   were   convicted   of   participating   in   such   a\n\nconspiracy, this necessarily meant that he was liable, for Apprendi\n\npurposes, for the quantity of the overall conspiracy. We therefore\n\nheld that there was no Apprendi error where a jury\n\n      has determined that the conspiracy involved a type and\n      quantity of drugs sufficient to justify a sentence above the\n      default statutory maximum and has found a particular defendant\n      guilty of participation in the conspiracy[.]         [In this\n      situation,] the judge lawfully may determine the drug quantity\n      attributable to that defendant and sentence him accordingly\n      (so long as the sentence falls within the statutory maximum\n      made applicable by the jury's conspiracy-wide drug quantity\n      determination).\n\n\nDerman, 298 F.3d at 43.\n\n      A number of other circuits have taken the same view as to the\n\nissue required to be decided by the jury if the default maximum is\n\nto be exceeded.

Of course,\n\nsuch a jury determination by itself merely establishes a new\n\nstatutory maximum under Apprendi; it does not set the defendant's\n\nguideline sentence, which will often be less than the statutory\n\nmaximum and which depends on numerous determinations specific to\n\nthe individual defendant, including role in the offense, attributed\n\nrelevant conduct, past criminal history, and the like.\n\n      Derman thus answers in this circuit the defendants' claim that\n\n                                   -60-\n\fthey are entitled under Apprendi to a defendant-specific finding by\n\nthe jury as to the amount of drugs properly attributed to an\n\nindividual defendant in a conspiracy case.          But we recognize that\n\nthis is not necessarily the last word on the subject. Conceivably,\n\nborrowing     from   related   doctrines,   one      could    construct   a\n\nforeseeability test of some kind -- attributing to each defendant\n\nthe amount that the individual agreed upon, actually handled, and\n\nreasonably could have foreseen that others would handle -- and\n\ncould ask the jury by special interrogatories to identify such an\n\namount.\n\n     Derman    itself   involved   a   relatively    simple    conspiracy:\n\ngrowing marijuana in an underground greenhouse, first on Derman's\n\nproperty, then on another's.       See 298 F.3d at 37.       In such cases,\n\nit would be a simple matter for the government to indict on the\n\ncharge that a particular defendant joined an agreement to possess\n\nthe quantity of drugs grown in the greenhouse, with the intent to\n\ndistribute that quantity, and to seek a special verdict to that\n\neffect.     That simple approach may break down for more complex\n\nconspiracies involving multiple transactions of different amounts\n\nof drugs imported at different times, with a shifting cast of\n\nactors.   A series of problems implicating sentencing then arises.\n\nA particular defendant, for example, may have agreed to import\n\nseven kilograms of a drug, but not agreed to import ten, although\n\nit was reasonably foreseeable to him that his coconspirators would\n\n\n                                   -61-\n\fimport ten.     Or a particular defendant may have gone in and then\n\nout of a conspiracy.     See Edwards v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118200\"><a href=\"/opinion/118200/edwards-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1998).   There may be one conspiracy; there may be multiple\n\nconspiracies.     Or a defendant may raise Pinkerton issues.         See\n\nPinkerton v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104316\"><a href=\"/opinion/104316/pinkerton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1946).         Some of these\n\nproblems might be solved by more specificity in indictments, by\n\ntailored instructions, and by special verdicts.\n\n     Such an endeavor would pose issues of its own too numerous to\n\nrecount in full.    It would implicate the instructions that define\n\nconspiracy, itself a tangled subject with built-in tension.           It\n\ncould also have practical disadvantages for some defendants by\n\ncompromising later arguments they might otherwise make to the judge\n\nconcerning the application of the sentencing guidelines.             But\n\nApprendi itself is a recent innovation; it is too early to expect\n\nall of its implications to be worked out, and only the Supreme\n\nCourt can provide final guidance.        It is enough here that Derman\n\nprovides provisional guidance for the circuit and that the outcome\n\nfor the defendants in this case would not change even if Derman\n\nwere overturned.\n\n     In explaining this last determination, we consider first        the\n\nlevel of review to which each defendant is entitled and then\n\nexamine   separately    the   evidence    bearing   on   drug   quantity\n\nattributable to each individual defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -62-\n\f      a.     Preservation of Objection\n\n      Valle's appeal raises the question, new to us, of what must be\n\ndone at trial to preserve an Apprendi objection.                Valle was\n\nconvicted at the second trial, after the Apprendi decision.14           In\n\nour   only    case   holding   an   Apprendi   objection   preserved,   the\n\nobjection was raised both at trial and at sentencing.              United\n\nStates v. Bailey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199664\"><a href=\"/opinion/199664/united-states-v-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 88-90 (1st Cir. 2001).         Apprendi is\n\nprimarily about sentencing, but it also has implications for\n\nindictment and trial, at least in relation to a sentence which\n\nrests on facts which elevate the sentence above the statutory\n\nminimum.\n\n      For future cases, we think it sufficient if the defendant\n\nraises the issue at sentencing.        The defendant, of course, has no\n\ninterest in being sentenced above the maximum and no incentive to\n\nrequest that the jury specifically determine those facts which\n\nwould carry him above that level.           The government, on the other\n\nhand, does have an interest in going above the maximum, so it\n\nshould bear the burden of requesting submission of the issue to the\n\njury.      Further, a defendant will not know whether there is an\n\n\n      14\n        Apprendi was decided on June 26, 2000. We have been asked\nhere to evaluate whether there was Apprendi error in two trials,\none of which took place before Apprendi was decided and the other\nof which began after Apprendi. These cases were indicted in 1998,\nand the first trial came to verdict in October 1999. Five of the\nsix appellants convicted at this first trial were also sentenced\nbefore the Apprendi decision; Caribe, the sixth, was sentenced on\nDecember 15, 2000. Valle and Rivera were convicted at the second\ntrial, which began in September 2000, after Apprendi.\n\n                                     -63-\n\fApprendi error    until    sentencing,      and   then   only    if   the   court\n\nconsiders   a   sentence   above    the    maximum.      An     objection    from\n\ndefendant at the point of sentencing will be timely.\n\n     Rivera requested before the jury was charged that the district\n\ncourt submit the question of drug quantity and type to the jury in\n\na special verdict. Valle joined in this initial objection. Rivera\n\nrenewed his objection at sentencing, but Valle did not.                       The\n\ngovernment argues that Valle waived his Apprendi claim by failing\n\nto renew his objection after the jury was charged or at sentencing.\n\nThe district court denied Rivera and Valle's request, presumably\n\nbecause this court had not yet held that Apprendi applied to § 846\n\nprosecutions; under prior circuit law, the drug quantity and type\n\ndetermination for sentencing purposes was for the judge to decide.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Lindia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196710\"><a href=\"/opinion/196710/united-states-v-lindia/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1154</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1160-61 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).   It was not until January 2, 2001, some three months after\n\nthe trial judge acted here, that this circuit decided that Apprendi\n\napplied to §§ 841 and 846.      United States v. Baltas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199221\"><a href=\"/opinion/199221/united-states-v-baltas/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n40-41 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n     Thus, this case may be viewed as a transition case to a new\n\npost-Apprendi    regime,   before    this    court    applied     Apprendi     to\n\nprosecutions under §§ 841 and 846.           In this transition context,\n\nwhere the defendant did raise the issue and ask for a special\n\nverdict, we have sympathy for the argument that this is enough to\n\npreserve the Apprendi objection.           Still, given Bousley v. United\n\n\n                                    -64-\n\fStates,   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118205\"><a href=\"/opinion/118205/bousley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span>     <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>   <span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">   (1998),   the   waiver   analysis   is   very\n\ncomplicated and we prefer to assume rather than decide that the\n\nissue was preserved in these circumstances.\n\n     b.   Valle\n\n     Valle's sentence of 360 months exceeds the default statutory\n\nmaximum for cocaine offenses of twenty years and so raises a valid\n\nclaim of Apprendi error.\n\n     The jury found Valle guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of\n\nparticipating in a drug conspiracy.        The only transaction in which\n\nValle was alleged to be a participant was the planned importation\n\nof 1,100 kilograms of cocaine in the summer of 1997.         Therefore the\n\njury must have found that Valle participated in this transaction.\n\nThe only issue is the type and amount of drugs involved in this\n\ntransaction, an issue that appears to have been undisputed at\n\ntrial. See, e.g., United States v. Swatzie, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1278</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1283\n\n(11th Cir. 2000) (affirming where there was no evidentiary basis\n\nfor the jury to find that the defendant had possessed cocaine with\n\nintent to distribute but that the quantity of cocaine involved was\n\nless than five grams).\n\n     CI Hernandez testified on direct examination at the second\n\ntrial that the transaction involved 1,100 kilograms of cocaine. CI\n\nDiaz also testified that the transaction was to involve between\n\n1,000 and 1,200 kilograms of cocaine.          The drug type and quantity\n\nwas not the subject of any questions on cross-examination; indeed,\n\n\n                                    -65-\n\fdefense counsels' questions appear to take the drug type and\n\nquantity as a given.   Nor did defense counsel raise the issue in\n\nclosing arguments.   Finally, Valle does not point to any evidence\n\non appeal that would cast doubt on the alleged drug type or\n\nquantity involved in this transaction. See, e.g., United States v.\n\nMartinez-Medina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776396\"><a href=\"/opinion/776396/united-states-v-marcos-martinez-medina-united-states-of-america-v-manuel/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 122 (1st Cir. 2002) (dismissing\n\ndefendants' Apprendi claims under harmless error review in part\n\nbecause neither defendant seriously denied that the conspiracy\n\ninvolved at least five kilograms of cocaine).       We thus conclude\n\nthat the Apprendi error as to Valle was harmless.\n\n     c.   Rivera\n\n     Any Apprendi error against Rivera was also harmless.     Rivera\n\nwas sentenced to life imprisonment, while the default statutory\n\nmaximum for a defendant with a prior felony drug conviction (such\n\nas Rivera) is ten years.     The government concedes that Rivera\n\npreserved his Apprendi claim because he raised it at trial and at\n\nsentencing.   The only issue, therefore, is whether the jury must\n\nhave found Rivera guilty of conspiring to possess at least half a\n\nkilogram of cocaine with an intent to distribute.    The trial judge\n\ncan sentence a defendant with a prior felony drug conviction to\n\nlife imprisonment based on that amount of cocaine.     See 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(B).\n\n     At trial, the government produced overwhelming evidence that\n\nthe transactions in which Rivera participated involved at least\n\n\n                               -66-\n\fhalf a kilogram of cocaine.       CI Hernandez and CI Diaz testified as\n\nto the amounts involved in two planned cocaine importations of\n\n1,100    kilograms   and   700   kilograms.     Torres,   the   cooperating\n\ndefendant, testified that Rivera was involved in the successful\n\nimportation of 250 kilograms of cocaine.              Their testimony was\n\nsupported    by   evidence   from   wiretaps    and   other   surveillance.\n\nRivera's counsel did not contest the type or amount of drugs\n\ninvolved in any of these importations at trial.           Rivera argues on\n\nappeal that the jury could not have been sure of the drug type or\n\nquantity involved because these were \"dry\" conspiracies, which\n\nmeans that the government did not seize any drugs.            The amount of\n\nthe drugs was clear, nonetheless.             There is simply no serious\n\nargument that the jury could have convicted Rivera believing that\n\nhe participated in a conspiracy involving less than half a kilogram\n\nof cocaine.\n\n        Rivera also relies on our decision in Collazo-Aponte to argue\n\nthat an Apprendi error can never be harmless.          That case does not\n\nstand for this proposition.         The defendant in Collazo-Aponte did\n\nnot preserve his Apprendi error at trial, which means that this\n\ncourt normally would have reviewed his claim under plain error\n\nreview and, as part of that inquiry, examined the evidence against\n\nhim.     We did not do so, however, because the government conceded\n\nthat the error was plain.        Collazo-Aponte, 281 F.3d at 324.      Thus\n\nthere was no reason for the court to go through the plain error\n\n\n                                    -67-\n\fanalysis.     Had the government not made this concession, we would\n\nhave reviewed the evidence presented at trial to determine whether\n\nthe defendant's Apprendi claim survived plain error review.\n\n     d.   Arroyo\n\n     Arroyo's sentence of 324 months was also contrary to Apprendi\n\nbecause it exceeded the ten-year default statutory maximum for\n\nprior offenders. Arroyo did not raise an Apprendi claim before the\n\ndistrict court, and review is for plain error.      Arroyo, who was\n\nreplaced as Rivera's lieutenant when he demanded a million dollars,\n\nwas connected only to the first planned importation, involving\n\n1,100 kilograms of cocaine. The jury could have convicted him only\n\non this basis.     Arroyo did not dispute at trial the drug type or\n\namount involved in this planned importation, nor does he dispute\n\nthese facts on appeal.   Moreover, no jury could have failed to find\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy involved some amount\n\nof cocaine, triggering a maximum sentence of thirty years.       CI\n\nHernandez testified in great detail about their plans to import\n\n1,100 kilograms of cocaine, and CI Diaz testified to some of the\n\nsame facts.    There was no plain error.\n\n     e.   Caribe\n\n     We review Caribe's Apprendi claim for harmless error because\n\nhe raised the claim at sentencing.      Caribe was sentenced to 420\n\nmonths, which was above the applicable five-year statutory maximum.\n\nThis sentence would be authorized by 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B) if\n\n\n                                 -68-\n\fthe conspiracy involved at least half a kilogram of cocaine or more\n\nthan 100 kilograms of marijuana.              Caribe argues that the error was\n\nnot    harmless     because     the    evidence     linking    him    to   the   drug\n\nconspiracy was slim and relied primarily on the testimony of\n\ngovernment informants of dubious credibility. The evidence against\n\nCaribe was much stronger than his re-telling of it; but he has\n\nsimply focused on the wrong target.                The jury did convict him of\n\nconspiring to possess drugs with an intent to distribute them; the\n\nonly    remaining    issue      is    the   type   and    quantity    of   the   drugs\n\ninvolved.\n\n       The jury could not have convicted Caribe without finding that\n\nhe was involved in the conspiracy's final planned importation.\n\nCaribe did not dispute the type or quantity of drugs involved in\n\nthat plan at trial and does not do so on appeal.                CI Diaz testified\n\nthat the importation involved 700 kilograms of drugs.                       There is\n\nless evidence about the type of drugs involved.                      Diaz testified\n\nonly that there were \"700 kilos\" involved; he never explicitly said\n\nwhat type of drugs the conspirators planned to import, although one\n\nquestion during his cross-examination referred to cocaine, and he\n\ndid not correct defense counsel.               Nonetheless, it does not matter\n\nfor Apprendi purposes what type of drug was involved.                       The only\n\ndrugs    charged     in   the    indictment        were    cocaine,    heroin,    and\n\nmarijuana. Under § 841(b)(1)(B), Caribe's sentence was permissible\n\nregardless of what type of drugs were involved, as long as the\n\n\n                                            -69-\n\fconspiracy involved at least 700 kilograms of any of these types of\n\ndrugs.\n\n     f.   Bonet\n\n     Bonet's sentence of 360 months was contrary to Apprendi\n\nbecause it exceeded the ten-year default statutory maximum for\n\nprior offenders.      His sentence would be valid under 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(D) as long as he conspired to possess with intent to\n\ndistribute any amount of cocaine or at least fifty grams of\n\nmarijuana.   He argues that we should review his claim for harmless\n\nerror because his co-defendant Nelson made an Apprendi objection.\n\nHowever, the trial judge required each defense counsel to make\n\ntheir own objections, and Bonet's counsel did not join in Nelson's\n\nApprendi objection.    We review Bonet's claim for plain error.\n\n     Like Caribe, the evidence tied Bonet to the conspiracy's final\n\nplanned importation in the fall of 1997.    The same analysis that\n\napplied to Caribe also applies to Bonet: there was overwhelming\n\nevidence of a quantity of \"700 kilos,\" and that quantity of drugs\n\nis sufficient to justify his sentence regardless of whether the\n\ntype of narcotic was cocaine, heroin, or marijuana.   See 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(B).\n\n     g.   Nelson\n\n     Nelson's sentence of 293 months raises a potential Apprendi\n\nissue because it exceeded the ten-year default statutory maximum\n\nfor prior offenders.     His sentence would be permissible if the\n\n\n                                -70-\n\fconspiracy involved at least 50 kilograms of marijuana or any\n\namount of cocaine.     See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D).      Nelson made an\n\nApprendi objection only during trial; we review his claim for\n\nharmless error.\n\n     The primary evidence against Nelson at trial concerned the\n\nplanned importations of 36 kilograms of cocaine and approximately\n\n6,000 pounds of marijuana.          The jury could not have convicted\n\nNelson without finding that he was involved in at least one of\n\nthese ventures.     The Apprendi error was harmless because evidence\n\nestablishing the amount and type of drugs involved in both of these\n\nplans was overwhelming and undisputed at trial.         CI Hernandez and\n\ncooperating   defendant    Torres    both   testified   that   Nelson   had\n\nattempted to bring 36 kilograms of cocaine into Puerto Rico. There\n\nwas some dispute as to Nelson's motivations for participating in\n\nthe transaction, but he never disputed the type or quantity of\n\ndrugs involved.     As to marijuana, the government at trial played a\n\nrecording of a conversation between Rivera and Nelson in which they\n\ndiscussed importing 6,000 pounds of marijuana.          Nelson offered no\n\nevidence to rebut this point, and at sentencing did not dispute the\n\ncontention that the plan involved 6,000 pounds of marijuana.\n\n     h.   Chevere\n\n     Chevere's sentence of 540 months raised a potential Apprendi\n\nissue because it exceeded the five-year default statutory maximum.\n\nThe sentence would be permissible under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A) as\n\n\n                                    -71-\n\flong as he was involved in a conspiracy involving at least five\n\nkilograms of cocaine or 1,000 kilograms of marijuana.                 Chevere\n\nargues that his claim should be reviewed for harmless error because\n\nhe says his counsel raised an Apprendi claim at sentencing.               The\n\ntranscript   of   his    sentencing    hearing   shows   that   his   counsel\n\nchallenged only Chevere's involvement in the conspiracy and the\n\nbase level calculation, not the amount or type of drugs.          We review\n\nhis claim for plain error.\n\n     Although there was not evidence that Chevere conspired to\n\nimport marijuana, the evidence did tie him to the successful\n\nimportation of 250 kilograms of cocaine.          Torres, the cooperating\n\ndefendant, testified that Chevere was in charge of security for\n\nthat importation.       There was no dispute about the type or quantity\n\nof drugs involved. Torres was directly involved in the importation\n\nand testified that he and the other conspirators imported 250\n\nkilograms of cocaine.        He described in detail how he and Rivera\n\nsplit the load and how Rivera planned to send his share to New York\n\nfor distribution. CI Hernandez also testified that Rivera told him\n\nthat he successfully imported 250 kilograms of cocaine into Puerto\n\nRico.\n\n     Chevere claims that the transaction never took place despite\n\nTorres and Hernandez's testimony to the contrary.          To support this\n\nclaim, he points to the fact that the FBI, which had Rivera's\n\norganization under surveillance, did not see the delivery of\n\n\n                                      -72-\n\fcocaine.    However, the jury necessarily found that the transaction\n\ndid   occur,    whether   or   not   it   was   observed    by   investigators\n\ndirectly.      There was no evidence that this importation involved a\n\nsmaller amount of cocaine.\n\n       i.   Rodriguez\n\n      Rodriguez's sentence of 151 months was contrary to Apprendi\n\nbecause it exceeded the default statutory maximum of five years.\n\nThe sentence would be permissible as long as Rodriguez participated\n\nin a conspiracy involving any amount of cocaine.                 We review his\n\nclaim for plain error because he did not raise it at trial.\n\n      The only evidence at trial relating to Rodriguez tied him to\n\nthe successful importation of 250 kilograms of cocaine.                  Taped\n\ntelephone conversations played at trial showed that Rodriguez\n\ndelivered the cocaine imported in that transaction to New York,\n\nwhere it was distributed by Figueroa, Caribe's brother-in-law. The\n\njury could not have convicted Rodriguez without believing that he\n\nwas involved in this aspect of the conspiracy.             The amount and type\n\nof drugs in the successful importation were undisputed at trial,\n\nand thus we reject Rodriguez's Apprendi claim.\n\nI.    Substantial Assistance Departure (Romero)\n\n      Romero pled guilty and presents one issue, a sentencing issue,\n\non his appeal.       He argues that the sole reason the government\n\nfailed to move that he be given a Section 5K1.1 sentence reduction\n\nfor substantial assistance was an impermissible one: it was in\n\n\n                                     -73-\n\fretaliation for his telling the truth in his third debriefing, a\n\ntruth which was exculpatory as to codefendant Ortiz.\n\n      U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1 provides: \"Upon motion of the government\n\nstating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in\n\nthe   investigation    or   prosecution       of    another      person    who   has\n\ncommitted an offense, the court may depart from the guidelines.\"\n\nSee also 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) (\"Upon motion of the Government, the\n\ncourt shall have the authority to impose a sentence below a level\n\nestablished by statute as minimum sentence so as to reflect a\n\ndefendant's      substantial     assistance        in   the    investigation      or\n\nprosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\").\n\nRomero's plea agreement stated that \"[t]he United States reserves\n\nits option to seek any departure from the applicable sentencing\n\nguidelines, pursuant to Section 5K1.1 . . . if in its discretion\n\nthe United States determines that such a departure is appropriate.\"\n\nThe agreement further specified that \"[t]he defendant agrees that\n\nthe   decision    whether   to   file   such   motion         rests   in   the   sole\n\ndiscretion of the United States.\"\n\n      The district court, after hearing proffers from both counsel,\n\nrejected the argument and declined to take testimony from Agent\n\nPlichta, who conducted the debriefings at issue here.                        Romero\n\nargued that there was error in not holding an evidentiary hearing\n\nand in not compelling the government to file such a motion.\n\n      Our review of questions of law is de novo; our review of the\n\n\n                                     -74-\n\ffact-based conclusion of the district court as to the substantial\n\nassistance question is for clear error.

In this\n\narea, the government acts under two constraints. First, the law is\n\nclear   that   the     government     may    not    base      its       decision    on   an\n\nunconstitutional motive, such as racial prejudice.                          See Wade v.\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112734\"><a href=\"/opinion/112734/wade-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 185-86 (1992).                       Second, because the\n\ngovernment entered into a plea agreement with Romero, it had to\n\ncarry out in good faith the obligations it assumed under the\n\nagreement. See United States v. Alegria, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198656\"><a href=\"/opinion/198656/united-states-v-alegria/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 186-87 (1st\n\nCir. 1999); see also United States v.

This good-faith requirement applies even though the\n\nplea agreement specifies that the \"government retains absolute\n\ndiscretion with respect to the filing of a section 5K1.1 motion.\"\n\nAlegria, 192 F.3d at 186-87.\n\n      Whether viewed as part of the Wade obligation or the Alegria\n\nobligation, the government may not base its refusal to seek a\n\nsubstantial      assistance     departure      on       a    defendant's         truthful\n\ndisclosure of exculpatory information.              We can think of few things\n\n\n                                       -75-\n\fmore corrosive to the criminal justice system than prosecutorial\n\nretaliation against a witness for telling the truth. If these were\n\nthe government's grounds, they would both be impermissible and have\n\nno rational relationship to a legitimate government end.                 Cf.\n\nDavis, 247 F.3d at 326.\n\n     The district court held that Romero had not made a threshold\n\nshowing of improper motivation by the government. See Alegria, 192\n\nF.3d at 187.    In explaining to the district court its reasons for\n\nnot filing a Section 5K1.1 motion, the government used language\n\nthat was likely to arouse suspicion.        It complained that, because\n\nof Romero's statements and writings produced at the third of his\n\nfour debriefings, the prosecution was forced to provide defense\n\ncounsel with Brady and Jencks material. Appropriately concerned by\n\nthese statements, the district judge investigated further and took\n\nproffers from both counsel.\n\n     In   the   end,   the   district   court   was   satisfied   that   the\n\ngovernment had reason to think Romero was not truthful at the last\n\ntwo debriefings and, while he had given assistance, he had not\n\ngiven substantial assistance. Romero's untruthfulness was shown by\n\nthe fact that he did not disclose certain information helpful to\n\nOrtiz and Nelson until his third debriefing, and that this newly-\n\ndisclosed information appeared to be inconsistent with information\n\nprovided by another cooperating witness. As the trial judge noted,\n\nthe government had told the court it intended to use Romero as a\n\n\n                                   -76-\n\fprosecution witness at trial but then did not do so.        This decision\n\nnot to call Romero as a witness was entirely consistent with the\n\ngovernment's view, expressed at sentencing, that Romero was not\n\ntruthful.    And, as the district court aptly noted, substantial\n\nassistance is a higher standard for a defendant to meet than mere\n\ncooperation.      Romero's   failure   to   be   forthcoming    in   earlier\n\ndebriefings evidenced his failure to meet this higher standard.\n\n       When faced with such Section 5K1.1 claims where there is a\n\nplea   agreement,   the   government     bears   the   modest   burden    of\n\nproduction, not persuasion.        Alegria, 192 F.3d at 187.             The\n\ngovernment must offer \"facially adequate reasons.\" Id. at 188. It\n\ndid so here.      The judge, who sat through a lengthy trial and\n\ninquired into this matter, found nothing impermissible about the\n\ngovernment's reasons for declining to seek a substantial assistance\n\ndeparture.     Given the judge's extensive exploration of the issue\n\nwith counsel, no separate evidentiary hearing was required.\n\nJ.   Supervised Release Terms (Bonet and Rodriguez)\n\n       Bonet and Rodriguez challenge the length of their terms of\n\nsupervised release.    The district judge sentenced Bonet to twenty\n\nyears of supervised release and Rodriguez to fifteen years.            Both\n\ndefendants claim that these terms were invalid because they were\n\ndisproportionately longer as a percentage of their total years of\n\nimprisonment than their codefendants' terms.            This argument is\n\nforeclosed by 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a), which establishes the limited\n\n\n                                  -77-\n\fcircumstances in which a defendant can seek review of his sentence.\n\nAs the Seventh Circuit held in United States v. Rios-Calderon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715686\"><a href=\"/opinion/715686/united-states-v-juan-rios-calderon-and-daniel-nungaray-robles/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 198 (7th Cir. 1996), \"nothing in § 3742(a) allows review\n\nof a sentence imposed in conformity with the Guidelines on the\n\nground that a codefendant was treated differently.\"                  See also\n\nUnited States v.

We note at the outset that this claim\n\nwas nearly forfeited because of the skeletal manner in which it was\n\nraised.     See Mass. Sch. of Law v. Am. Bar Ass'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197918\"><a href=\"/opinion/197918/massachusetts-school-v-american-bar/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 43\n\n(1st   Cir.   1998)   (claim   is    forfeited    if   it   is   raised   in   a\n\nperfunctory manner unaccompanied by developed argumentation).              But\n\nwe will give Rodriguez the benefit of the doubt and find that the\n\nclaim was not forfeited. Rodriguez's counsel also failed to object\n\nto the length of the supervised release term at sentencing, which\n\nwould normally mean that his claim could be reviewed only for plain\n\nerror.    But we will again give Rodriguez the benefit of the doubt\n\nbecause he was not given advance notice in the presentence report\n\nor by the judge or prosecutor that he could be sentenced to more\n\nthan five years of supervised release, the maximum term specified\n\nin the guidelines.\n\n\n                                      -78-\n\f     We now turn to the merits of Rodriguez's claim.      U.S.S.G. §\n\n5D1.2 states that supervised release terms for Class A or B\n\nfelonies shall be \"at least three years but not more than five\n\nyears.\"   The relevant statute, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), provides\n\nthat the defendant shall be sentenced to a term of supervised\n\nrelease of \"at least five years.\"   This court's recent decision in\n\nUnited States v. Cortes-Claudio held that these provisions should\n\nbe read together to mean that a defendant convicted under 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(A) can be sentenced to only five years of supervised\n\nrelease unless the judge makes a permissible upward departure from\n\nthe guidelines.   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779997\"><a href=\"/opinion/779997/united-states-v-william-cortes-claudio/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18-19 (1st Cir. 2002).   The judge can\n\nmake such a departure if he finds that there are aggravating\n\ncircumstances \"of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into\n\nconsideration by the Sentencing Commission,\" and if the parties are\n\ngiven advance notice that the judge is contemplating making such a\n\ndeparture and of the grounds on which the judge is contemplating\n\ndeparting.   Id. at 24; see also United States v. Burns, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112620\"><a href=\"/opinion/112620/burns-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 138-39 (1991).\n\n     The district judge in this case did not anticipate this\n\ncourt's decision in Cortes-Claudio and mistakenly concluded that\n\nthe guidelines did not apply to the length of a supervised release\n\nterm imposed under 21 U.S.C. § 841.      Thus he did not give the\n\nparties notice of a possible upward departure or make the required\n\nfindings of aggravating circumstances to support the departure. We\n\n\n                                -79-\n\faccordingly vacate Rodriguez's fifteen-year supervised release term\n\nand remand to the district court for re-sentencing as to the length\n\nof the term of supervised release.                On remand, should the district\n\ncourt find that there are aggravating circumstances of a kind, or\n\nto   a        degree,   not   adequately    taken   into   consideration   by   the\n\nSentencing Commission, it must still give the parties advance\n\nnotice that it is contemplating departing and the grounds of the\n\npossible departure and give them an opportunity to respond.\n\nK.   Other Sentencing Guidelines Issues\n\n         1. Drug quantities (Caribe, Bonet, Valle, Chevere, Arroyo,\n            Nelson, Rodriguez)\n\n\n         In sentencing, the district court took into account the amount\n\nof drugs that could be attributed to each defendant.                       Several\n\ndefendants challenge these determinations, which are distinct from\n\nclaims that the determination of quantity by the judge rather than\n\nthe jury violated Apprendi.15              We review the trial court's factual\n\ndeterminations at sentencing for clear error. United States v.\n\nDamon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197584\"><a href=\"/opinion/197584/united-states-v-damon/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 141 (1st Cir. 1997). Legal interpretations of\n\nthe sentencing guidelines are reviewed de novo. United States v.\n\n\n\n         15\n         As we noted above, Apprendi only requires the jury to\ndetermine the drug type and quantity involved in the conspiracy.\nAfter the jury has made this determination, the judge can make\nindividualized   determinations  about   the   amount  of   drugs\nattributable to each defendant. Even though the jury did not make\nits initial determination, we found no reversible error as to any\ndefendant, so that the judge could still determine the amount of\ndrug attributable to each defendant.\n\n                                           -80-\n\fRanney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200051\"><a href=\"/opinion/200051/united-states-v-ranney/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n      a.   Caribe\n\n      Caribe argues that the court erred in setting his base offense\n\nlevel at 38, which is applicable to a quantity of 150 kilograms or\n\nmore of cocaine.         The court set the base offense level after\n\ndetermining that 745 kilograms of cocaine could be attributed to\n\nCaribe.    The court held that Caribe was directly involved in the\n\nconspiracy to import 700 kilograms of cocaine in the fall of 1997.\n\nThis determination was consistent with the testimony of CI Diaz,\n\nwho testified that Caribe was a key player in several meetings to\n\nplan the details of this importation. It also attributed to Caribe\n\n45   kilograms     of   cocaine   out    of    the   successful    250   kilogram\n\nimportation, which he sent to his brother-in-law in New York for\n\ndistribution.       Torres had testified that Caribe was in charge of\n\nmoving some amount of cocaine up to New York, and that he believed\n\nthe amount to be \"about forty-five\" kilograms.               It was not clear\n\nerror for the court to conclude that Caribe was responsible, at\n\nleast in part, for distributing 45 kilograms of cocaine.                     This\n\ntotal quantity of 745 kilograms of cocaine supports the court's\n\ndecision to set Caribe's base offense level at 38.\n\n      b.   Bonet\n\n      The court found Bonet responsible for at least 150 kilograms\n\nof   cocaine,    based    on   Bonet's        involvement   with   the   planned\n\nimportation of 700 kilograms of cocaine.               This determination was\n\n\n                                        -81-\n\fnot   clear    error   considering       Bonet's    role    in     planning     this\n\nimportation.\n\n      Bonet argues that the court should have reduced the amount of\n\ncocaine attributed to the defendants because of the intensive\n\ninvolvement of CIS Hernandez and Diaz in the conspiracy.                    This is\n\na type of improper sentencing factor manipulation argument, for\n\nwhich Bonet has the burden.        As stated in United States v. Montoya,\n\n\"garden variety manipulation claims are largely a waste of time.\"\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196205\"><a href=\"/opinion/196205/united-states-v-montoya/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (1st Cir. 1995).         It is insufficient to say that the\n\nidea of the conspiracy originated with undercover agents, or that\n\nconduct was     encouraged    by   the    government,      or     that    the   crime\n\nexceeded in degree or kind what the defendant had done before.\n\nInstead the defendant must show that elements like these were so\n\nextensive     that   \"the   government's     conduct       must    be     viewed   as\n\nextraordinary misconduct.\"          Id. (internal quotations omitted).\n\nThis standard is high in part because the defendant has the\n\nopportunity to raise an entrapment defense at trial.\n\n      Bonet has fallen far short of this standard; he offers nothing\n\nmore than conclusory allegations. Furthermore, Hernandez testified\n\nthat the Colombians, not he or Diaz, set the amount involved in the\n\ncocaine     importations.       For      example,    in     the     700    kilogram\n\nimportation, Hernandez testified that the Colombians wanted the\n\norganization to import 700 kilograms of cocaine as a test to\n\ndetermine whether its members had the capability to import larger\n\n\n                                      -82-\n\fquantities of drugs in the future.    Bonet also bragged to Diaz that\n\nhe and his team had been drug trafficking for years.           It is\n\nunlikely, therefore, that government agents encouraged Bonet or his\n\ncoconspirators to engage in conduct in which they would otherwise\n\nhave been unwilling to participate.\n\n     c.   Valle\n\n     Valle argues that the judge erred in attributing at least 150\n\nkilograms of cocaine to him.      He did not raise this claim at\n\nsentencing, and therefore it is waived.

The evidence overwhelmingly tied\n\nValle to the planned importation of 1,100 kilograms of drugs.     CI\n\nHernandez testified extensively about Valle's involvement in this\n\ntransaction and the amount and type of drugs involved.\n\n     d.   Chevere\n\n     Chevere argues that the district court erred in finding that\n\nhe was involved in the importation of 250 kilograms of cocaine.\n\nTorres testified that Chevere was in charge of security for this\n\nsuccessful transaction.    Chevere argues that the district court\n\nshould not have used this transaction to set Chevere's base offense\n\n\n                               -83-\n\flevel, because an FBI agent who was watching the delivery location\n\ntestified that he did not actually see the drugs being delivered.\n\nWhether the FBI agent saw it or not, there was ample additional\n\nevidence at trial that the transaction took place, and that Chevere\n\nwas involved in it.   There was no clear error.\n\n      e.   Arroyo\n\n      Arroyo argues error in the attribution of 1,200 kilograms of\n\ncocaine to him because the government did not show that he had the\n\ncapability to transport such a large amount of cocaine.     Arroyo\n\nargues that the government never proved that Arroyo owned a boat\n\nthat could be used to bring the cocaine to Puerto Rico.   Under the\n\nsentencing guidelines, if a planned drug transaction does not take\n\nplace, the sentencing court should base the defendant's drug-\n\nquantity finding on the negotiated amount of drugs, in this case\n\n1,200 kilograms. See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1, cmt. n.12.     However, the\n\ncourt can use a lower amount if \"the defendant establishes that he\n\nor she did not intend to provide, or was not reasonably capable of\n\nproviding, the agreed-upon quantity of the controlled substance.\"\n\nId.   Thus the burden is on Arroyo to show that he was not capable\n\nof transporting 1,200 kilograms of cocaine. Arroyo has not met his\n\nburden in this case and there was no clear error.\n\n      f.   Nelson\n\n      Nelson argues that the district court erred in attributing\n\n99.5 kilograms of cocaine to him.     The court found that he was\n\n\n                               -84-\n\finvolved in the successful importation of 250 kilograms of cocaine\n\nand had a role in distributing 50 kilograms from that shipment.\n\nTorres testified that Rivera gave Nelson some unknown percentage of\n\nRivera's own share of the cocaine from this shipment.                Rivera also\n\ngave a percentage of his share to Caribe and to Chevere, but Torres\n\ndid   not   know    exactly   how   much   each   of   the   three   defendants\n\nreceived; he only knew that together they received 50 kilograms.\n\nNelson and Rivera, in recorded conversations, discussed the price\n\nat which they would be able to sell the cocaine.                The court also\n\nfound that he had a role in the attempted importation of 36\n\nkilograms of cocaine and the transaction involving 6,000 pounds of\n\nmarijuana.      It also could have based its overall findings on\n\nNelson's more general involvement in distributing Rivera's share of\n\nthe cocaine.       We see no clear error in the court's conclusion.\n\n      g.    Rodriguez\n\n      Rodriguez argues that the district court erred in determining\n\nthat his base offense level was 34, which is applicable when the\n\njudge attributes at least 15 kilograms of cocaine to the defendant.\n\nThe government alleged that Rodriguez was involved in delivering to\n\nFigueroa in New York approximately 45 kilograms of cocaine from the\n\n250   kilogram      shipment.        The    government       introduced   taped\n\nconversations in which Rivera told Figueroa that he had arranged\n\nfor someone to deliver the cocaine to Figueroa.                The day before,\n\nRodriguez had flown to New York from San Juan.           The government also\n\n\n                                     -85-\n\fintroduced a recording of a conversation in which Rodriguez and\n\nRivera discussed     the    price   of   cocaine.       At   trial,    Rodriguez\n\ndisputed that he had been involved in the cocaine delivery, but the\n\njury could not have convicted Rodriguez otherwise.                     The only\n\nremaining issue is the amount of drugs that Rodriguez brought to\n\nNew York; Torres testified that Rivera sent \"about 45\" kilograms\n\nthere.     It was not clear error for the judge to attribute at least\n\nfifteen of those kilograms of cocaine to Rodriguez.\n\n      2.    Minor Participant Adjustment (Bonet)\n\n      Bonet argues that the court erred in not granting him a two-\n\nlevel reduction     under   U.S.S.G.     §   3B1.2(b)    for   being    a   minor\n\nparticipant in the conspiracy.           The commentary to this section\n\nstates that \"a minor participant means any participant who is less\n\ncapable than most other participants, but whose role could not be\n\ndescribed as minimal.\"       U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2(b) cmt. n.5.            In seeking\n\na § 3B1.2 adjustment, a defendant \"has the burden of proving that\n\nhe is both less culpable than most others involved in the offense\n\nof   conviction   and   less   culpable      than   most     other    miscreants\n\nconvicted of comparable crimes.\"         United States v. Ortiz-Santiago,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198902\"><a href=\"/opinion/198902/united-states-v-ortiz-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 149 (1st Cir. 2000).              The court did not err in\n\nrefusing to grant this adjustment.           The testimony at trial showed\n\nthat Bonet participated in several of the meetings in which the\n\nconspirators planned the importation of 700 kilograms of cocaine.\n\nBonet was also responsible for testing the radio equipment that\n\n\n                                    -86-\n\fwould be used.   Finally, Bonet told CI Diaz that he had been part\n\nof Rivera's drug trafficking team for many years.    It was entirely\n\nreasonable to conclude that Bonet was no minor participant.\n\n     3.   Special Skills Enhancements (Valle and Bonet)\n\n     Section 3B1.3 of the sentencing guidelines provides that the\n\ndistrict court can increase the offense level two levels if the\n\ndefendant \"used a special skill, in a manner that significantly\n\nfacilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.\"       The\n\ncommentary to this section states, \"'Special skill' refers to a\n\nskill not possessed by members of the general public and usually\n\nrequiring substantial education, training or licensing. Examples\n\nwould include pilots, lawyers, doctors, accountants, chemists, and\n\ndemolition experts.\"    U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3 cmt. n.3.

Valle did not object to this\n\nenhancement at his sentencing hearing, and therefore he waived the\n\nclaim.    Haggert, 980 F.2d at 10-11.    Even if this claim were not\n\nwaived, the record amply supports the determination.\n\n     The district court enhanced Bonet's offense level by two\n\n\n                                -87-\n\flevels because it found that his coconspirators were \"counting on\n\nhis skills as a person knowledgeable with communication equipment.\"\n\n The record establishes that Bonet had a special skill.                   CI Diaz\n\ntestified that on October 30, 1997, Bonet conducted a test of the\n\n20/40    radio   that    the   conspirators       were   planning    to   use   to\n\ncommunicate with the Colombians in order to complete the planned\n\nimportation of 700 kilograms of cocaine.            A 20/40 radio is one that\n\ncan be used to communicate with any part of the world.                      Bonet\n\nshowed Diaz the antenna he had put on a tree outside his house.\n\nBonet then set up the radio and tried to contact the Colombians;\n\nunbeknownst to him, the transmission was intercepted by the FBI.\n\nBonet conducted the test over high and low frequency channels and\n\nhad given the Colombians the same list of frequencies so that the\n\ntwo groups could communicate.         This evidence shows that Bonet had\n\na special skill within the meaning of § 3B1.3.                    Accord United\n\nStates v.

Noah, 130 F.3d at 500.          Instead \"a special skill can be\n\nderived from experience or from self-tutelage.\"             Id.     Nonetheless,\n\nthe defendant must possess skills that members of the general\n\npublic would not have.         Bonet's knowledge was more extensive than\n\n\n                                      -88-\n\fmerely turning on a radio and speaking; he also knew how to\n\nassemble the radio and its antenna and understood how to determine\n\nand locate the frequencies necessary to communicate with the\n\nColombians.\n\n     The   issue    remains      whether      Bonet's    skill   \"significantly\n\nfacilitated the commission . . . of the offense.\"                       U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3B1.3.      Diaz did not testify that Bonet would be the person\n\noperating the radios on the day the shipment was delivered.                    Two\n\nreasonable inferences support a determination that Bonet's special\n\nskill substantially facilitated commission of the crime. We review\n\nboth possible determinations for clear error.\n\n     First,    Bonet's      radio   test      in   and   of   itself   aided   the\n\nconspiracy.     He was responsible for making sure that Rivera's\n\norganization had the necessary radio equipment to handle such a\n\nlarge importation of drugs. The Colombians would not be willing to\n\nentrust Rivera's organization with the shipment if it could not\n\nmake this showing.         Even though Bonet was unable to contact the\n\nColombians during his radio test, it did show Diaz (who, as an\n\nintermediary,      acted    as   the   Colombians'       representative)       that\n\nRivera's organization had at least some of the necessary equipment\n\nand skills.\n\n     Second, an inference that Bonet would be the one operating the\n\nradios the day of the shipment could not be clear error.                   Bonet\n\nplayed an integral part in the meetings.             He told Diaz that he was\n\n\n                                       -89-\n\fskilled as a boat captain, but that he would not be the boat\n\ncaptain for this shipment.        Bonet argues that he never got a chance\n\nto use his special skills to the full extent contemplated by his\n\nconspirators.       However, U.S.S.G. § 2X1.1(a) also covers intended\n\noffense     conduct    that    can   be   established      with   \"reasonable\n\ncertainty.\"     It was not clear error to conclude with reasonable\n\ncertainty    that     Bonet   intended    to   use   his   special   skill   to\n\nfacilitate the crime.

Firearm Enhancement (Caribe)\n\n     The district court increased Caribe's offense level by two\n\nlevels because the court determined that Rivera had a weapon in\n\nCaribe's presence during part of the planning of the 700 kilogram\n\nimportation.     U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1) provides that the judge can\n\nincrease the offense level by two levels \"if a dangerous weapon\n\n(including a firearm) was possessed.\"          The comment to this section\n\nstates that the enhancement applies if a weapon was present, unless\n\nit is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the\n\noffense.     See U.S.S.G. §     2D1.1(b)(1), cmt. n.3.\n\n     The judge found that Caribe was present when Rivera gave CI\n\nDiaz a gun to give to CI Hernandez.            Diaz testified that he met\n\nwith Caribe and Rivera on August 16, 1997.                 At the end of the\n\nmeeting, Rivera gave Diaz a gun that he asked Diaz to give to\n\nHernandez.    Rivera told Diaz that Hernandez could use the gun if he\n\n\n                                     -90-\n\fhad to because it was \"clean.\"            Caribe claims that he left the\n\nmeeting before Rivera gave Diaz the gun, but this claim is not\n\nsupported by the record.       Caribe was the last person to arrive at\n\nthe meeting, but Rivera gave Diaz the gun at the end of the meeting\n\nas they were saying good-bye.      It was not clear error for the judge\n\nto determine that Caribe remained at the meeting at this point.\n\n        Caribe next argues that the government did not establish the\n\nrequired nexus between the gun and the conspiracy. The prosecution\n\nmust show that the defendant (or in a conspiracy case, one of his\n\ncoconspirators) possessed a weapon during the offense.                United\n\nStates v.

The prosecution\n\ndoes not have to show that the defendant or his coconspirators\n\nactually used the gun in perpetrating the offense or intended to do\n\nso.   McDonald, 121 F.3d at 10.        Once the prosecution has made this\n\nshowing, the burden shifts to the defendant to establish that a\n\nconnection between the weapon and the crime was clearly improbable.\n\nId.     Caribe argues that the prosecution did not make its required\n\nshowing because it relied on the uncorroborated testimony of CI\n\nDiaz.    It is routine, and certainly not clear error, for the trial\n\njudge    to   credit   a   witness's    testimony   in   making   sentencing\n\ndeterminations, even if the testimony is not corroborated by other\n\nevidence.      Nor did the judge err in determining that Caribe's\n\ncoconspirator possessed the gun in connection with the conspiracy.\n\n\n                                       -91-\n\f     5.    Leadership Enhancement (Caribe)\n\n     Caribe next argues that the court erred in increasing his\n\noffense level by three levels after determining that Caribe was a\n\nmanager or supervisor in the organization.                 Section 3B1.1(b)\n\npermits the court to enhance the sentence if \"the defendant was\n\nmanager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the\n\ncriminal    activity   involved   five    or   more    participants   or   was\n\notherwise extensive.\"      The court based its determination on CI\n\nDiaz's testimony about Caribe's role in planning the importation of\n\n700 kilograms of cocaine in the fall of 1997.             For example, Diaz\n\ntestified that Caribe \"controlled all of the beaches and the group\n\nfrom Humacao, including the captain and the boats.\"             Caribe also\n\ntold Diaz that Ortiz, who was supposed to captain the boat that\n\nwould bring the drugs into Puerto Rico, worked for him.           According\n\nto Diaz, Caribe said that \"they [Rivera and Caribe] had the\n\ncaptains, the boats, and the personnel that was needed to carry out\n\nthe job.\"     This evidence is sufficient to support the court's\n\ndetermination.\n\n     6.    Downward Departure Requests (Valle and Nelson)\n\n     The district court denied motions by Valle and Nelson for\n\ndownward departures in their sentences.               Valle argues that the\n\ndistrict judge abused his discretion by failing to depart from the\n\nsentencing guidelines because of a claimed disparity between his\n\nsentence and the sentence of some of his coconspirators.                   The\n\n\n                                   -92-\n\fargument       fails;    a    court    cannot       depart      from    the        sentencing\n\nguidelines in order to correct a disparity between the sentences of\n\ncoconspirators.

Right to Speedy Sentencing\n\n       Caribe claims that his right to a fair trial was violated\n\nbecause of excessive delay in his sentencing. Caribe was convicted\n\non     October    1,     1999.        All    objections         to     the     Presentence\n\nInvestigation Report were submitted by April 25, 2000, but he was\n\nnot sentenced until December 15, 2000.

King, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"380951\"><a href=\"/opinion/380951/raanan-katz-v-patrick-j-king-associate-justice-of-the-housing-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">627</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 576 (1st Cir.\n\n1980); United States v. Rothrock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666883\"><a href=\"/opinion/666883/united-states-v-robert-l-rothrock/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">709</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 711 (7th Cir. 1994).\n\nNo circuit has held that the right to a speedy trial does not apply\n\nat this phase.17\n\n     We assume for the purposes of this appeal that the right to a\n\nspeedy trial extends to sentencing.      We analyze the defendant's\n\nclaim under the four factors that the Supreme Court set out in\n\nBarker v. Wingo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108590\"><a href=\"/opinion/108590/barker-v-wingo/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 530 (1972):       the length of the\n\ndelay; the reason for the delay; the defendant's assertion of his\n\nright; and prejudice to the defendant.    None of these factors is a\n\nnecessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation\n\n\n     17\n         A judge is also required under Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(a) to\nsentence a defendant \"without unnecessary delay.\" Caribe has not\nargued that the delay in his case violated this rule, and therefore\nwe do not address whether he would have a possible claim\nthereunder.\n\n                                -94-\n\fof the right to a speedy sentencing.    See id. at 533.\n\n     Applying these factors to the case at hand, we conclude that\n\nany right to speedy sentencing was not violated.        A fourteen-month\n\ndelay between the date of conviction and the date of sentencing is\n\nlong enough to trigger an inquiry into the other Barker factors.\n\nSee Perez v. Sullivan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471701\"><a href=\"/opinion/471701/filimon-castillo-perez-v-george-e-sullivan-warden-and-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 254 (10th Cir. 1986) (finding\n\na fifteen-month delay long enough to provoke an inquiry into the\n\nremaining three factors); see also Barker, 407 U.S. at 530 (\"Until\n\nthere is some delay which is presumptively prejudicial, there is no\n\nnecessity for inquiry into the other factors that go into the\n\nbalance\"); Katz, 627 F.2d at 577 (finding that a four-month delay\n\nis   \"not   unreasonable   and   certainly   not   of    constitutional\n\ndimensions\").\n\n     Caribe does not make a persuasive showing on any of the other\n\nfactors.    It took approximately seven months for the probation\n\nofficer to complete the presentence report and for the parties to\n\nsubmit their objections.    This time was not excessive given the\n\nlength of the trial, the number of defendants, and the complexity\n\nof the evidence, and indeed Caribe has not challenged this portion\n\nof the delay.     Much of the later delay can be attributed to\n\nCaribe's own motions.   He filed a series of motions to continue his\n\nsentencing: the first such motions were filed on December 17, 1999\n\nand February 1, 2000 and were denied on January 13, 2000 and\n\nFebruary 4, 2000, respectively; the court acceded to later requests\n\n\n                                 -95-\n\ffrom Caribe's counsel to postpone the sentencing, which had been\n\nscheduled for February 25, 2000; the court eventually denied\n\nCaribe's December 6, 2000 motion to continue his sentencing on\n\nDecember 13, 2000 and sentenced Caribe on December 15, 2000.\n\nCaribe also filed a motion for a new trial, which the court denied\n\non December 15, 2000.\n\n     Finally,    and   most    importantly,     Caribe    has    not   shown   he\n\nsuffered any prejudice as a result of the fourteen-month delay. The\n\nprejudice resulting from a delay between indictment and trial is\n\nobvious: the accused must live with the anxiety and concern of\n\nfacing trial; he may have to spend an extended length of time in\n\ncustody; and his defense may be impaired if witnesses' memories\n\nfade.   However, \"[m]ost of those interests diminish or disappear\n\naltogether once there has been a conviction.\"             Perez, 793 F.2d at\n\n256. Thus, the courts have great reluctance to find a speedy trial\n\ndeprivation   where    there    is   no     substantial    and    demonstrable\n\nprejudice.      Id.    Caribe argues that the delay made it more\n\ndifficult for him to challenge the contested factual allegations in\n\nthe presentence report, but he does not explain which allegations\n\nor how he was prejudiced.       He also claims that the delay gave the\n\ngovernment more time to persuade the probation officer to include\n\nunwarranted   enhancements      in   the    presentence     report,     but    as\n\ndiscussed below, Caribe was not prejudiced by these communications.\n\nCaribe may have been anxious about the length of the sentence the\n\n\n                                     -96-\n\fjudge would impose, but such anxiety is present in every sentencing\n\nand cannot be sufficient to meet the prejudice requirement.\n\n     2.   Ex Parte Communications Between Prosecution and Probation\n          Officer\n\n     Caribe also argues that the prosecution violated Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 32(b)(6)(B) by having ex parte communications with the probation\n\nofficer who wrote the presentence report.       Caribe apparently wants\n\nthis court to eliminate the two enhancements added to his offense\n\nlevel and remand the case to the district judge for re-sentencing.\n\nRule 32(b)(6)(B) provides:\n\n     Within 14 days after receiving the presentence report, the\n     parties shall communicate in writing to the probation officer,\n     and to each other, any objections to any material information,\n     sentencing classifications, sentencing guideline ranges, and\n     policy statements contained in or omitted from the presentence\n     report. After receiving objections, the probation officer may\n     meet with the defendant, the defendant's counsel, and the\n     attorney for the Government to discuss those objections. The\n     probation officer may also conduct a further investigation and\n     revise the presentence report as appropriate.\n\n\nThe probation officer issued her initial presentence report to both\n\nparties on February 3, 2000.       This report did not recommend an\n\nenhancement for Caribe's leadership role in the conspiracy or\n\npossession of a gun during the conspiracy.         Caribe alleges that\n\nAgent Plichta then met with the probation officer and reviewed the\n\nevidence about Caribe's role in the conspiracy.            The probation\n\nofficer   then   amended   her   report   to   recommend   a   four-level\n\nenhancement for a leadership role and a two-level enhancement for\n\nfirearm possession.    Caribe's counsel was not given a chance to\n\n                                  -97-\n\frebut Agent Plichta's statements before the amended report was\n\nreleased, although he was able to file formal objections pursuant\n\nto Rule 32 and to raise his objections directly to the district\n\ncourt during     the    sentencing    hearing.      Caribe    filed    a    motion\n\nobjecting to the ex parte communications and demanding disclosure\n\nof all documents that the probation officer used in preparing the\n\npresentence report.       The defendant also asked to be able to call\n\nthe probation officer as a witness at the sentencing hearing to\n\nexamine the extent of the communications.\n\n     In a published opinion, United States v. Caribe Garcia, 125 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 19 (D.P.R. 2000), the district judge denied the motion.\n\nThe court held that there was no prosecutorial misconduct because\n\n\"disclosing     information      to   the    probation   officer      [is]       the\n\nfunctional    equivalent    of   disclosing      information    to    the    court\n\nitself.\"     Id. at 21.    The court also stated that Caribe failed to\n\nshow that he was entitled to a downward departure given that the\n\npresentence    report     only   recommends    a   sentence    and    the    final\n\nsentencing determination is made \"after the Court hears arguments\n\nand objections to the presentence report in open court.\"                   Id.   We\n\nagree with the second basis for the court's opinion but not the\n\nfirst.\n\n     The first issue is difficult because of the discrepancy\n\nbetween the fairly formal procedure contemplated by Rule 32 and the\n\nmore informal reality.      It is common for one side to speak with the\n\n\n                                      -98-\n\fprobation officer, either before or after the report is released.\n\nOne district court has stated that, in that court's experience, ex\n\nparte communications between the government and the probation\n\nofficer   preparing        the    report    are    \"appropriate    and   regular.\"\n\nRoccisano v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1486984\"><a href=\"/opinion/1486984/roccisano-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).\n\nBut we could not fully embrace such informality without reading\n\nRule 32(b) out of the Federal Rules; Rule 32(b) does require a more\n\nstructured process, at least in the fourteen-day period following\n\nthe release of the presentence report.\n\n     Rule     32(b)    is    literally       read    as   permitting     ex    parte\n\ncommunications initiated by either party both before and after this\n\nfourteen-day period.             During the fourteen-day period, however,\n\nwhile the parties are preparing their written objections to the\n\npresentence report, the parties, under the rule, should communicate\n\nwith the probation officer only in writing, and all communications\n\nmust be disclosed to the other party.                 This reading of the rule\n\npermits most of the present informality, while allowing both sides\n\nto know the scope of the objections.                      See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n32(b)(6)(B)    advisory      committee      notes    to   1994   Amendments     (the\n\nparties should have a \"fair opportunity . . . to review, object to,\n\nand comment upon, the probation officer's report in advance of the\n\nsentencing hearing\").            There are benefits to informality, but the\n\nparties   should      at    least    know   what    issues   are   on    the   table\n\nconcerning the presentence report so they can present counter-\n\n\n                                        -99-\n\farguments if they desire.\n\n     Even if contact with Agent Plichta did inadvertently violate\n\nRule 32, Caribe has failed to show that he has suffered any harm as\n\na result.    First, he does not explain what he hoped to accomplish\n\nby additional discovery or by calling the probation officer to\n\ntestify at the sentencing hearing.         The revised presentence report\n\napparently sets forth the additional evidence the probation officer\n\nrelied upon in amending her recommendations, and all other facts\n\nappear to be undisputed.      Second, as the district court noted, the\n\nreport is only a recommendation to the court; the court is not\n\nbound to accept these recommendations.         The district court in this\n\ncase had notice that the second report was prepared after the\n\nprosecution's alleged ex parte contact and gave Caribe's counsel\n\nample     opportunity    at   sentencing     to   dispute    the   report's\n\nrecommendations.    The court then found that the enhancements were\n\nappropriate and sentenced the defendant accordingly.             Thus Caribe\n\nfails to show what harm he suffered as a result of the ex parte\n\ncommunications.    See, e.g., Montoya, 62 F.3d at 3 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(\"[T]he     sentencing    court   has   ample     power     to   deal   with\n\n[prosecutorial misconduct impacting the judge's sentencing options]\n\nby excluding the tainted transaction from the computation of\n\nrelevant conduct or by departing from the [recommendation].\").\n\n\n\n\n                                  -100-\n\fM.   Conclusion\n\n      We affirm the judgments and the sentences and reject each of\n\nthe defendant's claims, except that we remand, in accordance with\n\nthis opinion, the issue of the term of supervised release for\n\nRodriguez and vacate that aspect only of his sentence. So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -101-\n\f</pre>",
