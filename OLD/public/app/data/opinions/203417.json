Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                   Howard and Selya, Circuit Judges,\n                    and Stafford,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n\n    *\n        Of the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation.\n\f     Randall E. Kromm, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Dina Michael\nChaitowitz, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nthe United States.\n     Joan M. Griffin and Corey A. Salsberg, by appointment of the\ncourt, with whom McDermott, Will & Emery LLP was on brief, for\nAlfred W. Trenkler.\n\n\n                         August 1, 2008\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.      These cross-appeals require us to\n\nexplore poorly understood terrain: the modern configuration and use\n\nof the ancient writ of error coram nobis.              This archeological dig\n\nentails a determination of when and under what circumstances that\n\nwrit may be used by a criminal defendant as a vehicle for securing\n\npost-conviction relief.\n\n           The context is as follows.             The petitioner, Alfred W.\n\nTrenkler, is a prison inmate, currently serving a federal sentence.\n\nHe confronted the district court with a claim that more than ten\n\nyears earlier it had illegally sentenced him to life imprisonment.\n\nPersuaded by this claim, the district court granted a writ of error\n\ncoram nobis, vacated the original sentence, and proceeded to\n\nresentence the petitioner to a term of years.                    The government\n\nprotests this deployment of the writ, contending that the district\n\ncourt lacked jurisdiction to issue it.                 The petitioner cross-\n\nappeals, maintaining that even the substituted sentence exceeded\n\nthe   maximum   available    under    the    statutes      of     conviction.\n\n           After   first    grappling      with    a    series    of   threshold\n\nchallenges to our appellate jurisdiction, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court had no authority to issue a writ of error coram\n\nnobis.    Consequently, we reverse the order granting the writ and\n\ndirect the district court to reinstate the original sentence.1\n\n\n      1\n      The parties have also cross-appealed from the amended\njudgment in the resentencing phase of the criminal case.     The\nresult that we reach renders those appeals (Nos. 07-1676 and 07-\n\n                                     -3-\n\fI. BACKGROUND\n\n            We rehearse here only those facts that are needed to\n\nplace these cross-appeals into perspective. We urge the reader who\n\nhungers for more exegetic detail to consult our earlier opinions\n\ndescribing the various way stations that dot the trail of the\n\npetitioner's case.   See, e.g., Trenkler v. United States (Trenkler\n\nIII), 268 F.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2001) (affirming denial of relief under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2255); United States v. Trenkler (Trenkler II), No. 97-\n\n1239, 1998 WL 10265 (1st Cir. Jan. 6, 1998) (affirming denial of\n\nRule 33 motion); United States v. Trenkler (Trenkler I), 61 F.3d 45\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (affirming conviction and sentence on direct\n\nreview); see also Trenkler v. Pugh (Trenkler IV), 83 Fed. Appx. 468\n\n(3d Cir. 2003) (upholding denial of relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2241).\n\n            On November 29, 1993, a jury convicted the petitioner of\n\nconspiracy, 18 U.S.C. § 371, and the illegal receipt and use of\n\nexplosives, id. §§ 844(d), 844(i).     The charges arose out of the\n\npetitioner's role in a bombing that caused the death of one Boston\n\npolice officer and the maiming of another.   See Trenkler I, 61 F.3d\n\nat 47-48.     The district court sentenced the petitioner to 60\n\nmonths' imprisonment on the conspiracy count and life imprisonment\n\non each of the two \"explosives\" counts.   All of the sentences were\n\nto run concurrently.\n\n\n1677) superfluous. Each of them will, therefore, be disposed of\nsummarily by separate order entered contemporaneously with the\nfiling of this opinion.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f            On the date that the indictment was handed up, both\n\nsections 844(d) and 844(i) provided in pertinent part that\n\n            if death results to any person, including any\n            public safety officer performing duties as a\n            direct   or   proximate  result   of   conduct\n            prohibited by this subsection, [the defendant]\n            shall [also] be subject to imprisonment for\n            any term of years, or to the death penalty or\n            to life imprisonment as provided in section 34\n            of this title.\n\nSection 34 provided in turn that when any of the proscribed acts\n\n\"resulted in the death of any person,\" the death penalty or life\n\nimprisonment would be available as a punishment \"if the jury shall\n\nin its discretion so direct.\"     Notwithstanding this language, no\n\nspecial jury finding was either requested or obtained in the\n\npetitioner's case.    Indeed, the anomaly went unremarked.\n\n            Following the imposition of sentence, the petitioner\n\nappealed.    His appeal challenged a number of evidentiary rulings.\n\nSee Trenkler I, 61 F.3d at 51-62.   We rejected all but one of these\n\nchallenges, found that the successful challenge embodied a harmless\n\nerror, and affirmed the judgment below.    Id.\n\n            The next ten years witnessed a kaleidoscopic array of\n\npost-conviction proceedings.    On December 22, 1995, the petitioner\n\nmoved for a new trial or in the alternative an evidentiary hearing\n\non the ground of newly discovered evidence.       Agreeing that the\n\nproffered evidence was not newly discovered, we affirmed the\n\ndistrict court's denial of the motion. Trenkler II, 1998 WL 10265,\n\nat *4.   The district court and this court subsequently rejected as\n\n                                 -5-\n\ftime-barred an application, brought under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, that\n\nalleged ineffective assistance of counsel.       See Trenkler III, 268\n\nF.3d at 27.   The petitioner's other efforts met a similar fate.\n\nSee, e.g., Trenkler IV, 83 Fed. Appx. at 472.\n\n           On August 24, 2004, the petitioner sought a writ of\n\nmandamus in this court, claiming for the first time that 18 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 844(d) and 844(i) required specific jury authorization as a\n\ncondition precedent to the imposition of a life sentence.              We\n\nsummarily rejected his foray, noting that it amounted to a second\n\nor successive section 2255 petition and, as such, ran afoul of the\n\ngatekeeping provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\n\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214.\n\n           Undeterred by this setback, the petitioner wrote to the\n\noriginal trial judge, making essentially the same argument.           The\n\ndistrict   court   appointed   counsel   and,   on   November   6,   2006,\n\nappointed counsel moved for the issuance of a writ of error coram\n\nnobis or in the alternative a writ of audita querela.2          Although\n\n\n     2\n      A writ of error coram nobis is a common-law writ through\nwhich a rendering court, subject to certain conditions, may correct\nits own judgment on the basis of some patent error affecting the\nvalidity or regularity of that judgment.       The writ of audita\nquerela, introduced during the reign of Edward III, is sometimes\navailable to reopen a judgment when an important matter concerning\na defendant's case has arisen since the entry of the judgment. It\nis said that coram nobis is distinguished from audita querela in\nthat the former attacks the judgment itself whereas the latter is\ndirected against the enforcement of the judgment. See 7A C.J.S.\nAudita Querela § 2, at 901 (1980). For present purposes, there is\nno material difference between the two ancient writs. Thus, we\nrefer herein only to the writ of error coram nobis.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fthe petitioner used the docket number of the original criminal\n\ncase, the district court treated the filing as constituting a new\n\ncivil action and assigned a new docket number to it.                The court\n\nreasoned that coram nobis, like its habeas corpus counterpart, is\n\ncivil in nature.\n\n           The court ordered the government to respond by January 5,\n\n2007.    That    date   came   and   went    without   any   word   from   the\n\ngovernment.     Acting sua sponte, the court extended the time for\n\nfiling an opposition to February 2, 2007. It simultaneously warned\n\nthat, should no opposition be filed within the extended period, it\n\nwould decide the matter without the government's participation.\n\nThat deadline, too, expired without any action by the government.\n\n           On February 20, 2007, the district court granted a writ\n\nof error coram nobis.     Trenkler v. United States (Trenkler V), No.\n\n06-12072, 2007 WL 551620, at *1 (D. Mass. Feb. 20, 2007).                  The\n\ncourt asserted jurisdiction under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1651, and expressed the view that the writ was available in\n\ncriminal proceedings to correct fundamental errors, as long as\n\nother remedies were unavailable.           Trenkler V, 2007 WL 551620, at\n\n*3.   It then explained why it thought that the petitioner's claim\n\nwarranted such extraordinary relief.\n\n           To begin, the court concluded that the express language\n\nof the statutes of conviction required a jury directive as a\n\ncondition precedent to the imposition of a life sentence.              Id. at\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f*1.   It noted that the petitioner's life sentence had been imposed\n\nin the absence of such a directive and was, therefore, illegal.\n\nId.    This bevue warranted coram nobis relief because it was\n\n\"fundamental to the validity of the judgment,\" id. at *4, and\n\ncoram nobis represented the only procedural mechanism that remained\n\navailable to correct the sentence, id. at *2.               In reaching this\n\nconclusion, the court conceded that the time had expired for filing\n\na section 2255 petition, see 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f), but suggested\n\nthat the petitioner could not be faulted for failing to seek relief\n\nearlier since all concerned — the court, the government, and the\n\npetitioner's previous counsel — had been caught flat-footed by this\n\nsentencing limitation.        See Trenkler V, 2007 WL 551620, at *5.\n\n           When   all   was    said   and   done,   the   court    vacated   the\n\npetitioner's two concurrent life sentences and set the criminal\n\ncase down for resentencing on April 4, 2007.              The day after the\n\ncourt's order issued, the government moved for leave to file an\n\nopposition to the coram nobis petition, blaming its failure to\n\nrespond in a timely manner on \"institutional inadvertence.\"                  The\n\ndistrict court granted the government's request.              The government\n\nnot only filed an opposition but also moved for reconsideration of\n\nthe coram nobis order.        See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).          In subsequent\n\nfilings, it asserted among other things that the district court\n\nlacked jurisdiction to issue the writ because the petitioner's\n\nrequest was merely a camouflaged section 2255 petition and, as\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fsuch, was subject to AEDPA's limitations on second and successive\n\nhabeas petitions.   It also claimed that coram nobis relief was\n\ninappropriate because the petitioner was still in custody, because\n\nhe had failed to establish a fundamental error in the criminal\n\nproceedings, and because he had failed to prove any good cause for\n\nnot raising the alleged sentencing error at an earlier time.\n\n          On April 4, 2007, the district court, ruling from the\n\nbench, dismissed the government's objections and reaffirmed the\n\nappropriateness of coram nobis relief.    When the district court\n\nproceeded to the criminal case, the petitioner argued that the\n\ndoctrine of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000),\n\nlimited the length of an incarcerative sentence on the affected\n\ncounts to ten years. The court rejected that argument and imposed\n\nconcurrent sentences of 37 years' immurement on the two affected\n\ncounts (crediting the petitioner with time served to that point).\n\n          On April 9, 2007, the court entered an amended judgment\n\nin the criminal case, memorializing the new sentence.   Three days\n\nlater, the court entered a final judgment in the separate coram\n\nnobis proceeding, memorializing the grant of the writ and the\n\nannulment of the original sentence.   On April 17, the government\n\nappealed from the final judgment in the coram nobis proceeding and,\n\nthe next day, appealed from the amended final judgment in the\n\ncriminal case. On April 26, the petitioner filed notices of appeal\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fin both the civil and criminal cases.3 Although these appeals were\n\nconsolidated for briefing and argument in this court, we need look\n\nno further than the cross-appeals in the coram nobis proceeding.\n\nSee supra note 1.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           The focal point of our analysis is the government's\n\nassertion that the district court lacked authority to issue a writ\n\nof error coram nobis.    There is, however, a logically antecedent\n\nissue: the petitioner's suggestion that we have no jurisdiction to\n\nreview the order granting coram nobis relief.        We start there.\n\n                    A.   Appellate Jurisdiction.\n\n           The judgment in the coram nobis proceeding, on its face,\n\nseems final and appealable.       It leaves nothing to be done but the\n\nexecution of the judgment itself.         Catlin v. United States, 324\n\nU.S. 229, 233 (1945); United States v. Metro. Dist. Comm'n, 847 F.\n\n2d 12, 14 (1st Cir. 1988).      The petitioner demurs.    In this regard,\n\nhis most loudly bruited claim is that a grant of coram nobis\n\nconstitutes an unreviewable act of judicial discretion.\n\n           The petitioner's sole support for this proposition is\n\nfragmentary   language   from    an   obscure   Supreme   Court   opinion,\n\n\n      3\n      Citing concerns about treating the writ of error coram nobis\nas an independent civil action, the petitioner moved in the\ndistrict court for the coram nobis order to be entered in the\ncriminal case, rather than entered separately. Although expressing\nsome sympathy for the petitioner's position, the district court\nruled that, due to the government's earlier notice of appeal, it\nlacked jurisdiction to reenter the order.\n\n                                   -10-\n\fPickett's Heirs v. Legerwood, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 144, 148 (1833).\n\nThat case, which dates back to the early nineteenth century,\n\ninvolved a trial court's issuance of what amounted to a writ of\n\nerror coram nobis4 in an action for trespass and ejectment.     The\n\nJustices concluded that this interlocutory order could not be\n\nreviewed by the Supreme Court.   Id. at 148-49 (explaining that the\n\nremedy was \"not one of those remedies over which\" the Court was\n\ngiven \"supervising power . . . by law\").\n\n           Ordinarily, an inferior federal court is bound by the\n\nholdings of the Supreme Court.   McCoy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech., 950\n\nF.2d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 1991).     Here, however, it is doubtful that\n\nPickett's Heirs has any precedential force beyond its specific\n\nfacts.    The Court there explicitly admonished that it was not\n\n\"called upon to decide\" whether the case before it \"was a case\n\nproper for the application of [the coram nobis] remedy.\"    32 U.S.\n\nat 147.    That very question lies at the heart of the instant\n\nmatter, as the government contends that, in the circumstances of\n\nthis case, AEDPA's gatekeeping provisions foreclose any resort to\n\ncoram nobis.    We therefore do not regard Pickett's Heirs as\n\ncontradicting the general proposition that coram nobis orders are\n\nappealable.\n\n\n     4\n      While the Court referred to the technically distinct writ of\nerror coram vobis, see Pickett's Heirs, 32 U.S. at 146, the\ndistinction between coram nobis and coram vobis is \"virtually\nmeaningless\" in the American courts, United States v. Sawyer, 239\nF.3d 31, 37 n.4 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                 -11-\n\f            This    conclusion     is    reinforced       by   modern    appellate\n\npractice.       A canvass of the decisional law reveals that, in the\n\nmore recent cases, coram nobis orders routinely have been reviewed\n\nby federal appellate courts.         See, e.g., United States v. Sawyer,\n\n239 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Keane, 852 F.2d\n\n199, 200 (7th Cir. 1988).          The Supreme Court itself has asserted\n\nappellate jurisdiction in a case like this one, that is, a case\n\nquestioning the trial court's power to issue a writ of error coram\n\nnobis.    See United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502, 513 (1954). And,\n\nfinally, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure contemplate that\n\ncoram nobis orders may be appealed as a matter of course.                 See Fed.\n\nR. App. P. 4(a)(1)(C) (\"An appeal from an order granting or denying\n\nan application for a writ of error coram nobis is an appeal in a\n\ncivil case for purposes of Rule 4(a).\").              That rule has the force\n\nof law.    See Local Union No. 38 v. Custom Air Sys., 333 F.3d 345,\n\n348 (2d Cir. 2003).\n\n            History furnishes a simple means for reconciling whatever\n\nconflict    a    jaundiced   eye   might       perceive   between   the    curious\n\nlanguage in Pickett's Heirs and modern appellate practice. Coram\n\nnobis, in its present incarnation, bears little resemblance to the\n\nwrit as it existed in the early nineteenth century.                     We briefly\n\ntrace its evolution.\n\n            The writ of error coram nobis originated in sixteenth-\n\ncentury England as an instrument used by trial courts to correct\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\ftheir own fact-based errors.   See Carlisle v. United States, 517\n\nU.S. 416, 428-29 (1996); United States v. Mayer, 235 U.S. 55, 68\n\n(1914); see also 7 LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure § 28.1(c), at\n\n143 (3d ed. 2007).    For the most part, its use was confined to\n\ncivil cases.   See, e.g., 7 LaFave et al., supra § 28.1(c), at 143;\n\nLester B. Orfield, The Writ of Error Coram Nobis in Civil Practice,\n\n20 Va. L. Rev. 423, 427 (1934).    But, in time the tectonic plates\n\nshifted and the utility of the writ expanded.     It eventually grew\n\nbeyond the correction of mistakes of fact and became flexible\n\nenough to reach fundamental legal errors.    See Morgan, 346 U.S. at\n\n507-08; Mayer, 235 U.S. at 68; see also 3 Wright, King & Klein,\n\nFederal Practice & Procedure § 592, at 687 (3d ed. 2004).\n\n          As the writ of error coram nobis morphed to encompass\n\nmore than exclusively \"factual\" mistakes, it also began to gain a\n\nfoothold in the criminal docket.   See Sawyer, 239 F.3d at 37.   This\n\ntransmogrification occurred in a leisurely fashion; the writ was\n\nnot readily deployed in state criminal cases until well after the\n\nSupreme Court decided Pickett's Heirs.      See Abraham L. Freedman,\n\nThe Writ of Error Coram Nobis, 3 Temp. L.Q. 365, 373 (1929)\n\n(placing in the late nineteenth century \"the first criminal case of\n\nconsequence in which the writ was successfully employed\").       The\n\nwrit's migration to criminal cases in the federal courts was even\n\nslower; as late as 1914, the Supreme Court pointedly left open the\n\nquestion of the writ's availability in criminal cases.    See Mayer,\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f235 U.S. at 69.      Not until 1954 was the legitimacy of the writ's\n\nuse in criminal cases confirmed by the Court.            See Morgan, 346 U.S.\n\nat 512.\n\n            We now have come full circle: in the modern federal\n\nsystem, use of the writ of error coram nobis is confined to\n\ncriminal cases.      See id. at 505 n.4; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(e)\n\n(abolishing    the    writ    in   civil      cases).     To    complete     this\n\ntransformation, in criminal cases the writ has been seen more and\n\nmore as a means to challenge law-based errors.            See, e.g., Sawyer,\n\n239 F.3d at 37-38; United States v. Tucor Int'l, Inc., 189 F.3d\n\n834, 836 n.1 (9th Cir. 1999); United States v. Rankin, 1 F. Supp.\n\n2d 445, 453 (E.D. Pa. 1998).\n\n            Viewed against this historical backdrop, whatever the\n\nPickett's   Heirs     Court    meant    when    it   stated    that   it   lacked\n\n\"supervising power\" over a grant of coram nobis relief, that\n\nstatement is now an anachronism.               Nearly two hundred years of\n\ndoctrinal development have sapped it of any contemporary vitality.\n\n            The petitioner has a fallback position.             He asseverates\n\nthat even if the grant or denial of a writ of error coram nobis is\n\ndeemed reviewable, the government lacks statutory authority to\n\nappeal such an order.        This asseveration has a certain superficial\n\nallure. After all, the government can mount an appeal in a criminal\n\ncase only in accordance with some express statutory authorization.\n\nUnited States v. Sanges, 144 U.S. 310, 312 (1892); United States v.\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fWatson, 386 F.3d 304, 307 (1st Cir. 2004); United States v. Horn,\n\n29 F.3d 754, 768 (1st Cir. 1994); see 15B Wright, Miller & Cooper,\n\nFederal Practice & Procedure § 3919.1, at 598 (2d ed. 1991).\n\n          Close   perscrutation    discloses   that   the   petitioner's\n\nasseveration rests on a flimsy foundation: the dubious proposition\n\nthat a writ of error coram nobis is part of the warp and woof of a\n\ncriminal proceeding, subject to this traditional limitation on\n\ngovernment appeals.    To support that proposition, he cherry-picks\n\na snippet in which the Morgan Court characterized the writ of error\n\ncoram nobis as a \"step in the criminal case and not, like habeas\n\ncorpus where relief is sought in a separate case and record, the\n\nbeginning of a separate civil proceeding.\"       346 U.S. at 505 n.4.\n\nIn our view, Morgan's footnote 4 cannot bear the heavy weight that\n\nthe petitioner piles upon it.\n\n          As an initial matter, the import of the footnote is\n\ntenebrous; the very next line of the footnote asserts that coram\n\nnobis \"is of the same general character as [proceedings] under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255.\"       Id.   Section 2255 proceedings, like classic\n\npetitions for habeas corpus, are generally treated as civil in\n\nnature. See Heflin v. United States, 358 U.S. 415, 418 n.7 (1959);\n\nRogers v. United States, 180 F.3d 349, 352 n.3 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          In all events, the reach of Morgan's footnote 4 is more\n\ncircumscribed than the petitioner suggests.           As Judge Friendly\n\nobserved when facing a similarly ambitious construction of the\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fMorgan footnote, the quoted language does not purport to dictate\n\nthat coram nobis petitions must be treated as strictly criminal for\n\npurposes of appeal or otherwise.         United States v. Keogh, 391 F.2d\n\n138, 140 (2d Cir. 1968).        Rather, the Morgan Court was confronted\n\nwith, and resolved, a much narrower problem: whether the writ could\n\nbe deployed to correct errors in criminal cases notwithstanding the\n\npromulgation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) (which\n\nabolished coram nobis in \"suits of a civil nature\").               See Morgan,\n\n346 U.S. at 505 n.4.   Judge Friendly found no reason to think that,\n\nin affirmatively answering this narrow question, the Morgan Court\n\nintended to determine that coram nobis orders should be treated as\n\ncriminal for all purposes.        Keogh, 391 F.2d at 140.\n\n           Like Judge Friendly, we decline to read the quoted\n\nsnippet as extending beyond the question that the Morgan Court was\n\nendeavoring to answer.          In taking this commonsense approach to\n\nMorgan's   footnote   4,   we    join   several   other   courts    that   have\n\nfollowed Judge Friendly's lead. See, e.g., United States v. Craig,\n\n907 F.2d 653, 656-57 (7th Cir. 1990); United States v. Cooper, 876\n\nF.2d 1192, 1194 (5th Cir. 1989); United States v. Balistrieri, 606\n\nF.2d 216, 220-21 (7th Cir. 1979); see also Fed. R. App. P.\n\n4(a)(1)(C) & advisory committee notes.\n\n           Of course, this leaves an unanswered question: Should\n\ncoram nobis be treated as civil or criminal for purposes of appeal?\n\nThe answer to that question cannot be gleaned by grasping at\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fconvenient labels.   While the modern writ of error coram nobis is\n\nused in criminal cases, its character necessarily reflects the\n\nvestiges of its origins in civil litigation.      Accordingly, many\n\ncourts have treated coram nobis as civil for a variety of purposes,\n\nsuch as the availability of discovery, see, e.g., Balistrieri, 606\n\nF.2d at 221, and the temporal limits for filing notices of appeal,\n\nsee, e.g., Keogh, 391 F.2d at 140.    Given the lessons of history,\n\nwe are convinced that coram nobis proceedings are best seen as\n\nhybrids — quasi-civil and quasi-criminal.    See Craig, 907 F.2d at\n\n656; Mercado v. United States, 183 F.2d 486, 487 (1st Cir. 1950).\n\nOn this view, the denomination of the nature of a given petition\n\ncalls for a functional analysis rather than for doctrinal rigidity.\n\n          We see no reason here to apply the more restrictive rules\n\ngoverning criminal appeals to the government's appeal in a coram\n\nnobis proceeding (even though that proceeding is ancillary to a\n\ncriminal case).   The traditional restrictions on the government's\n\nright to appeal stem primarily from double jeopardy concerns.   See\n\nKepner v. United States, 195 U.S. 100, 133 (1904).    Such concerns\n\nare far less weighty when dealing with collateral challenges to\n\ncriminal convictions.   See 15B Wright, Miller & Cooper, supra §\n\n3919.9, at 732 (\"There is less need to restrict government appeal\n\nopportunities in proceedings that come . . . after the formal\n\nprosecution.\"). Consequently, we hold that coram nobis proceedings\n\nare appealable as civil matters.      Thus the government, like any\n\n\n                               -17-\n\fother party, may appeal the grant or denial of the writ as a final\n\norder under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.      See 15B Wright, Miller & Cooper,\n\nsupra § 3919.9, at 740 (positing by analogy to habeas corpus that\n\nthe government \"should be allowed to appeal final disposition of\n\ncoram nobis proceedings\"); see also Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(C).\n\n          The petitioner has one last arrow in his jurisdictional\n\nquiver. He contends that even if we find appellate jurisdiction in\n\ntheory, the government's appeal here is time-barred.        Once again,\n\nthis   contention    derives   from     the   Morgan   Court's   cryptic\n\ncharacterization of coram nobis as a \"step in the criminal case.\"\n\n346 U.S. at 505 n.4.      On that premise, the petitioner concludes\n\nthat the government was subject to the 30-day filing deadline\n\napplicable to government appeals in criminal cases, Fed. R. App. P.\n\n4(b)(1)(B); that the 30-day period ran from February 20, 2007 (when\n\nthe district court announced its decision to grant the writ); and\n\nthat, therefore, the government's notice of appeal, filed in mid-\n\nApril, was late.\n\n          This plaint is as insubstantial as a house built upon the\n\nshifting sands.     The short answer to it is that the Federal Rules\n\nof Appellate Procedure explicitly provide that \"[a]n appeal from an\n\norder granting or denying an application for a writ of error coram\n\nnobis is an appeal in a civil case\" and, thus, is subject to a 60-\n\nday filing period.     Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(C); see also Fed. R.\n\nApp. P. 4(a)(1)(B). This language was added to the Appellate Rules\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fin 2002 to resolve a conflict in the courts of appeals regarding\n\nthe time limits that applied to appeals from coram nobis orders.\n\nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4 advisory committee notes.          The amended rule\n\ncontrols here.   Accordingly, the government's notice of appeal was\n\ntimely even if, as the petitioner contends, the appeal period ran\n\nfrom February 20, 2007.5\n\n                        B.    AEDPA Preclusion.\n\n           Having confirmed the existence of appellate jurisdiction,\n\nwe turn to the substance of the government's appeal.         Distilled to\n\nits essence, the argument here is that the petition was a wolf in\n\nsheep's clothing: an unapproved second or successive section 2255\n\npetition masquerading as a petition for a writ of error coram\n\nnobis.    Relatedly, the government insists that coram nobis is\n\nunavailable to a prisoner in federal custody.        If these arguments\n\nare   well-founded,   the    district   court   lacked   jurisdiction   to\n\nentertain the petition.\n\n           The petitioner's initial rejoinder is in the nature of a\n\npreemptive strike.    He says that because the government failed to\n\n\n      5\n      Although we need not probe the point, the appeal period does\nnot appear to have run from the February 20 order but, rather, from\nthe later entry of final judgment in the coram nobis proceeding.\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(c)(1); see also Cunningham v. Hamilton\nCounty, 527 U.S. 198, 203 (1999) (\"[W]e have repeatedly interpreted\n[28 U.S.C.] § 1291 to mean that an appeal ordinarily will not lie\nuntil after final judgment has been entered.\"); Mullane v.\nChambers, 333 F.3d 322, 337 (1st Cir. 2003) (observing that until\na \"separate judgment has been 'entered' under [Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure] 58, the time for filing a notice of appeal has not\nyet begun to run\").\n\n                                  -19-\n\frespond to his petition in a timeous fashion, it has waived or\n\nforfeited these arguments.     This strike misfires for two reasons.\n\n           First, each of the government's arguments goes to the\n\ndistrict court's subject-matter jurisdiction.        This is important\n\nbecause parties cannot confer subject-matter jurisdiction on a\n\ndistrict court by sloth or acquiescence.         See United States v.\n\nCotton, 535 U.S. 625, 630 (2002); Espinal-Dominguez v. Puerto Rico,\n\n352 F.3d 490, 495 (1st Cir. 2003); Horn, 29 F.3d at 767-68.\n\n           Second, these arguments were raised, albeit belatedly, in\n\nthe district court.    That court chose not to treat them as waived\n\nbut,   rather,   seemingly   rejected   the   government's   motion   for\n\nreconsideration on the merits (thus effectively rejecting the\n\npreclusion argument contained therein).       The court made no comment\n\nabout the timeliness vel non of the government's proffer.       Where a\n\ntrial court chooses to overlook the belated nature of a filing and\n\nadjudicate the tardy claim or defense on the merits, that claim or\n\ndefense may be deemed preserved for purposes of appellate review.\n\nSee Negrón-Almeda v. Santiago, 528 F.3d 15, 26 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           This brings us to the post-AEDPA framework for collateral\n\nreview.   The writ of habeas corpus historically has served as the\n\nprincipal vehicle for testing the legality of executive detentions.\n\nAttempting to address \"practical problems that had arisen in the\n\nadministration of the federal courts' habeas corpus jurisdiction,\"\n\nUnited States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 210 (1952), Congress enacted\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\f28 U.S.C. § 2255 as a substitute for the traditional habeas remedy\n\nwith respect to federal prisoners.                See Act of June 25, 1948, 62\n\nStat. 967.        This \"virtual habeas\" statute supplies a remedy that\n\nbears a strong family resemblance to the traditional writ of habeas\n\ncorpus.         The statute was intended to provide a federal prisoner\n\nwith       an   exclusive   means   of    challenging    the    validity    of   his\n\nconviction or sentence, save only in those few instances in which\n\nthe statutory remedy proved \"inadequate or ineffective to test the\n\nlegality of his detention.\"           28 U.S.C. § 2255(e).         In this context,\n\n\"inadequate or ineffective\" requires an ex ante appraisal.                    Taylor\n\nv. Gilkey, 314 F.3d 832, 835-36 (7th Cir. 2002) (collecting cases).\n\n                In 1996, Congress enacted AEDPA.             That statute imposed\n\nsignificant new constraints on proceedings under section 2255.6\n\nSome       of   these   constraints   were       temporal;   for   example,   AEDPA\n\nestablished a one-year statute of limitations for filing a section\n\n2255 petition.          28 U.S.C. § 2255(f).         Some of these constraints\n\nwere numerical; for example, AEDPA required a federal prisoner who\n\nsought to prosecute a second or successive section 2255 petition to\n\nobtain pre-clearance, in the form of a certificate, from the court\n\nof appeals.        Id. § 2255(h).        By the terms of the statute, such a\n\ncertificate will be made available only if the prisoner can show\n\n\n       6\n      AEDPA also imposed substantially similar constraints on\nfederal habeas petitions involving state prisoners. See e.g., 28\nU.S.C. § 2244(b) (restricting second or successive petitions for\nsection 2254 petitions); § 2244(d) (establishing 1-year statute of\nlimitations for section 2254 motions).\n\n                                          -21-\n\fthat the proposed second or successive petition is based either on\n\nnewly discovered evidence or a new rule of constitutional law. Id.\n\nWe have interpreted this provision as \"stripping the district court\n\nof jurisdiction over a second or successive habeas petition unless\n\nand until the court of appeals has decreed that it may go forward.\"\n\nPratt v. United States, 129 F.3d 54, 57 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n           Although     section       2255,      as   amended,   provides      a\n\ncomprehensive remedial scheme for post-conviction relief, that\n\nscheme perpetuates the savings clause contained in section 2255(e).\n\nMoreover, the Supreme Court has made it pellucid that section 2255\n\ndoes not preempt the entire array of common-law writs authorized\n\nunder the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651.            See Morgan, 346 U.S. at\n\n510-11.    Still, each attempted use of an extraordinary writ in\n\nconnection with post-conviction relief must be judged on its own\n\nmerits.    The strictures of section 2255 cannot be sidestepped by\n\nthe simple expedient of resorting to some more exotic writ.                   Put\n\nbluntly,   the   All   Writs    Act   is   not    a   jujube.    At   most,    it\n\nconstitutes \"a residual source of authority to issue writs that are\n\nnot otherwise covered by statute.\"            Pa. Bureau of Corr. v. U.S.\n\nMarshals Serv., 474 U.S. 34, 43 (1985).\n\n           We think it follows that when a statute — like section\n\n2255 — specifically addresses a particular class of claims or\n\nissues, it is that statute, not the All Writs Act, that takes\n\nprecedence.      See id.       The armamentarium of common-law writs,\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fincluding the writ of error coram nobis, is thus available only to\n\nfill whatever interstices exist in the post-conviction remedial\n\nscheme made available to federal prisoners by way of section 2255.\n\nSee United States v. Ayala, 894 F.2d 425, 428 (D.C. Cir. 1990).\n\n              This gap-filling approach makes it essential for courts\n\nto plot, and then to patrol, the boundaries between section 2255\n\nand the universe of old common-law writs.                       Otherwise, artful\n\npleaders      will   tiptoe     around    those     boundaries        and    frustrate\n\nCongress's     discernible      intent.         See,   e.g.,     United     States    v.\n\nWinestock, 340 F.3d 200, 203 (4th Cir. 2003); cf. Calderon v.\n\nThompson, 523 U.S. 538, 553 (1998) (patrolling boundaries of\n\nsection 2254).       In carrying out this sentry duty, courts must be\n\nguided by the precept that substance trumps form.                     See Rodwell v.\n\nPepe, 324 F.3d 66, 71 (1st Cir. 2003) (predicting that whether\n\nAEDPA's limitations apply \"will depend not on the label affixed to\n\na particular motion but on its essence\").                   Thus, \"[a]ny motion\n\nfiled    in   the    district    court    that    imposed       the   sentence,      and\n\nsubstantively within the scope of § 2255 ¶ 1, is a motion under §\n\n2255, no matter what title the prisoner plasters on the cover.\"\n\nMelton   v.    United     States,   359   F.3d     855,   857     (7th      Cir.   2004)\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n              Following     this    approach,          courts     regularly        have\n\nrecharacterized imaginatively captioned petitions to reflect that\n\nthey derive their essence from section 2255 and, thus, must satisfy\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fthat section's gatekeeping provisions.   See, e.g., Winestock, 340\n\nF.3d at 206-208 (recharacterizing a self-styled Rule 60(b) motion);\n\nUnited States v. Torres, 282 F.3d 1241, 1246 (10th Cir. 2002)\n\n(recharacterizing a self-styled writ of coram nobis); Spivey v.\n\nState Bd. of Pardons and Paroles, 279 F.3d 1301, 1303 (11th Cir.\n\n2002) (recharacterizing a self-styled § 1983 action); Jiminian v.\n\nNash, 245 F.3d 144, 149 (2d Cir. 2001) (recharacterizing a self-\n\nstyled § 2241 petition); Ayala, 894 F.2d at 430 (recharacterizing\n\na so-called writ of audita querela); United States v. Mosquera, 845\n\nF.2d 1122, 1123 n.1 (1st Cir. 1988) (recharacterizing a self-styled\n\nRule 35 motion).\n\n          A close analysis of the substance of the petition in this\n\ncase leaves no doubt but that, regardless of its label, the\n\npetition falls within the compass of section 2255.     On its face,\n\nthe petition is brought on behalf of a federal prisoner still in\n\ncustody and challenges his sentence as unauthorized under the\n\nstatutes of conviction.   This is a classic habeas corpus scenario,\n\nsquarely within the heartland carved out by Congress in section\n\n2255. See 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a) (offering a means of post-conviction\n\nrelief to \"[a] prisoner in custody under sentence of a [federal]\n\ncourt\" who claims \"that [his] sentence was in excess of the maximum\n\nauthorized by law\").   As such, the claim embodied in the petition\n\nis one cognizable in a section 2255 proceeding.      Therefore, the\n\n\n\n\n                               -24-\n\fdistrict court should have recharacterized the petition as a\n\nsection 2255 petition and proceeded accordingly.\n\n           The conclusion that the petition should have been treated\n\nas one arising under section 2255 sounds a death knell for the\n\nproceeding.     The petition was filed more than ten years after the\n\npetitioner's conviction had become final and more than five years\n\nafter an earlier section 2255 petition (itself deemed to be time-\n\nbarred).   No pre-clearance had been either sought or obtained in\n\nthis court.     Consequently, the petition was an unauthorized second\n\nor successive habeas petition and was foreclosed on that basis.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 2255(h); see also United States v. Barrett, 178\n\nF.3d 34, 42-45 (1st Cir. 1999).      Given this reality, the district\n\ncourt had only two choices: either dismiss the recharacterized\n\npetition or transfer it to this court.       See Pratt, 129 F.3d at 57.\n\nEither way, the case was at an end: dismissal would have ended it,\n\nand transferring the recharacterized petition to this court would\n\nhave been an exercise in futility.       After all, the petition was not\n\npremised on either newly discovered evidence or a new rule of\n\nconstitutional law.     See 28 U.S.C. § 2255(h).\n\n           The petitioner attempts to escape the vise-like grip of\n\nAEDPA's gatekeeping provisions by asserting that a writ of error\n\ncoram   nobis    comprises   an   alternative,    and   constitutionally\n\nnecessary, method for challenging an illegal sentence, at least\n\nwhen other means of collateral review have been exhausted.          But\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\fwhere, as here, a petitioner's claim falls within the heartland of\n\nsection 2255, this assertion lacks force. \"The writ of coram nobis\n\nmay not be used to circumvent the clear congressional directive\n\nembodied in the 'second or successive' provisions of § 2255.\"\n\nBarrett, 178 F.3d at 55.\n\n          If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — the writ\n\nof error coram nobis, in its modern form, is ordinarily available\n\nonly to a criminal defendant who is no longer in custody.        See\n\nUnited States v. Esogbue, 357 F.3d 532, 534 (5th Cir. 2004); Obado\n\nv. New Jersey, 328 F.3d 716, 718 (3d Cir. 2003); Torres, 282 F.3d\n\nat 1245; see also 3 Wright, King & Klein, supra § 592, at 689.   The\n\npetitioner's exercise in legal taxonomy therefore fails: the gap-\n\nfilling allowed by the Morgan Court does not permit an inquiring\n\ncourt \"to redefine a common law writ in order to create relief not\n\notherwise available in the federal postconviction remedial scheme.\"\n\nAyala, 894 F.2d at 429 (emphasis in original); accord Doe v. INS,\n\n120 F.3d 200, 203-04 (9th Cir. 1997).\n\n          To be sure, we suggested in Barrett, 178 F.3d at 56, that\n\nthere may be situations in which section 2255 does not completely\n\noccupy the field — but that suggestion was limited to those\n\nsituations in which section 2255's savings clause applies; that is,\n\nthose situations in which the remedy provided by section 2255 is\n\ndeemed \"inadequate or ineffective.\"     Id. (quoting 28 U.S.C. §\n\n\n\n\n                               -26-\n\f2255(e)).     This case does not come within the narrow confines of\n\nthe savings clause.\n\n            As indicated above, section 2255 is both adequate and\n\neffective to address a claim of the type and kind mounted by the\n\npetitioner.    Although the petitioner might now be unable to pursue\n\nthat claim via a second or successive petition because of the\n\ncombination     of   his    own   tardiness   and   AEDPA's   gatekeeping\n\nprovisions, the mere inability to satisfy those requirements does\n\nnot afford access to the savings clause.        See id. at 50.     To rule\n\notherwise   would    reduce   AEDPA's   gatekeeping   provisions    to   \"a\n\nmeaningless gesture.\"       Id.; accord In re Davenport, 147 F.3d 605,\n\n608 (7th Cir. 1998).\n\n            The bottom line is that adequacy and effectiveness must\n\nbe judged ex ante.         Accordingly, post-conviction relief can be\n\ntermed \"inadequate\" or \"ineffective\" only when, in a particular\n\ncase, the configuration of section 2255 is such \"as to deny a\n\nconvicted defendant any opportunity for judicial rectification.\"\n\nIn re Davenport, 147 F.3d at 611 (emphasis in original).\n\n            The record here makes manifest that the petitioner cannot\n\nsatisfy that demanding standard.        He had multiple opportunities to\n\nchallenge the imposition of his life sentences as inconsistent with\n\nthe terms of the statutes of conviction.            His alleged claim of\n\n\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\ferror was available to him on both direct and collateral review;7\n\nand those review modalities, if timely engaged, would have offered\n\nan adequate and effective means of rectifying the error.              That he\n\nneglected    to   avail   himself   of   these   opportunities   in   no   way\n\ndetracts from their adequacy and effectiveness.\n\n            The fact that courts have allowed recourse to the savings\n\nclause in rare and exceptional circumstances, such as those in\n\nwhich strict adherence to AEDPA's gatekeeping provisions would\n\nresult in a \"complete miscarriage of justice,\" In re Dorsainvil,\n\n119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir. 1997), does not help the petitioner.\n\nMost courts have required a credible allegation of actual innocence\n\nto access the savings clause.        See, e.g., Reyes-Requena v. United\n\nStates, 243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir. 2001).          The petitioner's claim\n\ndoes not qualify; his petition does not posit that he is actually\n\ninnocent of the crimes for which he was indicted, convicted, and\n\nsentenced.\n\n            Equally as important, the nature of the petitioner's\n\nclaim of error is incompatible with engagement of the savings\n\nclause.     He does not charge that a life sentence is beyond the\n\nstatutory maximum for the crimes of conviction.          Rather, his claim\n\n\n\n     7\n      By the time the petitioner was indicted, the interpretation\nof the penalty provision on which he now relies had already been\nadopted by at least two federal courts of appeals in published\nopinions. See United States v. Williams, 775 F.2d 1295, 1299 (5th\nCir. 1985); United States v. Hansen, 755 F.2d 629, 631 (8th Cir.\n1985).\n\n                                    -28-\n\fis procedural: that the statutes of conviction required a jury\n\nrecommendation in order to impose a life sentence, and that the\n\njudge, not the jury, made the recommendation in his case.       This\n\nclaim, if true, does not suggest a miscarriage of justice.        We\n\nexplain briefly.\n\n            The Supreme Court has defined the term \"miscarriage of\n\njustice\" as encompassing only those \"extraordinary instances when\n\na constitutional violation probably has caused the conviction of\n\none innocent of the crime.\"    McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 494\n\n(1991).   The petitioner makes no such claim; he does not challenge\n\nthe sufficiency of the evidence upon which the sentencing judge\n\nacted, nor does he suggest that it was likely that a jury would\n\nhave reached a different result.\n\n            Rules that allocate decisionmaking responsibility between\n\njudge and jury are generally thought to be procedural. See Schriro\n\nv. Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348, 353 (2004).    As such, misallocation of\n\nthat responsibility is unlikely to implicate the accuracy or\n\nfundamental fairness of judicial proceedings. See, e.g., Sepulveda\n\nv. United States, 330 F.3d 55, 61 (1st Cir. 2003) (holding, in the\n\nApprendi context, that decisions made by the judge instead of the\n\njury are \"not the sort of error that necessarily undermines the\n\nfairness . . . of judicial proceedings\") (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    Here, the petitioner has given us no reason to suspect\n\nthat the misallocation affected his substantial rights.\n\n\n                                 -29-\n\f           The final shot in the petitioner's sling is that the\n\nright to correct an illegal sentence is a basic right for which the\n\nConstitution guarantees a remedy.                      This platitude has little\n\nutility here.\n\n           It     is    well-established              that     a    criminal    defendant\n\npossesses no general constitutional right to appellate review.\n\nSee, e.g., McKane v. Durston, 153 U.S. 684, 687 (1894); United\n\nStates v. Puzzanghera, 820 F.2d 25, 26-27 (1st Cir. 1987).                            By the\n\nsame token, errors committed at trial, even those of constitutional\n\ndimension,   do    not       invariably           require    reversal.         See,   e.g.,\n\nWashington v. Recuenco, 548 U.S. 212, 218 (2006); see also Neder v.\n\nUnited   States,       527   U.S.     1,      8    (1999)    (explaining       that   \"most\n\nconstitutional     errors       can      be       harmless\")       (quoting    Arizona     v.\n\nFulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 306 (1991)).\n\n           Furthermore         —    as     we      already    have    explained       —   the\n\npetitioner had several opportunities for judicial review.                             If he\n\nfailed to raise a particular claim of error at the appropriate\n\ntime, enforcement of the usual rules of waiver and preclusion\n\nscarcely can be deemed a violation of his constitutional right to\n\nan appeal. Thus we conclude, without serious question, that to the\n\nextent that the Constitution affords a defendant a right to correct\n\nerrors in judicial proceedings through either appellate review or\n\ncollateral attack, that right has not been sullied here.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -30-\n\fIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n            We appreciate the able district judge's desire to correct\n\nan     apparent     error    attributable      to    the    lawyers'     shared\n\nmisperception.        We admire as well the ingenuity displayed by\n\nappointed counsel in attempting to rectify that mistake.                But the\n\nrule of law must remain paramount and, as Lord Campbell warned long\n\nago, hard cases have a propensity to make bad law.                See Burnham v.\n\nGuardian Life Ins. Co., 873 F.2d 486, 487 (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting\n\nUnited    States    v.   Clark,   96   U.S.   37,   49   (1877)    (Harlan,   J.,\n\ndissenting) (quoting Lord Campbell in East Indian Co. v. Paul, 7\n\nMoo. P.C.C. 111)).       That propensity must be held in check.          That is\n\nour obligation here.\n\n            Implicit in the scheme created by AEDPA is the notion\n\nthat certain claims, which might have been fruitful if timely\n\nasserted, may be foreclosed when a convicted defendant sleeps upon\n\nhis rights.       See Dodd v. United States, 545 U.S. 353, 359 (2005);\n\nJamison v. United States, 244 F.3d 44, 47 (1st Cir. 2001).                    That\n\nour criminal justice system tolerates a certain risk of error might\n\nbe of concern to some, but finality is indispensable to the proper\n\nfunctioning of that system. Under AEDPA, there is typically \"only\n\none bite at the post-conviction apple.\"             Barrett, 178 F.3d at 57.\n\nThe petitioner has had that bite.\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nthe order granting the writ of error coram nobis is reversed, the\n\n\n                                       -31-\n\fwrit is quashed, and the case is remanded to the district court\n\nwith directions to vacate the amended judgment in the criminal case\n\nand reinstate the original sentence.\n\n\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -32-\n\f",

These cross-appeals require us to\n\nexplore poorly understood terrain: the modern configuration and use\n\nof the ancient writ of error coram nobis.              This archeological dig\n\nentails a determination of when and under what circumstances that\n\nwrit may be used by a criminal defendant as a vehicle for securing\n\npost-conviction relief.\n\n           The context is as follows.             The petitioner, Alfred W.\n\nTrenkler, is a prison inmate, currently serving a federal sentence.\n\nHe confronted the district court with a claim that more than ten\n\nyears earlier it had illegally sentenced him to life imprisonment.\n\nPersuaded by this claim, the district court granted a writ of error\n\ncoram nobis, vacated the original sentence, and proceeded to\n\nresentence the petitioner to a term of years.                    The government\n\nprotests this deployment of the writ, contending that the district\n\ncourt lacked jurisdiction to issue it.                 The petitioner cross-\n\nappeals, maintaining that even the substituted sentence exceeded\n\nthe   maximum   available    under    the    statutes      of     conviction.\n\n           After   first    grappling      with    a    series    of   threshold\n\nchallenges to our appellate jurisdiction, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court had no authority to issue a writ of error coram\n\nnobis.    Consequently, we reverse the order granting the writ and\n\ndirect the district court to reinstate the original sentence.1\n\n\n      1\n      The parties have also cross-appealed from the amended\njudgment in the resentencing phase of the criminal case.     The\nresult that we reach renders those appeals (Nos. 07-1676 and 07-\n\n                                     -3-\n\fI.

The charges arose out of the\n\npetitioner's role in a bombing that caused the death of one Boston\n\npolice officer and the maiming of another.   See Trenkler I, 61 F.3d\n\nat 47-48.

Indeed, the anomaly went unremarked.\n\n            Following the imposition of sentence, the petitioner\n\nappealed.    His appeal challenged a number of evidentiary rulings.\n\nSee Trenkler I, 61 F.3d at 51-62.   We rejected all but one of these\n\nchallenges, found that the successful challenge embodied a harmless\n\nerror, and affirmed the judgment below.

The district court and this court subsequently rejected as\n\n                                 -5-\n\ftime-barred an application, brought under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, that\n\nalleged ineffective assistance of counsel.       See Trenkler III, 268\n\nF.3d at 27.   The petitioner's other efforts met a similar fate.\n\nSee, e.g., Trenkler IV, 83 Fed. Appx. at 472.\n\n           On August 24, 2004, the petitioner sought a writ of\n\nmandamus in this court, claiming for the first time that 18 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 844(d) and 844(i) required specific jury authorization as a\n\ncondition precedent to the imposition of a life sentence.              We\n\nsummarily rejected his foray, noting that it amounted to a second\n\nor successive section 2255 petition and, as such, ran afoul of the\n\ngatekeeping provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\n\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214.\n\n           Undeterred by this setback, the petitioner wrote to the\n\noriginal trial judge, making essentially the same argument.           The\n\ndistrict   court   appointed   counsel   and,   on   November   6,   2006,\n\nappointed counsel moved for the issuance of a writ of error coram\n\nnobis or in the alternative a writ of audita querela.2          Although\n\n\n     2\n      A writ of error coram nobis is a common-law writ through\nwhich a rendering court, subject to certain conditions, may correct\nits own judgment on the basis of some patent error affecting the\nvalidity or regularity of that judgment.       The writ of audita\nquerela, introduced during the reign of Edward III, is sometimes\navailable to reopen a judgment when an important matter concerning\na defendant's case has arisen since the entry of the judgment. It\nis said that coram nobis is distinguished from audita querela in\nthat the former attacks the judgment itself whereas the latter is\ndirected against the enforcement of the judgment. See 7A C.J.S.\nAudita Querela § 2, at 901 (1980). For present purposes, there is\nno material difference between the two ancient writs. Thus, we\nrefer herein only to the writ of error coram nobis.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fthe petitioner used the docket number of the original criminal\n\ncase, the district court treated the filing as constituting a new\n\ncivil action and assigned a new docket number to it.                The court\n\nreasoned that coram nobis, like its habeas corpus counterpart, is\n\ncivil in nature.\n\n           The court ordered the government to respond by January 5,\n\n2007.    That    date   came   and   went    without   any   word   from   the\n\ngovernment.     Acting sua sponte, the court extended the time for\n\nfiling an opposition to February 2, 2007. It simultaneously warned\n\nthat, should no opposition be filed within the extended period, it\n\nwould decide the matter without the government's participation.\n\nThat deadline, too, expired without any action by the government.\n\n           On February 20, 2007, the district court granted a writ\n\nof error coram nobis.

Mass. Feb. 20, 2007).                  The\n\ncourt asserted jurisdiction under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1651, and expressed the view that the writ was available in\n\ncriminal proceedings to correct fundamental errors, as long as\n\nother remedies were unavailable.           Trenkler V, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">551620</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n\n*3.   It then explained why it thought that the petitioner's claim\n\nwarranted such extraordinary relief.\n\n           To begin, the court concluded that the express language\n\nof the statutes of conviction required a jury directive as a\n\ncondition precedent to the imposition of a life sentence.              Id. at\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f*1.   It noted that the petitioner's life sentence had been imposed\n\nin the absence of such a directive and was, therefore, illegal.\n\nId.    This bevue warranted coram nobis relief because it was\n\n\"fundamental to the validity of the judgment,\" id. at *4, and\n\ncoram nobis represented the only procedural mechanism that remained\n\navailable to correct the sentence, id. at *2.               In reaching this\n\nconclusion, the court conceded that the time had expired for filing\n\na section 2255 petition, see 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f), but suggested\n\nthat the petitioner could not be faulted for failing to seek relief\n\nearlier since all concerned — the court, the government, and the\n\npetitioner's previous counsel — had been caught flat-footed by this\n\nsentencing limitation.        See Trenkler V, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">551620</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5.\n\n           When   all   was    said   and   done,   the   court    vacated   the\n\npetitioner's two concurrent life sentences and set the criminal\n\ncase down for resentencing on April 4, 2007.              The day after the\n\ncourt's order issued, the government moved for leave to file an\n\nopposition to the coram nobis petition, blaming its failure to\n\nrespond in a timely manner on \"institutional inadvertence.\"                  The\n\ndistrict court granted the government's request.              The government\n\nnot only filed an opposition but also moved for reconsideration of\n\nthe coram nobis order.        See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).          In subsequent\n\nfilings, it asserted among other things that the district court\n\nlacked jurisdiction to issue the writ because the petitioner's\n\nrequest was merely a camouflaged section 2255 petition and, as\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fsuch, was subject to AEDPA's limitations on second and successive\n\nhabeas petitions.   It also claimed that coram nobis relief was\n\ninappropriate because the petitioner was still in custody, because\n\nhe had failed to establish a fundamental error in the criminal\n\nproceedings, and because he had failed to prove any good cause for\n\nnot raising the alleged sentencing error at an earlier time.\n\n          On April 4, 2007, the district court, ruling from the\n\nbench, dismissed the government's objections and reaffirmed the\n\nappropriateness of coram nobis relief.    When the district court\n\nproceeded to the criminal case, the petitioner argued that the\n\ndoctrine of Apprendi v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 490 (2000),\n\nlimited the length of an incarcerative sentence on the affected\n\ncounts to ten years. The court rejected that argument and imposed\n\nconcurrent sentences of 37 years' immurement on the two affected\n\ncounts (crediting the petitioner with time served to that point).\n\n          On April 9, 2007, the court entered an amended judgment\n\nin the criminal case, memorializing the new sentence.   Three days\n\nlater, the court entered a final judgment in the separate coram\n\nnobis proceeding, memorializing the grant of the writ and the\n\nannulment of the original sentence.   On April 17, the government\n\nappealed from the final judgment in the coram nobis proceeding and,\n\nthe next day, appealed from the amended final judgment in the\n\ncriminal case. On April 26, the petitioner filed notices of appeal\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fin both the civil and criminal cases.3 Although these appeals were\n\nconsolidated for briefing and argument in this court, we need look\n\nno further than the cross-appeals in the coram nobis proceeding.\n\nSee supra note 1.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           The focal point of our analysis is the government's\n\nassertion that the district court lacked authority to issue a writ\n\nof error coram nobis.    There is, however, a logically antecedent\n\nissue: the petitioner's suggestion that we have no jurisdiction to\n\nreview the order granting coram nobis relief.        We start there.\n\n                    A.   Appellate Jurisdiction.\n\n           The judgment in the coram nobis proceeding, on its face,\n\nseems final and appealable.       It leaves nothing to be done but the\n\nexecution of the judgment itself.         Catlin v.

In this regard,\n\nhis most loudly bruited claim is that a grant of coram nobis\n\nconstitutes an unreviewable act of judicial discretion.\n\n           The petitioner's sole support for this proposition is\n\nfragmentary   language   from    an   obscure   Supreme   Court   opinion,\n\n\n      3\n      Citing concerns about treating the writ of error coram nobis\nas an independent civil action, the petitioner moved in the\ndistrict court for the coram nobis order to be entered in the\ncriminal case, rather than entered separately. Although expressing\nsome sympathy for the petitioner's position, the district court\nruled that, due to the government's earlier notice of appeal, it\nlacked jurisdiction to reenter the order.\n\n                                   -10-\n\fPickett's Heirs v.

Here, however, it is doubtful that\n\nPickett's Heirs has any precedential force beyond its specific\n\nfacts.

That very question lies at the heart of the instant\n\nmatter, as the government contends that, in the circumstances of\n\nthis case, AEDPA's gatekeeping provisions foreclose any resort to\n\ncoram nobis.    We therefore do not regard Pickett's Heirs as\n\ncontradicting the general proposition that coram nobis orders are\n\nappealable.\n\n\n     4\n      While the Court referred to the technically distinct writ of\nerror coram vobis, see Pickett's Heirs, 32 U.S. at 146, the\ndistinction between coram nobis and coram vobis is \"virtually\nmeaningless\" in the American courts, United States v.

Coram\n\nnobis, in its present incarnation, bears little resemblance to the\n\nwrit as it existed in the early nineteenth century.                     We briefly\n\ntrace its evolution.\n\n            The writ of error coram nobis originated in sixteenth-\n\ncentury England as an instrument used by trial courts to correct\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\ftheir own fact-based errors.

For the most part, its use was confined to\n\ncivil cases.   See, e.g., 7 LaFave et al., supra § 28.1(c), at 143;\n\nLester B. Orfield, The Writ of Error Coram Nobis in Civil Practice,\n\n20 Va. L. Rev. 423, 427 (1934).    But, in time the tectonic plates\n\nshifted and the utility of the writ expanded.     It eventually grew\n\nbeyond the correction of mistakes of fact and became flexible\n\nenough to reach fundamental legal errors.    See Morgan, 346 U.S. at\n\n507-08; Mayer, 235 U.S. at 68; see also 3 Wright, King & Klein,\n\nFederal Practice & Procedure § 592, at 687 (3d ed. 2004).\n\n          As the writ of error coram nobis morphed to encompass\n\nmore than exclusively \"factual\" mistakes, it also began to gain a\n\nfoothold in the criminal docket.   See Sawyer, 239 F.3d at 37.   This\n\ntransmogrification occurred in a leisurely fashion; the writ was\n\nnot readily deployed in state criminal cases until well after the\n\nSupreme Court decided Pickett's Heirs.      See Abraham L. Freedman,\n\nThe Writ of Error Coram Nobis, 3 Temp. L.Q. 365, 373 (1929)\n\n(placing in the late nineteenth century \"the first criminal case of\n\nconsequence in which the writ was successfully employed\").       The\n\nwrit's migration to criminal cases in the federal courts was even\n\nslower; as late as 1914, the Supreme Court pointedly left open the\n\nquestion of the writ's availability in criminal cases.    See Mayer,\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f235 U.S. at 69.      Not until 1954 was the legitimacy of the writ's\n\nuse in criminal cases confirmed by the Court.            See Morgan, 346 U.S.\n\nat 512.\n\n            We now have come full circle: in the modern federal\n\nsystem, use of the writ of error coram nobis is confined to\n\ncriminal cases.      See id. at 505 n.4; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(e)\n\n(abolishing    the    writ    in   civil      cases).     To    complete     this\n\ntransformation, in criminal cases the writ has been seen more and\n\nmore as a means to challenge law-based errors.

Nearly two hundred years of\n\ndoctrinal development have sapped it of any contemporary vitality.\n\n            The petitioner has a fallback position.             He asseverates\n\nthat even if the grant or denial of a writ of error coram nobis is\n\ndeemed reviewable, the government lacks statutory authority to\n\nappeal such an order.

To support that proposition, he cherry-picks\n\na snippet in which the Morgan Court characterized the writ of error\n\ncoram nobis as a \"step in the criminal case and not, like habeas\n\ncorpus where relief is sought in a separate case and record, the\n\nbeginning of a separate civil proceeding.\"       346 U.S. at 505 n.4.\n\nIn our view, Morgan's footnote 4 cannot bear the heavy weight that\n\nthe petitioner piles upon it.\n\n          As an initial matter, the import of the footnote is\n\ntenebrous; the very next line of the footnote asserts that coram\n\nnobis \"is of the same general character as [proceedings] under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255.\"       Id.

Rather, the Morgan Court was confronted\n\nwith, and resolved, a much narrower problem: whether the writ could\n\nbe deployed to correct errors in criminal cases notwithstanding the\n\npromulgation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) (which\n\nabolished coram nobis in \"suits of a civil nature\").               See Morgan,\n\n346 U.S. at 505 n.4.   Judge Friendly found no reason to think that,\n\nin affirmatively answering this narrow question, the Morgan Court\n\nintended to determine that coram nobis orders should be treated as\n\ncriminal for all purposes.

While the modern writ of error coram nobis is\n\nused in criminal cases, its character necessarily reflects the\n\nvestiges of its origins in civil litigation.      Accordingly, many\n\ncourts have treated coram nobis as civil for a variety of purposes,\n\nsuch as the availability of discovery, see, e.g., Balistrieri, 606\n\nF.2d at 221, and the temporal limits for filing notices of appeal,\n\nsee, e.g., Keogh, 391 F.2d at 140.    Given the lessons of history,\n\nwe are convinced that coram nobis proceedings are best seen as\n\nhybrids — quasi-civil and quasi-criminal.    See Craig, 907 F.2d at\n\n656; Mercado v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"225483\"><a href=\"/opinion/225483/mercado-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">486</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 487 (1st Cir. 1950).\n\nOn this view, the denomination of the nature of a given petition\n\ncalls for a functional analysis rather than for doctrinal rigidity.\n\n          We see no reason here to apply the more restrictive rules\n\ngoverning criminal appeals to the government's appeal in a coram\n\nnobis proceeding (even though that proceeding is ancillary to a\n\ncriminal case).   The traditional restrictions on the government's\n\nright to appeal stem primarily from double jeopardy concerns.   See\n\nKepner v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96129\"><a href=\"/opinion/96129/kepner-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 133 (1904).    Such concerns\n\nare far less weighty when dealing with collateral challenges to\n\ncriminal convictions.   See 15B Wright, Miller & Cooper, supra §\n\n3919.9, at 732 (\"There is less need to restrict government appeal\n\nopportunities in proceedings that come . . . after the formal\n\nprosecution.\"). Consequently, we hold that coram nobis proceedings\n\nare appealable as civil matters.      Thus the government, like any\n\n\n                               -17-\n\fother party, may appeal the grant or denial of the writ as a final\n\norder under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.      See 15B Wright, Miller & Cooper,\n\nsupra § 3919.9, at 740 (positing by analogy to habeas corpus that\n\nthe government \"should be allowed to appeal final disposition of\n\ncoram nobis proceedings\"); see also Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(C).\n\n          The petitioner has one last arrow in his jurisdictional\n\nquiver. He contends that even if we find appellate jurisdiction in\n\ntheory, the government's appeal here is time-barred.        Once again,\n\nthis   contention    derives   from     the   Morgan   Court's   cryptic\n\ncharacterization of coram nobis as a \"step in the criminal case.\"\n\n346 U.S. at 505 n.4.      On that premise, the petitioner concludes\n\nthat the government was subject to the 30-day filing deadline\n\napplicable to government appeals in criminal cases, Fed. R. App. P.\n\n4(b)(1)(B); that the 30-day period ran from February 20, 2007 (when\n\nthe district court announced its decision to grant the writ); and\n\nthat, therefore, the government's notice of appeal, filed in mid-\n\nApril, was late.\n\n          This plaint is as insubstantial as a house built upon the\n\nshifting sands.     The short answer to it is that the Federal Rules\n\nof Appellate Procedure explicitly provide that \"[a]n appeal from an\n\norder granting or denying an application for a writ of error coram\n\nnobis is an appeal in a civil case\" and, thus, is subject to a 60-\n\nday filing period.     Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(C); see also Fed. R.\n\nApp. P. 4(a)(1)(B). This language was added to the Appellate Rules\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fin 2002 to resolve a conflict in the courts of appeals regarding\n\nthe time limits that applied to appeals from coram nobis orders.\n\nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4 advisory committee notes.          The amended rule\n\ncontrols here.   Accordingly, the government's notice of appeal was\n\ntimely even if, as the petitioner contends, the appeal period ran\n\nfrom February 20, 2007.5\n\n                        B.    AEDPA Preclusion.\n\n           Having confirmed the existence of appellate jurisdiction,\n\nwe turn to the substance of the government's appeal.         Distilled to\n\nits essence, the argument here is that the petition was a wolf in\n\nsheep's clothing: an unapproved second or successive section 2255\n\npetition masquerading as a petition for a writ of error coram\n\nnobis.    Relatedly, the government insists that coram nobis is\n\nunavailable to a prisoner in federal custody.        If these arguments\n\nare   well-founded,   the    district   court   lacked   jurisdiction   to\n\nentertain the petition.\n\n           The petitioner's initial rejoinder is in the nature of a\n\npreemptive strike.    He says that because the government failed to\n\n\n      5\n      Although we need not probe the point, the appeal period does\nnot appear to have run from the February 20 order but, rather, from\nthe later entry of final judgment in the coram nobis proceeding.\nSee Fed.

On its face,\n\nthe petition is brought on behalf of a federal prisoner still in\n\ncustody and challenges his sentence as unauthorized under the\n\nstatutes of conviction.   This is a classic habeas corpus scenario,\n\nsquarely within the heartland carved out by Congress in section\n\n2255. See 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a) (offering a means of post-conviction\n\nrelief to \"[a] prisoner in custody under sentence of a [federal]\n\ncourt\" who claims \"that [his] sentence was in excess of the maximum\n\nauthorized by law\").   As such, the claim embodied in the petition\n\nis one cognizable in a section 2255 proceeding.      Therefore, the\n\n\n\n\n                               -24-\n\fdistrict court should have recharacterized the petition as a\n\nsection 2255 petition and proceeded accordingly.\n\n           The conclusion that the petition should have been treated\n\nas one arising under section 2255 sounds a death knell for the\n\nproceeding.     The petition was filed more than ten years after the\n\npetitioner's conviction had become final and more than five years\n\nafter an earlier section 2255 petition (itself deemed to be time-\n\nbarred).   No pre-clearance had been either sought or obtained in\n\nthis court.     Consequently, the petition was an unauthorized second\n\nor successive habeas petition and was foreclosed on that basis.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 2255(h); see also United States v.

See Pratt, 129 F.3d at 57.\n\nEither way, the case was at an end: dismissal would have ended it,\n\nand transferring the recharacterized petition to this court would\n\nhave been an exercise in futility.       After all, the petition was not\n\npremised on either newly discovered evidence or a new rule of\n\nconstitutional law.     See 28 U.S.C. § 2255(h).\n\n           The petitioner attempts to escape the vise-like grip of\n\nAEDPA's gatekeeping provisions by asserting that a writ of error\n\ncoram   nobis    comprises   an   alternative,    and   constitutionally\n\nnecessary, method for challenging an illegal sentence, at least\n\nwhen other means of collateral review have been exhausted.          But\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\fwhere, as here, a petitioner's claim falls within the heartland of\n\nsection 2255, this assertion lacks force. \"The writ of coram nobis\n\nmay not be used to circumvent the clear congressional directive\n\nembodied in the 'second or successive' provisions of § 2255.\"\n\nBarrett, 178 F.3d at 55.\n\n          If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — the writ\n\nof error coram nobis, in its modern form, is ordinarily available\n\nonly to a criminal defendant who is no longer in custody.

(quoting 28 U.S.C. §\n\n\n\n\n                               -26-\n\f2255(e)).     This case does not come within the narrow confines of\n\nthe savings clause.\n\n            As indicated above, section 2255 is both adequate and\n\neffective to address a claim of the type and kind mounted by the\n\npetitioner.    Although the petitioner might now be unable to pursue\n\nthat claim via a second or successive petition because of the\n\ncombination     of   his    own   tardiness   and   AEDPA's   gatekeeping\n\nprovisions, the mere inability to satisfy those requirements does\n\nnot afford access to the savings clause.        See id. at 50.     To rule\n\notherwise   would    reduce   AEDPA's   gatekeeping   provisions    to   \"a\n\nmeaningless gesture.\"       Id.; accord In re Davenport, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755435\"><a href=\"/opinion/755435/in-re-james-davenport-and-sherman-nichols/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n608 (7th Cir. 1998).\n\n            The bottom line is that adequacy and effectiveness must\n\nbe judged ex ante.         Accordingly, post-conviction relief can be\n\ntermed \"inadequate\" or \"ineffective\" only when, in a particular\n\ncase, the configuration of section 2255 is such \"as to deny a\n\nconvicted defendant any opportunity for judicial rectification.\"\n\nIn re Davenport, 147 F.3d at 611 (emphasis in original).\n\n            The record here makes manifest that the petitioner cannot\n\nsatisfy that demanding standard.        He had multiple opportunities to\n\nchallenge the imposition of his life sentences as inconsistent with\n\nthe terms of the statutes of conviction.            His alleged claim of\n\n\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\ferror was available to him on both direct and collateral review;7\n\nand those review modalities, if timely engaged, would have offered\n\nan adequate and effective means of rectifying the error.              That he\n\nneglected    to   avail   himself   of   these   opportunities   in   no   way\n\ndetracts from their adequacy and effectiveness.\n\n            The fact that courts have allowed recourse to the savings\n\nclause in rare and exceptional circumstances, such as those in\n\nwhich strict adherence to AEDPA's gatekeeping provisions would\n\nresult in a \"complete miscarriage of justice,\" In re Dorsainvil,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744070\"><a href=\"/opinion/744070/in-re-ocsulis-dorsainvil/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 251 (3d Cir. 1997), does not help the petitioner.\n\nMost courts have required a credible allegation of actual innocence\n\nto access the savings clause.        See, e.g., Reyes-Requena v.

The petitioner's claim\n\ndoes not qualify; his petition does not posit that he is actually\n\ninnocent of the crimes for which he was indicted, convicted, and\n\nsentenced.\n\n            Equally as important, the nature of the petitioner's\n\nclaim of error is incompatible with engagement of the savings\n\nclause.     He does not charge that a life sentence is beyond the\n\nstatutory maximum for the crimes of conviction.          Rather, his claim\n\n\n\n     7\n      By the time the petitioner was indicted, the interpretation\nof the penalty provision on which he now relies had already been\nadopted by at least two federal courts of appeals in published\nopinions.

This\n\nclaim, if true, does not suggest a miscarriage of justice.        We\n\nexplain briefly.\n\n            The Supreme Court has defined the term \"miscarriage of\n\njustice\" as encompassing only those \"extraordinary instances when\n\na constitutional violation probably has caused the conviction of\n\none innocent of the crime.\"    McCleskey v. Zant, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112573\"><a href=\"/opinion/112573/mccleskey-v-zant/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 494\n\n(1991).   The petitioner makes no such claim; he does not challenge\n\nthe sufficiency of the evidence upon which the sentencing judge\n\nacted, nor does he suggest that it was likely that a jury would\n\nhave reached a different result.\n\n            Rules that allocate decisionmaking responsibility between\n\njudge and jury are generally thought to be procedural. See Schriro\n\nv. Summerlin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136996\"><a href=\"/opinion/136996/schriro-v-summerlin/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 353 (2004).    As such, misallocation of\n\nthat responsibility is unlikely to implicate the accuracy or\n\nfundamental fairness of judicial proceedings. See, e.g., Sepulveda\n\nv. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200481\"><a href=\"/opinion/200481/sepulveda-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 61 (1st Cir. 2003) (holding, in the\n\nApprendi context, that decisions made by the judge instead of the\n\njury are \"not the sort of error that necessarily undermines the\n\nfairness . . . of judicial proceedings\") (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    Here, the petitioner has given us no reason to suspect\n\nthat the misallocation affected his substantial rights.\n\n\n                                 -29-\n\f           The final shot in the petitioner's sling is that the\n\nright to correct an illegal sentence is a basic right for which the\n\nConstitution guarantees a remedy.                      This platitude has little\n\nutility here.\n\n           It     is    well-established              that     a    criminal    defendant\n\npossesses no general constitutional right to appellate review.\n\nSee, e.g., McKane v. Durston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93926\"><a href=\"/opinion/93926/mckane-v-durston/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687 (1894); United\n\nStates v.

By the\n\nsame token, errors committed at trial, even those of constitutional\n\ndimension,   do    not       invariably           require    reversal.         See,   e.g.,\n\nWashington v.

If he\n\nfailed to raise a particular claim of error at the appropriate\n\ntime, enforcement of the usual rules of waiver and preclusion\n\nscarcely can be deemed a violation of his constitutional right to\n\nan appeal. Thus we conclude, without serious question, that to the\n\nextent that the Constitution affords a defendant a right to correct\n\nerrors in judicial proceedings through either appellate review or\n\ncollateral attack, that right has not been sullied here.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -30-\n\fIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n            We appreciate the able district judge's desire to correct\n\nan     apparent     error    attributable      to    the    lawyers'     shared\n\nmisperception.        We admire as well the ingenuity displayed by\n\nappointed counsel in attempting to rectify that mistake.                But the\n\nrule of law must remain paramount and, as Lord Campbell warned long\n\nago, hard cases have a propensity to make bad law.                See Burnham v.\n\nGuardian Life Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522153\"><a href=\"/opinion/522153/joan-c-burnham-etc-v-the-guardian-life-insurance-company-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">486</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 487 (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting\n\nUnited    States    v.

That is\n\nour obligation here.\n\n            Implicit in the scheme created by AEDPA is the notion\n\nthat certain claims, which might have been fruitful if timely\n\nasserted, may be foreclosed when a convicted defendant sleeps upon\n\nhis rights.       See Dodd v.

That\n\nour criminal justice system tolerates a certain risk of error might\n\nbe of concern to some, but finality is indispensable to the proper\n\nfunctioning of that system. Under AEDPA, there is typically \"only\n\none bite at the post-conviction apple.\"             Barrett, 178 F.3d at 57.\n\nThe petitioner has had that bite.\n\n            We need go no further.
