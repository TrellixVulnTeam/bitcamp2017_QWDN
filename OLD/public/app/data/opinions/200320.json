Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Luis Sanchez Betances, with whom Gerardo De Jesus Annoni and\nSanchez-Betances & Sifre, P.S.C. were on brief, for appellants.\n     Paul T. Friedman, with whom Ruth N. Borenstein, Morrison &\nFoerster, LLP, Pedro J. Manzano and Fiddler Gonzalez & Rodriguez,\nLLP, were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                          February 4, 2003\n\f              HOWARD, Circuit Judge.          The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n\nhas enacted a statutory regime that prohibits an interstate air\n\ncarrier from delivering any package unless the carrier first\n\nprovides       proof    that   the    package's    addressee         has   paid     the\n\nappropriate excise tax, or the carrier prepays the amount of the\n\ntax on the addressee's behalf.              Plaintiffs United Parcel Service,\n\nInc.,    and    United     Parcel     Service,    Co.,    (collectively        \"UPS\")\n\npersuaded the district court to enjoin the Commonwealth's Treasury\n\nSecretary from enforcing these delivery restrictions on the grounds\n\nof federal preemption.         The parties have filed cross-appeals which\n\nraise difficult questions about the lawfulness and proper scope of\n\nthe injunction in light of arguably conflicting federal statutes\n\nthat, on the one hand, strip the district court of jurisdiction to\n\nentertain suits seeking to restrain the collection of any Puerto\n\nRico    tax    and     authorize     the   Commonwealth        to   exercise   taxing\n\njurisdiction over packages as soon as they enter the island, and,\n\non the other hand, limit the Commonwealth's ability to regulate an\n\nair carrier's service.           In the end, we affirm the court's central\n\nruling   but     remand    for     reconsideration       of    several     peripheral\n\nmatters.\n\n               Before us, Defendant Juan A. Flores-Galarza, in his\n\nofficial capacity         as   the    Secretary   of     the    Department     of   the\n\nTreasury of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the \"Secretary\"),\n\ncontends that the district court erred in finding that it had\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fjurisdiction over the controversy, that Puerto Rico's restrictions\n\non   delivery      were    preempted    by     federal   law,     and   that   an\n\nadministrative fine imposed by the Secretary was invalid and\n\nunenforceable.         The Secretary also makes an alternative argument\n\nthat the injunction is overbroad.              UPS's cross-appeal challenges\n\nthe district court's exclusion from the scope of the injunction a\n\nstatutory provision requiring the payment of license fees by air\n\ncarriers.\n\n                  I.    Factual and Procedural Background\n\n            The    plaintiffs   are    corporate      affiliates   with   common\n\ncontrolling       ownership   engaged     in    the    delivery    of   packages\n\nworldwide.    United Parcel Service Co. is authorized by the Federal\n\nAviation Administration to operate as an air carrier for the\n\ntransportation of property, and United Parcel Service, Inc. is\n\nengaged in the transportation of property by motor vehicle.                    UPS\n\noffers door-to-door delivery service and the delivery of packages\n\non an express or time-guaranteed basis.            In certain circumstances,\n\nUPS refunds delivery charges for express packages that have not\n\nbeen timely delivered. UPS ships approximately 10,000 packages per\n\nday to Puerto Rico from the continental United States.                     UPS's\n\ndelivery operations function as an integrated system, requiring\n\nextensive planning and coordination among its operating facilities,\n\nground fleet, and air fleet.          Delays and disruptions in operations\n\ncan affect thousands of packages in transit.\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f           Puerto Rico imposes an excise tax1 on \"articles of use\n\nand consumption,\" including those introduced from elsewhere.               13\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. § 9005.       The general tax rate is 5 percent of the\n\ntaxable price, although the rate varies depending on the article,\n\nand there are numerous exemptions.           See, e.g., 13 P.R. Laws Ann.\n\n§ 9015, 9031. No interstate carrier transporting a package subject\n\nto an excise levied by the Commonwealth may deliver the package to\n\nits intended recipient unless the recipient (the \"consignee\")\n\npresents   a   certificate    from    the    Department    of   the   Treasury\n\nevidencing payment of the requisite tax.           13 P.R. Laws Ann. § 9066\n\n(\"§ 9066\"). If a carrier delivers a package without obtaining this\n\ncertificate, the carrier may be required to pay an administrative\n\nfine to the Secretary, a tax on the package's contents, and any\n\nsurcharges and interest accrued from the date the items were\n\nintroduced into Puerto Rico.         See id.; see also 13 P.R. Laws Ann.\n\n§§ 8080(a), 8140(6).\n\n           As an alternative to the certificate system established\n\nby § 9066, carriers such as UPS may prepay the taxes owed, deliver\n\nthe packages, and seek reimbursement from the packages' consignees.\n\n13 P.R. Laws Ann. § 9077; Article 6.005 of Regulations for the\n\nAdministration    and   Enforcement         of   the   Excise   Tax   of   the\n\n\n\n     1\n      An excise tax is \"[a] tax imposed on the manufacture, sale,\nor use of goods (such as a cigarette tax), or an occupation or\nactivity (such as a license tax or an attorney occupation fee).\"\nBlack's Law Dictionary 585 (7th ed. 1999).\n\n                                     -4-\n\fCommonwealth of Puerto Rico (the \"Articles\"). To take advantage of\n\nthis alternative, carriers must comply with a complex statutory and\n\nregulatory scheme resembling the federal customs system.                Carriers\n\nmust provide the Department of the Treasury, on a daily basis, a\n\ncommercial invoice for each package that describes the package's\n\ncontents and their cost, as well as a \"shipment manifest\" that\n\nlists packages by specific categories.                See 1994 Procedure for\n\nFreight Air    and   Ocean   Forwarders       Who   Are   Authorized     for   the\n\nSecretary of the Treasury to Pay Taxes and Take Credit for Articles\n\nReturned or Paid In Excess or Improperly (\"1994 Procedure\") ¶¶ 1-4,\n\n8, 11.\n\n            Additionally,     carriers       who    prepay   taxes    must     make\n\npackages available for inspection by Treasury agents, and give the\n\nagents access to their facilities to supervise the processing of\n\npackages.     See    1994   Procedure    ¶    10.     Carriers   must    create,\n\nmaintain, and make available for inspection extensive records\n\nrelating to the prepayment of fees.          See 13 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 8102,\n\n8140(1); Articles 5.005(7),(11), 6.005.             Puerto Rico also requires\n\nprepaying carriers to post a bond in excess of the amount required\n\nof all carriers under general licensing provisions.2                 13 P.R. Laws\n\n\n     2\n      All carriers, even if they do not participate in the\nprepayment mechanism, must obtain a license from the Secretary to\nconduct business in the Commonwealth.     See 13 P.R. Laws Ann. §\n9060. The Secretary retains the discretion to deny, suspend, or\nrevoke such licenses. See 13 P.R. Laws Ann. § 9061; Article 5.005.\nTo obtain a license, carriers must pay a license fee, submit a copy\nof the income tax return and criminal record of each corporate\n\n                                    -5-\n\fAnn. § 9077.    Finally, carriers must calculate and pay the taxes\n\nowed by the consignees.    13 P.R. Laws Ann. § 9077; Article 6.005.\n\n            Unlike commercial carriers, the United States Postal\n\nService may deliver packages to destinations in Puerto Rico without\n\nobtaining   certificates   from   recipients   or   complying   with   the\n\nprepayment scheme.    Recipients of packages subject to the excise\n\ntax must pay the tax directly to the Department of the Treasury\n\nwithin two business days of receiving a package through the U.S.\n\nmail.    13 P.R. Laws Ann. § 9068(b)(2).\n\n            As described in greater detail in the opinion of the\n\ndistrict court, United Parcel Service Inc., v. Flores-Galarza, 210\n\nF. Supp. 2d 33, 38-40 (D.P.R. 2002), UPS has been required to alter\n\nsignificantly the business practices it employs for the rest of the\n\nUnited States to comply with the Commonwealth's prepayment scheme.3\n\nUPS must, among other things, collect and process comprehensive\n\ndata on the contents of packages,4 perform tax ratings on these\n\n\nofficer, and post a bond.      See 13 P.R. Laws         Ann.    §§   9059,\n9060(a)(1)-(6), 9064; Articles 5.004, 5.008.\n     3\n      If UPS chose not to comply with the Commonwealth's prepayment\nscheme, delivery would be delayed until a consignee obtained\ninformation about the contents of a package, determined the\napplicable tax, paid the tax to the Secretary, obtained a\ncertificate authorizing delivery, and notified UPS that these steps\nhad been completed.\n     4\n      UPS does not require persons shipping to other parts of the\nUnited States to identify the contents of a package or their value.\nFor packages being shipped to Puerto Rico, however, shippers must\ncomplete two commercial invoices with this information so that UPS\ncan determine the amount of tax owed.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fcontents, and delay the delivery of packages until all necessary\n\ndata have been obtained, or until Treasury agents have had an\n\nopportunity to inspect the packages on site.            UPS also bears the\n\nburden of seeking reimbursement from consignees, pays additional\n\namounts if agents alter assessments on packages after they have\n\nbeen delivered, and maintains a $1.5 million bond. UPS incurs more\n\nthan $4.6 million per year in costs associated with its compliance\n\nwith the prepayment scheme.\n\n          In   1994,    Congress     passed       the   Federal     Aviation\n\nAdministration Authorization Act (the \"FAA Authorization Act\"),\n\nwhich provided, in relevant part, that no state (defined to include\n\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) may \"enact or enforce a law,\n\nregulation, or other provision having the force and effect of a law\n\nrelated to a price, route, or service of an air carrier . . . when\n\nsuch carrier is transporting property by aircraft or by motor\n\nvehicle.\" 49 U.S.C. § 41713(b)(4)(A). This legislation recodified\n\na preemption provision of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978,\n\nPub. L. No. 95-504, § 105, 92 Stat. 1708.\n\n          In   late   1997,   the   Senate   of    Puerto   Rico   passed   a\n\nresolution directing various Senate committees to investigate the\n\nFAA Authorization Act's impact on existing statutes and regulations\n\nof Puerto Rico affecting carriers' prices, routes and services.\n\nIt did so after reaching the preliminary conclusion that the\n\nexisting scheme might be in conflict with federal law.            See S. Res.\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f917, 13th Leg. Assem., 2d Ord. Sess. (P.R. 1997).       Two years later,\n\nthe Puerto Rico legislature confirmed this conclusion, finding that\n\nnumerous laws and regulations, including those of the local excise\n\ntax system, were impacting or affecting the prices, routes and\n\nservices of air carriers and affiliated motor carriers.           See Act\n\nNo. 322, 13th Leg. Assem., 6th Ord. Sess. (P.R. 1999) (\"Act 322\").\n\nIn November 1999, the legislature passed Act 322, which would allow\n\nair     carriers   to   transport    packages   to   consignees   without\n\nrestriction, and require consignees to pay the excise tax within\n\ntwo business days.      Id.   Under Act 322, air carriers would provide\n\nthe Secretary with \"the minimum information agreed as necessary in\n\norder for the Secretary to proceed to collect the excise taxes,\n\nwithout unreasonably interfering in the ordinary course of business\n\nin interstate commerce.\"       Id.   This new legislation also exempted\n\nair carriers from licensing requirements.        Id.\n\n            The provisions of Act 322 removing impediments to the\n\ndelivery of packages would not become effective until June 30,\n\n2001.    The legislature concluded that the intervening period would\n\nbe sufficient for the Department of the Treasury to develop and\n\nimplement an alternative system consistent with federal law.          See\n\nid.     In the interim, Act 322 provided immediate relief for air\n\ncarriers by authorizing them to withhold five percent of the taxes\n\nthey prepaid to the Secretary to defray the costs associated with\n\nthe existing system.      See id.\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f            Act 322's provisions allowing unrestricted delivery were\n\neffective   for   only   two   business   days    before   the   statute   was\n\nrepealed. In July 2001, the Puerto Rico legislature reinstated the\n\n§ 9066 conditional ban on delivery, as well as the prepayment\n\nalternative.      During the two business days that Act 322 was\n\neffective, UPS delivered packages without collecting excise taxes.\n\nUPS provided the Secretary with commercial invoices for each\n\npackage delivered during those days, which included some, but not\n\nall, of the information previously required to be included in daily\n\n\"shipment manifests.\"\n\n            On the same day that Act 322 was repealed, July 3, 2001,\n\nUPS brought suit in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico to enjoin the enforcement of those statutes\n\nand regulations     affecting    its   delivery    of   packages.     In   its\n\ncomplaint, UPS alleged that Puerto Rico’s restrictions on delivery\n\nwere preempted by the FAA Authorization Act and therefore violated\n\nthe Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl.2.5          UPS also alleged\n\nthat the scheme violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I,\n\n§ 8, cl.3; Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, cl. 1.;\n\nand Takings Clause, U.S. Const. amend. V.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      In particular, UPS sought to enjoin 13 P.R. Law Ann. §§ 8102,\n8140, 9060, 9061, 9064, 9066, 9068, 9077; and the 1994 Procedure.\nIt also requested relief from any other statute, regulation or\nprovision having the force and effect of law that fell within the\nscope of the FAA Authorization Act's preemption provision.\n\n                                    -9-\n\f             In the weeks immediately following the filing of the\n\ncomplaint,    the    Secretary   directed   UPS    to   turn    over    shipping\n\nmanifests for the two-day period in July 2001 when Act 322 was in\n\neffect.     UPS agreed to do so, but only on the condition that the\n\ninformation would not be used in connection with the pending\n\nlitigation.     The Secretary rejected this offer.             On November 26,\n\n2001, the Secretary issued an administrative fine against UPS of\n\n$14.24 million, citing UPS's failure to provide certain information\n\nallegedly \"agreed upon\" at a meeting of the parties on June 29,\n\n2001.     This amount represented a $1000 fine for each package\n\ndelivered, based on the Secretary’s estimate that approximately\n\n7120 packages were processed each day.            UPS made a timely request\n\nfor reconsideration and an administrative hearing, reserving its\n\nright to contest the validity of the fine.\n\n             In addition to pursuing its administrative remedies, UPS\n\nrequested that the district court grant a temporary restraining\n\norder or preliminary injunction to prevent the Secretary from\n\nenforcing the challenged scheme or the administrative fine.                    In\n\nDecember 2001, the district court denied this request, concluding\n\nthat UPS failed to demonstrate that it would suffer irreparable\n\nharm if forced to seek relief at the administrative level or that\n\nbypassing    the    administrative   process   was      justified      under   the\n\ncircumstances.      In reaching its decision, the district court found\n\nthat the fine arose from a dispute over the information that the\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fparties \"purportedly agreed\" would be provided to the Secretary.\n\nUPS appealed the district court's decision to this Court.6\n\n           By March 2002, the Secretary had not responded to a\n\nmotion for summary judgment filed by UPS in August 2001, prior to\n\nthe emergence of the administrative fine controversy. The district\n\ncourt ordered the Secretary to file an opposition by March 21,\n\n2002.7   The Secretary opposed UPS’s motion for summary judgment on\n\nApril 8, 2002, but failed to submit any statement of contested\n\nmaterial facts as required by Local Rule 311.12.\n\n           In May 2002, the district court issued a series of\n\nopinions and orders that, collectively, granted summary judgment in\n\nfavor of UPS and held that the FAA Authorization Act preempted\n\nPuerto   Rico’s   statutory   and   regulatory   scheme   affecting   the\n\ndelivery of packages.   The district court permanently enjoined the\n\nenforcement of all statutory and regulatory provisions challenged\n\nby UPS except 13 P.R. Laws Ann. § 9059, a licensing requirement\n\n\n     6\n      United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Flores-Galarza, No. 01-2767.\nUPS also asked this Court for injunctive relief pending appeal, or,\nalternatively, an expedited appeal. We denied these requests, but\ndid so without prejudice to UPS's renewal of its request for\ninjunctive relief pending interlocutory appeal if the district\ncourt denied a pending motion seeking the same relief.\n     7\n      The Secretary then moved to stay the proceedings pending\nUPS's interlocutory appeal, or, alternatively, to enlarge the\nperiod for discovery and for responding to the motion for summary\njudgment.    The district court denied this motion, citing the\nSecretary’s failure to comply with Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure, and noting the ample six-month period following\nthe filing of the motion for summary judgment that the Secretary\ncould have utilized to conduct discovery.\n\n                                    -11-\n\freferenced in UPS's summary judgment papers but not expressly\n\nincluded within UPS's request for relief.   The district court also\n\ninvalidated the $14.24 million administrative fine imposed by the\n\nSecretary on the ground that it was imposed pursuant to the\n\npreempted scheme.   The district court based its decision on the\n\npapers filed by the parties, and did not convene a hearing before\n\nimposing the injunction.8\n\n           The Secretary appealed, and UPS cross-appealed solely to\n\nthe extent the district court excluded the licensing provision, §\n\n9059, from the scope of the permanent injunction.         UPS also\n\nobtained a voluntary dismissal of its appeal to this Court on the\n\nissue of enforcement of the administrative fine.       See note 6,\n\nabove.   In July 2002, at the request of the Secretary, this Court\n\ngranted a stay of the permanent injunction pending resolution of\n\nthe appeal.9\n\n     8\n      The district court had previously scheduled for October 1,\n2001 an evidentiary hearing consolidating UPS's requests for\npreliminary and permanent injunctive relief.     Citing a need to\nfirst address a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction filed by the Secretary, the court cancelled the\nhearing, but did not reschedule it before reaching a final decision\nin this case.\n     9\n      The injunction was stayed by a 2-to-1 decision of a panel of\nthis Court. The majority noted that it could not be certain that\nthe appellant had shown a clear probability of success, but that\n\"the issues are complicated and in our view the equities and the\npublic interest justify maintaining the status quo ante for the\nadditional period necessary to entertain the appeal.\"        Judge\nTorruella voted against staying the permanent injunction, noting\nthat the Secretary had not demonstrated a probability of success,\nand that UPS, unlike the Secretary, would suffer irreparable harm\nif the stay was imposed.\n\n                               -12-\n\f                                II.   Analysis\n\n          We     replay   a    familiar    refrain.      Summary   judgment     is\n\nappropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and\n\nthe moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\nRochester Ford Sales, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 287 F.3d 32, 38 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).      We review de novo the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment.     See id.    In so doing, we construe the record in\n\nthe light most favorable to the nonmovant, resolving all reasonable\n\ninferences in that party's favor.            See id.       Here, however, the\n\ndistrict court, acting within its discretion to manage its cases,\n\naccepted the uncontested facts submitted by UPS because of the\n\nSecretary's     failure   to   comply     with   Local    Rule   311.12    in   its\n\nopposition.10    See A.M. Capen's Co., Inc. v. American Trading and\n\nProd, Corp., 202 F.3d 469, (1st Cir. 2000).

Conservation\n\nLaw Found., Inc. v. Busey, 79 F.3d 1250, 1256 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nA.        Federal Jurisdiction\n\n          As a threshold issue, the Secretary contends that a\n\nprovision of the Butler Act, codified at 48 U.S.C. § 872,11 deprived\n\nthe district court of jurisdiction over the action filed by UPS.\n\nUnder the Butler Act, \"[n]o suit for the purpose of restraining the\n\nassessment or collection of a tax imposed by the laws of Puerto\n\nRico shall be maintained in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico.\"        48 U.S.C. § 872.         For the reasons\n\nthat follow, the prohibition does not apply to this case.\n\n             The   Secretary   contends    that   UPS   has   challenged   the\n\nstatutory and regulatory mechanism for collecting the excise tax,\n\nthus UPS seeks to restrain the assessment or collection of the tax\n\n\n     11\n       This provision of the Butler Act is analogous to the Tax\nInjunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341, which limits the jurisdiction of\nfederal district courts to entertain suits to enjoin the levying or\ncollection of a state tax.      The two statutes employ different\nlanguage (i.e. the Tax Injunction Act includes an express exception\nthat the Butler Act lacks), but \"have been construed in pari\nmateria.\" Trailer Marine Transp. Corp. v. Rivera-Vazquez, 977 F.2d\n1, 5 (1st Cir. 1992) (citing Parker v. Agosto-Alicea, 878 F.2d 557,\n558-59 (1st Cir. 1989)).\n\n                                    -14-\n\fwithin the meaning of the Butler Act.                But the action initiated by\n\nUPS   sought   to    enjoin     only   those    provisions      of   the   laws   and\n\nregulations of Puerto Rico that prohibit or interfere with the\n\ndelivery of packages. UPS did not challenge the amount or validity\n\nof the excise tax, nor the authority of the Secretary to assess or\n\ncollect it.    The relief sought by UPS leaves the Secretary free to\n\ncollect the tax from those who owe it.\n\n           Not every statutory or regulatory obligation that may aid\n\nthe Secretary's ability to collect a tax is immune from attack in\n\nfederal court by virtue of the Butler Act's jurisdictional bar.\n\nSee Wells v. Malloy, 510 F.2d 74, 76-77 (2d Cir. 1975)(Friendly,\n\nJ.)(action questioning the constitutionality of a statute providing\n\nfor suspension of a driver's license for failure to pay motor\n\nvehicle taxes       did   not   constitute      an    attempt   to   restrain     the\n\nassessment or levy of the tax); see also Mobil Oil Corp. v. Tully,\n\n639 F.2d 912, 918 (2d Cir. 1981)(holding that the \"mere fact that\n\nthe [challenged provision] is contained in a tax law of the State\n\nshould not lead to automatic sanctuary\" under the Tax Injunction\n\nAct).     Such      an    interpretation       extends    the    concept    of    tax\n\ncollection, and therefore the breadth of the Butler Act, too far.\n\nSee Wells, 510 F.2d at 77 (rejecting as overbroad an interpretation\n\nof tax collection that would include \"anything that a state has\n\ndetermined to be a likely method of securing payment\").\n\n\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\f               Like   the    Tax      Injunction    Act,    the   Butler   Act's\n\njurisdictional bar extends to\n\n     cases where taxpayers were repeatedly using the federal\n     courts to raise questions of state or federal law going\n     to the validity of the particular taxes imposed upon them\n     -- not to a case where a taxpayer contended that an\n     unusual sanction for non-payment of a tax admittedly due\n     violated his constitutional rights, an issue which, once\n     determined, would be determined for him and all others.\n\nId. (notation omitted). Admittedly, the conditional ban on package\n\ndeliveries may not seem to be in some respects as unusual as the\n\ndrivers' license penalty in Wells.                  Nevertheless, because the\n\ndelivery ban targets third parties instead of those who owe the\n\ntax, this is not a prototypical Tax Injunction Act or Butler Act\n\ncase.     UPS does not seek to restrain a system that \"produce[s]\n\nmoney or other property directly.\"                 Id.     Instead, by exposing\n\ncommercial carriers to fines and penalties (including the loss of\n\ntheir license to do business in Puerto Rico) if they choose to\n\ndeliver    a    package     without    collecting    a   certificate   from   the\n\nrecipient, § 9066 produces tax money \"indirectly through a more\n\ngeneral use of coercive power,\" id., using the threat of sanctions\n\nagainst private parties who do not even owe the taxes at issue.12\n\n     12\n      In this respect, the case before us is distinguishable from\ncases cited by the Secretary challenging payroll withholding as a\nmechanism of tax collection. See United States v. American Friends\nSociety Comm., 419 U.S. 7 (1974); Sipe v. Amerada Hess Corp., 689\nF.2d 396 (3d Cir. 1982). These challenges, which fell outside the\njurisdiction of the district courts under the Anti-Injunction Act,\n26 U.S.C. § 7421(a) and the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341,\nrespectively, attacked a method of tax collection. Section 9066 is\na conditional ban on package deliveries, not a method of tax\ncollection.\n\n                                         -16-\n\fThis is not a system of tax collection within the meaning of the\n\nButler Act.\n\n            The fact that commercial carriers have the option -- a\n\nperhaps   generous   characterization   --   to   participate   in   the\n\nalternative prepayment system does not alter the equation.           The\n\nprepayment alternative would have no teeth independent of the §\n\n9066 ban on service.      It may thus be the case that, for all\n\npractical purposes, commercial carriers have been conscripted into\n\nmaking payments on behalf of taxpayers, thereby promoting the\n\nSecretary's revenue raising efficiency as a condition of doing\n\nbusiness.     But we should not deny a federal forum to a party\n\nchallenging the constitutionality of this system on the ground that\n\nan adverse ruling could make the Secretary's job harder.13\n\nB.          Preemption under the FAA Authorization Act\n\n            Urging that Puerto Rico's restrictions on delivery are\n\nnot preempted by the FAA Authorization Act, the Secretary advances\n\ntwo principal arguments.    First, the Secretary notes that Puerto\n\nRico has a special taxing power under Section 3 of the Federal\n\nRelations Act, 48 U.S.C. § 741a.    According to the Secretary, the\n\n\n\n     13\n      Our decision in United States Brewers Association, Inc. v.\nPerez, 592 F.2d 1212 (1st Cir. 1979) is not to the contrary.\nThere, the plaintiffs challenged the Commonwealth's tax on beer\nproduced by large manufacturers, seeking either to restrain the\nimposition of the tax, or to require the Commonwealth to impose the\ntax on all manufacturers. See id. at 1215. That case, unlike the\ncase now before us, directly attacked the Commonwealth's taxing\nauthority. See id.\n\n                                -17-\n\fFAA Authorization Act cannot be read to limit this unique taxing\n\nauthority   by   preempting        statutes     and   regulations    that   merely\n\nimplement it. Second, the Secretary contends that Congress did not\n\nintend to preempt the challenged statutes and regulations, which\n\neither fall outside the scope of the FAA Authorization Act's\n\npreemptive effect or are preserved under other provisions of\n\nfederal law.       Although ably pressed, both of these arguments\n\nultimately come up short.\n\n            1. The Role of the Federal Relations Act\n\n            Section 3 of the Federal Relations Act provides in part\n\nthat any excise tax imposed by Puerto Rico \"may be levied and\n\ncollected . . . as soon as the [taxable items] are manufactured,\n\nsold, used, or brought into the island.\"               48 U.S.C. § 741a.       The\n\nSecretary   says    that    the     parcel      delivery    requirements    merely\n\nimplement    Puerto      Rico's    taxing       authority   under   the     Federal\n\nRelations Act.     So, he argues, \"this case does not involve a state\n\nstatute that is subject to preemption by a federal statute,\" but\n\ninstead involves only the interface between two federal statutes,\n\nthe FAA Authorization Act and the Federal Relations Act.                   The case\n\nwould thus turn on whether the FAA Authorization Act impliedly\n\nrepealed the Federal Relations Act. The Secretary says it did not.\n\n            Pointing to Congress's 1927 addition of the language that\n\nthe excise tax may be levied \"as soon as\" taxable goods are brought\n\ninto   Puerto    Rico,    and     that   U.S.    Customs    and   Postal    Service\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\fofficials \"are directed to assist the appropriate officials of the\n\nPuerto Rican government in the collection of these taxes,\"14 48\n\nU.S.C. § 741a, the Secretary contends that Puerto Rico has specific\n\nCongressional authorization to restrict the delivery of packages as\n\nnecessary to collect the excise tax.\n\n           Taken alone, Section 3 would seem to strengthen the\n\nSecretary's hand in challenges to the tax and perhaps even its \"no\n\ndelivery\" feature, at least as to those challenges based on the\n\nCommerce Clause.      In practice, Puerto Rico has wielded a unique\n\npower as a result of the Federal Relations Act.               In the years\n\nfollowing the 1927 amendment, Puerto Rico succeeded in imposing a\n\nstate tax on oil imported into bonded warehouses where New York\n\nfailed -- the critical distinction between the two taxes being the\n\nspecific   taxing    authority   of   Puerto   Rico   under   the   Federal\n\nRelations Act.      Compare West India Oil Co. v. Domenech, 311 U.S.\n\n20, 25-27 (1940)(permitting Puerto Rico to impose tax on fuel oil\n\nimported into bonded warehouses because of Puerto Rico's taxing\n\nauthority under 48 U.S.C. § 741a), with McGoldrick v. Gulf Oil\n\nCorp., 309 U.S. 414, (1940) (invalidating a New York sales tax\n\nimposed on crude oil imported into warehouses under bond because of\n\nits conflict with federal statutes occupying the field).            The West\n\nIndia Court allowed Puerto Rico to impose the tax, despite federal\n\n     14\n      Section 3 of the Federal Relations Act was amended by the\nButler Act of 1927, ch. 503, 44 Stat. 1418, the same legislation\nthat imposed the federal jurisdictional limitation on tax suits\ndiscussed in Section II.A., above.\n\n                                  -19-\n\fstatutes enacted after the Federal Relations Act and its 1927\n\namendment     indicating   Congress's     intent    to   regulate    bonded\n\nwarehouses.     See West India, 311 U.S. at 29 (\"[C]onsidering the\n\nrelationship of general Congressional legislation to legislation\n\nspecifically    applicable   to   our   territories,     and   possessions,\n\nrepeals by implication are not to be favored and will not be\n\nadjudged unless the legislative intention to repeal is clear.\").\n\n            Despite Section 3 of the Federal Relations Act’s reach,\n\nthere does not appear to be any evidence that Congress focused at\n\nall on the delivery bar issue, much less intended a specific\n\nendorsement of a scheme in which carriers were to be barred from\n\nmaking deliveries until they produced certificates that as a\n\npractical matter could not be done on a widespread basis. Congress\n\nintended that the 1927 amendment to the Federal Relations Act\n\nresolve existing controversy over whether taxes could be imposed on\n\ngoods still in their original packaging.15         See H.R. Rep. No. 1370,\n\nat 2 (1926); S. Rep. No. 1011, at 2 (1926) Previously, courts had\n\nheld that U.S. Customs and Postal Service officials could not\n\nwithhold delivery of incoming articles, \"as such tax collected in\n\n\n     15\n      At the time of the amendment, the \"original package\"\ndistinction was significant: Existing Supreme Court precedent held\nthat state taxes on goods that were \"imports\" and not yet\n\"incorporated into the mass of property in the State\" (such as\ngoods in their original packages) were invalid under the Import-\nExport Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 10, cl. 2. See Low v. Austin,\n80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 29 (1871); see also United States v.\nInternational Bus. Mach. Corp., 517 U.S. 843 (1996)(chronicling the\nrise and fall of the \"original package\" doctrine).\n\n                                   -20-\n\fthis manner is in effect a customs duty.\"               Id.    Puerto Rico was\n\nthus hindered in its efforts to levy the tax, and Congress amended\n\nSection 3 of the Federal Relations Act \"[f]or the purpose of\n\nrighting this situation.\"          Id.    The change gave express authority\n\nto federal officials to aid in the collection of the tax, and\n\nclarified that incoming articles were subject to Puerto Rico's\n\ntaxing jurisdiction \"as soon as\" they entered the island (whether\n\narriving   from     the   United     States      mainland     or   from    foreign\n\ncountries).      It neutralized \"the regulatory effect of the customs\n\nlaws and regulations in so far as they protected articles from\n\nlocal taxation after their arrival.\"             West India, 311 U.S. at 28.\n\n           Just as Congress did not have in mind the authority\n\nclaimed by Puerto Rico in this case, neither is there evidence that\n\nCongress   had    this    scheme    in    mind   when   it    enacted      the   FAA\n\nAuthorization Act. We are left with two different federal statutes\n\n(the Federal Relations Act and the FAA Authorization Act), neither\n\nof which specifically address the issues raised in this case.                    As\n\nto these issues, therefore, neither statute has any automatic\n\npriority over the other.\n\n           In our view, the Federal Relations Act and the FAA\n\nAuthorization Act can co-exist harmoniously. Our analysis proceeds\n\ndown a well worn path: where two federal statutes are alleged to be\n\nin conflict, we look to whether they touch upon the same subject,\n\nand if so, whether we can give effect to both statutes.                   See Rhode\n\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\fIsland v. Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d 685, 703 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).    We   are   further   guided   by   the   familiar     principle   of\n\nconstruction that implied repeals are disfavored.             Id.   Here, the\n\nstatutes at issue address two very different subjects: Puerto\n\nRico's taxing authority on the one hand and deregulation of the air\n\ntransportation industry on the other.\n\n          The Federal Relations Act does not suggest that Puerto\n\nRico is   empowered    to   impose   restrictions    on   the    delivery of\n\npackages by private carriers.        The legislative history describing\n\nthe purpose of the 1927 amendment includes the observation that\n\nCongress expected that the government of Puerto Rico would \"make\n\nuse of this power so as not to unnecessarily place any barriers in\n\nthe way of the free-trade conditions now existing\" between Puerto\n\nRico and the mainland United States, \"which is [a] principal factor\n\nin the progress and prosperity of P[ue]rto Rico.\"               H.R. Rep. No.\n\n1370, at 2 (1926); S. Rep. No. 1011, at 2 (1926).                   We do not\n\ninterpret the statute as conferring a broad authority to regulate\n\nthe flow of packages in interstate commerce that conflicts with the\n\nFAA Authorization Act.         To do so would be to manufacture a\n\nstatutory conflict where none exists.\n\n          As a practical matter, it is not the case that the\n\nSecretary's exercise of his taxing authority necessitates the\n\nregulation of packages entering Puerto Rico.         Packages arriving by\n\nU.S. mail are delivered without interference, and recipients are\n\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\frequired to pay any applicable tax within 48 hours.                See 13 P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. § 9068.               The Secretary has introduced no evidence\n\nsuggesting        why    this    approach   (or    some   other   legislatively\n\nestablished process) would not be suitable for packages arriving by\n\nair carrier.        Nor has he put forth a rational explanation for\n\ntreating these two forms of delivery so differently.16\n\n             2.             Legislative Intent to Preempt\n\n             The Secretary's second major argument is that Congress\n\ndid not intend to preempt the challenged scheme, which either falls\n\noutside the scope of the preemption clause of the FAA Authorization\n\nAct, or is preserved under other provisions of federal law.                 So,\n\nthe reasoning goes, the district court construed too broadly the\n\nscope of the FAA Authorization Act's express preemption provision,\n\nwhich provides that no state may\n\n     [E]nact or         enforce a law, regulation, or other provision\n     having the         force and effect of a law related to a price,\n     route, or          service of an air carrier . . . when such\n     carrier is         transporting property by aircraft or by motor\n     vehicle.\n\n49 U.S.C. § 41713 (emphasis added).               In determining the scope of\n\nthis provision, we look to Congress's intent, which is revealed in\n\n\n\n     16\n      Instead of addressing whether packages delivered by air\ncarriers ought to be treated in the same manner as those delivered\nby the U.S. mail, the Secretary appears to contend that he lacks\nauthority to impose comparable regulations on the U.S. postal\nsystem, which is within the \"exclusive domain of Congress.\"\nWhether or not this is true, the plain language of Section 3 of the\nFederal Relations Act instructs federal postal employees to aid\nlocal officers in the collection of the tax. 48 U.S.C. § 741a.\n\n                                        -23-\n\fthe language of the provision, as well as the structure and purpose\n\nof the statute.    See Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504\n\nU.S. 374, 383 (1992)(interpreting the statutory predecessor to §\n\n41713).17    Setting   aside   those   portions   of   the   statute   that\n\nindisputably apply to the facts of the current case,18 the crux of\n\nthe matter is whether the laws at issue are \"related to a price,\n\nroute, or service\" of UPS.\n\n            The phrase \"related to\" has a broad meaning in ordinary\n\nusage: \"to stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to\n\npertain; refer; to bring into association or connection with.\" Id.\n\n(quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1158 (5th ed. 1979)). When used in\n\n     17\n      The language of the preemption provision considered by the\nMorales Court varied slightly from the language of 49 U.S.C. §\n41713. There is reason to think the intervening amendments did not\nnarrow the provision's broad preemptive effect:\n\n    In substituting the word \"related\" for the prior word\n    \"relating\" and the word \"price\" for the word \"rates\" we\n    are intending no substantive change to the previously\n    enacted preemption provision in Section 105 of the\n    Federal Aviation Act and do not intend to impair the\n    applicability of prior judicial case law interpreting\n    these provisions. In particular, the conferees do not\n    intend to alter the broad preemption interpretation\n    adopted by the United States Supreme Court in Morales v.\n    TransWorld Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. [374], 199 L.Ed. 157,\n    112 S.Ct 2031 (1992).\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 103-240, at 83 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n1676, 1755.\n\n     18\n      The statute applies to Puerto Rico, which is included within\nthe definition of \"state.\" Further, the Secretary does not deny\nthat the challenged restrictions are \"law[s]\" and \"regulation[s],\"\nnor that UPS is an \"air carrier\" within the meaning of the statute.\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\fa preemption provision such as § 41713, it has a similarly broad\n\nreach.    State laws and regulations \"having a connection with or\n\nreference to\" an air carrier's prices, routes or services are\n\npreempted under § 41713.      See id. at 384.      A sufficient nexus\n\nexists if the law expressly references the air carrier's prices,\n\nroutes or services, or has a \"forbidden significant effect\" upon\n\nthe same. Id. at 388.    This interpretation is consistent with the\n\npurpose   animating   the   FAA    Authorization    Act    and   Airline\n\nDeregulation Act, which sought to prevent states from interfering\n\nwith the goal of federal deregulation of air transportation by\n\nimposing regulations of their own.       See id. at 378.\n\n           In his attempt to circumscribe the breadth of this\n\ninterpretation, the Secretary suggests that only statutes and\n\nregulations that \"seek to set, control or manipulate\" an air\n\ncarrier's prices, routes, or services are preempted by the FAA\n\nAuthorization Act.      This narrower interpretation would read the\n\n\"related to\" language out of the statute, an approach expressly\n\nrejected by the Supreme Court.19    See id. at 385 (\"Had the statute\n\n     19\n      The Secretary argues that the broad preemption standard\nadopted in Morales has been overruled by a number of Supreme Court\ncases narrowing the preemptive effect of the Employment Retirement\nIncome Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a).

While the Morales\nCourt undoubtedly took its interpretive cues from the ERISA\npreemption jurisprudence then in existence, it does not follow that\nany change in ERISA law necessitates a parallel change in the law\n\n                                  -25-\n\fbeen designed to pre-empt state law in such a limited fashion, it\n\nwould have forbidden the states to 'regulate rates, routes and\n\nservices.'\").\n\n          The challenged scheme both refers to and has a forbidden\n\nsignificant effect on UPS's prices, routes or services.               Section\n\n9066 -- the linchpin of the scheme -- forbids delivery unless and\n\nuntil a recipient produces a certificate from the Secretary.\n\nCompliance with this provision significantly affects the timeliness\n\nand effectiveness of UPS's service, which includes the delivery of\n\npackages on an express or time-guaranteed basis.              Likewise, the\n\nprepayment mechanism imposes extensive requirements that must be\n\nmet   before    a   carrier   may    make    a   lawful   delivery.     These\n\nrequirements create a substantial burden on UPS, in the form of\n\nadditional labor, costs, and delays.             The undisputed record, as\n\nchronicled by the district court below, shows that this burden\n\ndirectly and significantly affects UPS's routes and services, which\n\ndepend upon an orderly flow of packages.            United Parcel Service,\n\n210 F. Supp. 2d at 38-40.           The costs of this scheme necessarily\n\nhave a negative effect on UPS's prices.           See Federal Express Corp.\n\nv. California Pub. Util. Comm'n, 936 F.2d 1075, 1078 (9th Cir.\n\n1991) (\"Terms of service determine cost.            To regulate them is to\n\n\naffecting air carriers. As Judge Easterbrook has put it: \"[I]f\ndevelopments in pension law have undercut holdings in air-\ntransportation law, it is for the Supreme Court itself to make the\nadjustment. Our marching orders are clear: follow decisions until\nthe Supreme Court overrules them.\" United Airlines, Inc. v. Mesa\nAirlines, Inc., 219 F.3d 605, 608 (7th Cir. 2000).\n\n                                      -26-\n\faffect the price.\"). In view of the uncontroverted record, we must\n\nconclude that the challenged scheme falls within the scope of the\n\nFAA Authorization Act's preemption provision.\n\n           Against the weight of this authority, the Secretary\n\nargues for a presumption against preemption. This presumption only\n\narises, however, if Congress legislates in a field traditionally\n\noccupied by the states.   United States v. Locke, 529 U.S. 89, 108\n\n(2000) (citing Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230\n\n(1947)).   The Secretary does not dispute that there has been a\n\nlongstanding federal presence in the field of air transportation.\n\nInstead, he says that the relevant field is \"state taxation.\"       We\n\nthink our earlier analysis of the Butler Act puts to rest the\n\nquestion of whether our task is to determine the validity of a\n\nCommonwealth tax.   On the contrary, our task is to determine the\n\npreemptive effect of the FAA Authorization Act within the field of\n\nair   transportation.     No   presumption   against   preemption   is\n\nappropriate in this case because of Congress's significant -- and\n\nundisputed -- presence in the field of air transportation.20\n\n           In the face of the \"specific substantive pre-emption\n\nprovision\" of the FAA Authorization Act, Morales, 504 U.S. at 385,\n\nthe Secretary also asks us to conclude that the challenged scheme\n\n      20\n      The Secretary likewise urges us to conclude that preemption\nshould not occur here, because, in adopting and enforcing the\nscheme, Puerto Rico is merely acting within a \"sphere of authority\"\nunder a \"dual system of federal and state regulation.\" Again, the\nSecretary insists that the relevant field is \"taxation,\" which we\nreject for the reasons discussed above.\n\n                                -27-\n\fsurvives by virtue of other provisions of federal law or the FAA\n\nAuthorization Act's legislative history.     First, he points to 26\n\nU.S.C. § 7653, a provision of the Internal Revenue Code that\n\nsubjects articles manufactured in the mainland United States to a\n\ntax at the port of entry in Puerto Rico that is equal to (in rate\n\nand amount) the tax imposed upon articles manufactured in Puerto\n\nRico.   Like Section 3 of the Federal Relations Act, this provision\n\nprevents discriminatory taxation in favor of merchandise produced\n\nin Puerto Rico. Cf. 26 U.S.C. § 7652(a)(1) (subjecting articles of\n\nPuerto Rican manufacture entering the mainland United States to \"a\n\ntax equal to the internal revenue tax imposed in the United States\n\nupon the like articles of domestic manufacture\").      It is not a\n\nblanket authorization for Puerto Rico to regulate the delivery of\n\ngoods. Indeed, Puerto Rico allows the unrestricted delivery of\n\ntaxable merchandise through the U.S. mail.\n\n           The Secretary also looks to the FAA Authorization Act's\n\nlegislative history for support for his position, in particular a\n\nstatement that \"nothing in this amendment is intended to change the\n\napplication of State tax laws to motor carriers.\"   H.R. Conf. Rep.\n\nNo. 103-677 at 85 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1676,\n\n1757.   Even if we were bound by this fragment of the legislative\n\nhistory, the Secretary's interpretation of it is not consistent\n\nwith its plain language, or with the overall purpose of the\n\nlegislation.    The   taxes at issue in the case before us are\n\n\n\n                               -28-\n\fgenerally applicable excise taxes, not taxes on motor carriers.\n\nMoreover, the regulatory authority retained by the states was not\n\n\"to be used as a guise for continued economic regulation as it\n\nrelates to prices, routes or services.\"       H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-\n\n677 at 84 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1676, 1756.\n\n          Finally,   the   Secretary    contends   that   the   challenged\n\nscheme survives under the Federal Anti-Head Tax Act, 49 U.S.C. §\n\n40116(e) (formerly 49 U.S.C. § 1513(b)), a provision that he\n\ncharacterizes as a \"savings clause.\"       This statute prohibits the\n\nstates from imposing a tax or \"head charge\" on air transportation,\n\nincluding taxes on air passengers and gross receipts from air\n\ntransportation.   See id. § 40116(b).      The provision on which the\n\nSecretary relies, § 40116(e), preserves the right of the states to\n\ncollect those taxes not otherwise barred by the statute.          Far from\n\na clear manifestation of congressional intent to permit Puerto\n\nRico's ban on delivery, this broad provision merely preserves\n\ncertain rights of taxation already held by the states.          It creates\n\nno new rights for Puerto Rico, and adds nothing to the analysis\n\nwhere, as here, the right of Puerto Rico to levy and collect the\n\nexcise tax is undisputed.21\n\n     21\n      Although we address the merits of the Secretary's arguments\nregarding these federal provisions (i.e. portions of the Internal\nRevenue Code, the legislative history of the FAA Authorization Act,\nor the Anti-Head Tax Act), we note that the Secretary raises these\nissues for the first time on appeal. See Higgins v. New Balance\nAthletic Shoe, Inc., 194 F.3d 252, 259 (1st Cir. 1999)(\"[A]bsent\nexceptional circumstances, not present here -- we consider on\nappeal only arguments that were before the nisi prius court\").\n\n                                 -29-\n\fC.          The Scope of the Injunction\n\n            Beyond the issue of whether injunctive relief is proper\n\nin this case -- a question we answer in the affirmative -- lies the\n\nissue of whether the particular relief granted was appropriate.            A\n\ndistrict court has broad discretion to fashion an appropriate\n\nequitable   remedy,   but   the   relief   imposed   should   be   \"no   more\n\nburdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete\n\nrelief to the plaintiffs.\"        Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682\n\n(1979); Tamko Roofing Products, Inc. v. Ideal Roofing Co., Ltd.,\n\n282 F.3d 23, 40 (1st Cir. 2002).          Both the Secretary and UPS (in\n\nits cross-appeal) challenge the scope of the injunction, alleging\n\nthat it goes too far or not far enough depending on the point of\n\nview.22\n\n            While several of the parties' submissions touched on\n\nmatters relevant to the remedy question, the scope issues discussed\n\nbelow were not fully briefed by the parties in anticipation of the\n\n\n\n\n     22\n      In particular, the Secretary contends that the injunction\nshould not extend to 13 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 8102, 9060, 9061, 9064,\nor any provision affecting the \"motor vehicles\" or \"household\ngoods\" exceptions to 49 U.S.C. § 41713(b)(4)(B)(i)-(ii).       UPS\ncontends that the injunction should have precluded enforcement of\na licensing provision, 13 P.R. Laws Ann. § 9059, a proposition\ndisputed by the Secretary on appeal. The Secretary also challenges\nthe district court's invalidation of the $14.24 million\nadministrative fine through the injunction, an issue we treat as\ndistinct from the question of which statutes and regulations ought\nto be enjoined and address separately below.\n\n                                   -30-\n\finjunction.23   In view of the public policy implications of this\n\ncase, we conclude that the parties should be afforded an additional\n\nopportunity to present the court with their positions as to the\n\nnature and scope of the remedy.    We therefore affirm in principle\n\npart but remand on three selected issues for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n          The issues to be addressed on remand should be limited to\n\nthose pertaining to the scope of the district court's injunction\n\nthat the parties have briefed and argued on appeal.   Of these, the\n\none that seems closest is whether the court is now empowered to,\n\nand should, invalidate the $14.24 million administrative fine\n\nimposed by the Secretary during the course of this litigation.   As\n\npreviously noted, the court enjoined the Secretary from enforcing\n\nthe fine because it thought the sanction had been imposed pursuant\n\nto the preempted legal regime.    On appeal, the Secretary says that\n\nthe court did not appreciate that the fine was imposed under the\n\nshort-lived Act No. 322 (and not the preempted regime), and that,\n\nbecause UPS has not yet exhausted its state remedies with respect\n\nto the fine, the court should have abstained under Younger v.\n\nHarris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), and related comity-based doctrines.\n\nUPS responds that the fine was indeed imposed (for retaliatory\n\nreasons) pursuant to the preempted regime, and that the Secretary's\n\n     23\n      Perhaps this was because the district court, in cancelling\nthe October 1, 2001 hearing, used language suggesting that there\nwould be an opportunity for further argument and record development\nin connection with any injunction it might enter.\n\n                                 -31-\n\fother    arguments    are   therefore    beside   the   point.     Because   a\n\nsubstantial amount of money is at stake and more comprehensive\n\nbriefing and record development may be helpful, prudence dictates\n\nthat the district court be afforded an opportunity to revisit the\n\nmatter after hearing from the parties.\n\n            The second issue open to revisiting on remand is whether\n\nthe statutory savings clauses that allow states to regulate motor\n\nvehicle safety and the transportation of household goods, 49 U.S.C.\n\n§ 41713(b)(4)(B)(i)-(ii), should limit the scope of the injunction.\n\nIt is not clear that the Secretary presented any argument below on\n\nthe basis of these clauses and, to the extent they are relied upon\n\nas grounds for a claim that no injunction should issue, the claim\n\nis forfeited.        See Higgins, 194 F.3d at 259.          This would not\n\nnecessarily be true so far as the clauses are relied upon for\n\npurposes of arguing for a narrower injunction; but we are at a loss\n\nto understand how either clause might curtail the relief sought by\n\nUPS, and the Secretary's brief is not very enlightening on this\n\npoint.    If the Secretary has some serious argument as to how the\n\ninjunction needs minor modifications on account of these clauses,\n\nwe do not foreclose him from presenting such an argument on remand.\n\nBut it is not yet apparent that the Secretary has such an argument.\n\n            Finally,    the   district   court    originally     described   as\n\npreempted and then reinstated 13 P.R. Laws Ann. § 9059, which\n\nimposes a licensing fee of $2000 per year on air carriers.            UPS has\n\n\n\n                                    -32-\n\fcross-appealed, citing authorities suggesting that other courts\n\nhave found similar licensing fees to be preempted by the FAA\n\nAuthorization Act.       The issue is not directly addressed by the\n\ndistrict court and, in view of the remand on other issues, we think\n\nit would be useful to have the district court's explanation of its\n\nposition clarified before the matter is reviewed.                  We thus leave\n\nthe district court free in the first instance to affirm or modify\n\nthe injunction, with respect to § 9059, as it finds appropriate.\n\n                            III.       Conclusion\n\n           For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's   amended   judgment     but    remand   as    to    the   three   issues\n\nidentified above, as to which our affirmance is provisional, and we\n\nretain jurisdiction for any further appellate proceedings that may\n\nbe required.   Central Maine Power Co. v. FERC, 252 F.3d 34, 48 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).\n\n           The district court is directed to address and resolve the\n\nthree remaining issues within 120 days of the date of this decision\n\nand is at liberty to modify the injunction as may be required by\n\nthe   resolution    of   those   issues,      any     such   resolution     being\n\nreviewable by a timely filed new appeal or appeals in accordance\n\nwith usual practice.      A copy of the district court's new decision\n\nshall be filed with the clerk of this court and transmitted to this\n\npanel.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -33-\n\f          The stay of the injunction pending appeal previously\n\nissued by this court is vacated forthwith. Further, the mandate of\n\nthis court shall issue forthwith.     In re Grand Jury Proceedings,\n\n183 F.3d 71, 79 (1st Cir. 1999).

Plaintiffs United Parcel Service, Inc., and United Parcel Service, Co., (collectively \"UPS\") persuaded the district court to enjoin the Commonwealth's Treasury Secretary from enforcing these delivery restrictions on the grounds of federal preemption. The parties have filed cross-appeals which raise difficult questions about the lawfulness and proper scope of the injunction in light of arguably conflicting federal statutes that, on the one hand, strip the district court of jurisdiction to entertain suits seeking to restrain the collection of any Puerto Rico tax and authorize the Commonwealth to exercise taxing jurisdiction over packages as soon as they enter the island, and, on the other hand, limit the Commonwealth's ability to regulate an air carrier's service. In the end, we affirm the court's central ruling but remand for reconsideration of several peripheral matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before us, Defendant Juan A. Flores-Galarza, in his official capacity as the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the \"Secretary\"), contends that the district court erred in finding that it had jurisdiction over the controversy, that Puerto Rico's restrictions on delivery were preempted by federal law, and that an administrative fine imposed by the Secretary was invalid and unenforceable. The Secretary also makes an alternative argument that the injunction is overbroad. UPS's cross-appeal challenges the district court's exclusion from the scope of the injunction a statutory provision requiring the payment of license fees by air carriers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs are corporate affiliates with common controlling ownership engaged in the delivery of packages worldwide. United Parcel Service Co. is authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration to operate as an air carrier for the transportation of property, and United Parcel Service, Inc. is engaged in the transportation of property by motor vehicle. UPS offers door-to-door delivery service and the delivery of packages on an express or time-guaranteed basis. In certain circumstances, UPS refunds delivery charges for express packages that have not been timely delivered. UPS ships approximately 10,000 packages per day to Puerto Rico from the continental United States. UPS's delivery operations function as an integrated system, requiring extensive planning and coordination among its operating facilities, ground fleet, and air fleet. Delays and disruptions in operations can affect thousands of packages in transit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico imposes an excise tax<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> on \"articles of use and consumption,\" including those introduced from elsewhere. 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 9005. The general tax rate is 5 percent of the taxable price, although the rate varies depending on the article, and there are numerous exemptions. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 9015, 9031. No interstate carrier transporting a package subject to an excise levied by the Commonwealth may deliver the package to its intended recipient unless the recipient (the \"consignee\") presents a certificate from the Department of the Treasury evidencing payment of the requisite tax. 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 9066 (\"&#167; 9066\"). If a carrier delivers a package without obtaining this certificate, the carrier may be required to pay an administrative fine to the Secretary, a tax on the package's contents, and any surcharges and interest accrued from the date the items were introduced into Puerto Rico. <i>See id.; see also</i> 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 8080(a), 8140(6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an alternative to the certificate system established by &#167; 9066, carriers such as UPS may prepay the taxes owed, deliver the packages, and seek reimbursement from the packages' consignees. 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 9077; Article 6.005 of Regulations for the Administration and Enforcement of the Excise Tax of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the \"Articles\"). To take advantage of this alternative, carriers must comply with a complex statutory and regulatory scheme resembling the federal customs system. Carriers must provide the Department of the Treasury, on a daily basis, a commercial invoice for each package that describes the package's contents and their cost, as well as a \"shipment manifest\" that lists packages by specific categories. <i>See</i> 1994 Procedure for Freight Air and Ocean Forwarders Who Are Authorized for the Secretary of the Treasury to Pay Taxes and Take Credit for Articles Returned or Paid In Excess or Improperly (\"1994 Procedure\") &#182;&#182; 1-4, 8, 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, carriers who prepay taxes must make packages available for inspection by Treasury agents, and give the agents access to their facilities to supervise the processing of packages. <i>See</i> 1994 Procedure &#182; 10.

Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 8102, 8140(1); Articles 5.005(7),(11), 6.005.

UPS also bears the burden of seeking reimbursement from consignees, pays additional amounts if agents alter assessments on packages after they have been delivered, and maintains a $1.5 million bond.

It did so after reaching the preliminary conclusion that the existing scheme might be in conflict with federal law. <i>See</i> S. Res. 917, 13th Leg. Assem., 2d Ord. Sess. (P.R.1997). Two years later, the Puerto Rico legislature confirmed this conclusion, finding that numerous laws and regulations, including those of the local excise tax system, were impacting or affecting the prices, routes and services of air carriers and affiliated motor carriers. <i>See</i> Act No. 322, 13th Leg.

In November 1999, the legislature passed Act 322, which would allow air carriers to transport packages to consignees without restriction, and require consignees to pay the excise tax within two business days. <i>Id.</i> Under Act 322, air carriers would provide the Secretary with \"the minimum information agreed as necessary in order for the Secretary to proceed to collect the excise taxes, without unreasonably interfering in the ordinary course of business in interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> This new legislation also exempted air carriers from licensing requirements. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provisions of Act 322 removing impediments to the delivery of packages would not become effective until June 30, 2001. The legislature concluded that the intervening period would be sufficient for the Department of the Treasury to develop and implement an alternative system consistent with federal law. <i>See id.</i> In the interim, Act 322 provided immediate relief for air carriers by authorizing them to withhold five percent of the taxes they prepaid to the Secretary to defray the costs associated with the existing system. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Act 322's provisions allowing unrestricted delivery were effective for only two business days before the statute was repealed. In July 2001, the Puerto Rico legislature reinstated the &#167; 9066 conditional ban on delivery, as well as the prepayment alternative. During the two business days that Act 322 was effective, UPS delivered packages without collecting excise taxes. UPS provided the Secretary with commercial invoices for each package delivered during those days, which included some, but not all, of the information previously required to be included in daily \"shipment manifests.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day that Act 322 was repealed, July 3, 2001, UPS brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico to enjoin the enforcement of those statutes and regulations affecting its delivery of packages. In its complaint, UPS alleged that Puerto Rico's restrictions on delivery were preempted by the FAA Authorization Act and therefore violated the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> UPS also alleged that the scheme violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &#167; 8, cl.3; Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, cl. 1.; and Takings Clause, U.S. Const. amend. V.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the weeks immediately following the filing of the complaint, the Secretary directed UPS to turn over shipping manifests for the two-day period in July 2001 when Act 322 was in effect. UPS agreed to do so, but only on the condition that the information would not be used in connection with the pending litigation. The Secretary rejected this offer. On November 26, 2001, the Secretary issued an administrative fine against UPS of $14.24 million, citing UPS's failure to provide certain information allegedly \"agreed upon\" at a meeting of the parties on June 29, 2001. This amount represented a $1000 fine for each package delivered, based on the Secretary's estimate that approximately 7120 packages were processed each day. UPS made a timely request for reconsideration and an administrative hearing, reserving its right to contest the validity of the fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to pursuing its administrative remedies, UPS requested that the district court grant a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to prevent the Secretary from enforcing the challenged scheme or the administrative fine. In December 2001, the district court denied this request, concluding that UPS failed to demonstrate that it would suffer irreparable harm if forced to seek relief at the administrative level or that bypassing the administrative process was justified under the circumstances. In reaching its decision, the district court found that the fine arose from a dispute over the information that the parties \"purportedly agreed\" would be provided to the Secretary. UPS appealed the district court's decision to this Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By March 2002, the Secretary had not responded to a motion for summary judgment filed by UPS in August 2001, prior to the emergence of the administrative fine controversy. The district court ordered the Secretary to file an opposition by March 21, 2002.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The Secretary opposed UPS's motion for summary judgment on April 8, 2002, but failed to submit any statement of contested material facts as required by Local Rule 311.12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2002, the district court issued a series of opinions and orders that, collectively, granted summary judgment in favor of UPS and held that the FAA Authorization Act preempted Puerto Rico's statutory and regulatory scheme affecting the delivery of packages. The district court permanently enjoined the enforcement of all statutory and regulatory provisions challenged by UPS except 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 9059, a licensing requirement referenced in UPS's summary judgment papers but not expressly included within UPS's request for relief. The district court also invalidated the $14.24 million administrative fine imposed by the Secretary on the ground that it was imposed pursuant to the preempted scheme. The district court based its decision on the papers filed by the parties, and did not convene a hearing before imposing the injunction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary appealed, and UPS cross-appealed solely to the extent the district court excluded the licensing provision, &#167; 9059, from the scope of the permanent injunction. UPS also obtained a voluntary dismissal of its appeal to this Court on the issue of enforcement of the administrative fine. <i>See</i> note 6, above. In July 2002, at the request of the Secretary, this Court granted a stay of the permanent injunction pending resolution of the appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We replay a familiar refrain. Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>Rochester Ford Sales, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> 287 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir.2002). We review <i>de novo</i> the district court's grant of summary judgment. <i>See id.</i> In so doing, we construe the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, resolving all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. <i>See id.</i> Here, however, the district court, acting within its discretion to manage its cases, accepted the uncontested facts submitted by UPS because of the Secretary's failure to comply with Local Rule 311.12 in its opposition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> <i>See A.M. Capen's Co., Inc. v. American Trading and Prod., Corp.,</i> 202 F.3d 469, (1st Cir.2000). Because we confine our review to the record at the time the district court made its ruling on the motion for summary judgment, the facts set forth in UPS's motion for summary judgment are not in dispute. <i>See id.</i> Those facts not included in UPS's statement, specifically those facts relating to the administrative fine imposed after UPS sought summary judgment, are considered in the light most favorable to the Secretary. <i>See Rochester Ford,</i> 287 F.3d at 38. We review the district court's grant of injunctive relief \"in so far as it involves no question of law\" for abuse of discretion. <i>Conservation Law Found., Inc. v. Busey,</i> 79 F.3d 1250, 1256 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Federal Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold issue, the Secretary contends that a provision of the Butler Act, codified at 48 U.S.C. &#167; 872,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> deprived the district court of jurisdiction over the action filed by UPS. Under the Butler Act, \"[n]o suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of a tax imposed by the laws of Puerto Rico shall be maintained in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.\" 48 U.S.C. &#167; 872. For the reasons that follow, the prohibition does not apply to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary contends that UPS has challenged the statutory and regulatory mechanism for collecting the excise tax, thus UPS seeks to restrain the assessment or collection of the tax within the meaning of the Butler Act. But the action initiated by UPS sought to enjoin only those provisions of the laws and regulations of Puerto Rico that prohibit or interfere with the delivery of packages. UPS did not challenge the amount or validity of the excise tax, nor the authority of the Secretary to assess or collect it. The relief sought by UPS leaves the Secretary free to collect the tax from those who owe it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not every statutory or regulatory obligation that may aid the Secretary's ability to collect a tax is immune from attack in federal court by virtue of the Butler Act's jurisdictional bar. <i>See Wells v. Malloy,</i> 510 F.2d 74, 76-77 (2d Cir.1975)(Friendly, J.)(action questioning the constitutionality of a statute providing for suspension of a driver's license for failure to pay motor vehicle taxes did not constitute an attempt to restrain the assessment or levy of the tax); <i>see also Mobil Oil Corp. v. Tully,</i> 639 F.2d 912, 918 (2d Cir.1981)(holding that the \"mere fact that the [challenged provision] is contained in a tax law of the State should not lead to automatic sanctuary\" under the Tax Injunction Act). Such an interpretation extends the concept of tax collection, and therefore the breadth of the Butler Act, too far. <i>See Wells,</i> 510 F.2d at 77 (rejecting as overbroad an interpretation of tax collection that would include \"anything that a state has determined to be a likely method of securing payment\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the Tax Injunction Act, the Butler Act's jurisdictional bar extends to</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">cases where taxpayers were repeatedly using the federal courts to raise questions of state or federal law going to the validity of the particular taxes imposed upon them &#8212; not to a case where a taxpayer contended that an unusual sanction for non-payment of a tax admittedly due violated his constitutional rights, an issue which, once determined, would be determined for him and all others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (notation omitted). Admittedly, the conditional ban on package deliveries may not seem to be in some respects as unusual as the drivers' license penalty in <i>Wells.</i> Nevertheless, because the delivery ban targets third parties instead of those who owe the tax, this is not a prototypical Tax Injunction Act or Butler Act case. UPS does not seek to restrain a system that \"produce[s] money or other property directly.\" <i>Id.</i> Instead, by exposing commercial carriers to fines and penalties (including the loss of their license to do business in Puerto Rico) if they choose to deliver a package without collecting a certificate from the recipient, &#167; 9066 produces tax money \"indirectly through a more general use of coercive power,\" <i>id.,</i> using the threat of sanctions against private parties who do not even owe the taxes at issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> This is not a system of tax collection within the meaning of the Butler Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that commercial carriers have the option &#8212; a perhaps generous characterization &#8212; to participate in the alternative prepayment system does not alter the equation. The prepayment alternative would have no teeth independent of the &#167; 9066 ban on service. It may thus be the case that, for all practical purposes, commercial carriers have been conscripted into making payments on behalf of taxpayers, thereby promoting the Secretary's revenue raising efficiency as a condition of doing business. But we should not deny a federal forum to a party challenging the constitutionality of this system on the ground that an adverse ruling could make the Secretary's job harder.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Preemption under the FAA Authorization Act</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Urging that Puerto Rico's restrictions on delivery are not preempted by the FAA Authorization Act, the Secretary advances two principal arguments. First, the Secretary notes that Puerto Rico has a special taxing power under Section 3 of the Federal Relations Act, 48 U.S.C. &#167; 741a. According to the Secretary, the FAA Authorization Act cannot be read to limit this unique taxing authority by preempting statutes and regulations that merely implement it. Second, the Secretary contends that Congress did not intend to preempt the challenged statutes and regulations, which either fall outside the scope of the FAA Authorization Act's preemptive effect or are preserved under other provisions of federal law. Although ably pressed, both of these arguments ultimately come up short.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Role of the Federal Relations Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3 of the Federal Relations Act provides in part that any excise tax imposed by Puerto Rico \"may be levied and collected ... as soon as the [taxable items] are manufactured, sold, used, or brought into the island.\" 48 U.S.C. &#167; 741a. The Secretary says that the parcel delivery requirements merely implement Puerto Rico's taxing authority under the Federal Relations Act. So, he argues, \"this case does not involve a state statute that is subject to preemption by a federal statute,\" but instead involves only the interface between two federal statutes, the FAA Authorization Act and the Federal Relations Act. The case would thus turn on whether the FAA Authorization Act impliedly repealed the Federal Relations Act. The Secretary says it did not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pointing to Congress's 1927 addition of the language that the excise tax may be levied \"as soon as\" taxable goods are brought into Puerto Rico, and that U.S. Customs and Postal Service officials \"are directed to assist the appropriate officials of the Puerto Rican government in the collection of these taxes,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> 48 U.S.C. &#167; 741a, the Secretary contends that Puerto Rico has specific Congressional authorization to restrict the delivery of packages as necessary to collect the excise tax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken alone, Section 3 would seem to strengthen the Secretary's hand in challenges to the tax and perhaps even its \"no delivery\" feature, at least as to those challenges based on the Commerce Clause. In practice, Puerto Rico has wielded a unique power as a result of the Federal Relations Act. In the years following the 1927 amendment, Puerto Rico succeeded in imposing a state tax on oil imported into bonded warehouses where New York failed &#8212; the critical distinction between the two taxes being the specific taxing authority of Puerto Rico under the Federal Relations Act. <i>Compare West India Oil Co. v. Domenech,</i> 311 U.S. 20, 25-27, 61 S.Ct. 90, 85 L.Ed. 16 (1940)(permitting Puerto Rico to impose tax on fuel oil imported into bonded warehouses because of Puerto Rico's taxing authority under 48 U.S.C. &#167; 741a), <i>with McGoldrick v. Gulf Oil Corp.,</i> 309 U.S. 414, 60 S.Ct. 664, 84 L.Ed. 840, (1940) (invalidating a New York sales tax imposed on crude oil imported into warehouses under bond because of its conflict with federal statutes occupying the field). The <i>West India</i> Court allowed Puerto Rico to impose the tax, despite federal statutes enacted after the Federal Relations Act and its 1927 amendment indicating Congress's intent to regulate bonded warehouses. <i>See West India,</i> 311 U.S. at 29, 61 S.Ct. 90 (\"[C]onsidering the relationship of general Congressional legislation to legislation specifically applicable to our territories, and possessions, repeals by implication are not to be favored and will not be adjudged unless the legislative intention to repeal is clear.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Section 3 of the Federal Relations Act's reach, there does not appear to be any evidence that Congress focused at all on the delivery bar issue, much less intended a specific endorsement of a scheme in which carriers were to be barred from making deliveries until they produced certificates that as a practical matter could not be done on a widespread basis. Congress intended that the 1927 amendment to the Federal Relations Act resolve existing controversy over whether taxes could be imposed on goods still in their original packaging.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 1370, at 2 (1926); S.Rep. No. 1011, at 2 (1926) Previously, courts had held that U.S. Customs and Postal Service officials could not withhold delivery of incoming articles, \"as such tax collected in this manner is in effect a customs duty.\" <i>Id.</i> Puerto Rico was thus hindered in its efforts to levy the tax, and Congress amended Section 3 of the Federal Relations Act \"[f]or the purpose of righting this situation.\" <i>Id.</i> The change gave express authority to federal officials to aid in the collection of the tax, and clarified that incoming articles were subject to Puerto Rico's taxing jurisdiction \"as soon as\" they entered the island (whether arriving from the United States mainland or from foreign countries). It neutralized \"the regulatory effect of the customs laws and regulations in so far as they protected articles from local taxation after their arrival.\" <i>West India,</i> 311 U.S. at 28, 61 S.Ct. 90.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just as Congress did not have in mind the authority claimed by Puerto Rico in this case, neither is there evidence that Congress had this scheme in mind when it enacted the FAA Authorization Act. We are left with two different federal statutes (the Federal Relations Act and the FAA Authorization Act), neither of which specifically address the issues raised in this case. As to these issues, therefore, neither statute has any automatic priority over the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the Federal Relations Act and the FAA Authorization Act can co-exist harmoniously. Our analysis proceeds down a well worn path: where two federal statutes are alleged to be in conflict, we look to whether they touch upon the same subject, and if so, whether we can give effect to both statutes. <i>See Rhode Island v. Narragansett Indian Tribe,</i> 19 F.3d 685, 703 (1st Cir.1994). We are further guided by the familiar principle of construction that implied repeals are disfavored. <i>Id.</i> Here, the statutes at issue address two very different subjects: Puerto Rico's taxing authority on the one hand and deregulation of the air transportation industry on the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Federal Relations Act does not suggest that Puerto Rico is empowered to impose restrictions on the <i>delivery</i> of packages by private carriers. The legislative history describing the purpose of the 1927 amendment includes the observation that Congress expected that the government of Puerto Rico would \"make use of this power so as not to unnecessarily place any barriers in the way of the free-trade conditions now existing\" between Puerto Rico and the mainland United States, \"which is [a] principal factor in the progress and prosperity of P[ue]rto Rico.\" H.R.Rep. No. 1370, at 2 (1926); S.Rep. No. 1011, at 2 (1926). We do not interpret the statute as conferring a broad authority to regulate the flow of packages in interstate commerce that conflicts with the FAA Authorization Act. To do so would be to manufacture a statutory conflict where none exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a practical matter, it is not the case that the Secretary's exercise of his taxing authority necessitates the regulation of packages entering Puerto Rico. Packages arriving by U.S. mail are delivered without interference, and recipients are required to pay any applicable tax within 48 hours. <i>See</i> 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 9068. The Secretary has introduced no evidence suggesting why this approach (or some other legislatively established process) would not be suitable for packages arriving by air carrier. Nor has he put forth a rational explanation for treating these two forms of delivery so differently.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Legislative Intent to Preempt</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's second major argument is that Congress did not intend to preempt the challenged scheme, which either falls outside the scope of the preemption clause of the FAA Authorization Act, or is preserved under other provisions of federal law. So, the reasoning goes, the district court construed too broadly the scope of the FAA Authorization Act's express preemption provision, which provides that no state may</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[E]nact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of a law <i>related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier</i> ... when such carrier is transporting property by aircraft or by motor vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">49 U.S.C. &#167; 41713 (emphasis added). In determining the scope of this provision, we look to Congress's intent, which is revealed in the language of the provision, as well as the structure and purpose of the statute. <i>See Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</i> 504 U.S. 374, 383, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992)(interpreting the statutory predecessor to &#167; 41713).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Setting aside those portions of the statute that indisputably apply to the facts of the current case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> the crux of the matter is whether the laws at issue are \"related to a price, route, or service\" of UPS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The phrase \"related to\" has a broad meaning in ordinary usage: \"to stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association or connection with.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1158 (5th ed.1979)). When used in a preemption provision such as &#167; 41713, it has a similarly broad reach. State laws and regulations \"having a connection with or reference to\" an air carrier's prices, routes or services are preempted under &#167; 41713. <i>See id.</i> at 384, 112 S.Ct. 2031. A sufficient nexus exists if the law expressly references the air carrier's prices, routes or services, or has a \"forbidden significant effect\" upon the same. <i>Id.</i> at 388, 112 S.Ct. 2031. This interpretation is consistent with the purpose animating the FAA Authorization Act and Airline Deregulation Act, which sought to prevent states from interfering with the goal of federal deregulation of air transportation by imposing regulations of their own. <i>See id.</i> at 378, 112 S.Ct. 2031.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his attempt to circumscribe the breadth of this interpretation, the Secretary suggests that only statutes and regulations that \"seek to set, control or manipulate\" an air carrier's prices, routes, or services are preempted by the FAA Authorization Act. This narrower interpretation would read the \"related to\" language out of the statute, an approach expressly rejected by the Supreme Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> <i>See id.</i> at 385, 112 S.Ct. 2031 (\"Had the statute been designed to pre-empt state law in such a limited fashion, it would have forbidden the states to `<i>regulate rates,</i> routes and services.'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenged scheme both refers to and has a forbidden significant effect on UPS's prices, routes or services. Section 9066 &#8212; the linchpin of the scheme &#8212; <i>forbids delivery</i> unless and until a recipient produces a certificate from the Secretary. Compliance with this provision significantly affects the timeliness and effectiveness of UPS's service, which includes the delivery of packages on an express or time-guaranteed basis. Likewise, the prepayment mechanism imposes extensive requirements that must be met before a carrier may make a lawful delivery. These requirements create a substantial burden on UPS, in the form of additional labor, costs, and delays. The undisputed record, as chronicled by the district court below, shows that this burden directly and significantly affects UPS's routes and services, which depend upon an orderly flow of packages. <i>United Parcel Service,</i> 210 F.Supp.2d at 38-40. The costs of this scheme necessarily have a negative effect on UPS's prices. <i>See Federal Express Corp. v. California Pub. Util. Comm'n,</i> 936 F.2d 1075, 1078 (9th Cir.1991) (\"Terms of service determine cost. To regulate them is to affect the price.\"). In view of the uncontroverted record, we must conclude that the challenged scheme falls within the scope of the FAA Authorization Act's preemption provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against the weight of this authority, the Secretary argues for a presumption against preemption. This presumption only arises, however, if Congress legislates in a field traditionally occupied by the states. <i>United States v. Locke,</i> 529 U.S. 89, 108, 120 S.Ct. 1135, 146 L.Ed.2d 69 (2000) (citing <i>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,</i> 331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 91 L.Ed. 1447 (1947)). The Secretary does not dispute that there has been a longstanding federal presence in the field of air transportation. Instead, he says that the relevant field is \"state taxation.\" We think our earlier analysis of the Butler Act puts to rest the question of whether our task is to determine the validity of a Commonwealth tax. On the contrary, our task is to determine the preemptive effect of the FAA Authorization Act within the field of air transportation. No presumption against preemption is appropriate in this case because of Congress's significant &#8212; and undisputed &#8212; presence in the field of air transportation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of the \"specific substantive pre-emption provision\" of the FAA Authorization Act, <i>Morales,</i> 504 U.S. at 385, 112 S.Ct. 2031, the Secretary also asks us to conclude that the challenged scheme survives by virtue of other provisions of federal law or the FAA Authorization Act's legislative history. First, he points to 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7653, a provision of the Internal Revenue Code that subjects articles manufactured in the mainland United States to a tax at the port of entry in Puerto Rico that is equal to (in rate and amount) the tax imposed upon articles manufactured in Puerto Rico. Like Section 3 of the Federal Relations Act, this provision prevents discriminatory taxation in favor of merchandise produced in Puerto Rico. <i>Cf.</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7652(a)(1) (subjecting articles of Puerto Rican manufacture entering the mainland United States to \"a tax equal to the internal revenue tax imposed in the United States upon the like articles of domestic manufacture\"). It is not a blanket authorization for Puerto Rico to regulate the delivery of goods. Indeed, Puerto Rico allows the unrestricted delivery of taxable merchandise through the U.S. mail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary also looks to the FAA Authorization Act's legislative history for support for his position, in particular a statement that \"nothing in this amendment is intended to change the application of State tax laws to motor carriers.\" H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-677 at 85 (1994), <i>reprinted in</i> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1676, 1757. Even if we were bound by this fragment of the legislative history, the Secretary's interpretation of it is not consistent with its plain language, or with the overall purpose of the legislation. The taxes at issue in the case before us are generally applicable excise taxes, not taxes on motor carriers. Moreover, the regulatory authority retained by the states was not \"to be used as a guise for continued economic regulation as it relates to prices, routes or services.\" H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-677 at 84 (1994), <i>reprinted in</i> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1676, 1756.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Secretary contends that the challenged scheme survives under the Federal Anti-Head Tax Act, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 40116(e) (formerly 49 U.S.C. &#167; 1513(b)), a provision that he characterizes as a \"savings clause.\" This statute prohibits the states from imposing a tax or \"head charge\" on air transportation, including taxes on air passengers and gross receipts from air transportation. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 40116(b). The provision on which the Secretary relies, &#167; 40116(e), preserves the right of the states to collect those taxes not otherwise barred by the statute. Far from a clear manifestation of congressional intent to permit Puerto Rico's ban on delivery, this broad provision merely preserves certain rights of taxation already held by the states. It creates no new rights for Puerto Rico, and adds nothing to the analysis where, as here, the right of Puerto Rico to levy and collect the excise tax is undisputed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Scope of the Injunction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond the issue of whether injunctive relief is proper in this case &#8212; a question we answer in the affirmative &#8212; lies the issue of whether the particular relief granted was appropriate. A district court has broad discretion to fashion an appropriate equitable remedy, but the relief imposed should be \"no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.\" <i>Califano v. Yamasaki,</i> 442 U.S. 682, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979); <i>Tamko Roofing Products, Inc. v. Ideal Roofing Co., Ltd.,</i> 282 F.3d 23, 40 (1st Cir.2002). Both the Secretary and UPS (in its cross-appeal) challenge the scope of the injunction, alleging that it goes too far or not far enough depending on the point of view.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While several of the parties' submissions touched on matters relevant to the remedy question, the scope issues discussed below were not fully briefed by the parties in anticipation of the injunction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> In view of the public policy implications of this case, we conclude that the parties should be afforded an additional opportunity to present the court with their positions as to the nature and scope of the remedy. We therefore affirm in principle part but remand on three selected issues for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issues to be addressed on remand should be limited to those pertaining to the scope of the district court's injunction that the parties have briefed and argued on appeal. Of these, the one that seems closest is whether the court is now empowered to, and should, invalidate the $14.24 million administrative fine imposed by the Secretary during the course of this litigation. As previously noted, the court enjoined the Secretary from enforcing the fine because it thought the sanction had been imposed pursuant to the preempted legal regime. On appeal, the Secretary says that the court did not appreciate that the fine was imposed under the short-lived Act No. 322 (and not the preempted regime), and that, because UPS has not yet exhausted its state remedies with respect to the fine, the court should have abstained under <i>Younger v. Harris,</i> 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), and related comity-based doctrines. UPS responds that the fine was indeed imposed (for retaliatory reasons) pursuant to the preempted regime, and that the Secretary's other arguments are therefore beside the point. Because a substantial amount of money is at stake and more comprehensive briefing and record development may be helpful, prudence dictates that the district court be afforded an opportunity to revisit the matter after hearing from the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second issue open to revisiting on remand is whether the statutory savings clauses that allow states to regulate motor vehicle safety and the transportation of household goods, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 41713(b)(4)(B)(i)-(ii), should limit the scope of the injunction. It is not clear that the Secretary presented any argument below on the basis of these clauses and, to the extent they are relied upon as grounds for a claim that no injunction should issue, the claim is forfeited. <i>See Higgins,</i> 194 F.3d at 259. This would not necessarily be true so far as the clauses are relied upon for purposes of arguing for a narrower injunction; but we are at a loss to understand how either clause might curtail the relief sought by UPS, and the Secretary's brief is not very enlightening on this point. If the Secretary has some serious argument as to how the injunction needs minor modifications on account of these clauses, we do not foreclose him from presenting such an argument on remand. But it is not yet apparent that the Secretary has such an argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court originally described as preempted and then reinstated 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 9059, which imposes a licensing fee of $2000 per year on air carriers. UPS has cross-appealed, citing authorities suggesting that other courts have found similar licensing fees to be preempted by the FAA Authorization Act. The issue is not directly addressed by the district court and, in view of the remand on other issues, we think it would be useful to have the district court's explanation of its position clarified before the matter is reviewed. We thus leave the district court free in the first instance to affirm or modify the injunction, with respect to &#167; 9059, as it finds appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we <i>affirm</i> the district court's amended judgment but <i>remand</i> as to the three issues identified above, as to which our affirmance is provisional, and we retain jurisdiction for any further appellate proceedings that may be required. <i>Central Maine Power Co. v. FERC,</i> 252 F.3d 34, 48 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court is directed to address and resolve the three remaining issues within 120 days of the date of this decision and is at liberty to modify the injunction as may be required by the resolution of those issues, any such resolution being reviewable by a timely filed new appeal or appeals in accordance with usual practice.

Plaintiffs United Parcel Service, Inc., and United Parcel Service, Co., (collectively \"UPS\") persuaded the district court to enjoin the Commonwealth's Treasury Secretary from enforcing these delivery restrictions on the grounds of federal preemption. The parties have filed cross-appeals which raise difficult questions about the lawfulness and proper scope of the injunction in light of arguably conflicting federal statutes that, on the one hand, strip the district court of jurisdiction to entertain suits seeking to restrain the collection of any Puerto Rico tax and authorize the Commonwealth to exercise taxing jurisdiction over packages as soon as they enter the island, and, on the other hand, limit the Commonwealth's ability to regulate an air carrier's service. In the end, we affirm the court's central ruling but remand for reconsideration of several peripheral matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before us, Defendant Juan A. Flores-Galarza, in his official capacity as the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the \"Secretary\"), contends that the district court erred in finding that it had jurisdiction over the controversy, that Puerto Rico's restrictions on delivery were preempted by federal law, and that an administrative fine imposed by the Secretary was invalid and unenforceable. The Secretary also makes an alternative argument that the injunction is overbroad. UPS's cross-appeal challenges the district court's exclusion from the scope of the injunction a statutory provision requiring the payment of license fees by air carriers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs are corporate affiliates with common controlling ownership engaged in the delivery of packages worldwide. United Parcel Service Co. is authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration to operate as an air carrier for the transportation of property, and United Parcel Service, Inc. is engaged in the transportation of property by motor vehicle. UPS offers door-to-door delivery service and the delivery of packages on an express or time-guaranteed basis. In certain circumstances, UPS refunds delivery charges for express packages that have not been timely delivered. UPS ships approximately 10,000 packages per day to Puerto Rico from the continental United States. UPS's delivery operations function as an integrated system, requiring extensive planning and coordination among its operating facilities, ground fleet, and air fleet. Delays and disruptions in operations can affect thousands of packages in transit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico imposes an excise tax<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> on \"articles of use and consumption,\" including those introduced from elsewhere. 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 9005. The general tax rate is 5 percent of the taxable price, although the rate varies depending on the article, and there are numerous exemptions. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 9015, 9031. No interstate carrier transporting a package subject to an excise levied by the Commonwealth may deliver the package to its intended recipient unless the recipient (the \"consignee\") presents a certificate from the Department of the Treasury evidencing payment of the requisite tax. 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 9066 (\"&#167; 9066\"). If a carrier delivers a package without obtaining this certificate, the carrier may be required to pay an administrative fine to the Secretary, a tax on the package's contents, and any surcharges and interest accrued from the date the items were introduced into Puerto Rico. <i>See id.; see also</i> 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 8080(a), 8140(6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an alternative to the certificate system established by &#167; 9066, carriers such as UPS may prepay the taxes owed, deliver the packages, and seek reimbursement from the packages' consignees. 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 9077; Article 6.005 of Regulations for the Administration and Enforcement of the Excise Tax of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the \"Articles\"). To take advantage of this alternative, carriers must comply with a complex statutory and regulatory scheme resembling the federal customs system. Carriers must provide the Department of the Treasury, on a daily basis, a commercial invoice for each package that describes the package's contents and their cost, as well as a \"shipment manifest\" that lists packages by specific categories. <i>See</i> 1994 Procedure for Freight Air and Ocean Forwarders Who Are Authorized for the Secretary of the Treasury to Pay Taxes and Take Credit for Articles Returned or Paid In Excess or Improperly (\"1994 Procedure\") &#182;&#182; 1-4, 8, 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, carriers who prepay taxes must make packages available for inspection by Treasury agents, and give the agents access to their facilities to supervise the processing of packages. <i>See</i> 1994 Procedure &#182; 10. Carriers must create, maintain, and make available for inspection extensive records relating to the prepayment of fees. <i>See</i> 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 8102, 8140(1); Articles 5.005(7),(11), 6.005. Puerto Rico also requires prepaying carriers to post a bond in excess of the amount required of all carriers under general licensing provisions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 9077. Finally, carriers must calculate and pay the taxes owed by the consignees. 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 9077; Article 6.005.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike commercial carriers, the United States Postal Service may deliver packages to destinations in Puerto Rico without obtaining certificates from recipients or complying with the prepayment scheme. Recipients of packages subject to the excise tax must pay the tax directly to the Department of the Treasury within two business days of receiving a package through the U.S. mail. 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 9068(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As described in greater detail in the opinion of the district court, <i>United Parcel Service, Inc., v. Flores-Galarza,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2579552\"><a href=\"/opinion/2579552/united-parcel-service-inc-v-flores-galarza/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 38-40 (D.P.R.2002), UPS has been required to alter significantly the business practices it employs for the rest of the United States to comply with the Commonwealth's prepayment scheme.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> UPS must, among other things, collect and process comprehensive data on the contents of packages,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> perform tax ratings on these contents, and delay the delivery of packages until all necessary data have been obtained, or until Treasury agents have had an opportunity to inspect the packages on site. UPS also bears the burden of seeking reimbursement from consignees, pays additional amounts if agents alter assessments on packages after they have been delivered, and maintains a $1.5 million bond. UPS incurs more than $4.6 million per year in costs associated with its compliance with the prepayment scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, Congress passed the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act (the \"FAA Authorization Act\"), which provided, in relevant part, that no state (defined to include the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) may \"enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of a law related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier ... when such carrier is transporting property by aircraft or by motor vehicle.\" 49 U.S.C. &#167; 41713(b)(4)(A). This legislation recodified a preemption provision of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-504, &#167; 105, 92 Stat. 1708.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1997, the Senate of Puerto Rico passed a resolution directing various Senate committees to investigate the FAA Authorization Act's impact on existing statutes and regulations of Puerto Rico affecting carriers' prices, routes and services. It did so after reaching the preliminary conclusion that the existing scheme might be in conflict with federal law. <i>See</i> S. Res. 917, 13th Leg. Assem., 2d Ord. Sess. (P.R.1997). Two years later, the Puerto Rico legislature confirmed this conclusion, finding that numerous laws and regulations, including those of the local excise tax system, were impacting or affecting the prices, routes and services of air carriers and affiliated motor carriers. <i>See</i> Act No. 322, 13th Leg. Assem., 6th Ord. Sess. (P.R.1999) (\"Act 322\"). In November 1999, the legislature passed Act 322, which would allow air carriers to transport packages to consignees without restriction, and require consignees to pay the excise tax within two business days. <i>Id.</i> Under Act 322, air carriers would provide the Secretary with \"the minimum information agreed as necessary in order for the Secretary to proceed to collect the excise taxes, without unreasonably interfering in the ordinary course of business in interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> This new legislation also exempted air carriers from licensing requirements. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provisions of Act 322 removing impediments to the delivery of packages would not become effective until June 30, 2001. The legislature concluded that the intervening period would be sufficient for the Department of the Treasury to develop and implement an alternative system consistent with federal law. <i>See id.</i> In the interim, Act 322 provided immediate relief for air carriers by authorizing them to withhold five percent of the taxes they prepaid to the Secretary to defray the costs associated with the existing system. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Act 322's provisions allowing unrestricted delivery were effective for only two business days before the statute was repealed. In July 2001, the Puerto Rico legislature reinstated the &#167; 9066 conditional ban on delivery, as well as the prepayment alternative. During the two business days that Act 322 was effective, UPS delivered packages without collecting excise taxes. UPS provided the Secretary with commercial invoices for each package delivered during those days, which included some, but not all, of the information previously required to be included in daily \"shipment manifests.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day that Act 322 was repealed, July 3, 2001, UPS brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico to enjoin the enforcement of those statutes and regulations affecting its delivery of packages. In its complaint, UPS alleged that Puerto Rico's restrictions on delivery were preempted by the FAA Authorization Act and therefore violated the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> UPS also alleged that the scheme violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &#167; 8, cl.3; Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, cl. 1.; and Takings Clause, U.S. Const. amend. V.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the weeks immediately following the filing of the complaint, the Secretary directed UPS to turn over shipping manifests for the two-day period in July 2001 when Act 322 was in effect. UPS agreed to do so, but only on the condition that the information would not be used in connection with the pending litigation. The Secretary rejected this offer. On November 26, 2001, the Secretary issued an administrative fine against UPS of $14.24 million, citing UPS's failure to provide certain information allegedly \"agreed upon\" at a meeting of the parties on June 29, 2001. This amount represented a $1000 fine for each package delivered, based on the Secretary's estimate that approximately 7120 packages were processed each day. UPS made a timely request for reconsideration and an administrative hearing, reserving its right to contest the validity of the fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to pursuing its administrative remedies, UPS requested that the district court grant a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to prevent the Secretary from enforcing the challenged scheme or the administrative fine. In December 2001, the district court denied this request, concluding that UPS failed to demonstrate that it would suffer irreparable harm if forced to seek relief at the administrative level or that bypassing the administrative process was justified under the circumstances. In reaching its decision, the district court found that the fine arose from a dispute over the information that the parties \"purportedly agreed\" would be provided to the Secretary. UPS appealed the district court's decision to this Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By March 2002, the Secretary had not responded to a motion for summary judgment filed by UPS in August 2001, prior to the emergence of the administrative fine controversy. The district court ordered the Secretary to file an opposition by March 21, 2002.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The Secretary opposed UPS's motion for summary judgment on April 8, 2002, but failed to submit any statement of contested material facts as required by Local Rule 311.12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2002, the district court issued a series of opinions and orders that, collectively, granted summary judgment in favor of UPS and held that the FAA Authorization Act preempted Puerto Rico's statutory and regulatory scheme affecting the delivery of packages. The district court permanently enjoined the enforcement of all statutory and regulatory provisions challenged by UPS except 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 9059, a licensing requirement referenced in UPS's summary judgment papers but not expressly included within UPS's request for relief. The district court also invalidated the $14.24 million administrative fine imposed by the Secretary on the ground that it was imposed pursuant to the preempted scheme. The district court based its decision on the papers filed by the parties, and did not convene a hearing before imposing the injunction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary appealed, and UPS cross-appealed solely to the extent the district court excluded the licensing provision, &#167; 9059, from the scope of the permanent injunction. UPS also obtained a voluntary dismissal of its appeal to this Court on the issue of enforcement of the administrative fine. <i>See</i> note 6, above. In July 2002, at the request of the Secretary, this Court granted a stay of the permanent injunction pending resolution of the appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We replay a familiar refrain. Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>Rochester Ford Sales, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199925\"><a href=\"/opinion/199925/rochester-ford-sales-v-ford-motor-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.2002). We review <i>de novo</i> the district court's grant of summary judgment. <i>See id.</i> In so doing, we construe the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, resolving all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. <i>See id.</i> Here, however, the district court, acting within its discretion to manage its cases, accepted the uncontested facts submitted by UPS because of the Secretary's failure to comply with Local Rule 311.12 in its opposition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> <i>See A.M. Capen's Co., Inc. v. American Trading and Prod., Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198810\"><a href=\"/opinion/198810/capens-v-american/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span>, (1st Cir.2000). Because we confine our review to the record at the time the district court made its ruling on the motion for summary judgment, the facts set forth in UPS's motion for summary judgment are not in dispute. <i>See id.</i> Those facts not included in UPS's statement, specifically those facts relating to the administrative fine imposed after UPS sought summary judgment, are considered in the light most favorable to the Secretary. <i>See Rochester Ford,</i> 287 F.3d at 38. We review the district court's grant of injunctive relief \"in so far as it involves no question of law\" for abuse of discretion. <i>Conservation Law Found., Inc. v. Busey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715637\"><a href=\"/opinion/715637/conservation-law-foundation-inc-v-james-busey-administrator-federal/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1250</span></a></span>, 1256 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Federal Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold issue, the Secretary contends that a provision of the Butler Act, codified at 48 U.S.C. &#167; 872,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> deprived the district court of jurisdiction over the action filed by UPS. Under the Butler Act, \"[n]o suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of a tax imposed by the laws of Puerto Rico shall be maintained in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.\" 48 U.S.C. &#167; 872. For the reasons that follow, the prohibition does not apply to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary contends that UPS has challenged the statutory and regulatory mechanism for collecting the excise tax, thus UPS seeks to restrain the assessment or collection of the tax within the meaning of the Butler Act. But the action initiated by UPS sought to enjoin only those provisions of the laws and regulations of Puerto Rico that prohibit or interfere with the delivery of packages. UPS did not challenge the amount or validity of the excise tax, nor the authority of the Secretary to assess or collect it. The relief sought by UPS leaves the Secretary free to collect the tax from those who owe it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not every statutory or regulatory obligation that may aid the Secretary's ability to collect a tax is immune from attack in federal court by virtue of the Butler Act's jurisdictional bar. <i>See Wells v. Malloy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"324821\"><a href=\"/opinion/324821/jerome-j-wells-v-james-e-malloy-commissioner-of-motor-vehicles-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 76-77 (2d Cir.1975)(Friendly, J.)(action questioning the constitutionality of a statute providing for suspension of a driver's license for failure to pay motor vehicle taxes did not constitute an attempt to restrain the assessment or levy of the tax); <i>see also Mobil Oil Corp. v.

Such an interpretation extends the concept of tax collection, and therefore the breadth of the Butler Act, too far. <i>See Wells,</i> 510 F.2d at 77 (rejecting as overbroad an interpretation of tax collection that would include \"anything that a state has determined to be a likely method of securing payment\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the Tax Injunction Act, the Butler Act's jurisdictional bar extends to</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">cases where taxpayers were repeatedly using the federal courts to raise questions of state or federal law going to the validity of the particular taxes imposed upon them &#8212; not to a case where a taxpayer contended that an unusual sanction for non-payment of a tax admittedly due violated his constitutional rights, an issue which, once determined, would be determined for him and all others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (notation omitted). Admittedly, the conditional ban on package deliveries may not seem to be in some respects as unusual as the drivers' license penalty in <i>Wells.</i> Nevertheless, because the delivery ban targets third parties instead of those who owe the tax, this is not a prototypical Tax Injunction Act or Butler Act case. UPS does not seek to restrain a system that \"produce[s] money or other property directly.\" <i>Id.</i> Instead, by exposing commercial carriers to fines and penalties (including the loss of their license to do business in Puerto Rico) if they choose to deliver a package without collecting a certificate from the recipient, &#167; 9066 produces tax money \"indirectly through a more general use of coercive power,\" <i>id.,</i> using the threat of sanctions against private parties who do not even owe the taxes at issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> This is not a system of tax collection within the meaning of the Butler Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that commercial carriers have the option &#8212; a perhaps generous characterization &#8212; to participate in the alternative prepayment system does not alter the equation. The prepayment alternative would have no teeth independent of the &#167; 9066 ban on service. It may thus be the case that, for all practical purposes, commercial carriers have been conscripted into making payments on behalf of taxpayers, thereby promoting the Secretary's revenue raising efficiency as a condition of doing business. But we should not deny a federal forum to a party challenging the constitutionality of this system on the ground that an adverse ruling could make the Secretary's job harder.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Preemption under the FAA Authorization Act</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Urging that Puerto Rico's restrictions on delivery are not preempted by the FAA Authorization Act, the Secretary advances two principal arguments. First, the Secretary notes that Puerto Rico has a special taxing power under Section 3 of the Federal Relations Act, 48 U.S.C. &#167; 741a. According to the Secretary, the FAA Authorization Act cannot be read to limit this unique taxing authority by preempting statutes and regulations that merely implement it. Second, the Secretary contends that Congress did not intend to preempt the challenged statutes and regulations, which either fall outside the scope of the FAA Authorization Act's preemptive effect or are preserved under other provisions of federal law. Although ably pressed, both of these arguments ultimately come up short.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Role of the Federal Relations Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3 of the Federal Relations Act provides in part that any excise tax imposed by Puerto Rico \"may be levied and collected ... as soon as the [taxable items] are manufactured, sold, used, or brought into the island.\" 48 U.S.C. &#167; 741a. The Secretary says that the parcel delivery requirements merely implement Puerto Rico's taxing authority under the Federal Relations Act. So, he argues, \"this case does not involve a state statute that is subject to preemption by a federal statute,\" but instead involves only the interface between two federal statutes, the FAA Authorization Act and the Federal Relations Act. The case would thus turn on whether the FAA Authorization Act impliedly repealed the Federal Relations Act.

In practice, Puerto Rico has wielded a unique power as a result of the Federal Relations Act. In the years following the 1927 amendment, Puerto Rico succeeded in imposing a state tax on oil imported into bonded warehouses where New York failed &#8212; the critical distinction between the two taxes being the specific taxing authority of Puerto Rico under the Federal Relations Act. <i>Compare West India Oil Co. v.

Congress intended that the 1927 amendment to the Federal Relations Act resolve existing controversy over whether taxes could be imposed on goods still in their original packaging.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> <i>See</i> H.R.Rep.

We are left with two different federal statutes (the Federal Relations Act and the FAA Authorization Act), neither of which specifically address the issues raised in this case. As to these issues, therefore, neither statute has any automatic priority over the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the Federal Relations Act and the FAA Authorization Act can co-exist harmoniously. Our analysis proceeds down a well worn path: where two federal statutes are alleged to be in conflict, we look to whether they touch upon the same subject, and if so, whether we can give effect to both statutes. <i>See Rhode Island v. Narragansett Indian Tribe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195256\"><a href=\"/opinion/195256/state-of-ri-v-narragansett-tribe/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span>, 703 (1st Cir.1994). We are further guided by the familiar principle of construction that implied repeals are disfavored. <i>Id.</i> Here, the statutes at issue address two very different subjects: Puerto Rico's taxing authority on the one hand and deregulation of the air transportation industry on the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Federal Relations Act does not suggest that Puerto Rico is empowered to impose restrictions on the <i>delivery</i> of packages by private carriers. The legislative history describing the purpose of the 1927 amendment includes the observation that Congress expected that the government of Puerto Rico would \"make use of this power so as not to unnecessarily place any barriers in the way of the free-trade conditions now existing\" between Puerto Rico and the mainland United States, \"which is [a] principal factor in the progress and prosperity of P[ue]rto Rico.\" H.R.Rep. No. 1370, at 2 (1926); S.Rep. No. 1011, at 2 (1926). We do not interpret the statute as conferring a broad authority to regulate the flow of packages in interstate commerce that conflicts with the FAA Authorization Act. To do so would be to manufacture a statutory conflict where none exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a practical matter, it is not the case that the Secretary's exercise of his taxing authority necessitates the regulation of packages entering Puerto Rico. Packages arriving by U.S. mail are delivered without interference, and recipients are required to pay any applicable tax within 48 hours. <i>See</i> 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 9068. The Secretary has introduced no evidence suggesting why this approach (or some other legislatively established process) would not be suitable for packages arriving by air carrier. Nor has he put forth a rational explanation for treating these two forms of delivery so differently.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Legislative Intent to Preempt</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's second major argument is that Congress did not intend to preempt the challenged scheme, which either falls outside the scope of the preemption clause of the FAA Authorization Act, or is preserved under other provisions of federal law. So, the reasoning goes, the district court construed too broadly the scope of the FAA Authorization Act's express preemption provision, which provides that no state may</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[E]nact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of a law <i>related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier</i> ... when such carrier is transporting property by aircraft or by motor vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">49 U.S.C. &#167; 41713 (emphasis added). In determining the scope of this provision, we look to Congress's intent, which is revealed in the language of the provision, as well as the structure and purpose of the statute. <i>See Morales v.

When used in a preemption provision such as &#167; 41713, it has a similarly broad reach. State laws and regulations \"having a connection with or reference to\" an air carrier's prices, routes or services are preempted under &#167; 41713. <i>See id.</i> at 384, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112742\"><a href=\"/opinion/112742/morales-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This interpretation is consistent with the purpose animating the FAA Authorization Act and Airline Deregulation Act, which sought to prevent states from interfering with the goal of federal deregulation of air transportation by imposing regulations of their own. <i>See id.</i> at 378, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112742\"><a href=\"/opinion/112742/morales-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This narrower interpretation would read the \"related to\" language out of the statute, an approach expressly rejected by the Supreme Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> <i>See id.</i> at 385, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112742\"><a href=\"/opinion/112742/morales-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Section 9066 &#8212; the linchpin of the scheme &#8212; <i>forbids delivery</i> unless and until a recipient produces a certificate from the Secretary. Compliance with this provision significantly affects the timeliness and effectiveness of UPS's service, which includes the delivery of packages on an express or time-guaranteed basis. Likewise, the prepayment mechanism imposes extensive requirements that must be met before a carrier may make a lawful delivery. These requirements create a substantial burden on UPS, in the form of additional labor, costs, and delays. The undisputed record, as chronicled by the district court below, shows that this burden directly and significantly affects UPS's routes and services, which depend upon an orderly flow of packages. <i>United Parcel Service,</i> 210 F.Supp.2d at 38-40. The costs of this scheme necessarily have a negative effect on UPS's prices. <i>See Federal Express Corp. v. California Pub. Util.

In view of the uncontroverted record, we must conclude that the challenged scheme falls within the scope of the FAA Authorization Act's preemption provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against the weight of this authority, the Secretary argues for a presumption against preemption. This presumption only arises, however, if Congress legislates in a field traditionally occupied by the states. <i>United States v.

Instead, he says that the relevant field is \"state taxation.\" We think our earlier analysis of the Butler Act puts to rest the question of whether our task is to determine the validity of a Commonwealth tax. On the contrary, our task is to determine the preemptive effect of the FAA Authorization Act within the field of air transportation. No presumption against preemption is appropriate in this case because of Congress's significant &#8212; and undisputed &#8212; presence in the field of air transportation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of the \"specific substantive pre-emption provision\" of the FAA Authorization Act, <i>Morales,</i> 504 U.S. at 385, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112742\"><a href=\"/opinion/112742/morales-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2031</span></a></span>, the Secretary also asks us to conclude that the challenged scheme survives by virtue of other provisions of federal law or the FAA Authorization Act's legislative history. First, he points to 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7653, a provision of the Internal Revenue Code that subjects articles manufactured in the mainland United States to a tax at the port of entry in Puerto Rico that is equal to (in rate and amount) the tax imposed upon articles manufactured in Puerto Rico. Like Section 3 of the Federal Relations Act, this provision prevents discriminatory taxation in favor of merchandise produced in Puerto Rico. <i>Cf.</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7652(a)(1) (subjecting articles of Puerto Rican manufacture entering the mainland United States to \"a tax equal to the internal revenue tax imposed in the United States upon the like articles of domestic manufacture\"). It is not a blanket authorization for Puerto Rico to regulate the delivery of goods. Indeed, Puerto Rico allows the unrestricted delivery of taxable merchandise through the U.S. mail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary also looks to the FAA Authorization Act's legislative history for support for his position, in particular a statement that \"nothing in this amendment is intended to change the application of State tax laws to motor carriers.\" H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-677 at 85 (1994), <i>reprinted in</i> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1676, 1757. Even if we were bound by this fragment of the legislative history, the Secretary's interpretation of it is not consistent with its plain language, or with the overall purpose of the legislation. The taxes at issue in the case before us are generally applicable excise taxes, not taxes on motor carriers. Moreover, the regulatory authority retained by the states was not \"to be used as a guise for continued economic regulation as it relates to prices, routes or services.\" H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-677 at 84 (1994), <i>reprinted in</i> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1676, 1756.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Secretary contends that the challenged scheme survives under the Federal Anti-Head Tax Act, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 40116(e) (formerly 49 U.S.C. &#167; 1513(b)), a provision that he characterizes as a \"savings clause.\" This statute prohibits the states from imposing a tax or \"head charge\" on air transportation, including taxes on air passengers and gross receipts from air transportation. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 40116(b). The provision on which the Secretary relies, &#167; 40116(e), preserves the right of the states to collect those taxes not otherwise barred by the statute. Far from a clear manifestation of congressional intent to permit Puerto Rico's ban on delivery, this broad provision merely preserves certain rights of taxation already held by the states. It creates no new rights for Puerto Rico, and adds nothing to the analysis where, as here, the right of Puerto Rico to levy and collect the excise tax is undisputed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

Of these, the one that seems closest is whether the court is now empowered to, and should, invalidate the $14.24 million administrative fine imposed by the Secretary during the course of this litigation. As previously noted, the court enjoined the Secretary from enforcing the fine because it thought the sanction had been imposed pursuant to the preempted legal regime. On appeal, the Secretary says that the court did not appreciate that the fine was imposed under the short-lived Act No. 322 (and not the preempted regime), and that, because UPS has not yet exhausted its state remedies with respect to the fine, the court should have abstained under <i>Younger v.

UPS responds that the fine was indeed imposed (for retaliatory reasons) pursuant to the preempted regime, and that the Secretary's other arguments are therefore beside the point. Because a substantial amount of money is at stake and more comprehensive briefing and record development may be helpful, prudence dictates that the district court be afforded an opportunity to revisit the matter after hearing from the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second issue open to revisiting on remand is whether the statutory savings clauses that allow states to regulate motor vehicle safety and the transportation of household goods, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 41713(b)(4)(B)(i)-(ii), should limit the scope of the injunction. It is not clear that the Secretary presented any argument below on the basis of these clauses and, to the extent they are relied upon as grounds for a claim that no injunction should issue, the claim is forfeited. <i>See Higgins,</i> 194 F.3d at 259. This would not necessarily be true so far as the clauses are relied upon for purposes of arguing for a narrower injunction; but we are at a loss to understand how either clause might curtail the relief sought by UPS, and the Secretary's brief is not very enlightening on this point. If the Secretary has some serious argument as to how the injunction needs minor modifications on account of these clauses, we do not foreclose him from presenting such an argument on remand. But it is not yet apparent that the Secretary has such an argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court originally described as preempted and then reinstated 13 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 9059, which imposes a licensing fee of $2000 per year on air carriers.
