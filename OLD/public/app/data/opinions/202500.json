Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n           [Hon. Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                  Siler,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Paul G. Levenson, Assistant United States Attorney with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney and Adam J. Bookbinder,\nwere on brief, for United States.\n     Raymond E. Gillespie for defendant.\n\n\n                           November 15, 2006\n\n\n\n\n     *Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f          HOWARD, Circuit Judge. The Sixth Amendment to the United\n\nStates Constitution provides that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions,\n\nthe accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of\n\nCounsel for his defence.\"      This right \"is the right to the\n\neffective assistance of counsel.\"     McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S.\n\n759, 771 n.14 (1970). A defendant seeking to overturn a conviction\n\non ineffective assistance of counsel grounds usually must show that\n\ncounsel's representation was deficient and that this deficient\n\nperformance prejudiced the defense.    See Strickland v. Washington,\n\n466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).   There are, however, situations in which\n\nprejudice is presumed, including where \"counsel entirely fails to\n\nsubject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing.\"\n\nUnited States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 659 (1984).\n\n          In this case, the district court allowed Thomas Ronald\n\nTheodore's motion for a new trial, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 33,\n\nconcluding that defense counsel had performed so poorly that\n\nprejudice should be presumed under Cronic.     See United States v.\n\nTheodore, 345 F. Supp. 2d 123 (D. Mass. 2004).       The government\n\nappeals, arguing that the court erred in presuming prejudice.1\n\n          In 2000, a grand jury indicted Theodore on nine counts of\n\nmail fraud, 19 U.S.C. § 341, and three counts of violating the\n\n\n\n     1\n      Theodore filed a notice of cross-appeal (No. 05-1120), which\nthe government moved to dismiss on the ground that Theodore's brief\ndid not include any argument supporting a cross-appeal. We allow\nthe government's motion.\n\n                                -2-\n\fFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 331(a), (d), & (p).           The\n\nindictment alleged that from 1992 until 1995, Theodore and a\n\nbusiness partner solicited over $1.5 million in investments by\n\nclaiming that Theodore had invented a promising new anti-cancer\n\ndrug called \"LK-200.\"        Investors were told that the drug was\n\nmanufactured by means of a secret process at overseas facilities\n\nbecause it had not been approved for domestic production. In fact,\n\nthere was nothing secret about \"LK-200,\" which is a well-known\n\nbiological substance that is produced domestically.          Over the life\n\nof the scam, Theodore made misstatements to investors about himself\n\nand the product, including representations that he was a medical\n\ndoctor.   Theodore also directed the manufacture of \"LK-200\" in\n\nunsanitary conditions that made it unsafe for use.\n\n          Following    the     indictment,     Theodore     initially    was\n\nrepresented by Attorney John Bostinalli, but Bostinalli quickly\n\nwithdrew from the case.      Theodore then was represented by Attorney\n\nGordon White, a Texas attorney who appeared pro hac vice, with\n\nMassachusetts   Attorney     John   Noonan   serving   as   local   counsel.\n\nDuring the period that White and Noonan represented Theodore, White\n\nwas lead counsel.     However, while White never formally withdrew\n\nfrom the case, he last appeared for Theodore at a motion hearing in\n\nOctober 2000.\n\n          On February 1, 2001, Noonan represented Theodore at a\n\npretrial conference.       At this hearing, it became apparent that\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fWhite no longer represented Theodore and that Noonan was the sole\n\ndefense counsel.    Noonan had been a lawyer for over forty years,\n\nbut had never tried a federal court case.    The district court asked\n\nNoonan if he felt comfortable representing Theodore.            Noonan\n\nresponded that he was afraid that his continuing participation\n\ncould create a Sixth Amendment issue because he was not competent\n\nto try the case.\n\n           The next day, Noonan formally moved to withdraw and have\n\nnew counsel appointed.      The government responded that Noonan had\n\nbeen involved in the case from the early stages and that he seemed\n\nfamiliar with the issues.       The district court denied Noonan's\n\nmotion and instead appointed standby counsel to advise Noonan about\n\nfederal procedure.     At this point, Theodore objected to having\n\nNoonan represent him.       The court overruled the objection and\n\nordered that trial commence ten days later, with Noonan serving as\n\nsole defense counsel.       After a fifteen-day trial, Theodore was\n\nconvicted on all counts of the indictment.\n\n           The district court appointed new counsel to represent\n\nTheodore at sentencing and in connection with any post-trial\n\nmotions he wished to file.      Theodore subsequently filed a motion\n\nfor a new trial, asserting ineffective assistance of counsel.         The\n\ndistrict   court   denied   Theodore's   motion   without   holding    an\n\nevidentiary hearing.     Applying Strickland, the court ruled that,\n\neven if Noonan's performance was deficient, the government's case\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fwas so overwhelming that Theodore could not possibly establish\n\nprejudice.\n\n            Theodore appealed.     See United States v. Theodore, 354\n\nF.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2003).    We upheld part of the appeal and remanded,\n\nconcluding that the district court \"abused its discretion by not\n\nholding an evidentiary hearing to resolve or clarify factual issues\n\nultimately crucial to Theodore's claim of ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel.\"    Id.   at 8.\n\n            On remand, the district judge who had presided over the\n\ntrial and denied the new trial motion recused himself.            A new\n\ndistrict judge held the required evidentiary hearing.          Following\n\nthe conclusion of this hearing, the district court made detailed\n\nfindings concerning Noonan's performance, which we now summarize.\n\nSee Theodore, 345 F. Supp. 2d at 126-28.\n\n            Noonan's   pretrial   investigation   was   incomplete.   He\n\nreviewed boxes of documents at the United States Attorney's office\n\nand identified certain documents that he thought were relevant.\n\nBut he never opened several CD ROMS that the government had\n\nprovided which contained all the documents that were available to\n\nNoonan at the United States Attorney's office.          Moreover, Noonan\n\ndid not attempt to interview any witness other than Theodore.\n\n            At the time of the trial, Noonan did not have an office\n\nor support staff, and he in his own words planned \"to play it by\n\near and shoot from the hip.\"      Noonan began his opening statement by\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fstating that, \"I am rapidly approaching seventy.                         I have been\n\nretired for five years.         I was never supposed to try this case.\"\n\nThe court struck these comments as inappropriate.\n\n              During cross examination of the government's witnesses,\n\nNoonan repeatedly asked open-ended questions. He was criticized by\n\nthe court for being redundant and for having witnesses read from\n\ndocuments      already     admitted    into    evidence.          At    times,     Noonan\n\nappeared unfamiliar with the rules of evidence, struggled to lay\n\nproper       evidentiary    foundations,       and    had    difficulty          hearing\n\nobjections.        His     closing    argument    was    interrupted          by    eight\n\nobjections, all of which were sustained.\n\n              Noonan was also unfamiliar with the federal subpoena\n\nprocess and ultimately subpoenaed only one witness.                       The witness\n\nfiled    a    motion   to    quash    claiming    that      he    had    no   relevant\n\ninformation. The trial judge held an impromptu hearing on March 2,\n\n2001, to deal with the motion, but Noonan was unaware that the\n\nhearing had been scheduled and did not attend.                   At the hearing, the\n\ncourt concluded that the witness \"had nothing relevant to say\" and\n\nallowed the motion to quash \"subject to reconsideration.\"                          Noonan\n\nnever sought reconsideration.\n\n              On the basis of this factual predicate, the district\n\ncourt concluded that Theodore was entitled to a new trial.                            The\n\ncourt first ruled that \"Noonan's representation of Theodore clearly\n\nfell    below    an    objective      standard   of     reasonableness,            easily\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fsatisfying the first part of the Strickland analysis.\" Id. at 129.\n\nThe court then further concluded that prejudice should be presumed\n\nin these circumstances because the government's case had \"never\n\nbeen subjected to the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.\"\n\nId. (citation omitted).     According to the court, \"the lack of\n\nmeaningful adversarial testing began with inadequate preparation\n\nand continued throughout every stage of Theodore's trial.\"           Id. at\n\n130.\n\n          The government appeals.         Acknowledging that \"the overall\n\nimpression left by [Noonan's] defense was abysmal,\" the government\n\ndoes not contest that Theodore satisfied the performance aspect of\n\nhis ineffective assistance of counsel claim.               The government\n\ncontends, however, that the district court erroneously concluded\n\nthat Noonan's performance was so egregious that prejudice should be\n\npresumed under Cronic.    In the government's view, because Noonan\n\ndid subject the prosecutor's case to some adversarial testing,\n\nTheodore was required to show actual prejudice under Strickland.\n\n          We ordinarily review the grant or denial of a new trial\n\nmotion for a manifest abuse of discretion.          See United States v.\n\nConley, 249 F.3d 38, 44 (1st Cir. 2001).         Where, however, a party\n\nclaims that the wrong legal standard was applied in adjudicating\n\nthe motion, we review the claim de novo.           See United States v.\n\nJosleyn, 206 F.3d 144, 151 (1st Cir. 2000).            Determining whether\n\nStrickland's   actual   prejudice    standard     or    Cronic's   presumed\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fprejudice standard applies to Theodore's new trial motion is a\n\nmixed question of law and fact subject to de novo review.                 See\n\nScarpa v. Dubois, 38 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1994); see also Haynes v.\n\nCain, 272 F.3d 757, 761 (5th Cir. 2001).\n\n                  As mentioned earlier, a successful ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel claim generally requires the defendant to demonstrate\n\nactual prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability that, but for\n\ncounsel's deficient performance, the result of the trial would have\n\nbeen different.           See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695.       There is an\n\nexception, however, where \"counsel entirely fails to subject the\n\nprosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing.\"2              Cronic,\n\n466 U.S. at 659.          In such cases, prejudice is presumed.     Id.   But\n\nthe Cronic exception is exceedingly narrow, see Florida v. Nixon,\n\n543 U.S. 175, 190 (2004), and applies where the defendant has\n\ndemonstrated that \"the attorney's failure [was] complete,\" Bell v.\n\nCone,       535    U.S.   685,   696-97   (2002).   In   other   words,   \"the\n\ncircumstances leading to counsel's ineffectiveness [must be] so\n\negregious that the defendant was in effect denied any meaningful\n\nassistance at all.\"          United States v. Griffin, 324 F.3d 330, 364\n\n(5th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n        2\n      Prejudice is also presumed where there is the complete denial\nof counsel during a critical stage of the prosecution or\ncircumstances surrounding the trial make it impossible for even\ncompetent counsel to provide effective representation. See Cronic,\n466 U.S. at 659-61.\n\n                                          -8-\n\f            The Cronic exception has been applied in cases where\n\ncounsel    slept   as   evidence   was       being    introduced    against     the\n\ndefendant, Burdine v. Johnson, 262 F.3d 336, 338 (5th Cir. 2001)\n\n(en banc), where counsel adopted and acted upon a belief that his\n\nclient should be convicted, Osborn v. Shillinger, 861 F.2d 612, 625\n\n(10th Cir. 1988), and where counsel sat silently throughout the\n\nentire trial, see Harding v. Davis, 878 F.2d 1341, 1345 (11th Cir.\n\n1989).    But it has been held inapplicable to cases involving \"bad\n\nlawyering,   regardless     of   how    bad.\"        Scarpa,   38   F.3d   at   13\n\n(citation omitted).      \"Attorney error, even when egregious,             . . .\n\nalmost always require[s] analysis under Strickland's prejudice\n\nprong.\"    Id. at 14.\n\n            Bell demonstrates the narrowness of the Cronic exception.\n\nSee 535 U.S. at 696-97.      During the sentencing phase of a capital\n\nmurder trial, defense counsel took three actions on behalf of his\n\nclient: he made a brief opening statement asking for mercy and\n\nreferencing that the defendant suffered Vietnam Veterans Syndrome;\n\nhe established on cross-examination that the defendant had received\n\nthe Bronze Star during his Vietnam service; and he successfully\n\nobjected to the introduction of two photographs of the murder\n\nvictims.   Id. at 708.    But counsel did not interview any witnesses\n\nrelevant to the guilt phase; present mitigation testimony from the\n\ndefendant's relatives who were available to testify; or make a\n\nclosing statement.        Id. at 708-10.             Despite counsel's meager\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fefforts, the Supreme Court determined that the defendant had not\n\ndemonstrated     that    counsel       failed     entirely      to     oppose      the\n\nprosecution; rather, the defendant showed only that counsel failed\n\nto oppose the prosecution \"at specific points\" in the proceeding.\n\nId. at 696-97.       Therefore, the Court held that Cronic's presumed\n\nprejudice standard did not apply.             Id. at 697.\n\n            Noonan's performance resembles the attorney's performance\n\nin Bell.      While Noonan's representation of Theodore suffered\n\nsignificant    shortcomings,         it   was     not       tantamount     to     non-\n\nrepresentation.         Prior   to    trial,     Noonan      reviewed     boxes    of\n\ndocuments, \"looked at every single cotton-picking piece of paper,\"\n\nand asked the government to provide copies of those documents he\n\nthought relevant. Noonan also filed pretrial motions on Theodore's\n\nbehalf, including a non-frivolous motion arguing that a recent\n\nSupreme Court decision required the dismissal of the mail fraud\n\ncharges.    During voir dire, Noonan exercised several peremptory\n\nchallenges.\n\n            Noonan    also   participated       in    the    trial   itself.        He\n\npresented an opening during which he touched on several themes,\n\nincluding   that     Theodore's      conduct    was   beyond     the     statute    of\n\nlimitations; that someone else was responsible for the illegal\n\nconduct; and that \"LK-200\" was not a drug and therefore not subject\n\nto the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act.              He cross-examined all of the\n\ngovernment witnesses, and he occasionally asked questions that\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\freturned to the themes mentioned in the opening.               Noonan also\n\nintroduced nine defense exhibits that related in some degree to the\n\ndefense themes, filed a Fed. R. Crim. P. 29 motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal, and made a closing argument.\n\n          In summarizing Noonan's performance, the district court\n\nrecognized   that    Noonan   had    \"cross-examined     the    government\n\nwitnesses, suggested some defense themes, and introduced a few\n\nexhibits.\"   Theodore, 345 F. Supp. 2d at 126-27.           Such minimal\n\nperformance is sufficient to remove this case from Cronic's ambit.\n\nSee, e.g., Bell, 535 U.S. at 696-97; Barrow v. Uchtman, 398 F.3d\n\n597, 603 n.4 (7th Cir. 2005) (concluding that Cronic did not apply\n\nwhere counsel presented no evidence in defendant's capital case but\n\ndid present an opening or closing argument and conducted some\n\ncross-examinations); Millender v. Adams, 376 F.3d 520, 524 (6th\n\nCir. 2004) (concluding that Cronic did not apply where counsel\n\ncross-examined witnesses, made objections, and presented a closing\n\nargument); Hooper v. Mullin,      314 F.3d 1162, 1175 (10th Cir. 2002)\n\n(concluding that Cronic did not apply where counsel cross-examined\n\nwitnesses,   made   objections,     presented   some   evidence   favoring\n\ndefendant, and made an opening and closing argument); Fink v.\n\nLockhart, 823 F.2d 204, 206 (8th Cir. 1987) (concluding that Cronic\n\ndid not apply where defense counsel used peremptory challenges,\n\ncross-examined witnesses, and made a closing argument).            This is\n\nnot to say that Noonan's performance was acceptable.            Indeed, it\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fundoubtedly       fell   below   the    \"very     forgiving\"      Sixth    Amendment\n\nstandard for effective assistance of counsel.                    Delgado v. Lewis,\n\n223 F.3d 976, 981 (9th Cir. 2000).              But Noonan's conduct was not so\n\ndeficient     that       Theodore      should     have    been     relieved     from\n\ndemonstrating actual prejudice under Strickland.\n\n            Theodore      has    presented      an   alternative     argument    for\n\naffirming the new trial order.           He contends that even if prejudice\n\nwas incorrectly presumed under Cronic, he has demonstrated actual\n\nprejudice under Strickland.            The government disagrees and further\n\ncontends that Theodore forfeited the actual prejudice argument by\n\nfailing to raise it in the district court.\n\n            In the circumstances of this case, we do not find that\n\nTheodore    has    forfeited     his    actual       prejudice    claim.      During\n\nTheodore's opening remarks at the post-trial evidentiary hearing,\n\ncounsel stated that Theodore would present evidence showing that if\n\nNoonan had done a better job \"it would have made a difference.\"\n\nCounsel    also    specifically     distinguished        Theodore's       Strickland\n\nargument from his Cronic argument by telling the court that, at the\n\nconclusion of the hearing, Theodore \"will have met the Strickland\n\ntest [and] will also have met the test to show that Noonan . . .\n\nconstructively abandoned [him].\"                 And, in Theodore's proposed\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, he specifically requested\n\na ruling on actual prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f           It is true that Theodore did not fully develop the actual\n\nprejudice issue before the district court.           But this resulted from\n\nthe manner in which events unfolded and not from any decision to\n\nabandon the actual prejudice argument.             On the first day of the\n\nevidentiary    hearing,     Noonan   and     the    trial   judge   testified\n\nconcerning Noonan's performance. At the start of the second day of\n\nthe hearing, the district court announced that, based on the first\n\nday's testimony, it had decided to order a new trial under Cronic.\n\nThe court offered the government the opportunity to withdraw its\n\nopposition to Theodore's motion, but the government declined, so\n\nthe court permitted the hearing to continue to a conclusion. Given\n\nthe court's statement that it had already decided to allow the new\n\ntrial motion on presumed prejudice grounds, we will not fault\n\nTheodore for declining to make a detailed presentation on actual\n\nprejudice.\n\n           The lack of a complete evidentiary record does, however,\n\nprevent us from accepting Theodore's invitation to resolve the\n\nactual prejudice issue on this appeal.             The issue largely turns\n\non documents that are not properly within the appellate record.\n\nMoreover, the record, as currently constituted, lacks an adequate\n\ndescription of the precise evidence that Theodore would present if\n\na retrial were ordered.       We therefore vacate the new trial order\n\nand   remand   to   the   district   court    to   consider,   upon   further\n\nsubmissions or after hearing, whether Theodore has demonstrated\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\factual prejudice under Strickland.

A defendant seeking to overturn a conviction on ineffective assistance of counsel grounds usually must show that counsel's representation was deficient and that this deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <i>See Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). There are, however, situations in which prejudice is presumed, including where \"counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing.\" <i>United States v.

See United States v. Theodore,</i> 345 F.Supp.2d 123 (D.Mass.2004). The government appeals, arguing that the court erred in presuming prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2000, a grand jury indicted Theodore on nine counts of mail fraud, 19 U.S.C. &#167; 341, and three counts of violating the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 331(a), (d), &amp; (p). The indictment alleged that from 1992 until 1995, Theodore and a business partner solicited over $1.5 million in investments by claiming that Theodore had invented a promising new anti-cancer drug called \"LK-200.\" Investors were told that the drug was manufactured by means of a secret process at overseas facilities because it had not been approved for domestic production. In fact, there was nothing secret about \"LK-200,\" which is a well-known biological substance that is produced domestically. Over the life of the scam, Theodore made misstatements to investors about himself and the product, including representations that he was a medical doctor. Theodore also directed the manufacture of \"LK-200\" in unsanitary conditions that made it unsafe for use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the indictment, Theodore initially was represented by Attorney John Bostinalli, but Bostinalli quickly withdrew from the case. Theodore then was represented by Attorney Gordon White, a Texas attorney who appeared pro hac vice, with Massachusetts Attorney John Noonan serving as local counsel. During the period that White and Noonan represented Theodore, White was lead counsel. However, while White never formally withdrew from the case, he last appeared for Theodore at a motion hearing in October 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 1, 2001, Noonan represented Theodore at a pretrial conference. At this hearing, it became apparent that White no longer represented Theodore and that Noonan was the sole defense counsel. Noonan had been a lawyer for over forty years, but had never tried a federal court case. The district court asked Noonan if he felt comfortable representing Theodore. Noonan responded that he was afraid that his continuing participation could create a Sixth Amendment issue because he was not competent to try the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, Noonan formally moved to withdraw and have new counsel appointed. The government responded that Noonan had been involved in the case from the early stages and that he seemed familiar with the issues. The district court denied Noonan's motion and instead appointed standby counsel to advise Noonan about federal procedure. At this point, Theodore objected to having Noonan represent him. The court overruled the objection and ordered that trial commence ten days later, with Noonan serving as sole defense counsel. After a fifteen-day trial, Theodore was convicted on all counts of the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court appointed new counsel to represent Theodore at sentencing and in connection with any post-trial motions he wished to file. Theodore subsequently filed a motion for a new trial, asserting ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court denied Theodore's motion without holding an evidentiary hearing. Applying <i>Strickland,</i> the court ruled that, even if Noonan's performance was deficient, the government's case was so overwhelming that Theodore could not possibly establish prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Theodore appealed. <i>See United States v. Theodore,</i> 354 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2003). We upheld part of the appeal and remanded, concluding that the district court \"abused its discretion by not holding an evidentiary hearing to resolve or clarify factual issues ultimately crucial to Theodore's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\" <i>Id.</i> at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district judge who had presided over the trial and denied the new trial motion recused himself. A new district judge held the required evidentiary hearing. Following the conclusion of this hearing, the district court made detailed findings concerning Noonan's performance, which we now summarize. <i>See Theodore,</i> 345 F.Supp.2d at 126-28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noonan's pretrial investigation was incomplete. He reviewed boxes of documents at the United States Attorney's office and identified certain documents that he thought were relevant. But he never opened several CD ROMS that the government had provided which contained all the documents that were available to Noonan at the United States Attorney's office. Moreover, Noonan did not attempt to interview any witness other than Theodore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the trial, Noonan did not have an office or support staff, and he in his own words planned \"to play it by ear and shoot from the hip.\" Noonan began his opening statement by stating that, \"I am rapidly approaching seventy. I have been retired for five years. I was never supposed to try this case.\" The court struck these comments as inappropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During cross examination of the government's witnesses, Noonan repeatedly asked open-ended questions. He was criticized by the court for being redundant and for having witnesses read from documents already admitted into evidence. At times, Noonan appeared unfamiliar with the rules of evidence, struggled to lay proper evidentiary foundations, and had difficulty hearing objections. His closing argument was interrupted by eight objections, all of which were sustained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noonan was also unfamiliar with the federal subpoena process and ultimately subpoenaed only one witness. The witness filed a motion to quash claiming that he had no relevant information. The trial judge held an impromptu hearing on March 2, 2001, to deal with the motion, but Noonan was unaware that the hearing had been scheduled and did not attend. At the hearing, the court concluded that the witness \"had nothing relevant to say\" and allowed the motion to quash \"subject to reconsideration.\" Noonan never sought reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of this factual predicate, the district court concluded that Theodore was entitled to a new trial. The court first ruled that \"Noonan's representation of Theodore clearly fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, easily satisfying the first part of the <i>Strickland</i> analysis.\" <i>Id.</i> at 129. The court then further concluded that prejudice should be presumed in these circumstances because the government's case had \"never been subjected to the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted). According to the court, \"the lack of meaningful adversarial testing began with inadequate preparation and continued throughout every stage of Theodore's trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 130.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government appeals. Acknowledging that \"the overall impression left by [Noonan's] defense was abysmal,\" the government does not contest that Theodore satisfied the performance aspect of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The government contends, however, that the district court erroneously concluded that Noonan's performance was so egregious that prejudice should be presumed under <i>Cronic.</i> In the government's view, because Noonan did subject the prosecutor's case to some adversarial testing, Theodore was required to show actual prejudice under <i>Strickland.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We ordinarily review the grant or denial of a new trial motion for a manifest abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Conley,</i> 249 F.3d 38, 44 (1st Cir. 2001). Where, however, a party claims that the wrong legal standard was applied in adjudicating the motion, we review the claim de novo. <i>See United States v. Josleyn,</i> 206 F.3d 144, 151 (1st Cir.2000). Determining whether <i>Strickland's</i> actual prejudice standard or <i>Cronic's</i> presumed prejudice standard applies to Theodore's new trial motion is a mixed question of law and fact subject to de novo review. <i>See Scarpa v. DuBois,</i> 38 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1994); <i>see also Haynes v. Cain,</i> 272 F.3d 757, 761 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As mentioned earlier, a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim generally requires the defendant to demonstrate actual prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's deficient performance, the result of the trial would have been different. <i>See Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. 2052. There is an exception, however, where \"counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Cronic,</i> 466 U.S. at 659, 104 S.Ct. 2039. In such cases, prejudice is presumed. <i>Id.</i> But the <i>Cronic</i> exception is exceedingly narrow, <i>see Florida v. Nixon,</i> 543 U.S. 175, 190, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565 (2004), and applies where the defendant has demonstrated that \"the attorney's failure [was] complete,\" <i>Bell v. Cone,</i> 535 U.S. 685, 696-97, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002). In other words, \"the circumstances leading to counsel's ineffectiveness [must be] so egregious that the defendant was in effect denied any meaningful assistance at all.\" <i>United States v. Griffin,</i> 324 F.3d 330, 364 (5th Cir.2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Cronic</i> exception has been applied in cases where counsel slept as evidence was being introduced against the defendant, <i>Burdine v. Johnson,</i> 262 F.3d 336, 338 (5th Cir.2001) (en banc), where counsel adopted and acted upon a belief that his client should be convicted, <i>Osborn v. Shillinger,</i> 861 F.2d 612, 625 (10th Cir.1988), and where counsel sat silently throughout the entire trial, <i>see Harding v. Davis,</i> 878 F.2d 1341, 1345 (11th Cir.1989). But it has been held inapplicable to cases involving \"bad lawyering, regardless of how bad.\" <i>Scarpa,</i> 38 F.3d at 13 (citation omitted). \"Attorney error, even when egregious, . . . almost always require[s] analysis under <i>Strickland's</i> prejudice prong.\" <i>Id.</i> at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Bell</i> demonstrates the narrowness of the <i>Cronic</i> exception. <i>See</i> 535 U.S. at 696-97, 122 S.Ct. 1843. During the sentencing phase of a capital murder trial, defense counsel took three actions on behalf of his client: he made a brief opening statement asking for mercy and referencing that the defendant suffered Vietnam Veterans Syndrome; he established on cross-examination that the defendant had received the Bronze Star during his Vietnam service; and he successfully objected to the introduction of two photographs of the murder victims. <i>Id.</i> at 708, 122 S.Ct. 1843. But counsel did not interview any witnesses relevant to the guilt phase; present mitigation testimony from the defendant's relatives who were available to testify; or make a closing statement. <i>Id.</i> at 708-10, 122 S.Ct. 1843. Despite counsel's meager efforts, the Supreme Court determined that the defendant had not demonstrated that counsel failed <i>entirely</i> to oppose the prosecution; rather, the defendant showed only that counsel failed to oppose the prosecution \"at specific points\" in the proceeding. <i>Id.</i> at 696-97, 122 S.Ct. 1843. Therefore, the Court held that <i>Cronic's</i> presumed prejudice standard did not apply. <i>Id.</i> at 697, 122 S.Ct. 1843.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noonan's performance resembles the attorney's performance in <i>Bell.</i> While Noonan's representation of Theodore suffered significant shortcomings, it was not tantamount to non-representation. Prior to trial, Noonan reviewed boxes of documents, \"looked at every single cotton-picking piece of paper,\" and asked the government to provide copies of those documents he thought relevant. Noonan also filed pretrial motions on Theodore's behalf, including a non-frivolous motion arguing that a recent Supreme Court decision required the dismissal of the mail fraud charges. During voir dire, Noonan exercised several peremptory challenges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noonan also participated in the trial itself. He presented an opening during which he touched on several themes, including that Theodore's conduct was beyond the statute of limitations; that someone else was responsible for the illegal conduct; and that \"LK-200\" was not a drug and therefore not subject to the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. He cross-examined all of the government witnesses, and he occasionally asked questions that returned to the themes mentioned in the opening. Noonan also introduced nine defense exhibits that related in some degree to the defense themes, filed a Fed. R.Crim.P. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal, and made a closing argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summarizing Noonan's performance, the district court recognized that Noonan had \"cross-examined the government witnesses, suggested some defense themes, and introduced a few exhibits.\" <i>Theodore,</i> 345 F.Supp.2d at 126-27. Such minimal performance is sufficient to remove this case from <i>Cronic's</i> ambit. <i>See, e.g., Bell,</i> 535 U.S. at 696-97, 122 S.Ct. 1843; <i>Barrow v. Uchtman,</i> 398 F.3d 597, 603 n. 4 (7th Cir.2005) (concluding that <i>Cronic</i> did not apply where counsel presented no evidence in defendant's capital case but did present an opening or closing argument and conducted some cross-examinations); <i>Millender v. Adams,</i> 376 F.3d 520, 524 (6th Cir.2004) (concluding that <i>Cronic</i> did not apply where counsel cross-examined witnesses, made objections, and presented a closing argument); <i>Hooper v. Mullin,</i> 314 F.3d 1162, 1175 (10th Cir.2002) (concluding that <i>Cronic</i> did not apply where counsel cross-examined witnesses, made objections, presented some evidence favoring defendant, and made an opening and closing argument); <i>Fink v. Lockhart,</i> 823 F.2d 204, 206 (8th Cir.1987) (concluding that <i>Cronic</i> did not apply where defense counsel used peremptory challenges, cross-examined witnesses, and made a closing argument). This is not to say that Noonan's performance was acceptable. Indeed, it undoubtedly fell below the \"very forgiving\" Sixth Amendment standard for effective assistance of counsel. <i>Delgado v. Lewis,</i> 223 F.3d 976, 981 (9th Cir.2000). But Noonan's conduct was not so deficient that Theodore should have been relieved from demonstrating actual prejudice under <i>Strickland.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Theodore has presented an alternative argument for affirming the new trial order. He contends that even if prejudice was incorrectly presumed under <i>Cronic,</i> he has demonstrated actual prejudice under <i>Strickland.</i> The government disagrees and further contends that Theodore forfeited the actual prejudice argument by failing to raise it in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the circumstances of this case, we do not find that Theodore has forfeited his actual prejudice claim. During Theodore's opening remarks at the post-trial evidentiary hearing, counsel stated that Theodore would present evidence showing that if Noonan had done a better job \"it would have made a difference.\" Counsel also specifically distinguished Theodore's <i>Strickland</i> argument from his <i>Cronic</i> argument by telling the court that, at the conclusion of the hearing, Theodore \"will have met the <i>Strickland</i> test [and] will also have met the test to show that Noonan . . . constructively abandoned [him].\" And, in Theodore's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, he specifically requested a ruling on actual prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that Theodore did not fully develop the actual prejudice issue before the district court. But this resulted from the manner in which events unfolded and not from any decision to abandon the actual prejudice argument. On the first day of the evidentiary hearing, Noonan and the trial judge testified concerning Noonan's performance. At the start of the second day of the hearing, the district court announced that, based on the first day's testimony, it had decided to order a new trial under <i>Cronic.</i> The court offered the government the opportunity to withdraw its opposition to Theodore's motion, but the government declined, so the court permitted the hearing to continue to a conclusion. Given the court's statement that it had already decided to allow the new trial motion on presumed prejudice grounds, we will not fault Theodore for declining to make a detailed presentation on actual prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lack of a complete evidentiary record does, however, prevent us from accepting Theodore's invitation to resolve the actual prejudice issue on this appeal. The issue largely turns on documents that are not properly within the appellate record. Moreover, the record, as currently constituted, lacks an adequate description of the precise evidence that Theodore would present if a retrial were ordered. We therefore <i>vacate</i> the new trial order and <i>remand</i> to the district court to consider, upon further submissions or after hearing, whether Theodore has demonstrated actual prejudice under <i>Strickland. See Dugas v. Coplan,</i> 428 F.3d 317, 342-43 (1st Cir. 2005) (remanding for further record development on whether the defendant could establish actual prejudice under <i>Strickland</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Theodore filed a notice of cross-appeal (No. 05-1120), which the government moved to dismiss on the ground that Theodore's brief did not include any argument supporting a cross-appeal.

The government appeals, arguing that the court erred in presuming prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2000, a grand jury indicted Theodore on nine counts of mail fraud, 19 U.S.C. &#167; 341, and three counts of violating the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 331(a), (d), &amp; (p). The indictment alleged that from 1992 until 1995, Theodore and a business partner solicited over $1.5 million in investments by claiming that Theodore had invented a promising new anti-cancer drug called \"LK-200.\" Investors were told that the drug was manufactured by means of a secret process at overseas facilities because it had not been approved for domestic production. In fact, there was nothing secret about \"LK-200,\" which is a well-known biological substance that is produced domestically. Over the life of the scam, Theodore made misstatements to investors about himself and the product, including representations that he was a medical doctor. Theodore also directed the manufacture of \"LK-200\" in unsanitary conditions that made it unsafe for use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the indictment, Theodore initially was represented by Attorney John Bostinalli, but Bostinalli quickly withdrew from the case. Theodore then was represented by Attorney Gordon White, a Texas attorney who appeared pro hac vice, with Massachusetts Attorney John Noonan serving as local counsel. During the period that White and Noonan represented Theodore, White was lead counsel. However, while White never formally withdrew from the case, he last appeared for Theodore at a motion hearing in October 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 1, 2001, Noonan represented Theodore at a pretrial conference. At this hearing, it became apparent that White no longer represented Theodore and that Noonan was the sole defense counsel. Noonan had been a lawyer for over forty years, but had never tried a federal court case. The district court asked Noonan if he felt comfortable representing Theodore. Noonan responded that he was afraid that his continuing participation could create a Sixth Amendment issue because he was not competent to try the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, Noonan formally moved to withdraw and have new counsel appointed. The government responded that Noonan had been involved in the case from the early stages and that he seemed familiar with the issues. The district court denied Noonan's motion and instead appointed standby counsel to advise Noonan about federal procedure. At this point, Theodore objected to having Noonan represent him. The court overruled the objection and ordered that trial commence ten days later, with Noonan serving as sole defense counsel. After a fifteen-day trial, Theodore was convicted on all counts of the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court appointed new counsel to represent Theodore at sentencing and in connection with any post-trial motions he wished to file. Theodore subsequently filed a motion for a new trial, asserting ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court denied Theodore's motion without holding an evidentiary hearing. Applying <i>Strickland,</i> the court ruled that, even if Noonan's performance was deficient, the government's case was so overwhelming that Theodore could not possibly establish prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Theodore appealed. <i>See United States v. Theodore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200770\"><a href=\"/opinion/200770/united-states-v-theodore/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2003). We upheld part of the appeal and remanded, concluding that the district court \"abused its discretion by not holding an evidentiary hearing to resolve or clarify factual issues ultimately crucial to Theodore's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\" <i>Id.</i> at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district judge who had presided over the trial and denied the new trial motion recused himself. A new district judge held the required evidentiary hearing. Following the conclusion of this hearing, the district court made detailed findings concerning Noonan's performance, which we now summarize. <i>See Theodore,</i> 345 F.Supp.2d at 126-28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noonan's pretrial investigation was incomplete. He reviewed boxes of documents at the United States Attorney's office and identified certain documents that he thought were relevant. But he never opened several CD ROMS that the government had provided which contained all the documents that were available to Noonan at the United States Attorney's office. Moreover, Noonan did not attempt to interview any witness other than Theodore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the trial, Noonan did not have an office or support staff, and he in his own words planned \"to play it by ear and shoot from the hip.\" Noonan began his opening statement by stating that, \"I am rapidly approaching seventy. I have been retired for five years. I was never supposed to try this case.\" The court struck these comments as inappropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During cross examination of the government's witnesses, Noonan repeatedly asked open-ended questions. He was criticized by the court for being redundant and for having witnesses read from documents already admitted into evidence. At times, Noonan appeared unfamiliar with the rules of evidence, struggled to lay proper evidentiary foundations, and had difficulty hearing objections. His closing argument was interrupted by eight objections, all of which were sustained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noonan was also unfamiliar with the federal subpoena process and ultimately subpoenaed only one witness. The witness filed a motion to quash claiming that he had no relevant information. The trial judge held an impromptu hearing on March 2, 2001, to deal with the motion, but Noonan was unaware that the hearing had been scheduled and did not attend. At the hearing, the court concluded that the witness \"had nothing relevant to say\" and allowed the motion to quash \"subject to reconsideration.\" Noonan never sought reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of this factual predicate, the district court concluded that Theodore was entitled to a new trial. The court first ruled that \"Noonan's representation of Theodore clearly fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, easily satisfying the first part of the <i>Strickland</i> analysis.\" <i>Id.</i> at 129. The court then further concluded that prejudice should be presumed in these circumstances because the government's case had \"never been subjected to the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted). According to the court, \"the lack of meaningful adversarial testing began with inadequate preparation and continued throughout every stage of Theodore's trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 130.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government appeals. Acknowledging that \"the overall impression left by [Noonan's] defense was abysmal,\" the government does not contest that Theodore satisfied the performance aspect of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The government contends, however, that the district court erroneously concluded that Noonan's performance was so egregious that prejudice should be presumed under <i>Cronic.</i> In the government's view, because Noonan did subject the prosecutor's case to some adversarial testing, Theodore was required to show actual prejudice under <i>Strickland.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We ordinarily review the grant or denial of a new trial motion for a manifest abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v.

Determining whether <i>Strickland's</i> actual prejudice standard or <i>Cronic's</i> presumed prejudice standard applies to Theodore's new trial motion is a mixed question of law and fact subject to de novo review. <i>See Scarpa v.

Prior to trial, Noonan reviewed boxes of documents, \"looked at every single cotton-picking piece of paper,\" and asked the government to provide copies of those documents he thought relevant. Noonan also filed pretrial motions on Theodore's behalf, including a non-frivolous motion arguing that a recent Supreme Court decision required the dismissal of the mail fraud charges.

He presented an opening during which he touched on several themes, including that Theodore's conduct was beyond the statute of limitations; that someone else was responsible for the illegal conduct; and that \"LK-200\" was not a drug and therefore not subject to the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. He cross-examined all of the government witnesses, and he occasionally asked questions that returned to the themes mentioned in the opening. Noonan also introduced nine defense exhibits that related in some degree to the defense themes, filed a Fed.

He contends that even if prejudice was incorrectly presumed under <i>Cronic,</i> he has demonstrated actual prejudice under <i>Strickland.</i> The government disagrees and further contends that Theodore forfeited the actual prejudice argument by failing to raise it in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the circumstances of this case, we do not find that Theodore has forfeited his actual prejudice claim. During Theodore's opening remarks at the post-trial evidentiary hearing, counsel stated that Theodore would present evidence showing that if Noonan had done a better job \"it would have made a difference.\" Counsel also specifically distinguished Theodore's <i>Strickland</i> argument from his <i>Cronic</i> argument by telling the court that, at the conclusion of the hearing, Theodore \"will have met the <i>Strickland</i> test [and] will also have met the test to show that Noonan . . . constructively abandoned [him].\" And, in Theodore's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, he specifically requested a ruling on actual prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that Theodore did not fully develop the actual prejudice issue before the district court. But this resulted from the manner in which events unfolded and not from any decision to abandon the actual prejudice argument. On the first day of the evidentiary hearing, Noonan and the trial judge testified concerning Noonan's performance. At the start of the second day of the hearing, the district court announced that, based on the first day's testimony, it had decided to order a new trial under <i>Cronic.</i> The court offered the government the opportunity to withdraw its opposition to Theodore's motion, but the government declined, so the court permitted the hearing to continue to a conclusion. Given the court's statement that it had already decided to allow the new trial motion on presumed prejudice grounds, we will not fault Theodore for declining to make a detailed presentation on actual prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lack of a complete evidentiary record does, however, prevent us from accepting Theodore's invitation to resolve the actual prejudice issue on this appeal. The issue largely turns on documents that are not properly within the appellate record. Moreover, the record, as currently constituted, lacks an adequate description of the precise evidence that Theodore would present if a retrial were ordered.
