Justo Arenas, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                     Torruella, Lipez, and Howard,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Charles F. Wilson, with whom Nevins & Nevins LLP was on\nbrief,for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                              January 18, 2006\n\f              Per Curiam.     Roman Ramos-Acevedo was found by customs\n\ninspectors     to   be   carrying   over   a     kilogram   of   heroin    after\n\ndisembarking a cruise ship in San Juan, Puerto Rico.                He pleaded\n\nguilty to possessing with intent to distribute and importing the\n\nheroin, see 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a) & 952(a), but reserved the right to\n\nappeal both the denial of a suppression motion filed prior to the\n\nplea and his sentence.\n\n              We start with the denial of the suppression motion.           The\n\nheroin was discovered after a series of events Ramos challenged\n\nboth below and in his appellate brief as constituting a non-routine\n\nborder search unsupported by reasonable suspicion.                  See United\n\nStates   v.    Montoya   De   Hernandez,   473    U.S.   531,    538-41   (1985)\n\n(routine border searches may be conducted as a matter of course,\n\nbut non-routine searches must be supported by reasonable suspicion\n\nof criminal activity).        At oral argument, however, Ramos correctly\n\nconceded that the only incident in this series which was even\n\narguably non-routine was a custom inspector’s act of reaching into\n\nRamos’s front pocket a short time before the discovery of the\n\nheroin – an act which, Ramos says, led him to admit his crimes.\n\nBut the problem with this argument is that the magistrate judge who\n\nconducted the hearing on the suppression motion found that the\n\ncustoms agent did not reach into Ramos’s pocket, and Ramos did not\n\nobject to this finding in challenging the magistrate judge’s report\n\nand recommendation.       Ramos thus “irretrievably waive[d] any right\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fto review [of this finding] by the district court and the court of\n\nappeals.”    Santiago v. Cannon U.S.A., Inc., 138 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).   And nothing in the record leads us to believe that the\n\ncircumstances call for intervention under Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b)\n\n(describing power of appellate courts to notice plain errors).\n\n            Ramos’s challenge to his sentence also fails.      Ramos\n\ncontends that he is entitled to resentencing under United States v.\n\nBooker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), but he received the statutory\n\nminimum sentence and thus could not possibly fare better if we were\n\nto remand.    See United States v. Bermudez, 407 F.3d 536, 545 (1st\n\nCir. 2005); United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f",
