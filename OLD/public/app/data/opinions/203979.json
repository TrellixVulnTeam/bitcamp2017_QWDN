Plaintiff-appellants Charles\n\nSantana-Castro (\"Santana\") and his grandparents Félix Santana-\n\nCarmona and Aida Santana-Castro filed an action in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Puerto Rico against\n\ndefendant-appellees Puerto Rico Police Department (\"PRPD\") officers\n\nand their supervisors.       Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, plaintiffs\n\nalleged violations of their constitutional rights under the First,\n\nFourth, Fifth, Tenth, and Fourteenth Amendments as well as claims\n\nunder Puerto Rico's constitution and civil law.\n\n           In their complaint, plaintiffs specifically alleged that\n\nfour PRPD officers illegally arrested, beat, and incarcerated\n\nSantana, causing him physical injuries, and causing him and his\n\ngrandparents emotional distress.            They also claimed that PRPD\n\nsupervisors were liable under a theory of supervisory liability and\n\nthat Santana was illegally fired from the PRPD in retaliation for\n\nbringing legal action against the PRPD.           In response, defendants\n\nfiled a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.                   The\n\ndistrict court initially dismissed some of the claims, and upon a\n\nsubsequent motion for reconsideration, it dismissed all remaining\n\nclaims   as   time-barred.      Plaintiffs     appeal.       After   careful\n\nconsideration,    we   affirm   the    district    court's    dismissal   of\n\nplaintiff's complaint as untimely.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f                                I.     Background\n\n              As this case comes to us as a motion to dismiss, \"'we\n\nmust take all the factual allegations in the complaint as true.'\"\n\nMaldonado v. Fontánes, 568 F.3d 263, 266 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting\n\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1950 (2009)).                  The following\n\nfacts are based on Santana's complaint and the extrajudicial claim\n\nletter   he     sent    to   PRPD    Superintendent      Pedro     Toledo-Dávila\n\n(\"Toledo\"), which was attached to the complaint.                 See Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 10(c) (\"A copy of a written instrument that is an exhibit to a\n\npleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes.\"); Blackstone\n\nRealty LLC v. FDIC, 244 F.3d 193, 195 n.1 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n              Santana worked as a police officer in the PRPD from 2002\n\nto 2007.      On June 8, 2006, while off-duty, he had dinner at a\n\nrestaurant in Luquillo, Puerto Rico.             While at dinner, his car was\n\nvandalized and his car radio stolen.             Upon discovering the damage\n\nto his car, Santana met an individual on the street named Angel\n\nCruz-García (\"Cruz\"), who informed Santana that he had seen two\n\nsuspicious men in the area with a bag.              Thinking they might have\n\nbeen the individuals who damaged the car, Santana and Cruz went to\n\na housing project to look for the men Cruz had seen.\n\n              When they could not find the two men Cruz suspected\n\nvandalized the car, Santana and Cruz left the housing project.\n\nThey   were    then    pulled   over    by    Officers   Jesús    Sánchez-Zavala\n\n(\"Sánchez\") and Israel Candelaria-Vélez (\"Candelaria\").                    A few\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fminutes later, Officers Dionisio Molina-Padró (\"Molina\") and José\n\nLebrón-Alicea (\"Lebrón\") also arrived at the scene.                          The four\n\nofficers searched Santana's car and arrested him and Cruz for\n\npossession of crack cocaine. During the arrest, Sánchez and Molina\n\nallegedly hit Santana and handcuffed him tightly, causing Santana\n\nsevere pain and several hematomas.              The officers also humiliated\n\nSantana, calling him a corrupt officer and a junkie.                   The officers\n\nthen brought Santana to the Luquillo Police Station where they kept\n\nhim   incarcerated       for   fifteen    hours    without      food    or    medical\n\nattention.\n\n              The following day, on June 9, 2006, Santana was taken to\n\nSan Juan Superior Court and charged with possession of illegal\n\ndrugs   and    driving    without    a   vehicle    registration       plate.      On\n\nJuly 21, 2006, Santana was suspended from the PRPD without pay.                    He\n\nnever returned to work.1            On February 7, 2007, in a preliminary\n\nhearing, a state court judge held that the PRPD officers who\n\nstopped Santana and searched his car lacked probable cause.                       The\n\ncourt dismissed the charges against Santana.\n\n              On May 18, 2007, Santana and his grandparents sent a\n\nletter through their lawyer to PRPD Superintendent Toledo, who\n\nreceived the letter on May 21, 2007.                The letter described the\n\nevents of June 8 and 9, 2006, including Santana's arrest, beating,\n\n\n\n1\n     Santana received          an    official     letter   of    termination       on\nSeptember 12, 2007.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fand incarceration by the four officers at the scene, who are all\n\nmentioned by name.        It also noted that Santana was \"summarily\n\nexpelled\" from his job \"as a result\" of the charges filed against\n\nhim.   The letter stated that \"[t]hese actions and/or omissions by\n\nthe aforementioned agents caused damages and losses,\" including\n\n\"severe mental anguish\" to Santana's grandparents who had to\n\nwitness \"the injustices committed against their grandson.\"              The\n\nletter alleged that \"[t]he blows that [Santana] received, the\n\nfiling   of   unfounded    criminal    charges   against   him,   and   the\n\npublication of all this in the news media, constitute a violation\n\nof his civil rights.\"2      The letter then requested $1.5 million in\n\ndamages \"as an indemnity for the damages and losses caused by the\n\npolice officers referred to above.\"\n\n            On September 7, 2007, Santana and his grandparents filed\n\na complaint in federal court against the four officers who had been\n\nat the scene of the arrest and also against three supervising\n\nofficers - Superintendent Toledo, José Ramos-González (\"Ramos\"),\n\nCommander of the Fajardo Region of the PRPD, and Nelson Torres-\n\nGonzález (\"Torres\"), Commander of the Special Operations Unit of\n\nthe PRPD.     On November 21, 2007, the three supervising officers\n\nfiled a motion to dismiss.     On December 21, 2007, plaintiffs filed\n\n\n2\n   The letter stated that the claim is \"made under the protection\nof . . . the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and\nthe United States of America, articles 1802 and 1803 of the Puerto\nRico Civil Code, 32 LPRA, secs 5141 and 5142 and the federal Civil\nRights Law, 42 USC 1983.\"\n\n                                      -5-\n\fan opposition to the motion to dismiss and leave to file an amended\n\ncomplaint, which was granted by the district court.                      On January 4,\n\n2008, plaintiffs filed the amended complaint, which again stated\n\nclaims against the on-scene officers for violating Santana's civil\n\nrights    and   against       the    supervising    officers       for    supervisory\n\nliability.      It also included a claim alleging that Santana was\n\nfired as a result of his arrest and the charges brought against\n\nhim, which constituted an illegal termination because the PRPD did\n\nnot   investigate     the     events    of   June   8   and   9,    2006     prior   to\n\nterminating Santana.          On April 4, 2008, Lebrón and Molina joined\n\ntheir co-defendants' earlier filed motion to dismiss.                       On May 7,\n\n2008, Candelaria and Sánchez also joined the motion to dismiss.\n\n             On or about May 12, 2008, the district court issued a\n\npartial     dismissal    of    the    complaint,    dismissing       the    following\n\nclaims: (1) all claims alleged against the supervising officers;\n\n(2)   all    claims     brought      under   the    First,    Fifth,       and   Tenth\n\nAmendments; (3) all claims brought against the on-scene officers in\n\ntheir official capacities as police officers; and (4) all claims\n\nbrought by Santana's grandparents pursuant to § 1983.                      This order\n\nleft the claims against the on-scene officers in their personal\n\ncapacities, pursuant to § 1983 for violations of Santana's Fourth\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fand Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as all claims brought\n\nunder Puerto Rico law against the on-scene officers.3\n\n           Following     the   partial   dismissal,        both   parties   filed\n\nmotions   for    reconsideration.             The    district     court    granted\n\ndefendants'     motion   and   issued    an    amended    opinion    and    order,\n\ndismissing all of plaintiffs' remaining claims with prejudice as\n\ntime-barred.     Plaintiffs timely appeal.             For the reasons stated\n\nbelow, we affirm the district court and hold that plaintiffs'\n\nextrajudicial letter did not toll the statute of limitations under\n\nPuerto Rico law, rendering his complaint untimely.\n\n                               II.   Discussion\n\n           We   first    consider    whether        plaintiffs'   complaint   was\n\nproperly time-barred.      Defendants argue that plaintiffs filed the\n\noriginal complaint after the applicable statute of limitations had\n\nrun.   They further argue that the extrajudicial letter plaintiffs\n\nsent to Toledo failed to toll the limitations period.                 Defendants\n\ncontend that the letter notified Toledo that he might be sued only\n\nin his official capacity as an employee of the PRPD, which is\n\nprecluded by the Eleventh Amendment. We agree with defendants that\n\nthe complaint was time-barred, albeit for different reasons.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  This order did not mention the illegal termination claim raised\nin the amended complaint.\n\n                                      -7-\n\f            A.     Applicable Law Governing Statute of Limitations\n\n            We review de novo the district court's dismissal of a\n\ncomplaint    for    failure    to   state       a   claim    based   on   statute   of\n\nlimitations grounds.          López-González v. Municipality of Comerío,\n\n404 F.3d 548, 551 (1st Cir. 2005).              \"Affirmative defenses, such as\n\nthe statute of limitations, may be raised in a motion to dismiss\n\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), provided that \"the\n\nfacts establishing the defense [are] clear 'on the face of the\n\nplaintiff's       pleadings.'\"           Trans-Spec       Truck   Serv.,     Inc.   v.\n\nCaterpillar, Inc., 524 F.3d 315, 321 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting\n\nBlackstone Realty LLC, 244 F.3d at 197). \"Where the dates included\n\nin the complaint show that the limitations period has been exceeded\n\nand the complaint fails to 'sketch a factual predicate' that would\n\nwarrant     the    application      of     either     a     different     statute   of\n\nlimitations        period     or    equitable         estoppel,      dismissal      is\n\nappropriate.\"       Id.\n\n            Plaintiffs' complaint brought claims under § 1983, which\n\nborrows the forum state's statute of limitations for personal\n\ninjury claims.       Rodríguez-García v. Municipality of Caguas, 354\n\nF.3d 91, 96 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing Wilson v. García, 471 U.S. 261,\n\n277-80 (1985)).        The parties agree that Puerto Rico's one-year\n\nprescriptive period governing tort actions is the statute of\n\nlimitations applicable to plaintiffs' claims. See id. (citing P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 31, § 5298(2)).            While we look to Puerto Rico law to\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fdetermine    the   applicable   prescriptive   period,    \"federal    law\n\ndetermines the date on which the claim accrued.\"         Id. at 96.   The\n\nlimitations period \"begins to run when the plaintiff 'knows or has\n\nreason to know of the injury which is the basis for his claim.'\"\n\nId. at 96-97 (quoting Rodríguez Narváez v. Nazario, 895 F.2d 38, 41\n\nn.5 (1st Cir. 1990)).      The \"limitations period of actions is a\n\nsubstantive, not a procedural, matter\" in Puerto Rico.         Rodríguez\n\nv. Suzuki Motor Corp., 570 F.3d 402, 406 (1st Cir. 2009) (citing\n\nGarcía Pérez v. Corporación de Servicios para la Mujer y la\n\nFamilia, etc., 2008 TSPR 114, 2008 WL 2717833, at *4 (P.R. June 30,\n\n2008)).    Thus, we apply Puerto Rico's tolling rules.\n\n            Puerto Rico's tolling rules provide three ways that a\n\nplaintiff can interrupt the statute of limitations, which, as\n\nrelevant here, include the sending of an \"extrajudicial\" letter.\n\nSee P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5303.      \"[A] letter sent by a tort\n\nplaintiff to the tortfeasor, complaining of the tortious conduct\n\nand demanding compensation, is an extrajudicial claim that, if\n\ntimely, interrupts the prescription of the cause of action in\n\ntort.\"    Tokyo Marine & Fire Ins. Co. v. Pérez y Cía. de P.R., Inc.,\n\n142 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st. Cir. 1998).        We note, however, that an\n\nextrajudicial letter will not toll the limitations period \"'for all\n\nclaims arising out of the same facts.'\"        Municipality of Caguas,\n\n354 F.3d at 97 (quoting Fernández v. Chardón, 681 F.2d 42, 49 (1st\n\nCir. 1982)). The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has limited the tolling\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\feffect of an extrajudicial letter to situations where the letter is\n\n\"identical\" to a subsequently filed complaint. Id. (citing Cintrón\n\nv. Estado Libre Asociado de P.R., 27 P.R. Offic. Trans. 582\n\n(1990)).    This identicality requirement has three components.\n\nFirst, the extrajudicial letter and subsequent complaint \"must seek\n\nthe same form of relief.\"        Id. at 98.   Second, \"[t]he causes of\n\naction asserted [in the complaint] must be based on the same\n\nsubstantive claims\" as asserted in the extrajudicial letter.         Id.\n\nLastly, \"provided that other Puerto Rico tolling statutes do not\n\nrescue the claims on other grounds, they must be asserted against\n\nthe same defendants in the same capacities; new defendants should\n\nnot be added.\"   Id.\n\n           Before we proceed to our analysis as to whether the\n\nidenticality requirement is met here, we note some tension in the\n\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court's approach to identicality and its\n\ntolling provisions.    On the one hand, it has stated, and we have\n\noften repeated, that the \"tolling provisions [are] interpreted\n\nrestrictively    against   the    party   invoking   their   protection.\"\n\nNieves-Vega v. Ortiz-Quiñones, 443 F.3d 134, 137 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(quoting Rodríguez Narváez, 895 F.2d at 43); see also Díaz de Diana\n\nv. A.J.A.S., 10 P.R. Offic. Trans. 602, 608 n.1 (1980).           On the\n\nother hand, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has also stated that\n\nextrajudicial claims should be analyzed in [their] \"totality and in\n\na liberal fashion,\"    Pitts v. United States, 109 F.3d 832, 835 n.4\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f951   (1st Cir. 1997) (citing Zambrana Maldonado v. Commonwealth,\n\n129 D.P.R. 740, 1992 WL 755000 (P.R. Jan. 30, 1992)).             Also,\n\nconsistent with a more liberal approach to tolling, the Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme Court has remarked that it favors conservation of rights as\n\n\"the norm.\"    See Kery v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 931 F. Supp. 947, 952\n\n(D.P.R. 1995); Galib-Frangie v. El Vocero de Puerto Rico, 138\n\nD.P.R. 560, 1995 WL 905884 (P.R. June 6, 1995) (\"The prescription\n\nof the right is the exception, being its exercise or conservation\n\nthe norm, because of which the law propitiates the exercise and\n\nconservation    of   rights   through   the   use    of   prescription's\n\ninterruptive mechanisms.\").\n\n          Despite this potentially contradictory guidance, however,\n\nthe Puerto Rico Supreme Court has not departed from the principle\n\nthat an extrajudicial letter in order to toll the statute of\n\nlimitations with respect to subsequent claims must give fair notice\n\nof the claims that are subsequently raised.         It has explained the\n\nterm \"extrajudicial claim\" as follows:\n\n          Our Civil Code has not given to the word\n          \"claim\" any precise or technical meaning. But\n          this does not exempt us from trying to find\n          it. In principle, a claim stands for demand\n          or notice. That is: it is an act for which\n          the holder of a subjective right, addresses\n          the passive subject of said right, demanding\n          that he adopt the required conduct. The claim\n          is, then, a pretension in a technical sense.\n\nCintrón, 27 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 592.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f              Likewise, we have recognized this important principle in\n\nour case law, stating that \"[t]he identicality requirement prevents\n\nplaintiffs from circumventing the notice function of the statutes\n\nof limitations by asserting different claims in belated federal\n\ncourt complaints.\"          Municipality of Caguas, 354 F.3d at 97.\n\n                      1.    Identicality       and       Plaintiffs'      Supervisory\n                      Liability Claims\n\n              We first consider whether plaintiffs' extrajudicial claim\n\nletter is sufficiently identical to their subsequent complaint. As\n\nto the first identicality requirement, namely whether the same\n\nrelief      was   sought,    there    is   little    question       and,    in   fact,\n\ndefendants concede,4 that plaintiffs sought the same form of relief\n\n-- money damages -- both in the letter and in the subsequent\n\ncomplaint. That the letter requested a different amount in damages\n\n($1,500,000) than the complaint (over $4,000,000) is not a problem\n\nhere because the letter put Toledo on notice of a potential lawsuit\n\nfor damages.       See id. (\"Although the amount of damages differs in\n\nthe   two    complaints,      the    allegation     of    damages    in    her   state\n\ncomplaint gave the defendants the requisite 'fair notice that\n\n[they] might be called upon to defend a damages suit . . . .'\")\n\n(quoting Hernández del Valle v. Santa Aponte, 575 F.2d 321, 324\n\n(1st Cir. 1978) (alteration in original)).\n\n\n4\n   Defendants acknowledge that \"the letter does meet the first\nrequirement regarding the same form of relief, since money damages\nare sought in both the extrajudicial claim letter and the\ncomplaint.\"\n\n                                        -12-\n\f           Plaintiffs, however, do not fare as well with respect to\n\nthe second identicality requirement, namely whether the causes of\n\naction in the extrajudicial claim and subsequent complaint are\n\nbased on the same substantive claims.            As we have previously\n\nstated,   Puerto   Rico   law   requires   sufficient   detail   \"to   put\n\ndefendant on notice of the general nature of their claims.\"        Id. at\n\n100.   Here, we conclude that the extrajudicial letter did not\n\nassert a claim of supervisory liability in sufficient detail to\n\nmeet the second prong of the identicality requirement. We explain.\n\n           Plaintiffs'    complaint   asserted   that   the   subordinate\n\nofficers had a propensity of violence, that their supervisors knew\n\nof this propensity, and they did not act to correct it through\n\nretraining, psychological evaluation, or remedial action.         As part\n\nof the allegation of the subordinate officers' propensity for\n\nviolence, the complaint referred to \"incidents of unwarranted\n\nphysical violence against citizens.\"5        Although the extrajudical\n\nletter was addressed to Superintendent Toledo and mentioned § 1983\n\n\n\n\n5\n   In Maldonado, we noted that \"[s]ome recent language from the\nSupreme Court may call into question our prior circuit law on the\nstandard for holding a public official liable for damages under\n§ 1983 on a theory of supervisory liability.\" 568 F.3d at 275 n.7\n(citing Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937). This concern is not implicated\nhere because plaintiffs do not even allude to supervisory liability\nin their extrajudicial letter. Further, plaintiffs concede that\nthey do not meet the Iqbal standard with respect to their\nsupervisory liability claim in their complaint.\n\n                                   -13-\n\fin its penultimate sentence6 -- the letter failed to assert, even\n\nremotely, the factual allegations supporting supervisory liability\n\nthat ultimately were raised in the complaint.      Instead, the letter\n\nrecounted plaintiffs' version of the events of June 8 and 9,\n\nalleging that the actions and/or omissions of the officers who\n\nperpetrated the violence against him caused damages and losses.\n\nFurther, plaintiffs claimed that the arrest and filing of charges\n\nagainst Santana \"tarnished his reputation and violated his dignity\"\n\nbecause they were published in the newspapers and broadcast on the\n\nradio.   Even if we took a \"liberal\" approach in assessing this\n\nsecond prong, analyzing the letter in its \"totality,\" we cannot\n\nconclude that Toledo, or any of the other defendant supervisors,\n\nwould have been on sufficient notice to defend a supervisory\n\nliability claim.\n\n           Thus, we conclude that because plaintiffs' extrajudicial\n\nletter fails to satisfy the second identicality requirement, the\n\nsupervisory liability claim as to all defendant supervisors is\n\ntime-barred.7\n\n                   2.    Plaintiffs'    Claims   Against   the   On-Scene\n                   Officers\n\n           As to plaintiffs' claims against the on-scene officers,\n\nthe    extrajudicial    letter   states     with    \"precis[ion]     and\n\n\n6\n   Once again, the letter states that the claim is \"made under the\nprotection of . . . federal Civil Rights Law, 42 USC 1983.\"\n7\n    We need not reach the third identicality prong.\n\n                                 -14-\n\fspecific[ity],\" see Fernández, 681 F.2d at 53, the allegations of\n\nSantana's arrest, beating, and incarceration without proper medical\n\ntreatment.   However, the letter was addressed only to Toledo and\n\nplaintiffs do not allege that the on-scene officers accused of\n\nperpetrating the attack knew about the letter or its contents.\n\nThis is fatal to plaintiffs' claim.    Puerto Rico law is clear that\n\nthe extrajudicial letter \"must be addressed to the . . . passive\n\nsubject of the right, not to third party.\"    See Velilla v. Pueblo\n\nSupermarket, 11 Offic. Trans. 732, 734-35 (1981); see also Pitts,\n\n109 F.3d at 835 (citing same principle); Rodríguez-Narváez, 895\n\nF.2d at 44 (same).   Plaintiffs have not pointed to any case, nor\n\nare we aware of one, where subordinate officers are held to be on\n\nconstructive notice of claims made against them in an extrajudicial\n\nletter to a supervising officer.8\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the district\n\ncourt properly dismissed plaintiffs' claims as time-barred.9\n\n\n8\n  Moreover, plaintiffs do not allege that the subordinate officers\n\"affirmatively induce[d] [plaintiffs] to address the extrajudicial\nclaim to the wrong party,\" potentially excusing plaintiffs from the\nrequirement to address the extrajudicial letter to the correct\nparty. Campos-Matos v. Evanstone Ins. Co., 208 F. Supp. 2d 170,\n173-74 (D.P.R. 2002) (citing Velilla for this proposition of law).\n9\n    We also affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs' other claims,\nincluding their malicious prosecution and wrongful termination\nclaims. First, malicious prosecution cannot be implicated on these\nfacts against these defendants because, although they arrested\nSantana, the officers were not responsible for bringing charges\nagainst him.    Second, plaintiffs have waived their wrongful\n\n                                -15-\n\f          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\ntermination claim by failing to sufficiently brief the argument in\ngeneral (or, in specific, their \"continuous and uninterrupted\nviolations\" theory with respect to this issue) on appeal.

Inst. of Tech., 950 F.2d\n13, 23 (1st Cir. 1991) (noting that \"the plaintiff has an\naffirmative responsibility to put his best foot forward in an\neffort to present some legal theory that will support his claim\").\n\n                               -16-\n\f",

Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, plaintiffs alleged violations of their constitutional rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth, Tenth, and Fourteenth Amendments as well as claims under Puerto Rico's constitution and civil law.</p>\n<p>In their complaint, plaintiffs specifically alleged that four PRPD officers illegally arrested, beat, and incarcerated Santana, causing him physical injuries, and causing him and his grandparents emotional distress. They also claimed that PRPD supervisors were liable under a theory of supervisory liability and that Santana was illegally fired from the PRPD in retaliation for bringing legal action against the PRPD. In response, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The district court initially dismissed some of the claims, and upon a subsequent motion for reconsideration, it dismissed all remaining claims as time-barred. Plaintiffs appeal. After careful consideration, we affirm the district court's dismissal of plaintiff's complaint as untimely.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As this case comes to us as a motion to dismiss, \"`we must take all the factual allegations in the complaint as true.'\" <i>Maldonado v. Fontánes,</i> 568 F.3d 263, 266 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting <i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1950, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009)). The following facts are based on Santana's complaint and the extrajudicial claim letter he sent to PRPD Superintendent Pedro Toledo-Dávila (\"Toledo\"), which was attached to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*112</span> complaint. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 10(c) (\"A copy of a written instrument that is an exhibit to a pleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes.\"); <i>Blackstone Realty LLC v. FDIC,</i> 244 F.3d 193, 195 n. 1 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>Santana worked as a police officer in the PRPD from 2002 to 2007. On June 8, 2006, while off-duty, he had dinner at a restaurant in Luquillo, Puerto Rico. While at dinner, his car was vandalized and his car radio stolen. Upon discovering the damage to his car, Santana met an individual on the street named Angel Cruz-García (\"Cruz\"), who informed Santana that he had seen two suspicious men in the area with a bag. Thinking they might have been the individuals who damaged the car, Santana and Cruz went to a housing project to look for the men Cruz had seen.</p>\n<p>When they could not find the two men Cruz suspected vandalized the car, Santana and Cruz left the housing project. They were then pulled over by Officers Jesús Sánchez-Zavala (\"Sánchez\") and Israel Candelaria-Vélez (\"Candelaria\"). A few minutes later, Officers Dionisio Molina-Padró (\"Molina\") and José Lebrón-Alicea (\"Lebrón\") also arrived at the scene. The four officers searched Santana's car and arrested him and Cruz for possession of crack cocaine. During the arrest, Sánchez and Molina allegedly hit Santana and handcuffed him tightly, causing Santana severe pain and several hematomas. The officers also humiliated Santana, calling him a corrupt officer and a junkie. The officers then brought Santana to the Luquillo Police Station where they kept him incarcerated for fifteen hours without food or medical attention.</p>\n<p>The following day, on June 9, 2006, Santana was taken to San Juan Superior Court and charged with possession of illegal drugs and driving without a vehicle registration plate. On July 21, 2006, Santana was suspended from the PRPD without pay. He never returned to work.<sup>[1]</sup> On February 7, 2007, in a preliminary hearing, a state court judge held that the PRPD officers who stopped Santana and searched his car lacked probable cause. The court dismissed the charges against Santana.</p>\n<p>On May 18, 2007, Santana and his grandparents sent a letter through their lawyer to PRPD Superintendent Toledo, who received the letter on May 21, 2007. The letter described the events of June 8 and 9, 2006, including Santana's arrest, beating, and incarceration by the four officers at the scene, who are all mentioned by name. It also noted that Santana was \"summarily expelled\" from his job \"as a result\" of the charges filed against him. The letter stated that \"[t]hese actions and/or omissions by the aforementioned agents caused damages and losses,\" including \"severe mental anguish\" to Santana's grandparents who had to witness \"the injustices committed against their grandson.\" The letter alleged that \"[t]he blows that [Santana] received, the filing of unfounded criminal charges against him, and the publication of all this in the news media, constitute a violation of his civil rights.\"<sup>[2]</sup> The letter then requested $1.5 million in damages \"as an indemnity for the damages and losses caused by the police officers referred to above.\"</p>\n<p>On September 7, 2007, Santana and his grandparents filed a complaint in federal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> court against the four officers who had been at the scene of the arrest and also against three supervising officers  Superintendent Toledo, José Ramos-González (\"Ramos\"), Commander of the Fajardo Region of the PRPD, and Nelson Torres-González (\"Torres\"), Commander of the Special Operations Unit of the PRPD. On November 21, 2007, the three supervising officers filed a motion to dismiss. On December 21, 2007, plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss and leave to file an amended complaint, which was granted by the district court. On January 4, 2008, plaintiffs filed the amended complaint, which again stated claims against the on-scene officers for violating Santana's civil rights and against the supervising officers for supervisory liability. It also included a claim alleging that Santana was fired as a result of his arrest and the charges brought against him, which constituted an illegal termination because the PRPD did not investigate the events of June 8 and 9, 2006 prior to terminating Santana. On April 4, 2008, Lebrón and Molina joined their co-defendants' earlier filed motion to dismiss. On May 7, 2008, Candelaria and Sánchez also joined the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>On or about May 12, 2008, the district court issued a partial dismissal of the complaint, dismissing the following claims: (1) all claims alleged against the supervising officers; (2) all claims brought under the First, Fifth, and Tenth Amendments; (3) all claims brought against the on-scene officers in their official capacities as police officers; and (4) all claims brought by Santana's grandparents pursuant to § 1983. This order left the claims against the on-scene officers in their personal capacities, pursuant to § 1983 for violations of Santana's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as all claims brought under Puerto Rico law against the on-scene officers.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Following the partial dismissal, both parties filed motions for reconsideration. The district court granted defendants' motion and issued an amended opinion and order, dismissing all of plaintiffs' remaining claims with prejudice as time-barred. Plaintiffs timely appeal. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the district court and hold that plaintiffs' extrajudicial letter did not toll the statute of limitations under Puerto Rico law, rendering his complaint untimely.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We first consider whether plaintiffs' complaint was properly time-barred. Defendants argue that plaintiffs filed the original complaint after the applicable statute of limitations had run. They further argue that the extrajudicial letter plaintiffs sent to Toledo failed to toll the limitations period. Defendants contend that the letter notified Toledo that he might be sued only in his official capacity as an employee of the PRPD, which is precluded by the Eleventh Amendment. We agree with defendants that the complaint was time-barred, albeit for different reasons.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Applicable Law Governing Statute of Limitations</h2>\n<p>We review <i>de novo</i> the district court's dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim based on statute of limitations grounds. <i>López-González v. Municipality of Comerío,</i> 404 F.3d 548, 551 (1st Cir.2005). \"Affirmative defenses, such as the statute of limitations, may be raised in a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), provided that the facts establishing the defense [are] clear `on the face of the plaintiff's pleadings.'\" <i>Trans-Spec Truck Serv., Inc. v. Caterpillar, Inc.,</i> 524 F.3d 315, 320 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Blackstone Realty LLC,</i> 244 F.3d at 197). \"Where the dates included in the complaint show that the limitations period has been exceeded and the complaint fails to `sketch a factual predicate' that would warrant the application of either a different statute of limitations period or equitable estoppel, dismissal is appropriate.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' complaint brought claims under § 1983, which borrows the forum state's statute of limitations for personal injury claims. <i>Rodríguez-García v. Municipality of Caguas,</i> 354 F.3d 91, 96 (1st Cir.2004) (citing <i>Wilson v. García,</i> 471 U.S. 261, 277-80, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985)). The parties agree that Puerto Rico's one-year prescriptive period governing tort actions is the statute of limitations applicable to plaintiffs' claims. <i>See id.</i> (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5298(2)). While we look to Puerto Rico law to determine the applicable prescriptive period, \"federal law determines the date on which the claim accrued.\" <i>Id.</i> at 96. The limitations period \"begins to run when the plaintiff `knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis for his claim.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 96-97 (quoting <i>Rodríguez Narváez v. Nazario,</i> 895 F.2d 38, 41 n. 5 (1st Cir.1990)). The \"limitations period of actions is a substantive, not a procedural, matter\" in Puerto Rico. <i>Rodríguez v. Suzuki Motor Corp.,</i> 570 F.3d 402, 406 (1st Cir.2009) (citing <i>García Pérez v. Corporación de Servicios para la Mujer y la Familia, etc.,</i> 2008 TSPR 114, 2008 WL 2717833, at *4 (P.R. June 30, 2008)). Thus, we apply Puerto Rico's tolling rules.</p>\n<p>Puerto Rico's tolling rules provide three ways that a plaintiff can interrupt the statute of limitations, which, as relevant here, include the sending of an \"extrajudicial\" letter. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5303. \"[A] letter sent by a tort plaintiff to the tortfeasor, complaining of the tortious conduct and demanding compensation, is an extrajudicial claim that, if timely, interrupts the prescription of the cause of action in tort.\" <i>Tokyo Marine &amp; Fire Ins. Co. v. Pérez y Cía. De P.R., Inc.,</i> 142 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st. Cir.1998). We note, however, that an extrajudicial letter will not toll the limitations \"period \"`for all claims arising out of the same facts.'\" <i>Municipality of Caguas,</i> 354 F.3d at 97 (quoting <i>Fernández v. Chardón,</i> 681 F.2d 42, 49 (1st Cir.1982)). The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has limited the tolling effect of an extrajudicial letter to situations where the letter is \"identical\" to a subsequently filed complaint. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Cintrón v. Estado Libre Asociado de P.R.,</i> 27 P.R. Offic. Trans. 582, 1990 WL 658719 (1990)). This identicality requirement has three components. First, the extrajudicial letter and subsequent complaint \"must seek the same form of relief.\" <i>Id.</i> at 98. Second, \"[t]he causes of action asserted [in the complaint] must be based on the same substantive claims\" as asserted in the extrajudicial letter. <i>Id.</i> Lastly, \"provided that other Puerto Rico tolling statutes do not rescue the claims on other grounds, they must be asserted against the same defendants in the same capacities; new defendants should not be added.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Before we proceed to our analysis as to whether the identicality requirement is met here, we note some tension in the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's approach to identicality and its tolling provisions. On the one hand, it has stated, and we have often repeated, that the \"tolling provisions [are] interpreted restrictively against the party invoking their protection.\" <i>Nieves-Vega v. Ortiz-Quiñones,</i> 443 F.3d 134, 137 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Rodríguez Narváez,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> 895 F.2d at 43); <i>see also Díaz de Diana v. A.J.A.S.,</i> 10 P.R. Offic. Trans. 602, 608 n. 1, 1980 WL 138494 (1980). On the other hand, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has also stated that extrajudicial claims should be analyzed in [their] \"totality and in a liberal fashion,\" <i>Pitts v. United States,</i> 109 F.3d 832, 835 n. 4 (1st Cir.1997) (citing <i>Zambrana Maldonado v. Commonwealth,</i> 129 D.P.R. 740, 1992 WL 755000 (P.R. Jan. 30, 1992)). Also, consistent with a more liberal approach to tolling, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has remarked that it favors conservation of rights as \"the norm.\" <i>See </i><i>Kery v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,</i> 931 F.Supp. 947, 952 (D.P.R.1995); <i>Galib Frangie v. El Vocero de Puerto Rico,</i> 138 D.P.R. 560, 1995 WL 905884 (P.R. June 6, 1995) (\"The prescription of the right is the exception, being its exercise or conservation the norm, because of which the law propitiates the exercise and conservation of rights through the use of prescription's interruptive mechanisms.\").</p>\n<p>Despite this potentially contradictory guidance, however, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has not departed from the principle that an extrajudicial letter in order to toll the statute of limitations with respect to subsequent claims must give fair notice of the claims that are subsequently raised. It has explained the term \"extrajudicial claim\" as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Our Civil Code has not given to the word \"claim\" any precise or technical meaning. But this does not exempt us from trying to find it. In principle, a claim stands for demand or notice. That is: it is an act for which the holder of a subjective right, addresses the passive subject of said right, demanding that he adopt the required conduct. The claim is, then, a pretension in a technical sense.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Cintrón,</i> 27 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 592, 1990 WL 658719.</p>\n<p>Likewise, we have recognized this important principle in our case law, stating that \"[t]he identicality requirement prevents plaintiffs from circumventing the notice function of the statutes of limitations by asserting different claims in belated federal court complaints.\" <i>Municipality of Caguas,</i> 354 F.3d at 97.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Identicality and Plaintiffs' Supervisory Liability Claims</h2>\n<p>We first consider whether plaintiffs' extrajudicial claim letter is sufficiently identical to their subsequent complaint. As to the first identicality requirement, namely whether the same relief was sought, there is little question and, in fact, defendants concede,<sup>[4]</sup> that plaintiffs sought the same form of relief  money damages  both in the letter and in the subsequent complaint. That the letter requested a different amount in damages ($1,500,000) than the complaint (over $4,000,000) is not a problem here because the letter put Toledo on notice of a potential lawsuit for damages. <i>See id.</i> (\"Although the amount of damages differs in the two complaints, the allegation of damages in her state complaint gave the defendants the requisite `fair notice that [they] might be called upon to defend a damages suit ....'\") (quoting <i>Hernández del Valle v. Santa Aponte,</i> 575 F.2d 321, 324 (1st Cir.1978) (alteration in original)).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs, however, do not fare as well with respect to the second identicality requirement, namely whether the causes of action in the extrajudicial claim and subsequent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*116</span> complaint are based on the same substantive claims. As we have previously stated, Puerto Rico law requires sufficient detail \"to put defendant on notice of the general nature of their claims.\" <i>Id.</i> at 100. Here, we conclude that the extrajudicial letter did not assert a claim of supervisory liability in sufficient detail to meet the second prong of the identicality requirement. We explain.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' complaint asserted that the subordinate officers had a propensity of violence, that their supervisors knew of this propensity, and they did not act to correct it through retraining, psychological evaluation, or remedial action. As part of the allegation of the subordinate officers' propensity for violence, the complaint referred to \"incidents of unwarranted physical violence against citizens.\"<sup>[5]</sup> Although the extrajudicial letter was addressed to Superintendent Toledo and mentioned § 1983 in its penultimate sentence<sup>[6]</sup>  the letter failed to assert, even remotely, the factual allegations supporting supervisory liability that ultimately were raised in the complaint. Instead, the letter recounted plaintiffs' version of the events of June 8 and 9, alleging that the actions and/or omissions of the officers who perpetrated the violence against him caused damages and losses. Further, plaintiffs claimed that the arrest and filing of charges against Santana \"tarnished his reputation and violated his dignity\" because they were published in the newspapers and broadcast on the radio. Even if we took a \"liberal\" approach in assessing this second prong, analyzing the letter in its \"totality,\" we cannot conclude that Toledo, or any of the other defendant supervisors, would have been on sufficient notice to defend a supervisory liability claim.</p>\n<p>Thus, we conclude that because plaintiffs' extrajudicial letter fails to satisfy the second identicality requirement, the supervisory liability claim as to all defendant supervisors is time-barred.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Plaintiffs' Claims Against the On-Scene Officers</h2>\n<p>As to plaintiffs' claims against the on-scene officers, the extrajudicial letter states with \"precis[ion] and specific[ity],\" <i>see </i><i>Fernández,</i> 681 F.2d at 53, the allegations of Santana's arrest, beating, and incarceration without proper medical treatment. However, the letter was addressed only to Toledo and plaintiffs do not allege that the on-scene officers accused of perpetrating the attack knew about the letter or its contents. This is fatal to plaintiffs' claim. Puerto Rico law is clear that the extrajudicial letter \"must be addressed to the ... passive subject of the right, not to third party.\" <i>See Velilla v. Pueblo Supermarket,</i> 11 Offic. Trans. 732, 734-35 (1981); <i>see also </i><i>Pitts,</i> 109 F.3d at 835 (citing same principle); <i>Rodríguez-Narváez,</i> 895 F.2d at 44 (same). Plaintiffs have not pointed to any case, nor are we aware of one, where subordinate officers are held to be on constructive notice of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*117</span> claims made against them in an extrajudicial letter to a supervising officer.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs' claims as time-barred.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Santana received an official letter of termination on September 12, 2007.</p>\n<p>[2]  The letter stated that the claim is \"made under the protection of ... the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States of America, articles 1802 and 1803 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, 32 LPRA, secs 5141 and 5142 and the federal Civil Rights Law, 42 USC 1983.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  This order did not mention the illegal termination claim raised in the amended complaint.</p>\n<p>[4]  Defendants acknowledge that \"the letter does meet the first requirement regarding the same form of relief, since money damages are sought in both the extrajudicial claim letter and the complaint.\"</p>\n<p>[5]  In <i>Maldonado,</i> we noted that \"[s]ome recent language from the Supreme Court may call into question our prior circuit law on the standard for holding a public official liable for damages under § 1983 on a theory of supervisory liability.\" 568 F.3d at 275 n. 7 (citing <i>Iqbal,</i> 129 S.Ct. 1937). This concern is not implicated here because plaintiffs do not even allude to supervisory liability in their extrajudicial letter. Further, plaintiffs concede that they do not meet the <i>Iqbal</i> standard with respect to their supervisory liability claim in their complaint.</p>\n<p>[6]  Once again, the letter states that the claim is \"made under the protection of ... federal Civil Rights Law, 42 USC 1983.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  We need not reach the third identicality prong.</p>\n<p>[8]  Moreover, plaintiffs do not allege that the subordinate officers \"affirmatively induce[d] [plaintiffs] to address the extrajudicial claim to the wrong party,\" potentially excusing plaintiffs from the requirement to address the extrajudicial letter to the correct party. <i>Campos-Matos v. Evanstone Ins. Co.,</i> 208 F.Supp.2d 170, 173-74 (D.P.R.2002) (citing <i>Velilla</i> for this proposition of law).</p>\n<p>[9]  We also affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs' other claims, including their malicious prosecution and wrongful termination claims. First, malicious prosecution cannot be implicated on these facts against these defendants because, although they arrested Santana, the officers were not responsible for bringing charges against him. Second, plaintiffs have waived their wrongful termination claim by failing to sufficiently brief the argument in general (or, in specific, their \"continuous and uninterrupted violations\" theory with respect to this issue) on appeal. <i>See </i><i>Cashmere &amp; Camel Hair Mfrs.

Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, plaintiffs alleged violations of their constitutional rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth, Tenth, and Fourteenth Amendments as well as claims under Puerto Rico's constitution and civil law.</p>\n<p>In their complaint, plaintiffs specifically alleged that four PRPD officers illegally arrested, beat, and incarcerated Santana, causing him physical injuries, and causing him and his grandparents emotional distress.

In response, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The district court initially dismissed some of the claims, and upon a subsequent motion for reconsideration, it dismissed all remaining claims as time-barred. Plaintiffs appeal. After careful consideration, we affirm the district court's dismissal of plaintiff's complaint as untimely.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As this case comes to us as a motion to dismiss, \"`we must take all the factual allegations in the complaint as true.'\" <i>Maldonado v.

On June 8, 2006, while off-duty, he had dinner at a restaurant in Luquillo, Puerto Rico. While at dinner, his car was vandalized and his car radio stolen. Upon discovering the damage to his car, Santana met an individual on the street named Angel Cruz-García (\"Cruz\"), who informed Santana that he had seen two suspicious men in the area with a bag. Thinking they might have been the individuals who damaged the car, Santana and Cruz went to a housing project to look for the men Cruz had seen.</p>\n<p>When they could not find the two men Cruz suspected vandalized the car, Santana and Cruz left the housing project. They were then pulled over by Officers Jesús Sánchez-Zavala (\"Sánchez\") and Israel Candelaria-Vélez (\"Candelaria\"). A few minutes later, Officers Dionisio Molina-Padró (\"Molina\") and José Lebrón-Alicea (\"Lebrón\") also arrived at the scene. The four officers searched Santana's car and arrested him and Cruz for possession of crack cocaine. During the arrest, Sánchez and Molina allegedly hit Santana and handcuffed him tightly, causing Santana severe pain and several hematomas. The officers also humiliated Santana, calling him a corrupt officer and a junkie. The officers then brought Santana to the Luquillo Police Station where they kept him incarcerated for fifteen hours without food or medical attention.</p>\n<p>The following day, on June 9, 2006, Santana was taken to San Juan Superior Court and charged with possession of illegal drugs and driving without a vehicle registration plate. On July 21, 2006, Santana was suspended from the PRPD without pay. He never returned to work.<sup>[1]</sup> On February 7, 2007, in a preliminary hearing, a state court judge held that the PRPD officers who stopped Santana and searched his car lacked probable cause. The court dismissed the charges against Santana.</p>\n<p>On May 18, 2007, Santana and his grandparents sent a letter through their lawyer to PRPD Superintendent Toledo, who received the letter on May 21, 2007. The letter described the events of June 8 and 9, 2006, including Santana's arrest, beating, and incarceration by the four officers at the scene, who are all mentioned by name. It also noted that Santana was \"summarily expelled\" from his job \"as a result\" of the charges filed against him. The letter stated that \"[t]hese actions and/or omissions by the aforementioned agents caused damages and losses,\" including \"severe mental anguish\" to Santana's grandparents who had to witness \"the injustices committed against their grandson.\" The letter alleged that \"[t]he blows that [Santana] received, the filing of unfounded criminal charges against him, and the publication of all this in the news media, constitute a violation of his civil rights.\"<sup>[2]</sup> The letter then requested $1.5 million in damages \"as an indemnity for the damages and losses caused by the police officers referred to above.\"</p>\n<p>On September 7, 2007, Santana and his grandparents filed a complaint in federal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> court against the four officers who had been at the scene of the arrest and also against three supervising officers  Superintendent Toledo, José Ramos-González (\"Ramos\"), Commander of the Fajardo Region of the PRPD, and Nelson Torres-González (\"Torres\"), Commander of the Special Operations Unit of the PRPD. On November 21, 2007, the three supervising officers filed a motion to dismiss. On December 21, 2007, plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss and leave to file an amended complaint, which was granted by the district court. On January 4, 2008, plaintiffs filed the amended complaint, which again stated claims against the on-scene officers for violating Santana's civil rights and against the supervising officers for supervisory liability. It also included a claim alleging that Santana was fired as a result of his arrest and the charges brought against him, which constituted an illegal termination because the PRPD did not investigate the events of June 8 and 9, 2006 prior to terminating Santana. On April 4, 2008, Lebrón and Molina joined their co-defendants' earlier filed motion to dismiss. On May 7, 2008, Candelaria and Sánchez also joined the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>On or about May 12, 2008, the district court issued a partial dismissal of the complaint, dismissing the following claims: (1) all claims alleged against the supervising officers; (2) all claims brought under the First, Fifth, and Tenth Amendments; (3) all claims brought against the on-scene officers in their official capacities as police officers; and (4) all claims brought by Santana's grandparents pursuant to § 1983. This order left the claims against the on-scene officers in their personal capacities, pursuant to § 1983 for violations of Santana's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as all claims brought under Puerto Rico law against the on-scene officers.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Following the partial dismissal, both parties filed motions for reconsideration. The district court granted defendants' motion and issued an amended opinion and order, dismissing all of plaintiffs' remaining claims with prejudice as time-barred. Plaintiffs timely appeal. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the district court and hold that plaintiffs' extrajudicial letter did not toll the statute of limitations under Puerto Rico law, rendering his complaint untimely.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We first consider whether plaintiffs' complaint was properly time-barred. Defendants argue that plaintiffs filed the original complaint after the applicable statute of limitations had run. They further argue that the extrajudicial letter plaintiffs sent to Toledo failed to toll the limitations period. Defendants contend that the letter notified Toledo that he might be sued only in his official capacity as an employee of the PRPD, which is precluded by the Eleventh Amendment. We agree with defendants that the complaint was time-barred, albeit for different reasons.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Applicable Law Governing Statute of Limitations</h2>\n<p>We review <i>de novo</i> the district court's dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim based on statute of limitations grounds. <i>López-González v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span> (1985)). The parties agree that Puerto Rico's one-year prescriptive period governing tort actions is the statute of limitations applicable to plaintiffs' claims. <i>See id.</i> (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5298(2)). While we look to Puerto Rico law to determine the applicable prescriptive period, \"federal law determines the date on which the claim accrued.\" <i>Id.</i> at 96. The limitations period \"begins to run when the plaintiff `knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis for his claim.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 96-97 (quoting <i>Rodríguez Narváez v. Nazario,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536032\"><a href=\"/opinion/536032/alicia-rodriguez-narvaez-v-ariel-nazario-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 41 n. 5 (1st Cir.1990)). The \"limitations period of actions is a substantive, not a procedural, matter\" in Puerto Rico. <i>Rodríguez v. Suzuki Motor Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203879\"><a href=\"/opinion/203879/rodriguez-v-suzuki-motor-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span>, 406 (1st Cir.2009) (citing <i>García Pérez v.

June 30, 2008)). Thus, we apply Puerto Rico's tolling rules.</p>\n<p>Puerto Rico's tolling rules provide three ways that a plaintiff can interrupt the statute of limitations, which, as relevant here, include the sending of an \"extrajudicial\" letter. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5303. \"[A] letter sent by a tort plaintiff to the tortfeasor, complaining of the tortious conduct and demanding compensation, is an extrajudicial claim that, if timely, interrupts the prescription of the cause of action in tort.\" <i>Tokyo Marine &amp; Fire Ins. Co. v. Pérez y Cía.

Cir.1998). We note, however, that an extrajudicial letter will not toll the limitations \"period \"`for all claims arising out of the same facts.'\" <i>Municipality of Caguas,</i> 354 F.3d at 97 (quoting <i>Fernández v. Chardón,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405331\"><a href=\"/opinion/405331/rafael-rivera-fernandez-v-carlos-chardon-etc-juan-fumero-soto/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.1982)). The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has limited the tolling effect of an extrajudicial letter to situations where the letter is \"identical\" to a subsequently filed complaint. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Cintrón v. Estado Libre Asociado de P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic.

This identicality requirement has three components. First, the extrajudicial letter and subsequent complaint \"must seek the same form of relief.\" <i>Id.</i> at 98. Second, \"[t]he causes of action asserted [in the complaint] must be based on the same substantive claims\" as asserted in the extrajudicial letter. <i>Id.</i> Lastly, \"provided that other Puerto Rico tolling statutes do not rescue the claims on other grounds, they must be asserted against the same defendants in the same capacities; new defendants should not be added.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Before we proceed to our analysis as to whether the identicality requirement is met here, we note some tension in the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's approach to identicality and its tolling provisions. On the one hand, it has stated, and we have often repeated, that the \"tolling provisions [are] interpreted restrictively against the party invoking their protection.\" <i>Nieves-Vega v. Ortiz-Quiñones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202131\"><a href=\"/opinion/202131/nieves-vega-v-ortiz-quinones/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 137 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Rodríguez Narváez,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> 895 F.2d at 43); <i>see also Díaz de Diana v.

On the other hand, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has also stated that extrajudicial claims should be analyzed in [their] \"totality and in a liberal fashion,\" <i>Pitts v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197293\"><a href=\"/opinion/197293/pitts-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span></a></span>, 835 n. 4 (1st Cir.1997) (citing <i>Zambrana Maldonado v.

Jan. 30, 1992)). Also, consistent with a more liberal approach to tolling, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has remarked that it favors conservation of rights as \"the norm.\" <i>See </i><i>Kery v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2346597\"><a href=\"/opinion/2346597/kery-v-american-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

June 6, 1995) (\"The prescription of the right is the exception, being its exercise or conservation the norm, because of which the law propitiates the exercise and conservation of rights through the use of prescription's interruptive mechanisms.\").</p>\n<p>Despite this potentially contradictory guidance, however, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has not departed from the principle that an extrajudicial letter in order to toll the statute of limitations with respect to subsequent claims must give fair notice of the claims that are subsequently raised. It has explained the term \"extrajudicial claim\" as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Our Civil Code has not given to the word \"claim\" any precise or technical meaning. But this does not exempt us from trying to find it. In principle, a claim stands for demand or notice. That is: it is an act for which the holder of a subjective right, addresses the passive subject of said right, demanding that he adopt the required conduct. The claim is, then, a pretension in a technical sense.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Cintrón,</i> 27 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 592, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">658719</span></span>.</p>\n<p>Likewise, we have recognized this important principle in our case law, stating that \"[t]he identicality requirement prevents plaintiffs from circumventing the notice function of the statutes of limitations by asserting different claims in belated federal court complaints.\" <i>Municipality of Caguas,</i> 354 F.3d at 97.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Identicality and Plaintiffs' Supervisory Liability Claims</h2>\n<p>We first consider whether plaintiffs' extrajudicial claim letter is sufficiently identical to their subsequent complaint. As to the first identicality requirement, namely whether the same relief was sought, there is little question and, in fact, defendants concede,<sup>[4]</sup> that plaintiffs sought the same form of relief  money damages  both in the letter and in the subsequent complaint. That the letter requested a different amount in damages ($1,500,000) than the complaint (over $4,000,000) is not a problem here because the letter put Toledo on notice of a potential lawsuit for damages. <i>See id.</i> (\"Although the amount of damages differs in the two complaints, the allegation of damages in her state complaint gave the defendants the requisite `fair notice that [they] might be called upon to defend a damages suit ....'\") (quoting <i>Hernández del Valle v. Santa Aponte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"355492\"><a href=\"/opinion/355492/juan-hernandez-del-valle-v-jesus-santa-aponte-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>, 324 (1st Cir.1978) (alteration in original)).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs, however, do not fare as well with respect to the second identicality requirement, namely whether the causes of action in the extrajudicial claim and subsequent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*116</span> complaint are based on the same substantive claims. As we have previously stated, Puerto Rico law requires sufficient detail \"to put defendant on notice of the general nature of their claims.\" <i>Id.</i> at 100. Here, we conclude that the extrajudicial letter did not assert a claim of supervisory liability in sufficient detail to meet the second prong of the identicality requirement. We explain.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' complaint asserted that the subordinate officers had a propensity of violence, that their supervisors knew of this propensity, and they did not act to correct it through retraining, psychological evaluation, or remedial action. As part of the allegation of the subordinate officers' propensity for violence, the complaint referred to \"incidents of unwarranted physical violence against citizens.\"<sup>[5]</sup> Although the extrajudicial letter was addressed to Superintendent Toledo and mentioned § 1983 in its penultimate sentence<sup>[6]</sup>  the letter failed to assert, even remotely, the factual allegations supporting supervisory liability that ultimately were raised in the complaint. Instead, the letter recounted plaintiffs' version of the events of June 8 and 9, alleging that the actions and/or omissions of the officers who perpetrated the violence against him caused damages and losses. Further, plaintiffs claimed that the arrest and filing of charges against Santana \"tarnished his reputation and violated his dignity\" because they were published in the newspapers and broadcast on the radio. Even if we took a \"liberal\" approach in assessing this second prong, analyzing the letter in its \"totality,\" we cannot conclude that Toledo, or any of the other defendant supervisors, would have been on sufficient notice to defend a supervisory liability claim.</p>\n<p>Thus, we conclude that because plaintiffs' extrajudicial letter fails to satisfy the second identicality requirement, the supervisory liability claim as to all defendant supervisors is time-barred.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Plaintiffs' Claims Against the On-Scene Officers</h2>\n<p>As to plaintiffs' claims against the on-scene officers, the extrajudicial letter states with \"precis[ion] and specific[ity],\" <i>see </i><i>Fernández,</i> 681 F.2d at 53, the allegations of Santana's arrest, beating, and incarceration without proper medical treatment. However, the letter was addressed only to Toledo and plaintiffs do not allege that the on-scene officers accused of perpetrating the attack knew about the letter or its contents. This is fatal to plaintiffs' claim. Puerto Rico law is clear that the extrajudicial letter \"must be addressed to the ... passive subject of the right, not to third party.\" <i>See Velilla v. Pueblo Supermarket,</i> 11 Offic. Trans. 732, 734-35 (1981); <i>see also </i><i>Pitts,</i> 109 F.3d at 835 (citing same principle); <i>Rodríguez-Narváez,</i> 895 F.2d at 44 (same). Plaintiffs have not pointed to any case, nor are we aware of one, where subordinate officers are held to be on constructive notice of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*117</span> claims made against them in an extrajudicial letter to a supervising officer.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs' claims as time-barred.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Santana received an official letter of termination on September 12, 2007.</p>\n<p>[2]  The letter stated that the claim is \"made under the protection of ... the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States of America, articles 1802 and 1803 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, 32 LPRA, secs 5141 and 5142 and the federal Civil Rights Law, 42 USC 1983.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  This order did not mention the illegal termination claim raised in the amended complaint.</p>\n<p>[4]  Defendants acknowledge that \"the letter does meet the first requirement regarding the same form of relief, since money damages are sought in both the extrajudicial claim letter and the complaint.\"</p>\n<p>[5]  In <i>Maldonado,</i> we noted that \"[s]ome recent language from the Supreme Court may call into question our prior circuit law on the standard for holding a public official liable for damages under § 1983 on a theory of supervisory liability.\" 568 F.3d at 275 n. 7 (citing <i>Iqbal,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145875\"><a href=\"/opinion/145875/ashcroft-v-iqbal/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1937</span></a></span>). This concern is not implicated here because plaintiffs do not even allude to supervisory liability in their extrajudicial letter. Further, plaintiffs concede that they do not meet the <i>Iqbal</i> standard with respect to their supervisory liability claim in their complaint.</p>\n<p>[6]  Once again, the letter states that the claim is \"made under the protection of ... federal Civil Rights Law, 42 USC 1983.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  We need not reach the third identicality prong.</p>\n<p>[8]  Moreover, plaintiffs do not allege that the subordinate officers \"affirmatively induce[d] [plaintiffs] to address the extrajudicial claim to the wrong party,\" potentially excusing plaintiffs from the requirement to address the extrajudicial letter to the correct party. <i>Campos-Matos v. Evanstone Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2563211\"><a href=\"/opinion/2563211/campos-matos-v-evanstone-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span>, 173-74 (D.P.R.2002) (citing <i>Velilla</i> for this proposition of law).</p>\n<p>[9]  We also affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs' other claims, including their malicious prosecution and wrongful termination claims. First, malicious prosecution cannot be implicated on these facts against these defendants because, although they arrested Santana, the officers were not responsible for bringing charges against him. Second, plaintiffs have waived their wrongful termination claim by failing to sufficiently brief the argument in general (or, in specific, their \"continuous and uninterrupted violations\" theory with respect to this issue) on appeal. <i>See </i><i>Cashmere &amp; Camel Hair Mfrs. Inst. v. Saks Fifth Ave.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></span>, 309 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see </i><i>McCoy v.
