King L. Chan (\"Chan\") appeals from his\n\nabove-guidelines sentence on the grounds that (1) the court erred\n\nin applying a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(5);\n\n(2) the court imposed an unreasonably high sentence; (3) the court\n\nabused its discretion in requiring him to undergo mental health\n\ntreatment as a special condition of supervised release; (4) the\n\ncourt    erred    in      delegating      to   the      probation     officer      the\n\nresponsibility     to     determine      the   nature    of   the    mental   health\n\ntreatment required; and (5) the court erred in imposing a fine in\n\nthe written judgment.            We will consider those arguments in that\n\norder.\n\n           The short answer to Chan's objection to the four-level\n\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(5), for possession of a\n\nfirearm with intent to use it in another felony offense, is that he\n\nwaived that objection by first raising it as an objection to the\n\npresentence      report    and    then    affirmatively       withdrawing     it   at\n\nsentencing.      United States v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).\n\n           As to the reasonableness of the ultimate sentence, the\n\ndistrict court expressly considered, but reasonably rejected, each\n\nof the mitigating arguments advanced by Chan.                  First of all, the\n\ncourt rejected Chan's argument that he never intended to carry out\n\nthe conspiracy to rob the gun store but that the plans were merely\n\nthe story line for a book he intended to write.                     After reviewing\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fthe presentence report and hearing extended argument from both\n\nparties, the court concluded, based on the overt acts Chan had\n\ntaken to implement the plan--casing the location, training the\n\nparticipants, and purchasing and sawing off a shotgun--that, at the\n\ntime of his arrest, he intended to carry out the robbery.         However,\n\nthe court stopped short of finding that, when \"push came to shove,\"\n\nhe would actually do so.        On that, the court gave Chan \"the benefit\n\nof the doubt,\" stating that, otherwise, the sentence \"would be a\n\nlot higher.\"\n\n               The court also expressly considered the other mitigating\n\nfactors Chan advanced--that he had voluntarily enlisted in the\n\nMarines, that he has no prior criminal record, and that he comes\n\nfrom       a   \"very   good   family\"--but   found   those   considerations\n\noutweighed by the \"horrific\" nature of the offense that Chan had\n\nplanned.1       Given the \"very, very violent\" nature of those plans,\n\nthe court concluded that a sentence within the guidelines range of\n\n30 to 37 months would be too \"lenient,\" and that a slightly higher\n\nsentence of 42 months was necessary to address the statutory\n\nfactors, particularly the nature of the offense, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(a)(1). We find that explanation \"plausible,\" United States v.\n\nJiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc), and\n\n\n       1\n      According to the presentence report, which Chan ultimately\ndid not dispute, the plan to steal guns from a licensed firearms\ndealer included using a sawed-off shotgun, wrapping the storeowner\nin duct tape, and setting fire to the store with the owner still\ninside.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthe resulting sentence \"within reasonable limits,\" United States v.\n\nScherrer, 444 F.3d 91, 93 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).             Accordingly,\n\nwe defer to the district court's on-the-scene judgment.              Jiménez-\n\nBeltre, 440 F.3d at 519.\n\n            As a condition of supervised release, the court required\n\nthat Chan \"undergo a program of mental health counseling and\n\ntreatment   to   be   determined   by   the     probation     officer,   either\n\ninpatient   or   outpatient.\"      As     the   basis   for    imposing    that\n\ncondition, the court stated that \"there may be some psychological\n\nproblems here that may have contributed to the situation in which\n\nyou now find yourself and, if so, I think you can use the help in\n\ndealing with that problem so that it doesn't continue to plague you\n\nfor the rest of your life and you can turn your life around.\"\n\nAfter announcing that      condition and others, the court gave the\n\nparties an opportunity to raise \"[a]nything further,\" but defense\n\ncounsel raised no objections.\n\n            Even assuming that Chan did not thereby forfeit the\n\nobjections to the mental health treatment condition raised here,\n\nbut see United States v. Sepúlveda-Contreras, 2006 WL 3020263, at\n\n* 5 (1st Cir. Oct. 25, 2006); United States v. Mojica-Rivera, 435\n\nF.3d 28, 35 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 126 U.S. 1529 (2006), those\n\nobjections can be quickly dispatched.            The guidelines themselves\n\nrecommend such a condition \"[i]f the court has reason to believe\n\nthat the defendant is in need of psychological or psychiatric\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\ftreatment.\"      U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(d)(5).     And, given the gruesome and\n\ncompulsively detailed nature of Chan's plans, reflecting, as the\n\ngovernment argued, \"a fascination for violence,\" the district court\n\ndid not clearly err or abuse its discretion in determining that\n\nChan needed such treatment to rehabilitate himself and avoid future\n\ncrimes   of    this   nature.   Nor    did   the   district   court   err   in\n\ndelegating the determination of the precise form of treatment to\n\nthe probation officer.      See United States v. Allen, 312 F.3d 512,\n\n516 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n              Chan's challenge to the requirement that he pay the cost\n\nof his three years of supervised release, i.e., $10,358.28, is\n\ntwofold.      He argues, first, that this requirement was imposed, for\n\nthe first time, in the written judgment, and second, that it\n\nconflicts with the court's statement, at sentencing, that it was\n\n\"not going to impose any fine because . . . it doesn't appear [that\n\nChan] ha[s] any assets with which to pay a fine.\"\n\n              Taken in context, there is nothing inconsistent between\n\nthe oral sentence and the written judgment and nothing unreasonable\n\nabout the requirement that Chan pay the required amount.                    At\n\nsentencing, although the court characterized the requirement as a\n\ncondition of supervised release rather than a fine, the court\n\nexpressly stated that it would \"require . . . that [Chan] pay the\n\ncost of supervision.\"      Chan was on notice as to the amount of that\n\ncost, since it was stated in the presentence report.            In imposing\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthis requirement, the court recognized that Chan could not afford\n\nto pay the amount up front but stated that as a \"young able-bodied\n\nintelligent young man,\" Chan would be able to get a job when he is\n\nreleased and so could bear the cost of the supervised release at\n\nthat time. In further consideration of Chan's present inability to\n\npay or to earn sufficient money to do so while in prison, the court\n\nstayed the running of interest until Chan is released from prison.\n\nAgain, Chan's counsel voiced no objection to this requirement\n\nalthough given an opportunity to do so.      The written judgment is to\n\nthe same effect.\n\n          Whether   characterized   as   a   fine   or   a   condition   of\n\nsupervised release, we see no abuse of discretion in imposing this\n\nrequirement, see United States v. Uribe-Londoño, 409 F.3d 1, 4 (1st\n\nCir. 2005), much less anything so plainly erroneous as to warrant\n\ngranting relief on this forfeited ground, see United States v.\n\nYeje-Cabrera, 430 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir. 2005)              The guidelines\n\nthemselves recommend that the court \"impose a fine in all cases,\n\nexcept where the defendant establishes that he is . . . not likely\n\nto become able to pay any fine,\" U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2(a), and directs\n\nthe court to consider, in determining the amount of the fine, \"the\n\nexpected costs to the government of any . . . term of supervised\n\nrelease imposed,\" id., § 5E1.2(d)(7).           Given the guidelines'\n\nrecommended range of $6,000 to $60,000 for the present offense\n\nlevel of 19, id. § 5E1.1(c)(3), the amount imposed here was\n\n\n                                -6-\n\frelatively low. The statute and guideline applicable to supervised\n\nrelease further require that if a fine is imposed and has not been\n\npaid upon release, the defendant be required to pay the fine, in\n\ninstallments, as a condition of supervised release.        18 U.S.C. §\n\n3624(e);   U.S.S.G.   §   5D1.3(5).     Thus,   whether   we   view   the\n\nrequirement that Chan be required to pay the cost of his supervised\n\nrelease as a fine or as a condition of supervised release, we see\n\nno reason to overturn it.\n\n           Accordingly, the sentence is affirmed.     See 1st Cir. R.\n\n27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f",

Uribe-Londoño, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201592\"><a href=\"/opinion/201592/united-states-v-uribe-londono/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (1st\n\nCir. 2005), much less anything so plainly erroneous as to warrant\n\ngranting relief on this forfeited ground, see United States v.\n\nYeje-Cabrera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201905\"><a href=\"/opinion/201905/united-states-v-yeje-cabrera/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19 (1st Cir. 2005)              The guidelines\n\nthemselves recommend that the court \"impose a fine in all cases,\n\nexcept where the defendant establishes that he is . . . not likely\n\nto become able to pay any fine,\" U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2(a), and directs\n\nthe court to consider, in determining the amount of the fine, \"the\n\nexpected costs to the government of any . . . term of supervised\n\nrelease imposed,\" id., § 5E1.2(d)(7).           Given the guidelines'\n\nrecommended range of $6,000 to $60,000 for the present offense\n\nlevel of 19, id. § 5E1.1(c)(3), the amount imposed here was\n\n\n                                -6-\n\frelatively low. The statute and guideline applicable to supervised\n\nrelease further require that if a fine is imposed and has not been\n\npaid upon release, the defendant be required to pay the fine, in\n\ninstallments, as a condition of supervised release.        18 U.S.C. §\n\n3624(e);   U.S.S.G.   §   5D1.3(5).     Thus,   whether   we   view   the\n\nrequirement that Chan be required to pay the cost of his supervised\n\nrelease as a fine or as a condition of supervised release, we see\n\nno reason to overturn it.\n\n           Accordingly, the sentence is affirmed.     See 1st Cir. R.\n\n27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f</pre>",
