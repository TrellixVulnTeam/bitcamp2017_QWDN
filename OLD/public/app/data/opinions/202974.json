This appeal calls upon us\n\nto assess Maine's decision to allow small wineries to operate\n\npartially outside the usual strictures of the State's alcohol\n\ncontrol laws. The plaintiffs challenge this decision on the ground\n\nthat it constitutes impermissible favoritism in violation of the\n\ndormant commerce clause.         The district court found the challenge\n\nwanting.\n\n              While   the    central    principles    on   which   the   dormant\n\ncommerce clause operates are well-developed, gray areas exist\n\naround the edges.           We believe that Maine's exception for small\n\nwineries falls within one of these gray areas — and in those\n\nprecincts, courts must proceed case by case.               Here, after careful\n\nperscrutation of Maine's statutory scheme and its constitutional\n\nimplications, we find no substantial evidence that the exception\n\nfor   small    wineries      actually   discriminates      against   interstate\n\ncommerce.      Consequently, we affirm the judgment of the district\n\ncourt.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n              This case has been submitted on a stipulated record.\n\nThose stipulations limn the statutory scheme by means of which\n\nMaine regulates the sale of wine.             To any extent that the statutes\n\nthemselves are ambiguous, we assume that they operate and are\n\nenforced in the manner agreed upon by the parties.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f                           A.   The Statutory Scheme.\n\n             As a general matter Maine, like many states, has chosen\n\nto regulate the distribution of alcoholic beverages by requiring\n\nthat producers sell exclusively to licensed wholesalers who, in\n\nturn, may sell only to licensed retailers.            Consumers may purchase\n\nalcoholic beverages for off-premises consumption only from licensed\n\nretailers and may do so only in face-to-face transactions.                This\n\nthree-tiered system has been justified on multiple grounds: as an\n\nefficient    means    of    controlling    the   distribution   of    alcoholic\n\nbeverages, as an effective means of promoting temperance, and as a\n\nfacilitating means of collecting excise taxes.              See, e.g., North\n\nDakota v. United States, 495 U.S. 423, 432 (1990) (recognizing\n\nthese as legitimate grounds); Wine & Spirits Retailers, Inc. v.\n\nRhode Island, 481 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 2007) (recognizing promotion\n\nof temperance and control of alcohol distribution as legitimate\n\nlegislative purposes).          Its legitimacy has been vouchsafed by no\n\nless an authority than the Supreme Court.             See Granholm v. Heald,\n\n544 U.S. 460, 466 (2005); North Dakota, 495 U.S. at 432.\n\n             Consistent with this three-tiered system, Maine wineries\n\nmay,   for   the    most    part,   sell   their   wares   in-state    only   to\n\nwholesalers.       See Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 28-A, § 1361.        But this edict\n\nadmits of an exception for small vintners that obtain special \"farm\n\nwinery\" licenses.      See id. § 1355(3).        To qualify for a farm winery\n\nlicense, a vineyard must produce no more than 50,000 gallons of\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fwine annually, see id. § 1355(3)(A), and must pay a modest license\n\nfee ($50 per year), see id. § 1551(3)(F).           There are no geographic\n\nrestrictions     applicable     to   farm    wineries,     and    licenses       are\n\navailable on the same terms to wineries located throughout the\n\nUnited States.      Despite this equal footing, no winery outside of\n\nMaine has yet applied for a farm winery license.\n\n            Farm wineries enjoy a number of special prerogatives.\n\nFor one thing, they may bypass wholesalers and sell directly to\n\nretailers and restaurants.        Id. § 1355(3)(D).        For another thing,\n\nthey may sell directly to consumers; provided, however, that the\n\ntransactions take place on the winery's premises or at one of up to\n\ntwo   off-site   locations      established    by    the   winery.         Id.    §\n\n1355(3)(B)-(C). Out-of-state wineries may establish off-site sales\n\noutlets on the same basis as in-state wineries.\n\n            Sales   made   by   farm   wineries     directly     to    consumers,\n\nwherever consummated, must be face to face.              Id.     This means, of\n\ncourse, that wine cannot be direct-shipped from a winery to a\n\nconsumer.    Indeed, Maine law expressly forbids the furnishing of\n\nalcoholic beverages via mail order services, see id. § 2077-B, and\n\nfarm wineries are not exempt from that prohibition.                   Were a non-\n\nMaine winery to obtain a farm winery license, it too would be\n\nsubject to this prohibition and could sell its products to Maine\n\nconsumers only on the winery's premises or at a designated off-site\n\nlocation.\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f          An additional provision of the statutory regime impinges\n\nindirectly upon the ability of out-of-state wineries to sell\n\ndirectly to Maine consumers.     See id. § 2077.     That provision\n\nprohibits a Maine resident from bringing more than four quarts of\n\nwine (typically five bottles) into the state. Id. Individuals may\n\nobtain relief from this import limitation only by special request.\n\nId. § 2073(3)(A).   Such requests are evaluated on a case-by-case\n\nbasis by a state agency. Id.     The parties have stipulated that,\n\nwhen requested, such permission is \"generally granted.\"      In the\n\nabsence of such a dispensation, a Maine resident visiting an out-\n\nof-state winery and purchasing wine in person would be statutorily\n\nforbidden from bringing more than four quarts home with her, and\n\nthe winery would be statutorily forbidden from shipping purchased\n\nwine to consumers in Maine.\n\n                      B.   Travel of the Case.\n\n          We turn now from the statutory scheme to the particulars\n\nof this case.   On September 27, 2005, two plaintiffs — Dr. Philip\n\nBrooks, a Maine resident and oenophile, and Cherry Hill Vineyard,\n\nLLC, an Oregon winery that produces fewer than 50,000 gallons of\n\nwine a year — filed a civil action in Maine's federal district\n\ncourt against a number of state hierarchs.1      In their complaint,\n\n\n     1\n      The defendants, all of whom are sued in their official\ncapacities, are the governor, the attorney general, and the two\nranking officers of Maine's Bureau of Liquor Enforcement.        We\nsometimes refer to the defendants, collectively, as \"Maine\" or \"the\nState.\"\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthey alleged that Maine's farm winery program, in conjunction with\n\nthe     prohibition          on     direct     shipping,     has     the     effect   of\n\ndiscriminating against interstate commerce in violation of the\n\ndormant commerce clause.2               They prayed for a declaration that the\n\nstatutory scheme is unconstitutional insofar as it prevents out-of-\n\nstate wineries from selling their merchandise directly to Maine\n\nconsumers.           Relatedly,      they     sought    injunctive    relief    barring\n\nenforcement of sections 1361(4), 2077, and 2077-B against wineries\n\nthat       choose    to    sell    or   ship    their    wares    directly    to   Maine\n\nconsumers.\n\n               The    State        defended     the    face-to-face      transactional\n\nrequirement and the related restriction on direct shipping as\n\nnecessary to prevent underage persons from gaining access to\n\nalcoholic beverages.                Wholesalers and retailers have a vested\n\ninterest in the three-tiered system and, by leave of court, a trade\n\ngroup — the Maine Beer and Wine Wholesalers Association — appeared\n\nas an amicus curiae in support of the statutory scheme.\n\n               The parties compiled a stipulated record and cross-moved\n\nfor summary judgment.              The district court referred the motions to\n\na     magistrate          judge,    who      concluded     that    the     face-to-face\n\n\n       2\n      We think it noteworthy that the plaintiffs have not\nchallenged the importation limit, see Appellants' Br. at 15 n.18,\nbut, rather, treat it as aggravating the unconstitutional\ndiscrimination of which they complain. Because the plaintiffs have\nchosen to focus their challenge on the farm winery exception and\nthe face-to-face sales requirement, we eschew any particularized\nanalysis of the constitutionality of the importation limit.\n\n                                               -7-\n\ftransactional requirement and the related ban on direct shipping,\n\nas memorialized in Maine's statutory scheme, did not discriminate\n\nagainst interstate commerce but, instead, comprised a reasonable\n\nexercise in regulation designed to forestall the sale of alcoholic\n\nbeverages to minors.   Cherry Hill Vineyard, LLC v. Baldacci, Civ.\n\nNo. 05-153, 2006 WL 2121192, at *8-9 (D. Me. July 27, 2006).   The\n\ndistrict court summarily adopted the magistrate judge's recommended\n\ndecision and granted summary judgment for the defendants.   Cherry\n\nHill Vineyard, LLC v. Baldacci, Civ. No. 05-153 (D. Me. Mar. 5,\n\n2007) (unpublished).   This timely appeal followed.\n\n          We note, with appreciation, that five separate sets of\n\namici have filed helpful briefs (all of them urging affirmance of\n\nthe judgment below).   There is an interesting wrinkle concerning\n\nthe arguments advanced by the amici.   The plaintiffs, citing our\n\ndecisions in United States v. Sturm, Ruger & Co., 84 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\n\nCir. 1996), and Rhode Island v. Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d\n\n685, 705 n.22 (1st Cir. 1994), argue that amici cannot raise new\n\narguments.   In both of the cited cases, however, amici wished to\n\nadvance novel arguments on behalf of appellants.   Here, the amici\n\nhave appeared in support of the appellees.   Given our settled rule\n\nthat an appellate court may affirm the entry of summary judgment on\n\nany ground made manifest by the record, see, e.g., Iverson v. City\n\nof Boston, 452 F.3d 94, 98 (1st Cir. 2006), this is quite probably\n\na material difference.    In any event, the point is of mainly\n\n\n                                -8-\n\facademic interest, as we affirm on the basis of a line of argument\n\nconsistently propounded by the State.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n               Because the district court acted under the aegis of\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, our review is de novo.                See\n\nAuburn Police Union v. Carpenter, 8 F.3d 886, 892 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nHere, our de novo review begins with first principles.                     The\n\nConstitution grants Congress the power to \"regulate Commerce . . .\n\namong the several States.\"       U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3.          This\n\naffirmative grant of power to the federal sovereign has long been\n\nunderstood, by necessary implication, to strip state governments of\n\nany authority to impede the flow of goods between states.                  See\n\nAlliance of Auto. Mfrs. v. Gwadosky, 430 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n           The doctrine that surrounds this principle, sometimes\n\nreferred to as the dormant commerce clause, holds that a state\n\nregulation that discriminates against interstate commerce on its\n\nface, in purpose, or in effect is highly suspect and will be\n\nsustained only when it promotes a legitimate state interest that\n\ncannot   be    achieved   through    any   reasonable    nondiscriminatory\n\nalternative.      Id.     Laws   that   regulate   evenhandedly     and   only\n\nincidentally     burden   commerce   are   subjected    to   less   searching\n\nscrutiny under a balancing test, which operates to validate a\n\nchallenged regulation unless it burdens commerce in a way that is\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f\"clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits\" to\n\nbe derived therefrom.       Wine & Spirits Retailers, 481 F.3d at 11\n\n(citing Pike v. Bruce Church, 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970)).\n\n                    A.   The Plaintiffs' Argument.\n\n           This is a rifle-shot appeal.             The plaintiffs do not\n\nadvance any argument under the Pike balancing test.              They must,\n\ntherefore, avail themselves of the strict scrutiny reserved for\n\nstatutes that frankly discriminate against interstate commerce.\n\nEven within that taxonomy, the plaintiffs' objection is narrow;\n\nthey forgo any argument that the challenged portions of Maine's\n\nstatutory scheme are discriminatory either on their face or in\n\ntheir conceived purpose.\n\n           Winnowing out these possibilities, the plaintiffs pin\n\ntheir hopes on the isthmian claim that the challenged portions of\n\nthe Maine regime are discriminatory in effect, that is, that by\n\nallowing   direct    sales    to    consumers       only   in   face-to-face\n\ntransactions, the statutory scheme has the practical effect of\n\nbenefitting Maine wineries at the expense of their out-of-state\n\ncompetitors.    In advancing this argument, the plaintiffs remind us\n\nthat, for this purpose, discrimination has been broadly defined as\n\n\"differential   treatment    of    in-state   and    out-of-state   economic\n\ninterests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.\"              Or.\n\nWaste Sys. v. Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 511 U.S. 93, 99 (1994).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f              Challenges of this type have a theoretical basis in the\n\ncase    law.        Even      facially      neutral     laws     enacted    without\n\ndiscriminatory      motive     and   in     furtherance    of    legitimate      local\n\nobjectives may be discriminatory in effect (and, thus, engender\n\nstrict scrutiny under the jurisprudence of the dormant commerce\n\nclause).      See, e.g., Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Comm'n, 432\n\nU.S. 333, 352-53 (1977); Trailer Marine Transp. Corp. v. Rivera\n\nVazquez, 977 F.2d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n              When such a challenge is mounted, the initial burden of\n\nestablishing discrimination rests with the challenger.                    See Hughes\n\nv. Oklahoma, 441 U.S. 322, 336 (1979).                  Once discrimination is\n\nestablished, however, the devoir of persuasion shifts and the\n\naffected       state       must      demonstrate        that      no      reasonable\n\nnondiscriminatory regulation could achieve its objectives. See New\n\nEnergy Co. v. Limbach, 486 U.S. 269, 278 (1988).\n\n              With this background in place, we frame the issue.                  The\n\nplaintiffs argue that the requirement that direct sales take place\n\non winery premises effectively prevents out-of-state wineries, many\n\nof    which   are   geographically         distant,   from     enjoying    any   real\n\nopportunity of selling directly to consumers.                   In-state wineries,\n\nthe    plaintiffs      say,   are    not    similarly     disadvantaged     because\n\nconsumers can much more readily travel to their premises.                    So, the\n\nplaintiffs' thesis runs, the regime's effect is to raise the cost\n\nof, say, west coast wines as compared to Maine wines since the\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\fformer will, as a practical matter, be available to consumers only\n\nafter the addition of hefty \"middleman\" mark-ups.3                 See generally\n\nGranholm, 544 U.S. at 474 (calling the retailer and wholesaler \"two\n\nextra layers of overhead\" that \"increase . . . cost\").                   Moreover,\n\nwines produced by small out-of-state wineries that are unable to\n\nattract   the     attention   of    a    retailer        or   wholesaler    may    be\n\nunavailable in Maine altogether.          Indeed, the plaintiffs argue, in\n\norder to reach Maine consumers for face-to-face transactions, out-\n\nof-state wineries would necessarily be burdened with opening off-\n\nsite locations within the Maine market.              Establishing that kind of\n\npresence would further escalate costs.4\n\n            The    plaintiffs       conclude        by    asserting      that     the\n\ndiscriminatory burden imposed by the face-to-face sales requirement\n\nand the related ban on direct shipping cannot be justified as\n\nnecessary to any legitimate governmental interest.                    They insist\n\nthat the State can fulfill its goal of restricting access to\n\nalcoholic   beverages    on   the    part      of   underage    youths     by,    say,\n\n\n     3\n      In mounting this argument, the plaintiffs attempt to\ndistinguish between the cost attributable to the statutory\nrequirements and any added expense that is attributable to\ngeographic reality (for example, the fact that Oregon wine must be\nshipped cross-country in order to reach Maine consumers will\ninevitably add to its cost).\n     4\n      Although the plaintiffs do not challenge Maine's four-quart\nimportation limit, see supra note 2, they complain that their\ndisadvantage is compounded by that limit.       In practice, the\nimportation limit prevents even committed wine collectors who are\nwilling to travel from bringing home enough wine to justify the\njourney.\n\n                                        -12-\n\fmandating   that    carriers      delivering    wine      to   direct   purchasers\n\nconfirm that recipients are at least twenty-one years of age. See,\n\ne.g., Mich. Comp. Laws § 436.1203 (taking this approach).                  On this\n\nbasis, the plaintiffs asseverate that the face-to-face requirement\n\nand the related ban on direct shipping cannot withstand strict\n\nscrutiny.\n\n                             B.    The Rejoinder.\n\n            Although    vigorously     asserted      by    able   counsel,     this\n\nargument lacks force.        When all is said and done, the plaintiffs\n\nhave not satisfied their initial burden of showing that Maine's\n\nstatutory   scheme     is   discriminatory      in   effect.       Without     such\n\nevidence, we must defer to the state legislature, which \"has\n\n'virtually complete control' over the importation and sale of\n\nliquor and the structure of the liquor distribution system.\" North\n\nDakota, 495 U.S. at 431 (quoting Cal. Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n\n\nv. Midcal Alum., Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 110 (1980)).\n\n            To be sure, the plaintiffs cite a plethora of cases in\n\nendeavoring    to    demonstrate      that     the   expense      added   by    the\n\nrestriction on direct shipment offends the dormant commerce clause.\n\nBut these decisions are not capable of carrying the weight that the\n\nplaintiffs load upon them.\n\n            The plaintiffs' most loudly bruited authority is Granholm,\n\nin which the Supreme Court invalidated Michigan and New York\n\nrestrictions on the direct shipping of alcohol by out-of-state\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fwineries.    Despite some superficial similarities, the fit between\n\nGranholm and this case is not exact and, thus, the decision is of\n\nlimited utility here.5 The novel aspect of Granholm was the Court's\n\nholding that the Twenty-First Amendment — a constitutional provision\n\ndealing with the regulatory power of the several states in regard\n\nto the manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages\n\n— cannot salvage explicitly discriminatory regimes even though the\n\nregulated product is an alcoholic beverage.   See Granholm, 544 U.S.\n\nat 493.     The Twenty-First Amendment is only peripherally involved\n\nin this case, and does not require discussion.   On the issue before\n\nus, Granholm does not dictate the result.     That opinion provides\n\nless than complete guidance, and virtually no new elaboration, with\n\nrespect to what does — or does not — constitute discrimination\n\nagainst interstate commerce.\n\n            Both the Michigan and New York schemes invalidated in\n\nGranholm discriminated against out-of-state purveyors — and did so\n\nin ways that long have been understood to be unconstitutional.   See\n\nid. at 467 (terming the discrimination \"explicit\"); see also id. at\n\n472-76.     The Michigan scheme was discriminatory on its face — it\n\nallowed in-state producers to ship wines directly to Michigan\n\n\n     5\n      The Granholm Court did express skepticism as to whether a ban\non direct shipping furthers the goal of limiting the access of\nunderage youths to alcohol. See 544 U.S. at 490. Thus, were the\nplaintiffs able to carry their initial burden of putting forth\nsubstantial evidence showing an impermissibly discriminatory\neffect, Granholm might have more impact on other elements within\nthe decisional calculus.\n\n                                 -14-\n\fconsumers while banning out-of-state producers from doing so.             See\n\nid. at 473-74.     Thus, the finding of unconstitutionality does not\n\nassist the present plaintiffs.\n\n            The New York scheme was closer, but still different; it\n\nallowed wineries to direct-ship only if they first established a\n\nphysical presence in New York.        See id. at 474.      The scheme was\n\nfound to \"allow in-state wineries to sell wine directly to consumers\n\nin that State but to prohibit out-of-state wineries from doing so,\n\nor, at the least, to make direct sales impractical from an economic\n\nstandpoint.\"      Id. at 466.     The plaintiffs insist that the Maine\n\nscheme operates much the same as the New York scheme because, in\n\npractical effect, it gives in-state producers preferential access\n\nto   consumers.     While   one   district   court,   drawing   heavily   on\n\nGranholm, has found discriminatory a requirement that direct wine\n\nsales be made face to face, see Cherry Hill Vineyard, LLC v.\n\nHudgins, 488 F. Supp. 2d 601, 618-19 (W.D. Ky. 2006), other courts\n\ndisagree, see, e.g., Baude v. Heath, Civ. No. 05-0735, ___ F. Supp.\n\n2d ___, ___ n.25 (S.D. Ind. Aug. 29, 2007) [2007 WL 2479587, at *16\n\nn.25]; Jelovsek v. Bresden, 482 F. Supp. 2d 1013, 1020-21 (E.D.\n\nTenn. 2007); Hurley v. Minner, Civ. No. 05-826, 2006 WL 2789164, at\n\n*6 (D. Del. Sept. 26, 2006).\n\n            We concur with the latter courts.     The plaintiffs in this\n\ncase overlook a key distinction between the New York and Maine\n\nstatutes.    New York created an additional barrier to the entry of\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fout-of-state wineries into the direct-shipping market — a barrier\n\nthat Maine has not erected.      To elaborate, New York created a\n\ndirect-shipping market for wine; it allowed direct shipping on\n\nparticular conditions, and those conditions were rigged to favor in-\n\nstate wineries (which, unlike out-of-state wineries, would not have\n\nto set up separate sales outlets within New York's boundaries). See\n\nGranholm, 544 U.S. at 474.   Maine flatly outlaws any and all direct\n\nshipping of wine. Consequently, there is no direct-shipping market;\n\nneither in-state nor out-of-state wineries may direct-ship.   Hence,\n\nwhile well-established legal rules demanded the invalidation of both\n\nthe Michigan and New York schemes, see, e.g., Or. Waste Sys., 511\n\nU.S. at 99-100, those rules do not demand any such ukase here.\n\n            By the same token, most of the other cases chronicled by\n\nthe plaintiffs involve statutes that — unlike the Maine regime at\n\nissue here — explicitly discriminate against out-of-state goods or\n\nproducts.    See, e.g., id. at 99; Chem. Waste Mgmt., Inc. v. Hunt,\n\n504 U.S. 334, 342 (1992); City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437\n\nU.S. 617, 627 (1978).      These cases are distinguishable because\n\nMaine's statutory scheme vis-à-vis farm wineries does not explicitly\n\ndiscriminate against interstate commerce. Farm winery licenses are\n\navailable on equal terms to in-state and out-of-state vineyards\n\nalike, and Maine's ban on the direct shipping of wine applies\n\nevenhandedly across the board.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f           We are, then, on terra incognita.    In the absence of any\n\nexplicit (i.e., facial) discrimination, the plaintiffs must persuade\n\nus that Maine's evenhanded requirement that all wine purchases be\n\nmade face to face camouflages some more sinister reality: that its\n\npractical effect is invidiously discriminatory.       This is a burden\n\nthat litigants in analogous cases ordinarily have failed to carry.\n\nSee, e.g., Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Pataki, 320 F.3d 200,\n\n212-14 (2d Cir. 2003) (upholding, as against a dormant commerce\n\nclause challenge, state law requiring that all tobacco sales be\n\nconducted in face-to-face transactions).\n\n           The Supreme Court has not directly spoken to the question\n\nof what showing is required to prove discriminatory effect where,\n\nas here, a statute is evenhanded on its face and wholesome in its\n\npurpose.   In our view, that showing must be substantial — and an\n\nexamination of the evidence in the record satisfies us that the\n\nplaintiffs have not pushed past this plateau.       We explain briefly.\n\n           We previously have held that a plaintiff bringing a\n\ndormant commerce clause challenge based exclusively on the allegedly\n\ndiscriminatory effect of a statutory scheme is required to submit\n\nsome probative evidence of adverse impact.      See Alliance of Auto.\n\nMfrs., 430 F.3d at 41 (upholding summary judgment when plaintiff\n\n\"offered only prognostications woven from the gossamer strands of\n\nspeculation   and   surmise,   unaccompanied   by   any   significantly\n\nprobative evidence\" of a discriminatory effect on commerce); accord\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fR & M Oil & Supply, Inc. v. Saunders, 307 F.3d 731, 735 (8th Cir.\n\n2002) (holding that plaintiff had failed to provide sufficient\n\nevidence to prove discriminatory effect); E. Ky. Res. v. Fiscal Ct.\n\nof Magoffin County, 127 F.3d 532, 544 (6th Cir. 1997) (finding no\n\ndiscriminatory effect when plaintiffs failed to present evidence\n\nshowing how out-of-state entities, as compared to in-state entities,\n\nwere burdened).\n\n          Sweeping aside rhetorical flourishes, the plaintiffs have\n\nproffered no evidence that permitting farm wineries to sell only\n\nface to face, either on premises or at approved in-state locations,\n\ndiscriminates against interstate commerce.    There is no evidence\n\nthat Maine law acts to protect Maine vineyards or that Maine\n\nconsumers substitute wines purchased directly from Maine vineyards\n\nfor wines that they otherwise would have purchased from out-of-state\n\nproducers.   There is not even evidence that any wines at all are\n\npurchased by consumers directly from Maine vineyards. And, finally,\n\nnothing contained in the stipulated record suggests that the locus\n\noption somehow alters the competitive balance between in-state and\n\nout-of-state firms.    Cf. Hunt, 432 U.S. at 351 (holding that\n\nstatutory scheme designed to eliminate out-of-state companies'\n\ncompetitive advantage in marketing created an unconstitutionally\n\ndiscriminatory effect).\n\n          The substitution scenario is further weakened by the fact\n\nthat the plaintiffs have adduced no evidence that would in any way\n\n\n                               -18-\n\fundermine the plausible impression that Maine consumers (like\n\nimbibers everywhere) view trips to a winery as a distinct experience\n\nincommensurate with — and, therefore, unlikely to be replaced by —\n\na trip to either a mailbox or a retail liquor store.         See Jelovsek,\n\n482 F. Supp. 2d at 1021 (observing that \"it seems the market for on-\n\nsite wine purchases, requiring the effort (or pleasure) of a trip\n\nto the winery, is different in kind and reach from the convenience-\n\noriented market that would be created and facilitated by a law\n\nallowing direct-shipping\").6     Nor have they offered evidence to\n\nimpeach the suggestion, made in one of the cases on which they rely,\n\nthat bottles of wine are unique and, thus, unlikely to be perceived\n\nby consumers as interchangeable.      See Hudgins, 488 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n617; see also Gen. Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 299 (1997)\n\n(observing   that   \"difference[s]   in   products   may    mean    that    the\n\ndifferent entities serve different markets, and would continue to\n\ndo so even if the supposedly discriminatory burden were removed\").\n\n          The   plaintiffs'   principal    effort    to    fill    this    void\n\ninvolves a report prepared by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\nDrawing on this report, they argue that the ban on direct shipping\n\nraises the cost of out-of-state wines and prices some wines out of\n\n\n\n     6\n      The plaintiffs question the discussion in Jelovsek, presently\npending on appeal before the Sixth Circuit, on the ground that the\ncase was decided on the pleadings.      Whatever the situation in\nJelovsek, the plaintiffs here had ample opportunity to flesh out\nthe record, yet they still have not been able to furnish probative\nevidence of discriminatory effect.\n\n                                 -19-\n\fthe Maine market altogether. FTC, Possible Anticompetitive Barriers\n\nto   E-Commerce:      Wine   (July   2003)    [FTC    Report],       available   at\n\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/07/winereport2.pdf (last visited Sept.\n\n20, 2007).    But nothing in the FTC Report establishes that the farm\n\nwinery exception disproportionately burdens interstate commerce.\n\n             The plaintiffs also repeatedly cite Associated Indus. of\n\nMo. v. Lohman, 511 U.S. 641 (1994), for the proposition that\n\ndiscrimination should be measured in dollars and cents, such as in\n\nlost sales.      See id. at 654.          Even if that is so, however, the\n\nplaintiffs have not shown a single penny of losses attributable to\n\nthe allegedly discriminatory farm winery exception.                  They invite us\n\nto infer the existence of such losses but prudence requires that we\n\ndecline that invitation.         In our judgment, the mere fact that a\n\nstatutory regime has a discriminatory potential is not enough to\n\ntrigger strict scrutiny under the dormant commerce clause.                 See id.\n\n(noting   that    the   Justices     \"have   never     deemed    a    hypothetical\n\npossibility      of   favoritism     to    constitute    discrimination       that\n\ntransgresses constitutional commands\").              There must be substantial\n\nevidence of an actual discriminatory effect, and such evidence is\n\nutterly absent here.7          Given Maine's large land mass and the\n\n\n      7\n      Cherry Hill's complaint that it will be forced to establish\noff-site locations geographically closer to Maine consumers in\norder to attract Maine business appears in some sense to be a\ncomplaint about the effects of geography.         Distance is not\ncongruent with state lines, and the effects of geography alone do\nnot constitute impermissible discrimination.     An effect is not\ndiscriminatory, in violation of the dormant commerce clause, if it\n\n                                      -20-\n\fconcentration of its population in the southern end of the state,\n\nsee Grant's Dairy — Me., LLC v. Comm'r of Me. Dep't of Agric., Food\n\n& Rural Res., 232 F.3d 8, 21 (1st Cir. 2000), it cannot plausibly\n\nbe said that the farm winery exception redounds to the exclusive\n\nbenefit of Maine vineyards. Rather, whatever minimal benefits might\n\nbe inferred from the structure of the scheme itself seem largely to\n\nbe dispersed on the basis of geography.\n\n             In short, there is simply no evidence that out-of-state\n\nwineries suffer any disproportionate loss of business on account of\n\nMaine's direct-shipping ban. The plaintiffs have made no showing\n\nthat   any   discrimination   vis-à-vis     access   to   the   Maine   market\n\nactually results from the farm winery exception itself.            While the\n\nFTC Report and the plaintiffs' other evidentiary proffers suggest\n\nthat   a   direct-shipping    ban   harms   out-of-state    producers,     the\n\nplaintiffs acknowledge that the \"constricted availability of wine\n\nis due in large part to the three-tier system itself.\"           Appellants'\n\nBr. at 10.    Because the three-tiered system has not been challenged\n\nhere, this acknowledgment undercuts any inference that the allegedly\n\n\n\n\nresults from natural conditions.     See Doran v. Mass. Turnpike\nAuth., 348 F.3d 315, 319 (1st Cir. 2003); Grant's Dairy — Me., LLC\nv. Comm'r of Me. Dep't of Agric., Food & Rural Res., 232 F.3d 8, 21\n(1st Cir. 2000); see also Baude, Civ. No. 05-0735, at *27-28.\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fdiscriminatory     farm   winery   exception     is   responsible   for   the\n\nperceived harm.8\n\n           The plaintiffs' response to this lack of evidence is an\n\nassertion that even if \"the impact is small because direct sales do\n\nnot constitute a significant market and . . . in-state wineries do\n\nnot   do   much    walk-in   business,\"    the    regime    is   nonetheless\n\nunconstitutional because the dormant commerce clause contains no de\n\nminimis exception.     Appellants' Reply Br. at 8.         But the case upon\n\nwhich they rely for this proposition, Camps Newfound/Owatonna v.\n\nTown of Harrison, 520 U.S. 564 (1967), concerned a statute that was\n\ndiscriminatory on its face.         See id. at 581. It strikes us as\n\nimplausible that the same de minimis standard would apply when\n\nevaluating whether a facially neutral statute has a discriminatory\n\neffect on interstate commerce.      See Brown & Williamson Tobacco, 320\n\nF.3d at 216 (finding a \"de minimis advantage to in-state [companies]\n\n. . . insufficient to establish a discriminatory effect\"); cf. New\n\nEnergy, 486 U.S. at 276 (commenting that \"where discrimination is\n\npatent . . . neither a widespread advantage to in-state interests\n\n\n      8\n      To be sure, Granholm may reflect a retrenchment of the broad\nstate power over the distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages\nthat characterized earlier Supreme Court jurisprudence.      But it\ndoes not appear, on the basis of Granholm alone, that a challenge\ncan successfully be mounted to the three-tiered system.         See\nGranholm, 544 U.S. at 466 (reaffirming that \"States can mandate a\nthree-tier distribution scheme in the exercise of their authority\nunder the Twenty-first Amendment\"); id. at 493 (\"If a State chooses\nto allow direct shipment of wine, it must do so on evenhanded\nterms.\"); see also U.S. Const. amend. XXI. Any further step away\nfrom such a scheme is for the Supreme Court to take.\n\n                                    -22-\n\fnor a widespread disadvantage to out-of-state competitors need be\n\nshown\") (emphasis supplied).\n\n           The de minimis standard, when used in cases involving\n\nfacially   discriminatory    laws,     speaks   to    the   degree   of\n\ndiscrimination.   It cannot sensibly be used to answer the different\n\nquestion of whether discriminatory effect exists.      In other words,\n\nit is only once the fact of discrimination has been proved that the\n\nde minimis standard comes into play. It follows that the plaintiffs\n\ncannot succeed in this case merely by invoking the de minimis\n\nstandard and ignoring their burden to proffer substantial evidence\n\nof discrimination.\n\n           This result appeals to common sense.      Were we to require\n\nno showing beyond the de minimis level, no distinction would exist\n\nbetween the discriminatory effect test and the incidental burden\n\ntest employed by the Supreme Court in Pike, 397 U.S. at 142.     While\n\nthe Court has recognized that \"there is no clear line separating the\n\ncategory of state regulation that is virtually per se invalid under\n\nthe Commerce Clause, and the category subject to the Pike v. Bruce\n\nChurch balancing approach,\" Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. N.Y.\n\nState Liquor Auth., 476 U.S. 573, 579 (1986), it has nonetheless\n\ncontinued to maintain that distinction.         We do not propose to\n\nabolish it today.\n\n           In a last-ditch effort to put the genie back in the\n\nbottle, the plaintiffs essay a naked appeal to the logic of the\n\n\n                                -23-\n\fargument that some discriminatory effects must result from a regime\n\nthat allows consumers to go to in-state wineries and buy as much\n\nwine as they want but precludes them from ordering wine directly\n\nfrom out-of-state wineries.       Conjecture, however, cannot take the\n\nplace of proof.9\n\nIII.       CONCLUSION\n\n               We need go no further.   The short of the matter is that\n\nthe plaintiffs have not carried their burden of showing that the\n\nchallenged regulation is discriminatory in effect.       In the absence\n\nof such a showing, the plaintiffs' constitutional challenge fails.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       9\n      In any event, this sortie smacks of an attack on the import\nlimitation — and the plaintiffs have foresworn any direct attack on\nthat limitation. See supra note 2. They cannot have their cake\nand eat it too.\n\n                                   -24-\n\f",

The plaintiffs challenge this decision on the ground that it constitutes impermissible favoritism in violation of the dormant commerce clause. The district court found the challenge wanting.</p>\n<p>While the central principles on which the dormant commerce clause operates are well-developed, gray areas exist around the edges. We believe that Maine's exception for small wineries falls within one of these gray areas  and in those precincts, courts must proceed case by case. Here, after careful perscrutation of Maine's statutory scheme and its constitutional implications, we find no substantial evidence that the exception for small wineries actually discriminates against interstate commerce. Consequently, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p>This case has been submitted on a stipulated record. Those stipulations limn the statutory scheme by means of which Maine regulates the sale of wine. To any extent that the statutes themselves are ambiguous, we assume that they operate and are enforced in the manner agreed upon by the parties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Statutory Scheme.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As a general matter Maine, like many states, has chosen to regulate the distribution of alcoholic beverages by requiring that producers sell exclusively to licensed wholesalers who, in turn, may sell only to licensed retailers. Consumers may purchase alcoholic beverages for off-premises consumption only from licensed retailers and may do so only in face-to-face transactions. This three-tiered system has been justified on multiple grounds: as an efficient means of controlling the distribution of alcoholic beverages, as an effective means of promoting temperance, and as a facilitating means of collecting excise taxes. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>North Dakota v. United States,</i> 495 U.S. 423, 432, 110 S.Ct. 1986, 109 L.Ed.2d 420 (1990) (recognizing these as legitimate grounds); <i>Wine &amp; Spirits Retailers, Inc. v. Rhode Island,</i> 481 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir.2007) (recognizing promotion of temperance and control of alcohol distribution as legitimate legislative purposes). Its legitimacy has been vouchsafed by no less an authority than the Supreme Court. <i>See </i><i>Granholm v. Heald,</i> 544 U.S. 460, 466, 125 S.Ct. 1885, 161 L.Ed.2d 796 (2005); <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> <i>North Dakota,</i> 495 U.S. at 432, 110 S.Ct. 1986.</p>\n<p>Consistent with this three-tiered system, Maine wineries may, for the most part, sell their wares in-state only to wholesalers. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 28-A, § 1361. But this edict admits of an exception for small vintners that obtain special \"farm winery\" licenses. <i>See id.</i> § 1355(3). To qualify for a farm winery license, a vineyard must produce no more than 50,000 gallons of wine annually, <i>see id.</i> § 1355(3)(A), and must pay a modest license fee ($50 per year), <i>see id.</i> § 1551(3)(F). There are no geographic restrictions applicable to farm wineries, and licenses are available on the same terms to wineries located throughout the United States. Despite this equal footing, no winery outside of Maine has yet applied for a farm winery license.</p>\n<p>Farm wineries enjoy a number of special prerogatives. For one thing, they may bypass wholesalers and sell directly to retailers and restaurants. <i>Id.</i> § 1355(3)(D). For another thing, they may sell directly to consumers; provided, however, that the transactions take place on the winery's premises or at one of up to two off-site locations established by the winery. <i>Id.</i> § 1355(3)(B)-(C). Out-of-state wineries may establish off-site sales outlets on the same basis as in-state wineries.</p>\n<p>Sales made by farm wineries directly to consumers, wherever consummated, must be face to face. <i>Id.</i> This means, of course, that wine cannot be direct-shipped from a winery to a consumer. Indeed, Maine law expressly forbids the furnishing of alcoholic beverages via mail order services, <i>see id.</i> § 2077-B, and farm wineries are not exempt from that prohibition. Were a non-Maine winery to obtain a farm winery license, it too would be subject to this prohibition and could sell its products to Maine consumers only on the winery's premises or at a designated off-site location.</p>\n<p>An additional provision of the statutory regime impinges indirectly upon the ability of out-of-state wineries to sell directly to Maine consumers. <i>See id.</i> § 2077. That provision prohibits a Maine resident from bringing more than four quarts of wine (typically five bottles) into the state. <i>Id.</i> Individuals may obtain relief from this import limitation only by special request. <i>Id.</i> § 2073(3)(A). Such requests are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by a state agency. <i>Id.</i> The parties have stipulated that, when requested, such permission is \"generally granted.\" In the absence of such a dispensation, a Maine resident visiting an out-of-state winery and purchasing wine in person would be statutorily forbidden from bringing more than four quarts home with her, and the winery would be statutorily forbidden from shipping purchased wine to consumers in Maine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Travel of the Case.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We turn now from the statutory scheme to the particulars of this case. On September 27, 2005, two plaintiffs  Dr. Philip Brooks, a Maine resident and oenophile, and Cherry Hill Vineyard, LLC, an Oregon winery that produces fewer than 50,000 gallons of wine a year  filed a civil action in Maine's federal district court against a number of state hierarchs.<sup>[1]</sup> In their complaint, they alleged that Maine's farm winery program, in conjunction with the prohibition on direct shipping, has the effect of discriminating against interstate commerce in violation of the dormant commerce <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> clause.<sup>[2]</sup> They prayed for a declaration that the statutory scheme is unconstitutional insofar as it prevents out-of-state wineries from selling their merchandise directly to Maine consumers. Relatedly, they sought injunctive relief barring enforcement of sections 1361(4), 2077, and 2077-B against wineries that choose to sell or ship their wares directly to Maine consumers.</p>\n<p>The State defended the face-to-face transactional requirement and the related restriction on direct shipping as necessary to prevent underage persons from gaining access to alcoholic beverages. Wholesalers and retailers have a vested interest in the three-tiered system and, by leave of court, a trade group  the Maine Beer and Wine Wholesalers Association  appeared as an amicus curiae in support of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p>The parties compiled a stipulated record and cross-moved for summary judgment. The district court referred the motions to a magistrate judge, who concluded that the face-to-face transactional requirement and the related ban on direct shipping, as memorialized in Maine's statutory scheme, did not discriminate against interstate commerce but, instead, comprised a reasonable exercise in regulation designed to forestall the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors. <i>Cherry Hill Vineyard, LLC v. Baldacci,</i> Civ. No. 05-153, 2006 WL 2121192, at *8-9 (D.Me. July 27, 2006). The district court summarily adopted the magistrate judge's recommended decision and granted summary judgment for the defendants. <i>Cherry Hill Vineyard, LLC v. Baldacci,</i> Civ. No. 05-153 (D.Me. Mar. 5, 2007) (unpublished). This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p>We note, with appreciation, that five separate sets of amici have filed helpful briefs (all of them urging affirmance of the judgment below). There is an interesting wrinkle concerning the arguments advanced by the amici. The plaintiffs, citing our decisions in <i>United States v. Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co.,</i> 84 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1996), and <i>Rhode Island v. Narragansett Indian Tribe,</i> 19 F.3d 685, 705 n. 22 (1st Cir.1994), argue that amici cannot raise new arguments. In both of the cited cases, however, amici wished to advance novel arguments on behalf of <i>appellants.</i> Here, the amici have appeared in support of the <i>appellees.</i> Given our settled rule that an appellate court may affirm the entry of summary judgment on any ground made manifest by the record, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Iverson v. City of Boston,</i> 452 F.3d 94, 98 (1st Cir.2006), this is quite probably a material difference. In any event, the point is of mainly academic interest, as we affirm on the basis of a line of argument consistently propounded by the State.</p>\n<p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p>Because the district court acted under the aegis of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, our review is de novo. <i>See </i><i>Auburn Police Union v. Carpenter,</i> 8 F.3d 886, 892 (1st Cir.1993). Here, our de novo review begins with first principles. The Constitution grants Congress the power to \"regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3. This affirmative grant of power to the federal sovereign has long been understood, by necessary implication, to strip <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> state governments of any authority to impede the flow of goods between states. <i>See </i><i>Alliance of Auto. Mfrs. v. Gwadosky,</i> 430 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>The doctrine that surrounds this principle, sometimes referred to as the dormant commerce clause, holds that a state regulation that discriminates against interstate commerce on its face, in purpose, or in effect is highly suspect and will be sustained only when it promotes a legitimate state interest that cannot be achieved through any reasonable nondiscriminatory alternative. <i>Id.</i> Laws that regulate evenhandedly and only incidentally burden commerce are subjected to less searching scrutiny under a balancing test, which operates to validate a challenged regulation unless it burdens commerce in a way that is \"clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits\" to be derived therefrom. <i>Wine &amp; Spirits Retailers,</i> 481 F.3d at 11 (citing <i>Pike v. Bruce Church,</i> 397 U.S. 137, 142, 90 S.Ct. 844, 25 L.Ed.2d 174 (1970)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Plaintiffs' Argument.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>This is a rifle-shot appeal. The plaintiffs do not advance any argument under the <i>Pike</i> balancing test. They must, therefore, avail themselves of the strict scrutiny reserved for statutes that frankly discriminate against interstate commerce. Even within that taxonomy, the plaintiffs' objection is narrow; they forgo any argument that the challenged portions of Maine's statutory scheme are discriminatory either on their face or in their conceived purpose.</p>\n<p>Winnowing out these possibilities, the plaintiffs pin their hopes on the isthmian claim that the challenged portions of the Maine regime are discriminatory in effect, that is, that by allowing direct sales to consumers only in face-to-face transactions, the statutory scheme has the practical effect of benefitting Maine wineries at the expense of their out-of-state competitors. In advancing this argument, the plaintiffs remind us that, for this purpose, discrimination has been broadly defined as \"differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.\" <i>Or. Waste Sys. v. Dep't of Envtl. Quality,</i> 511 U.S. 93, 99, 114 S.Ct. 1345, 128 L.Ed.2d 13 (1994).</p>\n<p>Challenges of this type have a theoretical basis in the case law. Even facially neutral laws enacted without discriminatory motive and in furtherance of legitimate local objectives may be discriminatory in effect (and, thus, engender strict scrutiny under the jurisprudence of the dormant commerce clause). <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Comm'n,</i> 432 U.S. 333, 352-53, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977); <i>Trailer Marine Transp. Corp. v. Rivera Vazquez,</i> 977 F.2d 1, 10 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n<p>When such a challenge is mounted, the initial burden of establishing discrimination rests with the challenger. <i>See </i><i>Hughes v. Oklahoma,</i> 441 U.S. 322, 336, 99 S.Ct. 1727, 60 L.Ed.2d 250 (1979). Once discrimination is established, however, the devoir of persuasion shifts and the affected state must demonstrate that no reasonable nondiscriminatory regulation could achieve its objectives. <i>See </i><i>New Energy Co. v. Limbach,</i> 486 U.S. 269, 278, 108 S.Ct. 1803, 100 L.Ed.2d 302 (1988).</p>\n<p>With this background in place, we frame the issue. The plaintiffs argue that the requirement that direct sales take place on winery premises effectively prevents out-of-state wineries, many of which are geographically distant, from enjoying any real opportunity of selling directly to consumers. In-state wineries, the plaintiffs say, are not similarly disadvantaged <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> because consumers can much more readily travel to their premises. So, the plaintiffs' thesis runs, the regime's effect is to raise the cost of, say, west coast wines as compared to Maine wines since the former will, as a practical matter, be available to consumers only after the addition of hefty \"middleman\" mark-ups.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See generally </i><i>Granholm,</i> 544 U.S. at 474, 125 S.Ct. 1885 (calling the retailer and wholesaler \"two extra layers of overhead\" that \"increase . . . cost\"). Moreover, wines produced by small out-of-state wineries that are unable to attract the attention of a retailer or wholesaler may be unavailable in Maine altogether. Indeed, the plaintiffs argue, in order to reach Maine consumers for face-to-face transactions, out-of-state wineries would necessarily be burdened with opening off-site locations within the Maine market. Establishing that kind of presence would further escalate costs.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The plaintiffs conclude by asserting that the discriminatory burden imposed by the face-to-face sales requirement and the related ban on direct shipping cannot be justified as necessary to any legitimate governmental interest. They insist that the State can fulfill its goal of restricting access to alcoholic beverages on the part of underage youths by, say, mandating that carriers delivering wine to direct purchasers confirm that recipients are at least twenty-one years of age. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Mich. Comp. Laws § 436.1203 (taking this approach). On this basis, the plaintiffs asseverate that the face-to-face requirement and the related ban on direct shipping cannot withstand strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Rejoinder.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Although vigorously asserted by able counsel, this argument lacks force. When all is said and done, the plaintiffs have not satisfied their initial burden of showing that Maine's statutory scheme is discriminatory in effect. Without such evidence, we must defer to the state legislature, which \"has `virtually complete control' over the importation and sale of liquor and the structure of the liquor distribution system.\" <i>North Dakota,</i> 495 U.S. at 431, 110 S.Ct. 1986 (quoting <i>Cal. Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Alum., Inc.,</i> 445 U.S. 97, 110, 100 S.Ct. 937, 63 L.Ed.2d 233 (1980)).</p>\n<p>To be sure, the plaintiffs cite a plethora of cases in endeavoring to demonstrate that the expense added by the restriction on direct shipment offends the dormant commerce clause. But these decisions are not capable of carrying the weight that the plaintiffs load upon them.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' most loudly bruited authority is <i>Granholm,</i> in which the Supreme Court invalidated Michigan and New York restrictions on the direct shipping of alcohol by out-of-state wineries. Despite some superficial similarities, the fit between <i>Granholm</i> and this case is not exact and, thus, the decision is of limited utility here.<sup>[5]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> The novel aspect of <i>Granholm</i> was the Court's holding that the Twenty-First Amendment  a constitutional provision dealing with the regulatory power of the several states in regard to the manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages  cannot salvage explicitly discriminatory regimes even though the regulated product is an alcoholic beverage. <i>See </i><i>Granholm,</i> 544 U.S. at 493, 125 S.Ct. 1885. The Twenty-First Amendment is only peripherally involved in this case, and does not require discussion. On the issue before us, <i>Granholm</i> does not dictate the result. That opinion provides less than complete guidance, and virtually no new elaboration, with respect to what does  or does not  constitute discrimination against interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>Both the Michigan and New York schemes invalidated in <i>Granholm</i> discriminated against out-of-state purveyors  and did so in ways that long have been understood to be unconstitutional. <i>See id.</i> at 467, 125 S.Ct. 1885 (terming the discrimination \"explicit\"); <i>see also id.</i> at 472-76, 125 S.Ct. 1885. The Michigan scheme was discriminatory on its face  it allowed in-state producers to ship wines directly to Michigan consumers while banning out-of-state producers from doing so. <i>See id.</i> at 473-74, 125 S.Ct. 1885. Thus, the finding of unconstitutionality does not assist the present plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>The New York scheme was closer, but still different; it allowed wineries to direct-ship only if they first established a physical presence in New York. <i>See id.</i> at 474, 125 S.Ct. 1885. The scheme was found to \"allow in-state wineries to sell wine directly to consumers in that State but to prohibit out-of-state wineries from doing so, or, at the least, to make direct sales impractical from an economic standpoint.\" <i>Id.</i> at 466, 125 S.Ct. 1885. The plaintiffs insist that the Maine scheme operates much the same as the New York scheme because, in practical effect, it gives in-state producers preferential access to consumers. While one district court, drawing heavily on <i>Granholm,</i> has found discriminatory a requirement that direct wine sales be made face to face, <i>see </i><i>Cherry Hill Vineyard, LLC v. Hudgins,</i> 488 F.Supp.2d 601, 618-19 (W.D.Ky.2006), other courts disagree, <i>see, e.g., Baude v. Heath,</i> Civ. No. 05-0735 [2007 WL 2479587, at *16 n. 25] (S.D.Ind. Aug. 29, 2007); <i>Jelovsek v. Bresden,</i> 482 F.Supp.2d 1013, 1020-21 (E.D.Tenn.2007); <i>Hurley v. Minner,</i> Civ. No. 05-826, 2006 WL 2789164, at *6 (D.Del. Sept. 26, 2006).</p>\n<p>We concur with the latter courts. The plaintiffs in this case overlook a key distinction between the New York and Maine statutes. New York created an additional barrier to the entry of out-of-state wineries into the direct-shipping market  a barrier that Maine has not erected. To elaborate, New York created a direct-shipping market for wine; it allowed direct shipping on particular conditions, and those conditions were rigged to favor in-state wineries (which, unlike out-of-state wineries, would not have to set up separate sales outlets within New York's boundaries). <i>See </i><i>Granholm,</i> 544 U.S. at 474, 125 S.Ct. 1885. Maine flatly outlaws any and all direct shipping of wine. Consequently, there is no direct-shipping market; neither in-state nor out-of-state wineries may direct-ship. Hence, while well-established legal rules demanded the invalidation of both the Michigan and New York schemes, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Or. Waste Sys.,</i> 511 U.S. at 99-100, 114 S.Ct. 1345, those rules do not demand any such ukase here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> By the same token, most of the other cases chronicled by the plaintiffs involve statutes that  unlike the Maine regime at issue here  explicitly discriminate against out-of-state goods or products. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 99, 114 S.Ct. 1345; <i>Chem. Waste Mgmt., Inc. v. Hunt,</i> 504 U.S. 334, 342, 112 S.Ct. 2009, 119 L.Ed.2d 121 (1992); <i>City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey,</i> 437 U.S. 617, 627, 98 S.Ct. 2531, 57 L.Ed.2d 475 (1978). These cases are distinguishable because Maine's statutory scheme vis-à-vis farm wineries does not explicitly discriminate against interstate commerce. Farm winery licenses are available on equal terms to in-state and out-of-state vineyards alike, and Maine's ban on the direct shipping of wine applies evenhandedly across the board.</p>\n<p>We are, then, on <i>terra incognita.</i> In the absence of any explicit (i.e., facial) discrimination, the plaintiffs must persuade us that Maine's evenhanded requirement that <i>all</i> wine purchases be made face to face camouflages some more sinister reality: that its practical effect is invidiously discriminatory. This is a burden that litigants in analogous cases ordinarily have failed to carry. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Pataki,</i> 320 F.3d 200, 212-14 (2d Cir.2003) (upholding, as against a dormant commerce clause challenge, state law requiring that all tobacco sales be conducted in face-to-face transactions).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has not directly spoken to the question of what showing is required to prove discriminatory effect where, as here, a statute is evenhanded on its face and wholesome in its purpose. In our view, that showing must be substantial  and an examination of the evidence in the record satisfies us that the plaintiffs have not pushed past this plateau. We explain briefly.</p>\n<p>We previously have held that a plaintiff bringing a dormant commerce clause challenge based exclusively on the allegedly discriminatory effect of a statutory scheme is required to submit some probative evidence of adverse impact. <i>See </i><i>Alliance of Auto. Mfrs.,</i> 430 F.3d at 41 (upholding summary judgment when plaintiff \"offered only prognostications woven from the gossamer strands of speculation and surmise, unaccompanied by any significantly probative evidence\" of a discriminatory effect on commerce); <i>accord </i><i>R &amp; M Oil &amp; Supply, Inc. v. Saunders,</i> 307 F.3d 731, 735 (8th Cir.2002) (holding that plaintiff had failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove discriminatory effect); <i>E. Ky. Res. v. Fiscal Ct. of Magoffin County,</i> 127 F.3d 532, 544 (6th Cir.1997) (finding no discriminatory effect when plaintiffs failed to present evidence showing how out-of-state entities, as compared to in-state entities, were burdened).</p>\n<p>Sweeping aside rhetorical flourishes, the plaintiffs have proffered no evidence that permitting farm wineries to sell only face to face, either on premises or at approved in-state locations, discriminates against interstate commerce. There is no evidence that Maine law acts to protect Maine vineyards or that Maine consumers substitute wines purchased directly from Maine vineyards for wines that they otherwise would have purchased from out-of-state producers. There is not even evidence that any wines at all are purchased by consumers directly from Maine vineyards. And, finally, nothing contained in the stipulated record suggests that the locus option somehow alters the competitive balance between in-state and out-of-state firms. <i>Cf. </i><i>Hunt,</i> 432 U.S. at 351, 97 S.Ct. 2434 (holding that statutory scheme designed to eliminate out-of-state companies' competitive advantage in marketing created an unconstitutionally discriminatory effect).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> The substitution scenario is further weakened by the fact that the plaintiffs have adduced no evidence that would in any way undermine the plausible impression that Maine consumers (like imbibers everywhere) view trips to a winery as a distinct experience incommensurate with  and, therefore, unlikely to be replaced by  a trip to either a mailbox or a retail liquor store. <i>See </i><i>Jelovsek,</i> 482 F.Supp.2d at 1021 (observing that \"it seems the market for on-site wine purchases, requiring the effort (or pleasure) of a trip to the winery, is different in kind and reach from the convenience-oriented market that would be created and facilitated by a law allowing direct-shipping\").<sup>[6]</sup> Nor have they offered evidence to impeach the suggestion, made in one of the cases on which they rely, that bottles of wine are unique and, thus, unlikely to be perceived by consumers as interchangeable. <i>See </i><i>Hudgins,</i> 488 F.Supp.2d at 617; <i>see also </i><i>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Tracy,</i> 519 U.S. 278, 299, 117 S.Ct. 811, 136 L.Ed.2d 761 (1997) (observing that \"difference[s] in products may mean that the different entities serve different markets, and would continue to do so even if the supposedly discriminatory burden were removed\").</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' principal effort to fill this void involves a report prepared by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Drawing on this report, they argue that the ban on direct shipping raises the cost of out-of-state wines and prices some wines out of the Maine market altogether. FTC, Possible Anticompetitive Barriers to E-Commerce: Wine (July 2003) [FTC Report], <i>available at</i> http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/07/ winereport2.pdf (last visited Sept. 20, 2007). But nothing in the FTC Report establishes that the farm winery exception disproportionately burdens interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs also repeatedly cite <i>Associated Indus. of Mo. v. Lohman,</i> 511 U.S. 641, 114 S.Ct. 1815, 128 L.Ed.2d 639 (1994), for the proposition that discrimination should be measured in dollars and cents, such as in lost sales. <i>See id.</i> at 654, 114 S.Ct. 1815. Even if that is so, however, the plaintiffs have not shown a single penny of losses attributable to the allegedly discriminatory farm winery exception. They invite us to infer the existence of such losses but prudence requires that we decline that invitation. In our judgment, the mere fact that a statutory regime has a discriminatory <i>potential</i> is not enough to trigger strict scrutiny under the dormant commerce clause. <i>See id.</i> (noting that the Justices \"have never deemed a hypothetical possibility of favoritism to constitute discrimination that transgresses constitutional commands\"). There must be substantial evidence of an actual discriminatory effect, and such evidence is utterly absent here.<sup>[7]</sup> Given Maine's large land mass and the concentration <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> of its population in the southern end of the state, <i>see </i><i>Grant's Dairy  Me., LLC v. Comm'r of Me. Dep't of Agric., Food &amp; Rural Res.,</i> 232 F.3d 8, 21 (1st Cir.2000), it cannot plausibly be said that the farm winery exception redounds to the exclusive benefit of Maine vineyards. Rather, whatever minimal benefits might be inferred from the structure of the scheme itself seem largely to be dispersed on the basis of geography.</p>\n<p>In short, there is simply no evidence that out-of-state wineries suffer any disproportionate loss of business on account of Maine's direct-shipping ban. The plaintiffs have made no showing that any discrimination vis-à-vis access to the Maine market actually results from the farm winery exception itself. While the FTC Report and the plaintiffs' other evidentiary proffers suggest that a direct-shipping ban harms out-of-state producers, the plaintiffs acknowledge that the \"constricted availability of wine is due in large part to the three-tier system itself.\" Appellants' Br. at 10. Because the three-tiered system has not been challenged here, this acknowledgment undercuts any inference that the allegedly discriminatory farm winery exception is responsible for the perceived harm.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' response to this lack of evidence is an assertion that even if \"the impact is small because direct sales do not constitute a significant market and . . . in-state wineries do not do much walk-in business,\" the regime is nonetheless unconstitutional because the dormant commerce clause contains no de minimis exception. Appellants' Reply Br. at 8. But the case upon which they rely for this proposition, <i>Camps Newfound/Owatonna v. Town of Harrison,</i> 520 U.S. 564, 117 S.Ct. 1590, 137 L.Ed.2d 852 (1997), concerned a statute that was discriminatory on its face. <i>See id.</i> at 581, 117 S.Ct. 1590. It strikes us as implausible that the same de minimis standard would apply when evaluating whether a facially neutral statute has a discriminatory effect on interstate commerce. <i>See </i><i>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco,</i> 320 F.3d at 216 (finding a \"de minimis advantage to in-state [companies] . . . insufficient to establish a discriminatory effect\"); <i>cf. </i><i>New Energy,</i> 486 U.S. at 276, 108 S.Ct. 1803 (commenting that \"<i>where discrimination is patent</i> . . . neither a widespread advantage to in-state interests nor a widespread disadvantage to out-of-state competitors need be shown\") (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p>The de minimis standard, when used in cases involving facially discriminatory laws, speaks to the <i>degree</i> of discrimination. It cannot sensibly be used to answer the different question of whether discriminatory effect exists. In other words, it is only once the fact of discrimination has been proved that the de minimis standard comes into play. It follows that the plaintiffs cannot succeed in this case merely by invoking the de minimis standard and ignoring their burden to proffer substantial evidence of discrimination.</p>\n<p>This result appeals to common sense. Were we to require no showing beyond the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> de minimis level, no distinction would exist between the discriminatory effect test and the incidental burden test employed by the Supreme Court in <i>Pike,</i> 397 U.S. at 142, 90 S.Ct. 844. While the Court has recognized that \"there is no clear line separating the category of state regulation that is virtually <i>per se</i> invalid under the Commerce Clause, and the category subject to the <i>Pike v. Bruce Church</i> balancing approach,\" <i>Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. N.Y. State Liquor Auth.,</i> 476 U.S. 573, 579, 106 S.Ct. 2080, 90 L.Ed.2d 552 (1986), it has nonetheless continued to maintain that distinction. We do not propose to abolish it today.</p>\n<p>In a last-ditch effort to put the genie back in the bottle, the plaintiffs essay a naked appeal to the logic of the argument that some discriminatory effects must result from a regime that allows consumers to go to in-state wineries and buy as much wine as they want but precludes them from ordering wine directly from out-of-state wineries. Conjecture, however, cannot take the place of proof.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p>We need go no further. The short of the matter is that the plaintiffs have not carried their burden of showing that the challenged regulation is discriminatory in effect. In the absence of such a showing, the plaintiffs' constitutional challenge fails.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The defendants, all of whom are sued in their official capacities, are the governor, the attorney general, and the two ranking officers of Maine's Bureau of Liquor Enforcement. We sometimes refer to the defendants, collectively, as \"Maine\" or \"the State.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  We think it noteworthy that the plaintiffs have not challenged the importation limit, <i>see</i> Appellants' Br. at 15 n. 18, but, rather, treat it as aggravating the unconstitutional discrimination of which they complain. Because the plaintiffs have chosen to focus their challenge on the farm winery exception and the face-to-face sales requirement, we eschew any particularized analysis of the constitutionality of the importation limit.</p>\n<p>[3]  In mounting this argument, the plaintiffs attempt to distinguish between the cost attributable to the statutory requirements and any added expense that is attributable to geographic reality (for example, the fact that Oregon wine must be shipped cross-country in order to reach Maine consumers will inevitably add to its cost).</p>\n<p>[4]  Although the plaintiffs do not challenge Maine's four-quart importation limit, <i>see supra</i> note 2, they complain that their disadvantage is compounded by that limit. In practice, the importation limit prevents even committed wine collectors who are willing to travel from bringing home enough wine to justify the journey.</p>\n<p>[5]  The <i>Granholm</i> Court did express skepticism as to whether a ban on direct shipping furthers the goal of limiting the access of underage youths to alcohol. <i>See</i> 544 U.S. at 490, 125 S.Ct. 1885. Thus, were the plaintiffs able to carry their initial burden of putting forth substantial evidence showing an impermissibly discriminatory effect, <i>Granholm</i> might have more impact on other elements within the decisional calculus.</p>\n<p>[6]  The plaintiffs question the discussion in <i>Jelovsek,</i> presently pending on appeal before the Sixth Circuit, on the ground that the case was decided on the pleadings. Whatever the situation in <i>Jelovsek,</i> the plaintiffs here had ample opportunity to flesh out the record, yet they still have not been able to furnish probative evidence of discriminatory effect.</p>\n<p>[7]  Cherry Hill's complaint that it will be forced to establish off-site locations geographically closer to Maine consumers in order to attract Maine business appears in some sense to be a complaint about the effects of geography. Distance is not congruent with state lines, and the effects of geography alone do not constitute impermissible discrimination. An effect is not discriminatory, in violation of the dormant commerce clause, if it results from natural conditions. <i>See </i><i>Doran v. Mass. Turnpike Auth.,</i> 348 F.3d 315, 319 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Grant's Dairy  Me., LLC v. Comm'r of Me. Dep't of Agric., Food &amp; Rural Res.,</i> 232 F.3d 8, 21 (1st Cir.2000); <i>see also Baude,</i> Civ. No. 05-0735, at *27-28.</p>\n<p>[8]  To be sure, <i>Granholm</i> may reflect a retrenchment of the broad state power over the distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages that characterized earlier Supreme Court jurisprudence. But it does not appear, on the basis of <i>Granholm</i> alone, that a challenge can successfully be mounted to the three-tiered system. <i>See </i><i>Granholm,</i> 544 U.S. at 466, 125 S.Ct. 1885 (reaffirming that \"States can mandate a three-tier distribution scheme in the exercise of their authority under the Twenty-first Amendment\"); <i>id.</i> at 493, 125 S.Ct. 1885 (\"If a State chooses to allow direct shipment of wine, it must do so on evenhanded terms.\"); <i>see also</i> U.S. Const. amend. XXI. Any further step away from such a scheme is for the Supreme Court to take.</p>\n<p>[9]  In any event, this sortie smacks of an attack on the import limitation-and the plaintiffs have foresworn any direct attack on that limitation. <i>See supra</i> note 2. They cannot have their cake and eat it too.</p>\n\n</div>",

The plaintiffs challenge this decision on the ground that it constitutes impermissible favoritism in violation of the dormant commerce clause. The district court found the challenge wanting.</p>\n<p>While the central principles on which the dormant commerce clause operates are well-developed, gray areas exist around the edges. We believe that Maine's exception for small wineries falls within one of these gray areas  and in those precincts, courts must proceed case by case. Here, after careful perscrutation of Maine's statutory scheme and its constitutional implications, we find no substantial evidence that the exception for small wineries actually discriminates against interstate commerce. Consequently, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p>This case has been submitted on a stipulated record. Those stipulations limn the statutory scheme by means of which Maine regulates the sale of wine. To any extent that the statutes themselves are ambiguous, we assume that they operate and are enforced in the manner agreed upon by the parties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Statutory Scheme.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As a general matter Maine, like many states, has chosen to regulate the distribution of alcoholic beverages by requiring that producers sell exclusively to licensed wholesalers who, in turn, may sell only to licensed retailers. Consumers may purchase alcoholic beverages for off-premises consumption only from licensed retailers and may do so only in face-to-face transactions. This three-tiered system has been justified on multiple grounds: as an efficient means of controlling the distribution of alcoholic beverages, as an effective means of promoting temperance, and as a facilitating means of collecting excise taxes. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>North Dakota v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112429\"><a href=\"/opinion/112429/north-dakota-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span>, 432, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112429\"><a href=\"/opinion/112429/north-dakota-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Its legitimacy has been vouchsafed by no less an authority than the Supreme Court. <i>See </i><i>Granholm v. Heald,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142893\"><a href=\"/opinion/142893/granholm-v-heald/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span>, 466, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142893\"><a href=\"/opinion/142893/granholm-v-heald/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1986</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Consistent with this three-tiered system, Maine wineries may, for the most part, sell their wares in-state only to wholesalers. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 28-A, § 1361. But this edict admits of an exception for small vintners that obtain special \"farm winery\" licenses. <i>See id.</i> § 1355(3). To qualify for a farm winery license, a vineyard must produce no more than 50,000 gallons of wine annually, <i>see id.</i> § 1355(3)(A), and must pay a modest license fee ($50 per year), <i>see id.</i> § 1551(3)(F). There are no geographic restrictions applicable to farm wineries, and licenses are available on the same terms to wineries located throughout the United States. Despite this equal footing, no winery outside of Maine has yet applied for a farm winery license.</p>\n<p>Farm wineries enjoy a number of special prerogatives. For one thing, they may bypass wholesalers and sell directly to retailers and restaurants. <i>Id.</i> § 1355(3)(D). For another thing, they may sell directly to consumers; provided, however, that the transactions take place on the winery's premises or at one of up to two off-site locations established by the winery. <i>Id.</i> § 1355(3)(B)-(C). Out-of-state wineries may establish off-site sales outlets on the same basis as in-state wineries.</p>\n<p>Sales made by farm wineries directly to consumers, wherever consummated, must be face to face. <i>Id.</i> This means, of course, that wine cannot be direct-shipped from a winery to a consumer. Indeed, Maine law expressly forbids the furnishing of alcoholic beverages via mail order services, <i>see id.</i> § 2077-B, and farm wineries are not exempt from that prohibition. Were a non-Maine winery to obtain a farm winery license, it too would be subject to this prohibition and could sell its products to Maine consumers only on the winery's premises or at a designated off-site location.</p>\n<p>An additional provision of the statutory regime impinges indirectly upon the ability of out-of-state wineries to sell directly to Maine consumers. <i>See id.</i> § 2077. That provision prohibits a Maine resident from bringing more than four quarts of wine (typically five bottles) into the state. <i>Id.</i> Individuals may obtain relief from this import limitation only by special request. <i>Id.</i> § 2073(3)(A). Such requests are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by a state agency. <i>Id.</i> The parties have stipulated that, when requested, such permission is \"generally granted.\" In the absence of such a dispensation, a Maine resident visiting an out-of-state winery and purchasing wine in person would be statutorily forbidden from bringing more than four quarts home with her, and the winery would be statutorily forbidden from shipping purchased wine to consumers in Maine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Travel of the Case.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We turn now from the statutory scheme to the particulars of this case. On September 27, 2005, two plaintiffs  Dr. Philip Brooks, a Maine resident and oenophile, and Cherry Hill Vineyard, LLC, an Oregon winery that produces fewer than 50,000 gallons of wine a year  filed a civil action in Maine's federal district court against a number of state hierarchs.<sup>[1]</sup> In their complaint, they alleged that Maine's farm winery program, in conjunction with the prohibition on direct shipping, has the effect of discriminating against interstate commerce in violation of the dormant commerce <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> clause.<sup>[2]</sup> They prayed for a declaration that the statutory scheme is unconstitutional insofar as it prevents out-of-state wineries from selling their merchandise directly to Maine consumers. Relatedly, they sought injunctive relief barring enforcement of sections 1361(4), 2077, and 2077-B against wineries that choose to sell or ship their wares directly to Maine consumers.</p>\n<p>The State defended the face-to-face transactional requirement and the related restriction on direct shipping as necessary to prevent underage persons from gaining access to alcoholic beverages. Wholesalers and retailers have a vested interest in the three-tiered system and, by leave of court, a trade group  the Maine Beer and Wine Wholesalers Association  appeared as an amicus curiae in support of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p>The parties compiled a stipulated record and cross-moved for summary judgment. The district court referred the motions to a magistrate judge, who concluded that the face-to-face transactional requirement and the related ban on direct shipping, as memorialized in Maine's statutory scheme, did not discriminate against interstate commerce but, instead, comprised a reasonable exercise in regulation designed to forestall the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors. <i>Cherry Hill Vineyard, LLC v. Baldacci,</i> Civ. No. 05-153, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2121192</span></span>, at *8-9 (D.Me. July 27, 2006). The district court summarily adopted the magistrate judge's recommended decision and granted summary judgment for the defendants. <i>Cherry Hill Vineyard, LLC v. Baldacci,</i> Civ. No. 05-153 (D.Me. Mar. 5, 2007) (unpublished). This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p>We note, with appreciation, that five separate sets of amici have filed helpful briefs (all of them urging affirmance of the judgment below). There is an interesting wrinkle concerning the arguments advanced by the amici. The plaintiffs, citing our decisions in <i>United States v. Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718328\"><a href=\"/opinion/718328/united-states-v-sturm-ruger-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1996), and <i>Rhode Island v. Narragansett Indian Tribe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195256\"><a href=\"/opinion/195256/state-of-ri-v-narragansett-tribe/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span>, 705 n. 22 (1st Cir.1994), argue that amici cannot raise new arguments. In both of the cited cases, however, amici wished to advance novel arguments on behalf of <i>appellants.</i> Here, the amici have appeared in support of the <i>appellees.</i> Given our settled rule that an appellate court may affirm the entry of summary judgment on any ground made manifest by the record, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Iverson v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202298\"><a href=\"/opinion/202298/iverson-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 98 (1st Cir.2006), this is quite probably a material difference. In any event, the point is of mainly academic interest, as we affirm on the basis of a line of argument consistently propounded by the State.</p>\n<p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p>Because the district court acted under the aegis of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, our review is de novo. <i>See </i><i>Auburn Police Union v. Carpenter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656566\"><a href=\"/opinion/656566/auburn-police-union-v-michael-e-carpenter-attorney-general-of-the-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span>, 892 (1st Cir.1993). Here, our de novo review begins with first principles. The Constitution grants Congress the power to \"regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3. This affirmative grant of power to the federal sovereign has long been understood, by necessary implication, to strip <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> state governments of any authority to impede the flow of goods between states. <i>See </i><i>Alliance of Auto. Mfrs. v. Gwadosky,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792535\"><a href=\"/opinion/792535/alliance-of-automobile-manufacturers-v-dan-a-gwadosky-in-his-official/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>The doctrine that surrounds this principle, sometimes referred to as the dormant commerce clause, holds that a state regulation that discriminates against interstate commerce on its face, in purpose, or in effect is highly suspect and will be sustained only when it promotes a legitimate state interest that cannot be achieved through any reasonable nondiscriminatory alternative. <i>Id.</i> Laws that regulate evenhandedly and only incidentally burden commerce are subjected to less searching scrutiny under a balancing test, which operates to validate a challenged regulation unless it burdens commerce in a way that is \"clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits\" to be derived therefrom. <i>Wine &amp; Spirits Retailers,</i> 481 F.3d at 11 (citing <i>Pike v. Bruce Church,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108085\"><a href=\"/opinion/108085/pike-v-bruce-church-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, 142, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108085\"><a href=\"/opinion/108085/pike-v-bruce-church-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span> (1970)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Plaintiffs' Argument.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>This is a rifle-shot appeal. The plaintiffs do not advance any argument under the <i>Pike</i> balancing test. They must, therefore, avail themselves of the strict scrutiny reserved for statutes that frankly discriminate against interstate commerce. Even within that taxonomy, the plaintiffs' objection is narrow; they forgo any argument that the challenged portions of Maine's statutory scheme are discriminatory either on their face or in their conceived purpose.</p>\n<p>Winnowing out these possibilities, the plaintiffs pin their hopes on the isthmian claim that the challenged portions of the Maine regime are discriminatory in effect, that is, that by allowing direct sales to consumers only in face-to-face transactions, the statutory scheme has the practical effect of benefitting Maine wineries at the expense of their out-of-state competitors. In advancing this argument, the plaintiffs remind us that, for this purpose, discrimination has been broadly defined as \"differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.\" <i>Or. Waste Sys. v. Dep't of Envtl. Quality,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117834\"><a href=\"/opinion/117834/oregon-waste-systems-inc-v-department-of-environmental-quality-of-ore/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 99, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117834\"><a href=\"/opinion/117834/oregon-waste-systems-inc-v-department-of-environmental-quality-of-ore/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span> (1994).</p>\n<p>Challenges of this type have a theoretical basis in the case law. Even facially neutral laws enacted without discriminatory motive and in furtherance of legitimate local objectives may be discriminatory in effect (and, thus, engender strict scrutiny under the jurisprudence of the dormant commerce clause). <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109703\"><a href=\"/opinion/109703/hunt-v-washington-state-apple-advertising-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span>, 352-53, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109703\"><a href=\"/opinion/109703/hunt-v-washington-state-apple-advertising-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Oklahoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110063\"><a href=\"/opinion/110063/hughes-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span>, 336, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110063\"><a href=\"/opinion/110063/hughes-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span> (1979). Once discrimination is established, however, the devoir of persuasion shifts and the affected state must demonstrate that no reasonable nondiscriminatory regulation could achieve its objectives. <i>See </i><i>New Energy Co. v. Limbach,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112081\"><a href=\"/opinion/112081/new-energy-co-of-ind-v-limbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span>, 278, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112081\"><a href=\"/opinion/112081/new-energy-co-of-ind-v-limbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span> (1988).</p>\n<p>With this background in place, we frame the issue. The plaintiffs argue that the requirement that direct sales take place on winery premises effectively prevents out-of-state wineries, many of which are geographically distant, from enjoying any real opportunity of selling directly to consumers. In-state wineries, the plaintiffs say, are not similarly disadvantaged <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> because consumers can much more readily travel to their premises. So, the plaintiffs' thesis runs, the regime's effect is to raise the cost of, say, west coast wines as compared to Maine wines since the former will, as a practical matter, be available to consumers only after the addition of hefty \"middleman\" mark-ups.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See generally </i><i>Granholm,</i> 544 U.S. at 474, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142893\"><a href=\"/opinion/142893/granholm-v-heald/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1885</span></a></span> (calling the retailer and wholesaler \"two extra layers of overhead\" that \"increase . . . cost\"). Moreover, wines produced by small out-of-state wineries that are unable to attract the attention of a retailer or wholesaler may be unavailable in Maine altogether. Indeed, the plaintiffs argue, in order to reach Maine consumers for face-to-face transactions, out-of-state wineries would necessarily be burdened with opening off-site locations within the Maine market. Establishing that kind of presence would further escalate costs.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The plaintiffs conclude by asserting that the discriminatory burden imposed by the face-to-face sales requirement and the related ban on direct shipping cannot be justified as necessary to any legitimate governmental interest. They insist that the State can fulfill its goal of restricting access to alcoholic beverages on the part of underage youths by, say, mandating that carriers delivering wine to direct purchasers confirm that recipients are at least twenty-one years of age. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Mich. Comp. Laws § 436.1203 (taking this approach). On this basis, the plaintiffs asseverate that the face-to-face requirement and the related ban on direct shipping cannot withstand strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Rejoinder.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Although vigorously asserted by able counsel, this argument lacks force. When all is said and done, the plaintiffs have not satisfied their initial burden of showing that Maine's statutory scheme is discriminatory in effect.

But these decisions are not capable of carrying the weight that the plaintiffs load upon them.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' most loudly bruited authority is <i>Granholm,</i> in which the Supreme Court invalidated Michigan and New York restrictions on the direct shipping of alcohol by out-of-state wineries. Despite some superficial similarities, the fit between <i>Granholm</i> and this case is not exact and, thus, the decision is of limited utility here.<sup>[5]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> The novel aspect of <i>Granholm</i> was the Court's holding that the Twenty-First Amendment  a constitutional provision dealing with the regulatory power of the several states in regard to the manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages  cannot salvage explicitly discriminatory regimes even though the regulated product is an alcoholic beverage. <i>See </i><i>Granholm,</i> 544 U.S. at 493, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142893\"><a href=\"/opinion/142893/granholm-v-heald/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Michigan scheme was discriminatory on its face  it allowed in-state producers to ship wines directly to Michigan consumers while banning out-of-state producers from doing so. <i>See id.</i> at 473-74, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142893\"><a href=\"/opinion/142893/granholm-v-heald/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, the finding of unconstitutionality does not assist the present plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>The New York scheme was closer, but still different; it allowed wineries to direct-ship only if they first established a physical presence in New York. <i>See id.</i> at 474, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142893\"><a href=\"/opinion/142893/granholm-v-heald/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The scheme was found to \"allow in-state wineries to sell wine directly to consumers in that State but to prohibit out-of-state wineries from doing so, or, at the least, to make direct sales impractical from an economic standpoint.\" <i>Id.</i> at 466, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142893\"><a href=\"/opinion/142893/granholm-v-heald/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The plaintiffs insist that the Maine scheme operates much the same as the New York scheme because, in practical effect, it gives in-state producers preferential access to consumers. While one district court, drawing heavily on <i>Granholm,</i> has found discriminatory a requirement that direct wine sales be made face to face, <i>see </i><i>Cherry Hill Vineyard, LLC v. Hudgins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2421510\"><a href=\"/opinion/2421510/cherry-hill-vineyards-llc-v-hudgins/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Sept. 26, 2006).</p>\n<p>We concur with the latter courts. The plaintiffs in this case overlook a key distinction between the New York and Maine statutes. New York created an additional barrier to the entry of out-of-state wineries into the direct-shipping market  a barrier that Maine has not erected. To elaborate, New York created a direct-shipping market for wine; it allowed direct shipping on particular conditions, and those conditions were rigged to favor in-state wineries (which, unlike out-of-state wineries, would not have to set up separate sales outlets within New York's boundaries). <i>See </i><i>Granholm,</i> 544 U.S. at 474, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142893\"><a href=\"/opinion/142893/granholm-v-heald/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1885</span></a></span>. Maine flatly outlaws any and all direct shipping of wine. Consequently, there is no direct-shipping market; neither in-state nor out-of-state wineries may direct-ship. Hence, while well-established legal rules demanded the invalidation of both the Michigan and New York schemes, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Or. Waste Sys.,</i> 511 U.S. at 99-100, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117834\"><a href=\"/opinion/117834/oregon-waste-systems-inc-v-department-of-environmental-quality-of-ore/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

These cases are distinguishable because Maine's statutory scheme vis-à-vis farm wineries does not explicitly discriminate against interstate commerce. Farm winery licenses are available on equal terms to in-state and out-of-state vineyards alike, and Maine's ban on the direct shipping of wine applies evenhandedly across the board.</p>\n<p>We are, then, on <i>terra incognita.</i> In the absence of any explicit (i.e., facial) discrimination, the plaintiffs must persuade us that Maine's evenhanded requirement that <i>all</i> wine purchases be made face to face camouflages some more sinister reality: that its practical effect is invidiously discriminatory. This is a burden that litigants in analogous cases ordinarily have failed to carry. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Pataki,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780939\"><a href=\"/opinion/780939/brown-williamson-tobacco-corporation-bwtdirect-llc-and-santa-fe-natural/\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 212-14 (2d Cir.2003) (upholding, as against a dormant commerce clause challenge, state law requiring that all tobacco sales be conducted in face-to-face transactions).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has not directly spoken to the question of what showing is required to prove discriminatory effect where, as here, a statute is evenhanded on its face and wholesome in its purpose. In our view, that showing must be substantial  and an examination of the evidence in the record satisfies us that the plaintiffs have not pushed past this plateau. We explain briefly.</p>\n<p>We previously have held that a plaintiff bringing a dormant commerce clause challenge based exclusively on the allegedly discriminatory effect of a statutory scheme is required to submit some probative evidence of adverse impact. <i>See </i><i>Alliance of Auto. Mfrs.,</i> 430 F.3d at 41 (upholding summary judgment when plaintiff \"offered only prognostications woven from the gossamer strands of speculation and surmise, unaccompanied by any significantly probative evidence\" of a discriminatory effect on commerce); <i>accord </i><i>R &amp; M Oil &amp; Supply, Inc. v.

There is no evidence that Maine law acts to protect Maine vineyards or that Maine consumers substitute wines purchased directly from Maine vineyards for wines that they otherwise would have purchased from out-of-state producers. There is not even evidence that any wines at all are purchased by consumers directly from Maine vineyards. And, finally, nothing contained in the stipulated record suggests that the locus option somehow alters the competitive balance between in-state and out-of-state firms. <i>Cf. </i><i>Hunt,</i> 432 U.S. at 351, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109703\"><a href=\"/opinion/109703/hunt-v-washington-state-apple-advertising-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Drawing on this report, they argue that the ban on direct shipping raises the cost of out-of-state wines and prices some wines out of the Maine market altogether. FTC, Possible Anticompetitive Barriers to E-Commerce: Wine (July 2003) [FTC Report], <i>available at</i> http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/07/ winereport2.pdf (last visited Sept. 20, 2007). But nothing in the FTC Report establishes that the farm winery exception disproportionately burdens interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs also repeatedly cite <i>Associated Indus. of Mo. v. Lohman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087947\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087947/associated-industries-of-mo-v-lohman/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087947\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087947/associated-industries-of-mo-v-lohman/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1815</span></a></span>. Even if that is so, however, the plaintiffs have not shown a single penny of losses attributable to the allegedly discriminatory farm winery exception. They invite us to infer the existence of such losses but prudence requires that we decline that invitation. In our judgment, the mere fact that a statutory regime has a discriminatory <i>potential</i> is not enough to trigger strict scrutiny under the dormant commerce clause. <i>See id.</i> (noting that the Justices \"have never deemed a hypothetical possibility of favoritism to constitute discrimination that transgresses constitutional commands\"). There must be substantial evidence of an actual discriminatory effect, and such evidence is utterly absent here.<sup>[7]</sup> Given Maine's large land mass and the concentration <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> of its population in the southern end of the state, <i>see </i><i>Grant's Dairy  Me., LLC v. Comm'r of Me. Dep't of Agric., Food &amp; Rural Res.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199150\"><a href=\"/opinion/199150/grants-dairy-maine-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.2000), it cannot plausibly be said that the farm winery exception redounds to the exclusive benefit of Maine vineyards. Rather, whatever minimal benefits might be inferred from the structure of the scheme itself seem largely to be dispersed on the basis of geography.</p>\n<p>In short, there is simply no evidence that out-of-state wineries suffer any disproportionate loss of business on account of Maine's direct-shipping ban. The plaintiffs have made no showing that any discrimination vis-à-vis access to the Maine market actually results from the farm winery exception itself. While the FTC Report and the plaintiffs' other evidentiary proffers suggest that a direct-shipping ban harms out-of-state producers, the plaintiffs acknowledge that the \"constricted availability of wine is due in large part to the three-tier system itself.\" Appellants' Br. at 10. Because the three-tiered system has not been challenged here, this acknowledgment undercuts any inference that the allegedly discriminatory farm winery exception is responsible for the perceived harm.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' response to this lack of evidence is an assertion that even if \"the impact is small because direct sales do not constitute a significant market and . . . in-state wineries do not do much walk-in business,\" the regime is nonetheless unconstitutional because the dormant commerce clause contains no de minimis exception. Appellants' Reply Br. at 8. But the case upon which they rely for this proposition, <i>Camps Newfound/Owatonna v. Town of Harrison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118111\"><a href=\"/opinion/118111/camps-newfoundowatonna-inc-v-town-of-harrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118111\"><a href=\"/opinion/118111/camps-newfoundowatonna-inc-v-town-of-harrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1590</span></a></span>. It strikes us as implausible that the same de minimis standard would apply when evaluating whether a facially neutral statute has a discriminatory effect on interstate commerce. <i>See </i><i>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco,</i> 320 F.3d at 216 (finding a \"de minimis advantage to in-state [companies] . . . insufficient to establish a discriminatory effect\"); <i>cf. </i><i>New Energy,</i> 486 U.S. at 276, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112081\"><a href=\"/opinion/112081/new-energy-co-of-ind-v-limbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1803</span></a></span> (commenting that \"<i>where discrimination is patent</i> . . . neither a widespread advantage to in-state interests nor a widespread disadvantage to out-of-state competitors need be shown\") (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p>The de minimis standard, when used in cases involving facially discriminatory laws, speaks to the <i>degree</i> of discrimination. It cannot sensibly be used to answer the different question of whether discriminatory effect exists. In other words, it is only once the fact of discrimination has been proved that the de minimis standard comes into play. It follows that the plaintiffs cannot succeed in this case merely by invoking the de minimis standard and ignoring their burden to proffer substantial evidence of discrimination.</p>\n<p>This result appeals to common sense. Were we to require no showing beyond the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> de minimis level, no distinction would exist between the discriminatory effect test and the incidental burden test employed by the Supreme Court in <i>Pike,</i> 397 U.S. at 142, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108085\"><a href=\"/opinion/108085/pike-v-bruce-church-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span>. While the Court has recognized that \"there is no clear line separating the category of state regulation that is virtually <i>per se</i> invalid under the Commerce Clause, and the category subject to the <i>Pike v. Bruce Church</i> balancing approach,\" <i>Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. N.Y. State Liquor Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111683\"><a href=\"/opinion/111683/brown-forman-distillers-corp-v-new-york-state-liquor-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span>, 579, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111683\"><a href=\"/opinion/111683/brown-forman-distillers-corp-v-new-york-state-liquor-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span> (1986), it has nonetheless continued to maintain that distinction. We do not propose to abolish it today.</p>\n<p>In a last-ditch effort to put the genie back in the bottle, the plaintiffs essay a naked appeal to the logic of the argument that some discriminatory effects must result from a regime that allows consumers to go to in-state wineries and buy as much wine as they want but precludes them from ordering wine directly from out-of-state wineries. Conjecture, however, cannot take the place of proof.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p>We need go no further. The short of the matter is that the plaintiffs have not carried their burden of showing that the challenged regulation is discriminatory in effect. In the absence of such a showing, the plaintiffs' constitutional challenge fails.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The defendants, all of whom are sued in their official capacities, are the governor, the attorney general, and the two ranking officers of Maine's Bureau of Liquor Enforcement. We sometimes refer to the defendants, collectively, as \"Maine\" or \"the State.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  We think it noteworthy that the plaintiffs have not challenged the importation limit, <i>see</i> Appellants' Br. at 15 n. 18, but, rather, treat it as aggravating the unconstitutional discrimination of which they complain. Because the plaintiffs have chosen to focus their challenge on the farm winery exception and the face-to-face sales requirement, we eschew any particularized analysis of the constitutionality of the importation limit.</p>\n<p>[3]  In mounting this argument, the plaintiffs attempt to distinguish between the cost attributable to the statutory requirements and any added expense that is attributable to geographic reality (for example, the fact that Oregon wine must be shipped cross-country in order to reach Maine consumers will inevitably add to its cost).</p>\n<p>[4]  Although the plaintiffs do not challenge Maine's four-quart importation limit, <i>see supra</i> note 2, they complain that their disadvantage is compounded by that limit. In practice, the importation limit prevents even committed wine collectors who are willing to travel from bringing home enough wine to justify the journey.</p>\n<p>[5]  The <i>Granholm</i> Court did express skepticism as to whether a ban on direct shipping furthers the goal of limiting the access of underage youths to alcohol. <i>See</i> 544 U.S. at 490, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142893\"><a href=\"/opinion/142893/granholm-v-heald/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1885</span></a></span>. Thus, were the plaintiffs able to carry their initial burden of putting forth substantial evidence showing an impermissibly discriminatory effect, <i>Granholm</i> might have more impact on other elements within the decisional calculus.</p>\n<p>[6]  The plaintiffs question the discussion in <i>Jelovsek,</i> presently pending on appeal before the Sixth Circuit, on the ground that the case was decided on the pleadings. Whatever the situation in <i>Jelovsek,</i> the plaintiffs here had ample opportunity to flesh out the record, yet they still have not been able to furnish probative evidence of discriminatory effect.</p>\n<p>[7]  Cherry Hill's complaint that it will be forced to establish off-site locations geographically closer to Maine consumers in order to attract Maine business appears in some sense to be a complaint about the effects of geography. Distance is not congruent with state lines, and the effects of geography alone do not constitute impermissible discrimination. An effect is not discriminatory, in violation of the dormant commerce clause, if it results from natural conditions. <i>See </i><i>Doran v. Mass. Turnpike Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200723\"><a href=\"/opinion/200723/doran-v-massachusetts-turn/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 319 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Grant's Dairy  Me., LLC v. Comm'r of Me. Dep't of Agric., Food &amp; Rural Res.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199150\"><a href=\"/opinion/199150/grants-dairy-maine-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.2000); <i>see also Baude,</i> Civ. No. 05-0735, at *27-28.</p>\n<p>[8]  To be sure, <i>Granholm</i> may reflect a retrenchment of the broad state power over the distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages that characterized earlier Supreme Court jurisprudence. But it does not appear, on the basis of <i>Granholm</i> alone, that a challenge can successfully be mounted to the three-tiered system. <i>See </i><i>Granholm,</i> 544 U.S. at 466, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142893\"><a href=\"/opinion/142893/granholm-v-heald/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1885</span></a></span> (reaffirming that \"States can mandate a three-tier distribution scheme in the exercise of their authority under the Twenty-first Amendment\"); <i>id.</i> at 493, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142893\"><a href=\"/opinion/142893/granholm-v-heald/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1885</span></a></span> (\"If a State chooses to allow direct shipment of wine, it must do so on evenhanded terms.\"); <i>see also</i> U.S. Const. amend. XXI. Any further step away from such a scheme is for the Supreme Court to take.</p>\n<p>[9]  In any event, this sortie smacks of an attack on the import limitation-and the plaintiffs have foresworn any direct attack on that limitation. <i>See supra</i> note 2. They cannot have their cake and eat it too.</p>\n\n</div>",
