Rudd has appealed an order of the\n\nUnited States Tax Court that dismissed his petition, purportedly\n\nfiled pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 6330(d), for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nWe review, de novo, legal interpretations of the Tax Court, such as\n\nthis jurisdictional determination.        See Capitol Video Corp. v.\n\nComm'r, 311 F.3d 458, 463 (1st Cir. 2002).      We affirm.\n\n            We conclude that the Tax Court correctly ruled that   its\n\njurisdiction under § 6330(d) depends upon the issuance of a valid\n\nnotice of determination by the IRS's Office of Appeals and the\n\nfiling of a timely petition for review. This jurisdictional ruling\n\nis in accord with the statutory language of § 6330(d) and is\n\nconsistent with prior tax court rulings and the Tax Court Rules of\n\nPractice and Procedure.    See, e.g., Moorhous v. Comm'r, 116 T.C.\n\n263, 269 (2001); Rule 330(b).          Rudd makes no cogent opposing\n\nargument.    Because the respondent Commissioner has not issued any\n\nnotice of determination with respect to Rudd's tax liability for\n\n1989, the Tax Court correctly dismissed Rudd's petition for lack of\n\njurisdiction.\n\n            The order of dismissal is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f",
