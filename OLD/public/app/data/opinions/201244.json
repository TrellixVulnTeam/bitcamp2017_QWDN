Packaging, Inc., d/b/a\n\nFox Packaging Co. (“Fox”), challenges a $300,000 judgment in favor\n\nof its former employee, Peter Massmanian. After a seven-day trial,\n\na jury found that Fox, a Minnesota-based manufacturer of windshield\n\nwasher fluid, used false promises to lure Massmanian away from a\n\ncomfortable job with a Massachusetts competitor.                Fox alleges a\n\nfailure of proof on critical elements of Massmanian's claim of\n\ndeceit and an absence of damages under a theory of mitigation.              We\n\naffirm.\n\n            In reviewing the district court's denial of Fox's motion\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law, we recite the relevant facts in\n\nthe light most favorable to the jury verdict.             Santos v. Sunrise\n\nMedical, Inc., 351 F.3d 587, 590 (1st Cir. 2003).              In 1997, Elliot\n\nBadzin, a co-owner of Fox, recruited Massmanian to oversee Fox's\n\noperations in Minnesota and California.         Massmanian testified that\n\nwhile negotiating his three-year employment contract with Fox,\n\nBadzin    discussed   the   possibility    of   opening    a    Massachusetts\n\nmanufacturing facility in a few years, and promised that Massmanian\n\nwould have an ownership interest in such a venture.                     Badzin\n\ndeclined to put his promise in writing, stating that it could\n\ncreate legal problems because Massmanian had a two-year non-compete\n\nagreement with his former employer in Massachusetts.             Massmanian’s\n\nemployment   contract   with   Fox   contemplated    that       his   severance\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fpackage and bonus would be eliminated “[w]hen and if the parties\n\nagree upon a plan for [Massmanian] to acquire stock” in Fox.\n\n               Massmanian   worked     for      Fox    a   few    years,     ultimately\n\noverseeing the operations of the Massachusetts facility when it\n\nopened in September 1999.          Massmanian repeatedly asked Badzin to\n\nfollow through on his promise to make him a partner in the\n\nMassachusetts venture.          Massmanian testified that Badzin told him\n\non   numerous     occasions     that   a     partnership         agreement    would     be\n\nforthcoming and that Massmanian would have a ten percent share. In\n\nJanuary    2001,     frustrated      by    Badzin’s        failure    to     proffer    a\n\npartnership agreement, Massmanian resigned.\n\n               In March 2001, Massmanian brought suit in Middlesex\n\nSuperior Court, alleging breach of contract and deceit.                                Fox\n\nremoved the case to federal court on the basis of diversity.                           28\n\nU.S.C.    §§    1332,   1441.     Following       a    seven-day      trial,    a   jury\n\nconcluded that there had been no enforceable contract between\n\nMassmanian and Fox, but that Fox had used intentional or reckless\n\nmisrepresentations to induce Massmanian to become an employee. The\n\njury awarded $300,000 to Massmanian.                  Fox appealed.\n\n               Fox contends that Massmanian failed to prove critical\n\nelements of his claim for deceit.                We will not disturb the jury\n\nverdict unless “the facts and inferences point so strongly and\n\noverwhelmingly in favor of the movant that a reasonable jury could\n\nnot have reached a verdict against that party.”                      Santos, 351 F.3d\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fat 590.    Our review is therefore weighted in favor of the jury’s\n\nverdict.\n\n              Fox alleges a dearth of record evidence demonstrating an\n\nintention to mislead.         Because the statement at issue here was\n\npromissory in nature, Massmanian bore the burden of proving that at\n\nthe time the promise was made, Fox (acting through Badzin) did not\n\nintend to carry it out.        See McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. v. Norton\n\nCo., 408 Mass. 704, 709 (1990); Barrett Assoc., Inc. v. Aronson,\n\n346 Mass. 150, 152 (1963).          A promise made with an intent to follow\n\nthrough is not actionable in deceit, even if the promise ultimately\n\ngoes unfulfilled.         See Palmacci v. Umpierrez, 121 F.3d 781, 787\n\n(1st   Cir.    1997).      Therefore,     under    Massachusetts    law,   mere\n\nnonperformance of a promise is not enough to prove a promisor’s\n\nintent to deceive.        Galotti v. United States Trust Co., 335 Mass.\n\n496, 501 (1957) (citing Restatement (First) of Torts § 530 cmt. c\n\n(1938)); Zhang v. Massachusetts Institute of Tech., 46 Mass. App.\n\nCt. 597, 605–06 (1999) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 530\n\n(1977)).\n\n              According to Fox, Massmanian’s only evidence of Fox’s\n\nintent to mislead was the fact that he never became a partner in\n\nthe Massachusetts venture.          We disagree.     At trial, Badzin denied\n\never promising      any    equity    interest   to   Massmanian.     The   jury\n\napparently rejected this critical testimony when it found that Fox\n\nintentionally      or     recklessly     made     representations   on     which\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fMassmanian relied.      The jury could have found that Badzin was not\n\ncredible; this would have been a relevant consideration where\n\nBadzin’s intention to follow through on his promise was at issue.\n\nOn these facts, a reasonable jury could have found that Badzin\n\nnever intended to make Massmanian a partner.\n\n           Fox also alleges that no reasonable jury could conclude\n\nthat   Massmanian     reasonably   relied       on   the   promise   of   future\n\npartnership.     It    argues   that     such    reliance    would   have     been\n\nunreasonable because it was contradicted by the plain language of\n\nMassmanian’s employment contract, which eliminated his severance\n\nbenefits and bonus “[w]hen and if the parties agree upon a plan for\n\n[Massmanian]   to   acquire     stock”    in    Fox.       This   language,    Fox\n\ncontends, “unambiguously states that the parties had reached no\n\nagreement regarding a stock ownership interest by Massmanian.”                  We\n\nnote the jury’s agreement with this interpretation to the extent\n\nthat it rejected Massmanian’s claim for breach of contract. But we\n\ncannot conclude that language like this in an employment contract\n\nforecloses any claim that a future partnership was promised.\n\nIndeed   the   language    suggests      that    the   parties     foresaw     the\n\npossibility of future partnership, but that there had not yet been\n\na meeting of the minds on the subject.           We find no conflict between\n\nthe written employment contract and the oral promise made to\n\nMassmanian that would have rendered his reliance unreasonable. Cf.\n\nTurner v. Johnson & Johnson, 809 F.2d 90, 97 (1st Cir. 1986)\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f(rejecting deceit claim where the alleged oral representation was\n\nflatly    inconsistent     with    a     contract     provision    specifically\n\naddressing the particular point at issue).\n\n            Fox further argues that any promise it made was too vague\n\nand indefinite to justify reasonable reliance because at the time\n\nBadzin was recruiting Massmanian, Badzin did not specify the size\n\nof the ownership interest Massmanian would receive.                      Indeed,\n\nMassmanian testified that no particular percentage was promised —\n\nhe simply expected that the partnership would be \"fair.\"                 We think\n\nthe promise is comparable to that made in Hurwitz v. Bocian, 41\n\nMass. App. Ct. 365, 373 (1996), where the defendant claimed that an\n\n\"unconfirmed oral promise that [the plaintiff] would some day have\n\nan opportunity to become a 'partner' . . . was not a promise on\n\nwhich a prudent person could reasonably rely.\"              The Massachusetts\n\nAppeals Court found that although the promise was not made in a\n\nmanner    that   satisfied   the       statute   of   frauds,     the   plaintiff\n\npresented sufficient evidence that a promise in fact had been made.\n\nId.   Fox attempts to distinguish this case on the ground that the\n\npromise    in    Hurwitz   was    one   of    equal   partnership,      thus   the\n\npercentage of the promised share was known.             But we think the jury\n\ncould have found that Fox promised Massmanian an interest in the\n\ncompany, and that whether the share ultimately offered was one\n\npercent or ninety-nine percent, Massmanian could have reasonably\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\frelied on the promise of some interest in agreeing to work for\n\nFox.1\n\n            Fox’s remaining argument is that Massmanian should not\n\nhave recovered any damages because after he left his employment\n\nwith Fox he secured a job and an equity interest in his new company\n\nworth far more than anything Badzin had ever promised him.                   Fox\n\ncontends that the district court failed properly to instruct the\n\njury on the issue of mitigation.              But Fox did not object to the\n\njury instructions as given, and we therefore review them only for\n\nplain error.    See Estate of Keatinge v. Biddle, 316 F.3d 7, 16 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).     Under this unforgiving standard, the party claiming\n\nerror must prove an error that is obvious, that likely affected the\n\noutcome, and     that   was    so    fundamental   that    it   threatened   the\n\nfairness,     integrity   or        public    reputation   of    the   judicial\n\nproceedings. See id. (citing United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725,\n\n\n\n        1\n      Fox also alleges that promises that Massmanian would receive\na ten percent share in the Massachusetts venture, which allegedly\nwere made around the time Massmanian's employment contract expired\nin 2000, were not actionable because Massmanian did not rely on\nthem to his detriment.    Massmanian had accepted a reduction in\nsalary at the time — a change he contends was made as part of an\nagreement that he would receive a share in the business. Fox argues\nthat because Massmanian had become an at-will employee, he was not\nentitled to any continued employment at all; therefore any decision\nto stay based on a promise of partnership could not have been to\nhis detriment.     Although we question whether this issue is\nnecessary to our affirmance of the judgment on the basis of the\nrepresentations made during Massmanian's recruitment, we think a\nreasonable jury could have found that these promises induced\nMassmanian to stay on at Fox and thereby refrain from exercising\nhis right to leave the company.\n\n                                        -7-\n\f735-36 (1993)); see also    United States v. Colon Osorio, 360 F.3d\n\n48, 52 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          The instruction proposed by Fox essentially told the jury\n\nthat if Massmanian, as a result of his departure from the company,\n\ngot a job whose stock incentive plan proved to be very lucrative,\n\nthen the damages from the deceitful promise should be automatically\n\ndisregarded. Whatever the correct state of the law on the tricky\n\nissue of windfall gains made possible by a prior wrongful act,\n\ntelling the jury that the wrongdoer automatically gets the benefit\n\ncannot be right. The refusal to give the requested instruction was\n\nnot error at all.     See United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 738\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).    (\"It is beyond peradventure that a trial court\n\nmay refuse to give a proposed instruction which is incorrect,\n\nmisleading, or incomplete in some material respect.\")\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",

We disagree.     At trial, Badzin denied\n\never promising      any    equity    interest   to   Massmanian.     The   jury\n\napparently rejected this critical testimony when it found that Fox\n\nintentionally      or     recklessly     made     representations   on     which\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fMassmanian relied.      The jury could have found that Badzin was not\n\ncredible; this would have been a relevant consideration where\n\nBadzin’s intention to follow through on his promise was at issue.\n\nOn these facts, a reasonable jury could have found that Badzin\n\nnever intended to make Massmanian a partner.\n\n           Fox also alleges that no reasonable jury could conclude\n\nthat   Massmanian     reasonably   relied       on   the   promise   of   future\n\npartnership.     It    argues   that     such    reliance    would   have     been\n\nunreasonable because it was contradicted by the plain language of\n\nMassmanian’s employment contract, which eliminated his severance\n\nbenefits and bonus “[w]hen and if the parties agree upon a plan for\n\n[Massmanian]   to   acquire     stock”    in    Fox.       This   language,    Fox\n\ncontends, “unambiguously states that the parties had reached no\n\nagreement regarding a stock ownership interest by Massmanian.”                  We\n\nnote the jury’s agreement with this interpretation to the extent\n\nthat it rejected Massmanian’s claim for breach of contract. But we\n\ncannot conclude that language like this in an employment contract\n\nforecloses any claim that a future partnership was promised.\n\nIndeed   the   language    suggests      that    the   parties     foresaw     the\n\npossibility of future partnership, but that there had not yet been\n\na meeting of the minds on the subject.           We find no conflict between\n\nthe written employment contract and the oral promise made to\n\nMassmanian that would have rendered his reliance unreasonable. Cf.\n\nTurner v. Johnson & Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481631\"><a href=\"/opinion/481631/robert-b-turner-v-johnson-johnson-robert-b-turner-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 97 (1st Cir. 1986)\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f(rejecting deceit claim where the alleged oral representation was\n\nflatly    inconsistent     with    a     contract     provision    specifically\n\naddressing the particular point at issue).\n\n            Fox further argues that any promise it made was too vague\n\nand indefinite to justify reasonable reliance because at the time\n\nBadzin was recruiting Massmanian, Badzin did not specify the size\n\nof the ownership interest Massmanian would receive.                      Indeed,\n\nMassmanian testified that no particular percentage was promised —\n\nhe simply expected that the partnership would be \"fair.\"                 We think\n\nthe promise is comparable to that made in Hurwitz v. Bocian, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mass. App. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 373 (1996), where the defendant claimed that an\n\n\"unconfirmed oral promise that [the plaintiff] would some day have\n\nan opportunity to become a 'partner' . . . was not a promise on\n\nwhich a prudent person could reasonably rely.\"              The Massachusetts\n\nAppeals Court found that although the promise was not made in a\n\nmanner    that   satisfied   the       statute   of   frauds,     the   plaintiff\n\npresented sufficient evidence that a promise in fact had been made.\n\nId.   Fox attempts to distinguish this case on the ground that the\n\npromise    in    Hurwitz   was    one   of    equal   partnership,      thus   the\n\npercentage of the promised share was known.             But we think the jury\n\ncould have found that Fox promised Massmanian an interest in the\n\ncompany, and that whether the share ultimately offered was one\n\npercent or ninety-nine percent, Massmanian could have reasonably\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\frelied on the promise of some interest in agreeing to work for\n\nFox.1\n\n            Fox’s remaining argument is that Massmanian should not\n\nhave recovered any damages because after he left his employment\n\nwith Fox he secured a job and an equity interest in his new company\n\nworth far more than anything Badzin had ever promised him.                   Fox\n\ncontends that the district court failed properly to instruct the\n\njury on the issue of mitigation.              But Fox did not object to the\n\njury instructions as given, and we therefore review them only for\n\nplain error.    See Estate of Keatinge v. Biddle, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).     Under this unforgiving standard, the party claiming\n\nerror must prove an error that is obvious, that likely affected the\n\noutcome, and     that   was    so    fundamental   that    it   threatened   the\n\nfairness,     integrity   or        public    reputation   of    the   judicial\n\nproceedings. See id. (citing United States v. Olano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n\n\n        1\n      Fox also alleges that promises that Massmanian would receive\na ten percent share in the Massachusetts venture, which allegedly\nwere made around the time Massmanian's employment contract expired\nin 2000, were not actionable because Massmanian did not rely on\nthem to his detriment.    Massmanian had accepted a reduction in\nsalary at the time — a change he contends was made as part of an\nagreement that he would receive a share in the business. Fox argues\nthat because Massmanian had become an at-will employee, he was not\nentitled to any continued employment at all; therefore any decision\nto stay based on a promise of partnership could not have been to\nhis detriment.     Although we question whether this issue is\nnecessary to our affirmance of the judgment on the basis of the\nrepresentations made during Massmanian's recruitment, we think a\nreasonable jury could have found that these promises induced\nMassmanian to stay on at Fox and thereby refrain from exercising\nhis right to leave the company.\n\n                                        -7-\n\f735-36 (1993)); see also    United States v.

Whatever the correct state of the law on the tricky\n\nissue of windfall gains made possible by a prior wrongful act,\n\ntelling the jury that the wrongdoer automatically gets the benefit\n\ncannot be right. The refusal to give the requested instruction was\n\nnot error at all.     See United States v.
