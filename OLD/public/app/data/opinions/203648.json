This appeal is from a summary\n\njudgment granted by the district court dismissing consolidated\n\nsuits1 filed by various participants in the W. R. Grace Retirement\n\nand Savings Plan (\"Plan\").2      These actions allege breach of the\n\nfiduciary duty owed appellants pursuant to the Employee Retirement\n\nIncome Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\").      29 U.S.C. §§ 1109, 1132.\n\nAppellants sued their employer and retirement fund manager, W.R.\n\nGrace & Co. (\"Grace\"), as well as their delegated fiduciary, State\n\nStreet Bank (\"State Street\").3    The latter was engaged by Grace to\n\nadvise it regarding the soundness of retaining certain stock assets\n\n\n1\n   Evans v. Akers, No. 04-11380 (D. Mass. filed June 17, 2004) and\nBunch v. W.R. Grace & Co., No. 05-11602 (D. Mass. filed Aug. 2,\n2005), consolidated into No. 04-11380 on May 18, 2006.         The\nprocedural history prior to consolidation is long and complicated,\nand mostly irrelevant to the merits of this appeal. Except where\nnecessary, it will be by-passed for present purposes. See Bunch v.\nW.R. Grace & Co., 532 F. Supp. 2d 283 (D. Mass. 2008).\n2\n  Certified as a class by the district court, comprising \"all W.R.\nGrace Stock Plan participants and entities who owned shares of W.R.\nGrace's publicly traded common stock through the Grace Stock Plan\nat any time from April 14, 2003, through April 30, 2004.\" The class\nis represented in this case by Lawrence Bunch, Jerry L. Howard,\nSr., David Mueller, and Keri Evans, hereinafter referred to\ncollectively as \"appellants\".\n3\n    In addition to Grace and State Street, individually named\ndefendants included the W.R.

In synthesis,\n\nappellants   claim   that   Grace    and   State   Street   breached   their\n\nfiduciary duty to appellants when State Street sold the Plan's\n\nholdings in Grace stock at an imprudently low price while Grace was\n\nin bankruptcy reorganization.         They claim that Grace failed to\n\nproperly monitor State Street in the performance of its delegated\n\nfiduciary duties. Because we conclude that the granting of summary\n\njudgment in favor of appellees was appropriate as a matter of law,\n\nwe affirm the decision of the district court.\n\n                               I. Facts4\n\n          Since at least 1976, Grace has sponsored the Plan, a\n\ndefined contribution 401(k) plan which offers participants an\n\nopportunity to invest wages in anticipation of retirement benefits.\n\nThe Plan was administered by the Investments and Benefits Committee\n\n(\"IBC\") composed of Grace officers.         The IBC was responsible for\n\nselecting and changing investment options offered under the Plan.\n\nEach Plan member, however, had the power to determine in which fund\n\nto invest at any given time.        The Plan offered participants twenty\n\n\n4\n   The parties stipulated to all the relevant facts, and thus the\ndistrict court decided the matter as a case stated. Bunch, 532 F.\nSupp. 2d at 285. We follow this lead and recite the facts based\nprincipally on the recompilation contained in the decision of the\ndistrict court. Id. at 285-86. These findings are binding upon us\nabsent clear error. Watson v. Deaconess Waltham Hosp., 298 F.3d\n102, 108 (1st Cir. 2002) (on review of a case stated, the district\ncourt's factual findings and any inferences drawn from the\nstipulated facts are subject to review only for clear error). The\ndistrict court's legal conclusions are, of course, subject to de\nnovo review. Id.\n\n                                     -4-\n\feight different options, including the Grace Stock Fund, which\n\ninvested in Grace stock.       The Grace Stock Fund owned approximately\n\n12% of Grace's outstanding shares.\n\n               Commencing in the 1970s, Grace, which was a global\n\nmanufacturer and supplier of catalysts and silica products, became\n\na   defendant     in   industry-wide    asbestos-related    personal     injury\n\nsuits.    Because of potential massive liability, on April 2, 2001,\n\nGrace filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11\n\nof the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the District of Delaware.5\n\n               In the meantime, from September 1999 until the bankruptcy\n\nproceedings were initiated in April 2001, the market price of Grace\n\nstock fell from approximately $19 per share to $1.50 per share.\n\nDuring this period, Grace continued to maintain the Grace Stock\n\nFund and to offer Grace stock as an investment option in the Plan.6\n\nThereafter,      while   the   bankruptcy    proceedings    continued    their\n\ncourse, and during the certified class period, the stock price more\n\nor less stabilized at between $2.00 to $5.00 per share.\n\n               On March 17, 2003, Brian McGowen, a member of the IBC,\n\nwrote    the    Plan's   participants    informing   them   that   the    Grace\n\nfiduciaries were \"seriously consider[ing]\" naming an independent\n\n\n\n5\n    See In re W.R. Grace, No. 01-01139 (Bankr. D. Del. filed\nApril 2, 2001).\n6\n   As so happens, the failure to divest under those circumstances\nwas itself the subject of a case before this court. See Evans v.\nAkers, 534 F.3d 65, 68 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                                       -5-\n\ffiduciary to operate the Grace Stock Fund in order to avoid any\n\npotential conflict of interest arising out of the reorganization\n\nplan in Grace's bankruptcy.   Thereafter, Grace proceeded to amend\n\nthe Plan to allow the IBC to appoint an independent investment\n\nmanager for the Grace Fund.   The amendment provided that:\n\n          [T]he Independent Investment Manager shall\n          have the following authority and duties:\n          . . .\n                 (i) the continuous authority and\n                 duty to determine the extent\n                 that the continued retention of\n                 shares of Grace Stock within the\n                 Grace    Stock   Fund   is   not\n                 inconsistent with the applicable\n                 provisions of [ERISA], and to\n                 take actions in this regard that\n                 it deems appropriate; including\n                 the authority to dispose of\n                 Grace Stock held within the\n                 Grace Stock Fund and to close\n                 the   Grace    Stock   Fund   to\n                 participant trading.\n\n          Pursuant to this provision, in December 2003, after due\n\ndeliberation, the IBC decided to resolve the potential conflict of\n\ninterest conundrum by appointing State Street as an independent\n\ninvestment   manager,   granting    it   the   powers   and   discretion\n\nauthorized by the amended Plan.      In this respect the independent\n\ninvestment manager was charged with determining the risks inherent\n\nin continued ownership of the Grace stock, including the extent of\n\nthe contingent asbestos litigation liability, an analysis that was\n\nitself partially dependent on assessing the likelihood of enactment\n\nby Congress of the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f2003.     S. 1125, 108th Cong. (2003) (designed to provide economic\n\nrelief to the litigation-ridden asbestos industry).\n\n            Upon its appointment, State Street itself proceeded to\n\nseek expert advice by retaining Duff and Phelps LLC (\"D&P\") for the\n\npurpose    of   obtaining    an    opinion    regarding   Grace's   financial\n\nprospects,      and   the   firm   of   Goodwin   Procter   LLP   to   provide\n\nappropriate legal counsel.         After due consideration, D&P prepared\n\na report that concluded that the value of Grace stock was between\n\n$0.73 and $3.02 per share, with a midpoint value of $1.88 per\n\nshare.     Considering that the approximate market price of Grace\n\nstock was $3.51 per share at that time, the State Street Fiduciary\n\nCommittee (\"Fiduciary Committee\"), charged with exercising the\n\ndiscretion assigned to State Street by Grace, entertained D&P's\n\nfindings and recommendations that the Grace stock be sold at its\n\nJanuary 2004 meeting.       The Fiduciary Committee, however, requested\n\nfurther findings.\n\n            Upon reconvening in February, the Fiduciary Committee\n\nconcluded that the Grace stock was an inappropriate investment\n\nbecause of the risks inherent to the price of the stock by reason\n\nof the potential liability extant in the continuing asbestos\n\nlitigation. Concomitantly, it also found that \"the market price of\n\nW.R. Grace stock [was] not a good indication of its long term\n\nvalue.\"     Thus, it decided that the best course to follow was to\n\nsell the Grace holdings on the open market.\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f              Before doing so, however, State Street gave advance\n\nnotice to Grace of its decision to begin selling the Plan's Grace\n\nstock.    It then notified the Plan's participants of its decision,\n\nbut advised them that, notwithstanding this decision, it would\n\n\"continue to monitor the situation\" and might decide to end the\n\nsales    effort   if   the     circumstances    required   it.     The    Grace\n\nfiduciaries did not question State Street about why it decided to\n\nsell    the   Plan's   Grace    stock,   in    part   because   Robert   Tarola\n\n(\"Tarola\") considered such inquiry \"off limits\" in view of the\n\nconflict of interest potential that led to delegation of the\n\nindependent power to act to State Street.\n\n              Relying in part on D&P's valuation of the stock, State\n\nStreet proceeded to sell 13% of its Grace stock holdings at between\n\n$2.86 and $3.09 per share.\n\n              Approximately a month or two later, an independent third\n\nparty investor, D.E. Shaw & Co.(\"Shaw\"), sought to buy the Plan's\n\nremaining Grace stock.         Shaw offered to buy this block at $3.50 per\n\nshare, although the stock was then selling at $2.96 per share.\n\nState Street informed Grace of the offer and asked Tarola if there\n\nwas anything that State Street should know about Grace before\n\nmaking a decision on this offer.         Tarola responded that everything\n\nthat State Street should know about Grace was available in the\n\npublic domain.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f             On April 12, 2004, State Street sold substantially all of\n\nthe Plan's holdings in Grace stock to Shaw at $3.50 per share, and\n\nnotified the Plan participants of its action.          The balance of the\n\nGrace stock was passed to Shaw one week later, on April 17, 2004.\n\n                              II. Discussion\n\n             Although packaged in a more legalistic wrapping, the\n\nessence of appellants' allegations of fiduciary misconduct by Grace\n\ncan be reduced to faulting Grace for its failure or refusal to\n\ninsert     itself   into State Street's decision-making process.       This\n\nmay   be   an   accurate   statement   of   Grace's   actions,   or   rather\n\ninactions; however, under the circumstances of this case, this did\n\nnot constitute a breach of Grace or State Street's fiduciary duties\n\nto appellants under ERISA.\n\n             A. The Decision of the District Court\n\n             Before the district court, appellants argued that because\n\nGrace's stock traded in an efficient market,7 absent evidence of\n\neminent collapse of the stock price, State Street ought to have\n\nrelied more heavily on market prediction of the stock's value, and\n\n\"Grace's solid potential in the future,\" before deciding to sell\n\n\n7\n  The efficient market theory hypothesizes that the best indicator\nof a stock's potential, as well as its risks and liabilities, is\nthe price at which it is traded in the open market. See In re\nXcelera.com Sec. Litig., 430 F.3d 503, 508 (1st Cir. 2005)\n(discussing the efficient market theory in a securities case, and\nexplaining that \"'an efficient market is one in which the market\nprice of the stock fully reflects all publicly available\ninformation.'\" (quoting In re PolyMedica Corp. Sec. Litig., 432\nF.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 2005))).\n\n                                   -9-\n\fthe Grace stock portfolio.        Bunch, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 287.    Rather\n\nthan selling this stock, appellants contended that the efficient\n\nmarket theory established that the only action consistent with\n\nERISA was the retention of the Grace stock.       Id.   Because the Grace\n\nstock was traded in an efficient market, placing a different price\n\nthan the market price into the valuation process, as was done by\n\nState Street, constituted \"second guessing\" the market and thus,\n\naccording to appellants, imprudent fiduciary conduct.            Appellees\n\ndid not dispute that Grace stock traded in an efficient market but\n\nin contravention to appellants' position, Grace argued that the\n\ncurrent market price of Grace stock constituted only one of the\n\nfactors that a prudent fiduciary under ERISA needed to consider in\n\ndeciding whether to retain or divest the stock from its portfolio.\n\n            The district court agreed that \"the market was the best\n\nindicator    of   the   stock's   present   value.\"     Id.   (emphasis   in\n\noriginal).    Nevertheless, it rejected appellants' notion that the\n\nefficient market was the standard by which the court should measure\n\nState Street's actions.       The court concluded that the applicable\n\nstandard was ERISA's prudent person standard.         It ruled that ERISA\n\ndid not require that a fiduciary maximize the value of investments,\n\nas Appellants seemed to imply by their arguments.             Rather, what\n\nERISA calls for from a fiduciary is that it use the \"care, skill,\n\nprudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing\n\nthat a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fmatters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like\n\ncharacter and with like aims.\"        29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(B).      As the\n\ndistrict court aptly stated, \"in common parlance, [what] ERISA\n\nfiduciaries owe participants [are] duties of prudence and loyalty,\"\n\nBunch, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 288 (citing Moench v. Robertson, 62 F.3d\n\n553, 561 (3d Cir. 1995)).        The district court noted that other\n\ncourts faced with allegations similar to those of appellants in\n\nthis case had looked at the totality of the circumstances involved\n\nin the particular transaction. Id. Among the key decisions relied\n\nupon   by   the   district   court   for    reaching   this   conclusion   was\n\nDiFelice v. U.S. Airways, Inc., in which that court stated:\n\n            [W]e    examine    the   totality    of    the\n            circumstances, including, but not limited to:\n            the plan structure and aims, the disclosures\n            made to participants regarding the general and\n            specific risks associated with investment in\n            company stock, and the nature and extent of\n            challenges facing the company that would have\n            an effect on stock price and viability.\n\n497 F.3d 410, 418 (4th Cir. 2007).\n\n            Thus, the district court concluded, the relevant inquiry\n\nwas not whether the market price was the best predictor of share\n\nvalue, as claimed by appellants, but whether State Street took into\n\naccount all relevant information in carrying out its fiduciary\n\nduties under ERISA.     Bunch, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 288.          The district\n\ncourt then enumerated the various factors considered by State\n\nStreet, in addition to the D&P report, in making its divestment\n\ndecision, namely: the market price of the stock, information about\n\n                                     -11-\n\fthe Plan, the bankruptcy proceedings, the financial outlook of the\n\ncompany, and the potential liability by reason of the asbestos\n\nlitigation. State Street's analysis of these factors convinced the\n\ndistrict court that there was a potential for loss of value of the\n\nGrace stock which was comparable to knowledge of an impending\n\ncollapse, a conclusion which negated the presumption that retention\n\nof company stock was prudent under ERISA.         Id. at 289; see also\n\nMoench, 62 F.3d at 572.   In any event, as the district court noted,\n\nbecause the shares in question were sold at a higher price than the\n\nthen-existing market price, the best that appellants could claim\n\nwas that they could have earned more money had State Street not\n\nsold the Grace shares until a later date.       The district court ruled\n\nthat the test was not whether the best possible action was taken by\n\nState Street, but whether it had considered all relevant factors at\n\nthe time of the divestment decision.      Id. at 290.\n\n          Although appellants exert strenuous efforts to have us\n\nconclude otherwise, we can find little to disagree with in the\n\ndecision of the district court.      We are nevertheless duty bound to\n\nconsider appellants' contentions before us.\n\n          B. The Case on Appeal\n\n          On   appeal   appellants    present    us   with   two   general\n\ncomplaints regarding the decision of the district court: first,\n\nthey allege \"misapplication\" of the law concerning the presumption\n\nthat the retention of company stock in a retirement plan is\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fconsistent with ERISA, and second, they claim error in the district\n\ncourt's \"mistaken\" equation of State Street's process for deciding\n\nto   sell   the   Grace   stock,    which   the   court   said   \"took   into\n\nconsideration the totality of circumstances surrounding [said]\n\nstock,\" with a substantively sound and reasoned analysis of all\n\nrelevant circumstances. Id. We shall discuss these contentions in\n\ninverse order of presentation because resolution of the second\n\nclaimed error easily disposes of the first alleged fault.\n\n            Considering the thorough investigative and decisional\n\nprocess that preceded the divestment of the Grace stock by the\n\nfiduciaries in this case, it is difficult, indeed impossible, given\n\nthe standard of review which we are bound to follow, to legally\n\nchallenge their actions in this appeal.           Notwithstanding the re-\n\nframing of the issues before us, as stated above, it is clear from\n\na reading of appellants' briefs that they continue to base their\n\ncontentions of breach of fiduciary duty by State Street on the\n\nmistaken application of the efficient market theory to the facts of\n\nthis case, a contention that was rejected by the district court.\n\nSpecifically, this contention is the erroneously framed argument\n\nthat State Street breached its duty by not giving sufficient weight\n\nto the market price in determining the value of the Grace stock.\n\n            Reiterating what was decided by the district court, this\n\nposition is plainly wrong.         As cogently stated by that court, the\n\nefficient market is not the standard by which State Street's\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\factions are to be judged.            Rather, under ERISA, a fiduciary is\n\nrequired to act with \"'the care, skill, prudence and diligence\n\n. . . that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar\n\nwith such matters would use.'\" Beddall v. State St. Bank & Trust\n\nCo.,   137    F.3d    12,   18   (1st    Cir.    1998)      (quoting    29   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1104(a)(1)(B)).      \"[T]he test of prudence -- the Prudent Man Rule\n\n-- is one of conduct, and not a test of the result of performance\n\nof the investment.\"         Donovan v. Cunningham, 716 F.2d 1455, 1467\n\n(5th   Cir.   1983)    (emphasis     added)     (quotation      marks    omitted).\n\n\"[W]hether a fiduciary's actions are prudent cannot be measured in\n\nhindsight . . . .\" DiFelice, 497 F.3d at 424.                The \"test [is] how\n\nthe fiduciary acted viewed from the perspective of the time of the\n\nchallenged     decision     rather    than     from   the    vantage    point   of\n\nhindsight.\" Roth v. Sawyer-Cleator Lumber Co., 16 F.3d 915, 917-18\n\n(8th Cir. 1994) (quotation marks omitted).               Furthermore, prudence\n\n\"involves a balancing of competing interests under conditions of\n\nuncertainty.\" Armstrong v. LaSalle Bank Nat'l Ass'n, 446 F.3d 728,\n\n733 (7th Cir. 2006).          Rather than emphasizing one factor, the\n\nmarket price, as proposed by appellants, State Street correctly\n\nconsidered \"the totality of the circumstances,\" including, of\n\ncourse, the market price of the Grace stock.                  See DiFelice, 497\n\nF.3d at 418; Keach v. U.S. Trust Co., 419 F.3d 626, 636-37 (7th\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\f               Under the circumstances of this case, the actions of both\n\nGrace and State Street, with relation to the divestment of the\n\nGrace stock held by the Plan, unquestionably meet the prudent man\n\nstandard embodied in ERISA.\n\n               First of all, upon concluding that the decisions required\n\nof     Grace    management    in   connection    with    the   reorganization\n\nproceedings augured a potential conflict of interest with Grace's\n\nfiduciary duties, Grace took the eminently correct decision of\n\ninsulating itself from that possibility.                It amended the Plan,\n\nafter duly notifying the participants of its intended action and\n\nnotifying them of the reasons for its action.               It then delegated\n\nthe relevant decisional power to an independent third party, State\n\nStreet, to render its expert, unbiased assessment of the Grace\n\nstock, and to execute its autonomous determination based on its\n\nconclusion regarding whether the Fund's retention or sale of Grace\n\nstock was appropriate.          See 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1) (requiring a\n\nfiduciary to act \"solely in the interest of the participants and\n\nbeneficiaries\").        State Street itself sought further assessment\n\nfrom    two    non-partisan    professional     entities,   D&P    and   Goodwin\n\nProcter       LLP,   whose   expertise   in   their   respective    fields   of\n\nknowledge is not questioned by appellants.\n\n               State Street, as well as these two firms, in addition to\n\nclosely monitoring the price fluctuations of the Grace stock on the\n\nmarket, compiled and studied Grace's financial performance and\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\foutlook, in particular analyzing how developments in the Grace\n\nbankruptcy and the process of reorganization could impact the value\n\nof Grace's common stock.   Of prime importance was whether Grace's\n\ncontingent asbestos liabilities in the bankruptcy could approach or\n\nexceed the value of equity in the company, thus diluting or\n\naltogether wiping out the value of the Grace stock in the Plan's\n\nportfolio.   Among the factors considered by the State Street team\n\nat the various meetings and conferences regarding the asbestos\n\ncontingent liability were: (1) the asbestos-related bodily injury\n\nclaims being filed and pending against Grace; (2) the outcome of\n\nclass action litigation pending against Grace regarding a product\n\ncalled Zonolite attic insulation material; (3) the availability of\n\ninsurance coverage to pay asbestos claims; and (4) the probability\n\nof passage of legislation pending in Congress, the Fairness in\n\nAsbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2003, which, if enacted, could\n\nreduce or cap Grace's liability for asbestos bodily injury claims.\n\n          Thereafter, based on its investigations and analysis of\n\nthe facts that it found, D&P prepared and presented to State Street\n\na detailed 88-page financial and valuation analysis of Grace, which\n\nincluded a determination of what it considered \"a reasonable\n\npricing range for the [Grace] stock given the factors we believe\n\nshould impact the value to equity investors.\"      Based on these\n\nfactors, the recommendation was made to State Street to commence\n\nselling the Grace stock holdings.     Nevertheless, the Fiduciary\n\n\n                               -16-\n\fCommittee requested further analysis from its advisors, which led\n\nto additional meetings and a further formal presentation, attended\n\nby representatives of both D&P and Goodwin Procter LLP.            At this\n\npresentation, a summary was made of the due diligence and analysis\n\nto   date,     which   included     the    following   summary     of    its\n\nrecommendation:\n\n             Unresolved asbestos litigation and potential\n             asbestos    legislation    will   affect   the\n             determination of whether Grace stock remains\n             a prudent investment.     The uncertainty and\n             consequence of unfavorable events occurring as\n             a result of litigation probabilities or of\n             legislation not being enacted timely or at\n             all, has resulted in the IFG8 recommendation\n             that the Committee override Plan documentation\n             and begin to reduce the holdings of Grace\n             stock.\n\n             The recommendation to commence a selling\n             program is based upon the IFG's determination\n             that the continued holding by the Trust of all\n             of its shares of Grace stock would be\n             imprudent and therefore inconsistent with the\n             requirements of Section 404(a)(1)(B) of ERISA.\n             Such determination reflects the input of [D&P]\n             and Goodwin [Procter LLP] and has been made\n             after careful consideration of all of the\n             facts and circumstances determined to be\n             relevant by IFG.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n             Thereafter,   the    Fiduciary   Committee   met    again   and\n\nunanimously approved this recommendation, establishing as a minimum\n\nsales price the midpoint valuation range found by D&P of $1.88 per\n\n\n8\n   \"IFG\" refers to State Street's Independent Fiduciary Group,\nitself composed of investment professionals experienced in managing\ncompany stock funds for ERISA-covered pension plans.\n\n                                    -17-\n\fshare.     The divestment decision was communicated to the Plan's\n\nparticipants, who were also informed that the situation would\n\ncontinue to be monitored in case a change in strategy became\n\nnecessary by reason of changed circumstances.\n\n            Between February 25 and April 6, 2004, State Street sold\n\napproximately 900,000 shares of Grace stock in the open market\n\ntransactions at then-prevailing New York Stock Exchange trading\n\nprices, ranging from $2.86 to $3.00 per share. During this period,\n\nState Street continued to monitor the Grace stock and received\n\nregular updates from D&P regarding its equity valuation conclusion\n\nfor Grace.\n\n            On April 2, 2004, Shaw, an independent investor, made\n\nState Street an unsolicited offer to purchase the remaining 6.2\n\nmillion shares of Grace stock still in the Plan's portfolio.                The\n\noffer was for the entire lot at $3.50 per share, which was 8%\n\nhigher than the closing price of $3.24 per share on April 1, and\n\nalmost twice the mid-point equity valuation of $1.36 per share\n\nassessed    by   D&P    as   of   March    31,   2004.     In   the    meantime,\n\ndevelopments     in    the   proposed     legislative    settlements   required\n\nfurther investigation by D&P and additional meetings with State\n\nStreet, but ultimately it was concluded that there was no further\n\nneed for D&P to re-evaluate the equity valuation for Grace.                This\n\nhiatus led to Shaw lowering its offer to $3.25 per share, after\n\nwhich Goodwin Procter LLP advised the Fiduciary Committee on recent\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fevents regarding Grace's exposure to asbestos liabilities.           The\n\nFiduciary Committee reaffirmed the basis for its conclusion that\n\nGrace stock was an inappropriate investment for the Plan because of\n\nthe factors already considered, including the bankruptcy status of\n\nthe company, the uncertainty that equity holders would receive\n\nvalue for the stock, and the outstanding asbestos litigation.        The\n\nfundamentals regarding the Grace stock remaining unaltered from\n\nwhen   the    question   was   previously   considered,   the   Fiduciary\n\nCommittee voted unanimously to sell the remaining shares to Shaw\n\nprovided that the original offer price of $3.50 was reinstated and\n\nthat the sale did not burden the Plan with any commission expenses.\n\nThe sale to Shaw was effectuated in two transactions, on April 12\n\nand 19, 2004, at $3.50 per share, approximately 18% higher than the\n\nmarket closing price on those dates.\n\n             There can be little doubt on this record that the state\n\nof Grace's corporate health was thoroughly studied by experts who\n\ndebated and considered ad nauseam the pros and cons of retaining or\n\nselling the stock held in the Plan's portfolio.           The unanimous\n\nconclusion of those charged with making the decision was that\n\ndivestment of this stock was the only action consistent with the\n\nprudence required of a responsible fiduciary under ERISA.         Without\n\nquestion, State Street engaged in a substantively sound, reasonable\n\nanalysis of all relevant circumstances appropriate to the decision\n\n\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fto sell the Grace stock.       We cannot say that the district court's\n\napproval of these actions was in error.\n\n           Appellants seek to induce us to reject State Street's\n\nactions by having us apply a presumption of prudence which is\n\nafforded fiduciaries when they decide to retain an employer's stock\n\nin falling markets, first articulated in Kuper v. Iovenko, 66 F.3d\n\n1447, 1459 (6th Cir. 1995) and Moench, 62 F.3d at 571-72.                 The\n\npresumption favoring retention in a \"stock drop\" case serves as a\n\nshield for a prudent fiduciary.       If applied verbatim in a case such\n\nas our own, the purpose of the presumption is controverted and the\n\nstandard transforms into a sword to be used against the prudent\n\nfiduciary.      This presumption has not been so applied, and we\n\ndecline to do so here, as it would effectively lead us to judge a\n\nfiduciary's actions in hindsight.           Although hindsight is 20/20, as\n\nwe have already stated, that is not the lens by which we view a\n\nfiduciary's actions under ERISA.        DiFelice, 497 F.3d at 424; Roth,\n\n16 F.3d at 917-18.      Rather, given the situation which faced it,\n\nbased on the facts then known, State Street made an assessment\n\nafter appropriate and thorough investigation of Grace's condition.\n\nKatsaros   v.   Cody,   744   F.2d   270,    279   (2d   Cir.   1984).9   This\n\n\n9\n   A fiduciary charged with making investment decisions on behalf\nof an ERISA plan is required (1) to \"employ[] the appropriate\nmethods to investigate the merits of the investment and to\nstructure the investment;\" (2) to \"act[] in a like capacity [of\nothers] familiar with such matters;\" and (3) to conduct an\n\"independent investigation of the merits of a particular\ninvestment\", id. (quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                     -20-\n\fassessment led it to find that there was a real possibility that\n\nthis stock could very well become of little value or even worthless\n\nto the Plan.   It is this prudent assessment, and not a presumption\n\nof   retention,    applicable   in   another       context   entirely,   which\n\ncontrols the disposition of this case.

Conclusion\n\n           The decision of the district court is affirmed.\n\n           Costs are imposed on appellants.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\f",

Grace Retirement and Savings Plan (\"Plan\").<sup>[2]</sup> These actions allege breach of the fiduciary duty owed appellants pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"). 29 U.S.C. §§ 1109, 1132. Appellants sued their employer and retirement fund manager, W.R. Grace &amp; Co. (\"Grace\"), as well as their delegated fiduciary, State Street Bank (\"State Street\").<sup>[3]</sup> The latter was engaged by Grace to advise it regarding the soundness of retaining certain stock assets of the Plan and to act independently on said advice. In synthesis, appellants claim that Grace and State Street breached their fiduciary duty to appellants when State Street sold the Plan's holdings in Grace stock at an imprudently low price while Grace was in bankruptcy reorganization. They claim that Grace failed to properly monitor State Street in the performance of its delegated fiduciary duties. Because we conclude that the granting of summary judgment in favor of appellees was appropriate as a matter of law, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Facts</i><sup>[4]</sup></h2>\n<p>Since at least 1976, Grace has sponsored the Plan, a defined contribution 401(k) plan which offers participants an opportunity to invest wages in anticipation of retirement benefits. The Plan was administered by the Investments and Benefits Committee (\"IBC\") composed of Grace officers. The IBC was responsible for selecting and changing investment options offered under the Plan. Each Plan member, however, had the power to determine in which fund to invest at any given time. The Plan offered participants twenty eight different options, including the Grace Stock Fund, which invested in Grace stock. The Grace Stock Fund owned approximately 12% of Grace's outstanding shares.</p>\n<p>Commencing in the 1970s, Grace, which was a global manufacturer and supplier of catalysts and silica products, became a defendant in industry-wide asbestos-related personal injury suits. Because of potential massive liability, on April 2, 2001, Grace filed voluntary petitions for reorganization <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the District of Delaware.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>In the meantime, from September 1999 until the bankruptcy proceedings were initiated in April 2001, the market price of Grace stock fell from approximately $19 per share to $1.50 per share. During this period, Grace continued to maintain the Grace Stock Fund and to offer Grace stock as an investment option in the Plan.<sup>[6]</sup> Thereafter, while the bankruptcy proceedings continued their course, and during the certified class period, the stock price more or less stabilized at between $2.00 to $5.00 per share.</p>\n<p>On March 17, 2003, Brian McGowen, a member of the IBC, wrote the Plan's participants informing them that the Grace fiduciaries were \"seriously consider[ing]\" naming an independent fiduciary to operate the Grace Stock Fund in order to avoid any potential conflict of interest arising out of the reorganization plan in Grace's bankruptcy. Thereafter, Grace proceeded to amend the Plan to allow the IBC to appoint an independent investment manager for the Grace Fund. The amendment provided that:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he Independent Investment Manager shall have the following authority and duties:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(i) the continuous authority and duty to determine the extent that the continued retention of shares of Grace Stock within the Grace Stock Fund is not inconsistent with the applicable provisions of [ERISA], and to take actions in this regard that it deems appropriate; including the authority to dispose of Grace Stock held within the Grace Stock Fund and to close the Grace Stock Fund to participant trading.</blockquote>\n<p>Pursuant to this provision, in December 2003, after due deliberation, the IBC decided to resolve the potential conflict of interest conundrum by appointing State Street as an independent investment manager, granting it the powers and discretion authorized by the amended Plan. In this respect the independent investment manager was charged with determining the risks inherent in continued ownership of the Grace stock, including the extent of the contingent asbestos litigation liability, an analysis that was itself partially dependent on assessing the likelihood of enactment by Congress of the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2003. S. 1125, 108th Cong. (2003) (designed to provide economic relief to the litigation-ridden asbestos industry).</p>\n<p>Upon its appointment, State Street itself proceeded to seek expert advice by retaining Duff and Phelps LLC (\"D &amp; P\") for the purpose of obtaining an opinion regarding Grace's financial prospects, and the firm of Goodwin Procter LLP to provide appropriate legal counsel. After due consideration, D &amp; P prepared a report that concluded that the value of Grace stock was between $0.73 and $3.02 per share, with a midpoint value of $1.88 per share. Considering that the approximate market price of Grace stock was $3.51 per share at that time, the State Street Fiduciary Committee (\"Fiduciary Committee\"), charged with exercising the discretion assigned to State Street by Grace, entertained D &amp; P's findings and recommendations that the Grace stock be sold at its January 2004 meeting. The Fiduciary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> Committee, however, requested further findings.</p>\n<p>Upon reconvening in February, the Fiduciary Committee concluded that the Grace stock was an inappropriate investment because of the risks inherent to the price of the stock by reason of the potential liability extant in the continuing asbestos litigation. Concomitantly, it also found that \"the market price of W.R. Grace stock [was] not a good indication of its long term value.\" Thus, it decided that the best course to follow was to sell the Grace holdings on the open market.</p>\n<p>Before doing so, however, State Street gave advance notice to Grace of its decision to begin selling the Plan's Grace stock. It then notified the Plan's participants of its decision, but advised them that, notwithstanding this decision, it would \"continue to monitor the situation\" and might decide to end the sales effort if the circumstances required it. The Grace fiduciaries did not question State Street about why it decided to sell the Plan's Grace stock, in part because Robert Tarola (\"Tarola\") considered such inquiry \"off limits\" in view of the conflict of interest potential that led to delegation of the independent power to act to State Street.</p>\n<p>Relying in part on D &amp; P's valuation of the stock, State Street proceeded to sell 13% of its Grace stock holdings at between $2.86 and $3.09 per share.</p>\n<p>Approximately a month or two later, an independent third party investor, D.E. Shaw &amp; Co.(\"Shaw\"), sought to buy the Plan's remaining Grace stock. Shaw offered to buy this block at $3.50 per share, although the stock was then selling at $2.96 per share. State Street informed Grace of the offer and asked Tarola if there was anything that State Street should know about Grace before making a decision on this offer. Tarola responded that everything that State Street should know about Grace was available in the public domain.</p>\n<p>On April 12, 2004, State Street sold substantially all of the Plan's holdings in Grace stock to Shaw at $3.50 per share, and notified the Plan participants of its action. The balance of the Grace stock was passed to Shaw one week later, on April 17, 2004.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Although packaged in a more legalistic wrapping, the essence of appellants' allegations of fiduciary misconduct by Grace can be reduced to faulting Grace for its failure or refusal to insert itself into State Street's decision-making process. This may be an accurate statement of Grace's actions, or rather inactions; however, under the circumstances of this case, this did not constitute a breach of Grace or State Street's fiduciary duties to appellants under ERISA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Decision of the District Court</h2>\n<p>Before the district court, appellants argued that because Grace's stock traded in an efficient market,<sup>[7]</sup> absent evidence of eminent collapse of the stock price, State Street ought to have relied more heavily on market prediction of the stock's value, and \"Grace's solid potential in the future,\" before deciding to sell the Grace stock portfolio. <i>Bunch,</i> 532 F.Supp.2d at 287. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> Rather than selling this stock, appellants contended that the efficient market theory established that the <i>only</i> action consistent with ERISA was the retention of the Grace stock. <i>Id.</i> Because the Grace stock was traded in an efficient market, placing a different price than the market price into the valuation process, as was done by State Street, constituted \"second guessing\" the market and thus, according to appellants, imprudent fiduciary conduct. Appellees did not dispute that Grace stock traded in an efficient market but in contravention to appellants' position, Grace argued that the current market price of Grace stock constituted only one of the factors that a prudent fiduciary under ERISA needed to consider in deciding whether to retain or divest the stock from its portfolio.</p>\n<p>The district court agreed that \"the market was the best indicator of the stock's <i>present</i> value.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original). Nevertheless, it rejected appellants' notion that the efficient market was the standard by which the court should measure State Street's actions. The court concluded that the applicable standard was ERISA's prudent person standard. It ruled that ERISA did not require that a fiduciary maximize the value of investments, as Appellants seemed to imply by their arguments. Rather, what ERISA calls for from a fiduciary is that it use the \"care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(B). As the district court aptly stated, \"in common parlance, [what] ERISA fiduciaries owe participants [are] duties of prudence and loyalty,\" <i>Bunch,</i> 532 F.Supp.2d at 288 (citing <i>Moench v. Robertson,</i> 62 F.3d 553, 561 (3d Cir.1995)). The district court noted that other courts faced with allegations similar to those of appellants in this case had looked at the totality of the circumstances involved in the particular transaction. <i>Id.</i> Among the key decisions relied upon by the district court for reaching this conclusion was <i>DiFelice v. U.S. Airways, Inc.,</i> in which that court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>[W]e examine the totality of the circumstances, including, but not limited to: the plan structure and aims, the disclosures made to participants regarding the general and specific risks associated with investment in company stock, and the nature and extent of challenges facing the company that would have an effect on stock price and viability.</blockquote>\n<p>497 F.3d 410, 418 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Thus, the district court concluded, the relevant inquiry was not whether the market price was the best predictor of share value, as claimed by appellants, but whether State Street took into account all relevant information in carrying out its fiduciary duties under ERISA. <i>Bunch,</i> 532 F.Supp.2d at 288. The district court then enumerated the various factors considered by State Street, in addition to the D &amp; P report, in making its divestment decision, namely: the market price of the stock, information about the Plan, the bankruptcy proceedings, the financial outlook of the company, and the potential liability by reason of the asbestos litigation. State Street's analysis of these factors convinced the district court that there was a potential for loss of value of the Grace stock which was comparable to knowledge of an impending collapse, a conclusion which negated the presumption that retention of company stock was prudent under ERISA. <i>Id.</i> at 289; <i>see also </i><i>Moench,</i> 62 F.3d at 572. In any event, as the district court noted, because the shares in question were sold at a higher price than the then-existing market price, the best that appellants <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> could claim was that they could have earned more money had State Street not sold the Grace shares until a later date. The district court ruled that the test was not whether the best possible action was taken by State Street, but whether it had considered all relevant factors at the time of the divestment decision. <i>Id.</i> at 290.</p>\n<p>Although appellants exert strenuous efforts to have us conclude otherwise, we can find little to disagree with in the decision of the district court. We are nevertheless duty bound to consider appellants' contentions before us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Case on Appeal</h2>\n<p>On appeal appellants present us with two general complaints regarding the decision of the district court: first, they allege \"misapplication\" of the law concerning the presumption that the retention of company stock in a retirement plan is consistent with ERISA, and second, they claim error in the district court's \"mistaken\" equation of State Street's process for deciding to sell the Grace stock, which the court said \"took into consideration the totality of circumstances surrounding [said] stock,\" with a substantively sound and reasoned analysis of all relevant circumstances. <i>Id.</i> We shall discuss these contentions in inverse order of presentation because resolution of the second claimed error easily disposes of the first alleged fault.</p>\n<p>Considering the thorough investigative and decisional process that preceded the divestment of the Grace stock by the fiduciaries in this case, it is difficult, indeed impossible, given the standard of review which we are bound to follow, to legally challenge their actions in this appeal. Notwithstanding the re-framing of the issues before us, as stated above, it is clear from a reading of appellants' briefs that they continue to base their contentions of breach of fiduciary duty by State Street on the mistaken application of the efficient market theory to the facts of this case, a contention that was rejected by the district court. Specifically, this contention is the erroneously framed argument that State Street breached its duty by not giving sufficient weight to the market price in determining the value of the Grace stock.</p>\n<p>Reiterating what was decided by the district court, this position is plainly wrong. As cogently stated by that court, the efficient market is not the standard by which State Street's actions are to be judged. Rather, under ERISA, a fiduciary is required to act with \"`the care, skill, prudence and diligence ... that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use.'\" <i>Beddall v. State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 137 F.3d 12, 18 (1st Cir.1998) (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(B)). \"[T]he test of prudence  the Prudent Man Rule  is one of <i>conduct,</i> and not a test of the result of performance of the investment.\" <i>Donovan v. Cunningham,</i> 716 F.2d 1455, 1467 (5th Cir.1983) (emphasis added) (quotation marks omitted). \"[W]hether a fiduciary's actions are prudent cannot be measured in hindsight. ...\" <i>DiFelice,</i> 497 F.3d at 424. The \"test [is] how the fiduciary acted viewed from the perspective of the time of the challenged decision rather than from the vantage point of hindsight.\" <i>Roth v. Sawyer-Cleator Lumber Co.,</i> 16 F.3d 915, 917-18 (8th Cir.1994) (quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, prudence \"involves a balancing of competing interests under conditions of uncertainty.\" <i>Armstrong v. LaSalle Bank Nat'l Ass'n,</i> 446 F.3d 728, 733 (7th Cir.2006). Rather than emphasizing one factor, the market price, as proposed by appellants, State Street correctly considered \"the totality of the circumstances,\" including, of course, the market price of the Grace stock. <i>See DiFelice,</i> 497 F.3d at 418; <i>Keach v. U.S.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> <i>Trust Co.,</i> 419 F.3d 626, 636-37 (7th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p>Under the circumstances of this case, the actions of both Grace and State Street, with relation to the divestment of the Grace stock held by the Plan, unquestionably meet the prudent man standard embodied in ERISA.</p>\n<p>First of all, upon concluding that the decisions required of Grace management in connection with the reorganization proceedings augured a potential conflict of interest with Grace's fiduciary duties, Grace took the eminently correct decision of insulating itself from that possibility. It amended the Plan, after duly notifying the participants of its intended action and notifying them of the reasons for its action. It then delegated the relevant decisional power to an independent third party, State Street, to render its expert, unbiased assessment of the Grace stock, and to execute its autonomous determination based on its conclusion regarding whether the Fund's retention or sale of Grace stock was appropriate. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1) (requiring a fiduciary to act \"solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries\"). State Street itself sought further assessment from two non-partisan professional entities, D &amp; P and Goodwin Procter LLP, whose expertise in their respective fields of knowledge is not questioned by appellants.</p>\n<p>State Street, as well as these two firms, in addition to closely monitoring the price fluctuations of the Grace stock on the market, compiled and studied Grace's financial performance and outlook, in particular analyzing how developments in the Grace bankruptcy and the process of reorganization could impact the value of Grace's common stock. Of prime importance was whether Grace's contingent asbestos liabilities in the bankruptcy could approach or exceed the value of equity in the company, thus diluting or altogether wiping out the value of the Grace stock in the Plan's portfolio. Among the factors considered by the State Street team at the various meetings and conferences regarding the asbestos contingent liability were: (1) the asbestos-related bodily injury claims being filed and pending against Grace; (2) the outcome of class action litigation pending against Grace regarding a product called Zonolite attic insulation material; (3) the availability of insurance coverage to pay asbestos claims; and (4) the probability of passage of legislation pending in Congress, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2003, which, if enacted, could reduce or cap Grace's liability for asbestos bodily injury claims.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, based on its investigations and analysis of the facts that it found, D &amp; P prepared and presented to State Street a detailed 88-page financial and valuation analysis of Grace, which included a determination of what it considered \"a reasonable pricing range for the [Grace] stock given the factors we believe should impact the value to equity investors.\" Based on these factors, the recommendation was made to State Street to commence selling the Grace stock holdings. Nevertheless, the Fiduciary Committee requested further analysis from its advisors, which led to additional meetings and a further formal presentation, attended by representatives of both D &amp; P and Goodwin Procter LLP. At this presentation, a summary was made of the due diligence and analysis to date, which included the following summary of its recommendation:</p>\n<blockquote>Unresolved asbestos litigation and potential asbestos legislation will affect the determination of whether Grace stock remains a prudent investment. The uncertainty and consequence of unfavorable events occurring as a result of litigation probabilities or of legislation not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> being enacted timely or at all, has resulted in the IFG<sup>[8]</sup> recommendation that the Committee override Plan documentation and begin to reduce the holdings of Grace stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The recommendation to commence a selling program is based upon the IFG's determination that the continued holding by the Trust of all of its shares of Grace stock would be <i>imprudent and therefore inconsistent with the requirements of Section 404(a)(1)(B) of ERISA.</i> Such determination reflects the input of [D &amp; P] and Goodwin [Procter LLP] and has been made after careful consideration of all of the facts and circumstances determined to be relevant by IFG.</blockquote>\n<p>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Thereafter, the Fiduciary Committee met again and unanimously approved this recommendation, establishing as a minimum sales price the midpoint valuation range found by D &amp; P of $1.88 per share. The divestment decision was communicated to the Plan's participants, who were also informed that the situation would continue to be monitored in case a change in strategy became necessary by reason of changed circumstances.</p>\n<p>Between February 25 and April 6, 2004, State Street sold approximately 900,000 shares of Grace stock in the open market transactions at then-prevailing New York Stock Exchange trading prices, ranging from $2.86 to $3.00 per share. During this period, State Street continued to monitor the Grace stock and received regular updates from D &amp; P regarding its equity valuation conclusion for Grace.</p>\n<p>On April 2, 2004, Shaw, an independent investor, made State Street an unsolicited offer to purchase the remaining 6.2 million shares of Grace stock still in the Plan's portfolio. The offer was for the entire lot at $3.50 per share, which was 8% higher than the closing price of $3.24 per share on April 1, and almost twice the mid-point equity valuation of $1.36 per share assessed by D &amp; P as of March 31, 2004. In the meantime, developments in the proposed legislative settlements required further investigation by D &amp; P and additional meetings with State Street, but ultimately it was concluded that there was no further need for D &amp; P to re-evaluate the equity valuation for Grace. This hiatus led to Shaw lowering its offer to $3.25 per share, after which Goodwin Procter LLP advised the Fiduciary Committee on recent events regarding Grace's exposure to asbestos liabilities. The Fiduciary Committee reaffirmed the basis for its conclusion that Grace stock was an inappropriate investment for the Plan because of the factors already considered, including the bankruptcy status of the company, the uncertainty that equity holders would receive value for the stock, and the outstanding asbestos litigation. The fundamentals regarding the Grace stock remaining unaltered from when the question was previously considered, the Fiduciary Committee voted unanimously to sell the remaining shares to Shaw provided that the original offer price of $3.50 was reinstated and that the sale did not burden the Plan with any commission expenses. The sale to Shaw was effectuated in two transactions, on April 12 and 19, 2004, at $3.50 per share, approximately 18% higher than the market closing price on those dates.</p>\n<p>There can be little doubt on this record that the state of Grace's corporate health was thoroughly studied by experts who debated and considered <i>ad nauseam</i> the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> pros and cons of retaining or selling the stock held in the Plan's portfolio. The unanimous conclusion of those charged with making the decision was that divestment of this stock was the only action consistent with the prudence required of a responsible fiduciary under ERISA. Without question, State Street engaged in a substantively sound, reasonable analysis of all relevant circumstances appropriate to the decision to sell the Grace stock. We cannot say that the district court's approval of these actions was in error.</p>\n<p>Appellants seek to induce us to reject State Street's actions by having us apply a presumption of prudence which is afforded fiduciaries when they decide to retain an employer's stock in falling markets, first articulated in <i>Kuper v. Iovenko,</i> 66 F.3d 1447, 1459 (6th Cir.1995) and <i>Moench,</i> 62 F.3d at 571-72. The presumption favoring retention in a \"stock drop\" case serves as a shield for a prudent fiduciary. If applied verbatim in a case such as our own, the purpose of the presumption is controverted and the standard transforms into a sword to be used against the prudent fiduciary. This presumption has not been so applied, and we decline to do so here, as it would effectively lead us to judge a fiduciary's actions in hindsight. Although hindsight is 20/20, as we have already stated, that is not the lens by which we view a fiduciary's actions under ERISA. <i>DiFelice,</i> 497 F.3d at 424; <i>Roth,</i> 16 F.3d at 917-18. Rather, given the situation which faced it, based on the facts <i>then known,</i> State Street made an assessment after appropriate and thorough investigation of Grace's condition. <i>Katsaros v. Cody,</i> 744 F.2d 270, 279 (2d Cir.1984).<sup>[9]</sup> This assessment led it to find that there was a real possibility that this stock could very well become of little value or even worthless to the Plan. It is this prudent assessment, and not a presumption of retention, applicable in another context entirely, which controls the disposition of this case. <i>See also </i><i>LaLonde v. Textron, Inc.,</i> 369 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir.2004) (expressing hesitance to apply a \"hard-and-fast rule\" in an ERISA fiduciary duty cases, and instead noting the importance of record development of the facts).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The decision of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>Costs are imposed on appellants.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  <i>Evans v.

Grace Retirement and Savings Plan (\"Plan\").<sup>[2]</sup> These actions allege breach of the fiduciary duty owed appellants pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"). 29 U.S.C. §§ 1109, 1132. Appellants sued their employer and retirement fund manager, W.R. Grace &amp; Co. (\"Grace\"), as well as their delegated fiduciary, State Street Bank (\"State Street\").<sup>[3]</sup> The latter was engaged by Grace to advise it regarding the soundness of retaining certain stock assets of the Plan and to act independently on said advice. In synthesis, appellants claim that Grace and State Street breached their fiduciary duty to appellants when State Street sold the Plan's holdings in Grace stock at an imprudently low price while Grace was in bankruptcy reorganization. They claim that Grace failed to properly monitor State Street in the performance of its delegated fiduciary duties. Because we conclude that the granting of summary judgment in favor of appellees was appropriate as a matter of law, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Facts</i><sup>[4]</sup></h2>\n<p>Since at least 1976, Grace has sponsored the Plan, a defined contribution 401(k) plan which offers participants an opportunity to invest wages in anticipation of retirement benefits. The Plan was administered by the Investments and Benefits Committee (\"IBC\") composed of Grace officers. The IBC was responsible for selecting and changing investment options offered under the Plan. Each Plan member, however, had the power to determine in which fund to invest at any given time. The Plan offered participants twenty eight different options, including the Grace Stock Fund, which invested in Grace stock. The Grace Stock Fund owned approximately 12% of Grace's outstanding shares.</p>\n<p>Commencing in the 1970s, Grace, which was a global manufacturer and supplier of catalysts and silica products, became a defendant in industry-wide asbestos-related personal injury suits. Because of potential massive liability, on April 2, 2001, Grace filed voluntary petitions for reorganization <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the District of Delaware.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>In the meantime, from September 1999 until the bankruptcy proceedings were initiated in April 2001, the market price of Grace stock fell from approximately $19 per share to $1.50 per share. During this period, Grace continued to maintain the Grace Stock Fund and to offer Grace stock as an investment option in the Plan.<sup>[6]</sup> Thereafter, while the bankruptcy proceedings continued their course, and during the certified class period, the stock price more or less stabilized at between $2.00 to $5.00 per share.</p>\n<p>On March 17, 2003, Brian McGowen, a member of the IBC, wrote the Plan's participants informing them that the Grace fiduciaries were \"seriously consider[ing]\" naming an independent fiduciary to operate the Grace Stock Fund in order to avoid any potential conflict of interest arising out of the reorganization plan in Grace's bankruptcy. Thereafter, Grace proceeded to amend the Plan to allow the IBC to appoint an independent investment manager for the Grace Fund. The amendment provided that:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he Independent Investment Manager shall have the following authority and duties:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(i) the continuous authority and duty to determine the extent that the continued retention of shares of Grace Stock within the Grace Stock Fund is not inconsistent with the applicable provisions of [ERISA], and to take actions in this regard that it deems appropriate; including the authority to dispose of Grace Stock held within the Grace Stock Fund and to close the Grace Stock Fund to participant trading.</blockquote>\n<p>Pursuant to this provision, in December 2003, after due deliberation, the IBC decided to resolve the potential conflict of interest conundrum by appointing State Street as an independent investment manager, granting it the powers and discretion authorized by the amended Plan. In this respect the independent investment manager was charged with determining the risks inherent in continued ownership of the Grace stock, including the extent of the contingent asbestos litigation liability, an analysis that was itself partially dependent on assessing the likelihood of enactment by Congress of the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2003. S. 1125, 108th Cong. (2003) (designed to provide economic relief to the litigation-ridden asbestos industry).</p>\n<p>Upon its appointment, State Street itself proceeded to seek expert advice by retaining Duff and Phelps LLC (\"D &amp; P\") for the purpose of obtaining an opinion regarding Grace's financial prospects, and the firm of Goodwin Procter LLP to provide appropriate legal counsel. After due consideration, D &amp; P prepared a report that concluded that the value of Grace stock was between $0.73 and $3.02 per share, with a midpoint value of $1.88 per share. Considering that the approximate market price of Grace stock was $3.51 per share at that time, the State Street Fiduciary Committee (\"Fiduciary Committee\"), charged with exercising the discretion assigned to State Street by Grace, entertained D &amp; P's findings and recommendations that the Grace stock be sold at its January 2004 meeting. The Fiduciary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> Committee, however, requested further findings.</p>\n<p>Upon reconvening in February, the Fiduciary Committee concluded that the Grace stock was an inappropriate investment because of the risks inherent to the price of the stock by reason of the potential liability extant in the continuing asbestos litigation. Concomitantly, it also found that \"the market price of W.R. Grace stock [was] not a good indication of its long term value.\" Thus, it decided that the best course to follow was to sell the Grace holdings on the open market.</p>\n<p>Before doing so, however, State Street gave advance notice to Grace of its decision to begin selling the Plan's Grace stock. It then notified the Plan's participants of its decision, but advised them that, notwithstanding this decision, it would \"continue to monitor the situation\" and might decide to end the sales effort if the circumstances required it. The Grace fiduciaries did not question State Street about why it decided to sell the Plan's Grace stock, in part because Robert Tarola (\"Tarola\") considered such inquiry \"off limits\" in view of the conflict of interest potential that led to delegation of the independent power to act to State Street.</p>\n<p>Relying in part on D &amp; P's valuation of the stock, State Street proceeded to sell 13% of its Grace stock holdings at between $2.86 and $3.09 per share.</p>\n<p>Approximately a month or two later, an independent third party investor, D.E. Shaw &amp; Co.(\"Shaw\"), sought to buy the Plan's remaining Grace stock. Shaw offered to buy this block at $3.50 per share, although the stock was then selling at $2.96 per share. State Street informed Grace of the offer and asked Tarola if there was anything that State Street should know about Grace before making a decision on this offer. Tarola responded that everything that State Street should know about Grace was available in the public domain.</p>\n<p>On April 12, 2004, State Street sold substantially all of the Plan's holdings in Grace stock to Shaw at $3.50 per share, and notified the Plan participants of its action. The balance of the Grace stock was passed to Shaw one week later, on April 17, 2004.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Although packaged in a more legalistic wrapping, the essence of appellants' allegations of fiduciary misconduct by Grace can be reduced to faulting Grace for its failure or refusal to insert itself into State Street's decision-making process. This may be an accurate statement of Grace's actions, or rather inactions; however, under the circumstances of this case, this did not constitute a breach of Grace or State Street's fiduciary duties to appellants under ERISA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Decision of the District Court</h2>\n<p>Before the district court, appellants argued that because Grace's stock traded in an efficient market,<sup>[7]</sup> absent evidence of eminent collapse of the stock price, State Street ought to have relied more heavily on market prediction of the stock's value, and \"Grace's solid potential in the future,\" before deciding to sell the Grace stock portfolio. <i>Bunch,</i> 532 F.Supp.2d at 287. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> Rather than selling this stock, appellants contended that the efficient market theory established that the <i>only</i> action consistent with ERISA was the retention of the Grace stock. <i>Id.</i> Because the Grace stock was traded in an efficient market, placing a different price than the market price into the valuation process, as was done by State Street, constituted \"second guessing\" the market and thus, according to appellants, imprudent fiduciary conduct. Appellees did not dispute that Grace stock traded in an efficient market but in contravention to appellants' position, Grace argued that the current market price of Grace stock constituted only one of the factors that a prudent fiduciary under ERISA needed to consider in deciding whether to retain or divest the stock from its portfolio.</p>\n<p>The district court agreed that \"the market was the best indicator of the stock's <i>present</i> value.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original). Nevertheless, it rejected appellants' notion that the efficient market was the standard by which the court should measure State Street's actions. The court concluded that the applicable standard was ERISA's prudent person standard. It ruled that ERISA did not require that a fiduciary maximize the value of investments, as Appellants seemed to imply by their arguments. Rather, what ERISA calls for from a fiduciary is that it use the \"care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(B). As the district court aptly stated, \"in common parlance, [what] ERISA fiduciaries owe participants [are] duties of prudence and loyalty,\" <i>Bunch,</i> 532 F.Supp.2d at 288 (citing <i>Moench v. Robertson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701747\"><a href=\"/opinion/701747/charles-moench-in-his-own-right-and-on-behalf-of-those-similarly-situated/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span>, 561 (3d Cir.1995)). The district court noted that other courts faced with allegations similar to those of appellants in this case had looked at the totality of the circumstances involved in the particular transaction. <i>Id.</i> Among the key decisions relied upon by the district court for reaching this conclusion was <i>DiFelice v. U.S. Airways, Inc.,</i> in which that court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>[W]e examine the totality of the circumstances, including, but not limited to: the plan structure and aims, the disclosures made to participants regarding the general and specific risks associated with investment in company stock, and the nature and extent of challenges facing the company that would have an effect on stock price and viability.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1023320\"><a href=\"/opinion/1023320/difelice-v-us-airways-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span>, 418 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Thus, the district court concluded, the relevant inquiry was not whether the market price was the best predictor of share value, as claimed by appellants, but whether State Street took into account all relevant information in carrying out its fiduciary duties under ERISA. <i>Bunch,</i> 532 F.Supp.2d at 288. The district court then enumerated the various factors considered by State Street, in addition to the D &amp; P report, in making its divestment decision, namely: the market price of the stock, information about the Plan, the bankruptcy proceedings, the financial outlook of the company, and the potential liability by reason of the asbestos litigation. State Street's analysis of these factors convinced the district court that there was a potential for loss of value of the Grace stock which was comparable to knowledge of an impending collapse, a conclusion which negated the presumption that retention of company stock was prudent under ERISA. <i>Id.</i> at 289; <i>see also </i><i>Moench,</i> 62 F.3d at 572. In any event, as the district court noted, because the shares in question were sold at a higher price than the then-existing market price, the best that appellants <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> could claim was that they could have earned more money had State Street not sold the Grace shares until a later date. The district court ruled that the test was not whether the best possible action was taken by State Street, but whether it had considered all relevant factors at the time of the divestment decision. <i>Id.</i> at 290.</p>\n<p>Although appellants exert strenuous efforts to have us conclude otherwise, we can find little to disagree with in the decision of the district court. We are nevertheless duty bound to consider appellants' contentions before us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Case on Appeal</h2>\n<p>On appeal appellants present us with two general complaints regarding the decision of the district court: first, they allege \"misapplication\" of the law concerning the presumption that the retention of company stock in a retirement plan is consistent with ERISA, and second, they claim error in the district court's \"mistaken\" equation of State Street's process for deciding to sell the Grace stock, which the court said \"took into consideration the totality of circumstances surrounding [said] stock,\" with a substantively sound and reasoned analysis of all relevant circumstances. <i>Id.</i> We shall discuss these contentions in inverse order of presentation because resolution of the second claimed error easily disposes of the first alleged fault.</p>\n<p>Considering the thorough investigative and decisional process that preceded the divestment of the Grace stock by the fiduciaries in this case, it is difficult, indeed impossible, given the standard of review which we are bound to follow, to legally challenge their actions in this appeal. Notwithstanding the re-framing of the issues before us, as stated above, it is clear from a reading of appellants' briefs that they continue to base their contentions of breach of fiduciary duty by State Street on the mistaken application of the efficient market theory to the facts of this case, a contention that was rejected by the district court. Specifically, this contention is the erroneously framed argument that State Street breached its duty by not giving sufficient weight to the market price in determining the value of the Grace stock.</p>\n<p>Reiterating what was decided by the district court, this position is plainly wrong. As cogently stated by that court, the efficient market is not the standard by which State Street's actions are to be judged. Rather, under ERISA, a fiduciary is required to act with \"`the care, skill, prudence and diligence ... that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use.'\" <i>Beddall v. State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197817\"><a href=\"/opinion/197817/beddall-v-state-street-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.1998) (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(B)). \"[T]he test of prudence  the Prudent Man Rule  is one of <i>conduct,</i> and not a test of the result of performance of the investment.\" <i>Donovan v. Cunningham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"424759\"><a href=\"/opinion/424759/raymond-j-donovan-secretary-of-the-united-states-department-of-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">716</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1455</span></a></span>, 1467 (5th Cir.1983) (emphasis added) (quotation marks omitted). \"[W]hether a fiduciary's actions are prudent cannot be measured in hindsight. ...\" <i>DiFelice,</i> 497 F.3d at 424. The \"test [is] how the fiduciary acted viewed from the perspective of the time of the challenged decision rather than from the vantage point of hindsight.\" <i>Roth v. Sawyer-Cleator Lumber Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"663131\"><a href=\"/opinion/663131/gerald-g-roth-logan-m-ammon-v-sawyer-cleator-lumber-company-employee/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">915</span></a></span>, 917-18 (8th Cir.1994) (quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, prudence \"involves a balancing of competing interests under conditions of uncertainty.\" <i>Armstrong v. LaSalle Bank Nat'l Ass'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794186\"><a href=\"/opinion/794186/juan-armstrong-on-behalf-of-themselves-and-others-similarly-situated-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">728</span></a></span>, 733 (7th Cir.2006). Rather than emphasizing one factor, the market price, as proposed by appellants, State Street correctly considered \"the totality of the circumstances,\" including, of course, the market price of the Grace stock. <i>See DiFelice,</i> 497 F.3d at 418; <i>Keach v. U.S.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> <i>Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791502\"><a href=\"/opinion/791502/debra-k-keach-and-patricia-a-sage-v-us-trust-company-formerly-known/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span>, 636-37 (7th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p>Under the circumstances of this case, the actions of both Grace and State Street, with relation to the divestment of the Grace stock held by the Plan, unquestionably meet the prudent man standard embodied in ERISA.</p>\n<p>First of all, upon concluding that the decisions required of Grace management in connection with the reorganization proceedings augured a potential conflict of interest with Grace's fiduciary duties, Grace took the eminently correct decision of insulating itself from that possibility. It amended the Plan, after duly notifying the participants of its intended action and notifying them of the reasons for its action. It then delegated the relevant decisional power to an independent third party, State Street, to render its expert, unbiased assessment of the Grace stock, and to execute its autonomous determination based on its conclusion regarding whether the Fund's retention or sale of Grace stock was appropriate. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1) (requiring a fiduciary to act \"solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries\"). State Street itself sought further assessment from two non-partisan professional entities, D &amp; P and Goodwin Procter LLP, whose expertise in their respective fields of knowledge is not questioned by appellants.</p>\n<p>State Street, as well as these two firms, in addition to closely monitoring the price fluctuations of the Grace stock on the market, compiled and studied Grace's financial performance and outlook, in particular analyzing how developments in the Grace bankruptcy and the process of reorganization could impact the value of Grace's common stock. Of prime importance was whether Grace's contingent asbestos liabilities in the bankruptcy could approach or exceed the value of equity in the company, thus diluting or altogether wiping out the value of the Grace stock in the Plan's portfolio. Among the factors considered by the State Street team at the various meetings and conferences regarding the asbestos contingent liability were: (1) the asbestos-related bodily injury claims being filed and pending against Grace; (2) the outcome of class action litigation pending against Grace regarding a product called Zonolite attic insulation material; (3) the availability of insurance coverage to pay asbestos claims; and (4) the probability of passage of legislation pending in Congress, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2003, which, if enacted, could reduce or cap Grace's liability for asbestos bodily injury claims.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, based on its investigations and analysis of the facts that it found, D &amp; P prepared and presented to State Street a detailed 88-page financial and valuation analysis of Grace, which included a determination of what it considered \"a reasonable pricing range for the [Grace] stock given the factors we believe should impact the value to equity investors.\" Based on these factors, the recommendation was made to State Street to commence selling the Grace stock holdings. Nevertheless, the Fiduciary Committee requested further analysis from its advisors, which led to additional meetings and a further formal presentation, attended by representatives of both D &amp; P and Goodwin Procter LLP. At this presentation, a summary was made of the due diligence and analysis to date, which included the following summary of its recommendation:</p>\n<blockquote>Unresolved asbestos litigation and potential asbestos legislation will affect the determination of whether Grace stock remains a prudent investment. The uncertainty and consequence of unfavorable events occurring as a result of litigation probabilities or of legislation not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> being enacted timely or at all, has resulted in the IFG<sup>[8]</sup> recommendation that the Committee override Plan documentation and begin to reduce the holdings of Grace stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The recommendation to commence a selling program is based upon the IFG's determination that the continued holding by the Trust of all of its shares of Grace stock would be <i>imprudent and therefore inconsistent with the requirements of Section 404(a)(1)(B) of ERISA.</i> Such determination reflects the input of [D &amp; P] and Goodwin [Procter LLP] and has been made after careful consideration of all of the facts and circumstances determined to be relevant by IFG.</blockquote>\n<p>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Thereafter, the Fiduciary Committee met again and unanimously approved this recommendation, establishing as a minimum sales price the midpoint valuation range found by D &amp; P of $1.88 per share. The divestment decision was communicated to the Plan's participants, who were also informed that the situation would continue to be monitored in case a change in strategy became necessary by reason of changed circumstances.</p>\n<p>Between February 25 and April 6, 2004, State Street sold approximately 900,000 shares of Grace stock in the open market transactions at then-prevailing New York Stock Exchange trading prices, ranging from $2.86 to $3.00 per share. During this period, State Street continued to monitor the Grace stock and received regular updates from D &amp; P regarding its equity valuation conclusion for Grace.</p>\n<p>On April 2, 2004, Shaw, an independent investor, made State Street an unsolicited offer to purchase the remaining 6.2 million shares of Grace stock still in the Plan's portfolio. The offer was for the entire lot at $3.50 per share, which was 8% higher than the closing price of $3.24 per share on April 1, and almost twice the mid-point equity valuation of $1.36 per share assessed by D &amp; P as of March 31, 2004. In the meantime, developments in the proposed legislative settlements required further investigation by D &amp; P and additional meetings with State Street, but ultimately it was concluded that there was no further need for D &amp; P to re-evaluate the equity valuation for Grace. This hiatus led to Shaw lowering its offer to $3.25 per share, after which Goodwin Procter LLP advised the Fiduciary Committee on recent events regarding Grace's exposure to asbestos liabilities. The Fiduciary Committee reaffirmed the basis for its conclusion that Grace stock was an inappropriate investment for the Plan because of the factors already considered, including the bankruptcy status of the company, the uncertainty that equity holders would receive value for the stock, and the outstanding asbestos litigation. The fundamentals regarding the Grace stock remaining unaltered from when the question was previously considered, the Fiduciary Committee voted unanimously to sell the remaining shares to Shaw provided that the original offer price of $3.50 was reinstated and that the sale did not burden the Plan with any commission expenses. The sale to Shaw was effectuated in two transactions, on April 12 and 19, 2004, at $3.50 per share, approximately 18% higher than the market closing price on those dates.</p>\n<p>There can be little doubt on this record that the state of Grace's corporate health was thoroughly studied by experts who debated and considered <i>ad nauseam</i> the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> pros and cons of retaining or selling the stock held in the Plan's portfolio. The unanimous conclusion of those charged with making the decision was that divestment of this stock was the only action consistent with the prudence required of a responsible fiduciary under ERISA. Without question, State Street engaged in a substantively sound, reasonable analysis of all relevant circumstances appropriate to the decision to sell the Grace stock. We cannot say that the district court's approval of these actions was in error.</p>\n<p>Appellants seek to induce us to reject State Street's actions by having us apply a presumption of prudence which is afforded fiduciaries when they decide to retain an employer's stock in falling markets, first articulated in <i>Kuper v. Iovenko,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705176\"><a href=\"/opinion/705176/19-employee-benefits-cas-1969-pens-plan-guide-p-23913r-glenn-kuper-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1447</span></a></span>, 1459 (6th Cir.1995) and <i>Moench,</i> 62 F.3d at 571-72. The presumption favoring retention in a \"stock drop\" case serves as a shield for a prudent fiduciary. If applied verbatim in a case such as our own, the purpose of the presumption is controverted and the standard transforms into a sword to be used against the prudent fiduciary. This presumption has not been so applied, and we decline to do so here, as it would effectively lead us to judge a fiduciary's actions in hindsight. Although hindsight is 20/20, as we have already stated, that is not the lens by which we view a fiduciary's actions under ERISA. <i>DiFelice,</i> 497 F.3d at 424; <i>Roth,</i> 16 F.3d at 917-18. Rather, given the situation which faced it, based on the facts <i>then known,</i> State Street made an assessment after appropriate and thorough investigation of Grace's condition. <i>Katsaros v. Cody,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"441979\"><a href=\"/opinion/441979/ted-katsaros-john-kuebler-robert-trott-lawrence-kudla-and-charles-curd/\"><span class=\"volume\">744</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span>, 279 (2d Cir.1984).<sup>[9]</sup> This assessment led it to find that there was a real possibility that this stock could very well become of little value or even worthless to the Plan. It is this prudent assessment, and not a presumption of retention, applicable in another context entirely, which controls the disposition of this case. <i>See also </i><i>LaLonde v.
