In March 2000, Victor Torres-Viera\n\nwas incarcerated at the Bayamón Correctional Institution, in the\n\nBayamón region of Puerto Rico.    He suffered serious injury while\n\nthere from being hit by a tear gas cannister fired by a prison\n\nofficial during a disturbance.   One year later, after his release,\n\nTorres-Viera brought a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000) claim for damages\n\nagainst prison officials, alleging violation of his rights under\n\nthe Eighth Amendment.   The district court judge ruled in favor of\n\nthe prison officials on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a\n\nclaim.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).     Torres-Viera appeals.    We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\n           Our review of a district court's dismissal of a complaint\n\nfor failure to state a claim1 under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is de\n\nnovo. Chute v. Walker, 281 F.3d 314, 318 (1st Cir. 2002).        We\n\naccept as true all well-pleaded facts alleged by the plaintiff in\n\nhis complaint, drawing in his favor all reasonable inferences\n\nfitting his stated theory of liability.    Calderón-Ortiz v. Laboy-\n\n\n\n\n     1\n        Defendants originally filed a motion to dismiss, arguing\nthat   Torres-Viera  had   failed   to  exhaust   the   available\nadministrative remedies. They later filed a supplementary motion\narguing that Torres-Viera had failed to state a claim. The court\nheld that the requirement of exhaustion of remedies did not apply\nbecause Torres-Viera was no longer incarcerated at the time of\nfiling. Torres-Viera v. Laboy-Alvardo, CIVIL 01-1361CCC, at 2\n(D.P.R. Oct. 3, 2001) (order). This issue is not before us.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fAlvarado, 300 F.3d 60, 63 (1st Cir. 2002); Rogan v. Menino, 175\n\nF.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           The    facts    as   described    in    Torres-Viera's     complaint\n\nfollow.    On or about March 28, 2000, in the early afternoon,\n\nseveral dozen prison officials carried out a general search at the\n\nBayamón Correctional Institution. During that search, many inmates\n\nwere taken to a room, formerly used as a cafeteria, where they were\n\nlocked in while the search continued.          An altercation subsequently\n\nbroke out between inmates and officials.                In response, prison\n\nguards began firing tear gas indiscriminately at inmates, both\n\nthose who were participating in the altercation and those who were\n\nnot.   Guards opened the door to the former cafeteria where inmates\n\nwere being held.       One officer fired a tear gas cannister directly\n\ninto the room and into the back of Torres-Viera's head.                 Torres-\n\nViera was knocked to the ground, stunned, and began bleeding\n\nprofusely from his wound, which later required eight stitches.\n\nSince the incident, Torres-Viera has suffered from headaches and\n\ndiscomfort.\n\n                                     II.\n\n           The    Eighth    Amendment       prohibits   cruel   and     unusual\n\npunishment of prisoners.         Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832\n\n(1994). The Supreme Court has established a standard of deliberate\n\nindifference     for   assessing   whether     a   constitutional     claim   is\n\nasserted that prison officials have a sufficiently culpable state\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fof mind in tolerating threats to inmate health or safety. Id. at\n\n834.\n\n          The standard is very different, however, when courts\n\nevaluate the behavior of prison officials during riots or other\n\ndisturbances.     The   Supreme   Court   has   held   that   a   deliberate\n\nindifference standard does not apply in these situations. Whitley\n\nv. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 320 (1986).            Instead, the standard is\n\nwhether unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering were inflicted,\n\nwith that question ultimately turning on \"whether force was applied\n\nin a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or\n\nmaliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\"\n\nId. at 320-21 (quoting Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d 1028, 1033 (2d\n\nCir. 1972)).    Central to our inquiry is the directive that:\n\n          It is obduracy and wantonness, not inadvertence or error\n          in good faith, that characterize the conduct prohibited\n          by the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause . . . . The\n          infliction of pain in the course of a prison security\n          measure, therefore, does not amount to cruel and unusual\n          punishment simply because it may appear in retrospect\n          that the degree of force authorized or applied for\n          security purposes was unreasonable, and hence unnecessary\n          in the strict sense.\n\nId. at 319.\n\n          \"[A] court may dismiss a complaint only if it is clear\n\nthat no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could\n\nbe proved consistent with the allegations.\" Swierkiewicz v. Sorema\n\nN.A., 534 U.S. 506, 514 (2002) (quoting Hishon v. King & Spalding,\n\n467 U.S. 69, 73 (1984)).      But even working within this generous\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fframework,    Torres-Viera's   complaint    falls   short.       The   facts\n\nconsistent with the pleadings in the complaint are that there was\n\na general prison disturbance and officials responded with tear gas,\n\nincluding in the room where plaintiff was held, and that he was\n\ninjured by a tear gas cannister.          Nothing has been pled in the\n\ncomplaint which permits a reasonable inference to be drawn that the\n\ntear gas cannister was fired maliciously or sadistically for the\n\nvery purpose of causing harm.        While plaintiffs are not held to\n\nhigher pleading standards in § 1983 actions, Leatherman v. Tarrant\n\nCounty Narcotics Intelligence & Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163,\n\n167-69 (1993), they must plead enough for a necessary inference to\n\nbe reasonably drawn.\n\n             To be sure, excessive use of tear gas by prison officials\n\ncan amount to an Eighth Amendment violation.          See, e.g., Soto v.\n\nDickey, 744 F.2d 1260, 1270 (7th Cir. 1984).         See generally Spain\n\nv. Procunier, 600 F.2d 189, 195-96 (9th Cir. 1979)(listing cases\n\n\"condemn[ing] the use of tear gas in particular circumstances as\n\nviolative of the Eighth Amendment or of due process or both.\").\n\nHere, however, the allegations concerning the context in which the\n\ngas was used establish that prison officials were responding to a\n\nsecurity disturbance.      This means that plaintiff must meet a very\n\nhigh standard in order to show that prison officials are culpable.\n\nSee 1 M.B. Mushlin, Rights of Prisoners § 2.05 at 64 (2d ed. 2001).\n\nPrison   officials   are   given   \"wide-ranging    deference\"    in   their\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fmeasures to restore order during disturbances.    Whitley, 475 U.S.\n\nat 321-22. Absent some facts from which a reasonable inference can\n\nbe drawn to meet that standard, the complaint fails to state a\n\nclaim.\n\n            Torres-Viera originally brought claims of supervisory\n\nliability against prison officials as well, but failed to argue\n\nthem on appeal.      Regardless, his failure to state any Eighth\n\nAmendment claim whatsoever dooms his supervisory claim. Burrell v.\n\nHampshire County, 307 F.3d 1, 2002 WL 31218304 at *7-*8 (Oct. 4,\n\n2002, 1st Cir.).\n\n            For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f",

The district court judge ruled in favor of the prison officials on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Torres-Viera appeals.

On or about March 28, 2000, in the early afternoon, several dozen prison officials carried out a general search at the Bayam&#243;n Correctional Institution. During that search, many inmates were taken to a room, formerly used as a cafeteria, where they were locked in while the search continued. An altercation subsequently broke out between inmates and officials. In response, prison guards began firing tear gas indiscriminately at inmates, both those who were participating in the altercation and those who were not. Guards opened the door to the former cafeteria where inmates were being held. One officer fired a tear gas cannister directly into the room and into the back of Torres-Viera's head. Torres-Viera was knocked to the ground, stunned, and began bleeding profusely from his wound, which later required eight stitches. Since the incident, Torres-Viera has suffered from headaches and discomfort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment of prisoners. <i>Farmer v.

The facts consistent with the pleadings in the complaint are that there was a general prison disturbance and officials responded with tear gas, including in the room where plaintiff was held, and that he was injured by a tear gas cannister. Nothing has been pled in the complaint which permits a reasonable inference to be drawn that the tear gas cannister was fired maliciously or sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.
