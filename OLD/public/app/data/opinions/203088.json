We recently denied a petition for review\n\nbrought by Mary Jane Lumanauw, see Lumanauw v. Mukasey, No. 07-1307\n\n(1st Cir. Dec. 7, 2007), a citizen of Indonesia who is the sister\n\nof Baby Irene Lumanauw, the petitioner in this case.    Both women\n\napplied for asylum, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1158, and withholding of\n\nremoval, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3).   Mary Jane's case was\n\nconsolidated with Baby Irene's case before the immigration judge\n\n(\"IJ\"), who issued an oral decision rejecting both sisters' claims.\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the IJ's decision as to\n\nboth women.\n\n          To qualify for asylum, an applicant must demonstrate that\n\nshe has suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.   8\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(1)(A), 1101(a)(42)(A).1     Although Mary Jane's\n\nasylum claim was time-barred, Baby Irene arrived in the United\n\nStates somewhat later and her claim is not time-barred.
