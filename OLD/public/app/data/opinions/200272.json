Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                        Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n                    Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Thomas Stylianos, Jr. on Anders brief and Motion to Withdraw\nas Counsel.\n     Paul Mounts on brief pro se.\n\n\n\n                              January 7, 2003\n\f          Per Curiam. Paul W. Mounts pled guilty to conspiring\n\nto distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine and\n\ncocaine   base,      in    violation    of    21    U.S.C.   §§   841(a)(1),\n\n841(b)(1)(A), and 846.        The district court determined that the\n\napplicable guideline imprisonment range under the sentencing\n\nguidelines    was    360    months     to   life.     However,    the   court\n\nconcluded that because a drug quantity had not been charged in\n\nthe indictment or proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt,\n\nunder Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), the maximum\n\nsentence Mounts could receive was 20 years.                  Therefore, the\n\ncourt sentenced him to 240 months in prison and 5 years of\n\nsupervised release.         He filed a notice of appeal.          Appointed\n\ncounsel has filed a brief under Anders v. California, 386 U.S.\n\n738 (1967), and Mounts has filed a pro se supplemental brief.\n\n          I.        Challenge to Guilty Plea\n\n          Two of the issues raised by Mounts are, in substance,\n\nchallenges to his guilty plea. First, he argues that he wanted\n\nto go to trial but that his attorney and the government\n\nattorney would not allow it.                 Second, he claims that the\n\ngovernment breached its promise that if he pled guilty and\n\ntestified at co-defendant Heidi Chaffee's trial, he would\n\nreceive a lenient sentence. These arguments are unsupported by\n\nthe record.\n\n                                     -2-\n\f           As to the first of these arguments, Mounts never\n\nasked the district court to allow him to withdraw his guilty\n\nplea.   Nor has he, even in the present filing, asserted his\n\ninnocence of the offense to which he pled guilty.           The plea\n\nhearing was conducted in conformity with the requirements of\n\nFed.R.Crim.P. 11. During the plea colloquy, Mounts denied that\n\nanyone had \"threatened [him] or . . . attempted to force [him]\n\nor induce [him] in any way to tender his plea of guilty.\"\n\n           As to Mounts' second argument, at his plea colloquy,\n\nhe assured the judge that no one had made a promise to him as\n\nto what sentence would be imposed.         \"Such statements in open\n\ncourt during a plea hearing 'carry a strong presumption of\n\nverity.'\" United States v. Martinez-Molina, 64 F.3d 719, 733\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).   Mounts' plea was entered pursuant to a written\n\nplea agreement which specifically stated that it did not\n\nrequire the government to move for a downward departure under\n\nU.S.S.G.   §   5K1.1.    Mounts   agreed   to   cooperate   with   the\n\ngovernment and the government agreed to recommend that Mounts\n\nbe sentenced on the basis of a drug quantity of 500 grams to\n\n1.5 kilograms of cocaine base. Mounts acknowledged in the plea\n\nagreement that \"there are no other promises or agreements,\n\neither express or implied, other than those contained in this\n\nAgreement.\"    We reject Mounts' challenge to his guilty plea.\n\n                                  -3-\n\f               To the extent that Mounts is claiming ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel, the factual record concerning Mounts'\n\nallegations that his attorney misled him about the consequences\n\nof pleading guilty or his right to proceed to trial is not\n\nsufficiently developed to permit reliable review on direct\n\nappeal.     See Lopez-Pineda, 55 F.3d at 697.            Our rejection of\n\nMounts' ineffective assistance claim is without prejudice to\n\nhis presenting that claim on collateral review under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2255.\n\n               II.   Challenge to Sentence\n\n               A. Evidence from Chaffee Trial\n\n               Mounts argues in his pro se brief that the sentencing\n\ncourt erred by increasing his sentence on account of evidence\n\nfrom the Chaffee trial that he had abused Chaffee, who was his\n\nfiancé    as    well   as   his   co-defendant.    \"Fed.R.Crim.P.      32,\n\nU.S.S.G. § 6A1.3 and the Due Process Clause of the United\n\nStates Constitution require that a defendant be apprised of the\n\ninformation to be relied on in sentencing and an opportunity to\n\nrebut such information.\" United States v. Berzon, 941 F.2d 8,\n\n1     7 (1st Cir. 1991).    This requirement was satisfied here.        At\n\nthe    presentence     conference,    the   sentencing    judge   informed\n\nMounts that he would be relying upon information received at\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthe Chaffee trial, \"thus enabling [Mounts] to respond to it\n\nbefore the sentence was set.\" Id. at 21.\n\n           Under the terms of the plea agreement, the court was\n\nprecluded from using Mounts' own testimony at the Chaffee trial\n\nin \"determining the applicable guideline range,\" with certain\n\nexceptions. See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.8.       To the extent that Mounts\n\nalleges that the court violated that prohibition, the record\n\ndoes not support such an allegation.         In any event, it is\n\nclear that no prejudice resulted from the court's reliance upon\n\nany evidence presented at the Chaffee trial.         The transcript\n\nfrom the sentencing hearing reveals that the court relied upon\n\nevidence from the Chaffee trial in deciding not to grant the\n\nthree-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.           Had\n\nMounts   received   the   three-level   reduction,   the   applicable\n\nguideline sentencing range would have been 262 to 327 months.\n\nThe sentence Mounts received (240 months) was well below that\n\nrange.\n\n           B. Drug Quantity\n\n           Mounts appears to argue in his brief that the drug\n\nquantity employed by the district court in arriving at his\n\nsentence was higher than the quantity calculated in the PSR.\n\nThe record belies that claim.\n\n           C. Government's Failure to Seek a § 5K1.1 Departure\n\n                                -5-\n\f           The government stated at the sentencing hearing that\n\nit had decided not to seek a § 5K1.1 departure because Mounts\n\nhad violated the law by attempting to smuggle cigarettes into\n\nthe prison where he was detained while awaiting sentencing.\n\nThe plea agreement specifically provided that the government\n\nwas not required to seek a § 5K1.1 departure. The government's\n\ndecision   not       to   seek   a   departure   was    not    based    on    any\n\nconstitutionally          impermissible     factors    and    was   rationally\n\nrelated    to    a    legitimate      government      end.      Under    these\n\ncircumstances,        the   government's     \"unbridled       discretion\"      in\n\ndeciding whether to file a § 5K1.1 motion was not constrained.\n\nSee United States v. Sandoval, 204 F.3d 283, 285 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n           D. Supervised Release Term\n\n           The sentencing court gave the parties advance notice\n\n(at the presentence conference) of its intent to impose a five-\n\nyear supervised release term and there was no objection.                     That\n\nterm did not exceed the governing statutory limits. See United\n\nStates v. Cortes-Claudio, No. 01-2113, slip op. at 8 (1st Cir.,\n\nDec. 2, 2002).            The court included in its Memorandum of\n\nSentencing Judgment the following reasons justifying a five-\n\nyear supervised release term: protection of the public and\n\nrehabilitation of the defendant. In the plea agreement, Mounts\n\n                                      -6-\n\fadmitted to a drug quantity of 50 grams or more of cocaine\n\nbase.    The United States Sentencing Guidelines' supervised\n\nrelease maximum corresponding with that drug quantity is five\n\nyears. See U.S.S.G. §5D1.2(a)(1).     Under these circumstances,\n\nthere is no non-frivolous argument that it was plain error for\n\nthe court to impose a five-year supervised release term. See\n\nUnited States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 62 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           Counsel's   motion   to    withdraw   is   granted   and\n\nappellant's conviction and sentence are affirmed. See Loc.R.\n\n27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f",
