D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                   Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Paul M. Glickman, by appointment of the court, with whom\nGlickman Turley LLP was on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          June 13, 2007\n\f          BOUDIN, Chief Judge. In the early morning hours of March\n\n7, 2005, Jennifer Godin entered the Super 8 Motel in Sanford,\n\nMaine, put a gun on the counter of the front desk, and told the\n\nclerk, \"Give me everything in the drawer.    Do what I say and you\n\nwon't get hurt.\"   The clerk then handed Godin paper currency and\n\nrolled coins, and Godin headed to the exit, saying, \"If you tell\n\nanybody, then I'm going to come back.\"      In the course of this\n\nthreat, Godin apparently pointed the gun at the clerk.1\n\n          The clerk called the police and later identified Godin as\n\nthe robber.   Sanford police arrested Godin at her home on March 9,\n\n2005.    They seized various items linking Godin to the crime,\n\nincluding a revolver that matched the description of the gun used\n\nin the robbery and papers from rolled coins.      The two handguns\n\nfound in Godin's house were later identified as having been stolen.\n\nWitnesses also indicated that Godin had admitted to having robbed\n\nthe motel on March 7.\n\n          Godin was charged with obstructing commerce by robbery,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1951(a) (2000), and with using and carrying a firearm--\n\nincluding brandishing the weapon--during and in relation to the\n\nrobbery, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii).   Godin pled guilty and was\n\nthereafter sentenced under the Sentencing Guidelines (the 2005\n\n\n\n     1\n      The government described the brandishing in its version of\nthe facts tendered during the later Rule 11 hearing.     Godin's\nattorney conceded that the government could offer proof of the\nallegations made in its version of events.\n\n                                -2-\n\fedition was used) to 262 months in prison.          She now appeals from\n\nher sentence.    Our review is de novo as to purely legal issues and\n\nmore deferential as to fact-finding and other issues.           See United\n\nStates v. Cao, 471 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           Godin's sentence comprised two elements:        178 months for\n\nthe robbery, followed by a mandatory term of 84 months for the\n\nbrandishing     of    a   gun,   required   by   statute   to   be   served\n\nconsecutively, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), (D)(ii). The combined\n\nguideline sentence for the two offenses was greatly lengthened\n\nbecause the district court determined that Godin was a \"career\n\noffender,\" defined as one whose current offense is \"a crime of\n\nviolence or a controlled substance offense\" and who has two prior\n\noffenses falling in either category.        U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(a).\n\n           A career offender's sentence calculation is based on a\n\nhigher offense level and a criminal history category at the highest\n\nlevel.   U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(b).      Because Godin was so designated, her\n\noffense level for the robbery, adjusted (as it was) for acceptance\n\nof responsibility, would typically have been raised to 29 (rather\n\nthan 17, as it would have been without this designation) and her\n\ncriminal history category to VI (rather than IV).           The resulting\n\nguideline sentence would have been 151 to 188 months for the\n\nrobbery alone.       U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A.\n\n           However, because Godin was a career offender and was\n\nconvicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), guideline section\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f4B1.1(c)(3)--which provides especially severe sentences in such\n\ncases--applied; the result was a combined sentence range of 262 to\n\n327 months.        Refusing to depart downward, the district court\n\nimposed the minimum--262 months--combined sentence, allocating 178\n\nmonths to the robbery and the minimum 84 months to the firearm\n\ncharge.2\n\n              On this appeal, Godin says the question whether she\n\nqualified as a career offender should have been determined by a\n\njury.       The Supreme Court has so far declined to extend the sixth\n\namendment prohibition on judicial fact-finding that increases the\n\npenalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum to situations\n\nwhere the question is whether the defendant has previously been\n\nconvicted of a crime.3       Godin says that under Shepard v. United\n\nStates, 544 U.S. 13 (2005), a jury is now required at least to\n\ndetermine whether her prior burglaries were related or not.\n\n              The Supreme Court's basic concern has been with fact-\n\nfindings that increase the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory\n\nmaximum sentence.       Because in this case the sentence imposed is\n\nwithin the existing statutory maximum for each of the two crimes,\n\n\n        2\n      The 84 months for violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) was\nthe statutory minimum; for the robbery, 178 months was well within\nthe statutory maximum of 240 months, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a).\n        3\n      See Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 487-90 (2000);\nAlmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 247 (1998). This\ncourt is committed to following Almendarez-Torres until it is\noverruled.   United States v. Ivery, 427 F.3d 69, 75 (1st Cir.\n2005), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1448 (2006).\n\n                                   -4-\n\fwhatever Shepard may entail has no effect here.                See United States\n\nv. Ngo, 406 F.3d 839, 843 n.1 (7th Cir. 2005); see also United\n\nStates v. Martins, 413 F.3d 139, 152 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 126\n\nS. Ct. 644 (2005).\n\n             The   question    remains      whether     the    district   judge's\n\nguideline calculations were correct. Godin had a number of brushes\n\nwith   the   law   before     the   motel    robbery,    but    only   two   prior\n\nconvictions qualified as crimes of violence or drug offenses. Each\n\nwas a burglary of a different apartment in the same apartment\n\nbuilding--one on July 26, 2002, and the other six days later on\n\nAugust 1, 2002.      In both cases, Godin knew the victim, had some\n\ngrievance, kicked in the apartment door and stole various items; in\n\none of the cases, she also trashed the apartment.\n\n             Burglary is classified under the pertinent guideline as\n\na crime of violence, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(a)(2), so the two 2002\n\nburglaries--together with the instant armed robbery of the motel--\n\nsupplied the necessary predicates for career offender status,\n\nunless the two prior burglaries are counted as only one conviction.\n\nThe career offender guidelines, by cross-reference, treat the two\n\nconvictions as only one (if not separated by an intervening arrest)\n\nwhere the offenses\n\n             (A) occurred on the same occasion, (B) were\n             part of a single common scheme or plan, or (C)\n             were consolidated for trial or sentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fU.S.S.G. § 4A1.2, cmt. 3.4\n\n          Subsection (A) did not apply to Godin's two burglaries.\n\nThis leaves subsections (B) and (C) for consideration.   Subsection\n\n(A)'s rationale is apparent--crimes committed on the same date are\n\narguably less reflective of \"career\" behavior than those separated\n\nby an opportunity to reflect, see United States v. Elwell, 984 F.2d\n\n1289, 1295 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 945 (1993)--but the\n\nreasons for (B) and (C) have puzzled courts and led to some\n\ndivergence in interpretation.    Why, one might ask, should two\n\nseparate crimes count for less because they were consolidated for\n\ntrial or sentencing or, worse still, part of a common scheme or\n\nplan?\n\n          Probably the best explanation is that sometimes such\n\ncrimes may seem like one course of criminal conduct and that\n\nconsolidation and the scheme or plan category were regarded as\n\ncrude proxies for this characteristic, the (frequent) misfit being\n\nacknowledged by an explicit warning in the commentary that their\n\napplication could result in undue leniency, correctable by an\n\nupward departure.   See U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2, cmt. 3.        This \"Rube\n\n\n\n     4\n      The section defining terms used in the career offender\nguideline, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(c), makes it a condition of having \"two\nprior felony convictions\" for violent or drug offense crimes that\neach resulted in a sentence \"counted separately\" under U.S.S.G. §\n4A1.1(a), (b) or (c); prior sentences \"in related cases\" count as\none for purposes of these subsections, U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a)(2); and\nthe limitation quoted in text is part of a comment defining\n\"related cases.\" U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2, cmt. 3.\n\n                                -6-\n\fGoldberg\" gimmickry, Elwell, 984 F.2d at 1295, has not encouraged\n\nan especially generous reading of subsections (B) and (C).\n\n           Our own cases insisting on an order of consolidation or\n\nsome   other   indicia    of    formal     consolidation   for    (C)    are\n\nrepresentative, see United States v. Bell, No. 06-1421, 2007 U.S.\n\nApp. LEXIS 10922, at *9-10 (1st Cir. May 9, 2007); Martins, 413\n\nF.3d at 152; United States v. Correa, 114 F.3d 314, 317 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 522 U.S. 927 (1997), and Godin conceded in the\n\ndistrict   court   that   her   prior    burglary   convictions   were   not\n\nformally consolidated.     Thus it does not matter that she pled and\n\nwas sentenced for both crimes at the same time, nor whether Maine\n\nhas a mechanism for formal consolidation.\n\n           In the absence of an order of consolidation, relatedness\n\nunder subsection (C) might nonetheless be established by sufficient\n\nindicia of formal consolidation.          See Bell, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS\n\n10922, at *10.     Here we have separate docket numbers and separate\n\nJudgment and Commitment orders.         The only indicia to the contrary\n\nare the probation documents--which are not enough on their own.\n\nAccord id. at *12.\n\n           The \"single common scheme or plan\" rubric of subsection\n\n(B) raises a more difficult issue.        The concept is vague and unlike\n\nsubsection (C) there is no formal test, such as a single indictment\n\nor a formal order of consolidation.             The circuit courts are\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fdivided5 as to whether the meaning of the phrase in subsection (B)\n\nis the same as the phrase \"common scheme or plan\" in section\n\n1B1.3(a)(2), which attributes to the defendant being sentenced\n\n\"relevant conduct\" including certain acts and omissions \"that were\n\npart of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the\n\noffense of conviction.\"\n\n               This matters only because the relevant conduct provision\n\nhas commentary that elaborates on the phrase, saying that a common\n\nscheme or plan must have at least one common factor connecting the\n\ntwo crimes, such as \"common victims, common accomplices, common\n\npurpose, or similar modus operandi.\"                U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3, cmt. 9(A).\n\nGodin       says   that   in   her   case    the   modus   operandi   of    the   two\n\nburglaries was similar; she also says that they involved the same\n\napartment building and that each was motivated by a desire for\n\nrevenge.\n\n               The district court, siding with the majority of the\n\ncircuits      that   have      spoken,   ruled     that   section   1B1.3   and   its\n\ncommentary does not control the meaning of section 4A1.2's \"single\n\ncommon scheme or plan\"; but the district court said that its\n\nconclusion--that the two burglaries were not part of a single\n\n\n        5\n      Compare United States v. Berry, 212 F.3d 391, 393-95 (8th\nCir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 907 (2000), United States v. Brown,\n209 F.3d 1020, 1024 n.9 (7th Cir. 2000), and United States v.\nBeckett, 208 F.3d 140, 147 n.2 (3d Cir. 2000), with United States\nv. LaBarbara, 129 F.3d 81, 86 (2d Cir. 1997), and United States v.\nMullens, 65 F.3d 1560, 1565 (11th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 517\nU.S. 1112 (1996).\n\n                                            -8-\n\fcommon scheme or plan--would be the same even if some weight were\n\ngiven    the    alleged   similarity    of   modus   operandi.     There   are\n\nlegitimate arguments for ignoring section 1B1.3, but either way the\n\nunderlying problem remains to give some sensible meaning to section\n\n4A1.2.\n\n               We said in Elwell that--for reasons there explained in\n\ndetail--the \"ordinary meaning\" of the phrase \"single common scheme\n\nor plan\" should be used.       984 F.2d at 1295.       Under that standard,\n\nit seems to us that to fall within section 4A1.2(a)(2), burglaries\n\nof two different apartments committed by one actor several days\n\napart need something more than resemblance of mode or motive even\n\nif that were relevant.       No one would say that a judge who tried two\n\nsimilar drug cases back to back did so pursuant to a common scheme\n\nor plan.\n\n               A scheme or plan implies some kind of connective tissue\n\nlike an initial plan encompassing multiple acts or a sequence of\n\nsteps to a single end.      See United States v. Joy, 192 F.3d 761, 771\n\n(7th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1250 (2000).             Nothing like\n\nthat was present in this case.         Perversely, as in Elwell, a party\n\nto a conspiracy to rob banks may come out ahead under section\n\n4A1.2(a)(2); but this is for the Sentencing Commission to fix, and\n\nwe will not cure the discrepancy by extending the protection of\n\nsubsection (B) to someone like Godin who is neither within its\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\flanguage, and whose circumstances do not implicate any obvious\n\npolicy pointing toward a lower sentence.\n\n          Godin says that even if within the guideline range, the\n\nsentence was unreasonably severe.      Under United States v. Booker,\n\n543 U.S. 220,   245-46, 259-60 (2005), the district judge can adopt\n\na non-guideline sentence where this is consistent with the broad\n\nsentencing factors listed in the statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)\n\n(2000); and, where the factors are properly understood, our review\n\nof the overall judgment by the district judge is deferential.\n\nUnited States v. Jiminez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(en banc), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 928 (2007).\n\n          Godin's claim for a lower sentence is not frivolous. She\n\nis now 30 years of age and, under the sentence imposed, will serve\n\n262 months in jail for a robbery that netted a few hundred dollars.\n\nHer sentences for the prior burglaries were 90 days and, although\n\nboth are by statute crimes of violence because of their potential\n\nfor violence, no physical harm to other individuals occurred.\n\nIndeed, it appears that no one else was present in either of the\n\nearlier episodes of burglary.\n\n          Two other considerations favoring leniency are stressed\n\nin Godin's brief.       The first is that Godin had a miserable\n\nchildhood and, in the district judge's words, a \"horrendous life.\"\n\nGodin was chronically abused as a child and sexually assaulted both\n\nas a child and adult.    Two of her brothers committed suicide, one\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fof   which    she     witnessed   at     a   young   age.     She   is    divorced,\n\nvoluntarily surrendered parental rights to two of her children, and\n\nhad her other two children removed from her care.                        One of her\n\nchildren was apparently sexually abused while not in Godin's\n\ncustody.\n\n              The other fact is that Godin suffers from mental illness,\n\nincluding depression, suicidal tendencies and schizo-affective\n\ndisorder      (a    catch-all     that       can   embrace   symptoms      both    of\n\nschizophrenia and of manic-depressive psychosis).                   She has been\n\nhospitalized for mental illness on several occasions.                    Her plight\n\nis complicated by a history of trauma and abuse, by an apparent\n\ninability to plan effectively for her future, and by considerable\n\ndrug use, primarily but not exclusively marijuana.\n\n              Yet, where there is a \"plausible explanation and a\n\ndefensible overall result,\" we normally respect the judgment of the\n\nlower court as to whether to go outside the guidelines.                    Jiminez-\n\nBeltre, 440 F.3d at 519.           Here, the district court acknowledged\n\nthat Godin's life had been awful and that she had eventually\n\ncooperated with the authorities in disclosing the circumstances\n\nthat led to multiple weapons being found in the apartment (but not\n\nquickly      enough    to   provide      substantial     assistance      under    the\n\nguidelines).\n\n              Recognizing     that     Godin       had   suffered   from     mental\n\nimpairments, the district judge nevertheless said that there was no\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fevidence that she was suffering from diminished capacity at the\n\ntime of the burglary and thus no basis for a downward departure\n\nunder the guidelines on this account, see U.S.S.G. § 5K2.13, and\n\nthat Godin's mental and emotional condition--a discouraged basis\n\nfor departure--was not so exceptional as to otherwise warrant a\n\ndeparture, see U.S.S.G. §§ 5H1.3, 5K2.0(a)(4).    Such a refusal to\n\ndepart is not ordinarily reviewable save for a mistake of law.\n\nUnited States v. Melendez-Torres, 420 F.3d 45, 50-51 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n          As to the reasonableness of the sentence, the district\n\njudge noted that while Godin's life had been blighted, the crime of\n\nconviction was extremely serious--robbery in which a weapon had\n\nbeen brandished at a victim--and that Godin's past history showed\n\na \"proclivity for drug abuse, for crime, for violence.\"   Further,\n\nthe judge recognized that Congress had determined that double\n\nrecidivism involving drugs or violence should be met by very stiff\n\nsentences, 28 U.S.C. § 994(h); U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, background cmt.,\n\nand he properly respected that decision.      See generally United\n\nStates v. Pho, 433 F.3d 53, 62 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          On review, Godin says that the \"proclivity\" finding is\n\noverstated both as to violence and drugs but this is very much a\n\njudgment call and the district court's statement is not clearly\n\nerroneous.   Godin had shown some potential for violence--evidenced\n\nboth by the possession and brandishing of the gun and by other\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fincidents in her past--and, while her use of marijuana is less\n\ndangerous than hard drugs, it was still regular drug use and\n\napparently one of the motives for her robbery.      Nor did the judge,\n\nas now claimed, \"ignore[]\" Godin's mental and emotional history.\n\n          Perhaps the strongest argument for Godin is that about\n\nthe worst she appears to have done in her prior burglaries was to\n\ntrash an apartment; thus, as to these two offenses, she is within\n\nthe letter of the career offender law but at the margin in terms of\n\ndangerousness.

Glickman, by appointment of the court, with whom Glickman Turley LLP, was on brief for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before BOUDIN, Chief Judge, CYR, Senior Circuit Judge, and HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOUDIN, Chief Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early morning hours of March 7, 2005, Jennifer Godin entered the Super 8 Motel in Sanford, Maine, put a gun on the counter of the front desk, and told the clerk, \"Give me everything in the drawer. Do what I say and you won't get hurt.\" The clerk then handed Godin paper currency and rolled coins, and Godin headed to the exit, saying, \"If you tell anybody, then I'm going to come back.\" In the course of this threat, Godin apparently pointed the gun at the clerk.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The clerk called the police and later identified Godin as the robber. Sanford police arrested Godin at her home on March 9, 2005. They seized various items linking Godin to the crime, including a revolver that matched the description of the gun used in the robbery and papers from rolled coins. The two handguns found in Godin's house were later identified as having been stolen. Witnesses also indicated that Godin had admitted to having robbed the motel on March 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Godin was charged with obstructing commerce by robbery, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a) (2000), and with using and carrying a firearm&#8212;including brandishing the weapon&#8212;during and in relation to the robbery, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). Godin pled guilty and was thereafter sentenced under the Sentencing Guidelines (the 2005 edition was used) to 262 months in prison. She now appeals from her sentence. Our review is <i>de novo</i> as to purely legal issues and more deferential as to fact-finding and other issues. <i>See United States v. Cao,</i> 471 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Godin's sentence comprised two elements: 178 months for the robbery, followed by a mandatory term of 84 months for the brandishing of a gun, required by statute to be served consecutively, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), (D)(ii). The combined guideline sentence for the two offenses was greatly lengthened because the district court determined that Godin was a \"career offender,\" defined as one whose current offense is \"a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense\" and who has two prior offenses falling in either category. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A career offender's sentence calculation is based on a higher offense level and a criminal history category at the highest level. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1(b). Because Godin was so designated, her offense level for the robbery, adjusted (as it was) for acceptance of responsibility, would typically have been raised to 29 (rather than 17, as it would have been without this designation) and her criminal history category to VI (rather than IV). The resulting guideline sentence would have been 151 to 188 months for the robbery alone. U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, because Godin was a career offender <i>and</i> was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), guideline section 4B1.1(c)(3)&#8212;which provides especially severe sentences in such cases&#8212;applied; the result was a combined sentence range of 262 to 327 months. Refusing to depart downward, the district court imposed the minimum&#8212;262 months&#8212;combined sentence, allocating 178 months to the robbery and the minimum 84 months to the firearm charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Godin says the question whether she qualified as a career offender should have been determined by a jury. The Supreme Court has so far declined to extend the sixth amendment prohibition on judicial fact-finding that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum to situations where the question is whether the defendant has previously been convicted of a crime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Godin says that under <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), a jury is now required at least to determine whether her prior burglaries were related or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court's basic concern has been with fact-findings that increase the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum sentence. Because in this case the sentence imposed is within the existing statutory maximum for each of the two crimes, whatever <i>Shepard</i> may entail has no effect here. <i>See United States v. Ngo,</i> 406 F.3d 839, 843 n. 1 (7th Cir.2005); <i>see also United States v. Martins,</i> 413 F.3d 139, 152 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 644, 163 L.Ed.2d 520 (2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question remains whether the district judge's guideline calculations were correct. Godin had a number of brushes with the law before the motel robbery, but only two prior convictions qualified as crimes of violence or drug offenses. Each was a burglary of a different apartment in the same apartment building&#8212;one on July 26, 2002, and the other six days later on August 1, 2002. In both cases, Godin knew the victim, had some grievance, kicked in the apartment door and stole various items; in one of the cases, she also trashed the apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burglary is classified under the pertinent guideline as a crime of violence, U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(a)(2), so the two 2002 burglaries&#8212;together with the instant armed robbery of the motel&#8212;supplied the necessary predicates for career offender status, unless the two prior burglaries are counted as only one conviction. The career offender guidelines, by cross-reference, treat the two convictions as only one (if not separated by an intervening arrest) where the offenses</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) occurred on the same occasion, (B) were part of a single common scheme or plan, or (C) were consolidated for trial or sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2, cmt. 3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsection (A) did not apply to Godin's two burglaries. This leaves subsections (B) and (C) for consideration. Subsection (A)'s rationale is apparent&#8212;crimes committed on the same date are arguably less reflective of \"career\" behavior than those separated by an opportunity to reflect, <i>see United States v. Elwell,</i> 984 F.2d 1289, 1295 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 508 U.S. 945, 113 S.Ct. 2429, 124 L.Ed.2d 650 (1993)&#8212; but the reasons for (B) and (C) have puzzled courts and led to some divergence in interpretation. Why, one might ask, should two separate crimes count for less because they were consolidated for trial or sentencing or, worse still, part of a common scheme or plan?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Probably the best explanation is that <i>sometimes</i> such crimes may seem like one course of criminal conduct and that consolidation and the scheme or plan category were regarded as crude proxies for this characteristic, the (frequent) misfit being acknowledged by an explicit warning in the commentary that their application could result in undue leniency, correctable by an upward departure. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2, cmt. 3. This \"Rube Goldberg\" gimmickry, <i>Elwell,</i> 984 F.2d at 1295, has not encouraged an especially generous reading of subsections (B) and (C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our own cases insisting on an order of consolidation or some other indicia of formal consolidation for (C) are representative, <i>see United States v. Bell,</i> 485 F.3d 54, 58-59 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Martins,</i> 413 F.3d at 152; <i>United States v. Correa,</i> 114 F.3d 314, 317 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 522 U.S. 927, 118 S.Ct. 326, 139 L.Ed.2d 253 (1997), and Godin conceded in the district court that her prior burglary convictions were not formally consolidated. Thus it does not matter that she pled and was sentenced for both crimes at the same time, nor whether Maine has a mechanism for formal consolidation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of an order of consolidation, relatedness under subsection (C) might nonetheless be established by sufficient indicia of formal consolidation. <i>See Bell,</i> 485 F.3d at 58-59. Here we have separate docket numbers and separate Judgment and Commitment orders. The only indicia to the contrary are the probation documents&#8212;which are not enough on their own. <i>Accord id.</i> at 59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"single common scheme or plan\" rubric of subsection (B) raises a more difficult issue. The concept is vague and unlike subsection (C) there is no formal test, such as a single indictment or a formal order of consolidation. The circuit courts are divided<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> as to whether the meaning of the phrase in subsection (B) is the same as the phrase \"common scheme or plan\" in section 1B1.3(a)(2), which attributes to the defendant being sentenced \"relevant conduct\" including certain acts and omissions \"that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This matters only because the relevant conduct provision has commentary that elaborates on the phrase, saying that a common scheme or plan must have at least one common factor connecting the two crimes, such as \"common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar <i>modus operandi.</i>\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, cmt. 9(A). Godin says that in her case the <i>modus operandi</i> of the two burglaries was similar; she also says that they involved the same apartment building and that each was motivated by a desire for revenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, siding with the majority of the circuits that have spoken, ruled that section 1B1.3 and its commentary does not control the meaning of section 4A1.2's \"single common scheme or plan\"; but the district court said that its conclusion&#8212;that the two burglaries were not part of a single common scheme or plan&#8212; would be the same even if some weight were given the alleged similarity of <i>modus operandi.</i> There are legitimate arguments for ignoring section 1B1.3, but either way the underlying problem remains to give some sensible meaning to section 4A1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We said in <i>Elwell</i> that&#8212;for reasons there explained in detail&#8212;the \"ordinary meaning\" of the phrase \"single common scheme or plan\" should be used. 984 F.2d at 1295. Under that standard, it seems to us that to fall within section 4A1.2(a)(2), burglaries of two different apartments committed by one actor several days apart need something more than resemblance of mode or motive even if that were relevant. No one would say that a judge who tried two similar drug cases back to back did so pursuant to a common scheme or plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A scheme or plan implies some kind of connective tissue like an initial plan encompassing multiple acts or a sequence of steps to a single end. <i>See United States v. Joy,</i> 192 F.3d 761, 771 (7th Cir.1999), <i>cert. denied,</i> 530 U.S. 1250, 120 S.Ct. 2704, 147 L.Ed.2d 974 (2000). Nothing like that was present in this case. Perversely, as in <i>Elwell,</i> a party to a conspiracy to rob banks may come out ahead under section 4A1.2(a)(2); but this is for the Sentencing Commission to fix, and we will not cure the discrepancy by extending the protection of subsection (B) to someone like Godin who is neither within its language, and whose circumstances do not implicate any obvious policy pointing toward a lower sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Godin says that even if within the guideline range, the sentence was unreasonably severe. Under <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 245-46, 259-60, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district judge can adopt a non-guideline sentence where this is consistent with the broad sentencing factors listed in the statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a) (2000); and, where the factors are properly understood, our review of the overall judgment by the district judge is deferential. <i>United States v. Jimenez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 928, 166 L.Ed.2d 715 (2007).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Godin's claim for a lower sentence is not frivolous. She is now 30 years of age and, under the sentence imposed, will serve 262 months in jail for a robbery that netted a few hundred dollars. Her sentences for the prior burglaries were 90 days and, although both are by statute crimes of violence because of their potential for violence, no physical harm to other individuals occurred. Indeed, it appears that no one else was present in either of the earlier episodes of burglary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two other considerations favoring leniency are stressed in Godin's brief. The first is that Godin had a miserable childhood and, in the district judge's words, a \"horrendous life.\" Godin was chronically abused as a child and sexually assaulted both as a child and adult. Two of her brothers committed suicide, one of which she witnessed at a young age. She is divorced, voluntarily surrendered parental rights to two of her children, and had her other two children removed from her care. One of her children was apparently sexually abused while not in Godin's custody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other fact is that Godin suffers from mental illness, including depression, suicidal tendencies and schizo-affective disorder (a catch-all that can embrace symptoms both of schizophrenia and of manic-depressive psychosis). She has been hospitalized for mental illness on several occasions. Her plight is complicated by a history of trauma and abuse, by an apparent inability to plan effectively for her future, and by considerable drug use, primarily but not exclusively marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet, where there is a \"plausible explanation and a defensible overall result,\" we normally respect the judgment of the lower court as to whether to go outside the guidelines. <i>Jimenez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519. Here, the district court acknowledged that Godin's life had been awful and that she had eventually cooperated with the authorities in disclosing the circumstances that led to multiple weapons being found in the apartment (but not quickly enough to provide substantial assistance under the guidelines).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that Godin had suffered from mental impairments, the district judge nevertheless said that there was no evidence that she was suffering from diminished capacity at the time of the burglary and thus no basis for a downward departure under the guidelines on this account, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.13, and that Godin's mental and emotional condition&#8212;a discouraged basis for departure&#8212;was not so exceptional as to otherwise warrant a departure, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 5H1.3, 5K2.0(a)(4). Such a refusal to depart is not ordinarily reviewable save for a mistake of law. <i>United States v. Melendez-Torres,</i> 420 F.3d 45, 50-51 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the reasonableness of the sentence, the district judge noted that while Godin's life had been blighted, the crime of conviction was extremely serious&#8212;robbery in which a weapon had been brandished at a victim&#8212;and that Godin's past history showed a \"proclivity for drug abuse, for crime, for violence.\" Further, the judge recognized that Congress had determined that double recidivism involving drugs or violence should be met by very stiff sentences, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(h); U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, background cmt., and he properly respected that decision. <i>See generally</i> <i>United States v. Pho,</i> 433 F.3d 53, 62 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On review, Godin says that the \"proclivity\" finding is overstated both as to violence and drugs but this is very much a judgment call and the district court's statement is not clearly erroneous. Godin had shown some potential for violence&#8212;evidenced both by the possession and brandishing of the gun and by other incidents in her past&#8212;and, while her use of marijuana is less dangerous than hard drugs, it was still regular drug use and apparently one of the motives for her robbery. Nor did the judge, as now claimed, \"ignore[]\" Godin's mental and emotional history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps the strongest argument for Godin is that about the worst she appears to have done in her prior burglaries was to trash an apartment; thus, as to these two offenses, she is within the letter of the career offender law but at the margin in terms of dangerousness. Yet, her conduct was escalating&#8212;the robbery involved a gun&#8212;and the district court had no reason to think that Godin could easily be deterred from repetitions. The statute is designed to give two chances and then to come down very hard the third time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A lower sentence could have been defended. But there was no mistake of law, the district judge made a thoughtful assessment, the result is not indefensible, and there the matter must stand. If Godin could rehabilitate herself in prison and dispel the very real threat of future harm, a responsible penal system would eventually consider a shortening of her sentence. The President, through the commutation process, may choose to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The government described the brandishing in its version of the facts tendered during the later Rule 11 hearing.

Do what I say and you won't get hurt.\" The clerk then handed Godin paper currency and rolled coins, and Godin headed to the exit, saying, \"If you tell anybody, then I'm going to come back.\" In the course of this threat, Godin apparently pointed the gun at the clerk.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The clerk called the police and later identified Godin as the robber. Sanford police arrested Godin at her home on March 9, 2005. They seized various items linking Godin to the crime, including a revolver that matched the description of the gun used in the robbery and papers from rolled coins. The two handguns found in Godin's house were later identified as having been stolen. Witnesses also indicated that Godin had admitted to having robbed the motel on March 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Godin was charged with obstructing commerce by robbery, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a) (2000), and with using and carrying a firearm&#8212;including brandishing the weapon&#8212;during and in relation to the robbery, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). Godin pled guilty and was thereafter sentenced under the Sentencing Guidelines (the 2005 edition was used) to 262 months in prison. She now appeals from her sentence. Our review is <i>de novo</i> as to purely legal issues and more deferential as to fact-finding and other issues. <i>See United States v. Cao,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202556\"><a href=\"/opinion/202556/united-states-v-cao/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Godin's sentence comprised two elements: 178 months for the robbery, followed by a mandatory term of 84 months for the brandishing of a gun, required by statute to be served consecutively, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), (D)(ii). The combined guideline sentence for the two offenses was greatly lengthened because the district court determined that Godin was a \"career offender,\" defined as one whose current offense is \"a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense\" and who has two prior offenses falling in either category. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A career offender's sentence calculation is based on a higher offense level and a criminal history category at the highest level. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1(b). Because Godin was so designated, her offense level for the robbery, adjusted (as it was) for acceptance of responsibility, would typically have been raised to 29 (rather than 17, as it would have been without this designation) and her criminal history category to VI (rather than IV). The resulting guideline sentence would have been 151 to 188 months for the robbery alone. U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, because Godin was a career offender <i>and</i> was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), guideline section 4B1.1(c)(3)&#8212;which provides especially severe sentences in such cases&#8212;applied; the result was a combined sentence range of 262 to 327 months. Refusing to depart downward, the district court imposed the minimum&#8212;262 months&#8212;combined sentence, allocating 178 months to the robbery and the minimum 84 months to the firearm charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Godin says the question whether she qualified as a career offender should have been determined by a jury. The Supreme Court has so far declined to extend the sixth amendment prohibition on judicial fact-finding that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum to situations where the question is whether the defendant has previously been convicted of a crime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Godin says that under <i>Shepard v.

Because in this case the sentence imposed is within the existing statutory maximum for each of the two crimes, whatever <i>Shepard</i> may entail has no effect here. <i>See United States v.

Godin had a number of brushes with the law before the motel robbery, but only two prior convictions qualified as crimes of violence or drug offenses. Each was a burglary of a different apartment in the same apartment building&#8212;one on July 26, 2002, and the other six days later on August 1, 2002. In both cases, Godin knew the victim, had some grievance, kicked in the apartment door and stole various items; in one of the cases, she also trashed the apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burglary is classified under the pertinent guideline as a crime of violence, U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(a)(2), so the two 2002 burglaries&#8212;together with the instant armed robbery of the motel&#8212;supplied the necessary predicates for career offender status, unless the two prior burglaries are counted as only one conviction. The career offender guidelines, by cross-reference, treat the two convictions as only one (if not separated by an intervening arrest) where the offenses</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) occurred on the same occasion, (B) were part of a single common scheme or plan, or (C) were consolidated for trial or sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2, cmt. 3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsection (A) did not apply to Godin's two burglaries. This leaves subsections (B) and (C) for consideration. Subsection (A)'s rationale is apparent&#8212;crimes committed on the same date are arguably less reflective of \"career\" behavior than those separated by an opportunity to reflect, <i>see United States v. Elwell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599256\"><a href=\"/opinion/599256/united-states-v-david-elwell-united-states-v-hobart-willis-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1289</span></a></span>, 1295 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">945</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Why, one might ask, should two separate crimes count for less because they were consolidated for trial or sentencing or, worse still, part of a common scheme or plan?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Probably the best explanation is that <i>sometimes</i> such crimes may seem like one course of criminal conduct and that consolidation and the scheme or plan category were regarded as crude proxies for this characteristic, the (frequent) misfit being acknowledged by an explicit warning in the commentary that their application could result in undue leniency, correctable by an upward departure. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2, cmt. 3. This \"Rube Goldberg\" gimmickry, <i>Elwell,</i> 984 F.2d at 1295, has not encouraged an especially generous reading of subsections (B) and (C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our own cases insisting on an order of consolidation or some other indicia of formal consolidation for (C) are representative, <i>see United States v.

Thus it does not matter that she pled and was sentenced for both crimes at the same time, nor whether Maine has a mechanism for formal consolidation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of an order of consolidation, relatedness under subsection (C) might nonetheless be established by sufficient indicia of formal consolidation. <i>See Bell,</i> 485 F.3d at 58-59. Here we have separate docket numbers and separate Judgment and Commitment orders. The only indicia to the contrary are the probation documents&#8212;which are not enough on their own. <i>Accord id.</i> at 59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"single common scheme or plan\" rubric of subsection (B) raises a more difficult issue. The concept is vague and unlike subsection (C) there is no formal test, such as a single indictment or a formal order of consolidation. The circuit courts are divided<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> as to whether the meaning of the phrase in subsection (B) is the same as the phrase \"common scheme or plan\" in section 1B1.3(a)(2), which attributes to the defendant being sentenced \"relevant conduct\" including certain acts and omissions \"that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This matters only because the relevant conduct provision has commentary that elaborates on the phrase, saying that a common scheme or plan must have at least one common factor connecting the two crimes, such as \"common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar <i>modus operandi.</i>\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, cmt. 9(A). Godin says that in her case the <i>modus operandi</i> of the two burglaries was similar; she also says that they involved the same apartment building and that each was motivated by a desire for revenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, siding with the majority of the circuits that have spoken, ruled that section 1B1.3 and its commentary does not control the meaning of section 4A1.2's \"single common scheme or plan\"; but the district court said that its conclusion&#8212;that the two burglaries were not part of a single common scheme or plan&#8212; would be the same even if some weight were given the alleged similarity of <i>modus operandi.</i> There are legitimate arguments for ignoring section 1B1.3, but either way the underlying problem remains to give some sensible meaning to section 4A1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We said in <i>Elwell</i> that&#8212;for reasons there explained in detail&#8212;the \"ordinary meaning\" of the phrase \"single common scheme or plan\" should be used. 984 F.2d at 1295. Under that standard, it seems to us that to fall within section 4A1.2(a)(2), burglaries of two different apartments committed by one actor several days apart need something more than resemblance of mode or motive even if that were relevant. No one would say that a judge who tried two similar drug cases back to back did so pursuant to a common scheme or plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A scheme or plan implies some kind of connective tissue like an initial plan encompassing multiple acts or a sequence of steps to a single end. <i>See United States v.

Perversely, as in <i>Elwell,</i> a party to a conspiracy to rob banks may come out ahead under section 4A1.2(a)(2); but this is for the Sentencing Commission to fix, and we will not cure the discrepancy by extending the protection of subsection (B) to someone like Godin who is neither within its language, and whose circumstances do not implicate any obvious policy pointing toward a lower sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Godin says that even if within the guideline range, the sentence was unreasonably severe.

She is now 30 years of age and, under the sentence imposed, will serve 262 months in jail for a robbery that netted a few hundred dollars. Her sentences for the prior burglaries were 90 days and, although both are by statute crimes of violence because of their potential for violence, no physical harm to other individuals occurred. Indeed, it appears that no one else was present in either of the earlier episodes of burglary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two other considerations favoring leniency are stressed in Godin's brief. The first is that Godin had a miserable childhood and, in the district judge's words, a \"horrendous life.\" Godin was chronically abused as a child and sexually assaulted both as a child and adult. Two of her brothers committed suicide, one of which she witnessed at a young age. She is divorced, voluntarily surrendered parental rights to two of her children, and had her other two children removed from her care. One of her children was apparently sexually abused while not in Godin's custody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other fact is that Godin suffers from mental illness, including depression, suicidal tendencies and schizo-affective disorder (a catch-all that can embrace symptoms both of schizophrenia and of manic-depressive psychosis). She has been hospitalized for mental illness on several occasions. Her plight is complicated by a history of trauma and abuse, by an apparent inability to plan effectively for her future, and by considerable drug use, primarily but not exclusively marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet, where there is a \"plausible explanation and a defensible overall result,\" we normally respect the judgment of the lower court as to whether to go outside the guidelines. <i>Jimenez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519. Here, the district court acknowledged that Godin's life had been awful and that she had eventually cooperated with the authorities in disclosing the circumstances that led to multiple weapons being found in the apartment (but not quickly enough to provide substantial assistance under the guidelines).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that Godin had suffered from mental impairments, the district judge nevertheless said that there was no evidence that she was suffering from diminished capacity at the time of the burglary and thus no basis for a downward departure under the guidelines on this account, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.13, and that Godin's mental and emotional condition&#8212;a discouraged basis for departure&#8212;was not so exceptional as to otherwise warrant a departure, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 5H1.3, 5K2.0(a)(4). Such a refusal to depart is not ordinarily reviewable save for a mistake of law. <i>United States v. Melendez-Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201783\"><a href=\"/opinion/201783/united-states-v-melendez-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 50-51 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the reasonableness of the sentence, the district judge noted that while Godin's life had been blighted, the crime of conviction was extremely serious&#8212;robbery in which a weapon had been brandished at a victim&#8212;and that Godin's past history showed a \"proclivity for drug abuse, for crime, for violence.\" Further, the judge recognized that Congress had determined that double recidivism involving drugs or violence should be met by very stiff sentences, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(h); U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, background cmt., and he properly respected that decision. <i>See generally</i> <i>United States v. Pho,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202000\"><a href=\"/opinion/202000/united-states-v-pho/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On review, Godin says that the \"proclivity\" finding is overstated both as to violence and drugs but this is very much a judgment call and the district court's statement is not clearly erroneous. Godin had shown some potential for violence&#8212;evidenced both by the possession and brandishing of the gun and by other incidents in her past&#8212;and, while her use of marijuana is less dangerous than hard drugs, it was still regular drug use and apparently one of the motives for her robbery. Nor did the judge, as now claimed, \"ignore[]\" Godin's mental and emotional history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps the strongest argument for Godin is that about the worst she appears to have done in her prior burglaries was to trash an apartment; thus, as to these two offenses, she is within the letter of the career offender law but at the margin in terms of dangerousness. Yet, her conduct was escalating&#8212;the robbery involved a gun&#8212;and the district court had no reason to think that Godin could easily be deterred from repetitions. The statute is designed to give two chances and then to come down very hard the third time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A lower sentence could have been defended. But there was no mistake of law, the district judge made a thoughtful assessment, the result is not indefensible, and there the matter must stand. If Godin could rehabilitate herself in prison and dispel the very real threat of future harm, a responsible penal system would eventually consider a shortening of her sentence.
