Defendant-appellant Harold\n\nEvans-García appeals from his conviction of aiding and abetting a\n\ncarjacking, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 2119(3), and a related firearms\n\noffense, id. §§ 2 and 924(c)(1).              He contends that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that he\n\nintended, or knew that his co-defendants intended, to inflict death\n\nor serious bodily harm as required by the carjacking statute.                 We\n\ndisagree, and accordingly affirm Evans-García's conviction and\n\nsentence.\n\nI.           Background\n\n             We   set   forth   the   trial   evidence   in   the   light   most\n\nfavorable to the prosecution.          United States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d\n\n27, 35 (1st Cir. 2001).         On March 23, 1996, Evans-García and five\n\nco-defendants -- Victor Lebrón-Cepeda, Francisco Trinidad-Kuilan,\n\nLuis R. Pagan-Melendez, Elvis Quiñones-Cruz, and Xavier Hernández-\n\nSan Miguel -- went to the El Valle Puerto Real Housing Project.\n\nEarlier in the evening, Trinidad had informed the group that he was\n\ncarrying a nickel-plated .38 caliber revolver.\n\n             At the housing project, Evans-García and co-defendants\n\nLebrón, Quiñones, and Trinidad went off to talk amongst themselves.\n\nWhile they were talking, Trinidad handed the revolver to Lebrón.\n\nEvans-García then informed Hernández that they were going to commit\n\na carjacking.      Hernández agreed to take them in his vehicle.1\n\n\n     1\n         Trinidad and Pagan decided not to accompany the others.\n\n                                       -2-\n\f              Somewhat      later,    Evans-García,       Lebrón,    Hernández     and\n\nQuiñones picked up co-defendant José R. Caraballo-González at the\n\nVeVe Calzado Housing Project.              Hernández drove the four others to\n\nthe Parque Pasivo Las Croabas, Fajardo, Puerto Rico. There, he and\n\nQuiñones dropped off Evans-García, Lebrón, and Caraballo and left\n\nthe park.         Parked nearby was a red 1994 Hyundai belonging to Ivan\n\nFontánez-Bruno.        In the car were Fontánez and Daisy Torres-Muñiz,\n\nboth Puerto Rico Police Department cadets.                 The Hyundai was built\n\nin Korea and shipped in interstate or foreign commerce.\n\n              While parked, Fontánez and Torres noticed that Evans-\n\nGarcía, Lebrón, and Caraballo were behaving suspiciously, and they\n\ndecided      to    leave.     Before      they    could   do   so,   the   three   men\n\nsurrounded the car, with Evans-García on the passenger side.\n\nCaraballo pointed a nickel-plated .38 revolver at Fontánez's head.2\n\nWhen       Fontánez    attempted     to    pull    his    police-issued     firearm,\n\nCaraballo told Fontánez \"not to pull anything\" because he had his\n\nfirearm already cocked.              Evans-García then ordered Fontánez and\n\nTorres out of the car and into the rear passenger seat; Fontánez\n\ndropped his firearm during this process.                  Evans-García sat in the\n\nfront passenger seat and picked up Fontánez's firearm.\n\n               Caraballo took the driver’s seat and gave the cocked\n\nrevolver to Lebrón, who sat in the rear passenger seat.                       Lebrón\n\n\n\n       2\n      It is unclear whether this was the same firearm that Trinidad\nhanded to Lebrón earlier in the evening.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fthen held the firearm to Fontánez's head.        As they drove out of the\n\npark, Evans-García accused Fontánez of being a police officer.\n\nWhen Fontánez and Torres begged for the defendants to release them\n\nand not to kill them, Caraballo and Lebrón informed them that it\n\nwas \"not their style\" and that Fontánez and Torres already knew\n\nwhere they     were   going,   to   which   Evans-García   added,   \"to   the\n\ncemetery.\"     Evans-García instructed Lebrón to take the victims'\n\nmoney and jewelry.\n\n           As they were driving, the car collided with something,\n\ncausing the front bumper to come loose and drag on the road.               At\n\nthat point, Evans-García again accused Fontánez of being a police\n\nofficer.   Immediately thereafter, Lebrón shot Fontánez once behind\n\nthe ear.     After a very short interval -- no more than a minute --\n\nEvans-García turned around and shot Fontánez approximately seven or\n\neight times in the chest and abdomen.\n\n             After the shooting, Caraballo stopped the car.          Evans-\n\nGarcía ordered that Fontánez’s body be pulled out of the car.              He\n\nthen pulled Torres out of the car on the passenger side and held\n\nher down by the hair.      Although Evans-García and Caraballo wanted\n\nto put her back in the car and kill her later, Lebrón persuaded\n\nthem not to. As the defendants drove off, Evans-García told Torres\n\nto run for her life.      The car dragged Fontánez’s body for a short\n\ndistance, until Evans-García freed it from the car door, leaving\n\nthe body and a highly distraught Torres at the side of the road.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f              On February 4, 1998, a federal grand jury returned a six-\n\ncount indictment against Evans-García and the four co-defendants.\n\nEvans-García was charged with aiding and abetting in an armed\n\ncarjacking resulting in death, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and\n\n2119(3), and aiding and abetting in the use and carrying of a\n\nfirearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 924(c)(1).             He pled not guilty.\n\n              Evans-García's jury trial was held in January, 2001.3 At\n\ntrial, he moved for acquittal, contending that the government had\n\nfailed to prove its case with regard to the carjacking count.                  The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion, and Evans-García was convicted on\n\nboth counts.       On October 5, 2001, the court sentenced Evans-García\n\nto two consecutive terms of life imprisonment pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(c)(3).\n\nII.           Discussion\n\n              On    appeal,    Evans-García       argues   that        there   was\n\ninsufficient evidence of his intent to aid and abet the carjacking\n\nto support his conviction and life sentences.              We review all the\n\nevidence, direct and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to\n\nthe prosecution, drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with\n\nthe   verdict      and   avoiding   credibility    judgments,     to    determine\n\nwhether a rational jury could have found him guilty beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.        Baltas, 236 F.3d at 35.\n\n\n      3\n          He was tried separately from his co-defendants.\n\n                                       -5-\n\f            As amended, the carjacking statute provides:\n\n            Whoever, with the intent to cause death or\n            serious bodily harm takes a motor vehicle that\n            has been transported, shipped, or received in\n            interstate or foreign commerce from the person\n            or presence of another by force and violence\n            or by intimidation, or attempts to do so,\n            shall --\n\n            (1) be fined under this title or imprisoned\n            not more than 15 years, or both,\n            (2) if serious bodily injury . . . results,\n            be fined under this title or imprisoned not\n            more than 25 years, or both, and\n\n            (3) if death results, be fined under this\n            title or imprisoned for any number of years up\n            to life, or both, or sentenced to death.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2119 (1994 ed. and Supp. III).\n\n            In Holloway v. United States, 526 U.S. 1 (1999), the\n\nSupreme Court clarified that the intent of the defendant is to be\n\nassessed when he \"took\" the vehicle:\n\n            The statute's mens rea component thus modifies\n            the act of \"tak[ing]\" the motor vehicle. It\n            directs the factfinder's attention to the\n            defendant's state of mind at the precise\n            moment he demanded or took control over the\n            car   \"by    force   and   violence    or   by\n            intimidation.\"\n\nId. at 8.   The Court further held that the intent to cause death or\n\nserious bodily harm could be satisfied not only by \"actual\" intent\n\nbut also by \"conditional\" intent, i.e., a willingness to cause\n\ndeath or serious bodily harm if necessary to hijack the car.    Id.\n\nat 11-12.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f            There   is   an   additional   layer   in   the   analysis   of\n\nEvans-García's intent in this case, as the indictment and judgment\n\nstate that he was an aider and abetter in the offenses.4            To be\n\nliable as an aider and abetter, a defendant must have \"consciously\n\nshared the principal's knowledge of the underlying criminal act,\n\nand intended to help the principal.\"          United States v. Otero-\n\nMendez, 273 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting United States v.\n\nTaylor, 54 F.3d 967, 975 (1st Cir. 1995)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).   The aider and abetter must have shared the principal's\n\ncriminal intent; \"[a] generalized suspicion is not enough.\" Id. at\n\n52 (citing United States v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586, 591 (1st Cir.\n\n1994)).5\n\n            During the course of this appeal, Evans-García's legal\n\narguments have mutated.       In his opening brief, he conceded that he\n\nwas guilty of the crime of carjacking. He contended, however, that\n\nhe lacked the specific intent to cause death, which he asserted was\n\n\n\n     4\n      In its brief, the government contends that Evans-García was\na principal in the carjacking, but that alternatively, his\nconviction should be affirmed based on aider and abetter liability.\n     5\n      We recently noted, in the context of a carjacking case, the\ndifficulty of \"articulat[ing] a precise intent standard\" for aiding\nand abetting.   Otero-Mendez, 273 F.3d at 52.     Although we have\npreviously required evidence that the defendant was \"on notice\" of\nthe principal's intent, we have not decided whether he must know to\na \"practical certainty.\" Id. (internal citations omitted.) We\nneed not reach this issue in this case, as we conclude infra that\na reasonable jury could have found that Evans-García knew to a\npractical certainty that his co-defendants intended to inflict\ndeath or serious bodily injury.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fnecessary to incur the enhanced penalty under 18 U.S.C. § 2119(3)\n\n(\"if death results\").      In his reply brief, Evans-García changed\n\ncourse, saying that he had initially misapprehended the statute,\n\nand argued that he lacked \"the intent to cause death or serious\n\nbodily harm\" at the time of the taking of the car and hence could\n\nnot be found guilty of any carjacking under the statute.     At oral\n\nargument, he continued to maintain that he was not liable for\n\ncarjacking, and renewed the argument from his opening brief that he\n\nlacked the requisite intent for the enhanced penalty.\n\n          Arguments raised for the first time in reply briefs are\n\ngenerally deemed waived.     United States v. Brennan, 994 F.2d 918,\n\n922 n.7 (1st Cir. 1993).    In any event, there is ample evidence to\n\nsupport the jury's conclusion that Evans-García possessed -- or\n\nknew that the principals possessed -- at least conditional intent\n\nto inflict death or bodily harm at the time he and his co-\n\ndefendants took the car.       First, the jury heard evidence that\n\nEvans-García was involved in the preparations for the carjacking.\n\nCo-defendant Pagan-Melendez testified that he observed Evans-García\n\nand two other co-defendants, Lebrón and Trinidad, engage in a\n\ndiscussion during which Trinidad handed a revolver to Lebrón.     At\n\nthe end of this discussion, Pagan-Melendez heard Evans-García say\n\nthat \"they were going to do a carjacking.\"\n\n          Second, Evans-García was an active participant in the\n\ncarjacking itself.      With his co-defendants, he surrounded the\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fvictims' car to prevent them from exiting.             He was present when\n\nCaraballo placed the revolver to Fontánez's head and told him it\n\nwas cocked.    He directed Torres to climb into the rear car seat and\n\npicked up Fontánez's firearm.         Significantly, there was evidence\n\nfrom which the jury could have found that Evans-García told the\n\nvictims that they were on their way \"to the cemetery.\"6\n\n           In sum, the use of the firearm and the co-defendants'\n\nstatements provided sufficient evidence of their conditional intent\n\nto   inflict   injury   or   death   if    necessary   to   take   control   of\n\nFontánez's car.    See Holloway, 526 U.S. at 11-12.         The trial record\n\nalso supported the conclusion that Evans-García knew to a practical\n\ncertainty that his co-defendants possessed this intent and indeed\n\nshared it, permitting the jury to find him liable as an aider and\n\nabetter.\n\n           Next, Evans-García maintains that subsection (3) does not\n\napply because he lacked specific intent to cause Fontánez’s death.\n\nSuch intent, he contends, is a requirement additional to that set\n\nforth in the body of § 2119, i.e., that the carjacker intended to\n\ncause death or serious bodily harm at the time he took the vehicle.\n\nThe government contends that no such additional specific intent to\n\nkill is required under 18 U.S.C. § 2119(3), and that subsection (3)\n\n\n      6\n      Evans-García contends that there were inconsistencies in\nTorres's trial testimony as to which defendant made this statement.\nA review of the record, however, indicates that there was ample\nevidence from which the jury could have credited Torres's testimony\nthat it was Evans-García who said it.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fconcerns only the causal issue of whether death resulted from the\n\ncarjacking.   We need not delve into this question, as the evidence\n\nat trial supports the conclusion that Evans-García intended to\n\ncause death when he shot Fontánez.\n\n           Evans-García shot Fontánez seven or eight times in the\n\nchest and abdomen at close range, shortly after accusing Fontánez\n\nof being a police officer.       Despite Evans-García's contention that\n\nhis victim was already dead when he shot him, evidence at trial\n\nshowed that either Lebrón's shot to the head or Evans-García's\n\nmultiple   shots   less   than    a   minute    later   could   have   caused\n\nFontánez’s death.     This evidence, in conjunction with that set\n\nforth supra, supports the conclusion that Evans-García intended to\n\nkill Fontánez.\n\n           Accordingly,     we     AFFIRM      Evans-García's    carjacking\n\nconviction and sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f",

The Court further held that the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm could be satisfied not only by \"actual\" intent but also by \"conditional\" intent, i.e., a willingness to cause death or serious bodily harm if necessary to hijack the car. <i>Id.</i> at 11-12, 119 S.Ct. 966.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an additional layer in the analysis of Evans-Garc&#237;a's intent in this case, as the indictment and judgment state that he was an aider and abetter in the offenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> To be liable as an aider and abetter, a defendant must have \"consciously shared the principal's knowledge of the underlying criminal act, and intended to help the principal.\" <i>United States v. Otero-Mendez,</i> 273 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 975 (1st Cir.1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The aider and abetter must have shared the principal's criminal intent; \"[a] generalized suspicion is not enough.\" <i>Id.</i> at 52 (citing <i>United States v. Loder,</i> 23 F.3d 586, 591 (1st Cir.1994)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of this appeal, Evans-Garc&#237;a's legal arguments have mutated. In his opening brief, he conceded that he was guilty of the crime of carjacking. He contended, however, that he lacked the specific intent to cause death, which he asserted was necessary to incur the enhanced penalty under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119(3) (\"if death results\"). In his reply brief, Evans-Garc&#237;a changed course, saying that he had initially misapprehended the statute, and argued that he lacked \"the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm\" at the time of the taking of the car and hence could not be found guilty of any carjacking under the statute. At oral argument, he continued to maintain that he was not liable for carjacking, and renewed the argument from his opening brief that he lacked the requisite intent for the enhanced penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arguments raised for the first time in reply briefs are generally deemed waived. <i>United States v. Brennan,</i> 994 F.2d 918, 922 n. 7 (1st Cir.1993). In any event, there is ample evidence to support the jury's conclusion that Evans-Garc&#237;a possessed &#8212; or knew that the principals possessed &#8212; at least conditional intent to inflict death or bodily harm at the time he and his co-defendants took the car. First, the jury heard evidence that Evans-Garc&#237;a was involved in the preparations for the carjacking. Co-defendant Pagan-Melendez testified that he observed Evans-Garc&#237;a and two other co-defendants, Lebr&#243;n and Trinidad, engage in a discussion during which Trinidad handed a revolver to Lebr&#243;n. At the end of this discussion, Pagan-Melendez heard Evans-Garc&#237;a say that \"they were going to do a carjacking.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Evans-Garc&#237;a was an active participant in the carjacking itself. With his co-defendants, he surrounded the victims' car to prevent them from exiting. He was present when Caraballo placed the revolver to Font&#225;nez's head and told him it was cocked. He directed Torres to climb into the rear car seat and picked up Font&#225;nez's firearm. Significantly, there was evidence from which the jury could have found that Evans-Garc&#237;a told the victims that they were on their way \"to the cemetery.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the use of the firearm and the co-defendants' statements provided sufficient evidence of their conditional intent to inflict injury or death if necessary to take control of Font&#225;nez's car. <i>See Holloway,</i> 526 U.S. at 11-12, 119 S.Ct. 966. The trial record also supported the conclusion that Evans-Garc&#237;a knew to a practical certainty that his co-defendants possessed this intent and indeed shared it, permitting the jury to find him liable as an aider and abetter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Evans-Garc&#237;a maintains that subsection (3) does not apply because he lacked specific intent to cause Font&#225;nez's death. Such intent, he contends, is a requirement additional to that set forth in the body of &#167; 2119, i.e., that the carjacker intended to cause death or serious bodily harm at the time he took the vehicle. The government contends that no such additional specific intent to kill is required under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119(3), and that subsection (3) concerns only the causal issue of whether death resulted from the carjacking. We need not delve into this question, as the evidence at trial supports the conclusion that Evans-Garc&#237;a intended to cause death when he shot Font&#225;nez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evans-Garc&#237;a shot Font&#225;nez seven or eight times in the chest and abdomen at close range, shortly after accusing Font&#225;nez of being a police officer. Despite Evans-Garc&#237;a's contention that his victim was already dead when he shot him, evidence at trial showed that either Lebr&#243;n's shot to the head or Evans-Garc&#237;a's multiple shots less than a minute later could have caused Font&#225;nez's death. This evidence, in conjunction with that set forth <i>supra,</i> supports the conclusion that Evans-Garc&#237;a intended to kill Font&#225;nez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we <i>AFFIRM</i> Evans-Garc&#237;a's carjacking conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Trinidad and Pagan decided not to accompany the others</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> It is unclear whether this was the same firearm that Trinidad handed to Lebr&#243;n earlier in the evening</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> He was tried separately from his co-defendants</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In its brief, the government contends that Evans-Garc&#237;a was a principal in the carjacking, but that alternatively, his conviction should be affirmed based on aider and abetter liability</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We recently noted, in the context of a carjacking case, the difficulty of \"articulat[ing] a precise intent standard\" for aiding and abetting<i>Otero-Mendez,</i> 273 F.3d at 52.

On March 23, 1996, Evans-Garc&#237;a and five co-defendants &#8212; Victor Lebr&#243;n-Cepeda, Francisco Trinidad Kuilan, Luis R. Pagan-Melendez, Elvis Qui&#241;ones Cruz, and Xavier Hern&#225;ndez-San Miguel &#8212; went to the El Valle Puerto Real Housing Project.

While they were talking, Trinidad handed the revolver to Lebr&#243;n. Evans-Garc&#237;a then informed Hern&#225;ndez that they were going to commit a carjacking. Hern&#225;ndez agreed to take them in his vehicle.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Somewhat later, Evans-Garc&#237;a, Lebr&#243;n, Hern&#225;ndez and Qui&#241;ones picked up co-defendant Jos&#233; R. Caraballo-Gonz&#225;lez at the VeVe Calzado Housing Project. Hern&#225;ndez drove the four others to the Parque Pasivo Las Croabas, Fajardo, Puerto Rico. There, he and Qui&#241;ones dropped off Evans-Garc&#237;a, Lebr&#243;n, and Caraballo and left the park. Parked nearby was a red 1994 Hyundai belonging to Ivan Font&#225;nez-Bruno. In the car were Font&#225;nez and Daisy Torres-Mu&#241;iz, both Puerto Rico Police Department cadets.

Before they could do so, the three men surrounded the car, with Evans-Garc&#237;a on the passenger side. Caraballo pointed a nickel-plated .38 revolver at Font&#225;nez's head.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> When Font&#225;nez attempted to pull his police-issued firearm, Caraballo told Font&#225;nez \"not to pull anything\" because he had his firearm already cocked.

When Font&#225;nez and Torres begged for the defendants to release them and not to kill them, Caraballo and Lebr&#243;n informed them that it was \"not their style\" and that Font&#225;nez and Torres already knew where they were going, to which Evans-Garc&#237;a added, \"to the cemetery.\" Evans-Garc&#237;a instructed Lebr&#243;n to take the victims' money and jewelry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As they were driving, the car collided with something, causing the front bumper to come loose and drag on the road.

In his opening brief, he conceded that he was guilty of the crime of carjacking. He contended, however, that he lacked the specific intent to cause death, which he asserted was necessary to incur the enhanced penalty under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119(3) (\"if death results\"). In his reply brief, Evans-Garc&#237;a changed course, saying that he had initially misapprehended the statute, and argued that he lacked \"the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm\" at the time of the taking of the car and hence could not be found guilty of any carjacking under the statute. At oral argument, he continued to maintain that he was not liable for carjacking, and renewed the argument from his opening brief that he lacked the requisite intent for the enhanced penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arguments raised for the first time in reply briefs are generally deemed waived. <i>United States v.

In any event, there is ample evidence to support the jury's conclusion that Evans-Garc&#237;a possessed &#8212; or knew that the principals possessed &#8212; at least conditional intent to inflict death or bodily harm at the time he and his co-defendants took the car. First, the jury heard evidence that Evans-Garc&#237;a was involved in the preparations for the carjacking. Co-defendant Pagan-Melendez testified that he observed Evans-Garc&#237;a and two other co-defendants, Lebr&#243;n and Trinidad, engage in a discussion during which Trinidad handed a revolver to Lebr&#243;n. At the end of this discussion, Pagan-Melendez heard Evans-Garc&#237;a say that \"they were going to do a carjacking.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Evans-Garc&#237;a was an active participant in the carjacking itself. With his co-defendants, he surrounded the victims' car to prevent them from exiting. He was present when Caraballo placed the revolver to Font&#225;nez's head and told him it was cocked. He directed Torres to climb into the rear car seat and picked up Font&#225;nez's firearm. Significantly, there was evidence from which the jury could have found that Evans-Garc&#237;a told the victims that they were on their way \"to the cemetery.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the use of the firearm and the co-defendants' statements provided sufficient evidence of their conditional intent to inflict injury or death if necessary to take control of Font&#225;nez's car. <i>See Holloway,</i> 526 U.S. at 11-12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118265\"><a href=\"/opinion/118265/holloway-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></a></span>. The trial record also supported the conclusion that Evans-Garc&#237;a knew to a practical certainty that his co-defendants possessed this intent and indeed shared it, permitting the jury to find him liable as an aider and abetter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Evans-Garc&#237;a maintains that subsection (3) does not apply because he lacked specific intent to cause Font&#225;nez's death. Such intent, he contends, is a requirement additional to that set forth in the body of &#167; 2119, i.e., that the carjacker intended to cause death or serious bodily harm at the time he took the vehicle. The government contends that no such additional specific intent to kill is required under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119(3), and that subsection (3) concerns only the causal issue of whether death resulted from the carjacking. We need not delve into this question, as the evidence at trial supports the conclusion that Evans-Garc&#237;a intended to cause death when he shot Font&#225;nez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evans-Garc&#237;a shot Font&#225;nez seven or eight times in the chest and abdomen at close range, shortly after accusing Font&#225;nez of being a police officer. Despite Evans-Garc&#237;a's contention that his victim was already dead when he shot him, evidence at trial showed that either Lebr&#243;n's shot to the head or Evans-Garc&#237;a's multiple shots less than a minute later could have caused Font&#225;nez's death. This evidence, in conjunction with that set forth <i>supra,</i> supports the conclusion that Evans-Garc&#237;a intended to kill Font&#225;nez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we <i>AFFIRM</i> Evans-Garc&#237;a's carjacking conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Trinidad and Pagan decided not to accompany the others</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> It is unclear whether this was the same firearm that Trinidad handed to Lebr&#243;n earlier in the evening</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> He was tried separately from his co-defendants</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In its brief, the government contends that Evans-Garc&#237;a was a principal in the carjacking, but that alternatively, his conviction should be affirmed based on aider and abetter liability</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We recently noted, in the context of a carjacking case, the difficulty of \"articulat[ing] a precise intent standard\" for aiding and abetting<i>Otero-Mendez,</i> 273 F.3d at 52.
