VÁZQUEZ-RIVERA,\n\n                       Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n           APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n         [Hon. Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                  Porfilio,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Edward J. DeAngelo, was on brief, for appellant.\n     Sonia I. Torres-Pabón, Assistant United States Attorney,\nChief, Criminal Division, with whom H.S. García, United States\nAttorney, and Germán A. Rieckehoff, Assistant United States\nAttorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           May 18, 2005\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.         Defendant-appellant Jorge A.\n\nVázquez Rivera (\"defendant\") appeals from his conviction on one\n\ncount of conspiracy to possess cocaine and heroin with intent to\n\ndistribute under 21 U.S.C. § 846.         For the reasons stated below, we\n\naffirm his conviction.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           We recount the relevant facts in the light most favorable\n\nto the jury verdict.    See United States v. Casas, 356 F.3d 104, 109\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           The government presented the testimony of seven witnesses\n\nin its case in chief, six of whom testified pursuant to plea\n\nagreements.   José Borrero Feliciano (\"Borrero\") testified that,\n\nafter he was released from prison in 1991, he approached defendant\n\nabout working for him in the drug business.           Borrero stated that,\n\nafter defendant consulted with Roberto Soto Andón (\"Soto\"), he\n\nbegan selling cocaine and heroin on behalf of defendant and Soto.\n\nAccording to Borrero, defendant told him that he was in charge of\n\nthe drug point at the La Ceiba Housing Project in Ponce, Puerto\n\nRico (\"the Ceiba drug point\").        Borrero stated that he never saw\n\ndefendant sell drugs on the street, but that he went to defendant's\n\nhome to replenish his drug supplies.\n\n           Alberto Negrón Constantino (\"Negrón\") testified that he\n\nmet   defendant   in   1995   and   sold    him   cocaine   and   heroin   for\n\ndistribution by Soto's drug operation.              Negrón initially sold\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fcocaine and heroin to defendant's brother Víctor Vázquez Rivera.\n\nIn   late   1996   or   early   1997,    Negrón   began   working   for   Soto.\n\nAccording to Negrón, Soto removed defendant as the head of the\n\nCeiba drug point.       Negrón then took over the Ceiba drug point and\n\nbegan purchasing the cocaine and heroin for the drug point himself.\n\nAnother co-conspirator, Daniel Sánchez Ortiz (\"Sánchez\"), testified\n\nthat he was a drug runner in the Soto organization and that he\n\nbought and sold drugs from defendant's brother.                While Sánchez\n\nnever dealt directly with defendant, he was instructed by Víctor\n\nVázquez Rivera that he was acting on behalf of defendant.\n\n            Another witness, Edwin Meléndez Negrón, stated that he\n\nhad been supplied drugs by defendant for his drug point elsewhere\n\nin the Ponce area.       In addition, he testified that he went to Las\n\nCucharas jail in Ponce, Puerto Rico with defendant to visit Soto\n\nwhile he was confined there.       Alexander Figueroa Delgado testified\n\nthat he lived for about a month with a cousin who sold heroin for\n\ndefendant. Finally, Yazmin Laracuente Alameda testified that after\n\nher husband was arrested on drug charges, she began selling cocaine\n\nfor defendant.\n\n            Defendant appealed from the jury verdict, alleging the\n\nfollowing: (1) improper testimony from a government witness; (2)\n\nthe prosecutor's closing arguments were rife with error; and (3)\n\ndefendant's sentence was improperly enhanced.                In supplemental\n\nbriefing, defendant also appealed his sentence on the basis that it\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fwas imposed in violation of United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738\n\n(2005).   We address each argument in turn.\n\n                                II.\n\nA.   Improper Testimony\n\n           Defendant argues on appeal that the case agent, Iván\n\nLugo, gave improper vouching testimony.       Because there was no\n\ncontemporaneous objection, we review for plain error.      To show\n\nplain error, a defendant must show that an error occurred, which\n\nwas clear and obvious; and that it affected defendant's substantial\n\nrights and seriously impaired the fairness, integrity or public\n\nreputation of the public proceedings.   See United States v. Pérez-\n\nRuiz, 353 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           Defendant argues that the testimony of Agent Lugo was\n\nimproper because, in the course of rebuttal, the prosecution twice\n\nelicited a statement from Lugo purporting to \"certify\" that Víctor\n\nVázquez Rivera, defendant's brother, would not have received a\n\nsafety valve credit if he had not incriminated the defendant.\n\nFurther, defendant argues, it was improper to allow testimony that\n\nAgent Lugo \"already knew\" that defendant was involved in drug\n\ntrafficking.\n\n           Improper vouching occurs when \"prosecutors . . . place\n\nthe prestige of the United States behind a witness by making\n\npersonal assurances of credibility or by suggesting that facts not\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fbefore the jury support the witness's account.\"           United States v.\n\nTorres-Galindo, 206 F.3d 136, 140 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            Agent Lugo initially testified in the government's case\n\nin chief.   The statements that defendant objects to on appeal were\n\ngiven after defendant's brother, Víctor Vázquez Rivera, testified\n\nfor the defense.   Víctor Vázquez Rivera testified that his brother\n\nwas not involved in Roberto Soto's operations and that he had never\n\ndistributed   cocaine   or   heroin.    In   order   to   impeach   Vázquez\n\nRivera's testimony, the government called Agent Lugo to the stand\n\nagain.   He testified to the following:\n\n                   Q [by AUSA]:   Sir, did you have an\n            opportunity  to  interview  Víctor  Vázquez\n            Rivera?\n\n                   Agent Lugo:    Yes, ma'am.\n\n                   Q:  And what was the purpose of that\n            interview?\n\n                   A:   It was a safety valve debriefing.\n\n                   Q:   Please explain to the members of\n            the jury, what is a safety valve debriefing?\n\n                   A:    Safety valve debriefing is an\n            opportunity for the defendant [referring to\n            Víctor Vázquez Rivera] to speak to the\n            government and give us his admissions of their\n            [sic] criminal activities. And this statement\n            cannot be used against him once [he] give[s]\n            it to us at that particular time, and in\n            return they receive the benefit of the safety\n            valve debriefing.\n\n                   Q: When you say give the opportunity,\n            [Víctor Vázquez Rivera] an opportunity to\n            speak about him, is he also required under the\n            law to speak about everything he knows?\n\n                                  -5-\n\f       A:   Yes, ma'am.\n\n. . . .\n\n       THE COURT:   Well, when you say about\neverything he knows, so that we are exact, the\nrequirement on the safety valve debriefing is\nthat he testifies about everything he knows\nabout the offense that he is pleading to, or\nother offenses that have a common scheme or\nplan with that offense . . . .\n\n. . . .\n\n       Q:   Do you recall what, if anything,\ndid Víctor Vázquez say about Jorge Vázquez,\nhis brother during that debriefing?\n\n       A: Yes, ma'am. The first thing that I\nremember in reference to that is when I\nstarted talking to him about his brother and\nRobert[o Soto-Andón], he refused to talk. He\nsaid that he wasn't going to say anything\nregarding his brother or Robert[o Soto-Andón].\nAnd at that point --\n\n. . . .\n\n       A: At that point he was advised, you\nknow, that if he didn't say everything that he\nknew, he couldn't receive credit.\n       He kept stubbornly saying that he\nwasn't going to say anything, that he didn't\ncare.\n       At that point I contacted the U.S.\nAttorney's Office and advised them of the\nproblem I was having. And you know, it was\nconveyed to Mr. Vázquez, Víctor Vázquez, that\nhe had to say everything that he knew related\nto the charges that he had been involved, with\nthe criminal activities he had been charged,\nand that part of that was talking about his\nbrother.\n       He stated that he was not going to\ntestify against his brother or anybody else\nand then reluctantly admitted his brother\nworked for Robert[o Soto-Andón], he was a\nrunner for [him].\n\n                      -6-\n\f         . . . .\n\n                Q: Sir, do you know if the government\n         certified later on [sic] the court that Víctor\n         Vázquez had complied with meeting with the\n         United States and providing all information he\n         had?\n\n                   A:   Yes, ma'am.\n\n         . . . .\n\n                Q: [After Agent Lugo was shown a copy\n         of his notes] Sir, is this the only reference\n         to Robert[o Soto-Andón] and [defendant] in any\n         of these notes?\n\n                A: Yes, ma'am. If you notice, it has\n         the asterisk next to it, that was when we\n         reached the point during the interview that I\n         began to have the problem that I mentioned\n         earlier with Mr. Víctor Vázquez. Once I asked\n         him about Robert[o Soto-Andón] and his\n         brother, that was when we had that problem and\n         I made those notations there, the asterisk.\n         Also, the part about [defendant] being a\n         \"compadre\" of --\n\n                   Q:   Why did you put that down?\n\n                A: Because I didn't know that. I knew\n         about Robert[o Soto-Andón] organization, about\n         the drug trafficking, but I had no knowledge\n         that [defendant] was the \"compadre\" of\n         Robert[o Soto-Andón].    So I felt that was\n         something I had to write down to remember it.\n\n                   Q:   Who gave you that information?\n\n                   A:   Víctor Vázquez, ma'am . . . .\n\n          After   defendant's   counsel   cross-examined   Agent   Lugo\n\nregarding his taking of notes during the safety valve debriefing,\n\nAgent Lugo gave the following testimony on redirect:\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f           Q:    Mr. Lugo, would the government have\n           certified that Víctor Vázquez had provided the\n           information   if  he   had   not  stated   the\n           information about his brother?\n\n           . . . .\n\n           A:     No, the government would not certify him.\n\n\n           Defendant argues that Agent Lugo attempted to vouch for\n\nthe credibility of Víctor Vázquez Rivera.            Defendant's argument\n\nfails   because    Agent   Lugo   was   not   attempting   to    bolster   the\n\ncredibility of any witness, he was merely explaining the procedure\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f).          Agent Lugo was not, as defendant\n\nsuggests, stating that Víctor Vázquez Rivera told the truth at the\n\nsafety valve hearing, although that is its purpose.             See generally\n\nUnited States v. Matos, 328 F.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir. 2003)(stating\n\nthat \"a safety valve debriefing is a situation that cries out for\n\nstraight talk; equivocations, half-truths, and veiled allusions\n\nwill not do\").     Instead, the statement was introduced to show that\n\nVíctor Vázquez Rivera gave a prior inconsistent statement to Agent\n\nLugo, which contradicted his testimony during the trial.                   The\n\nstatement was couched in terms of the certification, but that was\n\nnot meant to imply that the government was vouching for Víctor\n\nVázquez Rivera's credibility; in fact, it sought the opposite -- to\n\nimpeach by providing a statement which contradicted his trial\n\ntestimony.      Cf. Pérez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d at 12        (the prohibition on\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fvouching extends to propping up a dubious witness through the\n\ntestimony of a government agent).\n\n           Defendant also objects to the agent's testimony regarding\n\nhis knowledge of the drug operation as inadmissible hearsay, and\n\npoints to United States v. Casas, 356 F.3d 104 (1st Cir. 2004), as\n\nanalogous to this appeal.   In Casas, we held that the testimony of\n\na government agent that the defendants were members of a drug\n\nconspiracy was inadmissible hearsay.    Id. at 117-18.   Defendant's\n\nargument must be rejected, however, because here the statement was\n\nnot offered to prove that a conspiracy existed, but only to explain\n\nwhy the agent's notes had omitted certain information. See Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 801(c)(stating that hearsay is \"a statement, other than one\n\nmade by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,\n\noffered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted\").\n\nIn Casas, the testimony was given by the case agent to prove that\n\nthe conspiracy existed.      Id. at 118 (stating that the agent\n\ntestified as to the existence of the drug trafficking organization,\n\nthat all four defendants were members and that the organization\n\nhandled cocaine and heroin).   It was found to be reversible error\n\nto admit the testimonial statement in that case because it sought\n\nto establish the existence of the conspiracy, i.e., the ultimate\n\nissue in the case, before the jury had made that determination.\n\nHere, as the statement was not offered for its truth, it is not\n\nhearsay.\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f           Defendant also argues that the statement regarding the\n\nsafety valve hearing was improper hearsay testimony.                    Where, as\n\nhere, a statement is introduced to impeach a statement that a\n\nwitness provided on direct examination, the statement is admissible\n\nfor that purpose.       The government argues that the evidence is\n\nadmissible under Fed. R. Evid. 613(b), which provides for the\n\nadmissibility    of   extrinsic       evidence       of   a   prior   inconsistent\n\nstatement by a witness as long as the witness is afforded an\n\nopportunity to explain or deny his statement. See United States v.\n\nWinchenbach,    197   F.3d     548,   558     (1st    Cir.    1999)(holding   that\n\n\"comparison and contradiction are the hallmarks of Rule 613(b)\").\n\nIn this case, Víctor Vázquez Rivera testified and was cross-\n\nexamined and had ample opportunity to explain himself. Id. at 559.\n\nThere was no error in allowing the testimony.\n\nB.   Closing Argument\n\n           Defendant        argues    that    the    Assistant    United    States\n\nAttorney   engaged     in    prosecutorial       misconduct      during    closing\n\nargument and rebuttal.        Because there was no objection made in the\n\ndistrict court during the closing argument, we review only for\n\nplain error.    See Pérez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d at 9 (citing United States\n\nv. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001)).\n\n           1.   Vouching During Closing Argument\n\n           \"A prosecutor improperly vouches for a witness when she\n\nplaces the prestige of her office behind the government's case by,\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fsay, imparting her personal belief in a witness's veracity or\n\nimplying that the jury should credit the prosecution's evidence\n\nsimply because the government can be trusted.\"     Pérez-Ruiz, 353\n\nF.3d at 9 (citing United States v. Figueroa-Encarnación, 343 F.3d\n\n23, 28 (1st Cir. 2000)).\n\n           The defense alleges that the following statements made\n\nduring closing arguments constituted improper vouching:\n\n           [d]id [Víctor] implicate his brother? If not,\n           how did he get that advantage from ten to\n           five?   Because he complied with the safety\n           valve, and he was told this is a confidential\n           things [sic], this is for intelligence\n           purposes.\n\n           . . .\n\n                  Couldn't Agent Lugo come up with a\n           better story if we're going to talk about, you\n           know, I'm going to come and \"cuadrar esto\"1 to\n           say something that didn't happen.     Consider\n           what was not said, look at those notes.\n           Couldn't Agent Lugo put, \"Yes, he told me\n           this, this, and this, and this didn't happen.\"\n           Wouldn't that be a better story to present\n           before the jury?\n\n                  And that's one thing I also ask you,\n           when you consider are these people making up\n           stories, couldn't they have made up a better\n           story? They've been in jail for four years,\n           couldn't   everything  have   come  in   here\n           \"cuadrao,\" he lived here, he did this and\n           this. They had all the time in the world, but\n           that   was   not   the  case.      They   had\n           contradictions like human beings are [sic].\n\n\n\n\n1\n    \"Square this.\"\n\n                               -11-\n\f          According   to   defendant,   the   prosecution   improperly\n\nvouched for witnesses during closing argument because it used the\n\nfact that Víctor Vázquez Rivera got a safety valve reduction as\n\nevidence of his truthfulness. Defendant argues that the government\n\nput its prestige behind Víctor Vázquez Rivera's testimony.\n\n          Defendant argues that under United States v. Auch, 187\n\nF.3d 125, 131-32 (1st Cir. 1999), and United States v. Manning, 23\n\nF.3d 570, 572-73 (1st Cir. 1994), this type of vouching amounts to\n\nprosecutorial misconduct.2   In Pérez-Ruiz, we made clear that any\n\ndictum from Auch, which \"rest[ed] on an understandable misreading\n\nof [Manning],\" was disclaimed. Pérez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d at 10 (stating\n\nthat the statements made in Auch were not good law).        During the\n\ncourse of the trial, defendant questioned the veracity of every\n\nwitness in the government's case in chief, charging them with bias\n\nresulting from their negotiated plea and cooperating agreements.\n\n          The closing argument was \"a logical counter to the\n\nassertions of defense counsel, made in summation, that various\n\ngovernment witnesses had fabricated their testimony because they\n\n\n\n2\n   In Manning, this court condemned as vouching a portion of the\nprosecutor's statement containing the argument that a detective\nwould have created a more damaging story had he intended to\nfabricate evidence. Manning, 23 F.3d at 572. The portion found to\nconstitute vouching, though, consisted of statements at the\nconclusion of this line of argument to the effect that government\nwitnesses do not lie.    Id. at 572-73.    In dictum in Auch, the\nManning ruling was mischaracterized to suggest that the argument\nthat a witness would have fabricated a better story had he intended\nto lie amounts to vouching. Auch, 187 F.3d at 131-32.\n\n                                -12-\n\fwanted the [defendant] behind bars and would stop at nothing to put\n\nhim   there.        We   typically   cede    prosecutors   some    latitude   in\n\nresponding     to    defense   counsel's     allegations   of     fabrication.\"\n\nPérez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d at 9-10.           Given the defense's strategy, we\n\nbelieve that the prosecutor was directly addressing defendant's\n\nnumerous allegations of fabrication and not improperly vouching for\n\nwitnesses by placing the government's prestige behind them.\n\n             2.     Reference to murder conviction\n\n             Defendant argues that the prosecution made a gratuitous\n\nreference to Soto's murder conviction by saying that he was serving\n\ntime for murder when defendant visited him at Las Cucharas and that\n\nthe prosecutor argued guilt by association.                 \"A defendant is\n\nentitled to have the question of his guilt determined by the\n\nevidence against him, not on whether a co-defendant or government\n\nwitness has been convicted of the same charge.\"             United States v.\n\nDworken, 855 F.2d 12, 30 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n           On the first day of trial, the government and defendant\n\ninformed the judge that they had reached an agreement not to\n\nmention most or any murders that involved witnesses.                  Soto was\n\nconvicted of first degree murder and released on probation before\n\nthe conspiracy at issue here began. The government's theory of the\n\ncase involved the defendant's visits to Soto's house, in particular\n\nwhere he went with a government witness during Soto's probation.\n\nDefendant concedes that this association was relevant to the\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fconspiracy, but argues that there was no need to mention the\n\nconviction and the only reason that the prosecutor did so was so\n\nthe jury would be more likely to convict.\n\n          The   government    argues    that   evidence   of    the   murder\n\nconviction   was   already   entered   into    the   record    through   the\n\ntestimony of several witnesses.    See United States v. McKeeve, 131\n\nF.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 1997)(holding that a prosecutor may accurately\n\ndescribe the testimony the jury already heard through witness\n\ntestimony in the closing).      The record reveals that the comment\n\ndefendant identifies referred to his continued assistance of Soto\n\neven after his murder conviction.       There was nothing improper in\n\nstating a fact that had already been entered into the record,\n\nparticularly since the comment did not implicate defendant in any\n\nmurder.   The charge of conspiracy was, in context, related to\n\ndefendant's role as Soto's second in command for a certain period\n\nof time, which included the time Soto was on probation, under house\n\narrest for first degree murder.\n\n          Moreover, at the beginning of the trial, counsel agreed\n\nthat while certain murders would not be mentioned to the jury,\n\nthere were some murders incidental to the conspiracy which would be\n\nentered into evidence.       Because there was a specific agreement\n\nbetween the parties, we are convinced this could not rise to any\n\nerror on the part of the district court.         See Casas, 356 F.3d at\n\n126 (where defendant specifically agreed to let the court inform\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fthe jury about a plea agreement -- which contained mention of\n\nmurders -- objections are waived).\n\n          3.   Improper Appeal to Jury's Passion And Prejudice\n\n          Defendant   argues   that   the   cumulative   effect   of   the\n\nclosing was to inflame the jury's passions to deprive him of a fair\n\ntrial.   Defendant argues that the closing, as excerpted below,\n\nincited the jury to find him guilty.\n\n          [T]here's going to be argument, oh, they were\n          really bad people, they would rob, all they\n          did was sell drugs, and they would consume\n          drugs. But when you hear that argument, ask\n          yourself, people like Borrero, who was he\n          selling drugs for? [Defendant]. People who\n          are smarter than him. People who have better\n          opportunities than people like [Borrero] that\n          just grew up at the Ceiba Housing Project,\n          that never had an education, never had an\n          opportunity.\n                 And you think about Alexander Figueroa.\n          Oh, he's a convicted murderer.    And yes, he\n          is, and he's a despicable human being, a\n          person that had no pity for people like\n          Jeannette, the 19-year-old girl that he\n          carjacked. When you examine his testimony, I\n          invite you, ladies and gentlemen, to consider\n          what has Alex Figueroa done all his life?\n          Since he was 12 years old, all he did was\n          consume narcotics, 'meterse drogas' as they\n          say, and rob. And rob for what? To get more\n          money, to get more drugs.\n                 And who was [sic] the drugs he was\n          selling for?   [Defendant].   I submit to you\n          when you consider credibility, you say\n          Alexander Figueroa is real bad, we agree he is\n          real bad. But who was he doing that for? For\n          people like [defendant], that you heard\n          evidence, even from [defense] witnesses, that\n          had better opportunities in life. That's who\n          he was selling drugs for.\n\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\f            These statements are of the species of commentary that\n\nmay inflame the jury's passion.        Not only was the issue of drug\n\ntrafficking addressed as social malaise, but it seemed to introduce\n\nan element of social standing into the closing -- that defendant\n\nwas more guilty than the others because he had had the opportunity\n\nto do something with his life, but instead chose drug trafficking.\n\nWe cannot say, however, that \"[t]hese comments interjected issues\n\nhaving no    bearing   on   the   defendant's   guilt   or   innocence   and\n\nimproperly appealed to the jury to act in ways other than as\n\ndispassionate arbiters of the facts.\" United States v. Mooney, 315\n\nF.3d 54, 59 (1st Cir. 2002)(citations omitted).          Defendant relies\n\non United States v. Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d 525, 527 (1st Cir.\n\n1993), which found that the prosecutor's highly emotional argument,\n\ncoupled with the lack of a curative instruction, was reversible\n\nerror. Id.     Determining whether the comments are objectionable is\n\nnot the end of the inquiry.         \"Improper remarks are grounds for\n\nreversal only if they 'so poisoned the well' as to have likely\n\naffected the trial's outcome.\"        Mooney, 315 F.3d at 60 (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Cartagena-Carrasquillo, 70 F.3d 713 706, 713 (1st\n\nCir. 1995)).     We cannot say these closing remarks would have\n\naffected the trial's outcome.       The comments were brief, isolated,\n\nand repetitive of witnesses' own testimony during the government's\n\ncase in chief.   Mooney, 315 F.3d at 60.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f               Defendant also argues that the prosecution, in closing,\n\nimproperly referred to defendant's testimony, intimating it was\n\nuntruthful.      The prosecutor stated \"[w]ho has the most interest in\n\nthe outcome of this case? [Defendant], who takes the stand and\n\ntells you, ladies and gentlemen, that [Soto's] dad asked him to go\n\nvisit him in jail so he can talk to him.\"              However, on this issue,\n\nas above, the government argues that the defense had put every\n\nwitnesses's credibility at issue.               Under such circumstances, this\n\ntype of reference cannot fairly be construed as an inappropriate\n\nreference to defendant's credibility.              See Pérez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d at\n\n9-10.\n\n               Finally, defendant argues that, given the prosecution's\n\nbehavior during the trial, he was denied a fair trial.                     We have\n\nheld    that    \"individual      errors    insufficient     of     themselves    to\n\nnecessitate      a   new     trial   may   in    the   aggregate    have   a    more\n\ndebilitating effect.\"          United States v. Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d 1161,\n\n1195-96 (1st Cir. 1993).             Defendant argues that this was such a\n\ncase    because:     there    was    sufficient    reason   to   disbelieve     the\n\ngovernment's witnesses given their strong incentives to testify\n\nagainst defendant; witnesses' testimony had factual errors; they\n\nwere all housed in the same federal prison; and the prosecution had\n\nno physical evidence against defendant. Since we believe no errors\n\nwere committed in the course of the trial, defendant's argument\n\nregarding due process fails.\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fC.   Sentencing\n\n           Following the jury verdict, the defendant's case was\n\ntransferred to a sentencing judge who reviewed the trial transcript\n\nand imposed a sentence based on the United States Sentencing\n\nGuidelines (\"USSG\").      The sentencing judge accepted the pre-\n\nsentence report's (\"PSR\") drug quantity recommendation of five to\n\nfifteen kilograms, and imposed a three-level enhancement under USSG\n\n§ 3B1.1(b) for the defendant's role in the offense and a two-level\n\nenhancement under USSG § 2D1.1(b)(1) for weapon possession.     The\n\nresulting sentencing range was 210 to 262 months.     The applicable\n\nrange was reduced to 210 to 240 months because of the twenty-year\n\nstatutory maximum.3    21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C).   The judge imposed\n\na sentence of 210 months in prison and three years of supervised\n\nrelease.   The defendant objected to all three of the sentencing\n\njudge's findings in a written response to the PSR, arguing, with\n\nreferences to Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), that\n\nimposition of a sentence based on facts not found by a jury\n\nconstituted a violation of his due process rights.\n\n           Both parties submitted supplemental briefing following\n\nthe Supreme Court's decisions in Blakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct.\n\n2531 (2004), and United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).\n\nThe defendant argues that the sentencing judge violated the rule\n\n\n\n3\n   Without the findings in question, the Guidelines sentencing\nrange would have been ten to sixteen months.\n\n                                -18-\n\fannounced in Booker by imposing a sentence on the basis of a\n\nmandatory Guidelines system, and that the sentence should therefore\n\nbe vacated and the case remanded for resentencing.\n\n             The Booker holding applies to all cases, like the present\n\none, pending on direct review at the time it was decided.      125 S.\n\nCt. at 769.     In United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 76\n\n(1st Cir. 2005), we concluded that \"[t]he argument that a Booker\n\nerror occurred is preserved if the defendant below argued Apprendi\n\nor Blakely error or that the Guidelines were unconstitutional.\"\n\nId. In the pre-Blakely sentencing proceedings below, the defendant\n\nargued, citing Apprendi, that imposition of a Guidelines sentence\n\nbased on facts not found by the jury was unconstitutional.      Thus,\n\nunder the liberal standard of Antonakopoulos, the Booker error was\n\npreserved.\n\n          In its supplemental brief on Booker, the government\n\nconcedes the error was preserved, but, for the first time, argues\n\nthat the defendant has waived the Blakely/Booker argument by\n\nfailing to raise it in his initial brief on appeal.4    While we have\n\n\n4\n   The government notes, further, that defendant's opening brief\nacknowledged that \"the sentencing judge correctly determined that\nunder Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S 466 (2000), the maximum\nsentence was 20 years, under 21 U.S.C. § 846.\" This assertion --\ncontained in a footnote describing the sentencing judge's correct\napplication, due to the absence of a specific quantity in the\nindictment or jury findings, of the statutory sentencing range for\nan uncharged quantity of drugs -- was not addressed to the\nimplications of Apprendi for the constitutionality of Guidelines\nenhancements based on judge-found facts. We therefore do not read\nit as waiving or forfeiting the constitutional objections\n\n                                  -19-\n\foften reiterated that issues raised only in a reply brief or at\n\noral argument are generally considered waived, we will exercise our\n\ndiscretion to consider new issues under exceptional circumstances.\n\nSee, e.g., N. Am. Specialty Ins. Co. v. Lapalme, 258 F.3d 35, 45\n\n(1st Cir. 2001) (\"[A]bsent exceptional circumstances, an appellant\n\ncannot raise an argument for the first time in a reply brief.\").\n\nIn the instant case, the parties' briefs were submitted prior to a\n\nsubstantial change in the applicable law wrought by the Supreme\n\nCourt's decisions in Blakely and Booker.     This change constitutes\n\nan \"exceptional circumstance\" in which we will permit new issues to\n\nbe raised, and we accordingly accepted supplemental briefing from\n\nboth   sides.   See   DSC   Communications   Corp.   v.   Next   Level\n\nCommunications, 107 F.3d 322, 326 n.2 (5th Cir. 1997) (finding\n\nissue raised only in supplemental brief not waived because \"[w]e\n\nare unwilling to ignore [an] important clarification of the law,\n\nand perpetuate incorrect law, merely because [a controlling case]\n\nwas decided after briefing and oral argument in this case\"); cf.\n\nAnderson v. Beatrice Foods Co., 900 F.2d 388, 397 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(finding argument waived because, inter alia, appellant \"did not\n\nmake it in the supplemental briefing before us\"). Likewise, in our\n\nrecent decision in United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix, 400 F.3d 50\n\n(1st Cir. 2005), another panel of this court considered the merits\n\nof a Booker argument not raised in appellant's opening brief.      See\n\n\nunderlying the instant Booker argument.\n\n                               -20-\n\fSupplementa1 Brief for Appellee at 7, United States v. Serrano-\n\nBeauvaix, 400 F.3d 50 (1st Cir. 2005) (No. 02-2286) (arguing that\n\nBooker argument was waived due to failure to assert in opening\n\nbrief).    Thus, we will proceed to review the defendant's preserved\n\nBooker claim.\n\n            1.   Standard of review\n\n            As we indicated in Antonakopoulos, the Booker error \"is\n\nnot that a judge (by a preponderance of the evidence) determined\n\nfacts under the Guidelines which increased a sentence beyond that\n\nauthorized by the jury verdict or an admission by the defendant;\n\nthe error is only that the judge did so in a mandatory Guidelines\n\nsystem.\"    399 F.3d at 75.   Nevertheless, the Supreme Court drew a\n\ndistinction in Booker between those cases in which the sentencing\n\ncourt erred only in applying mandatory Guidelines, and those with\n\nan underlying constitutional violation, in which the mandatory\n\nGuidelines sentence was based in part on facts not admitted by the\n\ndefendant or found by a jury.         125 S. Ct. at 769 (vacating both\n\ndefendants' sentences while recognizing that Booker's sentence\n\nviolated the Sixth Amendment but Fanfan's, which was based solely\n\non the facts found by the jury, did not).         The Court instructed\n\nthat we \"must apply [Booker's] holdings -- both the Sixth Amendment\n\nholding and our remedial interpretation of the Sentencing Act -- to\n\nall cases on direct review.\"    Id.     Nevertheless, the Supreme Court\n\ndid not anticipate that all Booker errors would require remand and\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fresentencing, in part \"because, in cases not involving a Sixth\n\nAmendment violation, whether resentencing is warranted or whether\n\nit   will    instead    be    sufficient      to    review   a      sentence     for\n\nreasonableness may depend upon application of the harmless-error\n\ndoctrine.\"    Id.\n\n            The defendant seizes on this sentence, arguing that it\n\nimplies that cases that do involve a Sixth Amendment violation\n\nmust be automatically remanded, without harmless error review.                    We\n\nagree that the defendant's sentence involved a Sixth Amendment\n\nviolation within the meaning of Booker: neither the drug quantity,\n\nthe defendant's role in the offense, nor his responsibility for the\n\npossession of a firearm by a co-conspirator were admitted by the\n\ndefendant or found by the jury.            Nevertheless, we disagree that\n\nharmless error review is inapplicable to such cases.\n\n             The   language   the     defendant    relies    upon    from    Booker\n\nanticipates    the     outcome   of    harmless     error    review     in     cases\n\nchallenging only the mandatory application of the Guidelines, but\n\nit does not preclude harmless error review of cases involving an\n\nunderlying Sixth Amendment violation.5             The Supreme Court has made\n\n\n5\n   The defendant's references to Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S.\n275 (1993) are not on point.             Sullivan addressed the\ninapplicability of constitutional harmless error review to a jury\nconviction made without an adequate reasonable doubt instruction.\nA reviewing court cannot determine that the same verdict would have\nbeen rendered had the proper instruction been given, without itself\nviolating the constitutional guarantee of a jury trial. Id. at\n279.   With Booker error, in contrast, we are dealing with the\ndecision process of a sentencing judge. It may well be possible to\n\n                                       -22-\n\fclear that not all errors of constitutional dimension require\n\nautomatic reversal. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 22 (1967).\n\nAs we explained in Antonakopoulos, it is not certain that a\n\nsentence would always be different under the advisory regime.                     399\n\nF.3d at 80.     Indeed, sometimes the opposite may be clear, as when\n\na sentencing judge has explicitly stated that he would impose the\n\nsame   sentence   even      if   he   had    discretion     to   depart   from    the\n\nGuidelines.     See, e.g., United States v. Carpenter, -- F.3d --,\n\n2005 WL 708335, at *5 (1st Cir. Mar. 29, 2005) (finding no plain\n\nerror where sentencing judge stated that, even if he had discretion\n\ndepart from a Guidelines sentence, he would not do so).                   Moreover,\n\neven when it involves an underlying Sixth Amendment violation,\n\nBooker error is not structural in nature.                 Id. at 80 n.11.     Thus,\n\npreserved Booker error does not require an automatic remand, but\n\nmust be reviewed for harmlessness.                See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a)\n\n(error not affecting substantial rights shall be disregarded).\n\n            The burden of proving that the preserved Booker error did\n\nnot    affect   the   defendant's      substantial        rights   lies   with    the\n\ngovernment.     See Chapman, 386 U.S. at 24.              The standard of proof,\n\nhowever,    depends    on    whether        the   error    is    conceived   of   as\n\nconstitutional.       Compare id. (\"[B]efore a federal constitutional\n\nerror can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a\n\n\ndetermine, on the basis of the judge's articulated rationale,\nwhether the same sentence would have been imposed under an advisory\nGuidelines regime.\n\n                                        -23-\n\fbelief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\") (emphasis\n\nadded), with Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 764-65\n\n(1946) (determining that error is not harmless if court \"is left in\n\ngrave doubt\"); see also O'Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, 437-38\n\n(1995) (comparing Chapman and Kotteakos standards).             Since we have\n\ndescribed the Booker error as the mandatory application of the\n\nGuidelines, and since under an advisory Guidelines regime a judge\n\nmay   make   findings   of      fact    without      falling   afoul   of   the\n\nConstitution,6   one    might    surmise      that    Booker   error   is   not\n\nconstitutional error.     This conclusion would be incorrect in the\n\ninstant case, where a mandatory Guidelines sentence was imposed on\n\nthe basis of judge-found facts.7              Mandatory application of the\n\nGuidelines in such a case violates the defendant's Sixth Amendment\n\n\n6\n   As the Second Circuit explained in United States v. Crosby, 397\nF.3d 103, 109 n.6, (2d Cir. 2005), \"[a]s a result of the Remedy\nOpinion in Booker . . . the maximum lawful sentence is the\nstatutory maximum sentence, and because judicial fact-finding under\nadvisory guidelines cannot increase that lawful maximum, judicial\nfact-finding now encounters no Sixth Amendment difficulties.\" See\nBooker, 125 S. Ct. at 750 (\"[W]hen a trial judge exercises his\ndiscretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range,\nthe defendant has no right to a jury determination of the facts\nthat the judge deems relevant.\") (Stevens, J.); id. at 764\n(\"[W]ithout this provision . . . that makes the relevant sentencing\nrules . . . mandatory and impose[s] binding requirement[s] on all\nsentencing judges -- the [Guidelines] statute falls outside the\nscope of Apprendi's requirement.\") (Breyer, J.).\n7\n   We express no opinion as to whether Booker error arising out of\nthe mandatory application of the Guidelines alone, without any\nunderlying Sixth Amendment violation, is constitutional in nature.\nCf. United States v. Haidley, 400 F.3d 642, 645 (8th Cir. 2005)\n(declining to determine whether such error \"was of constitutional\nmagnitude\").\n\n                                       -24-\n\frights.    See Booker 125 S. Ct. at 756.           Because the defendant was\n\n\"denied a federal constitutional right,\"             Chapman 386 U.S. at 20,\n\nthe government has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat the error did not affect the defendant's substantial rights.\n\nId. at 24; see also United States v. Pérez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d 1, 17\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (applying Chapman harmless error standard to\n\nApprendi violation).      That is, we must be convinced that a lower\n\nsentence would not have been imposed had the Guidelines been\n\nadvisory.    This is an extremely difficult, but not impossible,\n\nstandard to meet. While the government, in light of the difficulty\n\nof meeting its burden, has on occasion conceded to remand for\n\nBooker error, see, e.g., United States v. Mercado Irizarry, -- F.3d\n\n--, 2005 WL 825747, at *4 (1st Cir. Apr. 11, 2005), it has not done\n\nso here.\n\n            2.    Harmless error\n\n            The    government    contends    that    the   sentencing      judge's\n\nbelief that the Guidelines were mandatory did not contribute to the\n\ndefendant's sentence, but it has failed to meet its heavy burden of\n\nproving this claim beyond a reasonable doubt.                 In support of its\n\nposition,    the    government     refers    to     statements      made   by   the\n\nsentencing judge that suggest he was convinced of the factual basis\n\nfor the enhancements he applied.            But even if, as the government\n\nfurther    alleges,    each   factor   were       supported    by    overwhelming\n\nevidence, factual certainty alone would not be sufficient to show\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fbeyond a reasonable doubt that the judge, acting under an advisory\n\nGuidelines system, would have applied the same sentence on the\n\nbasis of those factors.      In the instant case, the government has\n\npointed to no statement or action of the sentencing judge that\n\nwould assure us that he would have imposed the same sentence in the\n\nabsence of mandatory Guidelines.            To the contrary, our doubt on\n\nthis point is enhanced by the fact that, while the applicable\n\nGuidelines constrained the sentencing judge to the upper margin of\n\nsentences available under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C), the sentence he\n\nchose was at the low end of that margin.\n\n             Finally, the government suggests that we may find the\n\nBooker error harmless if we determine that the resulting sentence\n\nis reasonable.      See Booker, 125 S. Ct. at 767 (\"The district\n\ncourts, while not bound by the Guidelines, must consult those\n\nGuidelines and take them into account when sentencing.            The courts\n\nof appeals review sentencing decisions for unreasonableness.\")\n\n(internal citation omitted).     This argument is without merit.        The\n\nreasonableness standard is to be used in reviewing sentences\n\nimposed in compliance with Booker. See id. at 769 (suggesting that\n\nif Booker error is harmless in cases not involving Sixth Amendment\n\nviolation,    resulting   sentence    may    only   require   reasonableness\n\nreview).     The defendant's sentence did not comply with Booker.\n\nEven if we determined that a 210 month sentence was reasonable\n\nbased on the facts considered at sentencing, we could not rule out\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\fthe possibility that, under advisory Guidelines, the sentencing\n\njudge would have imposed a lower reasonable sentence.                   Thus, we\n\nhold that the government has failed to meet its burden of showing\n\nthat the Booker error was harmless.\n\n           3.   Remedy\n\n           Two distinct options are available to remedy preserved\n\nBooker error that has not been proven harmless.              We can vacate the\n\nsentence and remand for resentencing, or we can follow the lead of\n\nthe Second Circuit and remand for a determination of whether the\n\nsentencing judge would have applied a different sentence under an\n\nadvisory Guidelines regime. See Crosby, 397 F.3d 116-18. Although\n\nthe Second Circuit deemed a Crosby remand \"appropriate in order to\n\nundertake a proper application of the plain error and harmless\n\nerror   doctrines,\"      id.   at   117,   it   has   only   been     applied   in\n\nunpreserved error cases, and appears to have been directed largely\n\nat avoiding construing doubt about prejudice in the context of\n\nplain   error   review    against    defendants,      see    United    States   v.\n\nWilliams, 399 F.3d 450, 457-61 (2d Cir. 2005).8              Nevertheless, the\n\nCrosby remand does have the added benefits of avoiding the need to\n\n\n\n8\n   We note that the Seventh Circuit has also developed a partial-\nremand procedure for determining prejudice in cases of unpreserved\nBooker error. See United States v. Paladino, 401 F.3d 471, 483-84\n(7th Cir. 2005).   It did not, however, apply that procedure to\nremedy a finding that a preserved Booker error was not harmless,\nopting instead to vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.\nSee United States v. Schlifer, -- F.3d --, 2005 WL 774914, at *5\n(7th Cir. Apr. 7, 2005).\n\n                                      -27-\n\fconvene a resentencing hearing -- a much more administratively\n\ntaxing event than a sentencing judge's reevaluation on a Crosby\n\nremand -- in cases where the sentencing judge determines that the\n\nsame sentence would have been imposed under advisory Guidelines.\n\nId. at 459.      It also avoids, again in cases where the sentence\n\nwould not have changed, the quandary of whether aggravating or\n\nmitigating facts that have arisen since the original sentencing can\n\nbe considered.     Id.\n\n             Despite these advantages, we decline to engage in this\n\nsort    of   limited   remand   for   preserved   Booker    error   when   the\n\ngovernment has failed to prove harmlessness.         We do not anticipate\n\nthat there will be so many such cases that reconvening sentencing\n\nhearings will create a significant administrative burden.                  And,\n\nwhile    the    problem   of    newly   arisen    sentencing    factors     is\n\nsignificant, it will have to be addressed if a sentencing court\n\ndetermines that a different sentence would have been imposed under\n\nadvisory Guidelines.      Thus, we cannot be certain of avoiding the\n\nproblem with Crosby remands.\n\n             Given the limited benefit of Crosby remands in the\n\ncontext of preserved error, we prefer to follow a more traditional\n\nroute.       Although this is a case of first impression, roughly\n\nanalogous precedent exists in those cases where we have found that\n\nthe sentencing judge mistakenly believed that he was without\n\nauthority to depart from a Guidelines sentence.            See United States\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\fv. Delgado-Reyes, 245 F.3d 20 (1st Cir. 2001); Mariano v. United\n\nStates, 983 F.2d 1150 (1st Cir. 1993).     In both cases, despite the\n\npossibility that the judge might have opted not to depart, we\n\nvacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing.       See Delgado-\n\nReyes, 245 F.3d at 23-24 (remanding because sentencing judge\n\n\"seemed inclined\" to accept joint stipulation that lower range\n\napplied); Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1150 (remanding where we were\n\n\"unable confidently to say . . . that the judge's error was\n\nharmless\").   We will do the same here.\n\n           Because we remand for resentencing under Booker, we will\n\nnot consider the defendant's remaining claim that the facts found\n\nby   the   sentencing   judge   are   insufficient   to   support   the\n\nenhancements applied.    The new sentence will, however, be subject\n\nto reasonableness review should it be challenged in the future.\n\nBooker, 125 S. Ct. at 765.\n\n                                 III.\n\n           For the reasons stated above, we affirm the defendant's\n\nconviction, but vacate his sentence.      We remand to the district\n\ncourt for resentencing in accordance with the Sentencing Reform Act\n\nof 1984, Pub. L. 98-473, Title II, §§ 211-238, 98 Stat. 1987\n\n(1984), as altered in Booker.\n\n           Affirmed, Vacated and Remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -29-\n\f",

Jos&#233; Borrero Feliciano (\"Borrero\") testified that, after he was released from prison in 1991, he approached defendant about working for him in the drug business. Borrero stated that, after defendant consulted with Roberto Soto And&#243;n (\"Soto\"), he began selling cocaine and heroin on behalf of defendant and Soto. According to Borrero, defendant told him that he was in charge of the drug point at the La Ceiba Housing Project in Ponce, Puerto Rico (\"the Ceiba drug point\"). Borrero stated that he never saw defendant sell drugs on the street, but that he went to defendant's home to replenish his drug supplies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alberto Negr&#243;n Constantino (\"Negr&#243;n\") testified that he met defendant in 1995 and sold him cocaine and heroin for distribution by Soto's drug operation. Negr&#243;n initially sold cocaine and heroin to defendant's brother V&#237;ctor V&#225;zquez Rivera. In late 1996 or early 1997, Negr&#243;n began working for Soto. According to Negr&#243;n, Soto removed defendant as the head of the Ceiba drug point. Negr&#243;n then took over the Ceiba drug point and began purchasing the cocaine and heroin for the drug point himself. Another co-conspirator, Daniel S&#225;nchez Ortiz (\"S&#225;nchez\"), testified that he was a drug runner in the Soto organization and that he bought and sold drugs from defendant's brother. While S&#225;nchez never dealt directly with defendant, he was instructed by V&#237;ctor V&#225;zquez Rivera that he was acting on behalf of defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another witness, Edwin Mel&#233;ndez Negr&#243;n, stated that he had been supplied drugs by defendant for his drug point elsewhere in the Ponce area. In addition, he testified that he went to Las Cucharas jail in Ponce, Puerto Rico with defendant to visit Soto while he was confined there. Alexander Figueroa Delgado testified that he lived for about a month with a cousin who sold heroin for defendant. Finally, Yazmin Laracuente Alameda testified that after her husband was arrested on drug charges, she began selling cocaine for defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant appealed from the jury verdict, alleging the following: (1) improper testimony from a government witness; (2) the prosecutor's closing arguments were rife with error; and (3) defendant's sentence was improperly enhanced. In supplemental briefing, defendant also appealed his sentence on the basis that it was imposed in violation of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).

Improper Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues on appeal that the case agent, Iv&#225;n Lugo, gave improper vouching testimony. Because there was no contemporaneous objection, we review for plain error. To show plain error, a defendant must show that an error occurred, which was clear and obvious; and that it affected defendant's substantial rights and seriously impaired the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the public proceedings. <i>See United States v. P&#233;rez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that the testimony of Agent Lugo was improper because, in the course of rebuttal, the prosecution twice elicited a statement from Lugo purporting to \"certify\" that V&#237;ctor V&#225;zquez Rivera, defendant's brother, would not have received a safety valve credit if he had not incriminated the defendant. Further, defendant argues, it was improper to allow testimony that Agent Lugo \"already knew\" that defendant was involved in drug trafficking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Improper vouching occurs when \"prosecutors ... place the prestige of the United States behind a witness by making personal assurances of credibility or by suggesting that facts not before the jury support the witness's account.\" <i>United States v.

The statements that defendant objects to on appeal were given after defendant's brother, V&#237;tor V&#225;zquez Rivera, testified for the defense. V&#237;ctor V&#225;zquez Rivera testified that his brother was not involved in Roberto Soto's operations and that he had never distributed cocaine or heroin. In order to impeach V&#225;zquez Rivera's testimony, the government called Agent Lugo to the stand again. He testified to the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q [by AUSA]: Sir, did you have an opportunity to interview V&#237;ctor V&#225;zquez Rivera?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agent Lugo: Yes, ma'am.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: And what was the purpose of that interview?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: It was a safety valve debriefing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Please explain to the members of the jury, what is a safety valve debriefing?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Safety valve debriefing is an opportunity for the defendant [referring to V&#237;ctor V&#225;zquez Rivera] to speak to the government and give us his admissions of their [sic] criminal activities.

The first thing that I remember in reference to that is when I started talking to him about his brother and Robert[o Soto-And&#243;n], he refused to talk.

Defendant's argument fails because Agent Lugo was not attempting to bolster the credibility of any witness, he was merely explaining the procedure under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f). Agent Lugo was not, as defendant suggests, stating that V&#237;ctor V&#225;zquez Rivera told the truth at the safety valve hearing, although that is its purpose. <i>See generally United States v. Matos,</i> 328 F.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir.2003)(stating that \"a safety valve debriefing is a situation that cries out for straight talk; equivocations, half-truths, and veiled allusions will not do\"). Instead, the statement was introduced to show that V&#237;ctor V&#225;zquez Rivera gave a prior inconsistent statement to Agent Lugo, which contradicted his testimony during the trial. The statement was couched in terms of the certification, but that was not meant to imply that the government was vouching for V&#237;ctor V&#225;zquez Rivera's credibility; in fact, it sought the opposite-to impeach by providing a statement which contradicted his trial testimony. <i>Cf. P&#233;rez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d at 12 (the prohibition on vouching extends to propping up a dubious witness through the testimony of a government agent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also objects to the agent's testimony regarding his knowledge of the drug operation as inadmissible hearsay, and points to <i>United States v. Casas,</i> 356 F.3d 104 (1st Cir.2004), as analogous to this appeal. In <i>Casas,</i> we held that the testimony of a government agent that the defendants were members of a drug conspiracy was inadmissible hearsay. <i>Id.</i> at 117-18. Defendant's argument must be rejected, however, because here the statement was not offered to prove that a conspiracy existed, but only to explain why the agent's notes had omitted certain information. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 801(c)(stating that hearsay is \"a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted\"). In <i>Casas,</i> the testimony was given by the case agent to prove that the conspiracy existed. <i>Id.</i> at 118 (stating that the agent testified as to the existence of the drug trafficking organization, that all four defendants were members and that the organization handled cocaine and heroin). It was found to be reversible error to admit the testimonial statement in that case because it sought to establish the existence of the conspiracy, <i>i.e.,</i> the ultimate issue in the case, before the jury had made that determination. Here, as the statement was not offered for its truth, it is not hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also argues that the statement regarding the safety valve hearing was improper hearsay testimony. Where, as here, a statement is introduced to impeach a statement that a witness provided on direct examination, the statement is admissible for that purpose. The government argues that the evidence is admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 613(b), which provides for the admissibility of extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness as long as the witness is afforded an opportunity to explain or deny his statement. <i>See United States v. Winchenbach,</i> 197 F.3d 548, 558 (1st Cir.1999)(holding that \"comparison and contradiction are the hallmarks of Rule 613(b)\"). In this case, V&#237;ctor V&#225;zquez Rivera testified and was cross-examined and had ample opportunity to explain himself. <i>Id.</i> at 559.

Closing Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that the Assistant United States Attorney engaged in prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument and rebuttal. Because there was no objection made in the district court during the closing argument, we review only for plain error. <i>See P&#233;rez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d at 9 (citing <i>United States v.

Defendant argues that the government put its prestige behind V&#237;ctor V&#225;zquez Rivera's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that under <i>United States v.

Manning,</i> 23 F.3d 570, 572-73 (1st Cir.1994), this type of vouching amounts to prosecutorial misconduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In <i>P&#233;rez-Ruiz,</i> we made clear that any dictum from <i>Auch,</i> which \"rest[ed] on an understandable misreading of [<i>Manning</i>],\" was disclaimed. <i>P&#233;rez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d at 10 (stating that the statements made in <i>Auch</i> were not good law). During the course of the trial, defendant questioned the veracity of every witness in the government's case in chief, charging them with bias resulting from their negotiated plea and cooperating agreements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The closing argument was \"a logical counter to the assertions of defense counsel, made in summation, that various government witnesses had fabricated their testimony because they wanted the [defendant] behind bars and would stop at nothing to put him there. We typically cede prosecutors some latitude in responding to defense counsel's allegations of fabrication.\" <i>P&#233;rez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d at 9-10. Given the defense's strategy, we believe that the prosecutor was directly addressing defendant's numerous allegations of fabrication and not improperly vouching for witnesses by placing the government's prestige behind them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Reference to murder conviction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that the prosecution made a gratuitous reference to Soto's murder conviction by saying that he was serving time for murder when defendant visited him at Las Cucharas and that the prosecutor argued guilt by association. \"A defendant is entitled to have the question of his guilt determined by the evidence against him, not on whether a co-defendant or government witness has been convicted of the same charge.\" <i>United States v. Dworken,</i> 855 F.2d 12, 30 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first day of trial, the government and defendant informed the judge that they had reached an agreement not to mention most or any murders that involved witnesses. Soto was convicted of first degree murder and released on probation before the conspiracy at issue here began. The government's theory of the case involved the defendant's visits to Soto's house, in particular where he went with a government witness during Soto's probation. Defendant concedes that this association was relevant to the conspiracy, but argues that there was no need to mention the conviction and the only reason that the prosecutor did so was so the jury would be more likely to convict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that evidence of the murder conviction was already entered into the record through the testimony of several witnesses. <i>See United States v. McKeeve,</i> 131 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir.1997)(holding that a prosecutor may accurately describe the testimony the jury already heard through witness testimony in the closing). The record reveals that the comment defendant identifies referred to his continued assistance of Soto even after his murder conviction. There was nothing improper in stating a fact that had already been entered into the record, particularly since the comment did not implicate defendant in any murder. The charge of conspiracy was, in context, related to defendant's role as Soto's second in command for a certain period of time, which included the time Soto was on probation, under house arrest for first degree murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, at the beginning of the trial, counsel agreed that while certain murders would not be mentioned to the jury, there were some murders incidental to the conspiracy which would be entered into evidence. Because there was a specific agreement between the parties, we are convinced this could not rise to any error on the part of the district court. <i>See Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 126 (where defendant specifically agreed to let the court inform the jury about a plea agreement&#8212;which contained mention of murders&#8212;objections are waived).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Improper Appeal to Jury's Passion And Prejudice</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that the cumulative effect of the closing was to inflame the jury's passions to deprive him of a fair trial. Defendant argues that the closing, as excerpted below, incited the jury to find him guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]here's going to be argument, oh, they were really bad people, they would rob, all they did was sell drugs, and they would consume drugs. But when you hear that argument, ask yourself, people like Borrero, who was he selling drugs for? [Defendant]. People who are smarter than him. People who have better opportunities than people like [Borrero] that just grew up at the Ceiba Housing Project, that never had an education, never had an opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And you think about Alexander Figueroa. Oh, he's a convicted murderer. And yes, he is, and he's a despicable human being, a person that had no pity for people like Jeannette, the 19-year-old girl that he carjacked. When you examine his testimony, I invite you, ladies and gentlemen, to consider what has Alex Figueroa done all his life? Since he was 12 years old, all he did was consume narcotics, `meterse drogas' as they say, and rob. And rob for what? To get more money, to get more drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And who was [sic] the drugs he was selling for? [Defendant]. I submit to you when you consider credibility, you say Alexander Figueroa is real bad, we agree he is real bad. But who was he doing that for? For people like [defendant], that you heard evidence, even from [defense] witnesses, that had better opportunities in life. That's who he was selling drugs for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These statements are of the species of commentary that may inflame the jury's passion. Not only was the issue of drug trafficking addressed as social malaise, but it seemed to introduce an element of social standing into the closing&#8212;that defendant was more guilty than the others because he had had the opportunity to do something with his life, but instead chose drug trafficking. We cannot say, however, that \"[t]hese comments interjected issues having no bearing on the defendant's guilt or innocence and improperly appealed to the jury to act in ways other than as dispassionate arbiters of the facts.\" <i>United States v. Mooney,</i> 315 F.3d 54, 59 (1st Cir.2002) (citations omitted). Defendant relies on <i>United States v. Arrieta-Agressot,</i> 3 F.3d 525, 527 (1st Cir.1993), which found that the prosecutor's highly emotional argument, coupled with the lack of a curative instruction, was reversible error. <i>Id.</i> Determining whether the comments are objectionable is not the end of the inquiry. \"Improper remarks are grounds for reversal only if they `so poisoned the well' as to have likely affected the trial's outcome.\" <i>Mooney,</i> 315 F.3d at 60 (quoting <i>United States v. Cartagena-Carrasquillo,</i> 70 F.3d 706, 713 (1st Cir.1995)). We cannot say these closing remarks would have affected the trial's outcome. The comments were brief, isolated, and repetitive of witnesses' own testimony during the government's case in chief. <i>Mooney,</i> 315 F.3d at 60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also argues that the prosecution, in closing, improperly referred to defendant's testimony, intimating it was untruthful. The prosecutor stated \"[w]ho has the most interest in the outcome of this case? [Defendant], who takes the stand and tells you, ladies and gentlemen, that [Soto's] dad asked him to go visit him in jail so he can talk to him.\" However, on this issue, as above, the government argues that the defense had put every witnesses's credibility at issue. Under such circumstances, this type of reference cannot fairly be construed as an inappropriate reference to defendant's credibility. <i>See P&#233;rez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d at 9-10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defendant argues that, given the prosecution's behavior during the trial, he was denied a fair trial. We have held that \"individual errors insufficient of themselves to necessitate a new trial may in the aggregate have a more debilitating effect.\" <i>United States v. Sep&#250;lveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1195-96 (1st Cir.1993). Defendant argues that this was such a case because: there was sufficient reason to disbelieve the government's witnesses given their strong incentives to testify against defendant; witnesses' testimony had factual errors; they were all housed in the same federal prison; and the prosecution had no physical evidence against defendant. Since we believe no errors were committed in the course of the trial, defendant's argument regarding due process fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the jury verdict, the defendant's case was transferred to a sentencing judge who reviewed the trial transcript and imposed a sentence based on the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"USSG\"). The sentencing judge accepted the pre-sentence report's (\"PSR\") drug quantity recommendation of five to fifteen kilograms, and imposed a three-level enhancement under USSG &#167; 3B1.1(b) for the defendant's role in the offense and a two-level enhancement under USSG &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1) for weapon possession. The resulting sentencing range was 210 to 262 months. The applicable range was reduced to 210 to 240 months because of the twenty-year statutory maximum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C). The judge imposed a sentence of 210 months in prison and three years of supervised release. The defendant objected to all three of the sentencing judge's findings in a written response to the PSR, arguing, with references to <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that imposition of a sentence based on facts not found by a jury constituted a violation of his due process rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties submitted supplemental briefing following the Supreme Court's decisions in <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The defendant argues that the sentencing judge violated the rule announced in <i>Booker</i> by imposing a sentence on the basis of a mandatory Guidelines system, and that the sentence should therefore be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Booker</i> holding applies to all cases, like the present one, pending on direct review at the time it was decided. 125 S.Ct. at 769. In <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir.2005), we concluded that \"[t]he argument that a <i>Booker</i> error occurred is preserved if the defendant below argued <i>Apprendi</i> or <i>Blakely</i> error or that the Guidelines were unconstitutional.\" <i>Id.</i> In the pre-<i>Blakely</i> sentencing proceedings below, the defendant argued, citing <i>Apprendi,</i> that imposition of a Guidelines sentence based on facts not found by the jury was unconstitutional. Thus, under the liberal standard of <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> the <i>Booker</i> error was preserved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its supplemental brief on <i>Booker,</i> the government concedes the error was preserved, but, for the first time, argues that the defendant has waived the <i>Blakely/Booker</i> argument by failing to raise it in his initial brief on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> While we have often reiterated that issues raised only in a reply brief or at oral argument are generally considered waived, we will exercise our discretion to consider new issues under exceptional circumstances. <i>See, e.g., N. Am. Specialty Ins. Co. v. Lapalme,</i> 258 F.3d 35, 45 (1st Cir.2001) (\"[A]bsent exceptional circumstances, an appellant cannot raise an argument for the first time in a reply brief.\"). In the instant case, the parties' briefs were submitted prior to a substantial change in the applicable law wrought by the Supreme Court's decisions in <i>Blakely</i> and <i>Booker.</i> This change constitutes an \"exceptional circumstance\" in which we will permit new issues to be raised, and we accordingly accepted supplemental briefing from both sides. <i>See DSC Communications Corp. v. Next Level Communications,</i> 107 F.3d 322, 326 n. 2 (5th Cir.1997) (finding issue raised only in supplemental brief not waived because \"[w]e are unwilling to ignore [an] important clarification of the law, and perpetuate incorrect law, merely because [a controlling case] was decided after briefing and oral argument in this case\"); <i>cf. Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co.,</i> 900 F.2d 388, 397 (1st Cir.1990) (finding argument waived because, <i>inter alia,</i> appellant \"did not make it in the supplemental briefing before us\"). Likewise, in our recent decision in <i>United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix,</i> 400 F.3d 50 (1st Cir.2005), another panel of this court considered the merits of a <i>Booker</i> argument not raised in appellant's opening brief. <i>See</i> Supplemental Brief for Appellee at 7, <i>United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix,</i> 400 F.3d 50 (1st Cir.2005) (arguing that <i>Booker</i> argument was waived due to failure to assert in opening brief). Thus, we will proceed to review the defendant's preserved <i>Booker</i> claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Standard of review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we indicated in <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> the <i>Booker</i> error \"is not that a judge (by a preponderance of the evidence) determined facts under the Guidelines which increased a sentence beyond that authorized by the jury verdict or an admission by the defendant; the error is only that the judge did so in a mandatory Guidelines system.\" 399 F.3d at 75. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court drew a distinction in <i>Booker</i> between those cases in which the sentencing court erred only in applying mandatory Guidelines, and those with an underlying constitutional violation, in which the mandatory Guidelines sentence was based in part on facts not admitted by the defendant or found by a jury. 125 S.Ct. at 769 (vacating both defendants' sentences while recognizing that Booker's sentence violated the Sixth Amendment but Fanfan's, which was based solely on the facts found by the jury, did not). The Court instructed that we \"must apply [<i>Booker's</i> ] holdings&#8212;both the Sixth Amendment holding and our remedial interpretation of the Sentencing Act&#8212;to all cases on direct review.\" <i>Id.</i> Nevertheless, the Supreme Court did not anticipate that all <i>Booker</i> errors would require remand and resentencing, in part \"because, in cases not involving a Sixth Amendment violation, whether resentencing is warranted or whether it will instead be sufficient to review a sentence for reasonableness may depend upon application of the harmless-error doctrine.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant seizes on this sentence, arguing that it implies that cases that <i>do</i> involve a Sixth Amendment violation must be automatically remanded, without harmless error review. We agree that the defendant's sentence involved a Sixth Amendment violation within the meaning of <i>Booker:</i> neither the drug quantity, the defendant's role in the offense, nor his responsibility for the possession of a firearm by a co-conspirator were admitted by the defendant or found by the jury. Nevertheless, we disagree that harmless error review is inapplicable to such cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language the defendant relies upon from <i>Booker</i> anticipates the outcome of harmless error review in cases challenging only the mandatory application of the Guidelines, but it does not preclude harmless error review of cases involving an underlying Sixth Amendment violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The Supreme Court has made clear that not all errors of constitutional dimension require automatic reversal. <i>Chapman v. California,</i> 386 U.S. 18, 22, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). As we explained in <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> it is not certain that a sentence would always be different under the advisory regime. 399 F.3d at 80. Indeed, sometimes the opposite may be clear, as when a sentencing judge has explicitly stated that he would impose the same sentence even if he had discretion to depart from the Guidelines. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Carpenter,</i> 403 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.2005) (finding no plain error where sentencing judge stated that, even if he had discretion depart from a Guidelines sentence, he would not do so). Moreover, even when it involves an underlying Sixth Amendment violation, <i>Booker</i> error is not structural in nature. <i>Id.</i> at 80 n. 11. Thus, preserved <i>Booker</i> error does not require an automatic remand, but must be reviewed for harmlessness. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) (error not affecting substantial rights shall be disregarded).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The burden of proving that the preserved <i>Booker</i> error did not affect the defendant's substantial rights lies with the government. <i>See Chapman,</i> 386 U.S. at 24, 87 S.Ct. 824. The standard of proof, however, depends on whether the error is conceived of as constitutional. <i>Compare id.</i> (\"[B]efore a federal <i>constitutional error</i> can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\") (emphasis added), <i>with Kotteakos v. United States,</i> 328 U.S. 750, 764-65, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946) (determining that error is not harmless if court \"is left in grave doubt\"); <i>see also O'Neal v. McAninch,</i> 513 U.S. 432, 437-38, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995) (comparing <i>Chapman</i> and <i>Kotteakos</i> standards). Since we have described the <i>Booker</i> error as the mandatory application of the Guidelines, and since under an advisory Guidelines regime a judge may make findings of fact without falling afoul of the Constitution,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> one might surmise that <i>Booker</i> error is not constitutional error. This conclusion would be incorrect in the instant case, where a mandatory Guidelines sentence was imposed on the basis of judge-found facts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Mandatory application of the Guidelines in such a case violates the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. <i>See Booker</i> 125 S.Ct. at 756. Because the defendant was \"denied a federal constitutional right,\" <i>Chapman</i> 386 U.S. at 20, 87 S.Ct. 824, the government has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect the defendant's substantial rights. <i>Id.</i> at 24, 87 S.Ct. 824; <i>see also United States v. P&#233;rez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir.2003) (applying <i>Chapman</i> harmless error standard to <i>Apprendi</i> violation). That is, we must be convinced that a lower sentence would not have been imposed had the Guidelines been advisory. This is an extremely difficult, but not impossible, standard to meet. While the government, in light of the difficulty of meeting its burden, has on occasion conceded to remand for <i>Booker</i> error, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Mercado Irizarry,</i> 404 F.3d 497, 499 (1st Cir.2005), it has not done so here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Harmless error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the sentencing judge's belief that the Guidelines were mandatory did not contribute to the defendant's sentence, but it has failed to meet its heavy burden of proving this claim beyond a reasonable doubt. In support of its position, the government refers to statements made by the sentencing judge that suggest he was convinced of the factual basis for the enhancements he applied. But even if, as the government further alleges, each factor were supported by overwhelming evidence, factual certainty alone would not be sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the judge, acting under an advisory Guidelines system, would have applied the same sentence on the basis of those factors. In the instant case, the government has pointed to no statement or action of the sentencing judge that would assure us that he would have imposed the same sentence in the absence of mandatory Guidelines. To the contrary, our doubt on this point is enhanced by the fact that, while the applicable Guidelines constrained the sentencing judge to the upper margin of sentences available under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C), the sentence he chose was at the low end of that margin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the government suggests that we may find the <i>Booker</i> error harmless if we determine that the resulting sentence is reasonable. <i>See Booker,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 767 (\"The district courts, while not bound by the Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing. The courts of appeals review sentencing decisions for unreasonableness.\") (internal citation omitted). This argument is without merit. The reasonableness standard is to be used in reviewing sentences imposed in compliance with <i>Booker. See id.</i> at 769 (suggesting that if <i>Booker</i> error is harmless in cases not involving Sixth Amendment violation, resulting sentence may only require reasonableness review). The defendant's sentence did not comply with <i>Booker.</i> Even if we determined that a 210 month sentence was reasonable based on the facts considered at sentencing, we could not rule out the possibility that, under advisory Guidelines, the sentencing judge would have imposed a lower reasonable sentence. Thus, we hold that the government has failed to meet its burden of showing that the <i>Booker</i> error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Remedy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two distinct options are available to remedy preserved <i>Booker</i> error that has not been proven harmless. We can vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing, or we can follow the lead of the Second Circuit and remand for a determination of whether the sentencing judge would have applied a different sentence under an advisory Guidelines regime. <i>See Crosby,</i> 397 F.3d at 116-18. Although the Second Circuit deemed a <i>Crosby</i> remand \"appropriate in order to undertake a proper application of the plain error and harmless error doctrines,\" <i>id.</i> at 117, it has only been applied in unpreserved error cases, and appears to have been directed largely at avoiding construing doubt about prejudice in the context of plain error review against defendants, <i>see United States v. Williams,</i> 399 F.3d 450, 457-61 (2d Cir.2005).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Nevertheless, theless, the <i>Crosby</i> remand does have the added benefits of avoiding the need to convene a resentencing hearing &#8212; a much more administratively taxing event than a sentencing judge's reevaluation on a <i>Crosby</i> remand &#8212; in cases where the sentencing judge determines that the same sentence would have been imposed under advisory Guidelines. <i>Id.</i> at 459. It also avoids, again in cases where the sentence would not have changed, the quandary of whether aggravating or mitigating facts that have arisen since the original sentencing can be considered. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these advantages, we decline to engage in this sort of limited remand for preserved <i>Booker</i> error when the government has failed to prove harmlessness. We do not anticipate that there will be so many such cases that reconvening sentencing hearings will create a significant administrative burden. And, while the problem of newly arisen sentencing factors is significant, it will have to be addressed if a sentencing court determines that a different sentence would have been imposed under advisory Guidelines. Thus, we cannot be certain of avoiding the problem with <i>Crosby</i> remands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the limited benefit of <i>Crosby</i> remands in the context of preserved error, we prefer to follow a more traditional route. Although this is a case of first impression, roughly analogous precedent exists in those cases where we have found that the sentencing judge mistakenly believed that he was without authority to depart from a Guidelines sentence. <i>See United States v. Delgado-Reyes,</i> 245 F.3d 20 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Mariano,</i> 983 F.2d 1150 (1st Cir.1993). In both cases, despite the possibility that the judge might have opted not to depart, we vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing. <i>See Delgado-Reyes,</i> 245 F.3d at 23-24 (remanding because sentencing judge \"seemed inclined\" to accept joint stipulation that lower range applied); <i>Mariano,</i> 983 F.2d at 1150 (remanding where we were \"unable confidently to say... that the judge's error was harmless\"). We will do the same here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we remand for resentencing under <i>Booker,</i> we will not consider the defendant's remaining claim that the facts found by the sentencing judge are insufficient to support the enhancements applied. The new sentence will, however, be subject to reasonableness review should it be challenged in the future. <i>Booker,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 765.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the defendant's conviction, but vacate his sentence. We remand to the district court for resentencing in accordance with the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub.L. 98-473, Title II, &#167;&#167; 211-238, 98 Stat.1987 (1984), as altered in <i>Booker.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed, Vacated and Remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n        <p>*Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> \"Square this.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In<i>Manning,</i> this court condemned as vouching a portion of the prosecutor's statement containing the argument that a detective would have created a more damaging story had he intended to fabricate evidence. <i>Manning,</i> 23 F.3d at 572.

We therefore do not read it as waiving or forfeiting the constitutional objections underlying the instant <i>Booker</i> argument.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The defendant's references to<i>Sullivan v.

A reviewing court cannot determine that the same verdict would have been rendered had the proper instruction been given, without itself violating the constitutional guarantee of a jury trial. <i>Id.</i> at 279, 113 S.Ct. 2078. With <i>Booker</i> error, in contrast, we are dealing with the decision process of a sentencing judge.

Borrero stated that, after defendant consulted with Roberto Soto And&#243;n (\"Soto\"), he began selling cocaine and heroin on behalf of defendant and Soto. According to Borrero, defendant told him that he was in charge of the drug point at the La Ceiba Housing Project in Ponce, Puerto Rico (\"the Ceiba drug point\").

According to Negr&#243;n, Soto removed defendant as the head of the Ceiba drug point. Negr&#243;n then took over the Ceiba drug point and began purchasing the cocaine and heroin for the drug point himself. Another co-conspirator, Daniel S&#225;nchez Ortiz (\"S&#225;nchez\"), testified that he was a drug runner in the Soto organization and that he bought and sold drugs from defendant's brother.

Defendant's argument fails because Agent Lugo was not attempting to bolster the credibility of any witness, he was merely explaining the procedure under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f). Agent Lugo was not, as defendant suggests, stating that V&#237;ctor V&#225;zquez Rivera told the truth at the safety valve hearing, although that is its purpose. <i>See generally United States v. Matos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200455\"><a href=\"/opinion/200455/united-states-v-mariel-figueroa/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.2003)(stating that \"a safety valve debriefing is a situation that cries out for straight talk; equivocations, half-truths, and veiled allusions will not do\"). Instead, the statement was introduced to show that V&#237;ctor V&#225;zquez Rivera gave a prior inconsistent statement to Agent Lugo, which contradicted his testimony during the trial. The statement was couched in terms of the certification, but that was not meant to imply that the government was vouching for V&#237;ctor V&#225;zquez Rivera's credibility; in fact, it sought the opposite-to impeach by providing a statement which contradicted his trial testimony. <i>Cf. P&#233;rez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d at 12 (the prohibition on vouching extends to propping up a dubious witness through the testimony of a government agent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also objects to the agent's testimony regarding his knowledge of the drug operation as inadmissible hearsay, and points to <i>United States v.

In <i>Casas,</i> we held that the testimony of a government agent that the defendants were members of a drug conspiracy was inadmissible hearsay. <i>Id.</i> at 117-18. Defendant's argument must be rejected, however, because here the statement was not offered to prove that a conspiracy existed, but only to explain why the agent's notes had omitted certain information. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 801(c)(stating that hearsay is \"a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted\"). In <i>Casas,</i> the testimony was given by the case agent to prove that the conspiracy existed. <i>Id.</i> at 118 (stating that the agent testified as to the existence of the drug trafficking organization, that all four defendants were members and that the organization handled cocaine and heroin). It was found to be reversible error to admit the testimonial statement in that case because it sought to establish the existence of the conspiracy, <i>i.e.,</i> the ultimate issue in the case, before the jury had made that determination. Here, as the statement was not offered for its truth, it is not hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also argues that the statement regarding the safety valve hearing was improper hearsay testimony. Where, as here, a statement is introduced to impeach a statement that a witness provided on direct examination, the statement is admissible for that purpose. The government argues that the evidence is admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 613(b), which provides for the admissibility of extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness as long as the witness is afforded an opportunity to explain or deny his statement. <i>See United States v.

Reference to murder conviction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that the prosecution made a gratuitous reference to Soto's murder conviction by saying that he was serving time for murder when defendant visited him at Las Cucharas and that the prosecutor argued guilt by association. \"A defendant is entitled to have the question of his guilt determined by the evidence against him, not on whether a co-defendant or government witness has been convicted of the same charge.\" <i>United States v. Dworken,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510631\"><a href=\"/opinion/510631/united-states-v-jay-lewis-dworken-aka-jason-lewis-jay-lewis-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first day of trial, the government and defendant informed the judge that they had reached an agreement not to mention most or any murders that involved witnesses. Soto was convicted of first degree murder and released on probation before the conspiracy at issue here began. The government's theory of the case involved the defendant's visits to Soto's house, in particular where he went with a government witness during Soto's probation. Defendant concedes that this association was relevant to the conspiracy, but argues that there was no need to mention the conviction and the only reason that the prosecutor did so was so the jury would be more likely to convict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that evidence of the murder conviction was already entered into the record through the testimony of several witnesses. <i>See United States v. McKeeve,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197677\"><a href=\"/opinion/197677/united-states-v-mckeeve/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1997)(holding that a prosecutor may accurately describe the testimony the jury already heard through witness testimony in the closing). The record reveals that the comment defendant identifies referred to his continued assistance of Soto even after his murder conviction. There was nothing improper in stating a fact that had already been entered into the record, particularly since the comment did not implicate defendant in any murder. The charge of conspiracy was, in context, related to defendant's role as Soto's second in command for a certain period of time, which included the time Soto was on probation, under house arrest for first degree murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, at the beginning of the trial, counsel agreed that while certain murders would not be mentioned to the jury, there were some murders incidental to the conspiracy which would be entered into evidence. Because there was a specific agreement between the parties, we are convinced this could not rise to any error on the part of the district court. <i>See Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 126 (where defendant specifically agreed to let the court inform the jury about a plea agreement&#8212;which contained mention of murders&#8212;objections are waived).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Improper Appeal to Jury's Passion And Prejudice</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that the cumulative effect of the closing was to inflame the jury's passions to deprive him of a fair trial. Defendant argues that the closing, as excerpted below, incited the jury to find him guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]here's going to be argument, oh, they were really bad people, they would rob, all they did was sell drugs, and they would consume drugs. But when you hear that argument, ask yourself, people like Borrero, who was he selling drugs for? [Defendant]. People who are smarter than him. People who have better opportunities than people like [Borrero] that just grew up at the Ceiba Housing Project, that never had an education, never had an opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And you think about Alexander Figueroa. Oh, he's a convicted murderer. And yes, he is, and he's a despicable human being, a person that had no pity for people like Jeannette, the 19-year-old girl that he carjacked. When you examine his testimony, I invite you, ladies and gentlemen, to consider what has Alex Figueroa done all his life? Since he was 12 years old, all he did was consume narcotics, `meterse drogas' as they say, and rob. And rob for what? To get more money, to get more drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And who was [sic] the drugs he was selling for? [Defendant]. I submit to you when you consider credibility, you say Alexander Figueroa is real bad, we agree he is real bad. But who was he doing that for? For people like [defendant], that you heard evidence, even from [defense] witnesses, that had better opportunities in life. That's who he was selling drugs for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These statements are of the species of commentary that may inflame the jury's passion. Not only was the issue of drug trafficking addressed as social malaise, but it seemed to introduce an element of social standing into the closing&#8212;that defendant was more guilty than the others because he had had the opportunity to do something with his life, but instead chose drug trafficking. We cannot say, however, that \"[t]hese comments interjected issues having no bearing on the defendant's guilt or innocence and improperly appealed to the jury to act in ways other than as dispassionate arbiters of the facts.\" <i>United States v.

We cannot say these closing remarks would have affected the trial's outcome. The comments were brief, isolated, and repetitive of witnesses' own testimony during the government's case in chief. <i>Mooney,</i> 315 F.3d at 60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also argues that the prosecution, in closing, improperly referred to defendant's testimony, intimating it was untruthful. The prosecutor stated \"[w]ho has the most interest in the outcome of this case? [Defendant], who takes the stand and tells you, ladies and gentlemen, that [Soto's] dad asked him to go visit him in jail so he can talk to him.\" However, on this issue, as above, the government argues that the defense had put every witnesses's credibility at issue. Under such circumstances, this type of reference cannot fairly be construed as an inappropriate reference to defendant's credibility. <i>See P&#233;rez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d at 9-10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defendant argues that, given the prosecution's behavior during the trial, he was denied a fair trial. We have held that \"individual errors insufficient of themselves to necessitate a new trial may in the aggregate have a more debilitating effect.\" <i>United States v. Sep&#250;lveda,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1195-96 (1st Cir.1993). Defendant argues that this was such a case because: there was sufficient reason to disbelieve the government's witnesses given their strong incentives to testify against defendant; witnesses' testimony had factual errors; they were all housed in the same federal prison; and the prosecution had no physical evidence against defendant. Since we believe no errors were committed in the course of the trial, defendant's argument regarding due process fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the jury verdict, the defendant's case was transferred to a sentencing judge who reviewed the trial transcript and imposed a sentence based on the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"USSG\"). The sentencing judge accepted the pre-sentence report's (\"PSR\") drug quantity recommendation of five to fifteen kilograms, and imposed a three-level enhancement under USSG &#167; 3B1.1(b) for the defendant's role in the offense and a two-level enhancement under USSG &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1) for weapon possession. The resulting sentencing range was 210 to 262 months. The applicable range was reduced to 210 to 240 months because of the twenty-year statutory maximum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C).

Nevertheless, the Supreme Court drew a distinction in <i>Booker</i> between those cases in which the sentencing court erred only in applying mandatory Guidelines, and those with an underlying constitutional violation, in which the mandatory Guidelines sentence was based in part on facts not admitted by the defendant or found by a jury. 125 S.Ct. at 769 (vacating both defendants' sentences while recognizing that Booker's sentence violated the Sixth Amendment but Fanfan's, which was based solely on the facts found by the jury, did not). The Court instructed that we \"must apply [<i>Booker's</i> ] holdings&#8212;both the Sixth Amendment holding and our remedial interpretation of the Sentencing Act&#8212;to all cases on direct review.\" <i>Id.</i> Nevertheless, the Supreme Court did not anticipate that all <i>Booker</i> errors would require remand and resentencing, in part \"because, in cases not involving a Sixth Amendment violation, whether resentencing is warranted or whether it will instead be sufficient to review a sentence for reasonableness may depend upon application of the harmless-error doctrine.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant seizes on this sentence, arguing that it implies that cases that <i>do</i> involve a Sixth Amendment violation must be automatically remanded, without harmless error review. We agree that the defendant's sentence involved a Sixth Amendment violation within the meaning of <i>Booker:</i> neither the drug quantity, the defendant's role in the offense, nor his responsibility for the possession of a firearm by a co-conspirator were admitted by the defendant or found by the jury. Nevertheless, we disagree that harmless error review is inapplicable to such cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language the defendant relies upon from <i>Booker</i> anticipates the outcome of harmless error review in cases challenging only the mandatory application of the Guidelines, but it does not preclude harmless error review of cases involving an underlying Sixth Amendment violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The Supreme Court has made clear that not all errors of constitutional dimension require automatic reversal. <i>Chapman v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span> (1967). As we explained in <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> it is not certain that a sentence would always be different under the advisory regime. 399 F.3d at 80. Indeed, sometimes the opposite may be clear, as when a sentencing judge has explicitly stated that he would impose the same sentence even if he had discretion to depart from the Guidelines. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Carpenter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201505\"><a href=\"/opinion/201505/united-states-v-carpenter/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.2005) (finding no plain error where sentencing judge stated that, even if he had discretion depart from a Guidelines sentence, he would not do so). Moreover, even when it involves an underlying Sixth Amendment violation, <i>Booker</i> error is not structural in nature. <i>Id.</i> at 80 n. 11. Thus, preserved <i>Booker</i> error does not require an automatic remand, but must be reviewed for harmlessness. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) (error not affecting substantial rights shall be disregarded).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The burden of proving that the preserved <i>Booker</i> error did not affect the defendant's substantial rights lies with the government. <i>See Chapman,</i> 386 U.S. at 24, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107359\"><a href=\"/opinion/107359/chapman-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This conclusion would be incorrect in the instant case, where a mandatory Guidelines sentence was imposed on the basis of judge-found facts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Mandatory application of the Guidelines in such a case violates the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. <i>See Booker</i> 125 S.Ct. at 756.

That is, we must be convinced that a lower sentence would not have been imposed had the Guidelines been advisory. This is an extremely difficult, but not impossible, standard to meet. While the government, in light of the difficulty of meeting its burden, has on occasion conceded to remand for <i>Booker</i> error, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Mercado Irizarry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789904\"><a href=\"/opinion/789904/united-states-v-felix-mercado-irizarry-manuel-vazquez-mendez-eliezer/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span>, 499 (1st Cir.2005), it has not done so here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Harmless error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the sentencing judge's belief that the Guidelines were mandatory did not contribute to the defendant's sentence, but it has failed to meet its heavy burden of proving this claim beyond a reasonable doubt. In support of its position, the government refers to statements made by the sentencing judge that suggest he was convinced of the factual basis for the enhancements he applied. But even if, as the government further alleges, each factor were supported by overwhelming evidence, factual certainty alone would not be sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the judge, acting under an advisory Guidelines system, would have applied the same sentence on the basis of those factors. In the instant case, the government has pointed to no statement or action of the sentencing judge that would assure us that he would have imposed the same sentence in the absence of mandatory Guidelines. To the contrary, our doubt on this point is enhanced by the fact that, while the applicable Guidelines constrained the sentencing judge to the upper margin of sentences available under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C), the sentence he chose was at the low end of that margin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the government suggests that we may find the <i>Booker</i> error harmless if we determine that the resulting sentence is reasonable. <i>See Booker,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 767 (\"The district courts, while not bound by the Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing. The courts of appeals review sentencing decisions for unreasonableness.\") (internal citation omitted). This argument is without merit. The reasonableness standard is to be used in reviewing sentences imposed in compliance with <i>Booker. See id.</i> at 769 (suggesting that if <i>Booker</i> error is harmless in cases not involving Sixth Amendment violation, resulting sentence may only require reasonableness review). The defendant's sentence did not comply with <i>Booker.</i> Even if we determined that a 210 month sentence was reasonable based on the facts considered at sentencing, we could not rule out the possibility that, under advisory Guidelines, the sentencing judge would have imposed a lower reasonable sentence. Thus, we hold that the government has failed to meet its burden of showing that the <i>Booker</i> error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Remedy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two distinct options are available to remedy preserved <i>Booker</i> error that has not been proven harmless. We can vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing, or we can follow the lead of the Second Circuit and remand for a determination of whether the sentencing judge would have applied a different sentence under an advisory Guidelines regime. <i>See Crosby,</i> 397 F.3d at 116-18. Although the Second Circuit deemed a <i>Crosby</i> remand \"appropriate in order to undertake a proper application of the plain error and harmless error doctrines,\" <i>id.</i> at 117, it has only been applied in unpreserved error cases, and appears to have been directed largely at avoiding construing doubt about prejudice in the context of plain error review against defendants, <i>see United States v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789374\"><a href=\"/opinion/789374/united-states-v-bernard-b-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span>, 457-61 (2d Cir.2005).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Nevertheless, theless, the <i>Crosby</i> remand does have the added benefits of avoiding the need to convene a resentencing hearing &#8212; a much more administratively taxing event than a sentencing judge's reevaluation on a <i>Crosby</i> remand &#8212; in cases where the sentencing judge determines that the same sentence would have been imposed under advisory Guidelines. <i>Id.</i> at 459. It also avoids, again in cases where the sentence would not have changed, the quandary of whether aggravating or mitigating facts that have arisen since the original sentencing can be considered. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these advantages, we decline to engage in this sort of limited remand for preserved <i>Booker</i> error when the government has failed to prove harmlessness. We do not anticipate that there will be so many such cases that reconvening sentencing hearings will create a significant administrative burden. And, while the problem of newly arisen sentencing factors is significant, it will have to be addressed if a sentencing court determines that a different sentence would have been imposed under advisory Guidelines. Thus, we cannot be certain of avoiding the problem with <i>Crosby</i> remands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the limited benefit of <i>Crosby</i> remands in the context of preserved error, we prefer to follow a more traditional route. Although this is a case of first impression, roughly analogous precedent exists in those cases where we have found that the sentencing judge mistakenly believed that he was without authority to depart from a Guidelines sentence. <i>See United States v. Delgado-Reyes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199337\"><a href=\"/opinion/199337/united-states-v-delgado-reyes/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Mariano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"598971\"><a href=\"/opinion/598971/united-states-v-abel-a-mariano-jr-united-states-of-america-v-barry/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1150</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1993). In both cases, despite the possibility that the judge might have opted not to depart, we vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing. <i>See Delgado-Reyes,</i> 245 F.3d at 23-24 (remanding because sentencing judge \"seemed inclined\" to accept joint stipulation that lower range applied); <i>Mariano,</i> 983 F.2d at 1150 (remanding where we were \"unable confidently to say... that the judge's error was harmless\"). We will do the same here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we remand for resentencing under <i>Booker,</i> we will not consider the defendant's remaining claim that the facts found by the sentencing judge are insufficient to support the enhancements applied. The new sentence will, however, be subject to reasonableness review should it be challenged in the future. <i>Booker,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 765.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the defendant's conviction, but vacate his sentence.

A reviewing court cannot determine that the same verdict would have been rendered had the proper instruction been given, without itself violating the constitutional guarantee of a jury trial. <i>Id.</i> at 279, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112868\"><a href=\"/opinion/112868/sullivan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It may well be possible to determine, on the basis of the judge's articulated rationale, whether the same sentence would have been imposed under an advisory Guidelines regime.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> As the Second Circuit explained in<i>United States v.

It did not, however, apply that procedure to remedy a finding that a preserved <i>Booker</i> error was not harmless, opting instead to vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing. <i>See United States v.
