We have therefore substituted Attorney\nGeneral Gonzales for John Ashcroft as the respondent. See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 25(d)(1); Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f               Per Curiam.         Poltak Hutauruk, a native of Indonesia,\n\npetitions for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\")\n\ndecision summarily affirming an immigration judge’s (\"IJ’s\") denial\n\nof his request for asylum.               We deny the petition.\n\n               On July 13, 2001, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService issued to Hutauruk a Notice to Appear, alleging that he was\n\nan alien removable for staying beyond the term of his visitor’s\n\nvisa.1      See 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B).               Hutauruk admitted that he\n\nwas removable but sought asylum on the ground that he had been\n\npersecuted because of his religion.2\n\n               Hutauruk      is    a    Pentecostal      Christian          and    a native\n\nIndonesian.          His wife and son still live in Indonesia.                     Hutauruk\n\ntestified       that    on   May       14,    1998,    there    were       riots    in   the\n\nneighborhood where he worked, an ethnically Chinese area.                            During\n\nthese       riots,    Hutauruk     was       injured   and     had    to    seek    medical\n\nattention.       He testified that the rioters were screaming Muslim\n\nreligious       slogans      and   that       their    actions       were    directed     at\n\nChristians.      After the riots, Hutauruk got a new job and stayed in\n\nIndonesia until September 23, 2000, when he traveled to the United\n\n\n     1\n      The relevant functions of the INS were transferred to the\nDepartment of Homeland Security and reorganized into the Bureau of\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement in March 2003. Because the\nrelevant events took place prior to the reorganization, we refer to\nthe INS.\n        2\n      Hutauruk also applied for withholding of removal and\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture, but does not\nchallenge the denials of those applications in his petition.\n\n                                              -2-\n\fStates.   Hutauruk did not report any other incidents during the 28\n\nmonths that he remained in Indonesia.\n\n              Hutauruk also testified that his family has experienced\n\nreligious violence since he came to the United States.                   He stated\n\nthat on December 24, 2000, while his wife, son, and mother-in-law\n\nwere attending Christmas services, the church they were in was\n\nbombed.   Though his child was not hurt, Hutauruk’s wife was hit in\n\nthe head with glass, and his mother-in-law injured her knee.\n\n              After a hearing before an IJ, Hutauruk’s request for\n\nasylum was denied.      The IJ determined that Hutauruk did not prove\n\neither that he had endured persecution or that he had a reasonable\n\nfear of future persecution.            Regarding past persecution, the IJ\n\nconcluded that Hutauruk’s religion was not a cause of his injuries\n\nbecause the rioting on May 14, 1998 was general rioting and the\n\nrioters   had    no   way    of    knowing       that   Hutauruk   was   Christian.\n\nConcerning Hutauruk’s claim that he will be persecuted if he\n\nreturns to Indonesia, the IJ determined that the attacks against\n\nChristians were not invidious enough to amount to persecution and\n\nthat the government of Indonesia had not condoned the actions of\n\nthe “extremists.”       The BIA summarily affirmed.\n\n              When the BIA summarily affirms an IJ’s ruling, we review\n\nthe IJ’s decision directly.            Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373\n\n(1st   Cir.    2003).       We    review    the    IJ’s   conclusions    under   the\n\n“deferential ‘substantial evidence’ standard,”                Carcamo-Recinos v.\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fAshcroft, 389 F.3d 252, 256 (1st Cir. 2004), which requires us to\n\nuphold the IJ’s decision “if supported by reasonable, substantial,\n\nand probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.”\n\nKhalil v. Ashcroft, 337 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2003)(internal\n\nquotation mark omitted). Under this standard, a petitioner must do\n\nmore than simply identify alternative findings supported by the\n\nevidence.   See Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 372 (1st Cir. 2003);\n\nsee also INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 482 (1992); Aguilar-\n\nSolis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir, 1999). Rather, the\n\npetitioner must show that the evidence is so overwhelming that a\n\nreasonable factfinder would have to conclude that he is entitled to\n\nasylum.   Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 482.\n\n            Hutauruk’s petition, which challenges only the finding as\n\nto likely future persecution, relies entirely on a 2002 State\n\nDepartment report on human rights practices in Indonesia submitted\n\nby the government in the administrative proceedings.3             Hutauruk\n\nreads the    report   to   establish   conclusively   that   he   would   be\n\npersecuted were he to return to Indonesia.      But the report does not\n\ncompel such a conclusion. Though the report describes instances of\n\nreligious violence in Indonesia and governmental ineffectiveness in\n\nresponding to these incidents, it also states that the government\n\n     3\n      The INS contends that Hutauruk’s argument regarding the\nreport is not properly before us because he did not base his BIA\nappeal upon it.     Because the outcome of this proceeding is\nforeordained under circuit precedent regardless, we shall treat\nHutauruk’s contention, arguendo, as properly raised on appeal.\nSee Sousa v. INS, 226 F.3d 28, 32 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                                   -4-\n\fwas working with a non-governmental organization to investigate the\n\nDecember 24 bombings, and that there is no evidence “that security\n\nforces, as an institution, supported either side.”       The report\n\nfurther states that Indonesia’s religious freedom provisions are\n\n“generally respect[ed],” and that perpetrators of some of the\n\nDecember 24 bombings were convicted and given prison sentences.\n\nFinally, and in any event, the report does not indicate that\n\nreligious persecution is so pervasive in Indonesia that Hutauruk\n\ncould not avoid it by relocating within the country.    See 8 C.F.R.\n\n208.13(2)(C)(ii).\n\n          We have no basis to disturb the denial of Hutauruk’s\n\nasylum application.    Accordingly, we deny his petition for review.\n\n          So Ordered\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
