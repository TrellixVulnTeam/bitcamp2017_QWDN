George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                Howard, Selya and Ebel,* Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     David D. Dowd, with whom Curley & Curley, P.C., Jeffrey T.\nEdwards, and Preti, Flaherty, Beliveau & Pachios, LLP were on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Thomas C. Newman, with whom Nicole L. Bradick and Murray,\nPlumb & Murray were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            August 5, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.       Class actions, by their very\n\nnature, can alter the usual dynamics of litigation and bring to\n\nbear on defendants and insurers alike intense pressure to settle.\n\nSee, e.g., Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray, 208 F.3d 288, 293\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (discussing situations in which \"the grant of class\n\nstatus raises the stakes of the litigation so substantially that\n\nthe defendant likely will feel irresistible pressure to settle\").\n\nFaced with such a situation, defendant-appellant American National\n\nFire Insurance Company (ANFIC) attempted to have its cake and eat\n\nit too: it joined in an advantageous settlement of a potentially\n\ncostly class action and then attempted to recoup from its own\n\ninsured (York County, Maine) the lion's share of the payment that\n\nit had made.\n\n           The district court ruled that ANFIC was not entitled to\n\nreimbursement.    See Am. Nat'l Fire Ins. Co. v. York County (D. Ct.\n\nOp.), 582 F. Supp. 2d 69, 81 (D. Me. 2008).     Discerning no error,\n\nwe affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           We assume the reader's familiarity with the district\n\ncourt's exegetic account of the underlying facts, see id. at 70-77.\n\nThus, we rehearse here only those particulars that are helpful to\n\nplace the appeal itself into a workable perspective.    Because the\n\nappealed decision follows a bench trial and there is no clear error\n\nin the district court's factfinding, we state the facts as found\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fand draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most\n\nfavorable to the judgment.\n\n            We bifurcate our survey, first discussing the class\n\naction and then moving to the instant case.\n\n                        A.   The Class Action.\n\n            In October of 2002, three persons who had been strip-\n\nsearched at the York County Jail following misdemeanor arrests\n\nfiled suit against the County.     The suit was filed as a putative\n\nclass action on behalf of the named plaintiffs and others similarly\n\nsituated.    See Nilsen v. York County, 219 F.R.D. 19, 20 (D. Me.\n\n2003).   It sought damages on account of an alleged pattern and\n\npractice of illegally strip-searching arrestees.\n\n            During what would become the class period — October 14,\n\n1996 through April 30, 2004 — York County had in force a series of\n\nlaw enforcement liability (LEL) insurance policies underwritten by\n\nTwin Cities Insurers Company, ANFIC, and Maine County Commissioners\n\nAssociation Risk Pool, respectively.\n\n            Each insurer had covered York County for a portion of the\n\nclass period: Twin Cities covered the County for a span that\n\nincluded the first sixteen days; ANFIC's coverage ran from November\n\n1, 1996 through January 1, 1998; and the Risk Pool afforded\n\ncoverage from the expiration of ANFIC's policy to a date past the\n\nend of the class period.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f           When the putative class action was filed, the Risk Pool\n\nwas the insurer of record. Consequently, it assumed the defense on\n\nYork County's behalf and retained Peter Marchesi as defense counsel\n\nfor the County.   It also retained Jim Poliquin as separate counsel\n\nto represent its own interests. York County retained Gene Libby to\n\nrepresent its (uninsured) interests.\n\n           The district court certified the class in 2003.              On an\n\ninterlocutory appeal, we upheld the certification. Tardiff v. Knox\n\nCounty, 365 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004).             While that appeal was\n\npending, the County notified its other insurers, each of which\n\nultimately agreed to participate in a coordinated defense of the\n\nnow-certified class action.\n\n           As noted above, ANFIC's LEL coverage was in effect for a\n\nfourteen-month    interval   (all   of    which   fell   within   the   class\n\nperiod).   As a member of the coordinated defense group, ANFIC\n\nagreed to pay twenty-five percent of the collaborative defense\n\ncosts.\n\n           The declarations page of ANFIC's policy made its coverage\n\nsubject to both a $5,000 per claim deductible and an aggregate per-\n\noccurrence limit of $1,000,000.           Defense costs under the policy\n\nwere supplementary; they were, therefore, neither set off against\n\nliability limits nor capped in any amount.\n\n           ANFIC commenced its participation in the joint defense\n\nafter issuing a reservation-of-rights letter on January 22, 2004.\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fIn that letter, a company hierarch, William Curtin, unilaterally\n\ndeclared that \"the $5,000 deductible will apply to each claim\n\nbrought for illegal strip search within the coverage period.\"\n\nANFIC never explicitly withdrew this reservation of rights.\n\n             As a prelude to a planned mediation of the class action,\n\nmembers of the defense group (including representatives from York\n\nCounty, Twin Cities, ANFIC, and the Risk Pool) held a private\n\nmeeting.       At   this   session,   Marchesi     stated   the   obvious:   a\n\nsettlement was desirable from everyone's point of view because the\n\ndefense was faced with a sizable class, liability was a near-\n\ncertainty, and total damages would likely be sky-high.               Marchesi\n\npredicted that the award would far exceed the face value of all\n\navailable insurance and that, in the bargain, there would be \"very\n\nsignificant\" litigation costs.1         Libby explained that, aside from\n\navailable     insurance,    York    County   had   less   than    $100,000   to\n\ncontribute to any settlement fund.\n\n             The first mediation session took place on September 20,\n\n2004.     At that session, Marchesi acted as the principal negotiator\n\nfor   the    defense   group,   but    all   members   of   the   group   were\n\nindividually represented.          Curtin restated ANFIC's position that\n\nits coverage was subject to a $5,000 per claim deductible.             He also\n\n\n      1\n       Around the same time, the attorney for the class estimated\nthat the class had over 8,000 members. If the case were tried, the\nattorney envisioned a damage award in the neighborhood of\n$22,000,000, plus ancillary items (counsel fees, expenses, and\ncosts) totaling over $11,000,000.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fmaintained that ANFIC's contribution to any settlement should be\n\nlimited to no more than fifteen percent of the total fund.                         The\n\nparties did not reach a settlement, but the defense group achieved\n\na consensus favoring settlement \"within the existing insurance and\n\nrisk pool coverage.\"\n\n             Following this mediation session, Libby wrote to Curtin,\n\nacknowledging ANFIC's position vis-à-vis the policy deductible but\n\nexplaining     that      York   County   viewed     the    $5,000     deductible    as\n\napplying     \"to   the    entire   class      and   not   [to]   individual     class\n\nmembers.\" Regardless of how the deductible operated, Libby warned,\n\nit was likely that a verdict would exhaust the entire $1,000,000 in\n\ncoverage afforded by the ANFIC policy.                On that basis, Libby asked\n\nthat   the    entire      $1,000,000     be    made    available      \"to    conclude\n\nnegotiations with plaintiffs.\"\n\n             ANFIC, through Dowd, \"respectfully but unequivocally\n\nrejected\"     York    County's     interpretation         of   how   the   deductible\n\noperated.     It did not comment as to Libby's prediction about what\n\nwould happen if the case went to trial.\n\n             On September 29, 2004, the parties attended a second\n\nmediation session.         By the end of the session, each member of the\n\ndefense group had agreed to up the ante.                  Specifically, the Risk\n\nPool had authorized $1,850,000 toward a global settlement; Twin\n\nCities had authorized $10,000; York County had authorized $25,000\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fin County funds; and ANFIC had authorized $650,000.2                        When agreeing\n\nto   contribute            $650,000        toward      settlement,    Curtin        did     not\n\ncommunicate any restrictions on the contribution, nor did he\n\nmention          that   ANFIC       intended    to     seek   recoupment    based      on   the\n\npolicy's deductible provision.\n\n                  In late October, Dowd sent another letter to Libby\n\nadmonishing that ANFIC would be liable only \"for loss in excess of\n\n$5,000 [on] each claim.\"                   In reply, Libby reiterated that ANFIC's\n\npotential          exposure         exceeded     $1,000,000       regardless      of      which\n\ninterpretation           of     the    deductible        provision   prevailed.           In   a\n\nseparate letter, Marchesi made a similar observation and exhorted\n\nANFIC       to    loosen      the     purse    strings     and   increase   its     proposed\n\ncontribution to the global settlement.\n\n                  Following         this      exchange     of    correspondence,          Libby\n\nscheduled a conference call with Dowd and Marchesi.                               This call\n\nlasted for almost an hour.                    The protagonists discussed at length\n\nANFIC's appropriate share of a global settlement.                              The policy\n\ndeductible was not mentioned.\n\n                  Shortly thereafter, Curtin received approval from ANFIC's\n\nclaims committee to make a $750,000 contribution.                              The claims\n\ncommittee neither imposed any conditions on that authority nor\n\nstipulated that such an offer could be extended only if payment was\n\n\n\n        2\n       These contributions were agreed to within the defense group\nbut not offered at that time to class counsel.\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fmade subject to the policy deductible.          Dowd then called Marchesi\n\nand hiked ANFIC's proposed contribution to $750,000, provided that\n\nall other members of the defense group contributed the amounts\n\npreviously authorized.\n\n           With ANFIC's contribution in hand, Marchesi was able to\n\nsettle the class action by agreeing to establish a $3,300,000\n\nsettlement fund.         The defense group funded the settlement as\n\nfollows:   the    Risk    Pool   contributed    $2,400,000,    Twin   Cities\n\ncontributed $100,000, York County contributed $50,000, and ANFIC\n\ncontributed $750,000.        The settlement extinguished all claims\n\n(whether   or    not   previously   asserted)    by   arrestees   who   were\n\nunlawfully strip-searched at the York County Jail during the class\n\nperiod.    An express condition of the settlement was that counsel\n\nfor York County \"provide an affidavit and/or testimony regarding\n\nthe relative lack of assets available to fund a settlement that\n\n[exceeded $3,300,000].\" The parties secured court approval for the\n\nsettlement, releases were expected, a judgment was entered, and the\n\nmatter appeared to have been concluded.\n\n           Ultimately, the district court designated 1,410 claimants\n\nto receive payments from the settlement fund.                 Each approved\n\nclaimant received a payment of $1,719.08.         Of these claimants, 273\n\nwere strip-searched during the currency of ANFIC's policy. None of\n\nthese 273 claimants received more than $5,000.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f                       B.    The Recoupment Action.\n\n          After the class action was put to bed, ANFIC invoked\n\ndiversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1), and sued York\n\nCounty in Maine's federal district court. It sought to recover the\n\n$750,000 it had contributed to the class settlement on the ground\n\nthat the funds represented deductibles owed to it by York County.\n\nANFIC posited that because each and every individual claim was\n\nsettled for less than the $5,000 deductible amount, its settlement\n\ncontribution was composed entirely of deductibles (advanced by it\n\non behalf of its insured (York County)).           York County denied the\n\nthrust of the complaint and asserted various affirmative defenses\n\n(including equitable estoppel and accord and satisfaction), see\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(c).\n\n          In    due   season,    the   parties   cross-moved   for    partial\n\nsummary judgment concerning the meaning of the policy's \"per claim\"\n\ndeductible language.        The district court accepted ANFIC's reading\n\nof the provision.     It ruled, in effect, that \"per claim\" means \"per\n\nclaimant,\" not \"per class.\"            Am. Nat'l. Fire Ins. Co. v. York\n\nCounty, No. 06-200, 2007 WL 4531720, at *1 (D. Me. Dec. 18, 2007).\n\nThat ruling has not been challenged on appeal.\n\n          The    battleground       then     shifted   to   York     County's\n\naffirmative defenses.         After a bench trial, the district court\n\nfound, in the alternative, that an accord and satisfaction had\n\noccurred, D. Ct. Op., 582 F. Supp. 2d at 77; and that, in all\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fevents, ANFIC was equitably estopped from pursuing its claim for\n\nreimbursement of deductibles, id.         This timely appeal followed.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           In this venue, ANFIC challenges each of the district\n\ncourt's alternative holdings.       Where, as here, a district court\n\nmakes alternative holdings, each independently sufficient to ground\n\nits decision, a reviewing court must sustain the judgment as long\n\nas either holding is viable.       See United States v. Barletta, 652\n\nF.2d 218, 220 (1st Cir. 1981).      Because we agree with the district\n\ncourt that equitable estoppel bans any recovery by ANFIC on the\n\nclaim asserted, we do not reach the question of whether the parties\n\nachieved an accord and satisfaction.\n\n           We    review   a   district    court's   legal   determinations\n\nfollowing a bench trial de novo.     United States v. 15 Bosworth St.,\n\n236 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 2001).           We regard a district court's\n\nfindings of fact more deferentially; we accept such findings unless\n\nthey are clearly erroneous.        Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6); Wine &\n\nSpirits Retailers, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 481 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n2007). Put another way, the trier's factual determinations will be\n\nset aside only if, \"after careful evaluation of the evidence, we\n\nare left with an abiding conviction that those determinations and\n\nfindings are simply wrong.\" State Police Ass'n v. Comm'r, 125 F.3d\n\n1, 5 (1st Cir. 1997).     This respectful standard takes into account\n\nthat the trial court \"sees and hears the witnesses at first hand\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fand comes to appreciate the nuances of the litigation in a way\n\nwhich appellate courts cannot hope to replicate.\"               Cumpiano v.\n\nBanco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n            The standard of review is important here.            At several\n\njunctures, more than one plausible inference can be drawn from the\n\nraw facts.   In each instance here, we are duty-bound to honor the\n\ntrial judge's choice of which inference to draw.         See Anderson v.\n\nCity of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985); see also United\n\nStates v. Ladd, 885 F.2d 954, 957 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"Where, as in\n\nthis case, a trier chooses among plausible (albeit competing)\n\ninferences, appellate courts should not intrude.\").\n\n            In this diversity case, the substantive law of Maine\n\ncontrols.    See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 (1938).\n\nUnder Maine law, an insured who seeks to invoke equitable estoppel\n\nagainst   his   insurer   in    a   coverage   dispute   must    prove   (i)\n\nunreasonable conduct that misleads the insured concerning the scope\n\nof coverage; and (ii) justifiable and detrimental reliance by the\n\ninsured on that conduct.       See County Forest Prods., Inc. v. Green\n\nMt. Agency, Inc., 758 A.2d 59, 66 (Me. 2000); Me. Mut. Fire Ins.\n\nCo. v. Grant, 674 A.2d 503, 504 (Me. 1996).        The reliance element\n\nordinarily requires that the insurer's unreasonable conduct incite\n\nthe insured \"to do what resulted to his detriment and what he would\n\nnot otherwise have done.\"      Roberts v. Me. Bonding & Cas. Co., 404\n\nA.2d 238, 241 (Me. 1979).           Because equitable estoppel is an\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\faffirmative defense, the insured bears the burden of proving both\n\nthe \"misleading conduct\" and the \"detrimental reliance\" elements.\n\nMe. Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 674 A.2d at 504.\n\n            With this framework in place, we return to the case at\n\nhand.    The district court found that ANFIC's conduct in settling\n\nthe class action belied any intention to preserve its rights under\n\nthe deductible provision.        See D. Ct. Op., 582 F. Supp. 2d at 80-\n\n81.     That conduct \"misled the County\" by inducing \"a reasonable\n\nbelief    that   ANFIC    was   waiving    its   reserved    rights    to   seek\n\nreimbursement of any deductible when it contributed $750,000 to the\n\n[global] settlement of the York County Jail class action.\"               Id. at\n\n77.   The County acted on that belief, to its detriment.              Id. at 81.\n\nAs we explain below, these findings are not clearly erroneous.\n\n            We start with the \"conduct\" question — whether ANFIC\n\nacted unreasonably and thereby misled York County.             There are two\n\nways to look at this question.        ANFIC says that it always intended\n\nto recoup the deductibles.         Viewing ANFIC's conduct in that light,\n\nthe   district    court    found    that     \"what   makes   ANFIC's    conduct\n\nunreasonable is . . . its failure to disclose that [its $750,000\n\ncontribution to the global settlement] was not the contribution it\n\nappeared to be.\"     Id. at 80.\n\n            There is another way to look at ANFIC's conduct.                The\n\ndistrict court found that ANFIC's decision to pursue its deductible\n\ninterest was a post hoc brain-storm, conceived only after the\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fglobal settlement had been achieved.            See id. at 81 (\"ANFIC's\n\ndecision to seek deductible reimbursement from York County was a\n\nstrategy developed ex post facto.\").\n\n             In the end, however, ANFIC's intent is not the issue. On\n\nthe one hand, if ANFIC intended all along to recoup the deductibles\n\nyet failed to mention that fact at the appropriate time, it should\n\nhave known that York County would reasonably perceive its silence\n\nas an abandonment of the \"deductible\" claim and consider ANFIC's\n\n$750,000 as an unconditional contribution from ANFIC's own coffers\n\n(not merely a pass-through payment).          On the other hand, if ANFIC\n\nmade an about-face after the settlement and conceived the plan to\n\nrecoup the deductibles at that late date, the County's belief, at\n\nthe   time    of   the   settlement,   that    ANFIC   had    abandoned   the\n\n\"deductible\" claim would be equally reasonable.              Either way, the\n\ndistrict court's finding of unreasonable conduct is inexpugnable.\n\n             ANFIC defends its position by arguing that it never\n\nformally withdrew its reservation of rights. But actions sometimes\n\nspeak louder than words and this is such an instance.\n\n             ANFIC also argues that, whichever scenario might apply,\n\nit never portrayed its contribution was anything other than a loss\n\npayment.     In its view, simply paying what it was obligated to pay\n\nunder the policy cannot plausibly be deemed unreasonable.                 This\n\nplatitude begs the question; that the payment was made with respect\n\nto covered losses and obligated expenses sheds very little light on\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fwhat York County reasonably perceived ANFIC's agreement to be when\n\nit entered into the global settlement.\n\n                  If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that ANFIC's conduct was unreasonable\n\nis reinforced by other facts touching upon the negotiations.                      For\n\nexample, there was no attempt during the settlement pavane to reach\n\nan understanding between ANFIC and York County as to how parties'\n\ncontributions would interact.                By the same token, ANFIC made no\n\neffort to secure an agreement as to how its contribution would be\n\nallocated.3             Moreover,   when    ANFIC    transmitted    its   draft   for\n\n$750,000, it imposed no conditions or reservations on negotiation\n\nof the draft.            At no time prior to filing the instant action did\n\nANFIC attempt to characterize its contribution as an advance of\n\ndeductibles or suggest that the payment was anything other than an\n\noutright contribution toward the global settlement. Last — but far\n\nfrom least — ANFIC was well aware of both York County's financial\n\nplight and the County's representation that the global settlement\n\nwould exhaust its available funds (and, hence, leave nothing to\n\nfall       back    on    if   an   effort   was    subsequently    made   to   recoup\n\ndeductibles).\n\n\n\n\n       3\n       This is especially noteworthy because, in prior settlements\nin which unresolved coverage disputes lingered, Curtin made a\npractice of assuring that there was express agreement to table the\ncoverage dispute and resolve it after the settlement was completed.\n\n                                            -14-\n\f             This brings us to the second element of the equitable\n\nestoppel defense: justifiable detrimental reliance.                    The district\n\ncourt found that, had the County known that ANFIC intended to seek\n\nrecoupment of its $750,000 contribution, the County would not have\n\nagreed to the global settlement.             See D. Ct. Op., 582 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 81.     The district court also found that the County's reliance\n\nwas justifiable and detrimental.             Id.\n\n             While    ANFIC      challenges       the   reasonableness      of   York\n\nCounty's belief that the global settlement would extinguish the\n\nCounty's    liability       to   all   concerned,       the   chain   of   events   is\n\ntelling.     ANFIC agreed to its contribution only after a long,\n\ncomplicated negotiation among the members of the defense group. It\n\nis transparently clear that each participant was striving to limit\n\nits own exposure to potentially massive damages and substantial\n\nlitigation costs.\n\n             ANFIC's $1,000,000 liability coverage was plainly at\n\nrisk; the dispute about the deductibles bore only marginally on\n\nthat risk.    Indeed, in urging ANFIC to make a hefty contribution to\n\nthe settlement fund, the County specifically noted that even if\n\nANFIC was right about how the deductible provision operated,\n\nawarded damages should exhaust its $1,000,000 policy limit and, in\n\nthe bargain, produce huge defense costs (of which ANFIC had agreed\n\nto pay twenty-five percent).             Under these circumstances, ANFIC's\n\nagreement     to     make     the      $750,000     contribution      without       any\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fcontemporaneous mention of the policy deductible or any renewal of\n\nits   reservation   of     rights   was    unreasonably     deceptive.      That\n\nconduct, in turn, led the County to believe, quite reasonably, that\n\nany issue anent the deductible had been swallowed up in the global\n\nsettlement.\n\n           ANFIC    also    denigrates      the   finding    that   the   County\n\nsuffered a detriment, asserting that even if a fully informed York\n\nCounty might have acted differently, it suffered no detriment by\n\nentering   into    the   settlement       agreement   because    the   County's\n\nalternative was worse.       This is sophistic reasoning.\n\n           ANFIC's blithe assertion assumes that, had York County\n\nnot acquiesced in the global settlement and agreed to contribute\n\n$50,000, the necessary alternative was a full-dress trial resulting\n\nin a multi-million-dollar verdict against York County (far in\n\nexcess of its available insurance coverage).                That is incorrect.\n\nThe County's non-acquiescence might well have prompted the other\n\nmembers of the defense group to rethink the matter and, perhaps,\n\nincrease their contributions to the common fund (thus allowing the\n\nsettlement to be consummated); or the County's non-acquiescence\n\nmight have prompted the class representatives to lower their sights\n\nand accept a lesser amount in settlement.             Even if the settlement\n\ncratered and the class action went to trial, the County might have\n\nhad a viable claim against ANFIC for a bad-faith refusal to settle.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fSee, e.g., Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24-A, § 2436-A; Wilson v. Aetna\n\nCas. & Sur. Co., 76 A.2d 111, 113 (Me. 1950).\n\n            The lesson is that where, as here, a party reasonably\n\nbelieves that it is wrapping up its entire exposure and settling a\n\ncase for a sum certain, it suffers a detriment whenever it is\n\nrequired to pay more to fund the settlement.      That lesson applies\n\nhere: the County reasonably believed that its $50,000 contribution\n\nto the settlement fund would absolve it of all liability but, on\n\nANFIC's recasting of the scenario, it will be expected to make\n\nadditional payments that might aggregate as much as $750,000.\n\nAccordingly, we agree with the lower court that there was a\n\ndetriment: the County did something that substantially altered its\n\nlegal rights and that it would not otherwise have done.     No more is\n\nexigible.    See Roberts, 404 A.2d at 241.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            To recapitulate, the district court supportably found\n\nthat, under the circumstances, ANFIC's course of conduct was\n\nunreasonable and misleading; that York County reasonably bought\n\ninto the impression that ANFIC had created; and that the County,\n\nthrough     that    reliance,   suffered   a   cognizable   detriment.\n\nConsequently, the finding of equitable estoppel is bulletproof.\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe reject ANFIC's appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -18-\n\f",

Bradick and Murray, Plumb &amp; Murray were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before HOWARD, SELYA and EBEL,<sup>[*]</sup> Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Class actions, by their very nature, can alter the usual dynamics of litigation and bring to bear on defendants and insurers alike intense pressure to settle. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d 288, 293 (1st Cir.2000) (discussing situations in which \"the grant of class status raises the stakes of the litigation so substantially that the defendant likely will feel irresistible pressure to settle\"). Faced with such a situation, defendant-appellant American National Fire Insurance Company (ANFIC) attempted to have its cake and eat it too: it joined in an advantageous settlement of a potentially costly class action and then attempted to recoup from its own insured (York County, Maine) the lion's share of the payment that it had made.</p>\n<p>The district court ruled that ANFIC was not entitled to reimbursement. <i>See </i><i>Am. Nat'l Fire Ins. Co. v. York County (D.Ct.Op.),</i> 582 F.Supp.2d 69, 81 (D.Me. 2008). Discerning no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We assume the reader's familiarity with the district court's exegetic account of the underlying facts, <i>see id.</i> at 70-77. Thus, we rehearse here only those particulars that are helpful to place the appeal itself into a workable perspective. Because the appealed decision follows a bench trial and there is no clear error in the district court's factfinding, we state the facts as found and draw all reasonable inferences <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> therefrom in the light most favorable to the judgment.</p>\n<p>We bifurcate our survey, first discussing the class action and then moving to the instant case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Class Action.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In October of 2002, three persons who had been strip-searched at the York County Jail following misdemeanor arrests filed suit against the County. The suit was filed as a putative class action on behalf of the named plaintiffs and others similarly situated. <i>See </i><i>Nilsen v. York County,</i> 219 F.R.D. 19, 20 (D.Me.2003). It sought damages on account of an alleged pattern and practice of illegally strip-searching arrestees.</p>\n<p>During what would become the class periodOctober 14, 1996 through April 30, 2004York County had in force a series of law enforcement liability (LEL) insurance policies underwritten by Twin Cities Insurers Company, ANFIC, and Maine County Commissioners Association Risk Pool, respectively.</p>\n<p>Each insurer had covered York County for a portion of the class period: Twin Cities covered the County for a span that included the first sixteen days; ANFIC's coverage ran from November 1, 1996 through January 1, 1998; and the Risk Pool afforded coverage from the expiration of ANFIC's policy to a date past the end of the class period.</p>\n<p>When the putative class action was filed, the Risk Pool was the insurer of record. Consequently, it assumed the defense on York County's behalf and retained Peter Marchesi as defense counsel for the County. It also retained Jim Poliquin as separate counsel to represent its own interests. York County retained Gene Libby to represent its (uninsured) interests.</p>\n<p>The district court certified the class in 2003. On an interlocutory appeal, we upheld the certification. <i>Tardiff v. Knox County,</i> 365 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2004). While that appeal was pending, the County notified its other insurers, each of which ultimately agreed to participate in a coordinated defense of the now-certified class action.</p>\n<p>As noted above, ANFIC's LEL coverage was in effect for a fourteen-month interval (all of which fell within the class period). As a member of the coordinated defense group, ANFIC agreed to pay twenty-five percent of the collaborative defense costs.</p>\n<p>The declarations page of ANFIC's policy made its coverage subject to both a $5,000 per claim deductible and an aggregate per-occurrence limit of $1,000,000. Defense costs under the policy were supplementary; they were, therefore, neither set off against liability limits nor capped in any amount.</p>\n<p>ANFIC commenced its participation in the joint defense after issuing a reservation-of-rights letter on January 22, 2004. In that letter, a company hierarch, William Curtin, unilaterally declared that \"the $5,000 deductible will apply to each claim brought for illegal strip search within the coverage period.\" ANFIC never explicitly withdrew this reservation of rights.</p>\n<p>As a prelude to a planned mediation of the class action, members of the defense group (including representatives from York County, Twin Cities, ANFIC, and the Risk Pool) held a private meeting. At this session, Marchesi stated the obvious: a settlement was desirable from everyone's point of view because the defense was faced with a sizable class, liability was a near-certainty, and total damages would likely be sky-high. Marchesi predicted that the award would far exceed the face value of all available insurance and that, in the bargain, there would be \"very significant\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*116</span> litigation costs.<sup>[1]</sup> Libby explained that, aside from available insurance, York County had less than $100,000 to contribute to any settlement fund.</p>\n<p>The first mediation session took place on September 20, 2004. At that session, Marchesi acted as the principal negotiator for the defense group, but all members of the group were individually represented. Curtin restated ANFIC's position that its coverage was subject to a $5,000 per claim deductible. He also maintained that ANFIC's contribution to any settlement should be limited to no more than fifteen percent of the total fund. The parties did not reach a settlement, but the defense group achieved a consensus favoring settlement \"within the existing insurance and risk pool coverage.\"</p>\n<p>Following this mediation session, Libby wrote to Curtin, acknowledging ANFIC's position vis-à-vis the policy deductible but explaining that York County viewed the $5,000 deductible as applying \"to the entire class and not [to] individual class members.\" Regardless of how the deductible operated, Libby warned, it was likely that a verdict would exhaust the entire $1,000,000 in coverage afforded by the ANFIC policy. On that basis, Libby asked that the entire $1,000,000 be made available \"to conclude negotiations with plaintiffs.\"</p>\n<p>ANFIC, through Dowd, \"respectfully but unequivocally rejected\" York County's interpretation of how the deductible operated. It did not comment as to Libby's prediction about what would happen if the case went to trial.</p>\n<p>On September 29, 2004, the parties attended a second mediation session. By the end of the session, each member of the defense group had agreed to up the ante. Specifically, the Risk Pool had authorized $1,850,000 toward a global settlement; Twin Cities had authorized $10,000; York County had authorized $25,000 in County funds; and ANFIC had authorized $650,000.<sup>[2]</sup> When agreeing to contribute $650,000 toward settlement, Curtin did not communicate any restrictions on the contribution, nor did he mention that ANFIC intended to seek recoupment based on the policy's deductible provision.</p>\n<p>In late October, Dowd sent another letter to Libby admonishing that ANFIC would be liable only \"for loss in excess of $5,000 [on] each claim.\" In reply, Libby reiterated that ANFIC's potential exposure exceeded $1,000,000 regardless of which interpretation of the deductible provision prevailed. In a separate letter, Marchesi made a similar observation and exhorted ANFIC to loosen the purse strings and increase its proposed contribution to the global settlement.</p>\n<p>Following this exchange of correspondence, Libby scheduled a conference call with Dowd and Marchesi. This call lasted for almost an hour. The protagonists discussed at length ANFIC's appropriate share of a global settlement. The policy deductible was not mentioned.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, Curtin received approval from ANFIC's claims committee to make a $750,000 contribution. The claims committee neither imposed any conditions on that authority nor stipulated that such <span class=\"star-pagination\">*117</span> an offer could be extended only if payment was made subject to the policy deductible. Dowd then called Marchesi and hiked ANFIC's proposed contribution to $750,000, provided that all other members of the defense group contributed the amounts previously authorized.</p>\n<p>With ANFIC's contribution in hand, Marchesi was able to settle the class action by agreeing to establish a $3,300,000 settlement fund. The defense group funded the settlement as follows: the Risk Pool contributed $2,400,000, Twin Cities contributed $100,000, York County contributed $50,000, and ANFIC contributed $750,000. The settlement extinguished all claims (whether or not previously asserted) by arrestees who were unlawfully strip-searched at the York County Jail during the class period. An express condition of the settlement was that counsel for York County \"provide an affidavit and/or testimony regarding the relative lack of assets available to fund a settlement that [exceeded $3,300,000].\" The parties secured court approval for the settlement, releases were expected, a judgment was entered, and the matter appeared to have been concluded.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the district court designated 1,410 claimants to receive payments from the settlement fund. Each approved claimant received a payment of $1,719.08. Of these claimants, 273 were strip-searched during the currency of ANFIC's policy. None of these 273 claimants received more than $5,000.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Recoupment Action.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>After the class action was put to bed, ANFIC invoked diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1), and sued York County in Maine's federal district court. It sought to recover the $750,000 it had contributed to the class settlement on the ground that the funds represented deductibles owed to it by York County. ANFIC posited that because each and every individual claim was settled for less than the $5,000 deductible amount, its settlement contribution was composed entirely of deductibles (advanced by it on behalf of its insured (York County)). York County denied the thrust of the complaint and asserted various affirmative defenses (including equitable estoppel and accord and satisfaction), <i>see</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(c).</p>\n<p>In due season, the parties cross-moved for partial summary judgment concerning the meaning of the policy's \"per claim\" deductible language. The district court accepted ANFIC's reading of the provision. It ruled, in effect, that \"per claim\" means \"per claimant,\" not \"per class.\" <i>Am. Nat'l. Fire Ins. Co. v. York County,</i> No. 06-200, 2007 WL 4531720, at *1 (D.Me. Dec. 18, 2007). That ruling has not been challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p>The battleground then shifted to York County's affirmative defenses. After a bench trial, the district court found, in the alternative, that an accord and satisfaction had occurred, <i>D.Ct.Op.,</i> 582 F.Supp.2d at 77; and that, in all events, ANFIC was equitably estopped from pursuing its claim for reimbursement of deductibles, <i>id.</i> This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>In this venue, ANFIC challenges each of the district court's alternative holdings. Where, as here, a district court makes alternative holdings, each independently sufficient to ground its decision, a reviewing court must sustain the judgment as long as either holding is viable. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Barletta,</i> 652 F.2d 218, 220 (1st Cir.1981). Because we agree with the district court that equitable estoppel bans any recovery by ANFIC on the claim asserted, we do not reach the question of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*118</span> whether the parties achieved an accord and satisfaction.</p>\n<p>We review a district court's legal determinations following a bench trial de novo. <i>United States v. 15 Bosworth St.,</i> 236 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir.2001). We regard a district court's findings of fact more deferentially; we accept such findings unless they are clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)(6); <i>Wine &amp; Spirits Retailers, Inc. v. Rhode Island,</i> 481 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2007). Put another way, the trier's factual determinations will be set aside only if, \"after careful evaluation of the evidence, we are left with an abiding conviction that those determinations and findings are simply wrong.\" <i>State Police Ass'n v. Comm'r,</i> 125 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1997). This respectful standard takes into account that the trial court \"sees and hears the witnesses at first hand and comes to appreciate the nuances of the litigation in a way which appellate courts cannot hope to replicate.\" <i>Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R.,</i> 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>The standard of review is important here. At several junctures, more than one plausible inference can be drawn from the raw facts. In each instance here, we are duty-bound to honor the trial judge's choice of which inference to draw. <i>See </i><i>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City,</i> 470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Ladd,</i> 885 F.2d 954, 957 (1st Cir.1989) (\"Where, as in this case, a trier chooses among plausible (albeit competing) inferences, appellate courts should not intrude.\").</p>\n<p>In this diversity case, the substantive law of Maine controls. <i>See </i><i>Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins,</i> 304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). Under Maine law, an insured who seeks to invoke equitable estoppel against his insurer in a coverage dispute must prove (i) unreasonable conduct that misleads the insured concerning the scope of coverage; and (ii) justifiable and detrimental reliance by the insured on that conduct. <i>See </i><i>County Forest Prods., Inc. v. Green Mt. Agency, Inc.,</i> 758 A.2d 59, 66 (Me.2000); <i>Me. Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Grant,</i> 674 A.2d 503, 504 (Me. 1996). The reliance element ordinarily requires that the insurer's unreasonable conduct incite the insured \"to do what resulted to his detriment and what he would not otherwise have done.\" <i>Roberts v. Me. Bonding &amp; Cas. Co.,</i> 404 A.2d 238, 241 (Me.1979). Because equitable estoppel is an affirmative defense, the insured bears the burden of proving both the \"misleading conduct\" and the \"detrimental reliance\" elements. <i>Me. Mut. Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 674 A.2d at 504.</p>\n<p>With this framework in place, we return to the case at hand. The district court found that ANFIC's conduct in settling the class action belied any intention to preserve its rights under the deductible provision. <i>See D.Ct.Op.,</i> 582 F.Supp.2d at 80-81. That conduct \"misled the County\" by inducing \"a reasonable belief that ANFIC was waiving its reserved rights to seek reimbursement of any deductible when it contributed $750,000 to the [global] settlement of the York County Jail class action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 77. The County acted on that belief, to its detriment. <i>Id.</i> at 81. As we explain below, these findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p>We start with the \"conduct\" questionwhether ANFIC acted unreasonably and thereby misled York County. There are two ways to look at this question. ANFIC says that it <i>always</i> intended to recoup the deductibles. Viewing ANFIC's conduct in that light, the district court found that \"what makes ANFIC's conduct unreasonable is ... its failure to disclose that [its $750,000 contribution to the global <span class=\"star-pagination\">*119</span> settlement] was not the contribution it appeared to be.\" <i>Id.</i> at 80.</p>\n<p>There is another way to look at ANFIC's conduct. The district court found that ANFIC's decision to pursue its deductible interest was a post hoc brain-storm, conceived only after the global settlement had been achieved. <i>See id.</i> at 81 (\"ANFIC's decision to seek deductible reimbursement from York County was a strategy developed ex post facto.\").</p>\n<p>In the end, however, ANFIC's intent is not the issue. On the one hand, if ANFIC intended all along to recoup the deductibles yet failed to mention that fact at the appropriate time, it should have known that York County would reasonably perceive its silence as an abandonment of the \"deductible\" claim and consider ANFIC's $750,000 as an unconditional contribution from ANFIC's own coffers (not merely a pass-through payment). On the other hand, if ANFIC made an about-face after the settlement and conceived the plan to recoup the deductibles at that late date, the County's belief, <i>at the time of the settlement,</i> that ANFIC had abandoned the \"deductible\" claim would be equally reasonable. Either way, the district court's finding of unreasonable conduct is inexpugnable.</p>\n<p>ANFIC defends its position by arguing that it never formally withdrew its reservation of rights. But actions sometimes speak louder than words and this is such an instance.</p>\n<p>ANFIC also argues that, whichever scenario might apply, it never portrayed its contribution was anything other than a loss payment. In its view, simply paying what it was obligated to pay under the policy cannot plausibly be deemed unreasonable. This platitude begs the question; that the payment was made with respect to covered losses and obligated expenses sheds very little light on what York County reasonably perceived ANFIC's agreement to be when it entered into the global settlement.</p>\n<p>If more were neededand we doubt that it isthe district court's conclusion that ANFIC's conduct was unreasonable is reinforced by other facts touching upon the negotiations. For example, there was no attempt during the settlement pavane to reach an understanding between ANFIC and York County as to how parties' contributions would interact. By the same token, ANFIC made no effort to secure an agreement as to how its contribution would be allocated.<sup>[3]</sup> Moreover, when ANFIC transmitted its draft for $750,000, it imposed no conditions or reservations on negotiation of the draft. At no time prior to filing the instant action did ANFIC attempt to characterize its contribution as an advance of deductibles or suggest that the payment was anything other than an outright contribution toward the global settlement. Lastbut far from leastANFIC was well aware of both York County's financial plight and the County's representation that the global settlement would exhaust its available funds (and, hence, leave nothing to fall back on if an effort was subsequently made to recoup deductibles).</p>\n<p>This brings us to the second element of the equitable estoppel defense: justifiable detrimental reliance. The district court found that, had the County known that ANFIC intended to seek recoupment of its $750,000 contribution, the County would not have agreed to the global settlement. <i>See D.Ct.Op.,</i> 582 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*120</span> F.Supp.2d at 81. The district court also found that the County's reliance was justifiable and detrimental. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>While ANFIC challenges the reasonableness of York County's belief that the global settlement would extinguish the County's liability to all concerned, the chain of events is telling. ANFIC agreed to its contribution only after a long, complicated negotiation among the members of the defense group. It is transparently clear that each participant was striving to limit its own exposure to potentially massive damages and substantial litigation costs.</p>\n<p>ANFIC's $1,000,000 liability coverage was plainly at risk; the dispute about the deductibles bore only marginally on that risk. Indeed, in urging ANFIC to make a hefty contribution to the settlement fund, the County specifically noted that even if ANFIC was right about how the deductible provision operated, awarded damages should exhaust its $1,000,000 policy limit and, in the bargain, produce huge defense costs (of which ANFIC had agreed to pay twenty-five percent). Under these circumstances, ANFIC's agreement to make the $750,000 contribution without any contemporaneous mention of the policy deductible or any renewal of its reservation of rights was unreasonably deceptive. That conduct, in turn, led the County to believe, quite reasonably, that any issue anent the deductible had been swallowed up in the global settlement.</p>\n<p>ANFIC also denigrates the finding that the County suffered a detriment, asserting that even if a fully informed York County might have acted differently, it suffered no detriment by entering into the settlement agreement because the County's alternative was worse. This is sophistic reasoning.</p>\n<p>ANFIC's blithe assertion assumes that, had York County not acquiesced in the global settlement and agreed to contribute $50,000, the necessary alternative was a full-dress trial resulting in a multi-million-dollar verdict against York County (far in excess of its available insurance coverage). That is incorrect. The County's non-acquiescence might well have prompted the other members of the defense group to rethink the matter and, perhaps, increase their contributions to the common fund (thus allowing the settlement to be consummated); or the County's non-acquiescence might have prompted the class representatives to lower their sights and accept a lesser amount in settlement. Even if the settlement cratered and the class action went to trial, the County might have had a viable claim against ANFIC for a bad-faith refusal to settle. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 24-A, § 2436-A; <i>Wilson v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.,</i> 145 Me. 370, 76 A.2d 111, 113 (1950).</p>\n<p>The lesson is that where, as here, a party reasonably believes that it is wrapping up its entire exposure and settling a case for a sum certain, it suffers a detriment whenever it is required to pay more to fund the settlement. That lesson applies here: the County reasonably believed that its $50,000 contribution to the settlement fund would absolve it of all liability but, on ANFIC's recasting of the scenario, it will be expected to make additional payments that might aggregate as much as $750,000. Accordingly, we agree with the lower court that there was a detriment: the County did something that substantially altered its legal rights and that it would not otherwise have done. No more is exigible. <i>See </i><i>Roberts,</i> 404 A.2d at 241.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>To recapitulate, the district court supportably found that, under the circumstances, ANFIC's course of conduct was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*121</span> unreasonable and misleading; that York County reasonably bought into the impression that ANFIC had created; and that the County, through that reliance, suffered a cognizable detriment. Consequently, the finding of equitable estoppel is bulletproof.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we reject ANFIC's appeal.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Around the same time, the attorney for the class estimated that the class had over 8,000 members.

Mowbray,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></span>, 293 (1st Cir.2000) (discussing situations in which \"the grant of class status raises the stakes of the litigation so substantially that the defendant likely will feel irresistible pressure to settle\"). Faced with such a situation, defendant-appellant American National Fire Insurance Company (ANFIC) attempted to have its cake and eat it too: it joined in an advantageous settlement of a potentially costly class action and then attempted to recoup from its own insured (York County, Maine) the lion's share of the payment that it had made.</p>\n<p>The district court ruled that ANFIC was not entitled to reimbursement. <i>See </i><i>Am. Nat'l Fire Ins. Co. v.

BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We assume the reader's familiarity with the district court's exegetic account of the underlying facts, <i>see id.</i> at 70-77. Thus, we rehearse here only those particulars that are helpful to place the appeal itself into a workable perspective. Because the appealed decision follows a bench trial and there is no clear error in the district court's factfinding, we state the facts as found and draw all reasonable inferences <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> therefrom in the light most favorable to the judgment.</p>\n<p>We bifurcate our survey, first discussing the class action and then moving to the instant case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Class Action.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In October of 2002, three persons who had been strip-searched at the York County Jail following misdemeanor arrests filed suit against the County. The suit was filed as a putative class action on behalf of the named plaintiffs and others similarly situated. <i>See </i><i>Nilsen v. York County,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></span>, 20 (D.Me.2003). It sought damages on account of an alleged pattern and practice of illegally strip-searching arrestees.</p>\n<p>During what would become the class periodOctober 14, 1996 through April 30, 2004York County had in force a series of law enforcement liability (LEL) insurance policies underwritten by Twin Cities Insurers Company, ANFIC, and Maine County Commissioners Association Risk Pool, respectively.</p>\n<p>Each insurer had covered York County for a portion of the class period: Twin Cities covered the County for a span that included the first sixteen days; ANFIC's coverage ran from November 1, 1996 through January 1, 1998; and the Risk Pool afforded coverage from the expiration of ANFIC's policy to a date past the end of the class period.</p>\n<p>When the putative class action was filed, the Risk Pool was the insurer of record. Consequently, it assumed the defense on York County's behalf and retained Peter Marchesi as defense counsel for the County. It also retained Jim Poliquin as separate counsel to represent its own interests. York County retained Gene Libby to represent its (uninsured) interests.</p>\n<p>The district court certified the class in 2003. On an interlocutory appeal, we upheld the certification. <i>Tardiff v. Knox County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200960\"><a href=\"/opinion/200960/tardiff-v-knox-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2004). While that appeal was pending, the County notified its other insurers, each of which ultimately agreed to participate in a coordinated defense of the now-certified class action.</p>\n<p>As noted above, ANFIC's LEL coverage was in effect for a fourteen-month interval (all of which fell within the class period). As a member of the coordinated defense group, ANFIC agreed to pay twenty-five percent of the collaborative defense costs.</p>\n<p>The declarations page of ANFIC's policy made its coverage subject to both a $5,000 per claim deductible and an aggregate per-occurrence limit of $1,000,000. Defense costs under the policy were supplementary; they were, therefore, neither set off against liability limits nor capped in any amount.</p>\n<p>ANFIC commenced its participation in the joint defense after issuing a reservation-of-rights letter on January 22, 2004. In that letter, a company hierarch, William Curtin, unilaterally declared that \"the $5,000 deductible will apply to each claim brought for illegal strip search within the coverage period.\" ANFIC never explicitly withdrew this reservation of rights.</p>\n<p>As a prelude to a planned mediation of the class action, members of the defense group (including representatives from York County, Twin Cities, ANFIC, and the Risk Pool) held a private meeting. At this session, Marchesi stated the obvious: a settlement was desirable from everyone's point of view because the defense was faced with a sizable class, liability was a near-certainty, and total damages would likely be sky-high. Marchesi predicted that the award would far exceed the face value of all available insurance and that, in the bargain, there would be \"very significant\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*116</span> litigation costs.<sup>[1]</sup> Libby explained that, aside from available insurance, York County had less than $100,000 to contribute to any settlement fund.</p>\n<p>The first mediation session took place on September 20, 2004. At that session, Marchesi acted as the principal negotiator for the defense group, but all members of the group were individually represented. Curtin restated ANFIC's position that its coverage was subject to a $5,000 per claim deductible. He also maintained that ANFIC's contribution to any settlement should be limited to no more than fifteen percent of the total fund. The parties did not reach a settlement, but the defense group achieved a consensus favoring settlement \"within the existing insurance and risk pool coverage.\"</p>\n<p>Following this mediation session, Libby wrote to Curtin, acknowledging ANFIC's position vis-à-vis the policy deductible but explaining that York County viewed the $5,000 deductible as applying \"to the entire class and not [to] individual class members.\" Regardless of how the deductible operated, Libby warned, it was likely that a verdict would exhaust the entire $1,000,000 in coverage afforded by the ANFIC policy. On that basis, Libby asked that the entire $1,000,000 be made available \"to conclude negotiations with plaintiffs.\"</p>\n<p>ANFIC, through Dowd, \"respectfully but unequivocally rejected\" York County's interpretation of how the deductible operated. It did not comment as to Libby's prediction about what would happen if the case went to trial.</p>\n<p>On September 29, 2004, the parties attended a second mediation session. By the end of the session, each member of the defense group had agreed to up the ante. Specifically, the Risk Pool had authorized $1,850,000 toward a global settlement; Twin Cities had authorized $10,000; York County had authorized $25,000 in County funds; and ANFIC had authorized $650,000.<sup>[2]</sup> When agreeing to contribute $650,000 toward settlement, Curtin did not communicate any restrictions on the contribution, nor did he mention that ANFIC intended to seek recoupment based on the policy's deductible provision.</p>\n<p>In late October, Dowd sent another letter to Libby admonishing that ANFIC would be liable only \"for loss in excess of $5,000 [on] each claim.\" In reply, Libby reiterated that ANFIC's potential exposure exceeded $1,000,000 regardless of which interpretation of the deductible provision prevailed. In a separate letter, Marchesi made a similar observation and exhorted ANFIC to loosen the purse strings and increase its proposed contribution to the global settlement.</p>\n<p>Following this exchange of correspondence, Libby scheduled a conference call with Dowd and Marchesi. This call lasted for almost an hour. The protagonists discussed at length ANFIC's appropriate share of a global settlement. The policy deductible was not mentioned.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, Curtin received approval from ANFIC's claims committee to make a $750,000 contribution. The claims committee neither imposed any conditions on that authority nor stipulated that such <span class=\"star-pagination\">*117</span> an offer could be extended only if payment was made subject to the policy deductible. Dowd then called Marchesi and hiked ANFIC's proposed contribution to $750,000, provided that all other members of the defense group contributed the amounts previously authorized.</p>\n<p>With ANFIC's contribution in hand, Marchesi was able to settle the class action by agreeing to establish a $3,300,000 settlement fund. The defense group funded the settlement as follows: the Risk Pool contributed $2,400,000, Twin Cities contributed $100,000, York County contributed $50,000, and ANFIC contributed $750,000. The settlement extinguished all claims (whether or not previously asserted) by arrestees who were unlawfully strip-searched at the York County Jail during the class period. An express condition of the settlement was that counsel for York County \"provide an affidavit and/or testimony regarding the relative lack of assets available to fund a settlement that [exceeded $3,300,000].\" The parties secured court approval for the settlement, releases were expected, a judgment was entered, and the matter appeared to have been concluded.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the district court designated 1,410 claimants to receive payments from the settlement fund. Each approved claimant received a payment of $1,719.08. Of these claimants, 273 were strip-searched during the currency of ANFIC's policy. None of these 273 claimants received more than $5,000.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Recoupment Action.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>After the class action was put to bed, ANFIC invoked diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1), and sued York County in Maine's federal district court. It sought to recover the $750,000 it had contributed to the class settlement on the ground that the funds represented deductibles owed to it by York County. ANFIC posited that because each and every individual claim was settled for less than the $5,000 deductible amount, its settlement contribution was composed entirely of deductibles (advanced by it on behalf of its insured (York County)). York County denied the thrust of the complaint and asserted various affirmative defenses (including equitable estoppel and accord and satisfaction), <i>see</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(c).</p>\n<p>In due season, the parties cross-moved for partial summary judgment concerning the meaning of the policy's \"per claim\" deductible language. The district court accepted ANFIC's reading of the provision. It ruled, in effect, that \"per claim\" means \"per claimant,\" not \"per class.\" <i>Am. Nat'l. Fire Ins. Co. v. York County,</i> No. 06-200, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4531720</span></span>, at *1 (D.Me. Dec. 18, 2007). That ruling has not been challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p>The battleground then shifted to York County's affirmative defenses. After a bench trial, the district court found, in the alternative, that an accord and satisfaction had occurred, <i>D.Ct.Op.,</i> 582 F.Supp.2d at 77; and that, in all events, ANFIC was equitably estopped from pursuing its claim for reimbursement of deductibles, <i>id.</i> This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>In this venue, ANFIC challenges each of the district court's alternative holdings. Where, as here, a district court makes alternative holdings, each independently sufficient to ground its decision, a reviewing court must sustain the judgment as long as either holding is viable. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Barletta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"391830\"><a href=\"/opinion/391830/united-states-v-john-r-barletta/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 220 (1st Cir.1981). Because we agree with the district court that equitable estoppel bans any recovery by ANFIC on the claim asserted, we do not reach the question of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*118</span> whether the parties achieved an accord and satisfaction.</p>\n<p>We review a district court's legal determinations following a bench trial de novo. <i>United States v. 15 Bosworth St.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199222\"><a href=\"/opinion/199222/united-states-v-15-bosworth-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.2001). We regard a district court's findings of fact more deferentially; we accept such findings unless they are clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)(6); <i>Wine &amp; Spirits Retailers, Inc. v. Rhode Island,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202664\"><a href=\"/opinion/202664/wine-spirits-v-greer/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2007). Put another way, the trier's factual determinations will be set aside only if, \"after careful evaluation of the evidence, we are left with an abiding conviction that those determinations and findings are simply wrong.\" <i>State Police Ass'n v. Comm'r,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746421\"><a href=\"/opinion/746421/state-police-association-of-massachusetts-v-commissioner-of-internal/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1997). This respectful standard takes into account that the trial court \"sees and hears the witnesses at first hand and comes to appreciate the nuances of the litigation in a way which appellate courts cannot hope to replicate.\" <i>Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540783\"><a href=\"/opinion/540783/wilma-cumpiano-aka-wilma-cumpiano-sanchez-v-banco-santander-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 152 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>The standard of review is important here. At several junctures, more than one plausible inference can be drawn from the raw facts. In each instance here, we are duty-bound to honor the trial judge's choice of which inference to draw. <i>See </i><i>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 573, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Co. v. Tompkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103012\"><a href=\"/opinion/103012/erie-r-co-v-tompkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 78, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1188</span></span> (1938). Under Maine law, an insured who seeks to invoke equitable estoppel against his insurer in a coverage dispute must prove (i) unreasonable conduct that misleads the insured concerning the scope of coverage; and (ii) justifiable and detrimental reliance by the insured on that conduct. <i>See </i><i>County Forest Prods., Inc. v. Green Mt. Agency, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></span>, 66 (Me.2000); <i>Me. Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Grant,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">674</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></span>, 504 (Me. 1996). The reliance element ordinarily requires that the insurer's unreasonable conduct incite the insured \"to do what resulted to his detriment and what he would not otherwise have done.\" <i>Roberts v. Me. Bonding &amp; Cas. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></span>, 241 (Me.1979). Because equitable estoppel is an affirmative defense, the insured bears the burden of proving both the \"misleading conduct\" and the \"detrimental reliance\" elements. <i>Me. Mut. Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 674 A.2d at 504.</p>\n<p>With this framework in place, we return to the case at hand. The district court found that ANFIC's conduct in settling the class action belied any intention to preserve its rights under the deductible provision. <i>See D.Ct.Op.,</i> 582 F.Supp.2d at 80-81. That conduct \"misled the County\" by inducing \"a reasonable belief that ANFIC was waiving its reserved rights to seek reimbursement of any deductible when it contributed $750,000 to the [global] settlement of the York County Jail class action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 77. The County acted on that belief, to its detriment. <i>Id.</i> at 81. As we explain below, these findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p>We start with the \"conduct\" questionwhether ANFIC acted unreasonably and thereby misled York County. There are two ways to look at this question. ANFIC says that it <i>always</i> intended to recoup the deductibles. Viewing ANFIC's conduct in that light, the district court found that \"what makes ANFIC's conduct unreasonable is ... its failure to disclose that [its $750,000 contribution to the global <span class=\"star-pagination\">*119</span> settlement] was not the contribution it appeared to be.\" <i>Id.</i> at 80.</p>\n<p>There is another way to look at ANFIC's conduct. The district court found that ANFIC's decision to pursue its deductible interest was a post hoc brain-storm, conceived only after the global settlement had been achieved. <i>See id.</i> at 81 (\"ANFIC's decision to seek deductible reimbursement from York County was a strategy developed ex post facto.\").</p>\n<p>In the end, however, ANFIC's intent is not the issue. On the one hand, if ANFIC intended all along to recoup the deductibles yet failed to mention that fact at the appropriate time, it should have known that York County would reasonably perceive its silence as an abandonment of the \"deductible\" claim and consider ANFIC's $750,000 as an unconditional contribution from ANFIC's own coffers (not merely a pass-through payment). On the other hand, if ANFIC made an about-face after the settlement and conceived the plan to recoup the deductibles at that late date, the County's belief, <i>at the time of the settlement,</i> that ANFIC had abandoned the \"deductible\" claim would be equally reasonable. Either way, the district court's finding of unreasonable conduct is inexpugnable.</p>\n<p>ANFIC defends its position by arguing that it never formally withdrew its reservation of rights. But actions sometimes speak louder than words and this is such an instance.</p>\n<p>ANFIC also argues that, whichever scenario might apply, it never portrayed its contribution was anything other than a loss payment. In its view, simply paying what it was obligated to pay under the policy cannot plausibly be deemed unreasonable. This platitude begs the question; that the payment was made with respect to covered losses and obligated expenses sheds very little light on what York County reasonably perceived ANFIC's agreement to be when it entered into the global settlement.</p>\n<p>If more were neededand we doubt that it isthe district court's conclusion that ANFIC's conduct was unreasonable is reinforced by other facts touching upon the negotiations. For example, there was no attempt during the settlement pavane to reach an understanding between ANFIC and York County as to how parties' contributions would interact. By the same token, ANFIC made no effort to secure an agreement as to how its contribution would be allocated.<sup>[3]</sup> Moreover, when ANFIC transmitted its draft for $750,000, it imposed no conditions or reservations on negotiation of the draft. At no time prior to filing the instant action did ANFIC attempt to characterize its contribution as an advance of deductibles or suggest that the payment was anything other than an outright contribution toward the global settlement. Lastbut far from leastANFIC was well aware of both York County's financial plight and the County's representation that the global settlement would exhaust its available funds (and, hence, leave nothing to fall back on if an effort was subsequently made to recoup deductibles).</p>\n<p>This brings us to the second element of the equitable estoppel defense: justifiable detrimental reliance. The district court found that, had the County known that ANFIC intended to seek recoupment of its $750,000 contribution, the County would not have agreed to the global settlement. <i>See D.Ct.Op.,</i> 582 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*120</span> F.Supp.2d at 81. The district court also found that the County's reliance was justifiable and detrimental. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>While ANFIC challenges the reasonableness of York County's belief that the global settlement would extinguish the County's liability to all concerned, the chain of events is telling. ANFIC agreed to its contribution only after a long, complicated negotiation among the members of the defense group. It is transparently clear that each participant was striving to limit its own exposure to potentially massive damages and substantial litigation costs.</p>\n<p>ANFIC's $1,000,000 liability coverage was plainly at risk; the dispute about the deductibles bore only marginally on that risk. Indeed, in urging ANFIC to make a hefty contribution to the settlement fund, the County specifically noted that even if ANFIC was right about how the deductible provision operated, awarded damages should exhaust its $1,000,000 policy limit and, in the bargain, produce huge defense costs (of which ANFIC had agreed to pay twenty-five percent). Under these circumstances, ANFIC's agreement to make the $750,000 contribution without any contemporaneous mention of the policy deductible or any renewal of its reservation of rights was unreasonably deceptive. That conduct, in turn, led the County to believe, quite reasonably, that any issue anent the deductible had been swallowed up in the global settlement.</p>\n<p>ANFIC also denigrates the finding that the County suffered a detriment, asserting that even if a fully informed York County might have acted differently, it suffered no detriment by entering into the settlement agreement because the County's alternative was worse. This is sophistic reasoning.</p>\n<p>ANFIC's blithe assertion assumes that, had York County not acquiesced in the global settlement and agreed to contribute $50,000, the necessary alternative was a full-dress trial resulting in a multi-million-dollar verdict against York County (far in excess of its available insurance coverage). That is incorrect. The County's non-acquiescence might well have prompted the other members of the defense group to rethink the matter and, perhaps, increase their contributions to the common fund (thus allowing the settlement to be consummated); or the County's non-acquiescence might have prompted the class representatives to lower their sights and accept a lesser amount in settlement. Even if the settlement cratered and the class action went to trial, the County might have had a viable claim against ANFIC for a bad-faith refusal to settle. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 24-A, § 2436-A; <i>Wilson v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Me.</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1932829\"><a href=\"/opinion/1932829/wilson-v-aetna-casualty-surety-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span>, 113 (1950).</p>\n<p>The lesson is that where, as here, a party reasonably believes that it is wrapping up its entire exposure and settling a case for a sum certain, it suffers a detriment whenever it is required to pay more to fund the settlement. That lesson applies here: the County reasonably believed that its $50,000 contribution to the settlement fund would absolve it of all liability but, on ANFIC's recasting of the scenario, it will be expected to make additional payments that might aggregate as much as $750,000. Accordingly, we agree with the lower court that there was a detriment: the County did something that substantially altered its legal rights and that it would not otherwise have done. No more is exigible. <i>See </i><i>Roberts,</i> 404 A.2d at 241.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>To recapitulate, the district court supportably found that, under the circumstances, ANFIC's course of conduct was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*121</span> unreasonable and misleading; that York County reasonably bought into the impression that ANFIC had created; and that the County, through that reliance, suffered a cognizable detriment. Consequently, the finding of equitable estoppel is bulletproof.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we reject ANFIC's appeal.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Around the same time, the attorney for the class estimated that the class had over 8,000 members. If the case were tried, the attorney envisioned a damage award in the neighborhood of $22,000,000, plus ancillary items (counsel fees, expenses, and costs) totaling over $11,000,000.</p>\n<p>[2]  These contributions were agreed to within the defense group but not offered at that time to class counsel.</p>\n<p>[3]  This is especially noteworthy because, in prior settlements in which unresolved coverage disputes lingered, Curtin made a practice of assuring that there was express agreement to table the coverage dispute and resolve it after the settlement was completed.</p>\n\n</div>",
