The Appellant, Elaina Malinowski, appeals\n\nfrom the district court's order granting summary judgment to\n\nAppellees, United Parcel Service, Inc. (\"UPS\") and Documented\n\nVehicle/Drivers Systems, Inc. (\"DVD\").           Ms. Malinowski argues that\n\nthe district court erred when it ruled that the Rhode Island\n\nSupreme    Court    would     not    recognize   an   independent     tort   for\n\nspoliation of evidence and that it further erred in concluding\n\nthat, even supposing it did recognize such a cause of action, she\n\nfailed to meet the essential elements.           We find it unnecessary to\n\nrule on the first ground and affirm on the second ground.\n\nI.          BACKGROUND\n\n            On     December    27,    1991,   fourteen   year   old    Michael\n\nMalinowski was struck and killed by a UPS tractor trailer operated\n\nby Stephen Hogan.        The accident occurred as Michael and three\n\nfriends were walking along Taunton Avenue in East Providence,\n\nengaged in horseplay, jumping and shoving each other.               As the UPS\n\ntruck approached the four boys, Michael was pushed by one of his\n\nfriends.    He lost his balance and fell into the road just as the\n\nUPS truck passed.\n\n            The accident was investigated by the State Police and by\n\nUPS.   After the State Police had completed their inspection of the\n\ntruck, a UPS supervisor, James Kershaw, removed a \"tachograph disc\"\n\nfrom the vehicle.      Such a disc, consisting of a round coated paper\n\nchart, tells the movement and speed of the vehicle as recorded on\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fa tachograph located in the cab of the truck.                        UPS sent the\n\ntachograph disc to DVD in California for an independent analysis.\n\nOn January 6, 1992, DVD issued a report and returned the disc to\n\nUPS.    The DVD report stated that the tachograph disc \"has not been\n\nproperly    cared    for,\"    but   that    the    information      was    readable.\n\nAccording to DVD, the tachograph disc indicated a speed of about 33\n\nmiles per hour at the time of the accident.                  But the report also\n\nnoted   a   number   of     discrepancies     in    the    data,    as    well   as   a\n\n\"mechanical error in the recording device,\" and concluded that the\n\ndisc was of \"very little value\" in determining Hogan's actual speed\n\nat the time of the accident.               Upon receipt of the report, UPS\n\nplaced the tachograph disc and the report in an Accident Folder.\n\n            Apart    from    obtaining     the     DVD    report,   UPS    performed\n\nindependent tests on the truck, specifically a veeder test.                           A\n\nveeder test uses a meter installed in the transmission to check the\n\naccuracy of the speedometer/odometer, by driving the vehicle a\n\nmeasured distance.        The veeder test indicated that the tachograph\n\nin the vehicle was inaccurate by 26 percent, which, according to\n\nUPS, meant that the tachograph was recording speeds 26 percent\n\nhigher than the actual speed of the vehicle.\n\n            On September 27, 1993, Ms. Malinowski, individually and\n\nas administratrix of the estate of Michael, brought a wrongful\n\ndeath action in the Rhode Island state court against Stephen Hogan\n\nand UPS.     Ms. Malinowski alleged that Hogan, who had conceded\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fseeing the boys at the side of the road, was negligent and was\n\ndriving too fast as he approached the boys.    At the start of the\n\ntrial, in May 1997, Ms. Malinowski obtained the tachograph disc and\n\nDVD report from UPS.    The disc was discolored but readable.   The\n\ntrial judge, with some hesitation, admitted the tachograph disc as\n\nan exhibit.    Neither party sought to introduce the DVD report.\n\nOver defense objections, the court allowed Ms. Malinowski's counsel\n\nto elicit testimony regarding the speed reading on the disc.\n\nKershaw, the UPS supervisor, testified that the disc showed a speed\n\nof 32-33 miles per hour at the time of the accident.     The speed\n\nreading was in direct contradiction to Hogan's testimony that he\n\nwas traveling approximately 20 miles per hour at the time of the\n\naccident.   Kershaw also testified that the tachograph disc showed\n\n\"continuous\" or \"progressive\" acceleration of the vehicle up to the\n\ntime of the accident.    This testimony also contradicted Hogan's\n\nreport that he honked and decelerated when he saw the boys and then\n\naccelerated when it appeared that they had stopped their horseplay.\n\nIn response, UPS's counsel had Kershaw testify to the veeder test,\n\nexplaining how the veeder test had established that the tachograph\n\nspeed readings were inaccurate.\n\n            On May 21, 1997, the jury returned a verdict for the\n\ndefendants.    The plaintiff appealed and, in May 1999, the Rhode\n\nIsland Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded based upon\n\nerrors in the jury instructions not relevant here.   See Malinowski\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fv. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 727 A.2d 194 (R.I. 1999).           Neither\n\nside appealed from the court's rulings admitting into evidence the\n\ntachograph disc and the veeder test, and the Rhode Island Supreme\n\nCourt's opinion does not mention these rulings.\n\n             In October 1999, the case was assigned for a second trial\n\nbefore a different judge.       At the second trial, UPS challenged the\n\nadmissibility     of   the   tachograph   disc.   UPS   argued   that   the\n\nplaintiff had not produced an expert to establish the accuracy of\n\nthe tachograph, and that the available evidence was that the\n\ntachograph was not accurate.         The trial judge heard testimony,\n\noutside the presence of the jury, regarding the accuracy of the\n\ntachograph.     Kershaw testified to the UPS records of repairs to\n\nHogan's vehicle, which showed that what he termed the speed gear\n\nhad been inaccurate for two months prior to the accident and that\n\nreplacement parts had been ordered but were not installed until\n\nafter the accident.      Hogan testified that he had been aware of a\n\nproblem with the speedometer in his vehicle before the accident.\n\nAs a result, the trial judge concluded that the speed readings from\n\nthe tachograph should be excluded.           The court ruled that the\n\nevidence provided by the tachograph was scientific evidence and\n\nthat the plaintiff had not established a foundation regarding the\n\naccuracy of that evidence as it related to the speed of the truck.1\n\n\n     1\n         Specifically, the court stated:\n\n     For the tachograph readings as to speed to be admissible,\n\n                                    -5-\n\fHowever, because neither party contested the accuracy of the\n\nreading regarding the deceleration and acceleration of the vehicle,\n\ntestimony regarding that reading was to be allowed.\n\n             Thus,   the   second   jury    was    not   allowed    to    hear   the\n\ntachograph readings giving the vehicle's purported speed. The jury\n\nin the second trial did, however, hear Kershaw testify that the\n\nline    on    the    tachograph     chart       indicated     \"continuous\"        or\n\n\"progressive\" acceleration as the vehicle approached the point of\n\nthe accident.\n\n             At the end of the second trial, Ms. Malinowski's counsel\n\nsubmitted a proposed jury instruction based on a Rhode Island\n\nevidentiary    rule    that   permits      an    adverse    inference     for    the\n\nunexplained,    deliberate     destruction        or   mutilation   of    relevant\n\nevidence.     See Rhode Island v. Barnes, 777 A.2d 140, 145 (R.I.\n\n2001)   (describing    the    \"doctrine     of    spoliation\").          The   court\n\ndeclined to give a jury charge on spoliation.               The court observed\n\nthat the tachograph was in evidence and that the plaintiff had\n\nfailed to identify \"what evidence was the subject of an argument\n\nregarding spoliation.\"        On October 8, 1999, the jury returned a\n\nverdict for the defense.\n\n\n\n       there must be evidence that the tachograph was in good\n       working order and accurate at the time the recording of\n       speed was made. Absent an appropriate foundation as to\n       the accuracy of the tachograph speed reading, the\n       evidence as to the speed cannot be deemed relevant\n       scientific evidence to be placed before the jury.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f              Ms.     Malinowski    filed    numerous   post-trial   motions,\n\nincluding motions seeking a new trial.           The motions for a new trial\n\nwere based upon two theories:         a contention that the court erred in\n\nexcluding the tachograph speed reading, and a claim of \"newly\n\ndiscovered\" evidence.        In support of these motions, Ms. Malinowski\n\nsubmitted unsworn reports from two people averring to be experts in\n\ntachograph analysis.        Both individuals commented on the discolored\n\nnature   of     the    tachograph    disc,    one   citing   its   \"deplorable\n\ncondition\" and the other his difficulty in reading it.                     Ms.\n\nMalinowski cited these comments as evidence that either UPS or DVD\n\nhad tampered with the disc.          However, both individuals went on to\n\nreport data they had obtained from the disc and they did not\n\nsuggest that the condition of the disc had prevented them from\n\nreading it.     Indeed, except for a ten and a half mile error on the\n\nspeed stylus, one expert expressly found no evidence of error, and\n\nneither of them noted any problem understanding and analyzing the\n\ndisc notwithstanding its poor condition.\n\n              Mr. Resmini, Ms. Malinowski's counsel, also submitted an\n\naffidavit in which he stated that he had just \"discovered\" that DVD\n\nwas still in existence.            Based on a comment by a UPS employee\n\nduring the first trial, Mr. Resmini had believed that DVD had gone\n\nout of business and, as a result, he had not sought to investigate\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fDVD's involvement.2     Mr. Resmini also averred that he had spoken by\n\nphone with the current owner of DVD, Mr. Wilson, and that Mr.\n\nWilson had informed him that the tachograph disc was in extremely\n\npoor condition.        Mr.    Wilson,    however,   declined     to   submit   an\n\naffidavit averring to the condition of the disc or offer an opinion\n\nregarding its accuracy.\n\n             The trial court denied each of the post-trial motions.\n\nThe court expressly rejected Ms. Malinowski's argument that any\n\nalleged mishandling of the tachograph disc by UPS had prevented\n\nMalinowski from laying the foundation for admissibility of the\n\nspeed reading.      With regard to the motion for new trial, the court\n\nfirst    observed   that     Mr.   Resmini's   affidavit   was    inadmissible\n\nhearsay.     Second, the court noted that even if deemed admissible,\n\nthe information in the affidavit could have been discovered prior\n\nto trial.3     Third, the court held that, even if considered new\n\n\n     2\n      Mr. Resmini suggests that UPS attempted to prevent Ms.\nMalinowski from contacting DVD by misrepresenting under oath that\nDVD was no longer in existence.     During the first trial, Mr.\nResmini asked a UPS employee whether DVD was still in existence.\nThe employee responded: \"No, they are not. I really can't answer\nthat. We did try to contact them but -- .\" The testimony at issue\nis not a definitive statement of whether DVD remained in business\nnor does it explain why Mr. Resmini waited until after the second\ntrial to obtain independent verification of DVD's existence.\n\n     3\n      On this point, the court seemed somewhat perplexed by the\nlack of effort on Ms. Malinowski's part to diligently develop the\nevidence necessary to support her claims. The court observed:\n\n     The absence of diligence on the expert front by plaintiff\n     is remarkable. There was an obvious lack of diligence\n\n                                        -8-\n\fevidence, the information probably would not have affected the\n\noutcome of trial.         The court concluded that \"[t]he evidence of\n\nactual speed is far less relevant than the evidence of acceleration\n\nor the other evidence of what actions Mr. Hogan did or did not take\n\n. . . .    I am not convinced that the introduction of evidence as to\n\nspeed would have altered the jury's verdict in this case . . . .\"4\n\n               Ms. Malinowski appealed, contending that the lower court\n\nerred     in   refusing   to   admit   the    tachograph   speed   reading   in\n\nevidence, in declining to charge the jury on spoliation, and in\n\ndenying the post-trial motions.              The Rhode Island Supreme Court\n\n\n\n     pertaining to the tachograph that predates even the first\n     trial.    There was no effort made by plaintiff [in\n     discovery] to request the tachograph or records bearing\n     on speed (which would have included the DVD report prior\n     to the first trial . . . .). When the plaintiff finally\n     learned about the tachograph and the defendant's expert\n     report by DVD during the first trial in 1997 (which was\n     six years post accident) no apparent effort was made from\n     that point until after the second trial in 1999 to have\n     the tachograph examined or to depose anyone at\n     DVD . . . .\n     4\n      The court had made a similar observation earlier in the\nhearing.\n\n     [E]ven assuming, arguendo, that the evidence as to speed,\n     as registered on the tachograph, should have been\n     admitted, this Court is not convinced that it would have\n     altered the result of this case. After all, the jury in\n     the first trial heard this evidence and reached the same\n     conclusion as the second jury, albeit with different jury\n     instructions . . . . More importantly, the more critical\n     evidence as to speed was not so much the actual speed of\n     the truck but the evidence of continued acceleration\n     (which this Court allowed).\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\faffirmed the rulings of the lower court, concluding that each of\n\nthe   rulings      was    an   appropriate     exercise       of   discretion.    See\n\nMalinowski v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.(Malinowski II), 792 A.2d 50\n\n(R.I. 2002).        The court opined that \"the jury heard the most\n\ncompelling information revealed by the tachograph -- that Hogan had\n\nfailed to decelerate upon seeing [the boys] . . . .\"                       Id. at 54.\n\nThe court further recognized that \"speed may not have been a factor\n\nin this accident because it is undisputed that Michael was struck\n\nby the rear wheels of the truck . . . .\"                Id.\n\n              Following the dismissal of her appeal in the wrongful\n\ndeath action, Ms. Malinowski brought this independent tort action\n\nin the Rhode Island state court claiming that the condition of the\n\ntachograph    disc       was   the   cause   of   her   inability     to     obtain   a\n\nfavorable jury verdict in the wrongful death action.                   According to\n\nMs. Malinowski, had the tachograph not been \"destroyed\" it would\n\nhave shown that Hogan was traveling at an excess speed at the time\n\nof the accident and that he failed to slow down when he observed\n\nthe boys in horseplay -- in direct contradiction to Hogan's own\n\ntestimony.      DVD and UPS removed the action to federal court.\n\n             DVD    and    UPS   immediately      filed   motions      for    summary\n\njudgment, arguing, inter alia, that Rhode Island did not recognize\n\na separate and independent tort for spoliation.                    Magistrate Judge\n\nLovegreen granted summary judgment to UPS and DVD.                   In a thorough\n\nreport and recommendation, he noted that the Rhode Island Supreme\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fCourt had     not   recognized   a   separate   and   independent   tort   of\n\nspoliation, and went on to hold that it was unlikely Rhode Island\n\nwould do so given the problems such a tort would create and the\n\nfact that a majority of \"the states' highest courts considering\n\nthis issue have declined to adopt a separate and independent cause\n\nof action for spoliation of evidence.\" Malinowski v. United Parcel\n\nServ., Inc., C.A. 01-273ML, report and recommendation, at 9 (D.R.I.\n\nMay 10, 2002).       The magistrate judge further held that even if\n\nRhode Island recognized such a tort, Ms. Malinowski had failed to\n\nadduce evidence that would establish its elements in her own case.\n\nId. at 20.    Hence, she had not shown that the disc's discoloration\n\nand poor condition were the cause of her inability to have obtained\n\na favorable jury verdict.        Id. at 21.     The magistrate judge noted\n\nthat although the independent experts that Ms. Malinowski had\n\nretained to review the tachograph disc after the second trial had\n\ncommented on its poor condition, they were still able to read and\n\nanalyze the contents of the disc.       The disc had not been destroyed,\n\nmutilated or significantly altered as would be required to make out\n\na spoliation tort.     Moreover, in the absence of evidence of why the\n\ndisc was in poor condition there was insufficient proof that\n\ndefendants had intended to damage the disc.\n\n             Ms. Malinowski objected to the report and recommendation\n\nof the magistrate judge.          The district court agreed with the\n\nmagistrate judge's conclusion that Rhode Island would not recognize\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fan independent tort for the spoliation of evidence.          Malinowski v.\n\nUnited Parcel Serv., Inc., No. 01-273ML, slip op. at 1 (D.R.I. June\n\n17, 2002).    The district court went on to conclude that even if the\n\ntort were available, the Rhode Island Supreme Court's decision in\n\nMalinowski II regarding the lack of materiality of the alleged\n\n\"newly discovered\" evidence of spoliation eliminated an essential\n\nelement of such a tort claim.           Id. at 2.      The district court\n\nentered judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants.\n\n             This appeal followed.\n\nII.          DISCUSSION\n\n             This court reviews grants of summary judgment de novo,\n\nconstruing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant\n\nand resolving all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.\n\nRochester Ford Sales, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 287 F.3d 32, 37 (1st\n\nCir. 2002). In opposing summary judgment, the nonmoving party \"may\n\nnot rest upon the mere allegations or denials of [the] pleading,\n\nbut must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine\n\nissue\" of material fact as to each issue upon which he or she would\n\nbear the ultimate burden of proof at trial.            Anderson v. Liberty\n\nLobby,   Inc.,   477   U.S.   242,   256    (1986)   (internal   quotations,\n\ncitation, and alteration omitted).           This standard of review does\n\nnot limit us to the district court's rationale; we may affirm the\n\nentry of summary judgment on \"any ground revealed by the record.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fHoulton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            Neither the Rhode Island legislature nor the Rhode Island\n\nSupreme Court has yet established or recognized the existence of an\n\nindependent tort for the spoliation of evidence.           While both the\n\nmagistrate judge and the district court judge concluded that the\n\nRhode Island Supreme Court would not create such a tort, we see no\n\nneed to delve into the unchartered waters of Rhode Island law and\n\nendeavor to prophesize whether the Rhode Island Supreme Court would\n\nadopt an independent tort for spoliation of evidence.              Compare,\n\ne.g., Fletcher v. Dorchester Mut. Ins. Co., 773 N.E.2d 420, 426\n\n(Mass. 2002) (declining to recognize an independent tort for\n\nspoliation of evidence) with Torres v. El Paso Elec. Co., 987 P.2d\n\n386, 404 (N.M. 1999) (recognizing a tort for the intentional\n\nspoliation of evidence).\n\n            We agree with the magistrate judge and the district court\n\nthat, even    supposing   the   Rhode   Island   Supreme   Court   were   to\n\nrecognize a spoliation tort, Ms. Malinowski has not set forth\n\nspecific facts making out such a hypothetical cause of action in\n\nher case.    Perhaps most telling is the absence of a factual basis\n\nfrom which to conclude that DVD or UPS destroyed evidence so as to\n\naffect her ability to obtain a favorable judgment in the wrongful\n\ndeath action. While Ms. Malinowski's counsel argues that, from the\n\ndate of the accident, UPS, along with DVD, conspired to destroy and\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fdid destroy evidence related to the speed of the vehicle and\n\nfurther, that the evidence related to speed was critical to the\n\noutcome of the trial, the allegations lack material support in the\n\nrecord.    In the few states that recognize an independent tort for\n\nspoliation of evidence, courts have required, inter alia, that a\n\nparty show a causal relationship between the act of spoliation and\n\nthe inability of the complainant to prove her lawsuit.           See, e.g.,\n\nOliver v. Stimson Lumber Co., 993 P.2d 11 (Mont. 1999); Torres v.\n\nEl Paso Elec. Co., 987 P.2d 386, 401 (N. Mex. 1999).\n\n            To support her spoliation claim, Ms. Malinowski relies\n\nheavily on the discoloration of the tachograph disc and other\n\nevidence that the disc was in poor condition.            According to Ms.\n\nMalinowski, \"[t]he tachograph was willfully destroyed\" by either\n\nUPS or DVD and, as a result, she \"was unable to prove her case in\n\nstate court.\"\n\n            However, there is nothing to show that the poor condition\n\nof   the   disc   affected   its   accuracy   or   readability   so   as   to\n\ncompromise its use at trial.       To be sure, there was a dispute over\n\nwhether the speed reading rendered by the tachograph was too high\n\nbecause of some mechanical malfunction.            During the first trial,\n\nthe tachograph disc was admitted without limitation to show both\n\nthe vehicle's speed and rate of acceleration at the time of the\n\naccident. While the disc was admittedly in a \"darkened condition,\"\n\nthis did not prevent Ms. Malinowski's counsel from eliciting the\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\ffavorable testimony desired from a UPS supervisor showing the\n\ndisc's reading as to the speed of the vehicle at the time of the\n\naccident, as well as its acceleration.         UPS was allowed to counter\n\nthe evidence with testimony that the readings were not accurate\n\nbecause of problems with the vehicle's speed gear that had preceded\n\nthe accident -- problems bearing no apparent relation to the\n\nsubsequent readability of the disc or to the claim of post-accident\n\nspoliation of evidence.        In the second trial, Ms. Malinowski's\n\ncounsel again tried to introduce the disc as evidence of the\n\nvehicle's    excessive     speed.    After    UPS   had   objected   and   had\n\npresented evidence of mechanical error preceding the accident, the\n\ntrial judge disallowed the use of the tachograph disc as it related\n\nto the speed of the vehicle, finding that Ms. Malinowski had failed\n\nto lay a sufficient foundation showing the accuracy of the speed\n\nreading.    But the trial judge admitted the tachograph disc for the\n\nlimited     purpose   of   showing    the    vehicle's    acceleration     and\n\ndeceleration patterns. The court's exclusion of the disc's reading\n\nas to speed was not linked to the discoloration or poor condition\n\nof the disc itself.\n\n             The reports from Ms. Malinowski's experts in tachograph\n\nanalysis, Mr. Robert Blancarte and Dr. Nigel Kirkwood, further\n\nweaken Ms. Malinowski's assertion that the condition of the disc\n\nprevented her from obtaining a favorable jury verdict.           While both\n\nMr. Blancarte and Dr. Kirkwood noted the poor condition of the\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fdisc, each was apparently able to read and analyze the information\n\non the disc.    Indeed, they challenged DVD's report that the speed\n\nshown on the disc was inaccurate, instead defending the accuracy of\n\nthe information obtained from the disc.   Mr. Blancarte stated that\n\nthe DVD report \"in no way established any error with the vehicle\n\nand the chart speeds.\"      Rather than suggest that the disc was\n\nirreparably damaged, both reports tend to support the proposition\n\nthat the disc was readable and should have been accepted in\n\nevidence at the second trial, as it was at the first trial, to show\n\nthe driver's true speed.    That position is inconsistent with the\n\nview that the disc had been so destroyed, mutilated or altered by\n\ndefendants as to render it defective as trial evidence.\n\n          We note further that the Rhode Island courts believed it\n\nunlikely the exclusion of the speed evidence at the second trial\n\ninfluenced the outcome.    The Rhode Island Supreme Court upheld the\n\ntrial judge's decision to exclude the portions of the tachograph\n\ndisc related to speed in the absence of an expert opinion regarding\n\nits accuracy.    The court went on to state:\n\n          Further, the jury heard the most compelling\n          information revealed by the tachograph -- that\n          Hogan had failed to decelerate upon seeing\n          Michael and his friends, and in fact, had\n          accelerated continuously from the previous\n          traffic signal. Finally, speed may not have\n          been a factor in this accident because it was\n          undisputed that Michael was struck by the rear\n          wheels of the truck and after the accident he\n          was lying approximately fifty-three feet from\n          the rear of the trailer.\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fMalinowski II, 792 A.2d at 54. This determination was echoed again\n\nby the court when it concluded that the \"newly discovered\" evidence\n\nregarding the potential spoliation of the tachograph disc \"was not\n\nmaterial enough to affect the outcome of the trial.\"\n\nIII.        CONCLUSION\n\n            Even were the Rhode Island Supreme Court to recognize an\n\nindependent tort for the spoliation of evidence, Ms. Malinowski has\n\nfailed to demonstrate her ability to establish all the essential\n\nelements.     The   order   of   the    district   court   granting   summary\n\njudgment to DVD and UPS is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\f",

The Appellant, Elaina Malinowski, appeals\n\nfrom the district court's order granting summary judgment to\n\nAppellees, United Parcel Service, Inc. (\"UPS\") and Documented\n\nVehicle/Drivers Systems, Inc. (\"DVD\").           Ms. Malinowski argues that\n\nthe district court erred when it ruled that the Rhode Island\n\nSupreme    Court    would     not    recognize   an   independent     tort   for\n\nspoliation of evidence and that it further erred in concluding\n\nthat, even supposing it did recognize such a cause of action, she\n\nfailed to meet the essential elements.           We find it unnecessary to\n\nrule on the first ground and affirm on the second ground.\n\nI.          BACKGROUND\n\n            On     December    27,    1991,   fourteen   year   old    Michael\n\nMalinowski was struck and killed by a UPS tractor trailer operated\n\nby Stephen Hogan.        The accident occurred as Michael and three\n\nfriends were walking along Taunton Avenue in East Providence,\n\nengaged in horseplay, jumping and shoving each other.               As the UPS\n\ntruck approached the four boys, Michael was pushed by one of his\n\nfriends.    He lost his balance and fell into the road just as the\n\nUPS truck passed.\n\n            The accident was investigated by the State Police and by\n\nUPS.   After the State Police had completed their inspection of the\n\ntruck, a UPS supervisor, James Kershaw, removed a \"tachograph disc\"\n\nfrom the vehicle.      Such a disc, consisting of a round coated paper\n\nchart, tells the movement and speed of the vehicle as recorded on\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fa tachograph located in the cab of the truck.                        UPS sent the\n\ntachograph disc to DVD in California for an independent analysis.\n\nOn January 6, 1992, DVD issued a report and returned the disc to\n\nUPS.    The DVD report stated that the tachograph disc \"has not been\n\nproperly    cared    for,\"    but   that    the    information      was    readable.\n\nAccording to DVD, the tachograph disc indicated a speed of about 33\n\nmiles per hour at the time of the accident.                  But the report also\n\nnoted   a   number   of     discrepancies     in    the    data,    as    well   as   a\n\n\"mechanical error in the recording device,\" and concluded that the\n\ndisc was of \"very little value\" in determining Hogan's actual speed\n\nat the time of the accident.               Upon receipt of the report, UPS\n\nplaced the tachograph disc and the report in an Accident Folder.\n\n            Apart    from    obtaining     the     DVD    report,   UPS    performed\n\nindependent tests on the truck, specifically a veeder test.                           A\n\nveeder test uses a meter installed in the transmission to check the\n\naccuracy of the speedometer/odometer, by driving the vehicle a\n\nmeasured distance.        The veeder test indicated that the tachograph\n\nin the vehicle was inaccurate by 26 percent, which, according to\n\nUPS, meant that the tachograph was recording speeds 26 percent\n\nhigher than the actual speed of the vehicle.\n\n            On September 27, 1993, Ms. Malinowski, individually and\n\nas administratrix of the estate of Michael, brought a wrongful\n\ndeath action in the Rhode Island state court against Stephen Hogan\n\nand UPS.     Ms. Malinowski alleged that Hogan, who had conceded\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fseeing the boys at the side of the road, was negligent and was\n\ndriving too fast as he approached the boys.    At the start of the\n\ntrial, in May 1997, Ms. Malinowski obtained the tachograph disc and\n\nDVD report from UPS.    The disc was discolored but readable.   The\n\ntrial judge, with some hesitation, admitted the tachograph disc as\n\nan exhibit.    Neither party sought to introduce the DVD report.\n\nOver defense objections, the court allowed Ms. Malinowski's counsel\n\nto elicit testimony regarding the speed reading on the disc.\n\nKershaw, the UPS supervisor, testified that the disc showed a speed\n\nof 32-33 miles per hour at the time of the accident.     The speed\n\nreading was in direct contradiction to Hogan's testimony that he\n\nwas traveling approximately 20 miles per hour at the time of the\n\naccident.   Kershaw also testified that the tachograph disc showed\n\n\"continuous\" or \"progressive\" acceleration of the vehicle up to the\n\ntime of the accident.    This testimony also contradicted Hogan's\n\nreport that he honked and decelerated when he saw the boys and then\n\naccelerated when it appeared that they had stopped their horseplay.\n\nIn response, UPS's counsel had Kershaw testify to the veeder test,\n\nexplaining how the veeder test had established that the tachograph\n\nspeed readings were inaccurate.\n\n            On May 21, 1997, the jury returned a verdict for the\n\ndefendants.    The plaintiff appealed and, in May 1999, the Rhode\n\nIsland Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded based upon\n\nerrors in the jury instructions not relevant here.   See Malinowski\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fv.

Neither\n\nside appealed from the court's rulings admitting into evidence the\n\ntachograph disc and the veeder test, and the Rhode Island Supreme\n\nCourt's opinion does not mention these rulings.\n\n             In October 1999, the case was assigned for a second trial\n\nbefore a different judge.       At the second trial, UPS challenged the\n\nadmissibility     of   the   tachograph   disc.   UPS   argued   that   the\n\nplaintiff had not produced an expert to establish the accuracy of\n\nthe tachograph, and that the available evidence was that the\n\ntachograph was not accurate.         The trial judge heard testimony,\n\noutside the presence of the jury, regarding the accuracy of the\n\ntachograph.     Kershaw testified to the UPS records of repairs to\n\nHogan's vehicle, which showed that what he termed the speed gear\n\nhad been inaccurate for two months prior to the accident and that\n\nreplacement parts had been ordered but were not installed until\n\nafter the accident.      Hogan testified that he had been aware of a\n\nproblem with the speedometer in his vehicle before the accident.\n\nAs a result, the trial judge concluded that the speed readings from\n\nthe tachograph should be excluded.           The court ruled that the\n\nevidence provided by the tachograph was scientific evidence and\n\nthat the plaintiff had not established a foundation regarding the\n\naccuracy of that evidence as it related to the speed of the truck.1\n\n\n     1\n         Specifically, the court stated:\n\n     For the tachograph readings as to speed to be admissible,\n\n                                    -5-\n\fHowever, because neither party contested the accuracy of the\n\nreading regarding the deceleration and acceleration of the vehicle,\n\ntestimony regarding that reading was to be allowed.\n\n             Thus,   the   second   jury    was    not   allowed    to    hear   the\n\ntachograph readings giving the vehicle's purported speed. The jury\n\nin the second trial did, however, hear Kershaw testify that the\n\nline    on    the    tachograph     chart       indicated     \"continuous\"        or\n\n\"progressive\" acceleration as the vehicle approached the point of\n\nthe accident.\n\n             At the end of the second trial, Ms. Malinowski's counsel\n\nsubmitted a proposed jury instruction based on a Rhode Island\n\nevidentiary    rule    that   permits      an    adverse    inference     for    the\n\nunexplained,    deliberate     destruction        or   mutilation   of    relevant\n\nevidence.

Barnes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2400787\"><a href=\"/opinion/2400787/state-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 145 (R.I.\n\n2001)   (describing    the    \"doctrine     of    spoliation\").          The   court\n\ndeclined to give a jury charge on spoliation.               The court observed\n\nthat the tachograph was in evidence and that the plaintiff had\n\nfailed to identify \"what evidence was the subject of an argument\n\nregarding spoliation.\"        On October 8, 1999, the jury returned a\n\nverdict for the defense.\n\n\n\n       there must be evidence that the tachograph was in good\n       working order and accurate at the time the recording of\n       speed was made. Absent an appropriate foundation as to\n       the accuracy of the tachograph speed reading, the\n       evidence as to the speed cannot be deemed relevant\n       scientific evidence to be placed before the jury.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f              Ms.     Malinowski    filed    numerous   post-trial   motions,\n\nincluding motions seeking a new trial.           The motions for a new trial\n\nwere based upon two theories:         a contention that the court erred in\n\nexcluding the tachograph speed reading, and a claim of \"newly\n\ndiscovered\" evidence.        In support of these motions, Ms. Malinowski\n\nsubmitted unsworn reports from two people averring to be experts in\n\ntachograph analysis.        Both individuals commented on the discolored\n\nnature   of     the    tachograph    disc,    one   citing   its   \"deplorable\n\ncondition\" and the other his difficulty in reading it.                     Ms.\n\nMalinowski cited these comments as evidence that either UPS or DVD\n\nhad tampered with the disc.          However, both individuals went on to\n\nreport data they had obtained from the disc and they did not\n\nsuggest that the condition of the disc had prevented them from\n\nreading it.     Indeed, except for a ten and a half mile error on the\n\nspeed stylus, one expert expressly found no evidence of error, and\n\nneither of them noted any problem understanding and analyzing the\n\ndisc notwithstanding its poor condition.\n\n              Mr. Resmini, Ms. Malinowski's counsel, also submitted an\n\naffidavit in which he stated that he had just \"discovered\" that DVD\n\nwas still in existence.            Based on a comment by a UPS employee\n\nduring the first trial, Mr. Resmini had believed that DVD had gone\n\nout of business and, as a result, he had not sought to investigate\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fDVD's involvement.2     Mr. Resmini also averred that he had spoken by\n\nphone with the current owner of DVD, Mr. Wilson, and that Mr.\n\nWilson had informed him that the tachograph disc was in extremely\n\npoor condition.        Mr.    Wilson,    however,   declined     to   submit   an\n\naffidavit averring to the condition of the disc or offer an opinion\n\nregarding its accuracy.\n\n             The trial court denied each of the post-trial motions.\n\nThe court expressly rejected Ms. Malinowski's argument that any\n\nalleged mishandling of the tachograph disc by UPS had prevented\n\nMalinowski from laying the foundation for admissibility of the\n\nspeed reading.      With regard to the motion for new trial, the court\n\nfirst    observed   that     Mr.   Resmini's   affidavit   was    inadmissible\n\nhearsay.     Second, the court noted that even if deemed admissible,\n\nthe information in the affidavit could have been discovered prior\n\nto trial.3     Third, the court held that, even if considered new\n\n\n     2\n      Mr. Resmini suggests that UPS attempted to prevent Ms.\nMalinowski from contacting DVD by misrepresenting under oath that\nDVD was no longer in existence.     During the first trial, Mr.\nResmini asked a UPS employee whether DVD was still in existence.\nThe employee responded: \"No, they are not. I really can't answer\nthat. We did try to contact them but -- .\" The testimony at issue\nis not a definitive statement of whether DVD remained in business\nnor does it explain why Mr. Resmini waited until after the second\ntrial to obtain independent verification of DVD's existence.\n\n     3\n      On this point, the court seemed somewhat perplexed by the\nlack of effort on Ms. Malinowski's part to diligently develop the\nevidence necessary to support her claims. The court observed:\n\n     The absence of diligence on the expert front by plaintiff\n     is remarkable. There was an obvious lack of diligence\n\n                                        -8-\n\fevidence, the information probably would not have affected the\n\noutcome of trial.         The court concluded that \"[t]he evidence of\n\nactual speed is far less relevant than the evidence of acceleration\n\nor the other evidence of what actions Mr. Hogan did or did not take\n\n. . . .    I am not convinced that the introduction of evidence as to\n\nspeed would have altered the jury's verdict in this case . . . .\"4\n\n               Ms. Malinowski appealed, contending that the lower court\n\nerred     in   refusing   to   admit   the    tachograph   speed   reading   in\n\nevidence, in declining to charge the jury on spoliation, and in\n\ndenying the post-trial motions.              The Rhode Island Supreme Court\n\n\n\n     pertaining to the tachograph that predates even the first\n     trial.    There was no effort made by plaintiff [in\n     discovery] to request the tachograph or records bearing\n     on speed (which would have included the DVD report prior\n     to the first trial . . . .). When the plaintiff finally\n     learned about the tachograph and the defendant's expert\n     report by DVD during the first trial in 1997 (which was\n     six years post accident) no apparent effort was made from\n     that point until after the second trial in 1999 to have\n     the tachograph examined or to depose anyone at\n     DVD . . . .\n     4\n      The court had made a similar observation earlier in the\nhearing.\n\n     [E]ven assuming, arguendo, that the evidence as to speed,\n     as registered on the tachograph, should have been\n     admitted, this Court is not convinced that it would have\n     altered the result of this case. After all, the jury in\n     the first trial heard this evidence and reached the same\n     conclusion as the second jury, albeit with different jury\n     instructions . . . . More importantly, the more critical\n     evidence as to speed was not so much the actual speed of\n     the truck but the evidence of continued acceleration\n     (which this Court allowed).\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\faffirmed the rulings of the lower court, concluding that each of\n\nthe   rulings      was    an   appropriate     exercise       of   discretion.

The court opined that \"the jury heard the most\n\ncompelling information revealed by the tachograph -- that Hogan had\n\nfailed to decelerate upon seeing [the boys] . . . .\"                       Id. at 54.\n\nThe court further recognized that \"speed may not have been a factor\n\nin this accident because it is undisputed that Michael was struck\n\nby the rear wheels of the truck . . . .\"                Id.\n\n              Following the dismissal of her appeal in the wrongful\n\ndeath action, Ms. Malinowski brought this independent tort action\n\nin the Rhode Island state court claiming that the condition of the\n\ntachograph    disc       was   the   cause   of   her   inability     to     obtain   a\n\nfavorable jury verdict in the wrongful death action.                   According to\n\nMs. Malinowski, had the tachograph not been \"destroyed\" it would\n\nhave shown that Hogan was traveling at an excess speed at the time\n\nof the accident and that he failed to slow down when he observed\n\nthe boys in horseplay -- in direct contradiction to Hogan's own\n\ntestimony.      DVD and UPS removed the action to federal court.\n\n             DVD    and    UPS   immediately      filed   motions      for    summary\n\njudgment, arguing, inter alia, that Rhode Island did not recognize\n\na separate and independent tort for spoliation.                    Magistrate Judge\n\nLovegreen granted summary judgment to UPS and DVD.                   In a thorough\n\nreport and recommendation, he noted that the Rhode Island Supreme\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fCourt had     not   recognized   a   separate   and   independent   tort   of\n\nspoliation, and went on to hold that it was unlikely Rhode Island\n\nwould do so given the problems such a tort would create and the\n\nfact that a majority of \"the states' highest courts considering\n\nthis issue have declined to adopt a separate and independent cause\n\nof action for spoliation of evidence.\" Malinowski v. United Parcel\n\nServ., Inc., C.A. 01-273ML, report and recommendation, at 9 (D.R.I.\n\nMay 10, 2002).       The magistrate judge further held that even if\n\nRhode Island recognized such a tort, Ms. Malinowski had failed to\n\nadduce evidence that would establish its elements in her own case.\n\nId. at 20.    Hence, she had not shown that the disc's discoloration\n\nand poor condition were the cause of her inability to have obtained\n\na favorable jury verdict.        Id. at 21.     The magistrate judge noted\n\nthat although the independent experts that Ms. Malinowski had\n\nretained to review the tachograph disc after the second trial had\n\ncommented on its poor condition, they were still able to read and\n\nanalyze the contents of the disc.       The disc had not been destroyed,\n\nmutilated or significantly altered as would be required to make out\n\na spoliation tort.     Moreover, in the absence of evidence of why the\n\ndisc was in poor condition there was insufficient proof that\n\ndefendants had intended to damage the disc.\n\n             Ms. Malinowski objected to the report and recommendation\n\nof the magistrate judge.          The district court agreed with the\n\nmagistrate judge's conclusion that Rhode Island would not recognize\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fan independent tort for the spoliation of evidence.          Malinowski v.\n\nUnited Parcel Serv., Inc., No. 01-273ML, slip op. at 1 (D.R.I. June\n\n17, 2002).    The district court went on to conclude that even if the\n\ntort were available, the Rhode Island Supreme Court's decision in\n\nMalinowski II regarding the lack of materiality of the alleged\n\n\"newly discovered\" evidence of spoliation eliminated an essential\n\nelement of such a tort claim.           Id. at 2.      The district court\n\nentered judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants.\n\n             This appeal followed.\n\nII.

While both the\n\nmagistrate judge and the district court judge concluded that the\n\nRhode Island Supreme Court would not create such a tort, we see no\n\nneed to delve into the unchartered waters of Rhode Island law and\n\nendeavor to prophesize whether the Rhode Island Supreme Court would\n\nadopt an independent tort for spoliation of evidence.

Perhaps most telling is the absence of a factual basis\n\nfrom which to conclude that DVD or UPS destroyed evidence so as to\n\naffect her ability to obtain a favorable judgment in the wrongful\n\ndeath action. While Ms. Malinowski's counsel argues that, from the\n\ndate of the accident, UPS, along with DVD, conspired to destroy and\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fdid destroy evidence related to the speed of the vehicle and\n\nfurther, that the evidence related to speed was critical to the\n\noutcome of the trial, the allegations lack material support in the\n\nrecord.    In the few states that recognize an independent tort for\n\nspoliation of evidence, courts have required, inter alia, that a\n\nparty show a causal relationship between the act of spoliation and\n\nthe inability of the complainant to prove her lawsuit.           See, e.g.,\n\nOliver v. Stimson Lumber Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"884844\"><a href=\"/opinion/884844/oliver-v-stimson-lumber-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mont. 1999); Torres v.\n\nEl Paso Elec.

Mex. 1999).\n\n            To support her spoliation claim, Ms. Malinowski relies\n\nheavily on the discoloration of the tachograph disc and other\n\nevidence that the disc was in poor condition.            According to Ms.\n\nMalinowski, \"[t]he tachograph was willfully destroyed\" by either\n\nUPS or DVD and, as a result, she \"was unable to prove her case in\n\nstate court.\"\n\n            However, there is nothing to show that the poor condition\n\nof   the   disc   affected   its   accuracy   or   readability   so   as   to\n\ncompromise its use at trial.       To be sure, there was a dispute over\n\nwhether the speed reading rendered by the tachograph was too high\n\nbecause of some mechanical malfunction.            During the first trial,\n\nthe tachograph disc was admitted without limitation to show both\n\nthe vehicle's speed and rate of acceleration at the time of the\n\naccident. While the disc was admittedly in a \"darkened condition,\"\n\nthis did not prevent Ms. Malinowski's counsel from eliciting the\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\ffavorable testimony desired from a UPS supervisor showing the\n\ndisc's reading as to the speed of the vehicle at the time of the\n\naccident, as well as its acceleration.         UPS was allowed to counter\n\nthe evidence with testimony that the readings were not accurate\n\nbecause of problems with the vehicle's speed gear that had preceded\n\nthe accident -- problems bearing no apparent relation to the\n\nsubsequent readability of the disc or to the claim of post-accident\n\nspoliation of evidence.        In the second trial, Ms. Malinowski's\n\ncounsel again tried to introduce the disc as evidence of the\n\nvehicle's    excessive     speed.    After    UPS   had   objected   and   had\n\npresented evidence of mechanical error preceding the accident, the\n\ntrial judge disallowed the use of the tachograph disc as it related\n\nto the speed of the vehicle, finding that Ms. Malinowski had failed\n\nto lay a sufficient foundation showing the accuracy of the speed\n\nreading.    But the trial judge admitted the tachograph disc for the\n\nlimited     purpose   of   showing    the    vehicle's    acceleration     and\n\ndeceleration patterns. The court's exclusion of the disc's reading\n\nas to speed was not linked to the discoloration or poor condition\n\nof the disc itself.\n\n             The reports from Ms. Malinowski's experts in tachograph\n\nanalysis, Mr. Robert Blancarte and Dr. Nigel Kirkwood, further\n\nweaken Ms. Malinowski's assertion that the condition of the disc\n\nprevented her from obtaining a favorable jury verdict.           While both\n\nMr. Blancarte and Dr. Kirkwood noted the poor condition of the\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fdisc, each was apparently able to read and analyze the information\n\non the disc.    Indeed, they challenged DVD's report that the speed\n\nshown on the disc was inaccurate, instead defending the accuracy of\n\nthe information obtained from the disc.   Mr. Blancarte stated that\n\nthe DVD report \"in no way established any error with the vehicle\n\nand the chart speeds.\"      Rather than suggest that the disc was\n\nirreparably damaged, both reports tend to support the proposition\n\nthat the disc was readable and should have been accepted in\n\nevidence at the second trial, as it was at the first trial, to show\n\nthe driver's true speed.    That position is inconsistent with the\n\nview that the disc had been so destroyed, mutilated or altered by\n\ndefendants as to render it defective as trial evidence.\n\n          We note further that the Rhode Island courts believed it\n\nunlikely the exclusion of the speed evidence at the second trial\n\ninfluenced the outcome.    The Rhode Island Supreme Court upheld the\n\ntrial judge's decision to exclude the portions of the tachograph\n\ndisc related to speed in the absence of an expert opinion regarding\n\nits accuracy.    The court went on to state:\n\n          Further, the jury heard the most compelling\n          information revealed by the tachograph -- that\n          Hogan had failed to decelerate upon seeing\n          Michael and his friends, and in fact, had\n          accelerated continuously from the previous\n          traffic signal. Finally, speed may not have\n          been a factor in this accident because it was\n          undisputed that Michael was struck by the rear\n          wheels of the truck and after the accident he\n          was lying approximately fifty-three feet from\n          the rear of the trailer.\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fMalinowski II, 792 A.2d at 54. This determination was echoed again\n\nby the court when it concluded that the \"newly discovered\" evidence\n\nregarding the potential spoliation of the tachograph disc \"was not\n\nmaterial enough to affect the outcome of the trial.\"\n\nIII.        CONCLUSION\n\n            Even were the Rhode Island Supreme Court to recognize an\n\nindependent tort for the spoliation of evidence, Ms. Malinowski has\n\nfailed to demonstrate her ability to establish all the essential\n\nelements.     The   order   of   the    district   court   granting   summary\n\njudgment to DVD and UPS is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\f</pre>",
