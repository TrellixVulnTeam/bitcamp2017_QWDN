While still working at WRC, James and Bogosian formed a\n\nseparate real estate company, E & J Realty (E & J), from which\n\nHarry was excluded.\n\n             In 1981, Bogosian acquired an option to purchase real\n\nestate in Fall River, Massachusetts (\"Fall River property\") in the\n\nname of \"Taunton River Enterprises.\"          For more than two years, WRC\n\nremitted fees and $3,000 monthly to maintain her purchase-option\n\ncontract.       The record is silent         as to whether WRC was ever\n\nreimbursed by Bogosian.         Be that as it may and unbeknownst to\n\nJames, Bogosian exercised the purchase option in 1984, in the name\n\nof E & J, rather than WRC, thereby effectively excluding Harry\n\nWoloohojian from the deal.          Subsequently, when Harry confronted\n\nJames regarding Bogosian's acquisition of the Fall River property\n\nthrough E & J, James assured Harry that he regarded the property as\n\nan asset of WRC, rather than E & J, then promised to help Harry\n\nregain title to the property on behalf of WRC.              By 1986, James and\n\nHarry, having become fully reconciled, voted to install James in\n\nplace   of    Bogosian   as   the   WRC   president.        Although    Bogosian\n\nimmediately     ceased   to    perform      any   further    services    as   an\n\nofficer/employee, she continued to draw her full salary from WRC.\n\n             In 1987, James, Harry, and WRC instituted a civil action\n\nin the Massachusetts courts against Bogosian and E & J (\"Fall River\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\flitigation\"), claiming that the decision by Bogosian to acquire the\n\nFall River real estate in the name of E & J constituted a wrongful\n\nusurpation of a corporate opportunity belonging to WRC.                     The\n\ncomplaint demanded      that   title   to   the   Fall   River   property    be\n\nconveyed to WRC, which resulted in a lis pendens against the\n\nproperty.      Meanwhile,   Bogosian    had   received    three    offers   to\n\npurchase the Fall River property, ranging from five to eleven\n\nmillion dollars. These offers were never consummated, however, for\n\nreasons unrelated to the lis pendens.\n\n             In 1988-89, James Woloohojian, in his capacity as the\n\npresident of WRC, fired Bogosian and her children.                Thereafter,\n\nBogosian brought the instant diversity action in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Rhode Island.              The three-count\n\namended complaint alleged that WRC, as well as James and Harry\n\nWoloohojian,     had   breached,   and/or    conspired   to    breach,   their\n\nfiduciary duties to her by \"freezing her out\" of her positions as\n\npresident, minority shareholder, and employee of WRC, and demanded\n\nthe dissolution of WRC (count 3).2          In order to avoid a corporate\n\n\n     2\n         R. I. Gen. Laws § 7-1.1-90(a)(1)(ii) provides, in pertinent\npart:\n\n             The superior court has full power to liquidate\n             the assets and business of a corporation . . .\n             [i]n an action by a shareholder when it is\n             established that, whether or not the corporate\n             business has been or could be operated at a\n             profit, dissolution would be beneficial to the\n             shareholders because . . . [t]he acts of the\n             directors   or  those   in   control   of  the\n\n                                    -6-\n\fdissolution, however, the defendants elected to purchase Bogosian's\n\nWRC shares at \"fair value,\" pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 7-1.1-\n\n90.1.3 Subsequently, the district court directed the defendants to\n\ncommence making payments into the court registry.                   The defendants\n\nresponded with a counterclaim asserting that Bogosian had converted\n\nother WRC funds to her personal use as well.\n\n              In   1992,    the        Fall   River     litigation    pending    in\n\nMassachusetts state court was terminated following a jury finding\n\nthat Bogosian had not usurped a WRC corporate opportunity.\n\n              In 1993, after Bogosian's many creditors asserted claims\n\nto the monies previously deposited in the court registry by WRC,\n\nWRC   responded     with    an    interpleader        action.   Thereafter,      the\n\ndistrict court directed an administrative consolidation of the\n\ninterpleader       action   with       the    pending    proceeding    brought    by\n\n\n              corporation        are    illegal,      oppressive,     or\n              fraudulent.\n      3\n          Section 7-1.1-90.1 provides, in pertinent part:\n\n              Whenever a petition for dissolution of a\n              corporation   is    filed  by  one  or   more\n              shareholders . . . pursuant to either §\n              7-1.1-90 or a right to compel dissolution\n              which is authorized under § 7-1.1-51 or is\n              otherwise valid, one or more of its other\n              shareholders may avoid the dissolution by\n              filing   with    the   court  prior  to   the\n              commencement of the hearing, or, in the\n              discretion of the court, at any time prior to\n              a sale or other disposition of the assets of\n              the corporation, an election to purchase the\n              shares owned by the petitioner at a price\n              equal to their fair value.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fBogosian.\n\n            In 1997, the district court (Boyle, S.D.J.) entered a\n\nfinal decision as to count 3, establishing a fair value for the\n\nshare buy-out.    Bogosian v. Woloohojian Realty Corp., 973 F. Supp.\n\n98, 106-07 (D.R.I. 1997).      Thereafter, we sustained the district\n\ncourt ruling in part, but vacated its decision relating to two\n\npertinent matters.     First, the district court was directed to\n\ndetermine   the   one-third   share   of   the   tax   liability,   due   by\n\nBogosian, which had been incurred by WRC when it was compelled to\n\nsell some of its real property to fund its purchase of Bogosian's\n\nremaining shares.      Second, we decided that Bogosian would be\n\nentitled to 11% simple prejudgment interest, rather than 11%\n\ncompound interest.     Bogosian v. Woloohojian, 158 F.3d 1, 9 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n            On remand, the district court (Lagueux, D.J.) established\n\nthe post-tax, buy-out amount at roughly $4 million, then applied a\n\n12% interest rate based on an intervening amendment to the Rhode\n\nIsland prejudgment-interest statute.        Accordingly, the defendants\n\nwere directed to remit approximately $7.8 million to Bogosian\n\npursuant to their § 7-1.1-90.1 election.         Bogosian v. Woloohojian,\n\n93 F. Supp. 2d 145, 159 (D.R.I. 2000).\n\n            In April 2000, after reopening discovery at Bogosian's\n\nrequest, the district court scheduled counts 1 and 2 for bench\n\ntrial in September 2000.       Thereafter, however, Bogosian sought\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fseveral continuances and further discovery, citing her retention of\n\nnew trial counsel and her recent surgery and treatment for lung\n\ncancer.\n\n            The district court granted the first two motions, but\n\nrejected a third, then set the trial date for May 8, 2001, and\n\npermitted Bogosian's trial testimony to be submitted by way of\n\ndeposition.      The district court conditioned its grant of the\n\nfurther continuances, however, by directing that no additional\n\ninterest was to accrue on the count 3 fund held in the court\n\nregistry.\n\n            Following the eventual bench trial, the district court\n\nruled for the defendants on both counts 1 and 2.                Bogosian v.\n\nWoloohojian, 167 F. Supp. 2d 491 (D.R.I. 2001). Among its findings\n\nof fact, the court determined that (i) the defendants had owed\n\nBogosian    a   fiduciary   duty,   in    her   capacity   as   a    minority\n\nshareholder; (ii) their removal of Bogosian as the WRC president in\n\n1986 had not breached their fiduciary duty to her, in that no WRC\n\nshareholder     had   any   reasonable      expectation    of       indefinite\n\nemployment, particularly after having elected to cease performing\n\nany further work for the company while continuing to receive full\n\nsalary; (iii) Bogosian had adduced no evidence that the defendants\n\nimpeded her in any way from performing her company responsibilities\n\nafter 1986; and (iv) James and Harry had not acted in bad faith\n\nwhen they initiated the Fall River litigation against Bogosian.\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fId. at 498-502.\n\n           Bogosian   now   appeals    from   the   final   district   court\n\njudgment in relation to all three counts.           The defendants cross-\n\nappeal from the district court ruling relating to the third count.\n\n                                      II\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\nA.   The Bogosian Appeal\n\n     1.    The Right to Jury Trial\n\n           Bogosian insists that the district court contravened the\n\nSeventh Amendment by failing to accord her a jury trial on counts\n\n1 and 2.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 38; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 39(b)\n\n(\"Issues not demanded for trial by jury as provided in Rule 38\n\nshall be tried by the court.\").            We conclude that the district\n\ncourt did not err.4\n\n           First, although Bogosian acknowledges that no jury-trial\n\ndemand was made in the amended complaint as to counts 1 and 2, and\n\nthat the defendants made no such demand in their answer, Bogosian's\n\nreply to their answer did demand a jury trial on defendants'\n\ncounterclaim. The counterclaim alleged that Bogosian had converted\n\nWRC funds to her personal use.        Bogosian contends that the issues\n\nat the heart of both her claims, as well as the counterclaim, were\n\n     4\n      We note that Bogosian has simply assumed that she is entitled\nto a jury trial under § 7-1.1-90, notwithstanding that a claim of\n\"breach of fiduciary duty\" has long been recognized as an equitable\ncause of action, to which no right to jury trial attaches. See In\nre Evangelist, 760 F.2d 27, 29 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\n                                  -10-\n\fso \"interwoven\" that the latter demand implicitly preserved her\n\nright   to   jury     trial   on    all    three       matters,    even     though   the\n\ndefendants ultimately dismissed their counterclaim prior to trial.\n\n             The     lone   case    citation       submitted       for    the    present\n\ncontention is wholly inapposite.                Gasoline Prods. Co. v. Champlin\n\nRef. Co., 283 U.S. 494 (1931), involved the entirely distinct\n\nmatter as to whether, upon remand for a new trial, the issues of\n\nliability and damages fairly may be addressed in separate trials.\n\nThe Supreme Court simply observed that issues of liability and\n\ndamages frequently          are    \"interwoven.\"         Id. at      500-01.        Thus,\n\nChamplin neither implicated the right to jury trial, nor in any\n\nsense remotely        suggested     that    the    right      to   jury    trial,    once\n\naffirmatively waived, must be restored due simply to the fact that\n\nthe opposing party in the litigation happens to have alleged a so-\n\ncalled \"interwoven\" counterclaim.\n\n             The Bogosian complaint and the appellees' counterclaim\n\nwere not \"interwoven,\" however, at least as concerns the right to\n\njury trial.        In counts 1 and 2 of the amended complaint, Bogosian\n\nalleged that appellees had breached their fiduciary duty to her as\n\na minority shareholder, by, inter alia, initiating the vexatious\n\nFall River litigation in which the appellees alleged that she had\n\nbreached     her    fiduciary      duty    to    WRC    by    usurping     a    corporate\n\nopportunity.          Bogosian      incorrectly         asserts     on    appeal     that\n\nappellees'     counterclaim         \"complained        that    [she]      breached    her\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\ffiduciary duty [to WRC] when she purchased options on the property\n\nin Fall River.\" (Emphasis added.)           Instead, in their counterclaim\n\nthe   appellees   merely   alleged    that    Bogosian   had   utilized   her\n\nofficial position in WRC to retain legal counsel to handle her own\n\n— as distinguished from corporate — legal matters, including the\n\nFall River litigation.\n\n            Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38(b) permits a party to\n\n\"demand a trial by jury of any issue triable of right by a jury,\"\n\nprovided the jury-trial demand is served within ten days \"after the\n\nservice of the last pleading directed to such issue.\"           Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 38(b).    Bogosian contends, in effect, that she was entitled to\n\na jury trial on counts 1 and 2 simply on the basis that her\n\ncomplaint and appellants' counterclaim arose from a common factual\n\nsetting, viz., the Fall River property litigation.             The right to\n\njury trial depends not upon the factual setting from which the\n\nclaim arose, however, but (i) upon whether the claim involves an\n\nissue \"triable of right by a jury,\" and (ii) upon the nature of the\n\ncause of action as well as its historical treatment in English-\n\nAmerican jurisprudence (viz., whether the proceedings are more\n\nemblematic of a \"legal\" proceeding, as distinguished from an\n\n\"equitable\" one).    See Tull v. United States, 481 U.S. 412, 417-18\n\n(1987); see also supra note 3.\n\n            Additionally, we are not presently confronted with the\n\nsituation in which two claims require factfinding on an element\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fcommon to both causes of action, such that the nonequitable claim\n\nmight need to be tried first to a jury.           Cf., e.g., Allison v.\n\nCitgo Petrolem Corp., 151 F.3d 402, 423-24 (5th Cir. 1998); Cabinet\n\nVision v. Cabinetware, 129 F.3d 595, 599-600 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Had\n\nthese appellees initially tried their counterclaim before a jury,\n\nthe lone pertinent factual element would have been whether the Fall\n\nRiver litigation related to Bogosian's personal business, such that\n\nshe would have been in breach of her fiduciary duty to WRC by\n\nhaving converted its funds for the purposes of retaining counsel to\n\nhandle her own case.     In contrast, Bogosian could prevail on her\n\nequitable claims in counts 1 and 2 only by demonstrating that the\n\nappellees had acted in bad faith by initiating the litigation\n\nrelating to the Fall River property — a finding neither essential\n\nto, nor an element of, their counterclaim for conversion.\n\n            Next, Bogosian asserts that she relied upon an inaccurate\n\ndocket entry by the clerk's office, which mistakenly stated:\n\n\"Defendant made a demand for a jury.\"             Yet Bogosian neither\n\nprovides a citation to the record on appeal, nor can we glean any\n\nsuch docket entry from the record on appeal, see Fed. R. App. P. 28\n\n(requiring that appellant cite to record as to each salient fact).\n\nMoreover,   not   only   was   she   a   \"defendant\"   as   to   appellees'\n\ncounterclaim, but even if any such docket entry did advert to the\n\nappellees in the singular (i.e., \"Defendant\"), Bogosian cites no\n\nauthority for the suggestion that reliance on an obvious clerical\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\ferror suffices to resurrect a right to jury trial previously\n\nwaived.\n\n             Lastly, Bogosian maintains that she opposed the district\n\ncourt ruling rejecting her motion to continue by asserting that the\n\nscheduling of counts 1 & 2 for bench trial abrogated her Seventh\n\nAmendment right to jury trial.         The present contention is patently\n\nflawed in at least two respects:         (i) her cursory objection failed\n\nto detail the nature of any putative error; and (ii) without more,\n\nno such belated objection can serve to resurrect a jury-trial right\n\nlong since waived.         See Fed. R. Civ. P. 38(d) (\"The failure of a\n\nparty   to   serve   and    file   a   demand   as   required   by   this   rule\n\nconstitutes a waiver by the party of trial by jury.\") (emphasis\n\nadded); Fed. R. Civ. P. 39(b) (noting that party who fails to make\n\ntimely request for jury trial may avoid waiver and secure a jury\n\ntrial only if the district court, in its discretion, acts favorably\n\non such a request).\n\n             Accordingly, we affirm the district court ruling that\n\nBogosian waived any right to trial by jury in relation to counts 1\n\n& 2.\n\n       2.    The Motions for Continuance\n             Relating to Counts 1 and 2\n\n             Next, Bogosian maintains that the district court erred in\n\ndenying her motions to postpone the bench trial due to her life-\n\nthreatening illness.        We review trial-management rulings for clear\n\nabuse of discretion and \"[o]nly an 'unreasoning and arbitrary\n\n                                       -14-\n\finsistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable\n\nrequest for delay will abuse [such discretion].'\"            N.E. Drilling,\n\nInc. v. Inner Space Servs., Inc., 243 F.3d 25, 36 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(citation omitted).        Our review examines, inter alia, the delay\n\nentailed, the reasons for the request, whether the moving party is\n\nat fault, any inconvenience to the court and litigants, and whether\n\nthe denial of a continuance unfairly would prejudice the moving\n\nparty.    See FDIC v. Houde, 90 F.3d 600, 608 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n               Although we recognize that Bogosian experiences serious\n\nhealth problems, the record on appeal plainly reflects that these\n\ndistrict court rulings were neither irrational nor arbitrary.\n\nFirst and foremost, by July 2000 when Bogosian submitted the\n\ninitial motion to continue the trial, this litigation had been\n\nlanguishing for twelve years.             Her motions were also predicated\n\nupon     her    recent   retention   of    new   counsel,   the   ninth   such\n\nsubstitution of counsel since she initiated her lawsuit.                  Even\n\nassuming       some   adequate   justification    for   Bogosian's   numerous\n\nreplacements of trial counsel, the attendant further delays plainly\n\nafforded additional legitimate grounds for the district court to\n\ncontinue to seek, wherever practicable, a fair and expeditious\n\ndisposition of the case.          See Amarin Plastics, Inc. v. Md. Cup\n\nCorp., 946 F.2d 147, 151 (1st Cir. 1991) (noting that trial court\n\nmay consider reasons for previous delays).\n\n               Second, medical doctors determined that Bogosian, then\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fage 77, suffered from several debilitating illnesses, including\n\nsevere arthritis and a serious anxiety disorder.           See Morrissey v.\n\nNat'l Mar. Union, 397 F. Supp. 659, 668 (S.D.N.Y. 1975) (noting\n\nunavailable     witness's     advanced      age   as   ground    for   denying\n\ncontinuance), aff'd, 544 F.2d 19, 32 (2d Cir. 1976).               As regards\n\nher metastatic lung cancer, Bogosian's doctors performed major\n\nsurgery (viz., a lobectomy), followed by an \"arduous\" course of\n\nconcurrent    radiation     and   chemotherapy,    which   was   expected   to\n\nprovide Bogosian with but a 30% to 50% prospect of long-term\n\nsurvival.    Although in more normal circumstances a continuance may\n\nwell have been warranted, there existed the very real prospect that\n\nany immediate postponement almost surely would deteriorate into an\n\nindefinite one given that Bogosian's physical condition was such as\n\nreasonably to suggest that it was improbable that she would ever\n\nbecome more available to assist counsel or testify at trial.                See\n\nAmarin Plastics, Inc., 946 F.2d at 152-53 (noting absence of any\n\nreasonable indication that party would ever improve enough to\n\nappear at trial);    Scholl v. Felmont Oil Corp., 327 F.2d 697, 700\n\n(6th Cir. 1964) (affirming denial of continuance absent any medical\n\nassurances that witness would ever be available to testify at\n\ntrial).\n\n             Third, trial counsel for Bogosian advised the district\n\ncourt at the September 2000 hearing that he intended to substitute\n\na \"limited liability\" family corporation as the lone plaintiff, in\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\forder        to     minimize       Bogosian's        continued      involvement     and\n\nparticipation in the proceedings.                   Plainly, such a representation\n\nby counsel strongly implied that other members of Bogosian's family\n\nwere       available       and   competent    to    assist    counsel     with   further\n\npretrial preparations.\n\n                  Fourth,        Bogosian's         protestations         on      appeal\n\nnotwithstanding, the district court granted her July 2000 motion to\n\ncontinue, thereby authorizing the requested 190-day extension,\n\nwhereupon the anticipated trial date was postponed to late March\n\n2001.        Moreover, the district court subsequently allowed yet\n\nanother motion for continuance, further postponing the trial to May\n\n8, 2001.\n\n                  Fifth,     Bogosian        submitted        no    updated      medical\n\ndocumentation that she remained unfit to testify at trial in May\n\n2001, even though her oncologist had represented in a November 3,\n\n2000, letter that her treatment would \"finish in late January\n\n[2001],\" and that he anticipated \"a month or so of post-treatment\n\nrecovery.\"5          Moreover, in a January 2001 follow-up letter, the\n\noncologist         reiterated      that   his      estimate    of   the   \"anticipated\n\nrecovery time for Ms. Bogosian from all her treatment would not be\n\nuntil the end of February of this year 2001.\"                       The January 2001\n\nletter was the final pretrial communication from her medical\n\n\n       5\n      The only medical evidence Bogosian presented consisted of\nletters from her doctor to her lawyer.   She adduced no medical\nrecords or affidavits whatsoever.\n\n                                             -17-\n\fprofessionals regarding when she would be able to testify at\n\ntrial.6   As the district court observed at trial, Bogosian \"still\n\nhas not shown she is incapable of testifying in open court.     All I\n\nhave is [counsel's] word that she is not able to come to court. I\n\nsee no doctor's certificate.\"\n\n           Moreover, the district court later allowed Bogosian's\n\ndeposition testimony to be admitted at trial.       Finally, Bogosian\n\nhas made no contention on appeal (let alone any showing) that her\n\ndeposition testimony was inherently inferior, in any respect, to\n\nher anticipated live testimony.    See Wells v. Rushing, 755 F.2d\n\n376, 380 (5th Cir. 1985) (noting that need for continuance becomes\n\nless compelling where testimony comes in by deposition).\n\n           Accordingly, given the totality of the circumstances, the\n\ndistrict court rulings regarding Bogosian's requests for a sick-\n\nleave-based    continuance   did   not   remotely     constitute   an\n\n\"'unreasoning and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the\n\nface of a justifiable request for delay.'\"     N.E. Drilling, Inc.,\n\n243 F.3d at 36 (citation omitted).7\n\n\n     6\n      At trial, Bogosian's counsel asserted that she remained\nunavailable to testify, noting that the January 2001 letter stated\nthat she would \"need several more months from the time of this\nwriting to recover.\" The doctor did not define the phrase \"several\nmonths,\" however, and in the remainder of the letter he repeatedly\nspecified that he expected her to \"recover[] from the side effects\nof treatment [by] . . . late February of [sic] March of this year.\"\n     7\n      Additionally, Bogosian faults a district court ruling made in\n2000, denying her further discovery requests relating to counts 1\nand 2. She argued then that events beyond her control (viz., her\n\n                                -18-\n\f        3.    The Motion for Continuance Relating to Count 3\n\n              In March 1998, Bogosian discovered a discarded CD-ROM\n\ncontaining hundreds of internal WRC documents.           One year later, as\n\ndirected on remand, see Bogosian, 158 F.3d at 9, the district court\n\nscheduled an evidentiary hearing to determine Bogosian's one-third\n\nportion of the tax liability which WRC incurred upon the sale of\n\ncertain corporate properties in order to generate the funds with\n\nwhich    to   acquire   her   WRC   shares,   pursuant   to   WRC's   count   3\n\nstatutory election.\n\n              The day before the scheduled hearing, Bogosian submitted\n\na motion to continue, citing a further need to extract and evaluate\n\nthe newly-discovered CD-ROM documents. She contended that at least\n\none of the extracted CD-ROM documents suggested that (i) WRC had\n\ncommitted fraud on the court at the pre-remand hearing regarding\n\ncount 3, during which the district court placed a valuation on the\n\nWRC assets and cash flow; (ii) a portion of the sales proceeds from\n\none piece of property was diverted covertly by WRC to other\n\ncorporate purposes; and (iii) WRC overstated, by one hundred\n\npercent, the capital gains it realized from the sale.\n\n\nillness and her former counsel's withdrawal) thwarted her discovery\nefforts. We review trial-court discovery rulings only for abuse of\ndiscretion. See Ameristar Jet Charter, Inc. v. Signal Composites,\nInc., 244 F.3d 189, 191-92 (1st Cir. 2001). We discern nothing\napproaching such abuse here. Appellant has been accorded ample\nopportunity to conduct discovery on these counts ever since 1989.\nMoreover, to the extent she now relies upon the contention that her\nformer counsel were derelict in pursuing discovery, her recourse,\nif any, obviously lies elsewhere.\n\n                                      -19-\n\f            Bogosian       now    maintains     that     (i)   the    district     court\n\nallowed    insufficient        time   for     her   to    retrieve     the   documents\n\nrelating    to    certain        suspicious     business       practices,      vaguely\n\ndescribed by her counsel as the marking-up of WRC's payroll and the\n\nmishandling      of   insurance       proceeds,     and     (ii)     these   documents\n\nreflected that WRC had initiated these activities prior to February\n\n1989 (viz., the date Bogosian was terminated), thus tending to\n\nsuggest that her brothers had a motive for freezing her out of WRC\n\n(viz., in order to conceal their own misfeasance from her).                          We\n\ndiscern    no    abuse    of     discretion    in   these      rulings.      See    N.E.\n\nDrilling, Inc., 243 F.3d at 35.\n\n            At the March 30 hearing, Bogosian sought a three-week\n\ndelay to study the contents of the CD-ROM.                         Over defendants'\n\nobjection, the district court allowed as how the proffered evidence\n\nappeared to be relevant to the disposition of count 3, then granted\n\nthe continuance.         Furthermore, when the district court proposed to\n\nsuspend the accrual of interest on the count 3 fund, Bogosian's\n\ncounsel expressed ready agreement.\n\n            Thereafter, at a hearing held on April 28, Bogosian's\n\ncounsel requested yet another thirty-day continuance within which\n\nto depose WRC's controller concerning the previously-discussed land\n\nsale, stating emphatically:            \"After 30 days is up, that's it, we\n\nare ready for trial,\" and \"[a]ll I am asking for is 30 days, and to\n\nget on with this trial.\"\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\f           On the ample basis of these representations, the district\n\ncourt granted the requested continuance for the limited purpose of\n\ndeposing the WRC controller.\n\n           At a hearing on July 30, however, Bogosian requested yet\n\nanother round of discovery — even though she had yet to depose the\n\nWRC controller — contending that (i) the CD-ROM documents had\n\ndemonstrated that the WRC had a much larger monthly cash flow in\n\n1996 than the $9,500 previously represented to the court, (ii) \"we\n\n. . . can envision a situation . . . where WRC was being used as a\n\nprivate cookie jar” [i.e., improperly and surreptiously to syphon\n\noff cash to its shareholders], (iii) WRC's so-called compulsion to\n\nsell its assets in order to buy out her shares probably was a ruse,\n\nand (iv) accordingly, Bogosian should not be held accountable for\n\nher one-third share of the tax liability associated with the sale\n\nof those shares.\n\n           The choice of the term \"envision\" by Bogosian's counsel\n\nwas telling indeed. Pressed by the court, counsel admitted that he\n\nhad no \"basis for claiming [that WRC did not have to sell the\n\nproperties],\" but that additional discovery might disclose cash\n\ndiversions by insiders.           Then and there, the district court made\n\nclear   that   it   would   not    permit       additional   discovery,     unless\n\n\"there's really newly discovered evidence here,\" and that Bogosian\n\nhad   submitted     no   motion    for    new    trial   \"showing   [any]    newly\n\ndiscovered evidence.\" Accordingly, the court denied the motion for\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\fadditional    discovery,      then    \"seriously\"    took    under   advisement\n\nappellees' motion for sanctions.\n\n            Given the exceptionally sorry travel of this case, the\n\ninstant contention can only be deemed utterly frivolous.                Far from\n\nabusing its discretion, the district court proceeded to allow the\n\ncontinuances requested by Bogosian's counsel to study the CD-ROM\n\ndocuments    and    conduct    limited      depositions.       Thereafter,    it\n\nreasonably drew the line when Bogosian acknowledged that she had no\n\nnewly-discovered     evidence        warranting   further     discovery.     See\n\nAmeristar Jet Charter, Inc. v. Signal Composites, 244 F.3d 189, 193\n\n(1st Cir. 2001) (noting that appellant \"concedes, however, that it\n\nhas no evidence that it will receive contradictory testimony. . .\n\n[and] [w]e will not allow [it] to go on a 'fishing expedition,'\n\nwith the     mere   'hope'    that    it   will   obtain    such   information\")\n\n(citation omitted).8\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      Bogosian additionally contends that the district court erred\nin calculating her share of the tax liability WRC incurred in\nselling its assets to fund the purchase of her shares. She devotes\none cursory paragraph to this contention in her appellate brief,\nand engages in no argumentation on its merits.        Instead, she\ninvites our perusal of the record on appeal to divine the substance\nof the arguments she advanced in the district court.             We\naccordingly deem her argument waived on appeal.        See FDIC v.\nLeBlanc, 85 F.3d 815, 820 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"'[I]ssues adverted to\nin a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\nargumentation, [will be] deemed waived for purposes of appeal.'\")\n(citation omitted).\n\n                                       -22-\n\f     4.   The Evidentiary Rulings Relating to Counts 1 & 2\n\n          a)   The Motion to Quash Subpoena\n               Served Upon Opposing Counsel\n\n          Next, Bogosian contends that the district court made\n\nseveral erroneous rulings at trial.     First, she suggests that her\n\ndue-process rights were violated when the district court (i)\n\nquashed her subpoena against opposing counsel, William Grimm, and\n\n(ii) barred Bogosian from submitting a proffer as to the substance\n\nof Grimm's anticipated testimony.      See Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)(2).\n\n          Trial court rulings on motions to quash are reviewed only\n\nfor abuse of discretion.   See Town of Norfolk v. U.S. Army Corps of\n\nEng'rs, 968 F.2d 1438, 1456 (1st Cir. 1992). Although not strictly\n\nforbidden, the procurement of trial testimony from opposing counsel\n\nis generally disfavored.     See United States v. Yonkers Bd. of\n\nEduc., 946 F.2d 180, 185 (2d Cir. 1991).       Among the appropriate\n\nfactors for consideration by the trial court are the following:\n\nwhether (i) the subpoena was issued primarily for purposes of\n\nharassment, (ii) there are other viable means to obtain the same\n\nevidence, and (iii) to what extent the information sought is\n\nrelevant, nonprivileged, and crucial to the moving party's case.\n\nSee Pamida, Inc. v. E.S. Originals, Inc., 281 F.3d 726, 729-30 (8th\n\nCir. 2002); Gould, Inc. v. Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co., Ltd., 825\n\nF.2d 676, 680 n.2 (2d Cir. 1987).\n\n          At trial, Bogosian maintained (i) that she had two\n\ninternal WRC documents which would show that Mr. Grimm had been a\n\n                                -23-\n\fWRC director in 1989-90, (ii) that during this same period WRC had\n\nengaged in suspicious business practices, vaguely described by her\n\ncounsel as the marking-up of its payroll and the mishandling of\n\ninsurance    proceeds;   (iii)   that   these   marked-up   documents\n\ndemonstrated that WRC initiated these activities prior to February\n\n1989 (viz., the date Bogosian was terminated), thus tending to\n\nindicate that her brothers had a motive for freezing her out of the\n\ncompany (viz., in order to conceal their misfeasance from her). We\n\ndiscern no abuse of discretion whatsoever by the district court.\n\n            As evidence of her apparent intent to harass the defense,\n\nwe note that Bogosian (i) served the subpoena the day before trial,\n\nwithout the slightest attempt to explain why she had failed to\n\ndepose opposing counsel during the preceding ten-year period of\n\nongoing discovery, (ii) requested that Mr. Grimm produce eighteen\n\nbroadly-described categories of corporate documents spanning more\n\nthan two decades (i.e., since 1980), (iii) made no showing that she\n\nwas unable to obtain the evidence from other sources, particularly\n\nWRC, their rightful owner, (iv) requested that Mr. Grimm testify at\n\ntrial solely to the \"existence[] or ... authenticity\" of the two\n\ndocuments, testimony she obviously could have obtained from any\n\nnumber of witnesses other than Mr. Grimm, (v) sought testimony from\n\nMr. Grimm which was marginally relevant at most, in that the two\n\ndocuments postdated the \"freeze-out.\"        Finally, the testimony\n\nsought from Mr. Grimm — in all likelihood and for the most part —\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fwould have been cumulative, since Bogosian herself adduced other\n\nevidence that her brothers had \"frozen her out\" in order to conceal\n\nfrom her their alleged corporate shenanigans.\n\n            Accordingly and for the foregoing reasons, the district\n\ncourt ruling quashing the subpoena must be affirmed.\n\n            b)   The Adverse Inference Sought Based On the\n                 Failure of Certain Defendants to Appear at Trial\n\n            Bogosian next contends that the district court erred in\n\ndeclining to infer — from the failure of defendants James and Z.\n\nElaine Woloohojian to appear at trial — that their testimony would\n\nhave been adverse to the defense.          She points to the putative\n\ntestimony   of   her   process   server   that   these   defendants   made\n\nthemselves unavailable to testify by evading service of process.9\n\nWe discern no error.\n\n            The \"missing witness\" rule permits, rather than compels,\n\nthe factfinder to draw an adverse inference from the absence of a\n\nwitness, see Niziolek v. Ashe, 694 F.2d 282, 292 (1st Cir. 1982),\n\nparticularly where the factfinder concludes that the party who\n\nrequested the adverse inference failed to subpoena a witness\n\notherwise   available    to   testify,    see   Trump   Plaza   Assocs.   v.\n\n\n\n     9\n      Bogosian also argues that the district court violated her\ndue-process rights in precluding her Rule 103(a)(2) proffer that\nkey witnesses (e.g., her sister-in-law, Z. Elaine Woloohojian),\nwhom she subpoenaed to appear at trial, deliberately had evaded her\nprocess server. The record discloses, however, that her counsel,\nearlier in the trial, stated that he had made this very proffer.\nSee Trial Tr. (5/8/01), at 11.\n\n                                  -25-\n\fPoskanzer (In re Poskanzer), 143 B.R. 991, 998 (Bankr. D.N.J.\n\n1992).    As the finder of fact, of course, it was for the district\n\ncourt to determine the credibility of the proffer Bogosian made\n\nregarding the process server's testimony.\n\n            In so doing, the district court simply concluded that\n\nJames and Z. Elaine Woloohojian had not evaded service of process.\n\nAs such credibility determinations are within the unique province\n\nof the trier of fact, see Carr v. PMS Fishing Corp., 191 F.3d 1, 7\n\n(1st Cir. 1999), the district court was not compelled to draw the\n\nsuggested adverse inference from the absence of James and Z. Elaine\n\nWoloohojian at trial.10\n\n     5.     The Factfinding in\n            Relation to Counts 1 & 2\n\n            Finally, Bogosian insists that the district court, in\n\nfinding for the appellees on counts 1 and 2, committed various\n\nerrors of law and ignored unrebutted evidence favorable to her\n\ncase.     Following a bench trial, the district court's findings of\n\nfact, including its witness-credibility assessments, are reviewed\n\nfor clear error only.   See Barrs v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 287 F.3d\n\n202, 210 (1st Cir. 2002); Carr, 191 F.3d at 7.   The outcome in the\n\n\n     10\n      Further, it may well be that any such adverse inference, in\nitself, would have been considered marginally probative, given the\nfact that James and Z. Elaine Woloohojian were not \"missing\nwitnesses\" at all, since their depositions were admitted at trial.\nSee Cameo Convalescent Ctr., Inc. v. Senn, 738 F.2d 836, 844 (7th\nCir. 1984) (noting that any such adverse inference becomes less\ncompelling where testimony of witness is admitted at trial by way\nof deposition).\n\n                                -26-\n\finstant    case       turned       principally       upon     just      such     credibility\n\ndeterminations.\n\n               The     district      court      explicitly         credited       appellees'\n\ntestimony that Bogosian was fired solely because she voluntarily\n\nceased performing any work at WRC, while continuing to draw full\n\nsalary and benefits.            Bogosian, 167 F. Supp. 2d at 503 (\"This court\n\ncredits the testimony of James and Harry.\").                        Undaunted, Bogosian\n\nincorrectly      asserts        on   appeal     that    her      late    brother,       Harry,\n\nprovided unrebutted deposition testimony that the actual basis for\n\nher termination had been that she sought to audit the corporate\n\nbooks.    Instead, Harry simply attested to the fact that Bogosian\n\nhad requested the audit and questioned the defendants' motives.\n\nHarry    did    not       state,     however,    that       this     was    what       prompted\n\nBogosian's discharge.\n\n               Thus,      the   mere    description         of     Bogosian's          requests\n\ncertainly did not compel the district court to determine, as a\n\nfact, either that her audit requests were justified or that she was\n\nfired by her brothers in order to prevent her revelation of their\n\nimproper business practices.                 Indeed, Bogosian has never adduced\n\nany corroborative evidence whatsoever in regard to her allegations.\n\n               Instead,      Bogosian       simply     maintains        that     she    adduced\n\nevidence that Harry was not terminated by WRC in the early 1980's\n\nfor failure          to   perform     his   corporate       duties,        and   that     WRC's\n\ndisparate treatment of her belies appellees' purportedly legitimate\n\n\n                                             -27-\n\fbasis   for    terminating   her.      The   district   court   reasonably\n\ndetermined, however, that Bogosian was well aware — regardless\n\nwhether Harry should have been fired earlier — that she was\n\nknowingly inviting termination by her refusal to perform her own\n\ncorporate responsibilities.         Thus, although a rational factfinder\n\nconceivably may have inferred some such nefarious motive as that\n\nsuggested by Bogosian based on the proffer of disparate-treatment\n\nevidence, the record plainly did not compel any such inference.\n\n              Further, Bogosian contends that her daughter presented\n\nunrebutted testimony that appellees advised her that it would be\n\nfutile for Bogosian to come to work, since they intended to ignore\n\nher input on corporate decisionmaking.        However, it remains within\n\nthe exclusive province of the trier of fact to determine whether\n\nunrebutted testimony is creditworthy.          See Carr, 191 F.3d at 7.\n\nThus, the district court explicitly found (i) that Bogosian's\n\ndaughter had her \"own agenda\" and (ii) that she had demonstrated on\n\nthe witness stand that she lacked credibility.          Bogosian, 167 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 500.\n\n           Next, with regard to whether appellees' commencement of\n\nthe Fall River litigation constituted a discrete breach of their\n\nfiduciary responsibilities, Bogosian urges us to set aside the\n\ndistrict court finding that appellees commenced their action in the\n\n\"good faith\" belief that Bogosian had misappropriated a corporate\n\nopportunity of WRC by purchasing the Fall River property on behalf\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fof E & J.    Id. at 500-01.    She contends that the state court found\n\nnot only that she had not breached her fiduciary duty, either to\n\nWRC   or    her   brothers,   but   that     appellees'   lawsuit     had    been\n\n\"unfounded\" (viz., frivolous, designed solely to harass and to\n\nrecover damages to offset their anticipated buy-out of her shares).\n\n             Quite the contrary, the state court simply turned away\n\nappellees' alternative contentions on appeal, either (i) that they\n\nhad adduced such compelling evidence of Bogosian's breach of her\n\nfiduciary responsibility that a reasonable factfinder was compelled\n\nto find in their favor, or (ii) that the judgment was against the\n\nclear weight of the evidence.          In its unpublished opinion, made\n\npart of the record before us, the state appellate court explicitly\n\nnoted that appellees had adduced evidence which might have been\n\ncredited by the jury, but that the jury chose instead to credit\n\nBogosian's version.      Cf., e.g., Bartlett v. John Hancock Mut. Life\n\nIns. Co., 538 A.2d 997, 1000 (R.I. 1988) (noting that \"bad faith\"\n\nwill not be inferred where party sued on debatable issue of law).\n\nThe Bogosian appeal itself, ironically, has now been hoisted on the\n\nsame petard.\n\n             Bogosian   further     faults   the   district   court    for    (i)\n\nfinding that she sustained no damages as a result of the Fall River\n\nlawsuit, and (ii) ignoring that the appellees had lodged a lis\n\npendens against the Fall River property, that three prospective\n\nbuyers thereafter decided not to purchase the property, and that\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\fstate law permits the factfinder to infer that such a cloud on\n\ntitle thwarted its sale.       See Anthony A. DeLeo v. Nunes, Inc., 546\n\nA.2d 1344, 1347-48 (R.I. 1988).         As her citation to DeLeo itself\n\nacknowledges, however, any such inference is permissive, rather\n\nthan mandatory.     Id. (\"Filing such a document without a colorable\n\nclaim is done at the filer's peril.\"). Moreover, appellees adduced\n\nample evidence that the three prospective purchasers of the Fall\n\nRiver property backed out for reasons other than the lis pendens.\n\nBogosian, 167 F. Supp. 2d at 496-97.\n\n            Bogosian points also to her brother James’s testimony\n\nthat   he   has   never    believed   that   she   stole   a   WRC   corporate\n\nopportunity by purchasing the Fall River property through E & J.\n\nShe insists that James's testimony compelled a finding that the\n\nproperty did not represent a corporate opportunity of WRC, and,\n\nconsequently, that she could not have pirated such an opportunity\n\nfrom WRC.\n\n            The    present     contention     conveniently      ignores    the\n\nrequirement that the proffered testimony is to be viewed in the\n\ncontext of the witness's other testimony:           (i) that James, unlike\n\nBogosian, had not participated in the initial decision to acquire\n\nthe property for E & J, rather than for WRC, and (ii) that James\n\nbelieved from the outset that Bogosian's decision violated her\n\nfiduciary duty to WRC and to their brother, Harry, who was not a\n\npartner in E & J.         Additionally, the district court aptly cited\n\n\n                                      -30-\n\fJames's testimony that the Fall River property acquisition was\n\nunlike E & J's other purchases, in that WRC itself had remitted the\n\noption fees to obtain the former.           Bogosian, 167 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n502.\n\n            As   the   record   on   appeal   contains   ample   supportive\n\nevidence for the district court judgment relating to counts 1 and\n\n2, there was no clear error. See Barrs, 287 F.3d at 206.11\n\n            B.    The Cross Appeal\n\n            The defendants cross-appeal from the district-court award\n\nof prejudgment interest to Bogosian under count 3, contending that\n\nit erroneously applied a 12% prejudgment interest rate.                 See\n\nBogosian, 93 F. Supp. 2d at 157-59.           In 1997, the district court\n\n(Boyle, S.D.J.) calculated the value of Bogosian's corporate shares\n\n\n\n       11\n      Bogosian also asserts that the district court erred in\ndenying her postjudgment request that the funds in the court\nregistry be disbursed to her forthwith.      She characterizes the\ndenial as a de facto stay which should have necessitated that\ndefendants post a supersedeas bond as security for their judgment\ndebt. We do not agree. First, a bond is required only where the\nplaintiff is unsecured or undersecured due to the fact that the\nentire judgment has not yet been satisfied.        Whereas WRC has\nalready overpaid its judgment debt into the court registry, and is\ndue a refund on remand. See, e.g., Corrigan Dispatch Co. v. Casa\nGuzman, S.A., 569 F.2d 300, 302-03 (5th Cir. 1978) (noting that\ndistrict court may dispense with security-bond requirement where\nentire purchase price in disputed sale has been paid into court\nregistry). Second, the district court aptly noted that the precise\namount of the disbursement due Bogosian from the court registry has\nyet to be finally determined, in light of the current WRC cross-\nappeal from the interest award, see infra Section II.B, and the\npendency of the 1993 interpleader action by Bogosian's creditors,\nwho claim entitlement to an as-yet undetermined portion of her\ncount 3 award.\n\n                                     -31-\n\fin WRC, holding that she was not liable for any of the taxes WRC\n\nincurred in selling its assets to generate the monies with which to\n\nfund the buy-out.   Bogosian, 973 F. Supp. at 106-07.     The \"minority\n\nshareholder oppression\" statute in effect at the time simply\n\nprescribed that the \"petitioner shall be entitled to interest on\n\nthe purchase price of the shares from the date of the filing of the\n\n[defendant's] election to purchase the shares.\"      R.I. Gen. Laws 7-\n\n1.1-90.1 (1998) (emphasis added). As the statute specified neither\n\nthe rate of interest nor the method for calculating it, the\n\ndistrict court conducted an evidentiary hearing at which expert\n\ntestimony was adduced as to a fair rate of return, viz., the\n\ninterest Bogosian would have been able to earn had she received and\n\nprudently invested the purchase monies in 1989. After entertaining\n\nestimates ranging from 8 to 15%, the district court settled upon\n\n11%, compounded monthly, as a reasonable rate.       Bogosian, 973 F.\n\nSupp. at 107-09.\n\n            WRC appealed, contending that (i) § 7-1.1-90.1 (1998) did\n\nnot contemplate the compounding of interest, and (ii) the choice of\n\nthe 11% rate overstated Bogosian's actual lost-investment income.\n\nThereafter, we upheld the 11% calculation, but found that § 7-1.1-\n\n90.1   prescribed   simple   interest   only,   rather   than   compound\n\ninterest.    Bogosian, 158 F.3d at 9.      Moreover, we reversed the\n\ndistrict court determination that the cross-appellee need not be\n\nheld responsible for one third of WRC's tax liabilities, then\n\n\n                                 -32-\n\fremanded for further factfinding on the latter issue.              Id. at 6-7.\n\n            On remand, the district court took tax liabilities into\n\naccount and determined that Bogosian was due roughly $4,000,000\n\nfrom defendants in recompense for her corporate shares.                Bogosian,\n\n93 F. Supp. 2d at 154.      Turning to the interest award, the district\n\ncourt noted that § 7-1.1-90.1 had been amended in July 1999 to\n\nread: \"The petitioner is entitled to interest, at the rate on\n\njudgments in civil actions, on the purchase price of the shares\n\nfrom the date of the filing of the election to purchase the\n\nshares.\"    R.I. Gen. Laws § 7-1.1-90.1 (1999) (emphasis added).              As\n\nthe Rhode Island statute prescribes a 12% prejudgment interest rate\n\nin civil cases, see R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-21-10 (1997), and the\n\nversion of § 9-21-10 in effect at the entry of judgment controlled\n\nthe interest rate, the district court boosted the interest award\n\nagainst defendants to 12% simple interest, Bogosian, 93 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 155-56, for a total interest award on count 3 approximating $3.8\n\nmillion, id. at 158.       In October 2001, following a bench trial on\n\ncounts 1 and 2, the district court entered final judgment on the\n\nBogosian complaint, which incorporated its April 2000 decision\n\nawarding prejudgment interest.\n\n            On appeal from the final judgment the defendants assert\n\ntwo challenges to the 12% interest award.                  First, defendants\n\ncontend that the amended version of § 7-1.1-90.1, with its addition\n\nof   the   phrase   \"at   the   rate   on     judgments   in   civil   actions,\"\n\n\n                                       -33-\n\funambiguously expresses a legislative intendment to import the\n\npostjudgment interest rate, rather than the prejudgment interest\n\nrate. Their contention is predicated on the fact that, under Rhode\n\nIsland law, the term \"judgment\" refers to the final judgment.\n\n           We review interpretations of state statutes de novo. See\n\nManchester Sch. Dist. v. Crisman, 305 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nAbsent state-court case law on point, wherever practicable we\n\nundertake a fair prediction as to the course the highest state\n\ncourt would take were it presented with the same legal issue.               See\n\nNieves v. Univ. of P.R., 7 F.3d 270, 274-75 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           We are unable to discern how the mere fact that the term\n\n\"judgment\" denotes \"final judgment\" aids in the interpretation of\n\nthe pivotal phrase \"on judgments.\"         That is to say, it is by no\n\nmeans clear that prejudgment interest is any less a form of\n\ninterest \"on\" a final judgment than is postjudgment interest.\n\nUnder   section   7-1.1-90.1,   interest    on    the    purchase   price   of\n\ncorporate shares is explicitly required to be measured \"from the\n\ndate of the filing of the election to purchase the shares,\" and,\n\npresumably, continues until the entry of final judgment, at which\n\ntime the stock purchase is deemed to have occurred.            Consequently,\n\nthe legislature reasonably may have anticipated that prejudgment\n\ninterest would be considered interest \"on\" — viz., measured in\n\nreference to, then added \"on\" to — a [final] judgment.\n\n           Common   sense   suggests   that      since   the   pre-amendment\n\n\n                                  -34-\n\fversion of § 7-1.1-90.1 was somewhat ambiguous as regards the\n\nprecise means to be used to calculate \"interest,\" the legislative\n\namendment simply sought to clarify the matter by explicitly tying\n\nthe § 7-1.1-90.1 interest rate to the interest rate specified in §\n\n9-21-10.   See, e.g., Liquilux Gas Corp. v. Martin Gas Sales, 979\n\nF.2d 887, 890 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"Rather, we hold that the amendment\n\nwas not a change at all, but a clarification that did not alter the\n\nlaw, and merely explicated it. Clarification, effective ab initio,\n\nis a well recognized principle.          Determination of whether new\n\nlegislative action is alteration, or merely clarification, may\n\ndepend on a number of factors.     One may be the fit in language.   A\n\nsignificant one is the fact that the new enactment clarifies an\n\nambiguity.\").   Moreover,   the    plausibility   of   the   postulated\n\ninterpretation may be readily demonstrated simply by comparing the\n\nrelative ease with which the district court determined the interest\n\nrate in arriving at its post-remand decision in 2000, with the\n\nexhaustive factfinding it had been required to undertake in its\n\npre-remand decision in 1998.      Compare Bogosian, 93 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n155-56, with Bogosian, 973 F. Supp. at 107-12.\n\n           The defendants argue, in the alternative, that the pre-\n\namendment version of § 7-1.1-90.1 should apply because (i) most of\n\ntheir payments into the court registry were made prior to the\n\nlegislative amendment, (ii) the accrual of interest on the registry\n\nfunds was stayed by the district court prior to the amendment, and\n\n\n                                  -35-\n\f(iii) this court previously had affirmed the \"final\" determination\n\nof the 11% award in Bogosian v. Woloohojian Realty Corp., 158 F.3d\n\n1, 9 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          First, we note that the defendants did not raise their\n\nalternative argument prior to the entry of the final judgment in\n\nOctober 2001, electing instead to submit a postjudgment motion to\n\nalter and amend the judgment.    As the district court noted in its\n\nearlier interlocutory decision relating to count 3 in April 2000,\n\n\"[b]oth parties agree[d] that the amended statute applies in the\n\ncase at bar.\"   Bogosian, 93 F. Supp. 2d at 155 (quoting Zawatsky v.\n\nCohen, 463 A.2d 210, 213 (R.I. 1983) (\"[T]he interest on a judgment\n\nis determined in accordance with the statute in effect at the time\n\nof its rendition rather than at the time the action accrued.\")).\n\n\"[A] motion under Rule 59(e) [to alter and amend a judgment] is not\n\nappropriately used to present new issues or evidence: 'Rule 59(e)\n\nmotions are aimed at reconsideration, not initial consideration.\n\nThus, parties should not use them to raise arguments which could,\n\nand should, have been made before judgment issued.    Motions under\n\nRule 59(e) must either clearly establish a manifest error of law or\n\nmust present newly discovered evidence. They may not be used to\n\nargue a new legal theory.'\"   Jorge Rivera Sirillo & Co. v. Falconer\n\nGlass Indus., Inc., 37 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 1994) (citation\n\nomitted) (emphasis added).      Given the heightened standard of\n\nreview, we conclude that the defendants have failed to demonstrate\n\n\n                                -36-\n\fa manifest error of law in the 12% interest award.\n\n            First, the present circumstances — that, prior to 1999,\n\ndefendants paid the bulk of the funds into the court registry and\n\nthe district court halted the accrual of interest — do not give\n\nrise to a manifest inequity.              \"Statutes that award prejudgment\n\ninterest generally serve the dual purposes of encouraging the early\n\nsettlement of claims, and compensating plaintiffs for waiting for\n\nrecompense    to   which   they    were    legally   entitled.\"    Martin v.\n\nLumbermen's Mut. Cas. Co., 559 A.2d 1028, 1031 (R.I. 1989).           On two\n\nseparate    occasions,     the    district   court   explicitly   found   that\n\nBogosian was not responsible for the delay in calculating the value\n\nof her shares under count 3.         See, e.g., Bogosian, 93 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 155 (noting that \"[t]he issues involved in valuating [WRC] have\n\nbeen complex\").     Consequently, we discern no equitable basis for\n\ndenying Bogosian the benefit of the fortuity that § 7-1.1-90.1 was\n\namended before the \"final,\" albeit partial, judgment on count 3 was\n\nentered in April 2000.\n\n             The decision entered by the district court in 1999,\n\nsuspending the accrual of interest on the registry funds, is\n\nunavailing to the defendants as well.                Bogosian agreed to the\n\ncessation as a precondition to the allowance, by the district\n\ncourt, of her motions for a continuance of the trial on counts 1\n\nand 2.     The defendants thus received considerable protection from\n\n\n\n\n                                      -37-\n\fany delay attributable to those continuances.12             Yet the defendants\n\ndid not request that the district court freeze the rate of interest\n\nat   11%    as   well,   which   would    have   provided    them   additional\n\nprotection against intervening statutory amendments. Consequently,\n\nalthough the cross-appellee waived her right to post-1999 accruals\n\nof additional interest, she did not waive her right to the \"rate-\n\nat-time-of-judgment\" rule prescribed in Zawatsky v. Cohen, 463 A.2d\n\n210, 213 (R.I. 1983).\n\n             Finally, our affirmance of the 11% rate in the earlier\n\nappeal, Bogosian v. Woloohojian Realty Corp., 158 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.\n\n2000), is immaterial, as it predated enactment of the amendment to\n\n§ 7-1.1-90.1. Based on the pre-amendment statute, the 11% interest\n\ncalculation was appropriate, in that it was founded on district\n\ncourt      factfinding   which   was     not   clearly   erroneous,    and   we\n\n\n\n      12\n      Ironically, were it not for the 1999 district court decision\nto cease interest accruals, the defendants' interpretation of the\namended § 7-1.1-90.1 would seem to have required that prejudgment\ninterest be measured up to the entry of the final judgment on\ncounts 1, 2 and 3 in October 2001, rather than up to the entry of\nthe partial \"final\" judgment on count 3 in April 2000.       As we\nvacated the interest award on different grounds (viz., compounding\nof interest), in Bogosian v. Woloohojian Realty Corp., 158 F.3d 1\n(1st Cir. 2000), there was no final \"judgment\" within the meaning\nof § 7-1.1-90.1. \"[T]he term 'judgment' referred to in § 9-21-10\ncontemplates a final judgment, one that finally adjudicates the\nrights of the parties, whether it is a judgment from which no\nappeal is taken or a judgment that is affirmed by this court after\nconsideration and rejection of the appellant's contentions.\" Welsh\nMfg., Div. of Textron, Inc. v. Pinkerton's Inc., 494 A.2d 897, 898\n(R.I. 1985). The attendant irony is reminiscent of the \"old saw\"\nthat the only thing worse than unanswered prayers are answered\nones.\n\n                                       -38-\n\fspecifically noted, at the time, that § 9-21-10 did not establish\n\nthe interest rate for § 7-1.1-90.1.        See id. at 8.   Even if we were\n\nto construe our prior holding as the law of the case, intervening\n\nchanges in the substantive law are legitimate grounds upon which to\n\nrevisit the issue in subsequent proceedings.            See JOM, Inc. v.\n\nAdell     Plastics,   Inc.,   193   F.3d    47,   52   (1st   Cir.   1999).\n\nAccordingly, we deny the cross appeal and affirm the buy-out price\n\nas calculated by the district court under count 3.13\n\n            Affirmed. The parties shall bear their own costs.            So\n\nordered.\n\n\n\n\n     13\n      As occurs all too frequently in cases of such magnitude and\nanimosity, appellants presented a plethora of arguments on appeal\nso utterly lacking in merit as to warrant no mention. Accordingly,\nall such arguments are categorically rejected.\n\n                                    -39-\n\f",

While still working at WRC, James and Bogosian formed a\n\nseparate real estate company, E & J Realty (E & J), from which\n\nHarry was excluded.\n\n             In 1981, Bogosian acquired an option to purchase real\n\nestate in Fall River, Massachusetts (\"Fall River property\") in the\n\nname of \"Taunton River Enterprises.\"          For more than two years, WRC\n\nremitted fees and $3,000 monthly to maintain her purchase-option\n\ncontract.       The record is silent         as to whether WRC was ever\n\nreimbursed by Bogosian.         Be that as it may and unbeknownst to\n\nJames, Bogosian exercised the purchase option in 1984, in the name\n\nof E & J, rather than WRC, thereby effectively excluding Harry\n\nWoloohojian from the deal.          Subsequently, when Harry confronted\n\nJames regarding Bogosian's acquisition of the Fall River property\n\nthrough E & J, James assured Harry that he regarded the property as\n\nan asset of WRC, rather than E & J, then promised to help Harry\n\nregain title to the property on behalf of WRC.              By 1986, James and\n\nHarry, having become fully reconciled, voted to install James in\n\nplace   of    Bogosian   as   the   WRC   president.        Although    Bogosian\n\nimmediately     ceased   to    perform      any   further    services    as   an\n\nofficer/employee, she continued to draw her full salary from WRC.\n\n             In 1987, James, Harry, and WRC instituted a civil action\n\nin the Massachusetts courts against Bogosian and E & J (\"Fall River\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\flitigation\"), claiming that the decision by Bogosian to acquire the\n\nFall River real estate in the name of E & J constituted a wrongful\n\nusurpation of a corporate opportunity belonging to WRC.                     The\n\ncomplaint demanded      that   title   to   the   Fall   River   property    be\n\nconveyed to WRC, which resulted in a lis pendens against the\n\nproperty.      Meanwhile,   Bogosian    had   received    three    offers   to\n\npurchase the Fall River property, ranging from five to eleven\n\nmillion dollars. These offers were never consummated, however, for\n\nreasons unrelated to the lis pendens.\n\n             In 1988-89, James Woloohojian, in his capacity as the\n\npresident of WRC, fired Bogosian and her children.                Thereafter,\n\nBogosian brought the instant diversity action in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Rhode Island.              The three-count\n\namended complaint alleged that WRC, as well as James and Harry\n\nWoloohojian,     had   breached,   and/or    conspired   to    breach,   their\n\nfiduciary duties to her by \"freezing her out\" of her positions as\n\npresident, minority shareholder, and employee of WRC, and demanded\n\nthe dissolution of WRC (count 3).2          In order to avoid a corporate\n\n\n     2\n         R.

Gen. Laws § 7-1.1-\n\n90.1.3 Subsequently, the district court directed the defendants to\n\ncommence making payments into the court registry.                   The defendants\n\nresponded with a counterclaim asserting that Bogosian had converted\n\nother WRC funds to her personal use as well.\n\n              In   1992,    the        Fall   River     litigation    pending    in\n\nMassachusetts state court was terminated following a jury finding\n\nthat Bogosian had not usurped a WRC corporate opportunity.\n\n              In 1993, after Bogosian's many creditors asserted claims\n\nto the monies previously deposited in the court registry by WRC,\n\nWRC   responded     with    an    interpleader        action.   Thereafter,      the\n\ndistrict court directed an administrative consolidation of the\n\ninterpleader       action   with       the    pending    proceeding    brought    by\n\n\n              corporation        are    illegal,      oppressive,     or\n              fraudulent.\n      3\n          Section 7-1.1-90.1 provides, in pertinent part:\n\n              Whenever a petition for dissolution of a\n              corporation   is    filed  by  one  or   more\n              shareholders . . . pursuant to either §\n              7-1.1-90 or a right to compel dissolution\n              which is authorized under § 7-1.1-51 or is\n              otherwise valid, one or more of its other\n              shareholders may avoid the dissolution by\n              filing   with    the   court  prior  to   the\n              commencement of the hearing, or, in the\n              discretion of the court, at any time prior to\n              a sale or other disposition of the assets of\n              the corporation, an election to purchase the\n              shares owned by the petitioner at a price\n              equal to their fair value.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fBogosian.\n\n            In 1997, the district court (Boyle, S.D.J.) entered a\n\nfinal decision as to count 3, establishing a fair value for the\n\nshare buy-out.

The district court conditioned its grant of the\n\nfurther continuances, however, by directing that no additional\n\ninterest was to accrue on the count 3 fund held in the court\n\nregistry.\n\n            Following the eventual bench trial, the district court\n\nruled for the defendants on both counts 1 and 2.

P. 38; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 39(b)\n\n(\"Issues not demanded for trial by jury as provided in Rule 38\n\nshall be tried by the court.\").            We conclude that the district\n\ncourt did not err.4\n\n           First, although Bogosian acknowledges that no jury-trial\n\ndemand was made in the amended complaint as to counts 1 and 2, and\n\nthat the defendants made no such demand in their answer, Bogosian's\n\nreply to their answer did demand a jury trial on defendants'\n\ncounterclaim. The counterclaim alleged that Bogosian had converted\n\nWRC funds to her personal use.        Bogosian contends that the issues\n\nat the heart of both her claims, as well as the counterclaim, were\n\n     4\n      We note that Bogosian has simply assumed that she is entitled\nto a jury trial under § 7-1.1-90, notwithstanding that a claim of\n\"breach of fiduciary duty\" has long been recognized as an equitable\ncause of action, to which no right to jury trial attaches.

Thus,\n\nChamplin neither implicated the right to jury trial, nor in any\n\nsense remotely        suggested     that    the    right      to   jury    trial,    once\n\naffirmatively waived, must be restored due simply to the fact that\n\nthe opposing party in the litigation happens to have alleged a so-\n\ncalled \"interwoven\" counterclaim.\n\n             The Bogosian complaint and the appellees' counterclaim\n\nwere not \"interwoven,\" however, at least as concerns the right to\n\njury trial.        In counts 1 and 2 of the amended complaint, Bogosian\n\nalleged that appellees had breached their fiduciary duty to her as\n\na minority shareholder, by, inter alia, initiating the vexatious\n\nFall River litigation in which the appellees alleged that she had\n\nbreached     her    fiduciary      duty    to    WRC    by    usurping     a    corporate\n\nopportunity.          Bogosian      incorrectly         asserts     on    appeal     that\n\nappellees'     counterclaim         \"complained        that    [she]      breached    her\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\ffiduciary duty [to WRC] when she purchased options on the property\n\nin Fall River.\" (Emphasis added.)           Instead, in their counterclaim\n\nthe   appellees   merely   alleged    that    Bogosian   had   utilized   her\n\nofficial position in WRC to retain legal counsel to handle her own\n\n— as distinguished from corporate — legal matters, including the\n\nFall River litigation.\n\n            Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38(b) permits a party to\n\n\"demand a trial by jury of any issue triable of right by a jury,\"\n\nprovided the jury-trial demand is served within ten days \"after the\n\nservice of the last pleading directed to such issue.\"           Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 38(b).    Bogosian contends, in effect, that she was entitled to\n\na jury trial on counts 1 and 2 simply on the basis that her\n\ncomplaint and appellants' counterclaim arose from a common factual\n\nsetting, viz., the Fall River property litigation.             The right to\n\njury trial depends not upon the factual setting from which the\n\nclaim arose, however, but (i) upon whether the claim involves an\n\nissue \"triable of right by a jury,\" and (ii) upon the nature of the\n\ncause of action as well as its historical treatment in English-\n\nAmerican jurisprudence (viz., whether the proceedings are more\n\nemblematic of a \"legal\" proceeding, as distinguished from an\n\n\"equitable\" one).

Cir. 1997). Had\n\nthese appellees initially tried their counterclaim before a jury,\n\nthe lone pertinent factual element would have been whether the Fall\n\nRiver litigation related to Bogosian's personal business, such that\n\nshe would have been in breach of her fiduciary duty to WRC by\n\nhaving converted its funds for the purposes of retaining counsel to\n\nhandle her own case.     In contrast, Bogosian could prevail on her\n\nequitable claims in counts 1 and 2 only by demonstrating that the\n\nappellees had acted in bad faith by initiating the litigation\n\nrelating to the Fall River property — a finding neither essential\n\nto, nor an element of, their counterclaim for conversion.\n\n            Next, Bogosian asserts that she relied upon an inaccurate\n\ndocket entry by the clerk's office, which mistakenly stated:\n\n\"Defendant made a demand for a jury.\"             Yet Bogosian neither\n\nprovides a citation to the record on appeal, nor can we glean any\n\nsuch docket entry from the record on appeal, see Fed. R. App. P. 28\n\n(requiring that appellant cite to record as to each salient fact).\n\nMoreover,   not   only   was   she   a   \"defendant\"   as   to   appellees'\n\ncounterclaim, but even if any such docket entry did advert to the\n\nappellees in the singular (i.e., \"Defendant\"), Bogosian cites no\n\nauthority for the suggestion that reliance on an obvious clerical\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\ferror suffices to resurrect a right to jury trial previously\n\nwaived.\n\n             Lastly, Bogosian maintains that she opposed the district\n\ncourt ruling rejecting her motion to continue by asserting that the\n\nscheduling of counts 1 & 2 for bench trial abrogated her Seventh\n\nAmendment right to jury trial.         The present contention is patently\n\nflawed in at least two respects:         (i) her cursory objection failed\n\nto detail the nature of any putative error; and (ii) without more,\n\nno such belated objection can serve to resurrect a jury-trial right\n\nlong since waived.         See Fed. R. Civ. P. 38(d) (\"The failure of a\n\nparty   to   serve   and    file   a   demand   as   required   by   this   rule\n\nconstitutes a waiver by the party of trial by jury.\") (emphasis\n\nadded); Fed. R. Civ. P. 39(b) (noting that party who fails to make\n\ntimely request for jury trial may avoid waiver and secure a jury\n\ntrial only if the district court, in its discretion, acts favorably\n\non such a request).\n\n             Accordingly, we affirm the district court ruling that\n\nBogosian waived any right to trial by jury in relation to counts 1\n\n& 2.\n\n       2.    The Motions for Continuance\n             Relating to Counts 1 and 2\n\n             Next, Bogosian maintains that the district court erred in\n\ndenying her motions to postpone the bench trial due to her life-\n\nthreatening illness.

Her motions were also predicated\n\nupon     her    recent   retention   of    new   counsel,   the   ninth   such\n\nsubstitution of counsel since she initiated her lawsuit.                  Even\n\nassuming       some   adequate   justification    for   Bogosian's   numerous\n\nreplacements of trial counsel, the attendant further delays plainly\n\nafforded additional legitimate grounds for the district court to\n\ncontinue to seek, wherever practicable, a fair and expeditious\n\ndisposition of the case.

Plainly, such a representation\n\nby counsel strongly implied that other members of Bogosian's family\n\nwere       available       and   competent    to    assist    counsel     with   further\n\npretrial preparations.\n\n                  Fourth,        Bogosian's         protestations         on      appeal\n\nnotwithstanding, the district court granted her July 2000 motion to\n\ncontinue, thereby authorizing the requested 190-day extension,\n\nwhereupon the anticipated trial date was postponed to late March\n\n2001.        Moreover, the district court subsequently allowed yet\n\nanother motion for continuance, further postponing the trial to May\n\n8, 2001.\n\n                  Fifth,     Bogosian        submitted        no    updated      medical\n\ndocumentation that she remained unfit to testify at trial in May\n\n2001, even though her oncologist had represented in a November 3,\n\n2000, letter that her treatment would \"finish in late January\n\n[2001],\" and that he anticipated \"a month or so of post-treatment\n\nrecovery.\"5          Moreover, in a January 2001 follow-up letter, the\n\noncologist         reiterated      that   his      estimate    of   the   \"anticipated\n\nrecovery time for Ms. Bogosian from all her treatment would not be\n\nuntil the end of February of this year 2001.\"                       The January 2001\n\nletter was the final pretrial communication from her medical\n\n\n       5\n      The only medical evidence Bogosian presented consisted of\nletters from her doctor to her lawyer.   She adduced no medical\nrecords or affidavits whatsoever.\n\n                                             -17-\n\fprofessionals regarding when she would be able to testify at\n\ntrial.6   As the district court observed at trial, Bogosian \"still\n\nhas not shown she is incapable of testifying in open court.

I\n\nsee no doctor's certificate.\"\n\n           Moreover, the district court later allowed Bogosian's\n\ndeposition testimony to be admitted at trial.       Finally, Bogosian\n\nhas made no contention on appeal (let alone any showing) that her\n\ndeposition testimony was inherently inferior, in any respect, to\n\nher anticipated live testimony.

One year later, as\n\ndirected on remand, see Bogosian, 158 F.3d at 9, the district court\n\nscheduled an evidentiary hearing to determine Bogosian's one-third\n\nportion of the tax liability which WRC incurred upon the sale of\n\ncertain corporate properties in order to generate the funds with\n\nwhich    to   acquire   her   WRC   shares,   pursuant   to   WRC's   count   3\n\nstatutory election.\n\n              The day before the scheduled hearing, Bogosian submitted\n\na motion to continue, citing a further need to extract and evaluate\n\nthe newly-discovered CD-ROM documents. She contended that at least\n\none of the extracted CD-ROM documents suggested that (i) WRC had\n\ncommitted fraud on the court at the pre-remand hearing regarding\n\ncount 3, during which the district court placed a valuation on the\n\nWRC assets and cash flow; (ii) a portion of the sales proceeds from\n\none piece of property was diverted covertly by WRC to other\n\ncorporate purposes; and (iii) WRC overstated, by one hundred\n\npercent, the capital gains it realized from the sale.\n\n\nillness and her former counsel's withdrawal) thwarted her discovery\nefforts.

Furthermore, when the district court proposed to\n\nsuspend the accrual of interest on the count 3 fund, Bogosian's\n\ncounsel expressed ready agreement.\n\n            Thereafter, at a hearing held on April 28, Bogosian's\n\ncounsel requested yet another thirty-day continuance within which\n\nto depose WRC's controller concerning the previously-discussed land\n\nsale, stating emphatically:            \"After 30 days is up, that's it, we\n\nare ready for trial,\" and \"[a]ll I am asking for is 30 days, and to\n\nget on with this trial.\"\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\f           On the ample basis of these representations, the district\n\ncourt granted the requested continuance for the limited purpose of\n\ndeposing the WRC controller.\n\n           At a hearing on July 30, however, Bogosian requested yet\n\nanother round of discovery — even though she had yet to depose the\n\nWRC controller — contending that (i) the CD-ROM documents had\n\ndemonstrated that the WRC had a much larger monthly cash flow in\n\n1996 than the $9,500 previously represented to the court, (ii) \"we\n\n. . . can envision a situation . . . where WRC was being used as a\n\nprivate cookie jar” [i.e., improperly and surreptiously to syphon\n\noff cash to its shareholders], (iii) WRC's so-called compulsion to\n\nsell its assets in order to buy out her shares probably was a ruse,\n\nand (iv) accordingly, Bogosian should not be held accountable for\n\nher one-third share of the tax liability associated with the sale\n\nof those shares.\n\n           The choice of the term \"envision\" by Bogosian's counsel\n\nwas telling indeed. Pressed by the court, counsel admitted that he\n\nhad no \"basis for claiming [that WRC did not have to sell the\n\nproperties],\" but that additional discovery might disclose cash\n\ndiversions by insiders.           Then and there, the district court made\n\nclear   that   it   would   not    permit       additional   discovery,     unless\n\n\"there's really newly discovered evidence here,\" and that Bogosian\n\nhad   submitted     no   motion    for    new    trial   \"showing   [any]    newly\n\ndiscovered evidence.\" Accordingly, the court denied the motion for\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\fadditional    discovery,      then    \"seriously\"    took    under   advisement\n\nappellees' motion for sanctions.\n\n            Given the exceptionally sorry travel of this case, the\n\ninstant contention can only be deemed utterly frivolous.                Far from\n\nabusing its discretion, the district court proceeded to allow the\n\ncontinuances requested by Bogosian's counsel to study the CD-ROM\n\ndocuments    and    conduct    limited      depositions.       Thereafter,    it\n\nreasonably drew the line when Bogosian acknowledged that she had no\n\nnewly-discovered     evidence        warranting   further     discovery.

We\n\ndiscern no abuse of discretion whatsoever by the district court.\n\n            As evidence of her apparent intent to harass the defense,\n\nwe note that Bogosian (i) served the subpoena the day before trial,\n\nwithout the slightest attempt to explain why she had failed to\n\ndepose opposing counsel during the preceding ten-year period of\n\nongoing discovery, (ii) requested that Mr. Grimm produce eighteen\n\nbroadly-described categories of corporate documents spanning more\n\nthan two decades (i.e., since 1980), (iii) made no showing that she\n\nwas unable to obtain the evidence from other sources, particularly\n\nWRC, their rightful owner, (iv) requested that Mr. Grimm testify at\n\ntrial solely to the \"existence[] or ... authenticity\" of the two\n\ndocuments, testimony she obviously could have obtained from any\n\nnumber of witnesses other than Mr. Grimm, (v) sought testimony from\n\nMr. Grimm which was marginally relevant at most, in that the two\n\ndocuments postdated the \"freeze-out.\"        Finally, the testimony\n\nsought from Mr. Grimm — in all likelihood and for the most part —\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fwould have been cumulative, since Bogosian herself adduced other\n\nevidence that her brothers had \"frozen her out\" in order to conceal\n\nfrom her their alleged corporate shenanigans.\n\n            Accordingly and for the foregoing reasons, the district\n\ncourt ruling quashing the subpoena must be affirmed.\n\n            b)   The Adverse Inference Sought Based On the\n                 Failure of Certain Defendants to Appear at Trial\n\n            Bogosian next contends that the district court erred in\n\ndeclining to infer — from the failure of defendants James and Z.\n\nElaine Woloohojian to appear at trial — that their testimony would\n\nhave been adverse to the defense.

Bogosian, 167 F. Supp. 2d at 503 (\"This court\n\ncredits the testimony of James and Harry.\").                        Undaunted, Bogosian\n\nincorrectly      asserts        on   appeal     that    her      late    brother,       Harry,\n\nprovided unrebutted deposition testimony that the actual basis for\n\nher termination had been that she sought to audit the corporate\n\nbooks.    Instead, Harry simply attested to the fact that Bogosian\n\nhad requested the audit and questioned the defendants' motives.\n\nHarry    did    not       state,     however,    that       this     was    what       prompted\n\nBogosian's discharge.\n\n               Thus,      the   mere    description         of     Bogosian's          requests\n\ncertainly did not compel the district court to determine, as a\n\nfact, either that her audit requests were justified or that she was\n\nfired by her brothers in order to prevent her revelation of their\n\nimproper business practices.                 Indeed, Bogosian has never adduced\n\nany corroborative evidence whatsoever in regard to her allegations.\n\n               Instead,      Bogosian       simply     maintains        that     she    adduced\n\nevidence that Harry was not terminated by WRC in the early 1980's\n\nfor failure          to   perform     his   corporate       duties,        and   that     WRC's\n\ndisparate treatment of her belies appellees' purportedly legitimate\n\n\n                                             -27-\n\fbasis   for    terminating   her.      The   district   court   reasonably\n\ndetermined, however, that Bogosian was well aware — regardless\n\nwhether Harry should have been fired earlier — that she was\n\nknowingly inviting termination by her refusal to perform her own\n\ncorporate responsibilities.         Thus, although a rational factfinder\n\nconceivably may have inferred some such nefarious motive as that\n\nsuggested by Bogosian based on the proffer of disparate-treatment\n\nevidence, the record plainly did not compel any such inference.\n\n              Further, Bogosian contends that her daughter presented\n\nunrebutted testimony that appellees advised her that it would be\n\nfutile for Bogosian to come to work, since they intended to ignore\n\nher input on corporate decisionmaking.        However, it remains within\n\nthe exclusive province of the trier of fact to determine whether\n\nunrebutted testimony is creditworthy.          See Carr, 191 F.3d at 7.\n\nThus, the district court explicitly found (i) that Bogosian's\n\ndaughter had her \"own agenda\" and (ii) that she had demonstrated on\n\nthe witness stand that she lacked credibility.          Bogosian, 167 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 500.\n\n           Next, with regard to whether appellees' commencement of\n\nthe Fall River litigation constituted a discrete breach of their\n\nfiduciary responsibilities, Bogosian urges us to set aside the\n\ndistrict court finding that appellees commenced their action in the\n\n\"good faith\" belief that Bogosian had misappropriated a corporate\n\nopportunity of WRC by purchasing the Fall River property on behalf\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fof E & J.

In its unpublished opinion, made\n\npart of the record before us, the state appellate court explicitly\n\nnoted that appellees had adduced evidence which might have been\n\ncredited by the jury, but that the jury chose instead to credit\n\nBogosian's version.

Bogosian, 167 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n502.\n\n            As   the   record   on   appeal   contains   ample   supportive\n\nevidence for the district court judgment relating to counts 1 and\n\n2, there was no clear error.

She characterizes the\ndenial as a de facto stay which should have necessitated that\ndefendants post a supersedeas bond as security for their judgment\ndebt. We do not agree. First, a bond is required only where the\nplaintiff is unsecured or undersecured due to the fact that the\nentire judgment has not yet been satisfied.        Whereas WRC has\nalready overpaid its judgment debt into the court registry, and is\ndue a refund on remand. See, e.g., Corrigan Dispatch Co. v. Casa\nGuzman, S.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"352498\"><a href=\"/opinion/352498/corrigan-dispatch-company-v-casa-guzman-s-a-cargill-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 302-03 (5th Cir. 1978) (noting that\ndistrict court may dispense with security-bond requirement where\nentire purchase price in disputed sale has been paid into court\nregistry). Second, the district court aptly noted that the precise\namount of the disbursement due Bogosian from the court registry has\nyet to be finally determined, in light of the current WRC cross-\nappeal from the interest award, see infra Section II.B, and the\npendency of the 1993 interpleader action by Bogosian's creditors,\nwho claim entitlement to an as-yet undetermined portion of her\ncount 3 award.\n\n                                     -31-\n\fin WRC, holding that she was not liable for any of the taxes WRC\n\nincurred in selling its assets to generate the monies with which to\n\nfund the buy-out.   Bogosian, 973 F. Supp. at 106-07.     The \"minority\n\nshareholder oppression\" statute in effect at the time simply\n\nprescribed that the \"petitioner shall be entitled to interest on\n\nthe purchase price of the shares from the date of the filing of the\n\n[defendant's] election to purchase the shares.\"      R.I. Gen. Laws 7-\n\n1.1-90.1 (1998) (emphasis added). As the statute specified neither\n\nthe rate of interest nor the method for calculating it, the\n\ndistrict court conducted an evidentiary hearing at which expert\n\ntestimony was adduced as to a fair rate of return, viz., the\n\ninterest Bogosian would have been able to earn had she received and\n\nprudently invested the purchase monies in 1989. After entertaining\n\nestimates ranging from 8 to 15%, the district court settled upon\n\n11%, compounded monthly, as a reasonable rate.       Bogosian, 973 F.\n\nSupp. at 107-09.\n\n            WRC appealed, contending that (i) § 7-1.1-90.1 (1998) did\n\nnot contemplate the compounding of interest, and (ii) the choice of\n\nthe 11% rate overstated Bogosian's actual lost-investment income.\n\nThereafter, we upheld the 11% calculation, but found that § 7-1.1-\n\n90.1   prescribed   simple   interest   only,   rather   than   compound\n\ninterest.    Bogosian, 158 F.3d at 9.      Moreover, we reversed the\n\ndistrict court determination that the cross-appellee need not be\n\nheld responsible for one third of WRC's tax liabilities, then\n\n\n                                 -32-\n\fremanded for further factfinding on the latter issue.              Id. at 6-7.\n\n            On remand, the district court took tax liabilities into\n\naccount and determined that Bogosian was due roughly $4,000,000\n\nfrom defendants in recompense for her corporate shares.                Bogosian,\n\n93 F. Supp. 2d at 154.      Turning to the interest award, the district\n\ncourt noted that § 7-1.1-90.1 had been amended in July 1999 to\n\nread: \"The petitioner is entitled to interest, at the rate on\n\njudgments in civil actions, on the purchase price of the shares\n\nfrom the date of the filing of the election to purchase the\n\nshares.\"    R.I. Gen. Laws § 7-1.1-90.1 (1999) (emphasis added).              As\n\nthe Rhode Island statute prescribes a 12% prejudgment interest rate\n\nin civil cases, see R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-21-10 (1997), and the\n\nversion of § 9-21-10 in effect at the entry of judgment controlled\n\nthe interest rate, the district court boosted the interest award\n\nagainst defendants to 12% simple interest, Bogosian, 93 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 155-56, for a total interest award on count 3 approximating $3.8\n\nmillion, id. at 158.       In October 2001, following a bench trial on\n\ncounts 1 and 2, the district court entered final judgment on the\n\nBogosian complaint, which incorporated its April 2000 decision\n\nawarding prejudgment interest.\n\n            On appeal from the final judgment the defendants assert\n\ntwo challenges to the 12% interest award.                  First, defendants\n\ncontend that the amended version of § 7-1.1-90.1, with its addition\n\nof   the   phrase   \"at   the   rate   on     judgments   in   civil   actions,\"\n\n\n                                       -33-\n\funambiguously expresses a legislative intendment to import the\n\npostjudgment interest rate, rather than the prejudgment interest\n\nrate. Their contention is predicated on the fact that, under Rhode\n\nIsland law, the term \"judgment\" refers to the final judgment.\n\n           We review interpretations of state statutes de novo. See\n\nManchester Sch. Dist. v. Crisman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200124\"><a href=\"/opinion/200124/cape-ann-investors-v-lepone/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nAbsent state-court case law on point, wherever practicable we\n\nundertake a fair prediction as to the course the highest state\n\ncourt would take were it presented with the same legal issue.

Consequently,\n\nthe legislature reasonably may have anticipated that prejudgment\n\ninterest would be considered interest \"on\" — viz., measured in\n\nreference to, then added \"on\" to — a [final] judgment.\n\n           Common   sense   suggests   that      since   the   pre-amendment\n\n\n                                  -34-\n\fversion of § 7-1.1-90.1 was somewhat ambiguous as regards the\n\nprecise means to be used to calculate \"interest,\" the legislative\n\namendment simply sought to clarify the matter by explicitly tying\n\nthe § 7-1.1-90.1 interest rate to the interest rate specified in §\n\n9-21-10.   See, e.g., Liquilux Gas Corp. v. Martin Gas Sales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595181\"><a href=\"/opinion/595181/liquilux-gas-corporation-v-martin-gas-sales/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">887</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 890 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"Rather, we hold that the amendment\n\nwas not a change at all, but a clarification that did not alter the\n\nlaw, and merely explicated it. Clarification, effective ab initio,\n\nis a well recognized principle.          Determination of whether new\n\nlegislative action is alteration, or merely clarification, may\n\ndepend on a number of factors.     One may be the fit in language.   A\n\nsignificant one is the fact that the new enactment clarifies an\n\nambiguity.\").   Moreover,   the    plausibility   of   the   postulated\n\ninterpretation may be readily demonstrated simply by comparing the\n\nrelative ease with which the district court determined the interest\n\nrate in arriving at its post-remand decision in 2000, with the\n\nexhaustive factfinding it had been required to undertake in its\n\npre-remand decision in 1998.

On two\n\nseparate    occasions,     the    district   court   explicitly   found   that\n\nBogosian was not responsible for the delay in calculating the value\n\nof her shares under count 3.         See, e.g., Bogosian, 93 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 155 (noting that \"[t]he issues involved in valuating [WRC] have\n\nbeen complex\").     Consequently, we discern no equitable basis for\n\ndenying Bogosian the benefit of the fortuity that § 7-1.1-90.1 was\n\namended before the \"final,\" albeit partial, judgment on count 3 was\n\nentered in April 2000.\n\n             The decision entered by the district court in 1999,\n\nsuspending the accrual of interest on the registry funds, is\n\nunavailing to the defendants as well.                Bogosian agreed to the\n\ncessation as a precondition to the allowance, by the district\n\ncourt, of her motions for a continuance of the trial on counts 1\n\nand 2.     The defendants thus received considerable protection from\n\n\n\n\n                                      -37-\n\fany delay attributable to those continuances.12             Yet the defendants\n\ndid not request that the district court freeze the rate of interest\n\nat   11%    as   well,   which   would    have   provided    them   additional\n\nprotection against intervening statutory amendments.
