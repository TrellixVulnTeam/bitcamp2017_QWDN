Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil\nDivision, Terri J. Scadron, Assistant Director, Office of\nImmigration Litigation, and Corey L. Farrell, Trial Attorney,\nOffice of Immigration Litigation, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                               February 8, 2008\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\f           SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge.             The petitioner, Denny\n\nStenly   Rotinsulu,      an   Indonesian    national,   is     an     Adventist\n\nChristian.    He seeks judicial review of a decision of the Board of\n\nImmigration    Appeals    (BIA)   denying     his   requests    for    asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the United Nations\n\nConvention Against Torture (CAT).          We deny the petition.\n\n           The background facts are not seriously disputed.                The\n\npetitioner is a native of Manado, a city in the Indonesian province\n\nof North Sulawesi.    He arrived lawfully in the United States as a\n\nnon-immigrant visitor on March 13, 1995, and was authorized to\n\nremain until September 13, 1995.       He overstayed.\n\n           Roughly eight years went by before federal authorities\n\ncommenced removal proceedings.       See 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B).         The\n\npetitioner conceded removability and cross-applied for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.\n\n           At a hearing before an immigration judge (IJ), the\n\npetitioner testified that he feared persecution on account of his\n\nreligion should he be remitted to Indonesia.            In support of this\n\nclaim, he recounted that he had dated a young Muslim woman from\n\n1990 to 1992, but eventually declined her importunings that they\n\nmarry.   The woman's family members reacted badly to this perceived\n\nslight. Believing that the couple had engaged in extra-marital\n\nrelations, they became enraged by the petitioner's refusal to\n\nplunge into matrimony and repeatedly threatened to kill him.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f          Despite the fact that these death threats began in 1992,\n\nthe petitioner stayed put until sojourning to the United States in\n\n1995. He at no point during that three-year interval sought either\n\nthe assistance or the protection of the police.\n\n          At the conclusion of the hearing, the IJ decided the case\n\nore tenus.    The petitioner's testimony was unrebutted and the IJ\n\ngenerally credited it.   He nonetheless rejected all three of the\n\npetitioner's claims for relief. In the IJ's view, asylum was time-\n\nbarred and no entitlement to either withholding of removal or\n\nprotection under the CAT had been proven.\n\n          The petitioner appealed to the BIA, which affirmed the\n\nIJ's decision.   This timely petition for judicial review followed.\n\n          Before us, the petitioner has abandoned his asylum claim.\n\nThat is a wise decision, as we lack jurisdiction to review the\n\nBIA's determination in regard to the timeliness of a petition for\n\nasylum.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3); Lumanauw v. Mukasey, 510 F.3d\n\n75, 76-77 (1st Cir. 2007); Pan v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d 80, 84 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).\n\n          The petitioner's brief similarly fails to spell out any\n\nchallenge to the BIA's disposition of his CAT claim.   Accordingly,\n\nwe deem that claim — like his asylum claim — to be abandoned.   See\n\nAguilar v. U.S. ICE, 510 F.3d 1, 13 n.3 (1st Cir. 2007); see also\n\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f          This leaves only the claim for withholding of removal.\n\nTo gain perspective, we pause to delineate the nature of this\n\nclaim.\n\n          Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, an alien may\n\nqualify for withholding of removal by showing a clear probability\n\nthat, upon repatriation, he will be persecuted on account of a\n\nprotected ground.      See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1208.16(b); see also INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 429-30 (1984).\n\nAn alien can make this showing by demonstrating that, more likely\n\nthan not, he will be persecuted if returned to his homeland.             See,\n\ne.g., Pan, 489 F.3d at 85-86.         The regulations place the devoir of\n\npersuasion squarely on the alien and direct an inquiring court to\n\nevaluate whether the evidence proffered by the alien satisfies the\n\nregulatory criteria.       8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b).\n\n          If the alien cannot make a direct showing as to the\n\nlikelihood of future persecution, he nonetheless may qualify for\n\nwithholding of removal by making an indirect showing.             This course\n\nentails proving that he was the victim of past persecution on\n\naccount of a protected ground, thereby triggering a rebuttable\n\npresumption    that   he    harbors    a    well-founded   fear   of   future\n\npersecution.    8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1).            Once triggered, that\n\npresumption shifts the burden to the government to prove that the\n\nalien can return safely to his native land.          See Ang v. Gonzales,\n\n430 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f           With this framework in place, we turn to the claim at\n\nhand.   Notably, the petitioner eschews any challenge to the merits\n\nof the BIA's denial of withholding of removal.          Rather, he alleges\n\nthat the BIA impermissibly engaged in de novo factfinding when it\n\naffirmed the IJ's ruling.            This challenge is legal in nature.\n\nConsequently, our review is plenary, with deference to the BIA's\n\ninterpretation of the regulations under which it operates.                 See\n\nPan, 489 F.3d at 85.\n\n           An    agency   has   an    obligation   to   abide   by   its   own\n\nregulations.      See Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 265-67\n\n(1954).   The failure to follow an applicable regulation may be a\n\nsufficient ground for vacation of an agency's decision, resulting\n\nin a remand.      See Picca v. Mukasey, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (2d Cir.\n\n2008) [2008 WL 80402, at *4]; Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 262 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).     The petitioner's argument hinges on these principles.\n\n           Refined to bare essence, his argument is that the BIA\n\nengaged in improper factfinding in contravention of one of its own\n\nregulations, thus tainting its decision and necessitating a remand.\n\nThat regulation prohibits the BIA, with exceptions not applicable\n\nhere, from \"engag[ing] in factfinding in the course of deciding\n\nappeals.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). The petitioner asseverates\n\nthat the BIA transgressed this prohibition when it concluded, in\n\nits written decision, that the death threats described by the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fpetitioner did not rise to the level of past persecution.             This\n\nposition is without merit.\n\n          To begin, the petitioner's contention is based on the\n\npremise that the BIA engaged in de novo factfinding because the IJ\n\nhad not decided the issue of past persecution.            As we explain\n\nbelow, that premise is faulty.\n\n          It is clear beyond hope of contradiction that the IJ\n\naddressed the lack of any likelihood that the petitioner would face\n\npersecution upon his return to Indonesia.        He found unambiguously\n\nthat the petitioner \"ha[d] not met his burden of proving that it is\n\nmore likely than not, or in other words, that there is a clear\n\nprobability that he will be subjected to persecution on account of\n\nhis religion or any of the [other] enumerated grounds if he were to\n\nreturn to Indonesia.\" This finding seemingly subsumes the question\n\nof past persecution.       Implicit in it is a subsidiary finding that\n\nthe petitioner's evidence did not suffice to trigger a rebuttable\n\npresumption.    That is just another way of saying that there was no\n\ncognizable showing of past persecution.\n\n          This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the IJ at\n\none   point    commented    specifically   on   the   question   of   past\n\npersecution.    Referring to the petitioner's proffer, the IJ noted\n\nthat the petitioner, on cross-examination, had virtually conceded\n\nthat his girlfriend's relatives \"essentially [were] upset because\n\nhe refused to marry [her] after he had engaged in sexual relations\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fwith her.\"         Fairly read, this comment is tantamount to a finding\n\nthat       the    death   threats   were     anchored     in   the    petitioner's\n\nphilandering, not in his religion.\n\n                 The petitioner argues that the IJ was obliged to make a\n\nmore explicit finding as to past persecution.                        This argument\n\nelevates hope over reason. Although we expect an immigration judge\n\nto make findings on all grounds that are necessary to support his\n\ndecision, those findings can be either explicit or implicit.                     See\n\nUn v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 205, 209 (1st Cir. 2005).                       The IJ's\n\nexpress determination that the petitioner failed to carry his\n\nburden of proof on the issue of future persecution, read in\n\nconjunction with his depiction of the petitioner's past experiences\n\nas no more than the aftermath of a soured romance, suffices to show\n\nthat the IJ, at least by implication, resolved the issue of past\n\npersecution.1\n\n                 There is a second reason why we deem the petitioner's\n\ncontention         unconvincing:    it     misconstrues    the      regulation    in\n\nquestion, which was promulgated as part of an effort to restrict\n\nthe \"introduction and consideration of new evidence in proceedings\n\nbefore      the    [BIA].\"    BIA   Procedural     Reforms     to    Improve     Case\n\n\n       1\n      Typically, we have found the absence of specific findings\nproblematic in cases in which such a void hampers our ability\nmeaningfully to review the issues raised on judicial review. See,\ne.g., Hernández-Barrera v. Ashcroft, 373 F.3d 9, 25 (1st Cir.\n2004). There is no such concern here; the IJ's decision, while\nbrief, provides an adequate roadmap for judicial review.\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fManagement, 67 Fed. Reg. 54,878, at 54,891 (Aug. 12, 2002).              The\n\nregulation was not intended to restrict the BIA's powers of review,\n\nincluding its power to weigh and evaluate evidence introduced\n\nbefore the IJ.     See Belortaja v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 619, 624-25 (2d\n\nCir. 2007).      Here, the BIA did not supplement the record by\n\nconsidering new evidence but, rather, merely analyzed the evidence\n\nthat had been presented in the immigration court.\n\n           The petitioner's reliance on cases such as Ramirez-Peyro\n\nv. Gonzales, 477 F.3d 637 (8th Cir. 2007), and Chen v. Bureau of\n\nCitiz. & Immig. Servs., 470 F.3d 509 (2d Cir. 2006), is mislaid.\n\nEach of those courts was confronted with a situation in which the\n\nBIA   overturned    an   IJ's   ruling   after   failing   to   cede   proper\n\ndeference to the IJ's findings of fact.           See Ramirez-Peyro, 477\n\nF.3d at 641; Chen, 470 F.3d at 515.         In contrast, the BIA in this\n\ncase did not in any way impeach, impugn, or denigrate the IJ's\n\nfactual findings; it simply explained, based upon its review of the\n\nrecord, why it considered the IJ's decision to be supportable.            We\n\ncannot say that the BIA, in following that course, violated its own\n\nregulations.\n\n           We add a coda.       If there were any material deficiency in\n\nthe BIA's decision — and we discern none — that error would have\n\nbeen harmless.     The petitioner's evidence, taken in the light most\n\nfavorable to him, suggests no more than a private squabble between\n\nhim and the family of his quondam lover.           Given the well-settled\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\frule that withholding of removal cannot be premised on what is\n\nessentially a personal dispute, Da Silva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1,\n\n6 (1st Cir. 2005), no finding of past persecution could have been\n\nmade.    See, e.g., Pieterson v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 38, 45 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).     And,    finally,    the   record   is   barren   of   any   evidence\n\nsufficient to build a bridge between the threats complained of and\n\nany government action or inaction.           That gap in the record, in and\n\nof   itself,   suffices   to    doom   the    petitioner's   claim     of   past\n\npersecution.      See, e.g., Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120-\n\n21 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe conclude that the BIA's ukase must be upheld.\n\n\n\nThe petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f",

Stevic, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111203\"><a href=\"/opinion/111203/ins-v-stevic/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 429-30 (1984).\n\nAn alien can make this showing by demonstrating that, more likely\n\nthan not, he will be persecuted if returned to his homeland.             See,\n\ne.g., Pan, 489 F.3d at 85-86.         The regulations place the devoir of\n\npersuasion squarely on the alien and direct an inquiring court to\n\nevaluate whether the evidence proffered by the alien satisfies the\n\nregulatory criteria.       8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b).\n\n          If the alien cannot make a direct showing as to the\n\nlikelihood of future persecution, he nonetheless may qualify for\n\nwithholding of removal by making an indirect showing.             This course\n\nentails proving that he was the victim of past persecution on\n\naccount of a protected ground, thereby triggering a rebuttable\n\npresumption    that   he    harbors    a    well-founded   fear   of   future\n\npersecution.    8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1).            Once triggered, that\n\npresumption shifts the burden to the government to prove that the\n\nalien can return safely to his native land.          See Ang v. Gonzales,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201939\"><a href=\"/opinion/201939/ang-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 55 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f           With this framework in place, we turn to the claim at\n\nhand.   Notably, the petitioner eschews any challenge to the merits\n\nof the BIA's denial of withholding of removal.          Rather, he alleges\n\nthat the BIA impermissibly engaged in de novo factfinding when it\n\naffirmed the IJ's ruling.            This challenge is legal in nature.\n\nConsequently, our review is plenary, with deference to the BIA's\n\ninterpretation of the regulations under which it operates.                 See\n\nPan, 489 F.3d at 85.\n\n           An    agency   has   an    obligation   to   abide   by   its   own\n\nregulations.      See Accardi v. Shaughnessy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105205\"><a href=\"/opinion/105205/united-states-ex-rel-accardi-v-shaugnessy/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 265-67\n\n(1954).   The failure to follow an applicable regulation may be a\n\nsufficient ground for vacation of an agency's decision, resulting\n\nin a remand.      See Picca v. Mukasey, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (2d Cir.\n\n2008) [2008 WL 80402, at *4]; Nelson v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771091\"><a href=\"/opinion/771091/laeila-nelson-stephanie-nelson-phil-nelson-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 262 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).     The petitioner's argument hinges on these principles.\n\n           Refined to bare essence, his argument is that the BIA\n\nengaged in improper factfinding in contravention of one of its own\n\nregulations, thus tainting its decision and necessitating a remand.\n\nThat regulation prohibits the BIA, with exceptions not applicable\n\nhere, from \"engag[ing] in factfinding in the course of deciding\n\nappeals.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). The petitioner asseverates\n\nthat the BIA transgressed this prohibition when it concluded, in\n\nits written decision, that the death threats described by the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fpetitioner did not rise to the level of past persecution.             This\n\nposition is without merit.\n\n          To begin, the petitioner's contention is based on the\n\npremise that the BIA engaged in de novo factfinding because the IJ\n\nhad not decided the issue of past persecution.            As we explain\n\nbelow, that premise is faulty.\n\n          It is clear beyond hope of contradiction that the IJ\n\naddressed the lack of any likelihood that the petitioner would face\n\npersecution upon his return to Indonesia.        He found unambiguously\n\nthat the petitioner \"ha[d] not met his burden of proving that it is\n\nmore likely than not, or in other words, that there is a clear\n\nprobability that he will be subjected to persecution on account of\n\nhis religion or any of the [other] enumerated grounds if he were to\n\nreturn to Indonesia.\" This finding seemingly subsumes the question\n\nof past persecution.       Implicit in it is a subsidiary finding that\n\nthe petitioner's evidence did not suffice to trigger a rebuttable\n\npresumption.    That is just another way of saying that there was no\n\ncognizable showing of past persecution.\n\n          This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the IJ at\n\none   point    commented    specifically   on   the   question   of   past\n\npersecution.    Referring to the petitioner's proffer, the IJ noted\n\nthat the petitioner, on cross-examination, had virtually conceded\n\nthat his girlfriend's relatives \"essentially [were] upset because\n\nhe refused to marry [her] after he had engaged in sexual relations\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fwith her.\"         Fairly read, this comment is tantamount to a finding\n\nthat       the    death   threats   were     anchored     in   the    petitioner's\n\nphilandering, not in his religion.\n\n                 The petitioner argues that the IJ was obliged to make a\n\nmore explicit finding as to past persecution.                        This argument\n\nelevates hope over reason. Although we expect an immigration judge\n\nto make findings on all grounds that are necessary to support his\n\ndecision, those findings can be either explicit or implicit.                     See\n\nUn v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201719\"><a href=\"/opinion/201719/un-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 209 (1st Cir. 2005).                       The IJ's\n\nexpress determination that the petitioner failed to carry his\n\nburden of proof on the issue of future persecution, read in\n\nconjunction with his depiction of the petitioner's past experiences\n\nas no more than the aftermath of a soured romance, suffices to show\n\nthat the IJ, at least by implication, resolved the issue of past\n\npersecution.1\n\n                 There is a second reason why we deem the petitioner's\n\ncontention         unconvincing:    it     misconstrues    the      regulation    in\n\nquestion, which was promulgated as part of an effort to restrict\n\nthe \"introduction and consideration of new evidence in proceedings\n\nbefore      the    [BIA].\"    BIA   Procedural     Reforms     to    Improve     Case\n\n\n       1\n      Typically, we have found the absence of specific findings\nproblematic in cases in which such a void hampers our ability\nmeaningfully to review the issues raised on judicial review. See,\ne.g., Hernández-Barrera v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786695\"><a href=\"/opinion/786695/fidel-angel-hernandez-barrera-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25 (1st Cir.\n2004). There is no such concern here; the IJ's decision, while\nbrief, provides an adequate roadmap for judicial review.\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fManagement, 67 Fed. Reg. 54,878, at 54,891 (Aug. 12, 2002).              The\n\nregulation was not intended to restrict the BIA's powers of review,\n\nincluding its power to weigh and evaluate evidence introduced\n\nbefore the IJ.     See Belortaja v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797562\"><a href=\"/opinion/797562/julian-belortaja-v-alberto-r-gonzales-1-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 624-25 (2d\n\nCir. 2007).      Here, the BIA did not supplement the record by\n\nconsidering new evidence but, rather, merely analyzed the evidence\n\nthat had been presented in the immigration court.\n\n           The petitioner's reliance on cases such as Ramirez-Peyro\n\nv. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796889\"><a href=\"/opinion/796889/guillermo-eduardo-ramirez-peyro-v-alberto-gonzales-attorney-general-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 2007), and Chen v. Bureau of\n\nCitiz. & Immig.

See Ramirez-Peyro, 477\n\nF.3d at 641; Chen, 470 F.3d at 515.         In contrast, the BIA in this\n\ncase did not in any way impeach, impugn, or denigrate the IJ's\n\nfactual findings; it simply explained, based upon its review of the\n\nrecord, why it considered the IJ's decision to be supportable.            We\n\ncannot say that the BIA, in following that course, violated its own\n\nregulations.\n\n           We add a coda.       If there were any material deficiency in\n\nthe BIA's decision — and we discern none — that error would have\n\nbeen harmless.     The petitioner's evidence, taken in the light most\n\nfavorable to him, suggests no more than a private squabble between\n\nhim and the family of his quondam lover.           Given the well-settled\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\frule that withholding of removal cannot be premised on what is\n\nessentially a personal dispute, Da Silva v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201398\"><a href=\"/opinion/201398/da-silva-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n6 (1st Cir. 2005), no finding of past persecution could have been\n\nmade.    See, e.g., Pieterson v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200965\"><a href=\"/opinion/200965/pieterson-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 45 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).     And,    finally,    the   record   is   barren   of   any   evidence\n\nsufficient to build a bridge between the threats complained of and\n\nany government action or inaction.           That gap in the record, in and\n\nof   itself,   suffices   to    doom   the    petitioner's   claim     of   past\n\npersecution.      See, e.g., Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201886\"><a href=\"/opinion/201886/nikijuluw-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 120-\n\n21 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe conclude that the BIA's ukase must be upheld.\n\n\n\nThe petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f</pre>",
