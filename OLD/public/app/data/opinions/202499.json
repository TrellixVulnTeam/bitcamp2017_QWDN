George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge, and\n\n                 Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the    Northern   District     of   California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f     David G. Concannon with whom Law Offices of David G.\nConcannon, Robert E. Mittel and Mittel Asen, LLC were on brief for\nappellant.\n     John G. Osborn with whom Todd S. Holbrook, Bernstein, Shur,\nSawyer & Nelson, and Joseph Odom, pro se, were on briefs for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n\n                        November 14, 2006\n\f              SCHWARZER, Senior District Judge.        Once again we address\n\nthe District of Maine’s Local Rule 7(b) which provides:\n\n              Unless within twenty (20) days after the\n              filing of a motion, the opposing party files\n              written objection thereto, incorporating a\n              memorandum of law, the opposing party shall be\n              deemed to have waived objection.\n\nIn NEPSK, Inc. d/b/a Houlton Cable v. Town of Houlton, 283 F.3d 1\n\n(1st Cir. 2002), we upheld the validity of that rule, affirming a\n\njudgment of dismissal pursuant to a motion for judgment on the\n\npleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) to which no\n\nobjection had been filed.        The case before us presents a slightly\n\ndifferent situation:        ITI submitted a response to appellees’ Rule\n\n12(b)(6) motion in the form of a motion to transfer rather than an\n\nobjection.     The district court granted the Rule 12(b)(6) motion as\n\nunopposed and entered judgment for appellees.             We affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n              Plaintiff ITI Holdings, Inc., provides certification and\n\ntraining materials to the scuba markets.              It brought this action\n\nagainst   a    group   of   competitors    in   the   scuba   market   alleging\n\ntortious interference with contractual relations and other business\n\ntorts. All defendants moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction, which was\n\ngranted as to certain of the defendants but denied as to defendants\n\nand appellees Joseph Odom, David Crockford, Joseph Keiser and\n\nMichael Ange.      That ruling has not been appealed.           The appellees\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\falso moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a\n\nclaim.    ITI did not file an objection to that motion, filing\n\ninstead a motion to transfer to the Middle District of Florida.\n\nThe   court    treated   the   Rule    12(b)(6)    motion   as   unopposed   and\n\ndismissed the complaint as to appellees under Local Rule 7(b). ITI\n\nappeals from the judgment of dismissal.\n\n                                        II.\n\n              ITI’s principal argument is that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in automatically dismissing the complaint\n\nwithout considering the standard governing the granting of Rule\n\n12(b)(6) motions.        Such motions, ITI argues, may be granted only\n\nif it appears to a certainty that plaintiff would be unable to\n\nrecover under any set of facts.          It seeks to analogize its case to\n\nJaroma v. Massey, 873 F.2d 17 (1st Cir. 1989) (per curiam), which\n\nheld it to be error to grant a summary judgment motion based\n\nsolely on the opposing party’s failure to respond to the motion,\n\nnoting that under Rule 56, the motion must be denied even if\n\nunopposed where the supporting evidence does not establish the\n\nabsence of a genuine issue.           Id. at 20.   We rejected this analogy\n\nin Town of Houlton in the context of a Rule 12(c) motion, pointing\n\nout that unlike Rule 56, nothing in the text of Rule 12(c) compels\n\nthe court to apply any particular standard when deciding whether\n\nto grant or deny a motion for judgment on the pleadings.              283 F.3d\n\nat 8-9.   The same is true of Rule 12(b)(6):            Nothing in its text\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fcompels the court to apply any particular standard in deciding\n\nwhether to grant or deny a motion.          Thus, our holding in Town of\n\nHoulton that strict enforcement of Local Rule 7(b) creates no\n\nimpermissible conflict with Rule 12(c) applies with equal force to\n\nRule 12(b)(6).      Id. at 9.\n\n                                    III.\n\n           ITI next contends that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in failing to find excusable neglect or considering\n\nwhether dismissal was in the interest of justice.          It argues that\n\nit filed a timely response by filing a motion to transfer venue in\n\nwhich, rather than objecting to the Rule 12(b)(6) motion, it\n\nasserted that it “intend[ed] to file an amended complaint as a\n\nmatter of right.”      We find its arguments unpersuasive.\n\n           To begin with, the argument rests on quicksand because\n\nITI, not having moved the district court under Federal Rule of\n\nCivil   Procedure    60(b)   for   relief   from   the   dismissal   order,\n\narguably forfeited its right to charge that court with abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   ITI says it should at least have been granted leave\n\nto respond to the Rule 12(b)(6) motion, but again, it never\n\nrequested leave.     Moreover, as a textual matter, ITI’s “response”\n\nin the form of a venue transfer motion does not comply with Local\n\nRule 7(b), which requires the filing of written objection to the\n\nmotion incorporating a memorandum of law.          Finally, that ITI may\n\nhave intended to file an amended complaint hardly supports a claim\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fof excusable neglect, considering that it failed to file one (or\n\nmove for leave to file one) in the ten-week period between its\n\nreceipt of appellees’ motion to dismiss and the issuance of the\n\nmagistrate judge’s recommended decision.\n\n          As we stated in Town of Houlton, “it is within the\n\ndistrict court’s discretion to dismiss an action based on a\n\nparty’s unexcused failure to respond to a dispositive motion when\n\nsuch response is required by local rule, at least when the result\n\ndoes not clearly offend equity.”        283 F.3d at 7.    ITI has not\n\nshown either that the district court automatically dismisses cases\n\nevery time the local rule is violated or that the dismissal of its\n\ncomplaint offends equity.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n          ITI’s final argument is that the district court lacked\n\njurisdiction to dismiss the tort claims.           It argues that the\n\nmagistrate judge found sufficient evidence to support personal\n\njurisdiction over appellees Ange, Crockford and Keiser only with\n\nrespect to the contract claims.    Therefore, it contends, the court\n\nlacked jurisdiction to dismiss the tort claims against these\n\nappellees.\n\n          We   reject   the   argument.      The    magistrate   judge\n\nrecommended that the motion to dismiss for lack of personal\n\njurisdiction be denied in its entirety as to appellees and the\n\ndistrict court so ordered.    Thus, the appellees were obliged to\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fplead to all of ITI’s claims alleged in its complaint and they did\n\nso by filing their Rule 12(b)(6) motion, bringing Local Rule 7(b)\n\ninto play.\n\n          Affirmed.   Costs to be awarded to appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

The same is true of Rule 12(b)(6): Nothing in its text compels the court to apply any particular standard in deciding whether to grant or deny a motion. Thus, our holding in <i>Town of Houlton</i> that strict enforcement of Local Rule 7(b) creates no impermissible conflict with Rule 12(c) applies with equal force to Rule 12(b)(6). <i>Id.</i> at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ITI next contends that the district court abused its discretion in failing to find excusable neglect or considering whether dismissal was in the interest of justice. It argues that it filed a timely response by filing a motion to transfer venue in which, rather than objecting to the Rule 12(b)(6) motion, it asserted that it \"intend[ed] to file an amended complaint as a matter of right.\" We find its arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin with, the argument rests on quicksand because ITI, not having moved the district court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) for relief from the dismissal order, arguably forfeited its right to charge that court with abuse of discretion. ITI says it should at least have been granted leave to respond to the Rule 12(b)(6) motion, but again, it never requested leave. Moreover, as a textual matter, ITI's \"response\" in the form of a venue transfer motion does not comply with Local Rule 7(b), which requires the filing of written objection to the motion incorporating a memorandum of law. Finally, that ITI may have intended to file an amended complaint hardly supports a claim of excusable neglect, considering that it failed to file one (or move for leave to file one) in the ten-week period between its receipt of appellees' motion to dismiss and the issuance of the magistrate judge's recommended decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we stated in <i>Town of Houlton,</i> \"it is within the district court's discretion to dismiss an action based on a party's unexcused failure to respond to a dispositive motion when such response is required by local rule, at least when the result does not clearly offend equity.\" 283 F.3d at 7. ITI has not shown either that the district court automatically dismisses cases every time the local rule is violated or that the dismissal of its complaint offends equity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ITI's final argument is that the district court lacked jurisdiction to dismiss the tort claims. It argues that the magistrate judge found sufficient evidence to support personal jurisdiction over appellees Ange, Crockford and Keiser only with respect to the contract claims. Therefore, it contends, the court lacked jurisdiction to dismiss the tort claims against these appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the argument. The magistrate judge recommended that the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction be denied in its entirety as to appellees and the district court so ordered. Thus, the appellees were obliged to plead to all of ITI's claims alleged in its complaint and they did so by filing their Rule 12(b)(6) motion, bringing Local Rule 7(b) into play.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Affirmed.</i> Costs to be awarded to appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
