We have substituted him for John\nAshcroft, previous holder of that office, as the respondent. See\nFed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f              Per Curiam.     Immaculada Bencosme de Rodriguez, a native\n\nand citizen of the Dominican Republic, petitions for review of the\n\ndecision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirming the\n\ndenial   of    her   application     for    cancellation     of    removal.      The\n\nImmigration      Judge     (\"IJ\")    determined,     inter    alia,      that    the\n\npetitioner had failed to establish that removal would result in\n\n\"exceptional and extremely unusual hardship\" to her United States\n\ncitizen children. 8 U.S.C. ยง 1229b(b)(1)(D). We lack jurisdiction\n\nto review this discretionary decision. Id. ยง 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); see\n\nBernal-Vallejo v. INS, 195 F.3d 56, 59-60 (1st Cir. 1999).                       See\n\nalso Leyva v. Ashcroft, 380 F.3d 303, 305-306 (7th Cir. 2004)(court\n\nlacks jurisdiction to review \"exceptional and extremely unusual\n\nhardship\" determination); Mendez-Moranchel v.

Ashcroft, 327\n\nF.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir. 2003) (similar).\n\n              Relatedly, we will not review the petitioner's claim that\n\nimproper judicial conduct by the Immigration Judge violated her due\n\nprocess rights because the petitioner failed to raise this claim in\n\nher   appeal    to   the    BIA   and   therefore    failed       to   exhaust   her\n\nadministrative remedies.            8 U.S.C. ยง 1252(d)(1); see Sayyah v.\n\nFarquharson, 382 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 2004); see also Olujoke v.\n\nGonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 22-23 (1st Cir. 2005)(doctrine of exhaustion\n\nof administrative remedies bars effort to raise claim in petition\n\nfor   review     where     petitioner      \"failed   to   make     any   developed\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fargumentation in support of that claim before the BIA\").

We grant, as\n\na matter of equity, the petitioner's motions to stay removal and to\n\ntoll the voluntary departure period nunc pro tunc to August 6, 2004\n\n(the date on which she filed her timely motion to stay).

The motions to stay\n\nremoval and to toll the voluntary departure period are granted nunc\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fpro tunc to August 6, 2004, and will expire upon issuance of\n\nmandate.\n\n\n\n\n                            -4-\n\f",
