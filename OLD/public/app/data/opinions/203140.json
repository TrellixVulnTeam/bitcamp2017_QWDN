This is an appeal from the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment dismissing all of the\n\nplaintiff's    claims   and    allowing,     in   part,   the   defendants'\n\ncounterclaims. The plaintiff-appellant, Puerto Rico Electric Power\n\nAuthority (\"PREPA\"), is a public utility that generates and sells\n\nelectric power to businesses and residents of Puerto Rico.              The\n\ndefendants-appellees     are     Action     Refund,   a   North     Carolina\n\ncorporation engaged in the business of helping qualified entities\n\nobtain refunds from the United States Department of Energy (\"DOE\"),\n\nand its principal, Stanley K. Wallin.\n\n          In   September      2004,   the   parties   signed    a   contract\n\n(hereinafter, \"the Contract\") which provided that Action Refund\n\nwould act as a representative in PREPA's claim for refunds and be\n\npaid twenty percent of the total amount received.           PREPA received\n\na refund of $3 million and refused to pay the twenty percent fee,\n\nasserting that the Contract was invalid.          In December 2006, PREPA\n\nfiled the instant suit against Wallin and Action Refund, seeking a\n\ndeclaratory judgment to invalidate the Contract and damages for\n\nfraud, fraudulent inducement, and unconscionability.\n\n          Wallin and Action Refund moved for summary judgment on\n\nonly the declaratory judgment count.        The court granted the motion\n\nand, sua sponte, dismissed the remaining three counts. Upon motion\n\nof the defendants, the court then granted summary judgment on their\n\ncounterclaims: the court declared the Contract to be valid and\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fbinding and that the defendants were entitled to payment of the\n\ntwenty percent fee.        PREPA appealed.     After careful consideration,\n\nwe affirm the district court's orders.\n\n                                  I.   Background\n\n            In 1986, a federal multi-district litigation alleged that\n\nvarious producers and sellers of domestic crude oil and refined\n\npetroleum products were overcharging customers in violation of DOE\n\nregulations.        The     litigation     resulted    in    a   settlement      of\n\napproximately $5 billion in overcharges from the offending parties.\n\nThe DOE collected the funds and created a repayment process in\n\nwhich affected end-use consumers could submit claims to obtain a\n\nshare of the overcharges.              The refunds were disbursed in three\n\nrounds: the first in the late 1980s, the second in the mid-1990s,\n\nand the third in 2004.\n\n            PREPA was among the affected end-use consumers; after\n\nsubmitting its claims in 1988, it received a refund of nearly $7\n\nmillion in 1997.         In May 2004, the DOE published procedures to\n\nobtain refunds in the third and final round.             See Final Procedures\n\nfor Distribution of Remaining Crude Oil Overcharge Refunds, 69 Fed.\n\nReg.   29,300     (May    21,   2004).      This    round,   limited    to   those\n\n\"successful claimants\" who had already received refunds, required\n\nclaimants    to    submit       the    necessary    paperwork    on    or    before\n\nDecember 31, 2004, or otherwise forfeit all rights to the refund.\n\nId. at 29,304.       In addition to the publication in the Federal\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fRegister, written notice was to be sent to the approximately 3,400\n\neligible claimants.      Id.      PREPA asserts that it never received\n\nwritten notice from the DOE.1\n\n           Since 1992, Wallin had assisted claimants in obtaining\n\npetroleum refunds.      Through a subcontracting relationship with a\n\nrefund claimant company, PBA Tax Accounting, Inc., Wallin contacted\n\ncompanies that qualified for the DOE refund program and offered to\n\nhelp prepare and submit the necessary documentation.           Sometime in\n\n1993, he learned that PREPA's application was still pending and\n\noffered to help facilitate the refund process.               PREPA and PBA\n\nsigned a contract providing that PBA would receive a service fee of\n\nten percent of the total refund amount in return for its services.\n\nThe relationship soured in 1997 when PREPA received the nearly $7\n\nmillion refund check and refused to pay PBA.           The parties settled\n\nthe dispute for $250,000 in October 1998.\n\n           In the summer of 2004, Wallin, now the sole proprietor of\n\nAction Refund, discovered that PREPA had not claimed its third-\n\nround refund.    Wallin contacted PREPA and offered to assist in the\n\nrefund process. On August 6, 2004, he submitted a written proposal\n\nfor   services   as   well   as   a   proposed   contract.    The   proposal\n\nauthorized Action Refund to act as PREPA's representative.               In\n\n\n\n1\n  It appears that the DOE mailed PREPA's notice to a San Juan Post\nOffice Box address in the care of the attorney who had filed the\noriginal refund application in 1988; he was no longer associated\nwith PREPA in 2004.\n\n                                      -4-\n\freturn for providing information and services about refunds, Action\n\nRefund was to receive twenty percent of the money.                         Various\n\nemployees at PREPA, including its legal department, reviewed the\n\nproposed contract.           They asked for, and received, additional\n\ninformation about Wallin and Action Refund.            At no time did either\n\nparty discuss the prior relationship between PREPA and PBA.                  PREPA\n\nproposed the addition of a paragraph limiting Action Refund's\n\nauthorization to one year.           Wallin agreed and the Contract was\n\nexecuted by the parties on September 20 and 21, 2004.\n\n            On October 4, 2004, Wallin submitted PREPA's verification\n\ndocumentation to the DOE and made various follow-up communications.\n\nIn January 2005, the DOE contacted PREPA and requested that it\n\nsubmit a verification form which was identical to the one submitted\n\nby Wallin in October.         On March 28, 2006, PREPA received a refund\n\ncheck for $3 million.          Wallin demanded the twenty percent fee\n\ndescribed in the contract and PREPA refused.\n\n            PREPA    filed    the   instant    suit   in    the   United    States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Puerto Rico against Wallin and\n\nAction   Refund     on   December   16,   2005   on   the    basis   of    federal\n\ndiversity     jurisdiction,         seeking:     a    declaratory         judgment\n\nestablishing that the Contract is void and invalid (Count One) and\n\ndamages for fraud in the inducement, fraud, and unconscionability\n\n(Counts Two, Three, and Four, respectively).                      The defendants\n\nanswered and filed a counterclaim seeking their own declaratory\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fjudgment establishing the validity of the Contract, by which Action\n\nRefund is entitled to twenty percent of the refund, and damages for\n\nthe breach. Following discovery, the defendants filed a motion for\n\nsummary judgment with respect to Count One only. PREPA opposed the\n\nmotion.     On December 29, 2006, the district court allowed the\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment on Count One and sua sponte\n\ndismissed    PREPA's   remaining    three    counts,   leaving    only   the\n\ndefendants' counterclaims.\n\n            Two   months   later,   the   defendants   moved   for   summary\n\njudgment on their counterclaims.          PREPA opposed the motion and\n\nasserted that the district court's sua sponte dismissal of Counts\n\nTwo, Three, and Four of its complaint was improper.            On March 15,\n\n2007, the district court issued an order giving PREPA \"ten days to\n\noppose the summary disposition of its claims, and said response\n\nmust be filed with the Court on or before March 29, 2007.\"             PREPA\n\nv. Action Refund, No. 05-2302 (D.P.R. Mar. 15, 2007) (order giving\n\nPREPA ten days to oppose disposition).        In response, PREPA filed a\n\nmotion to vacate the December 29 dismissal of its complaint.              On\n\nMarch 30, 2007, the district court entered an order and final\n\njudgment allowing, in part,2 the defendants' motion for summary\n\njudgment on its counterclaims and denying PREPA's motion to vacate\n\nthe December judgment.\n\n\n\n2\n  The district court's order denied the defendants' motion seeking\npre-judgment interest and attorneys' fees.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f                              II.   Discussion\n\n            A.    Standard of Review\n\n            We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo, and the record is evaluated in the light most favorable to\n\nthe nonmoving party, indulging all reasonable inferences in that\n\nparty's favor.     See Chao v. Hotel Oasis, Inc., 493 F.3d 26, 33 (1st\n\nCir. 2007); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.\n\n            On appeal, PREPA challenges the district court's decision\n\non   procedural    and   substantive    grounds.   It   asserts   that   the\n\ndistrict court erred in entering summary judgment sua sponte on\n\nCounts Two, Three, and Four, without providing sufficient notice.\n\nIt also contends that, irrespective of the notice issue, the\n\nevidence on the record demonstrates that there are genuine issues\n\nof material fact with respect to all counts as well as the\n\ncounterclaims.\n\n            B.    Count One: Declaratory Judgment\n\n            Count One of the complaint seeks a declaratory judgment\n\nestablishing that the Contract is void and invalid for lack of\n\nconsideration. Specifically, PREPA asserts that the DOE refund was\n\nnot obtained through \"any information or work by Action Refund.\"\n\nThe district court allowed the defendants' motion for summary\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f             We begin with the requirements for a valid contract under\n\nPuerto Rico law:3 (1) consent of the parties, (2) a definite object\n\nof the contract, and (3) consideration.            See P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n31,   §   3391   (2004).    PREPA   alleges      that   the    contract   lacked\n\nconsideration because it was already entitled to the refund without\n\nany further action on the part of the defendants.4              The allegation\n\nstems     from   PREPA's   realization    that    Action      Refund   had   only\n\ncompleted a simple, one-page form to obtain the refund.                      PREPA\n\ncontends that the form is one that could easily have been completed\n\nwithout Action Refund and, therefore, there was no consideration.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n\n\n\n3\n   Because this case is brought under diversity jurisdiction, we\nconsider all of PREPA's claims under Puerto Rico contract law.\nSee, e.g., Cabán Hernández v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., 486 F.3d 1,\n11 (1st Cir. 2007).\n4\n    Count One alleges invalidity of the Contract for lack of\nconsideration. However, in its opposition to summary judgment on\nthis count (as well as in its brief on appeal), PREPA contends that\nthe Contract is also invalid for lack of consent because of fraud\nor \"dolo.\" Given the complaint's failure to make this allegation\nin Count One, much less meet the Rule 9(b) particularity\nrequirement for allegations of \"dolo\" involving fraud, see\nGeneradora De Electricidad Del Caribe, Inc. v. Foster Wheeler\nCorp., 92 F. Supp. 2d 8, 20 (D.P.R. 2000), we will discuss fraud\nonly within Counts Two and Three. We note, however, that the lack\nof consent argument is unpersuasive. It is hard to see how PREPA,\na sophisticated and experienced corporation with a legal department\nwho reviewed the Contract, was a victim of deceit in this case.\nSee Raytheon-Catalytic, Inc. v. Gulf Chem. Corp., 959 F. Supp. 100,\n109 (D.P.R. 1997) (finding that a \"person's education, his social\nand economic status, his relations, and the type of business in\nwhich he is engaged are significant when trying to determine the\nexistence of 'dolus' that would void his consent\").\n\n                                    -8-\n\f           The   Contract,   signed   by   both   parties,     provided   as\n\nfollows:\n\n           1. I hereby authorize Action Refund to act as\n           our representative in the claim for Petroleum\n           Refunds.\n\n           2. Action Refund will provide information and\n           services about refunds regarding petroleum and\n           petroleum product overcharges.\n\n           3. All refunds and interest realized in our\n           favor as a result of the information and work\n           performed by Action Refund will be sent\n           directly to [PREPA].\n\n           4.   All refunds realized will be shared as\n           follows: Action Refund will receive 20% of an\n           amount equal to the total amount received and\n           it is understood no other cost or fees will be\n           paid to Action Refund.\n\n           5. Upon receipt of the refund check [PREPA]\n           will remit the appropriate amount of refund\n           due to Action Refund within seven working\n           days.\n\n           6.   This authorization is effective for one\n           year commencing on the date of September 21,\n           2004.\n\n\nThe   Contract   thus   specified   that   in   return   for   successfully\n\nobtaining a crude oil refund on behalf of PREPA, Action Refund\n\nwould receive twenty percent of the refund.5              Action Refund's\n\n\n5\n   While PREPA automatically qualified for the refund, the Federal\nRegister Notice makes clear that without further proactive steps by\nPREPA before the December 2004 deadline, it would not have been\neligible to obtain the final refund. In September 2004, when the\nparties signed the Contract, no submission to the DOE entitled\nPREPA to a third-round refund. In fact, the record indicates that\nas of the December 31, 2004 deadline, no forms were filed by or on\nbehalf of PREPA other than that submitted by Wallin and Action\n\n                                    -9-\n\fpromise to act on behalf of PREPA and render services necessary to\n\nobtain the refund is consideration for the Contract. See P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. tit. 31, § 3431 (\"[the] promise of a thing or services by the\n\nother party is understood as a consideration\").\n\n            PREPA's related argument –- that the consideration is\n\ninadequate because those services amounted only to the filing of a\n\nsingle piece of paper -- is similarly unavailing.                    A general\n\nprinciple of contract law provides that \"courts will not inquire\n\ninto the adequacy of consideration in an agreed-upon exchange,\"\n\nunless that consideration is \"'so grossly inadequate as to shock\n\nthe conscience of the court.'\"         Kenda Corp., Inc. v. Pot O'Gold\n\nMoney Leagues, Inc., 329 F.3d 216, 229 (1st Cir. 2003) (citation\n\nomitted).    We do not believe, taking into account the facts of this\n\ncase, that the promise of services to obtain a $3 million refund in\n\nreturn for a twenty percent fee can be considered so grossly\n\ninadequate as to shock the conscience of the court.              Moreover, the\n\nparties in this case are sophisticated business entities who\n\nengaged in arms-length negotiations. Given that they bargained and\n\ncontracted    for    consideration    terms    which     they    deemed   to   be\n\nsufficient (and are sufficient under the law), we are loathe, on\n\nappeal, to \"evaluate the relative adequacy of the consideration or\n\nto reweigh the soundness of the parties' judgments.\" In re Newport\n\nPlaza     Assocs.,   L.P.,   985   F.2d     640,   647    (1st    Cir.    1993).\n\n\nRefund.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fAccordingly,      the       district   court     appropriately     entered   summary\n\njudgment in favor of the defendants on Count One of the complaint.\n\n            C.    Counts Two Through Four: Fraud and Unconscionability\n\n                        1.    Procedural Issues\n\n            After its summary dismissal of Count One, the district\n\ncourt   went     on    to    dismiss   the     remaining   three    claims   without\n\nproviding      prior    notice    to    the    parties.     The    district    court\n\nexplained:\n\n            Though Count [One] is titled and focuses on\n            seeking a declaratory judgment from the Court\n            due to lack of consideration, [PREPA] also\n            draws from its other counts, namely its fraud\n            and fraud in the inducement counts, to support\n            its arguments. Consequently, the Court here\n            evaluates   whether    summary   judgment   is\n            appropriate for each of Plaintiff's claims.\n\n\nPuerto Rico Electric Power Auth. v. Action Refund, 472 F. Supp. 2d\n\n133, 135 n.1 (D.P.R. 2006) (\"PREPA I\").\n\n            It    is        without    question    that    district    courts,    in\n\nappropriate circumstances, are entitled to enter summary judgment\n\nsua sponte.           See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 326\n\n(1986); accord Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc., 89 F.3d 24, 29\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).         In an effort to limit \"the unfairness lurking in\n\nthis approach,\" Sánchez v. Triple-S Mgmt. Corp., 492 F.3d 1, 7 (1st\n\nCir. 2007), we have required two conditions prior to the district\n\ncourt's exercise of such a right:\n\n            First,   the  discovery  process  \"must  be\n            sufficiently advanced that the parties have\n\n                                          -11-\n\f            enjoyed a reasonable opportunity to glean the\n            material facts.\" Second, the district court\n            must provide \"the targeted party appropriate\n            notice and a chance to present its evidence on\n            the essential elements of the claim or\n            defense.\"\n\nId. (quoting Berkovitz, 89 F.3d at 29).            There is no dispute that\n\nthe first Berkovitz requirement is satisfied: the parties had\n\ncompleted discovery and had even filed pretrial memoranda when the\n\ndistrict court ruled on the defendants' motion for summary judgment\n\nas to Count One.     The district court, however, failed to give any\n\nnotice of its intention to enter summary judgment on the other\n\nthree counts of the complaint.\n\n            We have previously observed that a failure to provide\n\nadequate notice is not necessarily reversible error requiring a\n\nremand to the district court.        See Vives v. Fajardo, 472 F.3d 19,\n\n22 (1st Cir. 2007) (finding that lack of notice was not reversible\n\nerror    where   appealing   party   could   not    demonstrate   prejudice)\n\n(citing Ward v.

Mayor & Council of the City of Wilmington, 355 F.3d 215,\n\n219 (3d Cir. 2004) (recognizing a narrow exception to the notice\n\nrequirement where the record is fully developed, the issue is\n\npurely legal, and there is no prejudice to the parties).            Evidence\n\n                                     -12-\n\fthat the appealing party was procedurally prejudiced as a result of\n\nthe failure to provide notice before sua sponte dismissal requires\n\nreversal.     If, however, the appellant cannot demonstrate such\n\nprejudice -- by establishing that it was unable to present evidence\n\nin support of its position as a result of the unfair surprise –-\n\nthe failure to provide notice is harmless error and a remand would\n\nbe futile.6   See Vives, 472 F.3d at 22.\n\n            Our inquiry is focused on whether PREPA was procedurally\n\nprejudiced by the lack of notice.          In the summary judgment order,\n\nthe   district   court    explained   the       appropriateness    of   summary\n\njudgment for all of the counts in the complaint because PREPA drew\n\nfrom those other counts to support its arguments.              PREPA I, 472 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 135 n.1.      Specifically, PREPA presented arguments and\n\nsupporting    evidence    in   support     of    its   fraud   claims   in   its\n\nopposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the\n\ndeclaratory judgment count. Even on appeal, PREPA fuses the counts\n\ntogether and alleges that the district court improperly granted\n\nsummary   judgment   on    Count   One   because       the   defendants   acted\n\nfraudulently.7\n\n\n\n6\n   Given the risk of unfairness and the low cost of providing\nnotice, we do not encourage the practice of sua sponte summary\ndismissal. See, e.g., Bridgeway Corp. v. Citibank, 201 F.3d 134,\n139 (2d Cir. 2000).\n7\n  In its brief, PREPA asserts that the contract is invalid because\nthe defendants \"misrepresented and omitted material facts that\nillicitly induced PREPA officials to agree to the 2004 Contract.\"\n\n                                    -13-\n\f              The     procedural   posture    of   this   case    is     further\n\ncomplicated by subsequent orders by the district court.                Following\n\nthe court's dismissal of the complaint, the defendants moved for\n\nsummary judgment on their counterclaim.            As part of its opposition\n\nto the motion, PREPA argued that the court's sua sponte summary\n\ndismissal of its entire complaint, without proper notice, was\n\ncontrary to Rule 56 and a violation of due process.               In response,\n\non March 15, 2007, the district court ordered PREPA to file an\n\nopposition to the summary disposition of the claims within ten\n\ndays.        On March 29, 2007, PREPA filed a motion to set aside\n\njudgment in which it asserted that genuine issues of material fact\n\npreclude the entry of summary judgment on all counts.\n\n              PREPA's motion to set aside judgment provides us with a\n\nunique opportunity to review what, if any, additional information\n\nPREPA was prevented from presenting to the court as a result of the\n\nlack    of    notice.8      A   comparison    between   PREPA's    filings   on\n\nNovember 22 (opposition to summary judgment) and March 29 (motion\n\nto     set    aside    judgment)   reveals    indistinguishable        arguments\n\nregarding      numerous    allegedly   fraudulent    misrepresentations      by\n\nWallin, accompanied by several exhibits and deposition excerpts in\n\nsupport of those allegations.             PREPA points to no additional\n\n\n\n8\n    We need not determine whether a district court can cure\nprocedural prejudice resulting from lack of notice through this\nkind of post-dismissal order because no prejudice occurred in this\ncase.\n\n                                       -14-\n\fmaterial evidence that it would otherwise have presented to the\n\ncourt had it been given notice that the court was considering its\n\nfraud and fraudulent inducement claims. Therefore, with respect to\n\nCounts     Two    and    Three    (fraudulent              inducement     and    fraud,\n\nrespectively), PREPA is unable to demonstrate procedural prejudice\n\nas a result of the lack of notice.\n\n              PREPA also fails to show prejudice with respect to Count\n\nFour, unconscionability.           According to both the complaint and\n\nPREPA's motion to vacate judgment, this count is based on Wallin's\n\nallegedly \"unreasonable coerc[ion of PREPA] into agreeing to the\n\n20% commission fee,\" based on Wallin's alleged misrepresentations\n\nabout the length and complexity of the process.                    The arguments and\n\nevidence PREPA would have proffered in support of its arguments are\n\nthe same as those submitted to the court in its November opposition\n\nfilings.      As PREPA failed to demonstrate that it was procedurally\n\nprecluded from providing evidence in support of its fraud claims,\n\nPREPA    is   likewise   unable    to    make        the    same     showing    for   its\n\nunconscionability claim.\n\n              Any error by the district court in considering PREPA's\n\nadditional claims on summary judgment was harmless.                      PREPA placed\n\nthose claims at issue by raising them in its November reply brief\n\nto the defendants' motion for summary judgment, to which they\n\nattached      numerous   exhibits.         When      given     the    opportunity      to\n\ndemonstrate      prejudice   for     the       sua    sponte       dismissal,     PREPA\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\freasserted the same arguments and failed to identify evidence which\n\nit was precluded from presenting in support of its claims.        Under\n\nthese   unique   circumstances,   PREPA   was   afforded   an   adequate\n\nopportunity to present the evidence in support of its claim.\n\n                   2.   Substantive Issues\n\n           On summary disposition, we take the facts as they appear\n\nin the record and draw inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.\n\nOrtiz-Piñero v. Rivera-Arroyo, 84 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nUnder Puerto Rico law, the party alleging fraud has the burden of\n\ndemonstrating: (1) a false representation by the defendant; (2) the\n\nplaintiff's reasonable and foreseeable reliance thereon; (3) injury\n\nto the plaintiff as a result of the reliance; and (4) an intent to\n\ndefraud. See Microsoft Corp. v. Computer Warehouse, 83 F. Supp. 2d\n\n256, 262 (D.P.R. 2000); see also 31 L.P.R.A. § 3408. The applicable\n\nPuerto Rico contract law regarding fraud has a strong underlying\n\npresumption in favor of good faith and honesty; the party alleging\n\nfraud has the burden of presenting evidence which is \"strong,\n\nclear, unchallengeable, convincing, and conclusive, since a mere\n\npreponderance of the evidence is not sufficient to establish the\n\nexistence of fraud in [Puerto Rico].\"           Prado Álvarez v. R.J.\n\nReynolds Tobacco Co., 313 F. Supp. 2d 61, 77 (D.P.R. 2004) (quoting\n\nF.C. Imports, Inc. v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston, N.A., 816 F.\n\nSupp. 78, 87 (D.P.R. 1993)), aff'd, 405 F.3d 36 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\f            In Counts Two and Three, PREPA alleges that Wallin, on\n\nbehalf of Action Refund, made various misrepresentations regarding\n\nthe necessity of retaining Action Refund's services.                   In its\n\nfilings,    PREPA   elaborates   on     those    allegations:   (1)    Wallin\n\nfraudulently represented that the process was complex and tedious\n\ndespite knowing that it involved only a one-page verification\n\ndocument; and (2) Wallin failed to notify PREPA of their prior\n\nbusiness relationship.9\n\n            After review of the record, we conclude that PREPA cannot\n\npresent strong and unchallenged evidence which establishes the\n\nexistence of fraud.       On the contrary, the evidence demonstrates\n\nthat the allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation are challenged\n\nvigorously by the defendants.         Moreover, PREPA's fraud claims fail\n\nfor lack of reasonable reliance.         See Wadsworth Inc., v. Schwarz-\n\nNin, 951 F. Supp. 314, 323 (D.P.R. 1996) (\"[T]he unreasonableness\n\nof the plaintiff's reliance may be regarded as sufficient evidence\n\nthat   he   did     not   in   fact    rely     upon   the   claimed    false\n\nrepresentation.\" (citing F.C. Imports, 816 F. Supp. at 87)).\n\n\n\n\n9\n   The defendants also contend that the allegations of fraud were\nnot asserted with sufficient particularity in the complaint. At\noral argument, PREPA informed the court that it had sought to amend\nits complaint, but the district court denied the request and\nordered the parties to submit statements describing the parties'\nprior relationship. In light of our conclusion that the district\ncourt properly dismissed the claims, we need not reach the issue of\nsufficiency of the allegations under the Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure Rule 9(b) heightened pleading standard.\n\n                                      -17-\n\fPuerto   Rico      law   places    little      weight    on    a    sophisticated      and\n\nexperienced business party's assertion of unknowing reliance.                           See\n\nRamírez, Segal & Látimer v. Rigual, 23 P.R. Offic. Trans. 156, 166\n\n(1989) (finding that the parties were \"savvy businessmen\" and\n\n\"persons     well    versed   in       business   and    financial       matters\"       and\n\nconcluding that they must have been aware of the possible outcome\n\nof the contract's terms); Planned Credit of Puerto Rico, Inc. v.\n\nPage,    3   P.R.    Offic.   Trans.      341,    355    (1975)      (looking     at    the\n\nplaintiff's education and business experience in rejecting the\n\nclaim that he was deceived and induced into the transaction), cited\n\nwith approval in Wadsworth, 951 F. Supp. at 325.                               Given the\n\nbusiness sophistication of PREPA and the review of the Contract by\n\nits   own    legal    department,        the   publicly       available       information\n\nregarding the claim application process, and PREPA's decision not\n\nto add specific contractual terms regarding the amount or type of\n\nwork expected from Action Refund, any reliance upon the alleged\n\nmisrepresentation is not reasonable.\n\n             Furthermore,         we    reject    PREPA's          argument    that     the\n\ndefendants committed fraud by failing to inform PREPA of Wallin's\n\nprior relationship with PREPA. This makes little sense from either\n\na   legal    or    business   perspective.          Wallin's         allegedly    \"prior\n\ncontentious relationship\" was not hidden from PREPA; in fact, that\n\nrelationship had been with PREPA itself.                      Cf. United States v.\n\nJosleyn,     206    F.3d   144,    159    (1st    Cir.    2000)      (explaining       that\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\fknowledge obtained by an employee in the course of his work and\n\nwithin his scope of authority is imputed to the employer company).\n\nTo impose a duty on the defendants to disclose information known to\n\nPREPA through its employees would effectively fault them for\n\nPREPA's own deficiencies in institutional knowledge.                 Thus, as a\n\nmatter of law, PREPA fails to meet the standard for fraud under\n\nPuerto Rico law.\n\n              Given the facts of this case, PREPA's fourth claim,\n\nunconscionability, is disposed of quickly.             Unconscionability is a\n\ntraditional, equitable remedy which will void an otherwise legally\n\nvalid contract.         See 8 Williston on Contracts, § 18:1 (4th ed.\n\n2007). Puerto Rico law recognizes such judicial intervention where\n\na contract exhibits an \"excessively onerous quality that reaches\n\nthe point of bad faith, and defeats those rules of collective\n\nconduct       that    must   be   observed    by    every   honest   and   loyal\n\nconscience.\" López de Victoria v. Rodríguez, 13 P.R. Offic. Trans.\n\n341, 349 (1982); see also Casera Foods, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 8 P.R.\n\nOffic. Trans. 914 (1979) (applying an equitable remedy when an\n\nunforeseeable change of circumstances alters the contract into an\n\nobjectively unfair one).            This is not such a case.          PREPA, a\n\nbillion-dollar utility freely signed the Contract after several\n\nweeks of review by its own legal department.                Cf. Riesett v. W.B.\n\nDoner     &    Co.,    293   F.3d    164,     173   (4th    Cir.   2002)   (\"The\n\nunconscionability doctrine has no application to contracts . . .\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fwhich were entered into by sophisticated parties who bargained at\n\narms' length.\").        Therefore, the district court properly concluded\n\nthat the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\n            D.    Defendants' Counterclaims\n\n            Lastly, PREPA contends that the district court erred in\n\ngranting    the   defendants'      motion    for   summary      judgment    on    its\n\ncounterclaims.          The   defendants    sought   a    declaratory      judgment\n\nestablishing the validity of the contract and an award of interest,\n\nfees, and costs.        The district court concluded that the Contract\n\nwas valid and that Action Refund was entitled to payment pursuant\n\nto the Contract's terms, but denied the request for interest, fees,\n\nand    costs.     The    court   concluded    that       the   Contract    made   no\n\nstipulation or reference to interest and there was no evidence of\n\nunreasonable litigiousness to justify the imposition of fees and\n\ncosts.10\n\n            The defendants' counterclaim for declaratory judgment is\n\neffectively the reverse of the plaintiff's claim in Count One.\n\nThus, for all of the reasons outlined above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's determination that the Contract is valid and binding, and\n\nin accordance with its terms, Action Refund is entitled to twenty\n\npercent of the refund received.\n\n\n\n\n10\n      The defendants do not appeal this issue.\n\n                                      -20-\n\f                        III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the orders of the\n\ndistrict court dismissing the complaint and allowing, in part, the\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment on their counterclaim.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -21-\n\f",

The plaintiff-appellant, Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (\"PREPA\"), is a public utility that generates and sells electric power to businesses and residents of Puerto Rico. The defendants-appellees are Action Refund, a North Carolina corporation engaged in the business of helping qualified entities obtain refunds from the United States Department of Energy (\"DOE\"), and its principal, Stanley K. Wallin.</p>\n<p>In September 2004, the parties signed a contract (hereinafter, \"the Contract\") which provided that Action Refund would act as a representative in PREPA's claim for refunds and be paid twenty percent of the total amount received. PREPA received a refund of $3 million and refused to pay the twenty percent fee, asserting that the Contract was invalid. In December 2006, PREPA filed the instant suit against Wallin and Action Refund, seeking a declaratory judgment to invalidate the Contract and damages for fraud, fraudulent inducement, and unconscionability.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> Wallin and Action Refund moved for summary judgment on only the declaratory judgment count. The court granted the motion and, <i>sua sponte,</i> dismissed the remaining three counts. Upon motion of the defendants, the court then granted summary judgment on their counterclaims: the court declared the Contract to be valid and binding and that the defendants were entitled to payment of the twenty percent fee. PREPA appealed. After careful consideration, we affirm the district court's orders.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In 1986, a federal multi-district litigation alleged that various producers and sellers of domestic crude oil and refined petroleum products were overcharging customers in violation of DOE regulations. The litigation resulted in a settlement of approximately $5 billion in overcharges from the offending parties. The DOE collected the funds and created a repayment process in which affected end-use consumers could submit claims to obtain a share of the overcharges. The refunds were disbursed in three rounds: the first in the late 1980s, the second in the mid-1990s, and the third in 2004.</p>\n<p>PREPA was among the affected end-use consumers; after submitting its claims in 1988, it received a refund of nearly $7 million in 1997. In May 2004, the DOE published procedures to obtain\" refunds in the third and final round. <i>See</i> Final Procedures for Distribution of Remaining Crude Oil Overcharge Refunds, 69 Fed. Reg. 29,300 (May 21, 2004). This round, limited to those \"successful claimants\" who had already received refunds, required claimants to submit the necessary paperwork on or before December 31, 2004, or otherwise forfeit all rights to the refund. <i>Id.</i> at 29,304. In addition to the publication in the Federal Register, written notice was to be sent to the approximately 3,400 eligible claimants. <i>Id.</i> PREPA asserts that it never received written notice from the DOE.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Since 1992, Wallin had assisted claimants in obtaining petroleum refunds. Through a subcontracting relationship with a refund claimant company, PBA Tax Accounting, Inc., Wallin contacted companies that qualified for the DOE refund program and offered to help prepare and submit the necessary documentation. Sometime in 1993, he learned that PREPA's application was still pending and offered to help facilitate the refund process. PREPA and PBA signed a contract providing that PBA would receive a service fee of ten percent of the total refund amount in return for its services. The relationship soured in 1997 when PREPA received the nearly $7 million refund check and refused to pay PBA. The parties settled the dispute for $250,000 in October 1998.</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2004, Wallin, now the sole proprietor of Action Refund, discovered that PREPA had not claimed its third-round refund. Wallin contacted PREPA and offered to assist in the refund process. On August 6, 2004, he submitted a written proposal for services as well as a proposed contract. The proposal authorized Action Refund to act as PREPA's representative. In return for providing information and services about refunds, Action Refund was to receive twenty percent of the money. Various employees at PREPA, including its legal department, reviewed the proposed contract. They asked for, and received, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> additional information about Wallin and Action Refund. At no time did either party discuss the prior relationship between PREPA and PBA. PREPA proposed the addition of a paragraph limiting Action Refund's authorization to one year. Wallin agreed and the Contract was executed by the parties on September 20 and 21, 2004.</p>\n<p>On October 4, 2004, Wallin submitted PREPA's verification documentation to the DOE and made various follow-up communications. In January 2005, the DOE contacted PREPA and requested that it submit a verification form which was identical to the one submitted by Wallin in October. On March 28, 2006, PREPA received a refund check for $3 million. Wallin demanded the twenty percent fee described in the contract and PREPA refused.</p>\n<p>PREPA filed the instant suit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico against Wallin and Action Refund on December 16, 2005 on the basis of federal diversity jurisdiction, seeking: a declaratory judgment establishing that the Contract is void and invalid (Count One) and damages for fraud in the inducement, fraud, and unconscionability (Counts Two, Three, and Four, respectively). The defendants answered and filed a counterclaim seeking their own declaratory judgment establishing the validity of the Contract, by which Action Refund is entitled to twenty percent of the refund, and damages for the breach. Following discovery, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to Count One only. PREPA opposed the motion. On December 29, 2006, the district court allowed the defendants' motion for summary judgment on Count One and <i>sua sponte</i> dismissed PREPA's remaining three counts, leaving only the defendants' counterclaims.</p>\n<p>Two months later, the defendants moved for summary judgment on their counterclaims. PREPA opposed the motion and asserted that the district court's <i>sua sponte</i> dismissal of Counts Two, Three, and Four of its complaint was improper. On March 15, 2007, the district court issued an order giving PREPA \"ten days to oppose the summary disposition of its claims, and said response must be filed with the Court on or before March 29, 2007.\" <i>PREPA v. Action Refund,</i> No. 05-2302 (D.P.R. Mar. 15, 2007) (order giving PREPA ten days to oppose disposition). In response, PREPA filed a motion to vacate the December 29 dismissal of its complaint. On March 30, 2007, the district court entered an order and final judgment allowing, in part,<sup>[2]</sup> the defendants' motion for summary judgment on its counterclaims and denying PREPA's motion to vacate the December judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo,</i> and the record is evaluated in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, indulging all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. <i>See </i><i>Chao v. Hotel Oasis, Inc.,</i> 493 F.3d 26, 33 (1st Cir.2007); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.</p>\n<p>On appeal, PREPA challenges the district court's decision on procedural and substantive grounds. It asserts that the district court erred in entering summary judgment <i>sua sponte</i> on Counts Two, Three, and Four, without providing sufficient notice. It also contends that, irrespective of the notice issue, the evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> on the record demonstrates that there are genuine issues of material fact with respect to all counts as well as the counterclaims.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Count One: Declaratory Judgment</i></p>\n<p>Count One of the complaint seeks a declaratory judgment establishing that the Contract is void and invalid for lack of consideration. Specifically, PREPA asserts that the DOE refund was not obtained through \"any information or work by Action Refund.\" The district court allowed the defendants' motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p>We begin with the requirements for a valid contract under Puerto Rico law:<sup>[3]</sup> (1) consent of the parties, (2) a definite object of the contract, and (3) consideration. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3391 (2004). PREPA alleges that the contract lacked consideration because it was already entitled to the refund without any further action on the part of the defendants.<sup>[4]</sup> The allegation stems from PREPA's realization that Action Refund had only completed a simple, one-page form to obtain the refund. PREPA contends that the form is one that could easily have been completed without Action Refund and, therefore, there was no consideration. We disagree.</p>\n<p>The Contract, signed by both parties, provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>1. I hereby authorize Action Refund to act as our representative in the claim for Petroleum Refunds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. Action Refund will provide information and services about refunds regarding petroleum and petroleum product overcharges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. All refunds and interest realized in our favor as a result of the information and work performed by Action Refund will be sent directly to [PREPA].</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4. All refunds realized will be shared as follows: Action Refund will receive 20% of an amount equal to the total amount received and it is understood no other cost or fees will be paid to Action Refund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>5. Upon `receipt of the refund check [PREPA] will remit the appropriate amount of refund due to Action Refund within seven working days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>6. This authorization is effective for one year commencing on the date of September 21, 2004.</blockquote>\n<p>The Contract thus specified that in return for successfully obtaining a crude oil refund on behalf of PREPA, Action Refund <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> would receive twenty percent of the refund.<sup>[5]</sup> Action Refund's promise to act on behalf of PREPA and render services necessary to obtain the refund is consideration for the Contract. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3431 (\"[the] promise of a thing or services by the other party is understood as a consideration\").</p>\n<p>PREPA's related argument that the consideration is inadequate because those services amounted only to the filing of a single piece of paperis similarly unavailing. A general principle of contract law provides that \"courts will not inquire into the adequacy of consideration in an agreed-upon exchange,\" unless that consideration is \"`so grossly inadequate as to shock the conscience of the court.'\" <i>Kenda Corp., Inc. v. Pot O'Gold Money Leagues, Inc.,</i> 329 F.3d 216, 229 (1st Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). We do not believe, taking into account the facts of this case, that the promise of services to obtain a $3 million refund in return for a twenty percent fee can be considered so grossly inadequate as to shock the conscience of the court. Moreover, the parties in this case are sophisticated business entities who engaged in arms-length negotiations. Given that they bargained and contracted for consideration terms which they deemed to be sufficient (and are sufficient under the law), we are loathe, on appeal, to \"evaluate the relative adequacy of the consideration or to reweigh the soundness of the parties' judgments.\" <i>In re Newport Plaza Assocs., L.P.,</i> 985 F.2d 640, 647 (1st Cir. 1993). Accordingly, the district court appropriately entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Count One of the complaint.</p>\n<p>C. <i>Counts Two Through Four: Fraud and Unconscionability</i></p>\n<p>1. <i>Procedural Issues</i></p>\n<p>After its summary dismissal of Count One, the district court went on to dismiss the remaining three claims without providing prior notice to the parties. The district court explained:</p>\n<blockquote>Though Count [One] is titled and focuses on seeking a declaratory judgment from the Court due to lack of consideration, [PREPA] also draws from its other counts, namely its fraud and fraud in the inducement counts, to support its arguments. Consequently, the Court here evaluates whether summary judgment is appropriate for each of Plaintiff's claims.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Puerto Rico Electric Power Auth. v. Action Refund,</i> 472 F.Supp.2d 133, 135 n. 1 (D.P.R.2006) (\"<i>PREPA I</i>\").</p>\n<p>It is without question that district courts, in appropriate circumstances, are entitled to enter summary judgment <i>sua sponte. See </i><i>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,</i> 477 U.S. 317, 326, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); <i>accord </i><i>Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc.,</i> 89 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir.1996). In an effort to limit \"the unfairness lurking in this approach,\" <i>Sánchez v. Triple-S Mgmt. Corp.,</i> 492 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2007), we have required two conditions prior to the district court's exercise of such a right:</p>\n<blockquote>First, the discovery process \"must be sufficiently advanced that the parties have enjoyed a reasonable opportunity to glean the material facts.\" Second, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> the district court must provide \"the targeted party appropriate notice and a chance to present its evidence on the essential elements of the claim or defense.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Berkovitz,</i> 89 F.3d at 29). There is no dispute that the first <i>Berkovitz</i> requirement is satisfied: the parties had completed discovery and had even filed pretrial memoranda when the district court ruled on the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Count One. The district court, however, failed to give any notice of its intention to enter summary judgment on the other three counts of the complaint.</p>\n<p>We have previously observed that a failure to provide adequate notice is not necessarily reversible error requiring a remand to the district court. <i>See </i><i>Vives v. Fajardo,</i> 472 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir.2007) (finding that lack of notice was not reversible error where appealing party could not demonstrate prejudice) (citing <i>Ward v. Utah,</i> 398 F.3d 1239, 1245-46 (10th Cir. 2005); <i>Bridgeway Corp. v. Citibank,</i> 201 F.3d 134, 139-40 (2d Cir.2000); <i>Yashon v. Gregory,</i> 737 F.2d 547, 552 (6th Cir.1984)); <i>see also </i><i>O'Hara v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 508 F.3d 753, 763-64 (5th Cir.2007) (applying a harmless error exception to the notice requirement); <i>Gibson v. Mayor &amp; Council of the City of Wilmington,</i> 355 F.3d 215, 219 (3d Cir.2004) (recognizing a narrow exception to the notice requirement where the record is fully developed, the issue is purely legal, and there is no prejudice to the parties). Evidence that the appealing party was procedurally prejudiced as a result of the failure to provide notice before <i>sua sponte</i> dismissal requires reversal. If, however, the appellant cannot demonstrate such prejudiceby establishing that it was unable to present evidence in support of its position as a result of the unfair surprise the failure to provide notice is harmless error and a remand would be futile.<sup>[6]</sup><i>See </i><i>Vives,</i> 472, F.3d at 22.</p>\n<p>Our inquiry is focused on whether PREPA was procedurally prejudiced by the lack of notice. In the summary judgment order, the district court explained the appropriateness of summary judgment for <i>all</i> of the counts in the complaint because PREPA drew from those other counts to support its arguments. <i>PREPA I,</i> 472 F.Supp.2d at 135 n. 1. Specifically, PREPA presented arguments and supporting evidence in support of its fraud claims in its opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the declaratory judgment count. Even on appeal, PREPA fuses the counts together and alleges that the district court improperly granted summary judgment on Count One because the defendants acted fraudulently.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>The procedural posture of this case is further complicated by subsequent orders by the district court. Following the court's dismissal of the complaint, the defendants moved for summary judgment on their counterclaim. As part of its opposition to the motion, PREPA argued that the court's <i>sua sponte</i> summary dismissal of its entire complaint, without proper notice, was contrary to Rule 56 and a violation of due process. In response, on March 15, 2007, the district court ordered PREPA to file an opposition to the summary disposition of the claims within ten <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> days. On March 29, 2007, PREPA filed a motion to set aside judgment in which it asserted that genuine issues of material fact preclude the entry of summary judgment on all counts.</p>\n<p>PREPA's motion to set aside judgment provides us with a unique opportunity to review what, if any, additional information PREPA was prevented from presenting to the court as a result of the lack of notice.<sup>[8]</sup> A comparison between PREPA's filings on November 22 (opposition to summary judgment) and March 29 (motion to set aside judgment) reveals indistinguishable arguments regarding numerous allegedly fraudulent misrepresentations by Wallin, accompanied by several exhibits and deposition excerpts in support of those allegations. PREPA points to no additional material evidence that it would otherwise have presented to the court had it been given notice that the court was considering its fraud and fraudulent inducement claims. Therefore, with respect to Counts Two and Three (fraudulent inducement and fraud, respectively), PREPA is unable to demonstrate procedural prejudice as a result of the lack of notice.</p>\n<p>PREPA also fails to show prejudice with respect to Count Four, unconscionability. According to both the complaint and PREPA's motion to vacate judgment, this count is based on Wallin's allegedly \"unreasonable coerc[ion of PREPA] into agreeing to the 20% commission fee,\" based on Wallin's alleged misrepresentations about the length and complexity of the process. The arguments and evidence PREPA would have proffered in support of its arguments are the same as those, submitted to the court in its November opposition filings. As PREPA failed to demonstrate that it was procedurally precluded from providing evidence in support of its fraud claims, PREPA is likewise unable to make the same showing for its unconscionability claim.</p>\n<p>Any error by the district court in considering PREPA's additional claims on summary judgment was harmless. PREPA placed those claims at issue by raising them in its November reply brief to the defendants' motion for summary judgment, to which they attached numerous exhibits. When given the opportunity to demonstrate prejudice for the <i>sua sponte</i> dismissal, PREPA reasserted the same arguments and failed to identify evidence which it was precluded from presenting in support of its claims. Under these unique circumstances, PREPA was afforded an adequate opportunity to present the evidence in support of its claim.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Substantive Issues</i></p>\n<p>On summary disposition, we take the facts as they appear in the record and draw inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <i>Ortiz-Piñero v. Rivera-Arroyo,</i> 84 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir.1996). Under Puerto Rico law, the party alleging fraud has the burden of demonstrating: (1) a false representation by the defendant; (2) the plaintiffs reasonable and foreseeable reliance thereon; (3) injury to the plaintiff as a result of the reliance; and (4) an intent to defraud. <i>See </i><i>Microsoft Corp. v. Computer Warehouse,</i> 83 F.Supp.2d 256, 262 (D.P.R.2000); <i>see also</i> 31 L.P.R.A. § 3408. The applicable Puerto Rico contract law regarding fraud has a strong underlying presumption in favor of good faith and honesty; the party alleging fraud has the burden of presenting evidence which is \"strong, clear, unchallengeable, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> convincing, and conclusive, since a mere preponderance of the evidence is not sufficient to establish the existence of fraud in [Puerto Rico].\" <i>Prado Álvarez v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,</i> 313 F.Supp.2d 61, 77 (D.P.R.2004) (quoting <i>F.C. Imports, Inc. v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston, N.A.,</i> 816 F.Supp. 78, 87 (D.P.R.1993)), <i>aff'd,</i> 405 F.3d 36 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>In Counts Two and Three, PREPA alleges that Wallin, on behalf of Action Refund, made various misrepresentations regarding the necessity of retaining Action Refund's services. In its filings, PREPA elaborates on those allegations: (1) Wallin fraudulently represented that the process was complex and tedious despite knowing that it involved only a one-page verification document; and (2) `Wallin failed to notify PREPA of their prior, business relationship.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>After review of the record, we conclude that PREPA cannot present strong and unchallenged evidence which establishes the existence of fraud. On the contrary, the evidence demonstrates that the allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation are challenged vigorously by the defendants. Moreover, PREPA's fraud claims fail for lack of reasonable reliance. <i>See Wadsworth Inc., Schwarz-Nin,</i> 951 F.Supp. 314, 323 (D.P.R.1996) (\"[T]he unreasonableness of the plaintiffs reliance may be regarded as sufficient evidence that he did not in fact rely upon the claimed false representation.\" (citing <i>F.C. Imports,</i> 816 F.Supp. at 87)). Puerto Rico law places little weight on a sophisticated and experienced business party's assertion of unknowing reliance. <i>See Ramírez, Segal &amp; Látimer v. Rigual,</i> 23 P.R. Offic. Trans. 156, 166, 123 D.P.R. 161 (1989) (finding that the parties were \"savvy businessmen\" and \"persons well versed in business and financial matters\" and concluding that they must have been aware of the possible outcome of the contract's terms); <i>Planned Credit of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Page,</i> 3 P.R. Offic. Trans. 341, 355 (1975) (looking at the plaintiff's education and business experience in rejecting the claim that he was deceived and induced into the transaction), <i>cited with approval in Wadsworth,</i> 951 F.Supp. at 325. Given the business sophistication of PREPA and the review of the Contract by its own legal department, the publicly available information regarding the claim application process, and PREPA's decision not to add specific contractual terms regarding the amount or type of work expected from Action Refund, any reliance upon the alleged misrepresentation is not reasonable.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we reject PREPA's argument that the defendants committed fraud by failing to inform PREPA of Wallin's prior relationship with PREPA. This makes little sense from either a legal or business perspective. Wallin's allegedly \"prior contentious relationship\" was not hidden from PREPA; in fact, that relationship had been with PREPA itself. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Josleyn,</i> 206 F.3d 144, 159 (1st Cir.2000) (explaining that knowledge obtained by an employee in the course of his work and within his scope of authority is imputed to the employer company). To impose a duty on the defendants to disclose information known to PREPA <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> through its employees would effectively fault them for PREPA's own deficiencies in institutional knowledge. Thus, as a matter of law, PREPA fails to meet the standard for fraud under Puerto Rico law.</p>\n<p>Given the facts of this case, PREPA's fourth claim, unconscionability, is disposed of quickly. Unconscionability is a traditional, equitable remedy which will void an otherwise legally valid contract. <i>See</i> 8 <i>Williston on Contracts,</i> § 18:1 (4th ed.2007). Puerto Rico law recognizes such judicial intervention where a contract exhibits an \"excessively onerous quality that reaches the point of bad faith, and defeats those rules of collective conduct that must be observed by every honest and loyal conscience.\" <i>López de Victoria v. Rodríguez,</i> 13 P.R. Offic. Trans. 341, 349, 113 D.P.R. 265 (1982); <i>see also Casera Foods, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 8</i> P.R. Offic. Trans. 914, 108 D.P.R. 850 (1979) (applying an equitable remedy when an unforeseeable change of circumstances alters the contract into an objectively unfair one). This is not such a case. PREPA, a billion-dollar utility freely signed the Contract after several weeks of review by its own legal department <i>Cf. Riesett v. W.B. Doner &amp;</i> Co., 293 F.3d 164, 173 (4th Cir. 2002) (\"The unconscionability doctrine has no application to contracts . . . which were entered into by sophisticated parties who bargained at arms' length.\"). Therefore, the district court properly concluded that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p>D. <i>Defendants' Counterclaims</i></p>\n<p>Lastly, PREPA contends that the district court erred in granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment on its counterclaims. The defendants sought a declaratory judgment establishing the validity of the contract and an award of interest, fees, and costs. The district court concluded that the Contract was valid and that Action Refund was entitled to payment pursuant to the Contract's terms, but denied the request for interest, fees, and costs. The court concluded that the Contract made no stipulation or reference to interest and there was no evidence of unreasonable litigiousness to justify the imposition of fees and costs.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>The defendants' counterclaim for declaratory judgment is effectively the reverse of the plaintiffs claim in Count One. Thus, for all of the reasons outlined above, we affirm the district court's determination that the Contract is valid and binding, and in accordance with its terms, Action Refund is `entitled to twenty percent of the refund received.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the orders of the district court dismissing the complaint and allowing, in part, the defendants' motion for summary judgment on their counterclaim.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[**]  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  It appears that the DOE mailed PREPA's notice to a San Juan Post Office Box address in the care of the attorney who had filed the original refund application in 1988; he was no longer associated with PREPA in 2004.</p>\n<p>[2]  The district court's order denied the defendants' motion seeking pre-judgment interest and attorneys' fees.</p>\n<p>[3]  Because this case is brought under diversity jurisdiction, we consider all of PREPA's claims under Puerto Rico contract law. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cabán Hernández v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.,</i> 486 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[4]  Count One alleges invalidity of the Contract for lack of consideration. However, in its opposition to summary judgment on this count (as well as in its brief on appeal), PREPA contends that the Contract is also invalid for lack of consent because of fraud or \"dolo.\" Given the complaint's failure to make this allegation in Count One, much less meet the Rule 9(b) particularity requirement for allegations of \"dolo\" involving fraud, <i>see </i><i>Generadora De Electricidad Del Caribe, Inc. v. Foster Wheeler Corp.,</i> 92 F.Supp.2d 8, 20 (D.P.R.2000), we will discuss fraud only within Counts Two and Three. We note, however, that the lack of consent argument is unpersuasive. It is hard to see how PREPA, a sophisticated and experienced corporation with a legal department who reviewed the Contract, was a victim of deceit in this case. <i>See </i><i>Raytheon-Catalytic, Inc. v. Gulf Chem. Corp.,</i> 959 F.Supp. 100, 109 (D.P.R.1997) (finding that a \"person's education, his social and economic status, his relations, and the type of business in which he is engaged are significant when trying to determine the existence of `dolus' that would void his consent\").</p>\n<p>[5]  While PREPA automatically qualified for the refund, the Federal Register Notice makes clear that without further proactive steps by PREPA before the December 2004 deadline, it would not have been eligible to obtain the final refund. In September 2004, when the parties signed the Contract, no submission to the DOE entitled PREPA to a third-round refund. In fact, the record indicates that as of the December 31, 2004 deadline, no forms were filed by or on behalf of PREPA other than that submitted by Wallin and Action Refund.</p>\n<p>[6]  Given the risk of unfairness and the low cost of providing notice, we do not encourage the practice of <i>sua sponte</i> summary dismissal. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Bridgeway Corp. v. Citibank,</i> 201 F.3d 134, 139 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>[7]  In its brief, PREPA asserts that the contract is invalid because the defendants \"misrepresented and omitted material facts that illicitly induced PREPA officials to agree to the 2004 Contract.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  We need not determine whether a district court can cure procedural prejudice resulting from lack of notice through this kind of post-dismissal order because no prejudice occurred in this case.</p>\n<p>[9]  The defendants also contend that the allegations of fraud were not asserted with sufficient particularity in the complaint. At oral argument, PREPA informed the court that it had sought to amend its complaint, but the district\" court denied the request and ordered the parties to submit statements describing the parties' prior relationship. In light of our conclusion that the district court properly dismissed the claims, we need not reach the issue of sufficiency of the allegations under the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 9(b) heightened pleading standard.</p>\n<p>[10]  The defendants do not appeal this issue.</p>\n\n</div>",

The plaintiff-appellant, Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (\"PREPA\"), is a public utility that generates and sells electric power to businesses and residents of Puerto Rico. The defendants-appellees are Action Refund, a North Carolina corporation engaged in the business of helping qualified entities obtain refunds from the United States Department of Energy (\"DOE\"), and its principal, Stanley K. Wallin.</p>\n<p>In September 2004, the parties signed a contract (hereinafter, \"the Contract\") which provided that Action Refund would act as a representative in PREPA's claim for refunds and be paid twenty percent of the total amount received. PREPA received a refund of $3 million and refused to pay the twenty percent fee, asserting that the Contract was invalid. In December 2006, PREPA filed the instant suit against Wallin and Action Refund, seeking a declaratory judgment to invalidate the Contract and damages for fraud, fraudulent inducement, and unconscionability.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> Wallin and Action Refund moved for summary judgment on only the declaratory judgment count. The court granted the motion and, <i>sua sponte,</i> dismissed the remaining three counts. Upon motion of the defendants, the court then granted summary judgment on their counterclaims: the court declared the Contract to be valid and binding and that the defendants were entitled to payment of the twenty percent fee. PREPA appealed. After careful consideration, we affirm the district court's orders.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In 1986, a federal multi-district litigation alleged that various producers and sellers of domestic crude oil and refined petroleum products were overcharging customers in violation of DOE regulations. The litigation resulted in a settlement of approximately $5 billion in overcharges from the offending parties. The DOE collected the funds and created a repayment process in which affected end-use consumers could submit claims to obtain a share of the overcharges. The refunds were disbursed in three rounds: the first in the late 1980s, the second in the mid-1990s, and the third in 2004.</p>\n<p>PREPA was among the affected end-use consumers; after submitting its claims in 1988, it received a refund of nearly $7 million in 1997. In May 2004, the DOE published procedures to obtain\" refunds in the third and final round. <i>See</i> Final Procedures for Distribution of Remaining Crude Oil Overcharge Refunds, 69 Fed. Reg. 29,300 (May 21, 2004). This round, limited to those \"successful claimants\" who had already received refunds, required claimants to submit the necessary paperwork on or before December 31, 2004, or otherwise forfeit all rights to the refund. <i>Id.</i> at 29,304. In addition to the publication in the Federal Register, written notice was to be sent to the approximately 3,400 eligible claimants. <i>Id.</i> PREPA asserts that it never received written notice from the DOE.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Since 1992, Wallin had assisted claimants in obtaining petroleum refunds. Through a subcontracting relationship with a refund claimant company, PBA Tax Accounting, Inc., Wallin contacted companies that qualified for the DOE refund program and offered to help prepare and submit the necessary documentation. Sometime in 1993, he learned that PREPA's application was still pending and offered to help facilitate the refund process. PREPA and PBA signed a contract providing that PBA would receive a service fee of ten percent of the total refund amount in return for its services. The relationship soured in 1997 when PREPA received the nearly $7 million refund check and refused to pay PBA. The parties settled the dispute for $250,000 in October 1998.</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2004, Wallin, now the sole proprietor of Action Refund, discovered that PREPA had not claimed its third-round refund. Wallin contacted PREPA and offered to assist in the refund process. On August 6, 2004, he submitted a written proposal for services as well as a proposed contract. The proposal authorized Action Refund to act as PREPA's representative. In return for providing information and services about refunds, Action Refund was to receive twenty percent of the money. Various employees at PREPA, including its legal department, reviewed the proposed contract. They asked for, and received, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> additional information about Wallin and Action Refund. At no time did either party discuss the prior relationship between PREPA and PBA. PREPA proposed the addition of a paragraph limiting Action Refund's authorization to one year. Wallin agreed and the Contract was executed by the parties on September 20 and 21, 2004.</p>\n<p>On October 4, 2004, Wallin submitted PREPA's verification documentation to the DOE and made various follow-up communications. In January 2005, the DOE contacted PREPA and requested that it submit a verification form which was identical to the one submitted by Wallin in October. On March 28, 2006, PREPA received a refund check for $3 million. Wallin demanded the twenty percent fee described in the contract and PREPA refused.</p>\n<p>PREPA filed the instant suit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico against Wallin and Action Refund on December 16, 2005 on the basis of federal diversity jurisdiction, seeking: a declaratory judgment establishing that the Contract is void and invalid (Count One) and damages for fraud in the inducement, fraud, and unconscionability (Counts Two, Three, and Four, respectively). The defendants answered and filed a counterclaim seeking their own declaratory judgment establishing the validity of the Contract, by which Action Refund is entitled to twenty percent of the refund, and damages for the breach. Following discovery, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to Count One only. PREPA opposed the motion. On December 29, 2006, the district court allowed the defendants' motion for summary judgment on Count One and <i>sua sponte</i> dismissed PREPA's remaining three counts, leaving only the defendants' counterclaims.</p>\n<p>Two months later, the defendants moved for summary judgment on their counterclaims. PREPA opposed the motion and asserted that the district court's <i>sua sponte</i> dismissal of Counts Two, Three, and Four of its complaint was improper. On March 15, 2007, the district court issued an order giving PREPA \"ten days to oppose the summary disposition of its claims, and said response must be filed with the Court on or before March 29, 2007.\" <i>PREPA v. Action Refund,</i> No. 05-2302 (D.P.R. Mar. 15, 2007) (order giving PREPA ten days to oppose disposition). In response, PREPA filed a motion to vacate the December 29 dismissal of its complaint. On March 30, 2007, the district court entered an order and final judgment allowing, in part,<sup>[2]</sup> the defendants' motion for summary judgment on its counterclaims and denying PREPA's motion to vacate the December judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo,</i> and the record is evaluated in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, indulging all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. <i>See </i><i>Chao v. Hotel Oasis, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202819\"><a href=\"/opinion/202819/chao-v-hotel-oasis-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.2007); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.</p>\n<p>On appeal, PREPA challenges the district court's decision on procedural and substantive grounds. It asserts that the district court erred in entering summary judgment <i>sua sponte</i> on Counts Two, Three, and Four, without providing sufficient notice. It also contends that, irrespective of the notice issue, the evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> on the record demonstrates that there are genuine issues of material fact with respect to all counts as well as the counterclaims.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Count One: Declaratory Judgment</i></p>\n<p>Count One of the complaint seeks a declaratory judgment establishing that the Contract is void and invalid for lack of consideration. Specifically, PREPA asserts that the DOE refund was not obtained through \"any information or work by Action Refund.\" The district court allowed the defendants' motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p>We begin with the requirements for a valid contract under Puerto Rico law:<sup>[3]</sup> (1) consent of the parties, (2) a definite object of the contract, and (3) consideration. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3391 (2004). PREPA alleges that the contract lacked consideration because it was already entitled to the refund without any further action on the part of the defendants.<sup>[4]</sup> The allegation stems from PREPA's realization that Action Refund had only completed a simple, one-page form to obtain the refund. PREPA contends that the form is one that could easily have been completed without Action Refund and, therefore, there was no consideration. We disagree.</p>\n<p>The Contract, signed by both parties, provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>1. I hereby authorize Action Refund to act as our representative in the claim for Petroleum Refunds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. Action Refund will provide information and services about refunds regarding petroleum and petroleum product overcharges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. All refunds and interest realized in our favor as a result of the information and work performed by Action Refund will be sent directly to [PREPA].</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4. All refunds realized will be shared as follows: Action Refund will receive 20% of an amount equal to the total amount received and it is understood no other cost or fees will be paid to Action Refund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>5. Upon `receipt of the refund check [PREPA] will remit the appropriate amount of refund due to Action Refund within seven working days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>6. This authorization is effective for one year commencing on the date of September 21, 2004.</blockquote>\n<p>The Contract thus specified that in return for successfully obtaining a crude oil refund on behalf of PREPA, Action Refund <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> would receive twenty percent of the refund.<sup>[5]</sup> Action Refund's promise to act on behalf of PREPA and render services necessary to obtain the refund is consideration for the Contract. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3431 (\"[the] promise of a thing or services by the other party is understood as a consideration\").</p>\n<p>PREPA's related argument that the consideration is inadequate because those services amounted only to the filing of a single piece of paperis similarly unavailing. A general principle of contract law provides that \"courts will not inquire into the adequacy of consideration in an agreed-upon exchange,\" unless that consideration is \"`so grossly inadequate as to shock the conscience of the court.'\" <i>Kenda Corp., Inc. v. Pot O'Gold Money Leagues, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200468\"><a href=\"/opinion/200468/kenda-corporation-v-germain/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">216</span></a></span>, 229 (1st Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). We do not believe, taking into account the facts of this case, that the promise of services to obtain a $3 million refund in return for a twenty percent fee can be considered so grossly inadequate as to shock the conscience of the court. Moreover, the parties in this case are sophisticated business entities who engaged in arms-length negotiations. Given that they bargained and contracted for consideration terms which they deemed to be sufficient (and are sufficient under the law), we are loathe, on appeal, to \"evaluate the relative adequacy of the consideration or to reweigh the soundness of the parties' judgments.\" <i>In re Newport Plaza Assocs., L.P.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600262\"><a href=\"/opinion/600262/in-re-newport-plaza-associates-lp-debtor-newport-plaza-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 647 (1st Cir. 1993).

Evidence that the appealing party was procedurally prejudiced as a result of the failure to provide notice before <i>sua sponte</i> dismissal requires reversal. If, however, the appellant cannot demonstrate such prejudiceby establishing that it was unable to present evidence in support of its position as a result of the unfair surprise the failure to provide notice is harmless error and a remand would be futile.<sup>[6]</sup><i>See </i><i>Vives,</i> 472, F.3d at 22.</p>\n<p>Our inquiry is focused on whether PREPA was procedurally prejudiced by the lack of notice. In the summary judgment order, the district court explained the appropriateness of summary judgment for <i>all</i> of the counts in the complaint because PREPA drew from those other counts to support its arguments. <i>PREPA I,</i> 472 F.Supp.2d at 135 n. 1. Specifically, PREPA presented arguments and supporting evidence in support of its fraud claims in its opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the declaratory judgment count. Even on appeal, PREPA fuses the counts together and alleges that the district court improperly granted summary judgment on Count One because the defendants acted fraudulently.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>The procedural posture of this case is further complicated by subsequent orders by the district court. Following the court's dismissal of the complaint, the defendants moved for summary judgment on their counterclaim. As part of its opposition to the motion, PREPA argued that the court's <i>sua sponte</i> summary dismissal of its entire complaint, without proper notice, was contrary to Rule 56 and a violation of due process. In response, on March 15, 2007, the district court ordered PREPA to file an opposition to the summary disposition of the claims within ten <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> days. On March 29, 2007, PREPA filed a motion to set aside judgment in which it asserted that genuine issues of material fact preclude the entry of summary judgment on all counts.</p>\n<p>PREPA's motion to set aside judgment provides us with a unique opportunity to review what, if any, additional information PREPA was prevented from presenting to the court as a result of the lack of notice.<sup>[8]</sup> A comparison between PREPA's filings on November 22 (opposition to summary judgment) and March 29 (motion to set aside judgment) reveals indistinguishable arguments regarding numerous allegedly fraudulent misrepresentations by Wallin, accompanied by several exhibits and deposition excerpts in support of those allegations. PREPA points to no additional material evidence that it would otherwise have presented to the court had it been given notice that the court was considering its fraud and fraudulent inducement claims. Therefore, with respect to Counts Two and Three (fraudulent inducement and fraud, respectively), PREPA is unable to demonstrate procedural prejudice as a result of the lack of notice.</p>\n<p>PREPA also fails to show prejudice with respect to Count Four, unconscionability. According to both the complaint and PREPA's motion to vacate judgment, this count is based on Wallin's allegedly \"unreasonable coerc[ion of PREPA] into agreeing to the 20% commission fee,\" based on Wallin's alleged misrepresentations about the length and complexity of the process. The arguments and evidence PREPA would have proffered in support of its arguments are the same as those, submitted to the court in its November opposition filings. As PREPA failed to demonstrate that it was procedurally precluded from providing evidence in support of its fraud claims, PREPA is likewise unable to make the same showing for its unconscionability claim.</p>\n<p>Any error by the district court in considering PREPA's additional claims on summary judgment was harmless. PREPA placed those claims at issue by raising them in its November reply brief to the defendants' motion for summary judgment, to which they attached numerous exhibits. When given the opportunity to demonstrate prejudice for the <i>sua sponte</i> dismissal, PREPA reasserted the same arguments and failed to identify evidence which it was precluded from presenting in support of its claims. Under these unique circumstances, PREPA was afforded an adequate opportunity to present the evidence in support of its claim.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Substantive Issues</i></p>\n<p>On summary disposition, we take the facts as they appear in the record and draw inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <i>Ortiz-Piñero v. Rivera-Arroyo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196764\"><a href=\"/opinion/196764/ortiz-pinero-v-rivera-arroyo/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.1996). Under Puerto Rico law, the party alleging fraud has the burden of demonstrating: (1) a false representation by the defendant; (2) the plaintiffs reasonable and foreseeable reliance thereon; (3) injury to the plaintiff as a result of the reliance; and (4) an intent to defraud. <i>See </i><i>Microsoft Corp. v.

The applicable Puerto Rico contract law regarding fraud has a strong underlying presumption in favor of good faith and honesty; the party alleging fraud has the burden of presenting evidence which is \"strong, clear, unchallengeable, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> convincing, and conclusive, since a mere preponderance of the evidence is not sufficient to establish the existence of fraud in [Puerto Rico].\" <i>Prado Álvarez v.

In its filings, PREPA elaborates on those allegations: (1) Wallin fraudulently represented that the process was complex and tedious despite knowing that it involved only a one-page verification document; and (2) `Wallin failed to notify PREPA of their prior, business relationship.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>After review of the record, we conclude that PREPA cannot present strong and unchallenged evidence which establishes the existence of fraud. On the contrary, the evidence demonstrates that the allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation are challenged vigorously by the defendants. Moreover, PREPA's fraud claims fail for lack of reasonable reliance. <i>See Wadsworth Inc., Schwarz-Nin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1381379\"><a href=\"/opinion/1381379/wadsworth-inc-v-schwarz-nin/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Imports,</i> 816 F.Supp. at 87)). Puerto Rico law places little weight on a sophisticated and experienced business party's assertion of unknowing reliance. <i>See Ramírez, Segal &amp; Látimer v. Rigual,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></span>, 166, 123 D.P.R. 161 (1989) (finding that the parties were \"savvy businessmen\" and \"persons well versed in business and financial matters\" and concluding that they must have been aware of the possible outcome of the contract's terms); <i>Planned Credit of Puerto Rico, Inc. v.

Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></span>, 355 (1975) (looking at the plaintiff's education and business experience in rejecting the claim that he was deceived and induced into the transaction), <i>cited with approval in Wadsworth,</i> 951 F.Supp. at 325. Given the business sophistication of PREPA and the review of the Contract by its own legal department, the publicly available information regarding the claim application process, and PREPA's decision not to add specific contractual terms regarding the amount or type of work expected from Action Refund, any reliance upon the alleged misrepresentation is not reasonable.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we reject PREPA's argument that the defendants committed fraud by failing to inform PREPA of Wallin's prior relationship with PREPA. This makes little sense from either a legal or business perspective. Wallin's allegedly \"prior contentious relationship\" was not hidden from PREPA; in fact, that relationship had been with PREPA itself. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Josleyn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767958\"><a href=\"/opinion/767958/united-states-v-dennis-r-josleyn-united-states-of-america-v-john-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span>, 159 (1st Cir.2000) (explaining that knowledge obtained by an employee in the course of his work and within his scope of authority is imputed to the employer company). To impose a duty on the defendants to disclose information known to PREPA <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> through its employees would effectively fault them for PREPA's own deficiencies in institutional knowledge. Thus, as a matter of law, PREPA fails to meet the standard for fraud under Puerto Rico law.</p>\n<p>Given the facts of this case, PREPA's fourth claim, unconscionability, is disposed of quickly. Unconscionability is a traditional, equitable remedy which will void an otherwise legally valid contract. <i>See</i> 8 <i>Williston on Contracts,</i> § 18:1 (4th ed.2007). Puerto Rico law recognizes such judicial intervention where a contract exhibits an \"excessively onerous quality that reaches the point of bad faith, and defeats those rules of collective conduct that must be observed by every honest and loyal conscience.\" <i>López de Victoria v. Rodríguez,</i> 1<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></span>, 349, 113 D.P.R. 265 (1982); <i>see also Casera Foods, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 8</i> P.R. Offic. Trans. 914, 108 D.P.R. 850 (1979) (applying an equitable remedy when an unforeseeable change of circumstances alters the contract into an objectively unfair one). This is not such a case. PREPA, a billion-dollar utility freely signed the Contract after several weeks of review by its own legal department <i>Cf. Riesett v. W.B. Doner &amp;</i> Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777965\"><a href=\"/opinion/777965/donald-f-riesett-v-wb-doner-company-doner-international-limited/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>, 173 (4th Cir. 2002) (\"The unconscionability doctrine has no application to contracts . . . which were entered into by sophisticated parties who bargained at arms' length.\"). Therefore, the district court properly concluded that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p>D. <i>Defendants' Counterclaims</i></p>\n<p>Lastly, PREPA contends that the district court erred in granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment on its counterclaims. The defendants sought a declaratory judgment establishing the validity of the contract and an award of interest, fees, and costs. The district court concluded that the Contract was valid and that Action Refund was entitled to payment pursuant to the Contract's terms, but denied the request for interest, fees, and costs. The court concluded that the Contract made no stipulation or reference to interest and there was no evidence of unreasonable litigiousness to justify the imposition of fees and costs.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>The defendants' counterclaim for declaratory judgment is effectively the reverse of the plaintiffs claim in Count One. Thus, for all of the reasons outlined above, we affirm the district court's determination that the Contract is valid and binding, and in accordance with its terms, Action Refund is `entitled to twenty percent of the refund received.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the orders of the district court dismissing the complaint and allowing, in part, the defendants' motion for summary judgment on their counterclaim.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[**]  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  It appears that the DOE mailed PREPA's notice to a San Juan Post Office Box address in the care of the attorney who had filed the original refund application in 1988; he was no longer associated with PREPA in 2004.</p>\n<p>[2]  The district court's order denied the defendants' motion seeking pre-judgment interest and attorneys' fees.</p>\n<p>[3]  Because this case is brought under diversity jurisdiction, we consider all of PREPA's claims under Puerto Rico contract law. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cabán Hernández v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202726\"><a href=\"/opinion/202726/caban-hernandez-v-phillip-morris-usa/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[4]  Count One alleges invalidity of the Contract for lack of consideration. However, in its opposition to summary judgment on this count (as well as in its brief on appeal), PREPA contends that the Contract is also invalid for lack of consent because of fraud or \"dolo.\" Given the complaint's failure to make this allegation in Count One, much less meet the Rule 9(b) particularity requirement for allegations of \"dolo\" involving fraud, <i>see </i><i>Generadora De Electricidad Del Caribe, Inc. v. Foster Wheeler Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2529701\"><a href=\"/opinion/2529701/generadora-de-electricidad-v-foster-wheeler-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 20 (D.P.R.2000), we will discuss fraud only within Counts Two and Three. We note, however, that the lack of consent argument is unpersuasive. It is hard to see how PREPA, a sophisticated and experienced corporation with a legal department who reviewed the Contract, was a victim of deceit in this case. <i>See </i><i>Raytheon-Catalytic, Inc. v. Gulf Chem. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2367404\"><a href=\"/opinion/2367404/raytheon-catalytic-inc-v-gulf-chemical-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 109 (D.P.R.1997) (finding that a \"person's education, his social and economic status, his relations, and the type of business in which he is engaged are significant when trying to determine the existence of `dolus' that would void his consent\").</p>\n<p>[5]  While PREPA automatically qualified for the refund, the Federal Register Notice makes clear that without further proactive steps by PREPA before the December 2004 deadline, it would not have been eligible to obtain the final refund. In September 2004, when the parties signed the Contract, no submission to the DOE entitled PREPA to a third-round refund. In fact, the record indicates that as of the December 31, 2004 deadline, no forms were filed by or on behalf of PREPA other than that submitted by Wallin and Action Refund.</p>\n<p>[6]  Given the risk of unfairness and the low cost of providing notice, we do not encourage the practice of <i>sua sponte</i> summary dismissal. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Bridgeway Corp. v. Citibank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767341\"><a href=\"/opinion/767341/bridgeway-corporation-v-citibank-doing-business-as-citicorp-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">201</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 139 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>[7]  In its brief, PREPA asserts that the contract is invalid because the defendants \"misrepresented and omitted material facts that illicitly induced PREPA officials to agree to the 2004 Contract.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  We need not determine whether a district court can cure procedural prejudice resulting from lack of notice through this kind of post-dismissal order because no prejudice occurred in this case.</p>\n<p>[9]  The defendants also contend that the allegations of fraud were not asserted with sufficient particularity in the complaint. At oral argument, PREPA informed the court that it had sought to amend its complaint, but the district\" court denied the request and ordered the parties to submit statements describing the parties' prior relationship. In light of our conclusion that the district court properly dismissed the claims, we need not reach the issue of sufficiency of the allegations under the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 9(b) heightened pleading standard.</p>\n<p>[10]  The defendants do not appeal this issue.</p>\n\n</div>",
