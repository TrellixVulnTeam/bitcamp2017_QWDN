Plaintiffs-appellants Iris\n\nEsther Taffanelli-Figueroa (\"Taffanelli\") and her son, Iván F.\n\nFuster-Taffanelli     (collectively,      \"Plaintiffs\"),1         appeal     the\n\ndistrict court's order dismissing their case with prejudice and its\n\nsubsequent denial of their motion for relief from judgment.                After\n\ncareful review, we reverse the dismissal and remand for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n                              I. Background\n\n           On March 11, 2004, Plaintiffs filed a civil rights action\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Puerto Rico Constitution against the\n\nPuerto   Rico   Department   of   Education   and    a   number   of   related\n\ndefendants (collectively, \"Defendants\").            A somewhat contentious\n\nand protracted period of discovery ensued, with numerous motions\n\nfor extensions of time, at least one motion to compel discovery,\n\nand a stay pending Taffanelli's intervening \"psychological crisis.\"\n\n           On December 15, 2005, counsel for Plaintiffs, Frank D.\n\nInserni, filed a motion requesting leave to withdraw, citing\n\n\"unappeasable differences.\" Inserni's motion also requested ninety\n\ndays for Plaintiffs to retain new counsel, given that the file in\n\nthe case was extensive and many Puerto Rico law firms would be\n\nclosed until at least mid-January for the holiday season. The same\n\nday, Inserni sent Plaintiffs a letter stating his intention to\n\n\n1\n   A third plaintiff, Taffanelli's daughter, Iris Janice Fuster-\nTaffanelli, requested that she be dismissed from the case with\nprejudice. The district court granted the motion.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fwithdraw due to, among other things, disagreement over litigation\n\ncosts.   He also informed Plaintiffs that he would release their\n\ncase file as soon as his motion was granted and he had been paid.\n\n           On   February    17,    2006,   the    district   court   granted\n\nInserni's motion to withdraw and ordered Plaintiffs to \"appear\n\nthrough new retained counsel or representing themselves no later\n\nthan March 1, 2006.\"        Noting that Taffanelli had known of the\n\nmotion to withdraw since mid-December, the court warned Plaintiffs\n\nthat   \"[f]ailure    to   comply   with    this   Order   shall   result   in\n\ndismissal, with prejudice.\"\n\n           Plaintiffs filed a pro se motion on March 1, 2006,\n\nrequesting an additional sixty days to obtain new representation.\n\nThey explained that they had difficulty finding new counsel due to\n\nthe \"complicated and voluminous\" nature of the case.\n\n           On March 8, 2006, the district court denied Plaintiffs'\n\nmotion for an extension of time by endorsed order.           The court then\n\nentered judgment, dismissing the action with prejudice on the\n\nground that Plaintiffs had failed to appear as required by the\n\ncourt's order of February 17.         On March 20, Plaintiffs filed a\n\nspecial appearance through a new attorney, and moved for relief\n\nfrom judgment.      Plaintiffs argued that they had been diligently\n\nseeking new representation, but that they had been unsuccessful\n\nbecause they did not have their case files until February 28, and\n\nno attorney would take their case without an opportunity to review\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthe files. The district court denied the motion without comment on\n\nApril 3, 2006.\n\n          Plaintiffs appeal the judgment against them and the order\n\ndenying their motion for relief from judgment.\n\n                   II. Dismissal with Prejudice\n\n          We have often affirmed a trial court's discretion to\n\ndismiss a case with prejudice for failure to comply with court\n\norders.   See, e.g., Torres-Vargas v. Pereira, 431 F.3d 389, 392\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).   However, we have also warned that dismissal with\n\nprejudice is a particularly harsh sanction, which should be imposed\n\nonly in extreme circumstances.   See Malot v. Dorado Beach Cottages\n\nAssocs., 478 F.3d 40, 43-44 (1st Cir. 2007); Estate of Solís-Rivera\n\nv. United States, 993 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1993).        We review a\n\ndistrict court's use of dismissal with prejudice as a sanction for\n\nabuse of discretion. See Benítez-García v. González-Vega, 468 F.3d\n\n1, 5 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          In this case, one simple fact compels us to reverse: The\n\ndistrict court dismissed the case with prejudice on the ground that\n\nPlaintiffs failed to comply with its order to appear by March 1,\n\n2006, even though Plaintiffs did appear by the stated deadline.\n\nThe order required that Plaintiffs appear either through another\n\nattorney or in representation of themselves.      Because Plaintiffs\n\nhad not yet retained new counsel, they filed a pro se motion, which\n\nstated that \"the purpose of this appearance is to comply with the\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fOrder [of February 17].\"     The filing of this motion constituted an\n\nappearance, as a matter of law, see Black's Law Dictionary 107 (8th\n\ned. 2004) (defining \"appearance\" as \"[a] coming into court as a\n\nparty . . . by formally participating in [the lawsuit] or by an\n\nanswer, demurrer, or motion\"); cf. United States v. $23,000 in U.S.\n\nCurrency, 356 F.3d 157, 164 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing with approval\n\n10A Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure § 2686 as\n\n\"noting   that   an   appearance   [for   purposes   of   Rule    55]   merely\n\n'involves some presentation or submission to the court.'\"), and\n\ntherefore the district court erred in dismissing the case in\n\naccordance with its prior warning.\n\n           Defendants argue that the court's order clearly meant for\n\nPlaintiffs to appear ready to prosecute their case, and that\n\nappearing to request additional time was a violation of the order.\n\nPerhaps that is what the district court intended, but the plain\n\nlanguage of the order merely required Plaintiffs to appear, which\n\nthey did. Moreover, in granting the attorney's motion to withdraw,\n\nthe court knew that Plaintiffs were without counsel.             Thus, if the\n\ncourt intended for the Plaintiffs to do more than just appear, it\n\nshould have made its intentions plain in the order.              Cf. Cintrón-\n\nLorenzo v. Departamento de Asuntos del Consumidor, 312 F.3d 522,\n\n526-27 (1st Cir. 2002) (acknowledging the principle of leniency\n\ntoward pro se plaintiffs, but declining to apply it where the\n\ncourt's warnings were plain).        Technically, Plaintiffs complied\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fwith the terms of the court's order, and it was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion to dismiss the case with prejudice for failure to\n\ncomply.      See Rosario-Urdaz v. Rivera-Hernández, 350 F.3d 219, 221\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (\"An error of law is, of course, an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\").\n\n                             III. Conclusion\n\n             We find that the district court abused its discretion in\n\nimposing on Plaintiffs one of the harshest sanctions available, on\n\nthe stated ground that Plaintiffs failed to comply with a court\n\norder warning them of the dire consequences of noncompliance, when\n\nin fact Plaintiffs had complied with the plain language of the\n\norder   in    question.   Because   we    reverse   the   judgment   against\n\nPlaintiffs on this ground and remand for further proceedings, we\n\nneed not address the denial of their motion for relief from\n\njudgment.\n\n             Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f",

Fuster-Taffanelli (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> appeal the district court's order dismissing their case with prejudice and its subsequent denial of their motion for relief from judgment. After careful review, we reverse the dismissal and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 11, 2004, Plaintiffs filed a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and the Puerto Rico Constitution against the Puerto Rico Department of Education and a number of related defendants (collectively, \"Defendants\"). A somewhat contentious and protracted period of discovery ensued, with numerous motions for extensions of time, at least one motion to compel discovery, and a stay pending Taffanelli's intervening \"psychological crisis.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 15, 2005, counsel for Plaintiffs, Frank D. Inserni, filed a motion requesting leave to withdraw, citing \"unappeasable differences.\" Inserni's motion also requested ninety days for Plaintiffs to retain new counsel, given that the file in the case was extensive and many Puerto Rico law firms would be closed until at least mid-January for the holiday season. The same day, Inserni sent Plaintiffs a letter stating his intention to withdraw due to, among other things, disagreement over litigation costs. He also informed Plaintiffs that he would release their case file as soon as his motion was granted and he had been paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 17, 2006, the district court granted Inserni's motion to withdraw and ordered Plaintiffs to \"appear through new retained counsel or representing themselves no later than March 1, 2006.\" Noting that Taffanelli had known of the motion to withdraw since mid-December, the court warned Plaintiffs that \"[f]ailure to comply with this Order shall result in dismissal, with prejudice.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs filed a pro se motion on March 1, 2006, requesting an additional sixty days to obtain new representation. They explained that they had difficulty finding new counsel due to the \"complicated and voluminous\" nature of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 8, 2006, the district court denied Plaintiffs' motion for an extension of time by endorsed order. The court then entered judgment, dismissing the action with prejudice on the ground that Plaintiffs had failed to appear as required by the court's order of February 17. On March 20, Plaintiffs filed a special appearance through a new attorney, and moved for relief from judgment. Plaintiffs argued that they had been diligently seeking new representation, but that they had been unsuccessful because they did not have their case files until February 28, and no attorney would take their case without an opportunity to review the files. The district court denied the motion without comment on April 3, 2006.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs appeal the judgment against them and the order denying their motion for relief from judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Dismissal with Prejudice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have often affirmed a trial court's discretion to dismiss a case with prejudice for failure to comply with court orders. <i>See, e.g., Torres-Vargas v. Pereira,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201971\"><a href=\"/opinion/201971/torres-vargas-v-pereira/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span>, 392 (1st Cir.2005). However, we have also warned that dismissal with prejudice is a particularly harsh sanction, which should be imposed only in extreme circumstances. <i>See Malot v. Dorado Beach Cottages Assocs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202644\"><a href=\"/opinion/202644/malot-v-dorado-beach-cottage/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 43-44 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Estate of Sol&#237;s-Rivera v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606360\"><a href=\"/opinion/606360/the-estate-of-jose-m-solis-rivera-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.1993). We review a district court's use of dismissal with prejudice as a sanction for abuse of discretion. <i>See Ben&#237;tez-Garc&#237;a v. Gonz&#225;lez-Vega,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, one simple fact compels us to reverse: The district court dismissed the case with prejudice on the ground that Plaintiffs failed to comply with its order to appear by March 1, 2006, even though Plaintiffs <i>did</i> appear by the stated deadline. The order required that Plaintiffs appear either through another attorney or in representation of themselves. Because Plaintiffs had not yet retained new counsel, they filed a pro se motion, which stated that \"the purpose of this appearance is to comply with the Order [of February 17].\" The filing of this motion constituted an appearance, as a matter of law, <i>see Black's Law Dictionary</i> 107 (8th ed.2004) (defining \"appearance\" as \"[a] coming into court as a party . . . by formally participating in [the lawsuit] or by an answer, demurrer, or motion\"); <i>cf. United States v. $23,000 in U.S. Currency,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200829\"><a href=\"/opinion/200829/united-states-v-rodriguez-barrientos/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 164 (1st Cir.2004) (citing with approval 10A Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> &#167; 2686 as \"noting that an appearance [for purposes of Rule 55] merely `involves some presentation or submission to the court.'\"), and therefore the district court erred in dismissing the case in accordance with its prior warning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the court's order clearly meant for Plaintiffs to appear ready to prosecute their case, and that appearing to request additional time was a violation of the order. Perhaps that is what the district court intended, but the plain language of the order merely required Plaintiffs to appear, which they did. Moreover, in granting the attorney's motion to withdraw, the court knew that Plaintiffs were without counsel. Thus, if the court intended for the Plaintiffs to do more than just appear, it should have made its intentions plain in the order. <i>Cf. Cintr&#243;n-Lorenzo v. Departamento de Asuntos del Consumidor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200239\"><a href=\"/opinion/200239/cintron-lorenzo-v-dept-of-consumer/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span>, 526-27 (1st Cir.2002) (acknowledging the principle of leniency toward pro se plaintiffs, but declining to apply it where the court's warnings were plain). Technically, Plaintiffs complied with the terms of the court's order, and it was an abuse of discretion to dismiss the case with prejudice for failure to comply. <i>See Rosario-Urdaz v. Rivera-Hern&#225;ndez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200743\"><a href=\"/opinion/200743/rosario-urdaz-v-rivera-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></a></span>, 221 (1st Cir.2003) (\"An error of law is, of course, an abuse of discretion.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the district court abused its discretion in imposing on Plaintiffs one of the harshest sanctions available, on the stated ground that Plaintiffs failed to comply with a court order warning them of the dire consequences of noncompliance, when in fact Plaintiffs had complied with the plain language of the order in question. Because we reverse the judgment against Plaintiffs on this ground and remand for further proceedings, we need not address the denial of their motion for relief from judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Reversed and remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A third plaintiff, Taffanelli's daughter, Iris Janice Fuster-Taffanelli, requested that she be dismissed from the case with prejudice.
