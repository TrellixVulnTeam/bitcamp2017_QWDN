Petitioner Resende Afonso Da Cunha appeals\n\nan order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming an\n\norder of removal against him and denying his motion to reopen.                  We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            Da Cunha, a citizen of Brazil, entered the United States\n\non a visitor visa in February, 2000 with permission to stay for six\n\nmonths.    He overstayed that visa.         Da Cunha was employed with the\n\nBestfoods    Baking   Company   (Bestfoods)     in       Vermont,    and   through\n\nBestfoods began the process of applying for an adjustment of status\n\nto become a lawful permanent resident.\n\n            There is a three-step process for an alien seeking to\n\nadjust his or her status based on employment.                     The first step\n\nrequires    the   alien's   employer    to   file    a    labor     certification\n\napplication.      See 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i)(1)(B)(ii).          After acquiring a\n\nvalid labor certification, the employer must then as a second step\n\nfile an I-140 form (Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker) on the\n\nalien's behalf.     See 8 U.S.C. § 1154.      Finally, the alien must file\n\nan I-485 form (Application for Adjustment of Status).                 See id.\n\n            Here, Da Cunha commenced the process with Bestfoods but\n\ndid not finish it.     On April 27, 2001, Bestfoods filed a Form ETA-\n\n750 on his behalf.        The Vermont Department of Labor1 assigned a\n\n\n1\n   In July 2005, the Vermont Department of Labor was formed by\nmerging the former Departments of Labor and Industry and Employment\n\n                                    -2-\n\f\"priority date\" of April 30, 2001 to the application.             On June 20,\n\n2001, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)2 served Da\n\nCunha with a Notice to Appear, charging that he was subject to\n\nremoval for overstaying his visa.          He was detained by the INS and,\n\nas    a   consequence,   was    terminated    from    his    employment    with\n\nBestfoods.     Bestfoods did not elect to further pursue the labor\n\ncertification process on Da Cunha's behalf.\n\n             In 2002, Da Cunha was employed by Silva's Donuts.             That\n\nemployer filed a new labor certification application and an I-140\n\non his behalf.     In April, 2004, the DOL approved the application,\n\nwhich had a priority date of September 25, 2002, and the I-140.\n\nThat priority date made him ineligible for an adjustment of status\n\nunder section 245(i) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, so\n\nthe   government   moved   to    pretermit    his    I-485   application    for\n\nadjustment of status.      See 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i)(B)(ii).\n\n             An alien applying for an adjustment of status as the\n\nbeneficiary of a labor certification petition must show that the\n\npetition (1) was properly filed pursuant to the regulations of the\n\nSecretary of Labor on or before April 30, 2001, and (2) was\n\n\nand Training.   For ease of understanding, we will refer to the\nVermont Department of Labor when referring to either of the former\nagencies.\n2\n  In March 2003, the functions of the INS were reorganized and\ntransferred to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Dacosta\nv. Gonzales, 449 F.3d 45, 47 n. 1 (1st Cir. 2006).        To avoid\nconfusion, we will use “INS” whether referring to the former INS or\nthe present DHS.\n\n                                     -3-\n\f\"approvable when filed.\"           8 C.F.R. § 245.10(a)(1)(i)(B).               An\n\napplicant meeting these criteria is \"grandfathered.\"                   Id.       A\n\ngrandfathered alien may apply for an adjustment of status through\n\na new employer using the earlier application's priority date.                See\n\n8   C.F.R.   §     245.10(a)(3)(2007).        Da   Cunha   argued   before      an\n\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\") that he was grandfathered by his first\n\nlabor certification application, and that his second application\n\nshould not be pretermitted.\n\n             The    government    argued    that   Da   Cunha's   first    labor\n\ncertification did not give him grandfathered status because that\n\nlabor certification was not \"approvable when filed\" as required by\n\n8 C.F.R. § 245.10(a)(1)(i)(B).        In support of this contention, the\n\ngovernment produced a July, 2001 letter from the Vermont Department\n\nof Labor to Da Cunha, indicating that Bestfoods was an \"inactive\"\n\nemployer.     The government also noted that Da Cunha's pay stubs\n\nlisted his employer as Charles Freihofer Baking, rather than\n\nBestfoods,    and    that   the   labor    certification   was    signed   by   a\n\nBestfoods supervisor, not by a more senior company official.\n\n             Da Cunha did not introduce evidence before the IJ to\n\nrefute the government's contention.\n\n             In March, 2005, the IJ concluded that Da Cunha’s first\n\nlabor certification was not approvable when filed because it\n\nreferenced an employer who was \"inactive\" at the time of filing.\n\nNoting that Da Cunha did not refute his employer's inactive status,\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthe IJ pretermitted his I-485 adjustment of status application and\n\ndenied Da Cunha voluntary departure as a matter of discretion.\n\n              Da Cunha appealed the decision to the BIA and also filed\n\na motion to reopen, requesting that the BIA remand his case to the\n\nIJ so the IJ could consider new evidence about whether he should be\n\n\"grandfathered\" under section 245(i). The BIA adopted and affirmed\n\nthe decision of the IJ.      The BIA also denied Da Cunha’s motion to\n\nreopen, finding that the documents he sought to admit were not new\n\nor previously unavailable.      This petition followed.\n\n                                      II.\n\n              Da Cunha argues that his first labor certification was\n\n\"approvable when filed\" and that the BIA’s denial of his motion to\n\nreopen was an abuse of discretion.3\n\n              As to his first argument, we review the IJ’s decision\n\nunder the substantial evidence standard.          Chreng v. Gonzales, 471\n\nF.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir. 2006).          Under this standard, the decision\n\nwill stand unless the record evidence would compel a reasonable\n\nfactfinder to find otherwise.         Pan v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 60, 61\n\n(1st   Cir.    2006).   Where   the    BIA   summarily   affirms   the   IJ’s\n\ndecision, we review the IJ’s decision directly.          Tota v. Gonzales,\n\n457 F.3d 161, 165 (1st Cir. 2006); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4)(2007).\n\n\n\n3\n   Defendant’s other arguments on appeal were never raised before\nthe BIA and thus are not properly before us. Molina De Massenet v.\nGonzales, 485 F.3d 661, 664 (1st Cir. 2007) (declining to review\nissues not raised before the BIA).\n\n                                      -5-\n\f            This case hinges on the meaning of \"approvable when\n\nfiled.\"     If Da Cunha's first labor certification was approvable\n\nwhen   filed,    its     priority    date    of    April    30,     2001   would    have\n\ngrandfathered Da Cunha such that he could subsequently be eligible\n\nto   undertake    the    three-step       labor    certification          process   with\n\nanother employer.        If it was not approvable when filed, then he is\n\nnot grandfathered and not eligible for an adjustment of status\n\nthrough   his    employment        with   Silva's    Donuts       because    his    2002\n\npriority date is too late under the regulations.                           8 C.F.R. §\n\n245.10(a)(1)(i)(B).\n\n            \"Approvable when filed\"               means     that,    at    the time of\n\nfiling, the qualifying application for labor certification was\n\n\"properly     filed,     meritorious        in    fact,    and    non-frivolous.\"\n\nEchevarria v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 2007); 8 C.F.R. §\n\n245.10(a)(3).      The burden is on the petitioner to show that his\n\napplication was approvable when filed. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(2).\n\n            We focus on the second prong, whether the application was\n\nmeritorious in fact.        We said in Echevarria that there need not be\n\na finding of fraud to support a conclusion that an application is\n\nnot meritorious in fact.           505 F.3d at 19 n. 3.          There, a finding of\n\n\"identified      gaps\"    in   a    petitioner's          application,      where   the\n\npetitioner had been an opportunity to explain the gaps but failed\n\nto do so, was sufficient to show that the application was not\n\nmeritorious in fact.        Id.\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f          Here, like in Echevarria, the IJ identified a specific\n\ndiscrepancy in the labor certification application:      Bestfoods'\n\n\"inactive\" status.   The Vermont Department of Labor indicated that\n\nBestfoods was an \"inactive\" employer, in that it was not paying\n\nunemployment taxes for its workers, at the time that Da Cunha’s\n\nfirst labor certification was filed.   The burden was on Da Cunha to\n\nprove that his first labor certification was properly filed, yet he\n\noffered no evidence before the IJ or the BIA to refute the inactive\n\nstatus of his employer.   In fact, Da Cunha was explicitly invited\n\nto send contrary evidence or an explanation as to why Bestfoods was\n\ninactive to the Vermont Department of Labor, but did not do so.\n\n          Because Da Cunha failed to offer an explanation for the\n\ndiscrepancy that satisfied the IJ, the IJ concluded that Da Cunha’s\n\nfirst labor certification was not \"approvable when filed\" because\n\nit was not meritorious in fact.    This conclusion is supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence.\n\n          We note that Da Cunha finds no refuge in the provision in\n\n8 C.F.R. § 1245.10(a)(3) that preserves an alien's grandfathered\n\nstatus if a \"petition that was properly filed on or before April\n\n30, 2001, and was approvable when filed, but was later withdrawn,\n\ndenied, or revoked due to circumstances that have arisen after the\n\ntime of filing [and] . . . the alien is otherwise eligible.\"\n\nBecause we conclude that his first labor certification was not\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fapprovable when filed, it does not matter if it was later revoked\n\ndue to circumstances that arose after April 30, 2001.\n\n                                   III.\n\n            We review the BIA’s denial of a motion to reopen or\n\nreconsider only for abuse of discretion. Abdullah v. Gonzales, 461\n\nF.3d 92, 99 (1st Cir. 2006).      This standard is highly deferential;\n\nfocusing on the rationality of the decision to deny reconsideration\n\nor reopening, not on the merits of the underlying claim.        Id.    “An\n\nabuse of discretion will be found where the BIA misinterprets the\n\nlaw,   or   acts   either   arbitrarily   or   capriciously.”   Wang   v.\n\nAshcroft, 367 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 2004).         Motions to reopen are\n\npermitted only where they present new evidence that is material and\n\nwas previously unavailable.      Orehhova v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 48, 52\n\n(1st Cir. 2005); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1)(2007).\n\n            Here, the documents submitted to the BIA with Da Cunha’s\n\nmotion to reopen were not new, material and previously unavailable.\n\nIn particular, the company report and the news story pertaining to\n\nwhen Bestfoods was purchased by another company were previously\n\navailable.    Thus, there was no abuse of discretion in denying Da\n\nCunha’s motion to reopen.\n\n                                   IV.\n\n            Da Cunha’s petition for review is denied.\n\n            So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f",

Da   Cunha   argued   before      an\n\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\") that he was grandfathered by his first\n\nlabor certification application, and that his second application\n\nshould not be pretermitted.\n\n             The    government    argued    that   Da   Cunha's   first    labor\n\ncertification did not give him grandfathered status because that\n\nlabor certification was not \"approvable when filed\" as required by\n\n8 C.F.R. § 245.10(a)(1)(i)(B).        In support of this contention, the\n\ngovernment produced a July, 2001 letter from the Vermont Department\n\nof Labor to Da Cunha, indicating that Bestfoods was an \"inactive\"\n\nemployer.     The government also noted that Da Cunha's pay stubs\n\nlisted his employer as Charles Freihofer Baking, rather than\n\nBestfoods,    and    that   the   labor    certification   was    signed   by   a\n\nBestfoods supervisor, not by a more senior company official.\n\n             Da Cunha did not introduce evidence before the IJ to\n\nrefute the government's contention.\n\n             In March, 2005, the IJ concluded that Da Cunha’s first\n\nlabor certification was not approvable when filed because it\n\nreferenced an employer who was \"inactive\" at the time of filing.\n\nNoting that Da Cunha did not refute his employer's inactive status,\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthe IJ pretermitted his I-485 adjustment of status application and\n\ndenied Da Cunha voluntary departure as a matter of discretion.\n\n              Da Cunha appealed the decision to the BIA and also filed\n\na motion to reopen, requesting that the BIA remand his case to the\n\nIJ so the IJ could consider new evidence about whether he should be\n\n\"grandfathered\" under section 245(i). The BIA adopted and affirmed\n\nthe decision of the IJ.      The BIA also denied Da Cunha’s motion to\n\nreopen, finding that the documents he sought to admit were not new\n\nor previously unavailable.      This petition followed.\n\n                                      II.\n\n              Da Cunha argues that his first labor certification was\n\n\"approvable when filed\" and that the BIA’s denial of his motion to\n\nreopen was an abuse of discretion.3\n\n              As to his first argument, we review the IJ’s decision\n\nunder the substantial evidence standard.

If it was not approvable when filed, then he is\n\nnot grandfathered and not eligible for an adjustment of status\n\nthrough   his    employment        with   Silva's    Donuts       because    his    2002\n\npriority date is too late under the regulations.                           8 C.F.R. §\n\n245.10(a)(1)(i)(B).\n\n            \"Approvable when filed\"               means     that,    at    the time of\n\nfiling, the qualifying application for labor certification was\n\n\"properly     filed,     meritorious        in    fact,    and    non-frivolous.\"\n\nEchevarria v.

The burden is on the petitioner to show that his\n\napplication was approvable when filed. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(2).\n\n            We focus on the second prong, whether the application was\n\nmeritorious in fact.        We said in Echevarria that there need not be\n\na finding of fraud to support a conclusion that an application is\n\nnot meritorious in fact.           505 F.3d at 19 n. 3.          There, a finding of\n\n\"identified      gaps\"    in   a    petitioner's          application,      where   the\n\npetitioner had been an opportunity to explain the gaps but failed\n\nto do so, was sufficient to show that the application was not\n\nmeritorious in fact.        Id.\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f          Here, like in Echevarria, the IJ identified a specific\n\ndiscrepancy in the labor certification application:      Bestfoods'\n\n\"inactive\" status.   The Vermont Department of Labor indicated that\n\nBestfoods was an \"inactive\" employer, in that it was not paying\n\nunemployment taxes for its workers, at the time that Da Cunha’s\n\nfirst labor certification was filed.   The burden was on Da Cunha to\n\nprove that his first labor certification was properly filed, yet he\n\noffered no evidence before the IJ or the BIA to refute the inactive\n\nstatus of his employer.   In fact, Da Cunha was explicitly invited\n\nto send contrary evidence or an explanation as to why Bestfoods was\n\ninactive to the Vermont Department of Labor, but did not do so.\n\n          Because Da Cunha failed to offer an explanation for the\n\ndiscrepancy that satisfied the IJ, the IJ concluded that Da Cunha’s\n\nfirst labor certification was not \"approvable when filed\" because\n\nit was not meritorious in fact.    This conclusion is supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence.\n\n          We note that Da Cunha finds no refuge in the provision in\n\n8 C.F.R. § 1245.10(a)(3) that preserves an alien's grandfathered\n\nstatus if a \"petition that was properly filed on or before April\n\n30, 2001, and was approvable when filed, but was later withdrawn,\n\ndenied, or revoked due to circumstances that have arisen after the\n\ntime of filing [and] . . . the alien is otherwise eligible.\"\n\nBecause we conclude that his first labor certification was not\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fapprovable when filed, it does not matter if it was later revoked\n\ndue to circumstances that arose after April 30, 2001.\n\n                                   III.\n\n            We review the BIA’s denial of a motion to reopen or\n\nreconsider only for abuse of discretion.
