George Z. Singal,         U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                         Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n         Souter, Associate Justice,* and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Thomas S. Marjerison, with whom Norman, Hanson & Detroy, LLC\nwas on brief, for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                                 May 21, 2010\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f               SOUTER, Associate Justice.        The defendant, Rannik Dent,\n\nwas   indicted     along   with   one   Jean    Fournier    for   conspiracy   to\n\npossess, and possession of, over fifty grams of cocaine base\n\nmeaning to distribute it.            The evidence against him included a\n\ntennis-ball sized lump of crack found in a backpack he had left\n\nunattended at the house of Jaime and Thomas Bolduc in Lewiston,\n\nMaine.        Dent’s motion to suppress the evidence as obtained in\n\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment was denied on the ground that\n\nunder the circumstances he had no reasonable expectation of privacy\n\nin the backpack.        We affirm.\n\n               Dent alternated living in New York City and Lewiston,\n\nwhere    he    stayed   with   the   Bolducs’    daughter    Erica.    He   also\n\ndeveloped a romantic interest in another adult daughter, Meagan,\n\nwho lived (at least periodically) down the street from Erica with\n\nher parents, two younger Bolduc children and Erica’s young son.\n\nDent frequented the Bolduc house and often looked after the younger\n\nchildren, whose photos in his possession showed his fondness for\n\nthem.    Occasionally, he would spend the night there with Meagan,\n\nthough Jaime ordered him not to do so, just as she instructed him\n\nnot to use the address to receive mail.               Dent had not received\n\npermission to leave belongings at the house, and Jaime testified\n\nthat she would have refused if he had asked for it.                Still, there\n\nwas a degree of cordiality between Dent and the elder Bolducs, who\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fonce paid his plane fare to New York, for which he reciprocated by\n\ngiving Jaime a watch.\n\n          On the day in question, the police received a tip that\n\nDent was distributing crack from Erica’s residence.   Then Fournier\n\nwas arrested shortly after leaving the house and promptly informed\n\non Dent, to the effect that Dent had hired him to deliver crack and\n\nremained in possession of more, which he kept in a plastic grocery\n\nbag that Fournier had seen him take to the Bolduc house.       The\n\npolice prepared to get a warrant to search for Dent’s effects but\n\nthen decided there was no time for that, since Fournier’s failure\n\nto return from the delivery errand might alert Dent that something\n\nhad gone wrong and lead him to jettison or hide any contraband.\n\nTwo police teams set out to find him, one going to Erica’s house\n\nand one to the Bolducs’ place.    After Dent was arrested at the\n\nformer location, the police sought permission to search the latter.\n\nOnce the Bolducs learned what the police were specifically after,\n\nJamie Bolduc led them to Meagan’s room.    She handed them Dent’s\n\nbackpack and told them to look inside, where they found the\n\nshopping bag with a lump of crack.      After the discovery, the\n\nBolducs and Meagan signed written consent-to-search forms.\n\n          Dent argues that it was error for the district court to\n\nconclude that he could not reasonably expect to maintain privacy in\n\na backpack left in the house while he was minding the younger\n\nchildren down the street.   See United States v. Rheault, 561 F.3d\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f55, 58-59 (1st Cir. 2009) (expectation of privacy is a threshold\n\ninquiry to establishing a Fourth Amendment violation).                       We agree\n\nthat if he had been in the house caring for the children with the\n\nBolducs’ obvious permission, it would indeed have been reasonable\n\nto expect them to respect his interest in keeping his personal\n\neffects to himself and to limit the police conduct accordingly;\n\ncommon notions of personal decency would have demanded no less.\n\nBut he was not there when the police were allowed in (and it is not\n\neven clear that Jaime knew that he was looking after the children\n\nat Erica’s house down the street).\n\n                  Dent had instead left his pack behind in a house in which\n\nhe had no property interest and no clearly defined social place.\n\nAlthough he had been helpful to the owners of the house and their\n\nfamily       and    had    exchanged   kindnesses     with      them,   he   had    been\n\nforbidden to stay there overnight even at the invitation of the\n\nowners’ daughter, had been told not to use the place even as a mail\n\ndrop,       and    had    no   permission   to    leave   his   belongings     there.1\n\nWithout more, any expectation of support in maintaining privacy in\n\nhis personal effects there would be described better as precarious\n\nthan reasonable, see United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 535\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).               There is more, however, yet a further fact\n\nmilitating against Dent’s claim of reasonable expectation.                         Jaime\n\n\n\n        1\n       Dent argues that the district court’s finding as to the lack\nof permission was clearly erroneous. This is not a serious claim.\n\n                                            -4-\n\fBolduc operated a large childcare center not far from the house, as\n\nanyone enjoying Dent’s association with the family would reasonably\n\nhave known and as Dent probably (to the degree of practical\n\ncertainty) knew in fact.     Any circumstance raising a suspicion of\n\nher complicity in criminal activity, or tolerance of it, could\n\ntherefore have seriously damaged her.      To have expected her to be\n\nanything but cooperative with the police would accordingly have\n\nbeen unrealistic, and to have expected her to subordinate her\n\ninterests in order to deter the police from examining property Dent\n\nleft behind at her house unattended would have been imprudent in\n\nthe   extreme.   On   the   facts   undisputed   here,   the   reasonable\n\nexpectation would have been that Jaime Bolduc would do what seemed\n\nbest for herself and would accommodate the police, to show that she\n\nhad no part in any questionable conduct by Dent and no sympathy for\n\nit.\n\n           There was no error in the district court’s conclusion\n\nthat Dent had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the backpack\n\nhe had left behind, and the motion to suppress the evidence\n\ndiscovered in it was properly denied.       Alternative arguments for\n\nadmissibility of the crack need not be considered.\n\n           The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f",
