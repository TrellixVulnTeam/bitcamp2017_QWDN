Gustavo A. Gelpí, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     José M. Casanova Edelmann on brief for appellant.\n     Lori J. Dym, Chief Counsel, Appellate Division, United States\nPostal Service, and Ray E. Donahue, Lead Counsel, on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n                        November 10, 2008\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.       On February 10, 2006, plaintiff-\n\nappellant Maria Velázquez Linares slipped and fell while a patron\n\nat the post office in Cataño, Puerto Rico.           Neither the details\n\nsurrounding her fall nor the extent of her injuries and damages are\n\ngermane to this appeal. Instead, we fast-forward to March 3, 2008,\n\nwhen the plaintiff sued the United States and others under the\n\nFederal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2671-2680.\n\n           The plaintiff duly filed her paper complaint in the\n\ndistrict court.   The Clerk issued a notice on March 13 stating that\n\nthe case was subject to the electronic case management system.\n\nThat is relevant because the court had in place a standing order —\n\nStanding Order No. 1 — providing in pertinent part that, in such\n\ncases, \"parties shall promptly provide the Clerk with electronic\n\ncopies of all documents previously provided in paper form.\"             The\n\nplaintiff did not furnish an electronic copy of her complaint.           On\n\nMarch 24 — three weeks after the commencement of the suit — the\n\ndistrict court, acting sua sponte, dismissed the action without\n\nprejudice.   The court at the same time fined plaintiff's counsel\n\n$150 as a sanction.\n\n           The plaintiff filed the complaint electronically five\n\ndays later and moved for reconsideration.           In that motion, her\n\ncounsel explained that electronic filing had not been accomplished\n\nearlier because of a malfunctioning computer in his law office.\n\nCounsel   attached   a   statement   from   a   computer   technician   who\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fverified the malfunction and related that he had been hired to\n\nrepair the defect on March 22.\n\n           The district court denied the motion for reconsideration\n\nwithout comment on April 2.          The next day, the plaintiff docketed\n\na notice of appeal.      The district court responded by issuing a nunc\n\npro tunc electronic order noting that \"even if counsel's computer\n\nmalfunctioned, he waited too long to cure his noncompliance with\n\nStanding Order No. 1.\"\n\n           We need not tarry.         When a trial court is faced with a\n\nviolation of a court order, it may choose from a \"broad universe of\n\npossible sanctions.\"       Tower Ventures, Inc. v. City of Westfield,\n\n296 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir. 2002).         Each case is sui generis.     Thus,\n\nin making the choice of a condign sanction, the court must give\n\nindividualized consideration to the particular circumstances of the\n\ncase.   Id.   We review the court's order for abuse of discretion.\n\nId.\n\n           Dismissal is among the most severe of sanctions, and it\n\nshould not be imposed without good reason.              See Young v. Gordon,\n\n330 F.3d 76, 81 (1st Cir. 2003) (explaining that \"dismissal should\n\nnot be viewed either as a sanction of first resort or as an\n\nautomatic penalty for every failure to abide by a court order\").\n\nThe   district   court   in   this    case   believed   that   dismissal   was\n\nappropriate because the plaintiff had transgressed Standing Order\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fNo. 1.      Under the totality of the circumstances, we find that\n\nconclusion problematic.\n\n            Standing Order No. 1 does not provide a set time within\n\nwhich a party must furnish an electronic copy of a pleading\n\npreviously filed in paper form.          The order merely recites that the\n\nelectronic copy shall be supplied \"promptly.\"                   That term has a\n\nprotean quality; what is \"prompt\" in one person's mind may not be\n\n\"prompt\"    in     another's,   and    what    is   \"prompt\"    in    one   set   of\n\ncircumstances may be laggardly in a different set of circumstances.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, we think it ordinarily would require the\n\npassage of more time than elapsed here to warrant sua sponte\n\ndismissal, without prior notice, on such a ground.                See Velázquez-\n\nRivera v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc., 920 F.2d 1072, 1076 (1st Cir.\n\n1990); cf. Rosario-Díaz v. González, 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (noting that \"litigants have an unflagging duty to comply\n\nwith   clearly      communicated      case-management     orders\")      (emphasis\n\nsupplied).\n\n            The district court, of course, had two easily available\n\nalternatives.       First, the court as an institution could have used\n\na fixed time parameter in place of \"promptly.\"                 Second, the court\n\nin   this   case    could   have   called     the   plaintiff's      attention    to\n\nStanding Order No. 1, demanded compliance within a specified time\n\nframe, and then taken action if that demand had gone unrequited.\n\nSee, e.g., Chamorro v. Puerto Rican Cars, Inc., 304 F.3d 1, 4-5\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f(1st Cir. 2002) (approving use of show-cause order in analogous\n\ncircumstance).          Here, however, the record on appeal contains no\n\nindication that the court afforded any forewarning of this sort to\n\nthe plaintiff.1\n\n                 Were there aggravating circumstances, the situation might\n\nbe more fluid.         See, e.g., Cósme Nieves v. Deshler, 826 F.2d 1, 2\n\n(1st Cir. 1987).         But in this case, the record reflects none.           For\n\naught that appears, plaintiff's counsel is a first-time offender;\n\nthere       is   not   the   slightest   whiff   of   bad   faith,    contumacious\n\nconduct, or habitual procrastination on his part.                     Moreover, he\n\npresented a plausible justification for the failure to furnish an\n\nelectronic copy of the complaint more celeritously — and the\n\ndistrict court did not question the truth of this explanation.\n\n                 Finally, the defendants have not made any showing of\n\nprejudice.          Indeed, their main argument seems to be that the\n\ndismissal order should not be treated seriously because it operated\n\nwithout prejudice.             See Appellees' Br. at 7.              That argument\n\noverlooks the inevitable costs associated with reinstituting an\n\n\n        1\n      The district court has published a Manual for Civil and\nCriminal Cases, Administrative Procedure for Filing, Signing and\nVerifying Pleadings and Papers by Electronic Means in the United\nStates District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, Rev. July\n26, 2006 (the Manual). With respect to electronic filing, section\nII.A.2 of the Manual states that if a complaint is filed in paper\nform only, the Clerk shall notify the filer that she has twenty-\nfour hours to file the complaint electronically. If no electronic\ncopy is then filed, the Clerk shall issue a second notice. Id.\nThere is no indication on the docket that any such notices were\ntransmitted in this case.\n\n                                         -5-\n\faction as well as the court's imposition of a monetary sanction to\n\naccompany the dismissal.\n\n           We need go no further.         In the peculiar circumstances of\n\nthis case, we hold that the district court read the standing order\n\ntoo inflexibly and acted outside the realm of its discretion in\n\ndismissing the action and imposing a monetary sanction without\n\nfirst affording the plaintiff notice and a brief opportunity to\n\ncure.   See Vinci v. Consol. Rail Corp., 927 F.2d 287, 288 (6th Cir.\n\n2001)   (stating   that   although    a    standing   order   may   have   put\n\nplaintiff on notice that dismissal could be imposed for failure to\n\nfollow a court order, the \"mechanical\" dismissal of an action\n\nbecause the attorney missed a required filing date was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion absent notice of the deficiency).              Accordingly, we\n\nvacate the order appealed from and remand for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n           The order for dismissal and for sanctions is reversed.\n\nThe case is reinstated.     All parties shall bear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f",

Rail Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556690\"><a href=\"/opinion/556690/angelo-j-vinci-v-consolidated-rail-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span>, 288 (6th Cir.2001) (stating that although a standing order may have put plaintiff on notice that dismissal could be imposed for failure to follow a court order, the \"mechanical\" dismissal of an action because the attorney missed a required filing date was an abuse of discretion absent notice of the deficiency). Accordingly, we vacate the order appealed from and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>The order for dismissal and for sanctions is reversed. The case is reinstated. All parties shall bear their own costs.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The district court has published a Manual for Civil and Criminal Cases, Administrative Procedure for Filing, Signing and Verifying Pleadings and Papers by Electronic Means in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, Rev. July 26, 2006 (the Manual). With respect to electronic filing, section II.A.2 of the Manual states that if a complaint is filed in paper form only, the Clerk shall notify the filer that she has twenty-four hours to file the complaint electronically. If no electronic copy is then filed, the Clerk shall issue a second notice. <i>Id.</i> There is no indication on the docket that any such notices were transmitted in this case.</p>\n\n</div>",
