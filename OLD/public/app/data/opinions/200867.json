No. 105-17,\n\n111 Stat. 37 (1997), reinforced the principle that children should\n\nnot be removed unnecessarily from regular education environments,\n\n20 U.S.C. ยง 1412(a)(5)(A), in part by eliminating \"inappropriate\n\nfinancial incentives for referring children to special education.\"\n\nH.R. Rep. 105-95, at 90 (1997), reprinted in 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. 78,\n\n87.       One    specific    purpose   of   the   amendments   was   to   control\n\ngovernment expenditures for students voluntarily placed in private\n\nschools by their parents.          See id. at 91-92.\n\n                At issue in this case is whether the parents of Katie C.1\n\nare entitled to reimbursement from the Greenland, New Hampshire\n\nSchool District for Katie's tuition at a private special-needs\n\nschool, the Learning Skills Academy, for part of the fifth grade\n\nand all of the sixth grade.                 Katie's parents sought tuition\n\nreimbursement        after    having    unilaterally    removed      Katie   from\n\nGreenland Central School at the end of fourth grade and placed her\n\nin private school, without ever before raising with Greenland\n\nschool officials the issue of special education services for Katie.\n\nThe district court, reversing the due process hearing officer, held\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The captioned plaintiffs in this case, Amy N. and Robert N.,\nare Katie C.'s parents.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fthat Katie and her parents were not entitled to such reimbursement.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            Katie, born in March 1990, started first grade at the\n\nGreenland Central School, a public school, in 1996. Although Katie\n\nwas a good student, her first grade teacher noticed that she had\n\ndifficulty    focusing   on    classroom      activities     and    was    easily\n\ndistracted.    During the summer after first grade, Katie's parents,\n\nMr. and Mrs. N., took Katie to a private psychologist who diagnosed\n\nher with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).                    The\n\npsychiatrist    suggested     several       practical    steps     that   Katie's\n\nteachers could take to counteract her ADHD, including providing her\n\nwith a checklist of tasks to complete and seating her in the front\n\nof the classroom.\n\n             Katie's second, third, and fourth grade teachers each\n\nused   techniques    similar     to     those       recommended     by    Katie's\n\npsychiatrist to help Katie stay on task.                They sat Katie in the\n\nfront of the classroom, provided her with a checklist of items she\n\nwas to complete, and maintained frequent contact with Mrs. N. about\n\nKatie's performance.        Some of her teachers also employed basic\n\nbehavior     modification     techniques       to    help    improve      Katie's\n\nconcentration,    such   as    providing       incentives    for     Katie   with\n\nstickers.      Katie's teachers frequently used these and similar\n\nmethods to help other students focus too.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f           Mrs. N., who is herself a special education teacher at a\n\nnearby high school, also spent a considerable amount of time\n\nhelping her daughter with her schoolwork.          She spent 2-3 hours a\n\nnight helping Katie with her homework in second grade and provided\n\n3-4 hours of assistance each night in the third grade.        By the time\n\nKatie was in fourth grade, her parents had hired a tutor to meet\n\nwith her twice a week.\n\n           Katie's academic performance during her four years at\n\nGreenland ranged from average to above-average.         In second grade,\n\nKatie was grouped with students who had good reading skills,\n\nalthough she had some difficulties with math.          Her second grade\n\nteacher viewed Katie as a \"competent learner\" and Katie received a\n\npassing grade in all of her subjects.2      Katie continued to perform\n\nreasonably well in third and fourth grades, earning mostly A's and\n\nB's on her report card.     Katie's third grade teacher viewed her as\n\n\"very bright\" and a \"good learner\" and her fourth grade teacher\n\nsaid her academic performance was \"between an eight and a nine\" on\n\na ten-point scale.\n\n           Katie's academic marks were consistent with her scores on\n\nthe California Achievement Test, a national standardized test that\n\nKatie    took   in   the   second   and   fourth    grades.     On   both\n\nadministrations of the test, Katie scored in the average to above-\n\n\n\n     2\n      Second grade students at Greenland do not receive a letter or\nnumber grade, but instead simply \"pass\" or \"fail.\"\n\n                                    -4-\n\faverage range on all of the tested subjects.            She also received an\n\naverage score on all subparts of the New Hampshire End of Grade 3\n\nAssessment, another standardized test.\n\n           Throughout her time at Greenland, though, Katie still\n\noccasionally       had   difficulty    maintaining    her    concentration   on\n\ndiscrete tasks.          She also had problems making friends and was\n\nsometimes teased by her classmates.            In Katie's fourth grade year,\n\nMrs. N. became sufficiently concerned about peer harassment that\n\nshe contacted Katie's teacher.\n\n           At no point during Katie's time at Greenland did her\n\nparents or any of her teachers request that she be evaluated for\n\nspecial education services.            Katie's second grade teacher noted\n\nthat Katie did not meet the general profile of a special education\n\nstudent because there was not a gap between her apparent learning\n\nability and her academic performance.            Similarly, her third grade\n\nteacher said that Katie's difficulties with paying attention were\n\nconcerns for her physician and that she did not believe that Katie\n\nrequired special education services.\n\n           In August of 2000, the summer that Katie completed fourth\n\ngrade, Katie's parents unilaterally removed her from the Greenland\n\nCentral School and enrolled her in Mont Blanc Academy.              Mont Blanc\n\nAcademy   is   a    private   school    that   does   not   focus   on   special\n\neducation students and, when Katie's parents enrolled her there,\n\nthey \"weren't looking for special education.\"               When Katie started\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\ffifth grade at Mont Blanc, the school instructed Mrs. N. not to\n\nhelp Katie with her homework.         As a result, Katie struggled with\n\nsome of her classes and failed her first quarter math class,\n\nalthough she passed her other classes.         In November, after Mrs. N.\n\nlearned of Katie's failing math grade, she resumed helping Katie\n\nwith her homework and Katie's math grade rose to a B.\n\n              For reasons unspecified in the record, Mont Blanc Academy\n\nrequested in February of 2001 that Katie's parents withdraw her\n\nfrom the school.          One month later, in March of 2001, Katie's\n\nparents enrolled her at the Learning Skills Academy (LSA) for the\n\nremainder of her fifth grade year.          LSA is a private school that\n\nhas only about thirty enrolled students, most of whom either suffer\n\nfrom a learning disability or ADHD.           Tuition for Katie's spring\n\nterm at LSA was $16,000.\n\n              At approximately the same time that Katie started at LSA,\n\nMrs.     N.   contacted    Melanie   Lovering,   the     special    education\n\ncoordinator for Greenland Central School, and requested that Katie\n\nbe evaluated by the psychologist on call with the school, Dr.\n\nSecor.    This was the first time that Katie's parents had notified\n\nGreenland that Katie might need special education services.              Mrs.\n\nN., being a special education teacher and administrator herself,\n\nwas    familiar   with    the   processes   associated    with     identifying\n\nchildren who require special education.            Katie's parents told\n\nGreenland that their major concerns with Katie's development were\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\ffocused on \"written language, organization and hyperactivity.\" The\n\nschool responded by scheduling a \"disposition of referral meeting\"3\n\nto take place about two weeks later, on April 6, 2001.\n\n                 At the April 6 meeting, three Greenland special education\n\nteachers, two representatives from LSA, an occupational therapist,\n\nDr. Secor, Ms. Lovering, and Mrs. N. all met to discuss Katie's\n\neligibility for special education services at Greenland. The group\n\nagreed that they did not at that point have sufficient information\n\nto determine whether Katie should be coded as learning disabled.\n\nAccordingly, they planned a battery of tests and evaluations that\n\nGreenland school officials would conduct over the next several\n\nweeks       to    gather    more   information    on    Katie's    strengths    and\n\nweaknesses. These included multiple standardized tests in math and\n\nwritten expression and, at Mrs. N.'s request, various psychological\n\nassessments by Dr. Secor.\n\n                 On May 23, 2001, the school district held a meeting with\n\nMrs. N. to assess the results of Katie's tests and evaluations and\n\ndetermine whether Katie was eligible for special education services\n\nat Greenland.         The school officials in attendance, including Dr.\n\nSecor, Ms. Lovering, and four others, unanimously determined that\n\neven       though   Katie    had   ADHD   and    an    anxiety    disorder,    those\n\nconditions did not adversely affect her educational performance.\n\n\n       3\n      A \"disposition of referral meeting\" is a procedure used by\nGreenland following a request to determine whether a particular\nchild is eligible for special education services.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fThey also unanimously concluded that Katie did not have a learning\n\ndisability because there was no evidence of a discrepancy between\n\nKatie's ability and her achievement.            The officials nonetheless\n\nagreed to offer Katie a plan to address some of her organizational\n\nweaknesses.\n\n              In a letter dated May 29, 2001, Katie's parents informed\n\nMichelle Langa, the assistant superintendent of the Greenland\n\nSchool District, that they disagreed with the district's decision\n\nfinding Katie ineligible for special education services.                  The\n\nletter informed the district that Mr. and Mrs. N. had scheduled an\n\nappointment with an independent psychiatrist named Dr. Spitzer, but\n\nit did not request any specific further action on the part of\n\nGreenland.     Again, at the time Katie's parents sent this letter in\n\nMay   2001,    Katie   was   already   in    private   school,   having   been\n\nwithdrawn from public school in August 2000.\n\n              Dr. Spitzer evaluated Katie in May and sent a letter to\n\nMichelle Langa on August 15, 2001 detailing her conclusions.               Dr.\n\nSpitzer confirmed Katie's diagnosis of ADHD, but she also concluded\n\nthat Katie suffers from Asperger's disorder.            Asperger's disorder\n\nis a developmental disability on the autism spectrum that is\n\nassociated with significant misperceptions of otherwise routine\n\nelements of daily life.        It is a permanent condition that is not\n\ntreatable with medication.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f           Meanwhile, Katie's parents decided to re-enroll Katie in\n\nLSA for sixth grade, the 2001-2002 school year.                     Katie had done\n\nwell at LSA during the spring semester of her fifth grade year,\n\nmaking    significant      strides      in    her    academic       and    emotional\n\ndevelopment.   She no longer relied on her mother to assist her with\n\nher homework, developed positive peer relationships, and was a\n\n\"much more confident, happier child.\"\n\n           On September 12, 2001, as Katie was starting sixth grade\n\nat LSA, Greenland school officials met with Dr. Spitzer to review\n\nher   conclusion   that    Katie     suffered       from   Asperger's      disorder.\n\nAlthough Dr. Secor, who also attended the meeting, disputed this\n\ndiagnosis, the team decided to reverse its earlier determination\n\nthat Katie did not qualify for special education services.                    Rather\n\nthan code Katie as \"autistic,\" consistent with the diagnosis of\n\nAsperger's disorder, the team agreed to code her as \"other health\n\nimpaired.\"\n\n           Over    the    next   several      months,      school   officials       met\n\nseveral   times    with   Mrs.     N.   and   her     advocate      to    develop   an\n\nIndividual Education Plan (IEP) that would provide Katie with\n\nappropriate special educational services at Greenland.                    Throughout\n\nthis process, Katie remained a student at LSA.                   By mid-November,\n\nthe team of school officials, in conjunction with Mrs. N. and her\n\nadvocate, had developed a working draft of Katie's initial IEP.\n\nThe draft provided for Katie to re-enroll in Greenland public\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fschool and have a personal aide who would assist her with \"social\n\npragmatic skills across a variety of settings and partners\" and\n\nhelp develop her \"graphing and discourse skills.\"\n\n           On November 15, 2001, as the final details of Katie's IEP\n\nwere being worked out, Katie's parents filed a due process hearing\n\nrequest.   The letter requesting the hearing indicated that Katie's\n\nparents appreciated the school's efforts in drafting an IEP for\n\nKatie, and explained that they were seeking reimbursement for\n\nKatie's tuition at LSA and were concerned that the time for filing\n\na hearing request would soon expire.             Although surprised and\n\nconfused by the due process hearing request, school officials\n\ncompleted the final version of Katie's IEP several weeks later. In\n\naddition to providing Katie with services at Greenland, including\n\nher own aide, the plan set forth a curriculum to help Katie learn\n\nthe difference between friendly joking and hurtful teasing, a\n\nproblem with which children suffering from Asperger's disorder have\n\nparticular difficulty.     It also included counseling services for\n\nKatie   and    speech/language     services    that   Dr.       Spitzer    had\n\nrecommended.     Even   after    Greenland    completed   the    IEP,     Katie\n\nremained enrolled at LSA instead of returning to Greenland and\n\nreceiving the services outlined in the IEP.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f                                  II.\n\nA.   Administrative Proceedings\n\n           In response to Mr. and Mrs. N.'s due process hearing\n\nrequest, the hearing officer held a prehearing conference on\n\nJanuary 15, 2002.    At that conference, the parents said that, in\n\naddition to seeking reimbursement, they were challenging the school\n\ndistrict's failure to identify Katie as eligible for special\n\neducation services in May of 2001 (when she was a student at LSA).\n\nThe parents also indicated that they were dissatisfied with the\n\nplan that Greenland had developed in the Fall of 2001 to educate\n\nKatie at Greenland because, despite its reliance on an aide to\n\nassist Katie, no such aide had been hired.\n\n           The   hearing   officer   heard   testimony   from   sixteen\n\nwitnesses over three days and issued a decision on February 20,\n\n2002.   The decision rejected Greenland's argument that it was not\n\nobliged to develop an IEP for Katie because she was unilaterally\n\nplaced in a private school by her parents; it concluded that\n\nGreenland had to offer Katie an IEP pursuant to its \"child find\"\n\nobligations. The decision also found that Greenland had erred when\n\nin May 2001 it failed to find Katie eligible for special education\n\nservices. Reasoning that Katie was in effect receiving specialized\n\neducation throughout her time at Greenland, the hearing officer\n\nconcluded that the team's reliance on the lack of an apparent gap\n\nbetween Katie's ability and her performance was legally deficient.\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f          The hearing officer also concluded that Katie would be\n\nill-served by returning to Greenland.   He found that Greenland did\n\nnot have any aide or staff with whom it could place Katie if she\n\nwere to return to the school and that, even if an aide existed,\n\nGreenland's proposed IEP would not provide Katie with a Free\n\nAppropriate Public Education (FAPE).    Based on these conclusions,\n\nthe hearing officer ordered Greenland to reimburse Mr. and Mrs. N.\n\nfor Katie's tuition at LSA for both the second semester of her\n\nfifth grade year and the entirety of her sixth grade year.     This\n\namounted to $48,000.\n\nB.   District Court Decision\n\n          Pursuant to 20 U.S.C. ยง 1415(i)(2), the school district\n\nchallenged in district court the hearing officer's decision.   The\n\ndistrict court reversed the bulk of the hearing officer's holdings,\n\nconcluding that the hearing officer had incorrectly considered the\n\nadequacy of the IEP offered by Greenland and the availability of\n\ntuition reimbursement.     The district court found that Katie was\n\nenrolled in private school (Mont Blanc Academy) before her parents\n\never raised the question of special education and that FAPE was not\n\n\"at issue\" when Katie was removed from Greenland.   On this basis,\n\nthe district court concluded that the hearing officer had only the\n\nstatutory authority to consider whether Greenland had violated its\n\n\"child find\" obligation.    34 C.F.R. ยง 300.451.\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f          The court affirmed the portion of the hearing officer's\n\nopinion that concluded the school district erred in failing to code\n\nKatie as a child with a disability in May 2001.                   Construing that\n\nportion of the opinion as stemming from the school district's\n\n\"child find\" obligation, the court determined that the hearing\n\nofficer had the authority to consider the issue.                  After reviewing\n\nthe hearing officer's decision on the merits, the court affirmed.\n\nBecause the district court denied reimbursement on other grounds,\n\nthis ruling did not affect the plaintiffs' claim for relief.\n\n          Katie's    parents    appeal      the    portion    of    the    district\n\ncourt's opinion reversing the hearing officer's determinations.\n\nGreenland School District cross-appeals, arguing that the district\n\ncourt incorrectly affirmed the hearing officer's determination that\n\nKatie should have been coded as a child with a disability in May\n\n2001.\n\n                                    III.\n\n          Our    review   is   de   novo,    as    this    case    only    presents\n\nquestions of law.    Manchester Sch. Dist. v. Crisman, 306 F.3d 1, 9\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          New    Hampshire     implements     IDEA     through       its    special\n\neducation law.    N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann ยง 186-C.            The state has adopted\n\nby reference the federal regulations as to special education for\n\ndisabled students in private schools.             N.H. Code Admin. Rules, Ed.\n\n1117.03 (2003).     Thus, Katie's rights under New Hampshire law are\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fthe same as her rights under federal law and no greater.        See Gary\n\nS. v. Manchester Sch. Dist., 241 F. Supp. 2d 111, 122-23 (D.N.H.\n\n2003).\n\n           This case turns on the 1997 IDEA Amendments.            Those\n\namendments affect this case in three ways.       First, the amendments\n\nmake clear that while local school systems have \"child find\"\n\nobligations as to students with disabilities in private schools,\n\nthey do not have to provide such students with the full complement\n\nof services that a student in public school with special needs\n\nwould receive.     See 20 U.S.C. ยง 1412(a)(10)(A);         34 C.F.R. ยง\n\n300.454(a)(1) (\"No private school child with a disability has an\n\nindividual right to receive some or all of the special education\n\nand related services that the child would receive if enrolled in a\n\npublic school.\"). Second, they establish that complaints about the\n\nservices a disabled student in private school is receiving after he\n\nor she has been identified must be brought through the state\n\nadministrative complaint system rather than a due process hearing.\n\n34 C.F.R. ยง 300.457 (a), (c).        Finally and most importantly, the\n\namendments limit the circumstances in which parents who have\n\nunilaterally placed their child in a private school are entitled to\n\nreimbursement for that placement.      See 20 U.S.C. ยง 1412(a)(10)(C).\n\nA.   Obligation to Provide Services to Disabled Private School\n     Children and the Proper Forum for Such Claims.\n\n          The    district   court    vacated   the   hearing   officer's\n\nevaluation of the IEP that Greenland offered to Katie because it\n\n                                    -14-\n\fconcluded that this issue was not properly before the hearing\n\nofficer.   That ruling was correct.\n\n           Because Katie was enrolled at LSA, a private school, when\n\nshe filed her due process hearing request, her rights under IDEA\n\nare governed by 20 U.S.C. ยง 1412(a)(10).       That subsection divides\n\nchildren in private school into two categories: (1) children\n\nenrolled in private schools by their parents, and (2) children\n\nplaced in or referred to private schools by public agencies.         See\n\nid. ยง 1412(a)(10) (A), (B).      It is undisputed that Katie falls in\n\nthe former category, as she was not placed in or referred to Mont\n\nBlanc or LSA by a public agency.\n\n           Participating school districts such as Greenland owe\n\nchildren who fall within subsection (A) of ยง 1412(a)(10) a \"child\n\nfind\" obligation.    See ยง 1412(a)(10)(A)(ii).         This obligation\n\nrequires those districts to \"locate, identify and evaluate all\n\nprivate school children with disabilities\" using methods that are\n\n\"comparable to activities undertaken for children with disabilities\n\nin public school.\"   34 C.F.R. ยง 300.451(b).        In the event that a\n\ndistrict fails to meet its \"child find\" obligations, a child's\n\nparents can initiate a due process hearing under the procedures\n\noutlined in ยงยง 300.504-300.515.      See id. ยง 300.457.\n\n           Importantly,   IDEA    also   provides   that   participating\n\ndistricts must provide certain services to disabled children in\n\nprivate school once those children have been identified through the\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fchild find process.   See id. ยงยง 300.452 - 300.462.   These services\n\nare, not surprisingly, less extensive than the services that a\n\ndisabled child enrolled in public school is entitled to receive.\n\nNot only are the services provided to students in these two\n\nsettings different in scope, but the procedure for review of claims\n\nof a denial of services is also different.      Parents of disabled\n\nchildren voluntarily enrolled in private school cannot initiate a\n\ndue process hearing if they feel their child is not receiving the\n\nservices required by IDEA.    See id. ยง 300.457(a).    Rather, such\n\nparents must proceed through an alternative procedure within the\n\nstate's administrative apparatus.     See id. ยง 300.457(c).   As the\n\ncomments to the draft of the regulations explain:\n\n     While there may be legitimate issues regarding the\n     provision of services to a particular parentally-placed\n     private school child with disabilities [that a local\n     education agency] has agreed to serve, due process should\n     not apply, as there is no individual right to these\n     services under the IDEA. Disputes that arise about these\n     services are properly subject to the State complaint\n     procedures.\n\n64 Fed. Reg. 12406, 12605 (March 12, 1999).\n\n          As the district court recognized, any complaints that\n\nKatie's parents had regarding Katie's IEP in the fall of 2001\n\nshould have been brought through the state complaint process.    The\n\nadequacy of the IEP was not an appropriate subject for the due\n\nprocess hearing because it had nothing to do with Greenland's child\n\nfind obligation.   Once Greenland identified Katie as a child with\n\na disability in September 2001, the district had performed every\n\n                               -16-\n\fact reviewable by a hearing officer; any subsequent obligations it\n\nhad to provide educational services to Katie were matters for the\n\nstate     administrative   procedure,    which    would   apply   different\n\nstandards to evaluate the services provided than did the due\n\nprocess hearing officer.      See 34 C.F.R. ยง 300.457(c) (question in\n\nstate administrative procedure is whether the district met its\n\nobligations under ยงยง 300.451-300.462).           That decision, moreover,\n\nwould not be appealable to federal court.         See Vultaggio v. Bd. of\n\nEduc., 343 F.3d 598, 601 (2d Cir. 2003).\n\nB.   Tuition Reimbursement for Students Unilaterally Placed in\n     Private Schools4\n\n            The substantive question in this case is whether Katie's\n\nparents were eligible for tuition reimbursement and, if so, whether\n\nit was an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny\n\nreimbursement for either Katie's fifth or sixth grade school year.5\n\nWe affirm the district court's determination on the ground that\n\nKatie's parents were ineligible for reimbursement.\n\n             Until 1985, there was some uncertainty about whether the\n\nremedy of reimbursement for private school tuition was available\n\n\n      4\n      Katie's parents do not make a claim for compensatory services\nfor past inadequacies. Cf. Maine Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 35 v. Mr.\nR., 321 F.3d 9, 17-18 (1st Cir. 2003) (discussing such claims).\n      5\n      This issue was properly before the hearing officer on Katie's\nparents' due process request.        See 34 C.F.R. ยง 300.403(b)\n(\"Disagreements between a parent and a public agency regarding the\navailability of a program appropriate for the child, and the\nquestion of financial responsibility, are subject to the due\nprocess procedures of ยงยง 300.500-300.517.\").\n\n                                  -17-\n\fwhen a school district had failed to provide appropriate services\n\nto a disabled child in the public school.                    IDEA itself only\n\nauthorized     the    district    court   to   \"grant    such   relief     as   [it]\n\ndetermine[d] is appropriate.\"             20 U.S.C. ยง 1415(e)(2) (1984),\n\nrecodified as amended 20 U.S.C. ยง 1415(i)(2)(B).                In Burlington v.\n\nDep't of Educ., 471 U.S. 359 (1985), the Supreme Court held that\n\nthis    clause       authorized    the    equitable      remedy       of   tuition\n\nreimbursement.        See id. at 369.     It noted that the broad language\n\nof the statute vested courts with significant discretion to craft\n\nappropriate remedies and that, in cases where it would take a\n\nsignificant amount of time for the school to offer appropriate\n\nservices, the Act's promise of a free appropriate public education\n\ncould justify the remedy of reimbursement for private school\n\ntuition.       Id.    at   370.    The    Court   also    found    that    tuition\n\nreimbursement was available even in some instances when parents had\n\nunilaterally removed their child from public school.                  Id. at 372.\n\n              Uncertainty about the circumstances under which tuition\n\nreimbursement was available remained even after Burlington. Before\n\nthe    1997    IDEA    amendments,    several     circuits      had    held     that\n\nreimbursement for private school tuition depended on the parents\n\ncooperating with school authorities in determining the proper\n\nplacement and educational plan for the child.               See Patricia P. v.\n\nBd. of Educ., 203 F.3d 462, 468 (7th Cir. 2000) (listing cases\n\ninterpreting pre-amendment IDEA).              As one court noted, \"parents\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fwho, because of their failure to cooperate, do not allow a school\n\ndistrict a reasonable opportunity to evaluate their disabled child,\n\nforfeit their claim for reimbursement for a unilateral private\n\nplacement.\" Id. at 469. Although few courts precisely defined the\n\nlevel of cooperation necessary, most thought it clear that, at a\n\nminimum, the parents had to inform the school district of their\n\nconcerns about their child's special needs and about the plan\n\nproposed before removing the child from public school.         See Berger\n\nv. Medina City Sch. Dist., 348 F.3d 513, 523 (6th Cir. 2003) (\"Even\n\nbefore the IDEA was amended to explicitly require such notice, this\n\ncourt held that dissatisfied parents were required to complain to\n\nthe public school to afford the school a chance to remedy the IEP\n\nbefore removing their disabled child from the school.\"); M.C. ex\n\nrel. Mrs. C. v. Voluntown Bd. of Educ., 226 F.3d 60, 68 (2d Cir.\n\n2000) (\"[C]ourts have held uniformly that reimbursement is barred\n\nwhere parents unilaterally arrange for private educational services\n\nwithout ever notifying the school board of their dissatisfaction\n\nwith their child's IEP.\"); Ash v. Lake Oswego Sch. Dist., No. 7J,\n\n980 F.2d 585, 589 (9th Cir. 1992); Evans v. District No. 17, 841\n\nF.2d 824, 829 (8th Cir. 1988).\n\n           The 1997 Amendments endorsed this line of cases and\n\nhelped clarify the amount of parental cooperation required by\n\nadding a   section   to   IDEA   entitled   \"Payment   for   education   of\n\nchildren enrolled in private schools without consent of or referral\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fby the public agency.\"       20 U.S.C. ยง 1412(a)(10)(C); see H.R. Rep.\n\n105-95,   at   93,   reprinted   in    1997    U.S.C.C.A.N.         78,    90.    See\n\ngenerally Gary S., 241 F. Supp. 2d at 114-15.                That section begins\n\nwith a general statement of policy explaining that IDEA does not\n\n\"require a local education agency to pay for the cost of education,\n\nincluding special education and related services, of a child with\n\na disability at a private school or facility if that agency made a\n\nfree appropriate public education available to the child and the\n\nparents elected to place the child in such private school or\n\nfacility.\"     20 U.S.C. ยง 1412(a)(10)(C)(i).           This provision, taken\n\nby itself, might be considered ambiguous as applied to a situation\n\nwhere, as here, the local education agency was never informed while\n\nthe child was in public school that the child might require special\n\neducation services.       But this seeming ambiguity disappears when\n\nconsidered in light of the section's affirmative requirement that\n\n\"the parents of a child with a disability, who previously received\n\nspecial education and related services under the authority of a\n\npublic agency\" can receive reimbursement for their unilateral\n\nplacement of the child in private school only \"if [a] court or\n\nhearing   officer    finds   that     the    agency    had    not    made    a    free\n\nappropriate public education available to the child in a timely\n\nmanner prior to that enrollment.\"            Id. ยง 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).\n\n           These     threshold   requirements         are   key   to      this   case:\n\ntuition reimbursement is only available for children who have\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fpreviously received \"special education and related services\"6 while\n\nin the public school system (or perhaps7 those who at least timely\n\nrequested such services while the child is in public school).\n\nThere is no dispute that neither Katie's parents nor anyone else\n\nrequested an evaluation for Katie while she was at Greenland.\n\nThere is also no dispute that she was removed from Greenland for\n\nreasons having nothing to do with any issue about whether Katie was\n\nreceiving FAPE.     Whether some of the techniques used for Katie in\n\nthe regular classroom (such as the use of checklists) may also be\n\ntechniques used in special education is beside the point.       The\n\npoint is that there was no notice at all to the school system\n\n\n\n\n     6\n         The full text of ยง 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) is:\n\n          If the parents of a child with a disability, who\n          previously received special education and related\n          services under the authority of a public agency,\n          enroll the child in a private elementary or\n          secondary school without the consent of or referral\n          by the public agency, a court or a hearing officer\n          may require the agency to reimburse the parents for\n          the cost of that enrollment if the court or hearing\n          officer finds that the agency had not made a free\n          appropriate public education available to the child\n          in a timely manner prior to that enrollment.\n\n     7\n      Despite the language of the statute, some legislative history\nsuggests that Congress meant to include children who had requested\nbut not yet received special needs services during their period in\nthe public schools. See H.R. Rep. 105-95, at 91-93, reprinted in\n1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. 78, 89-90.      That issue does not need to be\nresolved in this case, as Katie's parents never requested special\neducation services for Katie while she was at Greenland.\n\n                                 -21-\n\fbefore Katie's removal from Greenland that there was any issue\n\nabout whether Katie was in need of special education.\n\n             Even for children who received special education services\n\nin the public schools before the private school placement, the 1997\n\nAmendments     implemented    several    additional   limitations     on\n\nreimbursement.     Those limitations reinforce our conclusion that\n\nKatie and her parents are not eligible for tuition reimbursement.\n\nThe statute provides that reimbursement may8 be denied or reduced\n\nif the parents do not give the school district notice of their\n\nintent to remove their child from public school before they do so.\n\nId. ยง 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I); see Rafferty v. Cranston Pub. Sch.\n\nComm., 315 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir. 2002).           That notice can be\n\nprovided either \"at the most recent IEP meeting that the parents\n\nattended prior to removal of the child from the public school\" or\n\nby written notice ten business days prior to such removal.           20\n\nU.S.C.   ยง    1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I).     The   statute   also   creates\n\nexceptions to this notice requirement, such as when the parents are\n\nilliterate or the child will face physical or serious emotional\n\nharm by providing notice. Id. ยง 1412(a)(10)(C)(iv). None of those\n\nexceptions is presented here.\n\n\n\n     8\n      There may be extreme cases where it is obvious to a school\nthat a child is a special needs child but the school fails to\ninform parents, who are ignorant of their rights under IDEA.\nWhether this situation would warrant an exception to the general\nrule as an exercise of equitable jurisdiction is something we need\nnot address.\n\n                                  -22-\n\f          These statutory provisions make clear Congress's intent\n\nthat before parents place their child in private school, they must\n\nat least give notice to the school that special education is at\n\nissue.   This serves the important purpose of giving the school\n\nsystem an opportunity, before the child is removed, to assemble a\n\nteam, evaluate the child, devise an appropriate plan, and determine\n\nwhether a free appropriate public education can be provided in the\n\npublic schools.    See Patricia P., 203 F.3d at 468; Schoenfeld v.\n\nParkway Sch. Dist., 138 F.3d 379, 381-82 (8th Cir. 1998); cf.\n\nBurlington, 471 U.S. at 373 (discussing the importance of reviewing\n\na child's educational needs while the child is in the regular\n\npublic school classroom).\n\n          Reading IDEA as plaintiffs propose would destroy those\n\nsafeguards.   Here, the parents, well acquainted with IDEA, gave no\n\nnotice that Katie might need special education services.          Indeed,\n\nthey were not even looking for such services when they removed\n\nKatie from public school.   Several courts, relying on the parents'\n\nfailure to challenge the IEP's adequacy, have found insufficient\n\nnotice to the school district even when the parents requested an\n\nevaluation and received an IEP before removing their child.          See,\n\ne.g.,    Berger,   348   F.3d   at    523-24   (affirming   a   denial   of\n\nreimbursement when the child's parents agreed to the IEP proposed\n\nby the school and only informed the school district of their\n\nconcerns after they arranged for the child's enrollment in private\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fschool); see also M.C., 226 F.3d at 68 (denying reimbursement for\n\npsychological counseling that the court assumed necessary for the\n\nchild to benefit from special education because the parents had\n\nfailed to raise the issue in the child's IEP before the counseling\n\nstarted).    If the parents' conduct provided inadequate notice in\n\nthese cases, then there was clearly insufficient notice here, where\n\nthe parents never even raised the issue of special education before\n\nremoving Katie from Greenland.9\n\n            The regulations promulgated under IDEA, to which we must\n\ngive deference, Irving Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Tatro, 468 U.S. 883,\n\n892 & n.9 (1984), are consistent with our reading of the statute.\n\nFor the most part, the regulations provide little additional\n\nguidance in interpreting the statute because they merely repeat the\n\nstatute's language.    Compare, e.g., 20 U.S.C. ยง 1412(a)(10)(C),\n\nwith 34 C.F.R. ยง 300.403.   However, the regulations do provide one\n\ninterpretive clue by organizing the statutory provisions dealing\n\nwith reimbursement under the heading \"Children with Disabilities\n\n\n     9\n      Katie's parents rely on James ex. rel. James v. Upper\nArlington City School Dist., 228 F.3d 764 (6th Cir. 2000), for the\nproposition that they should not be required to re-enroll Katie in\nthe Greenland schools to reestablish her legal rights to an\nappropriate educational program. However, James concerned events\nbefore the 1997 Amendments and also involved the refusal by the\nschool system to do an IEP evaluation before enrollment of the\nchild in private school. Id. at 768. That issue is not involved\nhere.   In fact, in this case there were no disagreements, due\nprocess hearing requests, or administrative review proceedings\nongoing at the time Katie was removed from the public schools, so\nthe \"stay put\" provisions of IDEA, 20 U.S.C. ยง 1415(j), are not at\nissue, unlike in James.\n\n                                -24-\n\fenrolled by their parents in private school when FAPE is at issue.\"\n\nSee 34   C.F.R.    ยง   300.403    (emphasis     added).         This    formulation\n\nindicates   that   the       Department   of   Education        views    notice   as\n\ncritically important in the statutory scheme: it is difficult to\n\nimagine FAPE being \"at issue\" when neither the school nor the\n\nchild's parents have ever raised the question of FAPE.                    Even more\n\nthan the statute, the regulations suggest that a child like Katie\n\nwho is removed from her school without her parents or her school\n\never questioning       the    availability     of   FAPE   is    not    within    the\n\ncategory of children eligible for tuition reimbursement.\n\n            Katie's parents argue that even if they did not give\n\nsufficient notice to Greenland for Katie's fifth grade year, they\n\ndid provide sufficient notice that Katie would be attending LSA by\n\nthe time of her sixth grade year. Although Greenland was certainly\n\naware that Katie might be attending LSA for the fall semester of\n\nher sixth grade year, that fact is beside the point.                    The purpose\n\nof the notice requirement is to give public school districts the\n\nopportunity to provide FAPE before a child leaves public school and\n\nenrolls in private school.           See Patricia P., 203 F.3d at 468\n\n(emphasizing the importance of cooperation between parents and the\n\nschool district before the child is removed from public school);\n\nSchoenfeld, 138 F.3d at 381-82 (same); Town of Burlington v. Dep't\n\nof Educ., 736 F.2d 773, 799 (1st Cir. 1984) (noting the distinction\n\n\"between a unilateral parental transfer made after consultation\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fwith the school system . . . and transfers made truly unilaterally,\n\nbereft   of    any   attempt   to    achieve   negotiated   compromise    and\n\nagreement\"), aff'd, 471 U.S. 359 (1985).           Once a child's parents\n\nhave unilaterally removed the child from public school, subsequent\n\nnotice almost a year after removal does little good.\n\n              As the Supreme Court warned almost twenty years ago,\n\n\"parents who unilaterally change their child's placement . . .\n\nwithout the consent of state or local school officials, do so at\n\ntheir own financial risk.\"          Burlington, 471 U.S. at 373-74.      This\n\ncase demonstrates that the Court's admonition remains no less true\n\ntoday.\n\n              The district court also reached the issue whether Katie\n\nshould have been classified as a special needs student in May 2001.\n\nGiven our conclusion that tuition reimbursement is unavailable due\n\nto the parents' lack of notice to the school system while Katie was\n\nenrolled there, the issue whether Greenland should have coded Katie\n\nas disabled in May 2001 is of no moment to this case.\n\n              In fact, the analysis that would be required if we\n\nreached that issue is both difficult and sensitive.           Very helpful\n\namicus briefs, taking opposing views, have been submitted by the\n\nNew Hampshire Association of Special Education Administrators, the\n\nNew Hampshire School Boards Association, and NEA-NH on behalf of\n\nGreenland, and by the Disabilities Rights Center, the New Hampshire\n\nPsychiatric Association, the Asperger's Association of New England,\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\fand the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill on behalf of Katie's\n\nparents.    These briefs point out the complications involved in\n\ndetermining whether any child should be coded as a special needs\n\nchild on a particular date.      They also discuss the concern that\n\nadmirable techniques used in general education can be bootstrapped\n\ninto supporting a special education finding and the converse danger\n\nthat the identification of special needs students will be hidden\n\nbehind the veil that all students receive some individualized\n\ntraining.

No. 105-17, 111 Stat. 37 (1997), reinforced the principle that children should not be removed unnecessarily from regular education environments, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(5)(A), in part by eliminating \"inappropriate financial incentives for referring children to special education.\" H.R. Rep. 105-95, at 90 (1997), <i>reprinted in</i> 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. 78, 87. One specific purpose of the amendments was to control government expenditures for students voluntarily placed in private schools by their parents. <i>See id.</i> at 91-92.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue in this case is whether the parents of Katie C.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> are entitled to reimbursement from the Greenland, New Hampshire School District for Katie's tuition at a private special-needs school, the Learning Skills Academy, for part of the fifth grade and all of the sixth grade. Katie's parents sought tuition reimbursement after having unilaterally removed Katie from Greenland Central School at the end of fourth grade and placed her in private school, without ever before raising with Greenland school officials the issue of special education services for Katie. The district court, reversing the due process hearing officer, held that Katie and her parents were not entitled to such reimbursement. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katie, born in March 1990, started first grade at the Greenland Central School, a public school, in 1996. Although Katie was a good student, her first grade teacher noticed that she had difficulty focusing on classroom activities and was easily distracted. During the summer after first grade, Katie's parents, Mr. and Mrs. N., took Katie to a private psychologist who diagnosed her with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The psychiatrist suggested several practical steps that Katie's teachers could take to counteract her ADHD, including providing her with a checklist of tasks to complete and seating her in the front of the classroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katie's second, third, and fourth grade teachers each used techniques similar to those recommended by Katie's psychiatrist to help Katie stay on task. They sat Katie in the front of the classroom, provided her with a checklist of items she was to complete, and maintained frequent contact with Mrs. N. about Katie's performance. Some of her teachers also employed basic behavior modification techniques to help improve Katie's concentration, such as providing incentives for Katie with stickers. Katie's teachers frequently used these and similar methods to help other students focus too.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. N., who is herself a special education teacher at a nearby high school, also spent a considerable amount of time helping her daughter with her schoolwork. She spent 2-3 hours a night helping Katie with her homework in second grade and provided 3-4 hours of assistance each night in the third grade. By the time Katie was in fourth grade, her parents had hired a tutor to meet with her twice a week.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katie's academic performance during her four years at Greenland ranged from average to above-average. In second grade, Katie was grouped with students who had good reading skills, although she had some difficulties with math. Her second grade teacher viewed Katie as a \"competent learner\" and Katie received a passing grade in all of her subjects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Katie continued to perform reasonably well in third and fourth grades, earning mostly A's and B's on her report card. Katie's third grade teacher viewed her as \"very bright\" and a \"good learner\" and her fourth grade teacher said her academic performance was \"between an eight and a nine\" on a ten-point scale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katie's academic marks were consistent with her scores on the California Achievement Test, a national standardized test that Katie took in the second and fourth grades. On both administrations of the test, Katie scored in the average to above-average range on all of the tested subjects. She also received an average score on all subparts of the New Hampshire End of Grade 3 Assessment, another standardized test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout her time at Greenland, though, Katie still occasionally had difficulty maintaining her concentration on discrete tasks. She also had problems making friends and was sometimes teased by her classmates. In Katie's fourth grade year, Mrs. N. became sufficiently concerned about peer harassment that she contacted Katie's teacher.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At no point during Katie's time at Greenland did her parents or any of her teachers request that she be evaluated for special education services. Katie's second grade teacher noted that Katie did not meet the general profile of a special education student because there was not a gap between her apparent learning ability and her academic performance. Similarly, her third grade teacher said that Katie's difficulties with paying attention were concerns for her physician and that she did not believe that Katie required special education services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August of 2000, the summer that Katie completed fourth grade, Katie's parents unilaterally removed her from the Greenland Central School and enrolled her in Mont Blanc Academy. Mont Blanc Academy is a private school that does not focus on special education students and, when Katie's parents enrolled her there, they \"weren't looking for special education.\" When Katie started fifth grade at Mont Blanc, the school instructed Mrs. N. not to help Katie with her homework. As a result, Katie struggled with some of her classes and failed her first quarter math class, although she passed her other classes. In November, after Mrs. N. learned of Katie's failing math grade, she resumed helping Katie with her homework and Katie's math grade rose to a B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons unspecified in the record, Mont Blanc Academy requested in February of 2001 that Katie's parents withdraw her from the school. One month later, in March of 2001, Katie's parents enrolled her at the Learning Skills Academy (LSA) for the remainder of her fifth grade year. LSA is a private school that has only about thirty enrolled students, most of whom either suffer from a learning disability or ADHD. Tuition for Katie's spring term at LSA was $16,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately the same time that Katie started at LSA, Mrs. N. contacted Melanie Lovering, the special education coordinator for Greenland Central School, and requested that Katie be evaluated by the psychologist on call with the school, Dr. Secor. This was the first time that Katie's parents had notified Greenland that Katie might need special education services. Mrs. N., being a special education teacher and administrator herself, was familiar with the processes associated with identifying children who require special education. Katie's parents told Greenland that their major concerns with Katie's development were focused on \"written language, organization and hyperactivity.\" The school responded by scheduling a \"disposition of referral meeting\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> to take place about two weeks later, on April 6, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the April 6 meeting, three Greenland special education teachers, two representatives from LSA, an occupational therapist, Dr. Secor, Ms. Lovering, and Mrs. N. all met to discuss Katie's eligibility for special education services at Greenland. The group agreed that they did not at that point have sufficient information to determine whether Katie should be coded as learning disabled. Accordingly, they planned a battery of tests and evaluations that Greenland school officials would conduct over the next several weeks to gather more information on Katie's strengths and weaknesses. These included multiple standardized tests in math and written expression and, at Mrs. N.'s request, various psychological assessments by Dr. Secor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 23, 2001, the school district held a meeting with Mrs. N. to assess the results of Katie's tests and evaluations and determine whether Katie was eligible for special education services at Greenland. The school officials in attendance, including Dr. Secor, Ms. Lovering, and four others, unanimously determined that even though Katie had ADHD and an anxiety disorder, those conditions did not adversely affect her educational performance. They also unanimously concluded that Katie did not have a learning disability because there was no evidence of a discrepancy between Katie's ability and her achievement. The officials nonetheless agreed to offer Katie a plan to address some of her organizational weaknesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a letter dated May 29, 2001, Katie's parents informed Michelle Langa, the assistant superintendent of the Greenland School District, that they disagreed with the district's decision finding Katie ineligible for special education services. The letter informed the district that Mr. and Mrs. N. had scheduled an appointment with an independent psychiatrist named Dr. Spitzer, but it did not request any specific further action on the part of Greenland. Again, at the time Katie's parents sent this letter in May 2001, Katie was already in private school, having been withdrawn from public school in August 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Spitzer evaluated Katie in May and sent a letter to Michelle Langa on August 15, 2001 detailing her conclusions. Dr. Spitzer confirmed Katie's diagnosis of ADHD, but she also concluded that Katie suffers from Asperger's disorder. Asperger's disorder is a developmental disability on the autism spectrum that is associated with significant misperceptions of otherwise routine elements of daily life. It is a permanent condition that is not treatable with medication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Katie's parents decided to re-enroll Katie in LSA for sixth grade, the 2001-2002 school year. Katie had done well at LSA during the spring semester of her fifth grade year, making significant strides in her academic and emotional development. She no longer relied on her mother to assist her with her homework, developed positive peer relationships, and was a \"much more confident, happier child.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 12, 2001, as Katie was starting sixth grade at LSA, Greenland school officials met with Dr. Spitzer to review her conclusion that Katie suffered from Asperger's disorder. Although Dr. Secor, who also attended the meeting, disputed this diagnosis, the team decided to reverse its earlier determination that Katie did not qualify for special education services. Rather than code Katie as \"autistic,\" consistent with the diagnosis of Asperger's disorder, the team agreed to code her as \"other health impaired.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next several months, school officials met several times with Mrs. N. and her advocate to develop an Individual Education Plan (IEP) that would provide Katie with appropriate special educational services at Greenland. Throughout this process, Katie remained a student at LSA. By mid-November, the team of school officials, in conjunction with Mrs. N. and her advocate, had developed a working draft of Katie's initial IEP. The draft provided for Katie to re-enroll in Greenland public school and have a personal aide who would assist her with \"social pragmatic skills across a variety of settings and partners\" and help develop her \"graphing and discourse skills.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 15, 2001, as the final details of Katie's IEP were being worked out, Katie's parents filed a due process hearing request. The letter requesting the hearing indicated that Katie's parents appreciated the school's efforts in drafting an IEP for Katie, and explained that they were seeking reimbursement for Katie's tuition at LSA and were concerned that the time for filing a hearing request would soon expire. Although surprised and confused by the due process hearing request, school officials completed the final version of Katie's IEP several weeks later. In addition to providing Katie with services at Greenland, including her own aide, the plan set forth a curriculum to help Katie learn the difference between friendly joking and hurtful teasing, a problem with which children suffering from Asperger's disorder have particular difficulty. It also included counseling services for Katie and speech/language services that Dr. Spitzer had recommended. Even after Greenland completed the IEP, Katie remained enrolled at LSA instead of returning to Greenland and receiving the services outlined in the IEP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Administrative Proceedings</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Mr. and Mrs. N.'s due process hearing request, the hearing officer held a prehearing conference on January 15, 2002. At that conference, the parents said that, in addition to seeking reimbursement, they were challenging the school district's failure to identify Katie as eligible for special education services in May of 2001 (when she was a student at LSA). The parents also indicated that they were dissatisfied with the plan that Greenland had developed in the Fall of 2001 to educate Katie at Greenland because, despite its reliance on an aide to assist Katie, no such aide had been hired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hearing officer heard testimony from sixteen witnesses over three days and issued a decision on February 20, 2002. The decision rejected Greenland's argument that it was not obliged to develop an IEP for Katie because she was unilaterally placed in a private school by her parents; it concluded that Greenland had to offer Katie an IEP pursuant to its \"child find\" obligations. The decision also found that Greenland had erred when in May 2001 it failed to find Katie eligible for special education services. Reasoning that Katie was in effect receiving specialized education throughout her time at Greenland, the hearing officer concluded that the team's reliance on the lack of an apparent gap between Katie's ability and her performance was legally deficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hearing officer also concluded that Katie would be ill-served by returning to Greenland. He found that Greenland did not have any aide or staff with whom it could place Katie if she were to return to the school and that, even if an aide existed, Greenland's proposed IEP would not provide Katie with a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE). Based on these conclusions, the hearing officer ordered Greenland to reimburse Mr. and Mrs. N. for Katie's tuition at LSA for both the second semester of her fifth grade year and the entirety of her sixth grade year. This amounted to $48,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>District Court Decision</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(2), the school district challenged in district court the hearing officer's decision. The district court reversed the bulk of the hearing officer's holdings, concluding that the hearing officer had incorrectly considered the adequacy of the IEP offered by Greenland and the availability of tuition reimbursement. The district court found that Katie was enrolled in private school (Mont Blanc Academy) before her parents ever raised the question of special education and that FAPE was not \"at issue\" when Katie was removed from Greenland. On this basis, the district court concluded that the hearing officer had only the statutory authority to consider whether Greenland had violated its \"child find\" obligation. 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.451.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court affirmed the portion of the hearing officer's opinion that concluded the school district erred in failing to code Katie as a child with a disability in May 2001. Construing that portion of the opinion as stemming from the school district's \"child find\" obligation, the court determined that the hearing officer had the authority to consider the issue. After reviewing the hearing officer's decision on the merits, the court affirmed. Because the district court denied reimbursement on other grounds, this ruling did not affect the plaintiffs' claim for relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katie's parents appeal the portion of the district court's opinion reversing the hearing officer's determinations. Greenland School District cross-appeals, arguing that the district court incorrectly affirmed the hearing officer's determination that Katie should have been coded as a child with a disability in May 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review is de novo, as this case only presents questions of law. <i>Manchester Sch. Dist. v. Crisman,</i> 306 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New Hampshire implements IDEA through its special education law. N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann &#167; 186-C. The state has adopted by reference the federal regulations as to special education for disabled students in private schools. N.H.Code Admin. Rules, Ed. 1117.03 (2003). Thus, Katie's rights under New Hampshire law are the same as her rights under federal law and no greater. <i>See Gary S. v. Manchester Sch. Dist.,</i> 241 F.Supp.2d 111, 122-23 (D.N.H.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case turns on the 1997 IDEA Amendments. Those amendments affect this case in three ways. First, the amendments make clear that while local school systems have \"child find\" obligations as to students with disabilities in private schools, they do not have to provide such students with the full complement of services that a student in public school with special needs would receive. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(10)(A); 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.454(a)(1) (\"No private school child with a disability has an individual right to receive some or all of the special education and related services that the child would receive if enrolled in a public school.\"). Second, they establish that complaints about the services a disabled student in private school is receiving after he or she has been identified must be brought through the state administrative complaint system rather than a due process hearing. 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.457(a), (c). Finally and most importantly, the amendments limit the circumstances in which parents who have unilaterally placed their child in a private school are entitled to reimbursement for that placement. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Obligation to Provide Services to Disabled Private School Children and the Proper Forum for Such Claims.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court vacated the hearing officer's evaluation of the IEP that Greenland offered to Katie because it concluded that this issue was not properly before the hearing officer. That ruling was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Katie was enrolled at LSA, a private school, when she filed her due process hearing request, her rights under IDEA are governed by 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(10). That subsection divides children in private school into two categories: (1) children enrolled in private schools by their parents, and (2) children placed in or referred to private schools by public agencies. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1412(a)(10)(A), (B). It is undisputed that Katie falls in the former category, as she was not placed in or referred to Mont Blanc or LSA by a public agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Participating school districts such as Greenland owe children who fall within subsection (A) of &#167; 1412(a)(10) a \"child find\" obligation. <i>See</i> &#167; 1412(a)(10)(A)(ii). This obligation requires those districts to \"locate, identify and evaluate all private school children with disabilities\" using methods that are \"comparable to activities undertaken for children with disabilities in public school.\" 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.451(b). In the event that a district fails to meet its \"child find\" obligations, a child's parents can initiate a due process hearing under the procedures outlined in &#167;&#167; 300.504-300.515. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 300.457.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, IDEA also provides that participating districts must provide certain services to disabled children in private school once those children have been identified through the child find process. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 300.452-300.462. These services are, not surprisingly, less extensive than the services that a disabled child enrolled in public school is entitled to receive. Not only are the services provided to students in these two settings different in scope, but the procedure for review of claims of a denial of services is also different. Parents of disabled children voluntarily enrolled in private school cannot initiate a due process hearing if they feel their child is not receiving the services required by IDEA. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 300.457(a). Rather, such parents must proceed through an alternative procedure within the state's administrative apparatus. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 300.457(c). As the comments to the draft of the regulations explain:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While there may be legitimate issues regarding the provision of services to a particular parentally-placed private school child with disabilities [that a local education agency] has agreed to serve, due process should not apply, as there is no individual right to these services under the IDEA. Disputes that arise about these services are properly subject to the State complaint procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">64 Fed.Reg. 12406, 12605 (March 12, 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court recognized, any complaints that Katie's parents had regarding Katie's IEP in the fall of 2001 should have been brought through the state complaint process. The adequacy of the IEP was not an appropriate subject for the due process hearing because it had nothing to do with Greenland's child find obligation. Once Greenland identified Katie as a child with a disability in September 2001, the district had performed every act reviewable by a hearing officer; any subsequent obligations it had to provide educational services to Katie were matters for the state administrative procedure, which would apply different standards to evaluate the services provided than did the due process hearing officer. <i>See</i> 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.457(c) (question in state administrative procedure is whether the district met its obligations under &#167;&#167; 300.451-300.462). That decision, moreover, would not be appealable to federal court. <i>See Vultaggio v.

IDEA itself only authorized the district court to \"grant such relief as [it] determine[d] is appropriate.\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(e)(2) (1984), <i>recodified as amended</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(2)(B). In <i>Burlington v. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 471 U.S. 359, 105 S.Ct. 1996, 85 L.Ed.2d 385 (1985), the Supreme Court held that this clause authorized the equitable remedy of tuition reimbursement. <i>See id.</i> at 369, 105 S.Ct. 1996. It noted that the broad language of the statute vested courts with significant discretion to craft appropriate remedies and that, in cases where it would take a significant amount of time for the school to offer appropriate services, the Act's promise of a <i>free</i> appropriate public education could justify the remedy of reimbursement for private school tuition. <i>Id.</i> at 370, 105 S.Ct. 1996. The Court also found that tuition reimbursement was available even in some instances when parents had unilaterally removed their child from public school. <i>Id.</i> at 372, 105 S.Ct. 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Uncertainty about the circumstances under which tuition reimbursement was available remained even after <i>Burlington.</i> Before the 1997 IDEA amendments, several circuits had held that reimbursement for private school tuition depended on the parents cooperating with school authorities in determining the proper placement and educational plan for the child. <i>See Patricia P. v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 203 F.3d 462, 468 (7th Cir.2000) (listing cases interpreting pre-amendment IDEA). As one court noted, \"parents who, because of their failure to cooperate, do not allow a school district a reasonable opportunity to evaluate their disabled child, forfeit their claim for reimbursement for a unilateral private placement.\" <i>Id.</i> at 469. Although few courts precisely defined the level of cooperation necessary, most thought it clear that, at a minimum, the parents had to inform the school district of their concerns about their child's special needs and about the plan proposed before removing the child from public school. <i>See Berger v. Medina City Sch. Dist.,</i> 348 F.3d 513, 523 (6th Cir.2003) (\"Even before the IDEA was amended to explicitly require such notice, this court held that dissatisfied parents were required to complain to the public school to afford the school a chance to remedy the IEP before removing their disabled child from the school.\"); <i>M.C. ex rel. Mrs. C. v. Voluntown Bd. of Educ.,</i> 226 F.3d 60, 68 (2d Cir.2000) (\"[C]ourts have held uniformly that reimbursement is barred where parents unilaterally arrange for private educational services without ever notifying the school board of their dissatisfaction with their child's IEP.\"); <i>Ash v. Lake Oswego Sch. Dist., No. 7J,</i> 980 F.2d 585, 589 (9th Cir.1992); <i>Evans v. District No. 17,</i> 841 F.2d 824, 829 (8th Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1997 Amendments endorsed this line of cases and helped clarify the amount of parental cooperation required by adding a section to IDEA entitled \"Payment for education of children enrolled in private schools without consent of or referral by the public agency.\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C); <i>see</i> H.R. Rep. 105-95, at 93, <i>reprinted in</i> 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. 78, 90. <i>See generally Gary S.,</i> 241 F.Supp.2d at 114-15. That section begins with a general statement of policy explaining that IDEA does not \"require a local education agency to pay for the cost of education, including special education and related services, of a child with a disability at a private school or facility if that agency made a free appropriate public education available to the child and the parents elected to place the child in such private school or facility.\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C)(i). This provision, taken by itself, might be considered ambiguous as applied to a situation where, as here, the local education agency was never informed while the child was in public school that the child might require special education services. But this seeming ambiguity disappears when considered in light of the section's affirmative requirement that \"the parents of a child with a disability, who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency\" can receive reimbursement for their unilateral placement of the child in private school only \"if [a] court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These threshold requirements are key to this case: tuition reimbursement is only available for children who have previously received \"special education and related services\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> while in the public school system (or perhaps<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> those who at least timely requested such services while the child is in public school). There is no dispute that neither Katie's parents nor anyone else requested an evaluation for Katie while she was at Greenland. There is also no dispute that she was removed from Greenland for reasons having nothing to do with any issue about whether Katie was receiving FAPE. Whether some of the techniques used for Katie in the regular classroom (such as the use of checklists) may also be techniques used in special education is beside the point. The point is that there was no notice at all to the school system before Katie's removal from Greenland that there was any issue about whether Katie was in need of special education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even for children who received special education services in the public schools before the private school placement, the 1997 Amendments implemented several additional limitations on reimbursement. Those limitations reinforce our conclusion that Katie and her parents are not eligible for tuition reimbursement. The statute provides that reimbursement may<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> be denied or reduced if the parents do not give the school district notice of their intent to remove their child from public school before they do so. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I); <i>see Rafferty v. Cranston Pub. Sch. Comm.,</i> 315 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir.2002). That notice can be provided either \"at the most recent IEP meeting that the parents attended prior to removal of the child from the public school\" or by written notice ten business days prior to such removal. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I). The statute also creates exceptions to this notice requirement, such as when the parents are illiterate or the child will face physical or serious emotional harm by providing notice. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C)(iv). None of those exceptions is presented here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These statutory provisions make clear Congress's intent that <i>before</i> parents place their child in private school, they must at least give notice to the school that special education is at issue. This serves the important purpose of giving the school system an opportunity, before the child is removed, to assemble a team, evaluate the child, devise an appropriate plan, and determine whether a free appropriate public education can be provided in the public schools. <i>See Patricia P.,</i> 203 F.3d at 468; <i>Schoenfeld v. Parkway Sch. Dist.,</i> 138 F.3d 379, 381-82 (8th Cir.1998); <i>cf. Burlington,</i> 471 U.S. at 373, 105 S.Ct. 1996 (discussing the importance of reviewing a child's educational needs while the child is in the regular public school classroom).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reading IDEA as plaintiffs propose would destroy those safeguards. Here, the parents, well acquainted with IDEA, gave no notice that Katie might need special education services. Indeed, they were not even looking for such services when they removed Katie from public school. Several courts, relying on the parents' failure to challenge the IEP's adequacy, have found insufficient notice to the school district even when the parents requested an evaluation and received an IEP before removing their child. <i>See, e.g., Berger,</i> 348 F.3d at 523-24 (affirming a denial of reimbursement when the child's parents agreed to the IEP proposed by the school and only informed the school district of their concerns after they arranged for the child's enrollment in private school); <i>see also M.C.,</i> 226 F.3d at 68 (denying reimbursement for psychological counseling that the court assumed necessary for the child to benefit from special education because the parents had failed to raise the issue in the child's IEP before the counseling started). If the parents' conduct provided inadequate notice in these cases, then there was clearly insufficient notice here, where the parents never even raised the issue of special education before removing Katie from Greenland.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulations promulgated under IDEA, to which we must give deference, <i>Irving Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Tatro,</i> 468 U.S. 883, 892 &amp; n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 3371, 82 L.Ed.2d 664 (1984), are consistent with our reading of the statute. For the most part, the regulations provide little additional guidance in interpreting the statute because they merely repeat the statute's language. <i>Compare, e.g.,</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C), <i>with</i> 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.403. However, the regulations do provide one interpretive clue by organizing the statutory provisions dealing with reimbursement under the heading \"Children with Disabilities enrolled by their parents in private school when FAPE <i>is at issue.</i>\" <i>See</i> 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.403 (emphasis added). This formulation indicates that the Department of Education views notice as critically important in the statutory scheme: it is difficult to imagine FAPE being \"at issue\" when neither the school nor the child's parents have ever raised the question of FAPE. Even more than the statute, the regulations suggest that a child like Katie who is removed from her school without her parents or her school ever questioning the availability of FAPE is not within the category of children eligible for tuition reimbursement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katie's parents argue that even if they did not give sufficient notice to Greenland for Katie's fifth grade year, they did provide sufficient notice that Katie would be attending LSA by the time of her sixth grade year. Although Greenland was certainly aware that Katie might be attending LSA for the fall semester of her sixth grade year, that fact is beside the point. The purpose of the notice requirement is to give public school districts the opportunity to provide FAPE before a child leaves public school and enrolls in private school. <i>See Patricia P.,</i> 203 F.3d at 468 (emphasizing the importance of cooperation between parents and the school district before the child is removed from public school); <i>Schoenfeld,</i> 138 F.3d at 381-82 (same); <i>Town of Burlington v. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 736 F.2d 773, 799 (1st Cir.1984) (noting the distinction \"between a unilateral parental transfer made after consultation with the school system ... and transfers made truly unilaterally, bereft of any attempt to achieve negotiated compromise and agreement\"), <i>aff'd,</i> 471 U.S. 359, 105 S.Ct. 1996, 85 L.Ed.2d 385 (1985). Once a child's parents have unilaterally removed the child from public school, subsequent notice almost a year after removal does little good.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Supreme Court warned almost twenty years ago, \"parents who unilaterally change their child's placement ... without the consent of state or local school officials, do so at their own financial risk.\" <i>Burlington,</i> 471 U.S. at 373-74, 105 S.Ct. 1996. This case demonstrates that the Court's admonition remains no less true today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also reached the issue whether Katie should have been classified as a special needs student in May 2001. Given our conclusion that tuition reimbursement is unavailable due to the parents' lack of notice to the school system while Katie was enrolled there, the issue whether Greenland should have coded Katie as disabled in May 2001 is of no moment to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the analysis that would be required if we reached that issue is both difficult and sensitive. Very helpful amicus briefs, taking opposing views, have been submitted by the New Hampshire Association of Special Education Administrators, the New Hampshire School Boards Association, and NEA-NH on behalf of Greenland, and by the Disabilities Rights Center, the New Hampshire Psychiatric Association, the Asperger's Association of New England, and the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill on behalf of Katie's parents. These briefs point out the complications involved in determining whether any child should be coded as a special needs child on a particular date. They also discuss the concern that admirable techniques used in general education can be bootstrapped into supporting a special education finding and the converse danger that the identification of special needs students will be hidden behind the veil that all students receive some individualized training. Each side argues that an interpretation going against its position would undercut the provision of services to students in need.

Katie's parents sought tuition reimbursement after having unilaterally removed Katie from Greenland Central School at the end of fourth grade and placed her in private school, without ever before raising with Greenland school officials the issue of special education services for Katie. The district court, reversing the due process hearing officer, held that Katie and her parents were not entitled to such reimbursement. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katie, born in March 1990, started first grade at the Greenland Central School, a public school, in 1996. Although Katie was a good student, her first grade teacher noticed that she had difficulty focusing on classroom activities and was easily distracted. During the summer after first grade, Katie's parents, Mr. and Mrs. N., took Katie to a private psychologist who diagnosed her with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The psychiatrist suggested several practical steps that Katie's teachers could take to counteract her ADHD, including providing her with a checklist of tasks to complete and seating her in the front of the classroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katie's second, third, and fourth grade teachers each used techniques similar to those recommended by Katie's psychiatrist to help Katie stay on task. They sat Katie in the front of the classroom, provided her with a checklist of items she was to complete, and maintained frequent contact with Mrs. N. about Katie's performance. Some of her teachers also employed basic behavior modification techniques to help improve Katie's concentration, such as providing incentives for Katie with stickers. Katie's teachers frequently used these and similar methods to help other students focus too.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. N., who is herself a special education teacher at a nearby high school, also spent a considerable amount of time helping her daughter with her schoolwork. She spent 2-3 hours a night helping Katie with her homework in second grade and provided 3-4 hours of assistance each night in the third grade. By the time Katie was in fourth grade, her parents had hired a tutor to meet with her twice a week.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katie's academic performance during her four years at Greenland ranged from average to above-average. In second grade, Katie was grouped with students who had good reading skills, although she had some difficulties with math. Her second grade teacher viewed Katie as a \"competent learner\" and Katie received a passing grade in all of her subjects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Katie continued to perform reasonably well in third and fourth grades, earning mostly A's and B's on her report card. Katie's third grade teacher viewed her as \"very bright\" and a \"good learner\" and her fourth grade teacher said her academic performance was \"between an eight and a nine\" on a ten-point scale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katie's academic marks were consistent with her scores on the California Achievement Test, a national standardized test that Katie took in the second and fourth grades. On both administrations of the test, Katie scored in the average to above-average range on all of the tested subjects. She also received an average score on all subparts of the New Hampshire End of Grade 3 Assessment, another standardized test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout her time at Greenland, though, Katie still occasionally had difficulty maintaining her concentration on discrete tasks. She also had problems making friends and was sometimes teased by her classmates. In Katie's fourth grade year, Mrs. N. became sufficiently concerned about peer harassment that she contacted Katie's teacher.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At no point during Katie's time at Greenland did her parents or any of her teachers request that she be evaluated for special education services. Katie's second grade teacher noted that Katie did not meet the general profile of a special education student because there was not a gap between her apparent learning ability and her academic performance. Similarly, her third grade teacher said that Katie's difficulties with paying attention were concerns for her physician and that she did not believe that Katie required special education services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August of 2000, the summer that Katie completed fourth grade, Katie's parents unilaterally removed her from the Greenland Central School and enrolled her in Mont Blanc Academy. Mont Blanc Academy is a private school that does not focus on special education students and, when Katie's parents enrolled her there, they \"weren't looking for special education.\" When Katie started fifth grade at Mont Blanc, the school instructed Mrs. N. not to help Katie with her homework. As a result, Katie struggled with some of her classes and failed her first quarter math class, although she passed her other classes. In November, after Mrs. N. learned of Katie's failing math grade, she resumed helping Katie with her homework and Katie's math grade rose to a B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons unspecified in the record, Mont Blanc Academy requested in February of 2001 that Katie's parents withdraw her from the school. One month later, in March of 2001, Katie's parents enrolled her at the Learning Skills Academy (LSA) for the remainder of her fifth grade year. LSA is a private school that has only about thirty enrolled students, most of whom either suffer from a learning disability or ADHD. Tuition for Katie's spring term at LSA was $16,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately the same time that Katie started at LSA, Mrs. N. contacted Melanie Lovering, the special education coordinator for Greenland Central School, and requested that Katie be evaluated by the psychologist on call with the school, Dr. Secor. This was the first time that Katie's parents had notified Greenland that Katie might need special education services. Mrs. N., being a special education teacher and administrator herself, was familiar with the processes associated with identifying children who require special education. Katie's parents told Greenland that their major concerns with Katie's development were focused on \"written language, organization and hyperactivity.\" The school responded by scheduling a \"disposition of referral meeting\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> to take place about two weeks later, on April 6, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the April 6 meeting, three Greenland special education teachers, two representatives from LSA, an occupational therapist, Dr. Secor, Ms. Lovering, and Mrs. N. all met to discuss Katie's eligibility for special education services at Greenland. The group agreed that they did not at that point have sufficient information to determine whether Katie should be coded as learning disabled. Accordingly, they planned a battery of tests and evaluations that Greenland school officials would conduct over the next several weeks to gather more information on Katie's strengths and weaknesses. These included multiple standardized tests in math and written expression and, at Mrs. N.'s request, various psychological assessments by Dr. Secor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 23, 2001, the school district held a meeting with Mrs. N. to assess the results of Katie's tests and evaluations and determine whether Katie was eligible for special education services at Greenland. The school officials in attendance, including Dr. Secor, Ms. Lovering, and four others, unanimously determined that even though Katie had ADHD and an anxiety disorder, those conditions did not adversely affect her educational performance. They also unanimously concluded that Katie did not have a learning disability because there was no evidence of a discrepancy between Katie's ability and her achievement. The officials nonetheless agreed to offer Katie a plan to address some of her organizational weaknesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a letter dated May 29, 2001, Katie's parents informed Michelle Langa, the assistant superintendent of the Greenland School District, that they disagreed with the district's decision finding Katie ineligible for special education services. The letter informed the district that Mr. and Mrs. N. had scheduled an appointment with an independent psychiatrist named Dr. Spitzer, but it did not request any specific further action on the part of Greenland. Again, at the time Katie's parents sent this letter in May 2001, Katie was already in private school, having been withdrawn from public school in August 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Spitzer evaluated Katie in May and sent a letter to Michelle Langa on August 15, 2001 detailing her conclusions. Dr. Spitzer confirmed Katie's diagnosis of ADHD, but she also concluded that Katie suffers from Asperger's disorder. Asperger's disorder is a developmental disability on the autism spectrum that is associated with significant misperceptions of otherwise routine elements of daily life. It is a permanent condition that is not treatable with medication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Katie's parents decided to re-enroll Katie in LSA for sixth grade, the 2001-2002 school year. Katie had done well at LSA during the spring semester of her fifth grade year, making significant strides in her academic and emotional development. She no longer relied on her mother to assist her with her homework, developed positive peer relationships, and was a \"much more confident, happier child.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 12, 2001, as Katie was starting sixth grade at LSA, Greenland school officials met with Dr. Spitzer to review her conclusion that Katie suffered from Asperger's disorder. Although Dr. Secor, who also attended the meeting, disputed this diagnosis, the team decided to reverse its earlier determination that Katie did not qualify for special education services. Rather than code Katie as \"autistic,\" consistent with the diagnosis of Asperger's disorder, the team agreed to code her as \"other health impaired.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next several months, school officials met several times with Mrs. N. and her advocate to develop an Individual Education Plan (IEP) that would provide Katie with appropriate special educational services at Greenland. Throughout this process, Katie remained a student at LSA. By mid-November, the team of school officials, in conjunction with Mrs. N. and her advocate, had developed a working draft of Katie's initial IEP. The draft provided for Katie to re-enroll in Greenland public school and have a personal aide who would assist her with \"social pragmatic skills across a variety of settings and partners\" and help develop her \"graphing and discourse skills.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 15, 2001, as the final details of Katie's IEP were being worked out, Katie's parents filed a due process hearing request. The letter requesting the hearing indicated that Katie's parents appreciated the school's efforts in drafting an IEP for Katie, and explained that they were seeking reimbursement for Katie's tuition at LSA and were concerned that the time for filing a hearing request would soon expire. Although surprised and confused by the due process hearing request, school officials completed the final version of Katie's IEP several weeks later. In addition to providing Katie with services at Greenland, including her own aide, the plan set forth a curriculum to help Katie learn the difference between friendly joking and hurtful teasing, a problem with which children suffering from Asperger's disorder have particular difficulty. It also included counseling services for Katie and speech/language services that Dr. Spitzer had recommended. Even after Greenland completed the IEP, Katie remained enrolled at LSA instead of returning to Greenland and receiving the services outlined in the IEP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Administrative Proceedings</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Mr. and Mrs. N.'s due process hearing request, the hearing officer held a prehearing conference on January 15, 2002. At that conference, the parents said that, in addition to seeking reimbursement, they were challenging the school district's failure to identify Katie as eligible for special education services in May of 2001 (when she was a student at LSA). The parents also indicated that they were dissatisfied with the plan that Greenland had developed in the Fall of 2001 to educate Katie at Greenland because, despite its reliance on an aide to assist Katie, no such aide had been hired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hearing officer heard testimony from sixteen witnesses over three days and issued a decision on February 20, 2002. The decision rejected Greenland's argument that it was not obliged to develop an IEP for Katie because she was unilaterally placed in a private school by her parents; it concluded that Greenland had to offer Katie an IEP pursuant to its \"child find\" obligations. The decision also found that Greenland had erred when in May 2001 it failed to find Katie eligible for special education services. Reasoning that Katie was in effect receiving specialized education throughout her time at Greenland, the hearing officer concluded that the team's reliance on the lack of an apparent gap between Katie's ability and her performance was legally deficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hearing officer also concluded that Katie would be ill-served by returning to Greenland. He found that Greenland did not have any aide or staff with whom it could place Katie if she were to return to the school and that, even if an aide existed, Greenland's proposed IEP would not provide Katie with a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE). Based on these conclusions, the hearing officer ordered Greenland to reimburse Mr. and Mrs. N. for Katie's tuition at LSA for both the second semester of her fifth grade year and the entirety of her sixth grade year. This amounted to $48,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>District Court Decision</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(2), the school district challenged in district court the hearing officer's decision. The district court reversed the bulk of the hearing officer's holdings, concluding that the hearing officer had incorrectly considered the adequacy of the IEP offered by Greenland and the availability of tuition reimbursement. The district court found that Katie was enrolled in private school (Mont Blanc Academy) before her parents ever raised the question of special education and that FAPE was not \"at issue\" when Katie was removed from Greenland. On this basis, the district court concluded that the hearing officer had only the statutory authority to consider whether Greenland had violated its \"child find\" obligation. 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.451.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court affirmed the portion of the hearing officer's opinion that concluded the school district erred in failing to code Katie as a child with a disability in May 2001. Construing that portion of the opinion as stemming from the school district's \"child find\" obligation, the court determined that the hearing officer had the authority to consider the issue. After reviewing the hearing officer's decision on the merits, the court affirmed. Because the district court denied reimbursement on other grounds, this ruling did not affect the plaintiffs' claim for relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katie's parents appeal the portion of the district court's opinion reversing the hearing officer's determinations. Greenland School District cross-appeals, arguing that the district court incorrectly affirmed the hearing officer's determination that Katie should have been coded as a child with a disability in May 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review is de novo, as this case only presents questions of law. <i>Manchester Sch.

Those amendments affect this case in three ways. First, the amendments make clear that while local school systems have \"child find\" obligations as to students with disabilities in private schools, they do not have to provide such students with the full complement of services that a student in public school with special needs would receive. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(10)(A); 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.454(a)(1) (\"No private school child with a disability has an individual right to receive some or all of the special education and related services that the child would receive if enrolled in a public school.\"). Second, they establish that complaints about the services a disabled student in private school is receiving after he or she has been identified must be brought through the state administrative complaint system rather than a due process hearing. 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.457(a), (c). Finally and most importantly, the amendments limit the circumstances in which parents who have unilaterally placed their child in a private school are entitled to reimbursement for that placement. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Obligation to Provide Services to Disabled Private School Children and the Proper Forum for Such Claims.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court vacated the hearing officer's evaluation of the IEP that Greenland offered to Katie because it concluded that this issue was not properly before the hearing officer. That ruling was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Katie was enrolled at LSA, a private school, when she filed her due process hearing request, her rights under IDEA are governed by 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(10). That subsection divides children in private school into two categories: (1) children enrolled in private schools by their parents, and (2) children placed in or referred to private schools by public agencies. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1412(a)(10)(A), (B). It is undisputed that Katie falls in the former category, as she was not placed in or referred to Mont Blanc or LSA by a public agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Participating school districts such as Greenland owe children who fall within subsection (A) of &#167; 1412(a)(10) a \"child find\" obligation. <i>See</i> &#167; 1412(a)(10)(A)(ii). This obligation requires those districts to \"locate, identify and evaluate all private school children with disabilities\" using methods that are \"comparable to activities undertaken for children with disabilities in public school.\" 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.451(b). In the event that a district fails to meet its \"child find\" obligations, a child's parents can initiate a due process hearing under the procedures outlined in &#167;&#167; 300.504-300.515. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 300.457.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, IDEA also provides that participating districts must provide certain services to disabled children in private school once those children have been identified through the child find process. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 300.452-300.462. These services are, not surprisingly, less extensive than the services that a disabled child enrolled in public school is entitled to receive. Not only are the services provided to students in these two settings different in scope, but the procedure for review of claims of a denial of services is also different. Parents of disabled children voluntarily enrolled in private school cannot initiate a due process hearing if they feel their child is not receiving the services required by IDEA. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 300.457(a). Rather, such parents must proceed through an alternative procedure within the state's administrative apparatus. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 300.457(c). As the comments to the draft of the regulations explain:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While there may be legitimate issues regarding the provision of services to a particular parentally-placed private school child with disabilities [that a local education agency] has agreed to serve, due process should not apply, as there is no individual right to these services under the IDEA. Disputes that arise about these services are properly subject to the State complaint procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">64 Fed.Reg. 12406, 12605 (March 12, 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court recognized, any complaints that Katie's parents had regarding Katie's IEP in the fall of 2001 should have been brought through the state complaint process. The adequacy of the IEP was not an appropriate subject for the due process hearing because it had nothing to do with Greenland's child find obligation. Once Greenland identified Katie as a child with a disability in September 2001, the district had performed every act reviewable by a hearing officer; any subsequent obligations it had to provide educational services to Katie were matters for the state administrative procedure, which would apply different standards to evaluate the services provided than did the due process hearing officer. <i>See</i> 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.457(c) (question in state administrative procedure is whether the district met its obligations under &#167;&#167; 300.451-300.462).

Rep. 105-95, at 93, <i>reprinted in</i> 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. 78, 90. <i>See generally Gary S.,</i> 241 F.Supp.2d at 114-15. That section begins with a general statement of policy explaining that IDEA does not \"require a local education agency to pay for the cost of education, including special education and related services, of a child with a disability at a private school or facility if that agency made a free appropriate public education available to the child and the parents elected to place the child in such private school or facility.\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C)(i). This provision, taken by itself, might be considered ambiguous as applied to a situation where, as here, the local education agency was never informed while the child was in public school that the child might require special education services. But this seeming ambiguity disappears when considered in light of the section's affirmative requirement that \"the parents of a child with a disability, who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency\" can receive reimbursement for their unilateral placement of the child in private school only \"if [a] court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These threshold requirements are key to this case: tuition reimbursement is only available for children who have previously received \"special education and related services\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> while in the public school system (or perhaps<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> those who at least timely requested such services while the child is in public school). There is no dispute that neither Katie's parents nor anyone else requested an evaluation for Katie while she was at Greenland. There is also no dispute that she was removed from Greenland for reasons having nothing to do with any issue about whether Katie was receiving FAPE. Whether some of the techniques used for Katie in the regular classroom (such as the use of checklists) may also be techniques used in special education is beside the point. The point is that there was no notice at all to the school system before Katie's removal from Greenland that there was any issue about whether Katie was in need of special education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even for children who received special education services in the public schools before the private school placement, the 1997 Amendments implemented several additional limitations on reimbursement. Those limitations reinforce our conclusion that Katie and her parents are not eligible for tuition reimbursement. The statute provides that reimbursement may<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> be denied or reduced if the parents do not give the school district notice of their intent to remove their child from public school before they do so. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I); <i>see Rafferty v. Cranston Pub. Sch. Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200256\"><a href=\"/opinion/200256/rafferty-v-cranston-school-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.2002). That notice can be provided either \"at the most recent IEP meeting that the parents attended prior to removal of the child from the public school\" or by written notice ten business days prior to such removal. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I). The statute also creates exceptions to this notice requirement, such as when the parents are illiterate or the child will face physical or serious emotional harm by providing notice. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C)(iv). None of those exceptions is presented here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These statutory provisions make clear Congress's intent that <i>before</i> parents place their child in private school, they must at least give notice to the school that special education is at issue. This serves the important purpose of giving the school system an opportunity, before the child is removed, to assemble a team, evaluate the child, devise an appropriate plan, and determine whether a free appropriate public education can be provided in the public schools. <i>See Patricia P.,</i> 203 F.3d at 468; <i>Schoenfeld v.

Here, the parents, well acquainted with IDEA, gave no notice that Katie might need special education services. Indeed, they were not even looking for such services when they removed Katie from public school. Several courts, relying on the parents' failure to challenge the IEP's adequacy, have found insufficient notice to the school district even when the parents requested an evaluation and received an IEP before removing their child. <i>See, e.g., Berger,</i> 348 F.3d at 523-24 (affirming a denial of reimbursement when the child's parents agreed to the IEP proposed by the school and only informed the school district of their concerns after they arranged for the child's enrollment in private school); <i>see also M.C.,</i> 226 F.3d at 68 (denying reimbursement for psychological counseling that the court assumed necessary for the child to benefit from special education because the parents had failed to raise the issue in the child's IEP before the counseling started). If the parents' conduct provided inadequate notice in these cases, then there was clearly insufficient notice here, where the parents never even raised the issue of special education before removing Katie from Greenland.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulations promulgated under IDEA, to which we must give deference, <i>Irving Indep.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span> (1984), are consistent with our reading of the statute. For the most part, the regulations provide little additional guidance in interpreting the statute because they merely repeat the statute's language. <i>Compare, e.g.,</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(10)(C), <i>with</i> 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.403. However, the regulations do provide one interpretive clue by organizing the statutory provisions dealing with reimbursement under the heading \"Children with Disabilities enrolled by their parents in private school when FAPE <i>is at issue.</i>\" <i>See</i> 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.403 (emphasis added). This formulation indicates that the Department of Education views notice as critically important in the statutory scheme: it is difficult to imagine FAPE being \"at issue\" when neither the school nor the child's parents have ever raised the question of FAPE. Even more than the statute, the regulations suggest that a child like Katie who is removed from her school without her parents or her school ever questioning the availability of FAPE is not within the category of children eligible for tuition reimbursement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katie's parents argue that even if they did not give sufficient notice to Greenland for Katie's fifth grade year, they did provide sufficient notice that Katie would be attending LSA by the time of her sixth grade year. Although Greenland was certainly aware that Katie might be attending LSA for the fall semester of her sixth grade year, that fact is beside the point. The purpose of the notice requirement is to give public school districts the opportunity to provide FAPE before a child leaves public school and enrolls in private school. <i>See Patricia P.,</i> 203 F.3d at 468 (emphasizing the importance of cooperation between parents and the school district before the child is removed from public school); <i>Schoenfeld,</i> 138 F.3d at 381-82 (same); <i>Town of Burlington v.

Once a child's parents have unilaterally removed the child from public school, subsequent notice almost a year after removal does little good.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Supreme Court warned almost twenty years ago, \"parents who unilaterally change their child's placement ... without the consent of state or local school officials, do so at their own financial risk.\" <i>Burlington,</i> 471 U.S. at 373-74, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111420\"><a href=\"/opinion/111420/burlington-school-comm-v-mass-dept-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Given our conclusion that tuition reimbursement is unavailable due to the parents' lack of notice to the school system while Katie was enrolled there, the issue whether Greenland should have coded Katie as disabled in May 2001 is of no moment to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the analysis that would be required if we reached that issue is both difficult and sensitive. Very helpful amicus briefs, taking opposing views, have been submitted by the New Hampshire Association of Special Education Administrators, the New Hampshire School Boards Association, and NEA-NH on behalf of Greenland, and by the Disabilities Rights Center, the New Hampshire Psychiatric Association, the Asperger's Association of New England, and the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill on behalf of Katie's parents. These briefs point out the complications involved in determining whether any child should be coded as a special needs child on a particular date. They also discuss the concern that admirable techniques used in general education can be bootstrapped into supporting a special education finding and the converse danger that the identification of special needs students will be hidden behind the veil that all students receive some individualized training. Each side argues that an interpretation going against its position would undercut the provision of services to students in need. This is an extremely important and nuanced question of law that we leave for another day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Affirmed.</i> Costs are awarded to Greenland.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The captioned plaintiffs in this case, Amy N. and Robert N., are Katie C.'s parents</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Second grade students at Greenland do not receive a letter or number grade, but instead simply \"pass\" or \"fail.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> A \"disposition of referral meeting\" is a procedure used by Greenland following a request to determine whether a particular child is eligible for special education services</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Katie's parents do not make a claim for compensatory services for past inadequacies<i>Cf.
