In this case, two construction\n\nworkers’ unions claim that the federal and Maine departments of\n\nlabor applied an erroneous statutory standard when making the\n\ndecision to approve sixty temporary work certifications for foreign\n\nworkers.     We assume that this allegation is true for purposes of\n\ndeciding whether that one-time error may form the basis for the\n\nrequested declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\n             The district court’s decision sets forth the background\n\nof the case in full, see Maine State Building and Construction\n\nTrades Council, AFL-CIO v. Chao, 265 F. Supp. 2d 105, 107-110 (D.\n\nMe. 2003).      A précis of the facts is sufficient for our purposes.\n\nThe dispute centers on the construction of two oil rigs in the\n\nharbor of Portland, Maine.          Between August and October of 2002,\n\nCianbro Corporation (“Cianbro”), an industrial contractor, applied\n\nto the United States Department of Labor (“U.S. DOL”) and the Maine\n\nDepartment      of   Labor   (“Maine    DOL”)   for   H-2B      temporary      labor\n\ncertifications for approximately one hundred and twenty foreigners\n\nto be employed as structural and pipe welders on the rigs.                  Before\n\nissuing the      certifications,       the   U.S.   DOL   and   Maine    DOL   were\n\nrequired   to    calculate    the   prevailing      wages    for   the   jobs    in\n\nquestion, in order to ensure that such workers would not be paid\n\nwages less than those paid to American workers.                 See 20 C.F.R. §\n\n656.40.    This they did by using a wage calculus set forth in the\n\nMcNamara-O’Hara Service Contract Act (“SCA”), 41 U.S.C. §§ 351-358,\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fand related regulations.   That was a mistake.      The wage rate should\n\nhave been calculated by reference to the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 3141-3148, rather than the SCA.1    Although notified of the error\n\nby letter, the U.S. DOL did not rectify the problem before issuing\n\ntemporary labor certifications to Cianbro for the admission of\n\nfifty pipe welders and ten structural welders.         Armed with these\n\ncertifications, Cianbro filed a petition with the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization   Service   (“INS”)2   for   the   issuance   of   the   H-2B\n\ntemporary work visas to the certified foreign employees.          On April\n\n1, 2003, the INS approved Cianbro’s applications for twenty-three\n\nbeneficiaries.\n\n          During the pendency of the INS petition, the Maine State\n\nBuilding and Construction Trades Council, AFL-CIO, and the Building\n\nand Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO (“the Unions”) brought\n\n\n\n     1\n       There is some discrepancy in the record about the nature of\nthe mistake and whether, in fact, there actually was any mistake.\nThe district court found that both the Maine DOL and U.S. DOL\napplied the SCA to calculate the prevailing rate.       The record\nreflects, however, that the Maine DOL applied the SCA, but that the\nU.S. DOL found both the SCA and Davis-Bacon Act inapposite. The\nU.S. DOL appears to have applied a third standard, the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics’ “Occupational Employment Statistics.” Whether\nthe formula used by the U.S. DOL was derived from the SCA or some\nother source, however, is ultimately irrelevant, because all agree\nthat, for purposes of this appeal, the Davis-Bacon Act should have\nbeen used, but was not.\n     2\n       Since this action was filed, the INS has been renamed the\nBureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. See 6 U.S.C. §\n271. All court filings, however, reflect that the operative events\nin this case occurred before the official change in title, and we\ntherefore refer to the agency as the INS.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthis action against the U.S. DOL, Elaine Chao, in her official\n\ncapacity as the Secretary of Labor, the United States Attorney\n\nGeneral,   the   United    States   Department      of   Justice,     and   the\n\nCommissioner of the INS (collectively “the Government”).                    The\n\nUnions sought a declaration that the U.S. DOL’s use of the SCA, as\n\nopposed to the Davis-Bacon Act, to calculate the prevailing wage\n\nrate was arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion and not\n\nin accordance with the law.         They also requested an injunction\n\nrequiring rescission of the temporary labor certifications issued\n\nto   Cianbro,    and    barring   the   Attorney    General    and    the   INS\n\nCommissioner     from     issuing   the    work     visas     based   on    the\n\ncertifications.\n\n           The district court3 denied the Unions’ application for a\n\ntemporary restraining order, finding that it lacked jurisdiction to\n\naffect any decision or action of the Attorney General or INS\n\nCommissioner in connection with the H-2B visa application.                  The\n\ncourt also held that the Unions lacked standing to seek the\n\nrequested relief. The Government subsequently moved to dismiss the\n\ncase under Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for\n\nlack of subject-matter jurisdiction, standing, and ripeness, as\n\nwell as for failure to state a claim.              The Unions opposed this\n\ndismissal motion and filed concurrently a motion to amend their\n\n\n     3\n        The parties consented to Magistrate Judge Cohen’s\njurisdiction over the entire case, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n73(b) and 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).\n\n                                    -4-\n\fcomplaint to allege a second cause of action which, they hoped,\n\nwould cure the flaws of the first.       This new cause of action\n\nchallenged “as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and\n\notherwise not in accordance with law” the DOL’s alleged\n\n            pattern and practice of disregard . . . of its\n            responsibility under its own regulations to\n            consider whether the wage stated in an\n            application for a labor certification for a\n            job opportunity is in an occupation that is\n            subject to a wage determination under the\n            Davis-Bacon Act . . . .\n\nMaine State Building and Construction Trades Council, 265 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 111 (citing Proposed Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 51-52).           The\n\ndistrict court granted the Government’s motion to dismiss, finding\n\nthat the case was moot because the H-2B visas had already issued.\n\nFurthermore, the district court denied the Unions’ motion to amend\n\ntheir complaint, holding that they lacked standing to press their\n\nclaims and failed to state a claim upon which relief could be\n\ngranted.    We review both the dismissal of the original complaint\n\nand the decision of the district court to deny the Unions’ motion\n\nto amend.\n\n            Our review of a dismissal on the grounds of mootness is\n\nde novo.    Maine School Admin. Dist. No. 35 v. Mr. and Mrs. R., 321\n\nF.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir. 2003).   “Even if an actual case or controversy\n\nexists at the inception of litigation, a case may be rendered moot\n\n(and, therefore, subject to dismissal) if changed circumstances\n\neliminate any possibility of effectual relief.”      Id.     Where the\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\frelief sought is injunctive in nature, “this ordinarily means that\n\nonce the act sought to be enjoined occurs, the suit must be\n\ndismissed as moot.”   Id.\n\n           The complaint, as originally filed, seeks relief only\n\nwith respect to the U.S. DOL’s treatment of Cianbro’s application,\n\nand that relief is now moot.      The temporary labor certifications\n\nand H-2B visas have already issued; there is nothing to enjoin.       In\n\nresisting disposition on this ground, the Unions purport to rely on\n\nour decision in Allende v. Shultz, 845 F.2d 1111 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\nWe were confronted there with an allegedly unlawful, official\n\nimmigration policy, and concluded that “[a]lthough the specific\n\napplication of that policy against Allende in March 1983 is moot,\n\nthe validity of that policy in general remains a live controversy.”\n\nId. at 1115 n.7.   Unlike Allende, however, there is no such policy\n\nof general application, whether explicit or tacit, identified in\n\nthe original complaint.     Once the labor certifications and H-2B\n\nvisas issued, there was no longer any case or controversy to\n\ndecide.\n\n           Anticipating defeat on this issue, the Unions advance an\n\nalternative   position:   they   concede   the   possibility   that   the\n\nCianbro-related allegations are moot, but invoke the exception to\n\nthe mootness rule for actions “capable of repetition, yet evading\n\nreview.”   Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U.S. 147, 149, 96 S. Ct. 347,\n\n46 L. Ed. 2d 350 (1975).     “In order to qualify for this narrow\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fexception to the mootness doctrine, a plaintiff must show that ‘(1)\n\nthe challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully\n\nlitigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there was\n\na reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be\n\nsubjected to the same action again.’”            Gulf of Maine Fisherman’s\n\nAlliance   v.   Daley,   292   F.3d   84,   89   (1st   Cir.   2002)   (citing\n\nWeinstein, 423 U.S. at 149).\n\n           Though their position as to the first prong is not\n\nentirely without merit,4 the Unions have not alleged any factual\n\nbasis for the claim that they will be victimized by the same error\n\never again.     Bromides about the American worker’s potential for\n\nfuture job losses are unavailing without some concrete allegations\n\nthat the Government is likely to repeat its miscalculation of the\n\nprevailing wage rate by using the wrong standard. Thus, the Unions\n\nfail to meet the standard for likelihood of repetition.\n\n\n     4\n       The Unions were notified of the issuance of the temporary\nlabor certifications on February 5, 2003. Cianbro’s petition for\nH-2B visas was received at the Vermont Service Center of the INS on\nMarch 21, 2003, and approved on April 1, 2003. The Unions filed\ntheir complaint and application for a temporary restraining order\non March 21, 2003, informing the court that speed was of the\nessence because of the imminent INS action. Although the court did\nenter an order denying the request for a temporary restraining\norder prior to the INS’ approval of the visas, it cannot be said\nthat the Unions’ case was “fully litigated” by that time. It is\ndoubtful, even under expedited review, that this case could have\nbeen fully litigated within a matter of weeks. Cf. Gulf of Maine\nFishermen’s Alliance, 292 F.3d at 89 (one year was a sufficient\nperiod of time within which the case could have been fully\nlitigated; the losing party therefore could not satisfy the first\nprong of the “capable of repetition, yet evading review”\nexception).\n\n                                      -7-\n\f          Their first complaint reduced to ashes, the Unions seek\n\nto have it rise like a phoenix in their motion to amend.        The\n\namendment, which the district court rejected, merely inserted the\n\nwords “pattern and practice” into the same aggregate of factual\n\nclaims set forth in the first complaint.     “We review denials of\n\nleave to amend under Rule 15 for abuse of discretion, deferring to\n\nthe district court for any adequate reason apparent from the\n\nrecord.” Resolution Trust Corp. v. Gold, 30 F.3d 251, 253 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).   There is adequate reason in ample supply.      The Unions\n\ncannot construct a “pattern and practice” complaint simply by\n\nchanging the label on the package.   Nothing other than the Cianbro\n\nincident is offered to support the conclusory statement that the\n\nGovernment has a practice of “disregarding its obligation to comply\n\nwith its own regulations.”    Motion to Amend, at 2.    Though the\n\ncourt denied the amendment for “failure to state a claim for which\n\nrelief can be granted,” what it more precisely intended was a\n\ndenial on the basis of futility.     See, e.g., Hatch v. Department\n\nFor Children, Youth and Their Families, 274 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (“We view the court’s exercise of discretion in this area of\n\nthe law through the prism of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a),\n\nwhich indicates that leave to amend a complaint ‘shall be freely\n\ngiven when justice so requires.’   In practice, this means that the\n\ndenial of such a motion will be upheld so long as the record\n\nevinces an arguably adequate basis for the court’s decision (e.g.,\n\n\n                               -8-\n\ffutility, bad faith, undue delay, or a dilatory motive on the\n\nmovant’s part).”).    Because this amendment sets forth no scenario\n\nthat would entitle the Unions to the requested relief, we find that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in denying as\n\nfutile the Unions’ motion to amend.        This ruling is without\n\nprejudice to the Unions’ right to bring a new pattern and practice\n\naction in the future based on identified facts that justify it.\n\nGiven this outcome, it is unnecessary for us to review the district\n\ncourt’s disposition of the case based on lack of subject-matter\n\njurisdiction or lack of the Unions’ standing.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f",

Between August and October of 2002, Cianbro Corporation (\"Cianbro\"), an industrial contractor, applied to the United States Department of Labor (\"U.S. DOL\") and the Maine Department of Labor (\"Maine DOL\") for H-2B temporary labor certifications for approximately one hundred and twenty foreigners to be employed as structural and pipe welders on the rigs. Before issuing the certifications, the U.S. DOL and Maine DOL were required to calculate the prevailing wages for the jobs in question, in order to ensure that such workers would not be paid wages less than those paid to American workers. <i>See</i> 20 C.F.R. &#167; 656.40.

Chao,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2459270\"><a href=\"/opinion/2459270/maine-state-bldg-and-const-trades-council-v-chao/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 107-110 (D.Me.2003). A pr&#233;cis of the facts is sufficient for our purposes. The dispute centers on the construction of two oil rigs in the harbor of Portland, Maine. Between August and October of 2002, Cianbro Corporation (\"Cianbro\"), an industrial contractor, applied to the United States Department of Labor (\"U.S. DOL\") and the Maine Department of Labor (\"Maine DOL\") for H-2B temporary labor certifications for approximately one hundred and twenty foreigners to be employed as structural and pipe welders on the rigs. Before issuing the certifications, the U.S. DOL and Maine DOL were required to calculate the prevailing wages for the jobs in question, in order to ensure that such workers would not be paid wages less than those paid to American workers. <i>See</i> 20 C.F.R. &#167; 656.40. This they did by using a wage calculus set forth in the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act (\"SCA\"), 41 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 351-358, and related regulations. That was a mistake. The wage rate should have been calculated by reference to the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3141-3148, rather than the SCA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Although notified of the error by letter, the U.S. DOL did not rectify the problem before issuing temporary labor certifications to Cianbro for the admission of fifty pipe welders and ten structural welders. Armed with these certifications, Cianbro filed a petition with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> for the issuance of the H-2B temporary work visas to the certified foreign employees. On April 1, 2003, the INS approved Cianbro's applications for twenty-three beneficiaries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the pendency of the INS petition, the Maine State Building and Construction Trades Council, AFL-CIO, and the Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO (\"the Unions\") brought this action against the U.S. DOL, Elaine Chao, in her official capacity as the Secretary of Labor, the United States Attorney General, the United States Department of Justice, and the Commissioner of the INS (collectively \"the Government\"). The Unions sought a declaration that the U.S. DOL's use of the SCA, as opposed to the Davis-Bacon Act, to calculate the prevailing wage rate was arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion and not in accordance with the law. They also requested an injunction requiring rescission of the temporary labor certifications issued to Cianbro, and barring the Attorney General and the INS Commissioner from issuing the work visas based on the certifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> denied the Unions' application for a temporary restraining order, finding that it lacked jurisdiction to affect any decision or action of the Attorney General or INS Commissioner in connection with the H-2B visa application. The court also held that the Unions lacked standing to seek the requested relief. The Government subsequently moved to dismiss the case under Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, standing, and ripeness, as well as for failure to state a claim. The Unions opposed this dismissal motion and filed concurrently a motion to amend their complaint to allege a second cause of action which, they hoped, would cure the flaws of the first. This new cause of action challenged \"as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with law\" the DOL's alleged</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">pattern and practice of disregard ... of its responsibility under its own regulations to consider whether the wage stated in an application for a labor certification for a job opportunity is in an occupation that is subject to a wage determination under the Davis-Bacon Act....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Maine State Building and Construction Trades Council,</i> 265 F.Supp.2d at 111 (citing Proposed Amended Complaint, &#182;&#182; 51-52). The district court granted the Government's motion to dismiss, finding that the case was moot because the H-2B visas had already issued. Furthermore, the district court denied the Unions' motion to amend their complaint, holding that they lacked standing to press their claims and failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
