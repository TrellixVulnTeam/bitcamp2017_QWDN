Pro se plaintiff-appellant Nathaniel Cooper\n\n(\"Cooper\") appeals from the dismissal of his second complaint\n\nagainst the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (\"VA\")\n\nbased upon res judicata.   We review the dismissal of a complaint on\n\nres judicata grounds de novo.    See, e.g., Apparel Art Int'l, Inc.\n\nv. Amertex Enters. Ltd., 48 F.3d 576, 583 (1st Cir. 1995).     We are\n\nobligated to construe a pro se complaint liberally, Ayala Serrano\n\nv. Lebron Gonzales, 909 F.2d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 1990), treating all\n\nwell-pleaded factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable\n\ninferences in the plaintiff's favor, Aversa v. United States, 99\n\nF.3d 1200, 1210 (1st Cir. 1996).        After carefully reviewing the\n\nparties' briefs and the record, we affirm the dismissal of the\n\npresent complaint for the reasons stated below.\n\n     Under the federal doctrine of res judicata, \"a final judgment\n\non the merits of an action precludes the parties from relitigating\n\nclaims that were raised or could have been raised in that action.\"\n\nSee, e.g., Bay State HMO Mgmt., Inc. v. Tingley Sys., Inc., 181\n\nF.3d 174, 177 (1st Cir. 1999).   \"For a claim to be precluded, there\n\nmust be: (1) a final judgment on the merits in an earlier action;\n\n(2) sufficient identity between the causes of action asserted in\n\nthe earlier and later suits; and (3) sufficient identity between\n\nthe parties in the two suits.\"    Id.    We briefly address the lower\n\ncourt's ruling regarding each element.\n\n     First, the lower court determined that a final judgment on the\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fmerits had been rendered in the earlier suit.                         The court had\n\ndismissed the claims in the first suit as either time-barred under\n\nthe applicable statutory limitations periods or precluded by the\n\nCivil Service Reform Act (\"CSRA\"), 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.                      It is\n\nwell-settled that a dismissal on statute-of-limitations grounds is\n\na judgment \"on the merits.\"           See Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc.,\n\n514 U.S. 211, 228 (1995).                 Even though the magistrate judge\n\nrecommended and the district court approved that Cooper's first\n\nsuit   be    dismissed     \"without       prejudice,\"   we    have     held   that    a\n\ndismissal labeled \"without prejudice\" is, in fact, \"with prejudice\"\n\nif the statute of limitations has run.               Hilton Int'l Co. v. Union\n\nDe Trabajadores De La Industria Gastronomica De Puerto Rico, 833\n\nF.2d 10, 11 (1st Cir. 1987).          Therefore, the dismissal of the time-\n\nbarred      claims   constituted      a     final   judgment     on    the    merits,\n\nsatisfying the first res judicata element.\n\n       With respect to the claims held to be precluded by the CSRA,\n\ntheir dismissal       rested   on     the    fact   that   the   federal      statute\n\npreempted Cooper's lawsuit and barred him from litigating those\n\nclaims in that forum.        The lower court, in effect, lacked subject\n\nmatter      jurisdiction    over    the     CSRA    claims.      See    Berrios      v.\n\nDepartment of the Army, 884 F.2d 28, 31-32 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\nAlthough a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is not considered to\n\nbe \"on the merits,\" see Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b), and, thus, does not\n\neffect a merger or bar based on the prior claims, the doctrine of\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fcollateral estoppel prevented the court from rehearing the issue of\n\npreemption.   See Muniz Cortes v. Intermedics, Inc., 229 F.3d 12,\n\n14-15 (1st Cir. 2000) (noting that dismissal for lack of subject\n\nmatter   jurisdiction   \"precludes    relitigation     of   the   issues\n\ndetermined in ruling on the jurisdictional question\"). Because the\n\nissue of CSRA's preemption could not be relitigated, the CSRA\n\npreempts these same claims in the second suit.       Moreover, although\n\nthe dismissal of the first suit was labeled \"without prejudice,\" it\n\nis \"with prejudice\" with respect to the issues that were decided in\n\nthe first suit.   See, e.g., In re Kauffman Mut. Fund Actions, 479\n\nF.2d 257, 267 (1st Cir. 1973) (holding that dismissal \"without\n\nprejudice\" still bars relitigation of \"very question which was\n\nlitigated in the prior action\").     Accordingly, we uphold the lower\n\ncourt's dismissal of Cooper's CSRA claims under the doctrine of\n\ncollateral estoppel (or issue preclusion), without determining\n\nwhether the merger and bar branch of res judicata (or claim\n\npreclusion) applies to a dismissal based on preemption. See, e.g.,\n\nFour Corners Serv. Station, Inc. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 51 F.3d 306,\n\n314 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that appellate court is free to affirm\n\ndistrict court judgment on any ground supported by the record).\n\n     Next, the lower court determined that all of the claims\n\nasserted by Cooper in the second suit were asserted, or could have\n\nbeen asserted, in the earlier suit because both causes of action\n\narose as a result of Cooper's removal from his job.               In our\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fcircuit, for res judicata purposes, a cause of action embraces the\n\nvarious possible claims derivable from \"a set of facts which can be\n\ncharacterized     as   a    single    transaction    or    series    of   related\n\ntransactions.\"    Apparel Art Int'l, Inc., 48 F.3d at 583.                The test\n\nto determine the identity of two causes of action for purposes of\n\nres judicata is whether the essential or operative facts are the\n\nsame in both cases.        Massachusetts Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v.\n\nAmerican Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 38 (1st Cir. 1998).                   In making\n\nthis determination, courts consider various factors, such as (1)\n\nwhether the facts are related in time, space, origin or motivation,\n\n(2) whether they form a convenient trial unit, and (3) whether\n\ntheir treatment as a unit conforms to the parties' expectations.\n\nId.   This test does not require identity of legal theory.                 Porn v.\n\nNational Grange Mut. Ins. Co., 93 F.3d 31, 34 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(noting that \"[t]he mere fact that different legal theories are\n\npresented in each case does not mean that the same transaction is\n\nnot behind each\").\n\n      The lower court correctly determined that both actions arose\n\nfrom Cooper's 1994 removal from his federal job.                    A comparison\n\nbetween the first complaint and the present complaint reveals many\n\nof the same claims.          The lower court noted two of them: Both\n\ncomplaints alleged that the VA's actions resulted in damage to\n\nCooper's credit rating, and both asserted that the VA disseminated\n\nfalse   medical   information        which,   in   turn,   adversely      affected\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fCooper's employment.       Both complaints also alleged that the VA\n\nunjustly recouped severance payments under false pretenses and\n\nwithout a hearing.\n\n       Cooper's new claims are merely additional complaints about the\n\nVA's actions following his removal.           Cooper asserts that the VA\n\ndenied him vocational retraining and tampered with his files to\n\ndelay the processing of his retraining benefits. Cooper also seeks\n\nreimbursement of tuition he paid out-of-pocket because of the\n\ndenial of vocational retraining.        The lower court determined that\n\nall of these claims appeared to relate to Cooper's job removal, and\n\nwere factually similar in time, origin and motivation.                  This\n\ndetermination was proper.       Cooper's claim to entitlement to VA\n\nvocational    retraining   benefits,    and    his   allegations   of   file\n\ntampering, would not have arisen had he not been removed from his\n\njob.    Moreover, Cooper's own statements evidence the identity of\n\nhis two causes of action.     In his first suit, Cooper specifically\n\nalleged that the VA committed various acts against him in reprisal\n\nfor his whistleblowing activities.       Thus, Cooper took the position\n\nthat the VA's adverse actions were directly related to each other\n\nin terms of the VA's motivation and common purpose to retaliate\n\nagainst him.    See, e.g., Havercombe v. Department of Educ., 250\n\nF.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding that separate causes of action\n\nalleging various improper acts by employer added up to single claim\n\nof workplace harassment).      Although Cooper asserts in his reply\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fbrief that he was not removed from his job, but, rather, did not\n\nreturn to his job because of an ankle injury, this assertion is\n\nbelied by statements in Cooper's initial brief, where he asserted\n\nthat he \"was separated from the military under false pretenses\"\n\nbecause he had \"made protected whistle-blowing disclosures.\"\n\n     In sum, Cooper's claims in both suits seek redress for the\n\nsame wrong: his removal from his job.    There is no reason why the\n\nnew claims in the present suit could not have been raised in the\n\nearlier action.   Cooper was in possession of all the facts on which\n\nhis new claims were based before filing his first action.      See,\n\ne.g., Massachusetts Sch. of Law, 142 F.3d at 38 (noting that\n\nplaintiff \"d[id] not identify any significant facts that were not\n\nwithin its ken before the [first] action reached its climax\" in\n\nupholding res judicata bar to second action).      Accordingly, the\n\nlower court was correct in finding that there was sufficient\n\nidentity between the causes of action asserted in the two suits to\n\nsatisfy the second element of res judicata.\n\n     Lastly, the lower court determined that the parties in both\n\ncases were identical.     The record demonstrates that Cooper named\n\nthe VA as a defendant in both of his lawsuits.       Therefore, the\n\nlower court was correct in finding that this last element of res\n\njudicata was satisfied.    Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of\n\nthe present suit.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f",

The test\n\nto determine the identity of two causes of action for purposes of\n\nres judicata is whether the essential or operative facts are the\n\nsame in both cases.

In making\n\nthis determination, courts consider various factors, such as (1)\n\nwhether the facts are related in time, space, origin or motivation,\n\n(2) whether they form a convenient trial unit, and (3) whether\n\ntheir treatment as a unit conforms to the parties' expectations.\n\nId.   This test does not require identity of legal theory.                 Porn v.\n\nNational Grange Mut. Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196943\"><a href=\"/opinion/196943/porn-v-national-grange/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 34 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(noting that \"[t]he mere fact that different legal theories are\n\npresented in each case does not mean that the same transaction is\n\nnot behind each\").\n\n      The lower court correctly determined that both actions arose\n\nfrom Cooper's 1994 removal from his federal job.                    A comparison\n\nbetween the first complaint and the present complaint reveals many\n\nof the same claims.          The lower court noted two of them: Both\n\ncomplaints alleged that the VA's actions resulted in damage to\n\nCooper's credit rating, and both asserted that the VA disseminated\n\nfalse   medical   information        which,   in   turn,   adversely      affected\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fCooper's employment.       Both complaints also alleged that the VA\n\nunjustly recouped severance payments under false pretenses and\n\nwithout a hearing.\n\n       Cooper's new claims are merely additional complaints about the\n\nVA's actions following his removal.           Cooper asserts that the VA\n\ndenied him vocational retraining and tampered with his files to\n\ndelay the processing of his retraining benefits. Cooper also seeks\n\nreimbursement of tuition he paid out-of-pocket because of the\n\ndenial of vocational retraining.        The lower court determined that\n\nall of these claims appeared to relate to Cooper's job removal, and\n\nwere factually similar in time, origin and motivation.                  This\n\ndetermination was proper.       Cooper's claim to entitlement to VA\n\nvocational    retraining   benefits,    and    his   allegations   of   file\n\ntampering, would not have arisen had he not been removed from his\n\njob.    Moreover, Cooper's own statements evidence the identity of\n\nhis two causes of action.     In his first suit, Cooper specifically\n\nalleged that the VA committed various acts against him in reprisal\n\nfor his whistleblowing activities.       Thus, Cooper took the position\n\nthat the VA's adverse actions were directly related to each other\n\nin terms of the VA's motivation and common purpose to retaliate\n\nagainst him.    See, e.g., Havercombe v. Department of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199405\"><a href=\"/opinion/199405/havercombe-v-dept-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding that separate causes of action\n\nalleging various improper acts by employer added up to single claim\n\nof workplace harassment).      Although Cooper asserts in his reply\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fbrief that he was not removed from his job, but, rather, did not\n\nreturn to his job because of an ankle injury, this assertion is\n\nbelied by statements in Cooper's initial brief, where he asserted\n\nthat he \"was separated from the military under false pretenses\"\n\nbecause he had \"made protected whistle-blowing disclosures.\"\n\n     In sum, Cooper's claims in both suits seek redress for the\n\nsame wrong: his removal from his job.    There is no reason why the\n\nnew claims in the present suit could not have been raised in the\n\nearlier action.   Cooper was in possession of all the facts on which\n\nhis new claims were based before filing his first action.      See,\n\ne.g., Massachusetts Sch. of Law, 142 F.3d at 38 (noting that\n\nplaintiff \"d[id] not identify any significant facts that were not\n\nwithin its ken before the [first] action reached its climax\" in\n\nupholding res judicata bar to second action).      Accordingly, the\n\nlower court was correct in finding that there was sufficient\n\nidentity between the causes of action asserted in the two suits to\n\nsatisfy the second element of res judicata.\n\n     Lastly, the lower court determined that the parties in both\n\ncases were identical.     The record demonstrates that Cooper named\n\nthe VA as a defendant in both of his lawsuits.       Therefore, the\n\nlower court was correct in finding that this last element of res\n\njudicata was satisfied.    Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of\n\nthe present suit.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f</pre>",
