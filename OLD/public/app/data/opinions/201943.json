Rieckehoff, Assistant United States Attorney, Nelson\nPerez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Senior Appellate\nAttorney, and H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                            December 2, 2005\n\f             Per Curiam.   Frankie Torres-Colon, who pled guilty to\n\ncarjacking and was sentenced to 262 months in prison and five\n\nyears   of   supervised    release,    appeals   his      sentence    on   four\n\ngrounds:     (1) that the district court erred in enhancing his\n\noffense level for physically restraining a person to facilitate\n\ncommission of the offense; (2) that the district court erred in\n\nenhancing his offense level for using a minor to commit the\n\noffense or to assist in avoiding detection or apprehension;\n\n(3)   that   the   district   court    erred   (a)   in    imposing    a   drug\n\ntreatment condition of supervised release in its written judgment\n\nthat was not announced at sentencing and (b) in failing to\n\nspecify the maximum number of drug tests that defendant would be\n\nsubjected to while on supervised release; and (4) that he is\n\nentitled to resentencing under United States v. Booker, 125 S.\n\nCt. 738 (2005).     For the reasons discussed below, we vacate the\n\ndrug treatment condition but find the remaining claims of error\n\nto be without merit and therefore otherwise affirm the district\n\ncourt's judgment.\n\n1.    Enhancement for Physical Restraint\n\n             Torres-Colon first challenges the two-level enhancement\n\nthat the district court predicated on its conclusion that the\n\nvictim had been \"physically restrained\" to facilitate defendants'\n\ncommission of the carjacking offense or their escape.                 See USSG\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f§ 2B3.1(b)(4)(B).1     Because the relevant facts are undisputed,\n\nthis challenge presents an issue of Guideline interpretation,\n\nwhich is reviewed de novo. United States v. DeLuca, 137 F.3d 24,\n\n39 n.17 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n             As Torres-Colon concedes, the examples listed in the\n\nGuideline definition of \"physically restrained,\" USSG § 1B1.1,\n\ncomment. (n.1 (h)) (\"the forcible restraint of the victim such as\n\nby   being     tied,   bound,   or     locked   up\"),     \"are    merely\n\nillustrative . . ., not exhaustive,\" DeLuca, 137 F.3d at 39.          To\n\nconstitute physical restraint, it is sufficient that the victim's\n\nfreedom of movement be physically restricted.           Id.   Under that\n\nstandard, the district court's conclusion that the victim was\n\nphysically restrained from leaving the scene by being stabbed and\n\nbeaten is legally correct and amply supported by the undisputed\n\nfacts.\n\n2.   Enhancement for Using a Minor\n\n             Torres-Colon next challenges the two-level enhancement\n\nthat the district court predicated on its conclusion that the\n\ndefendants had used a minor in the commission of the offense.\n\nSee USSG § 3B1.4.      Specifically, the district court found that\n\n\"the child was part of [defendants'] concealment and was a decoy\n\nin order for them to carry out this offense.\"           If viewed as a\n\n\n      1\n      All citations to the Guidelines herein are to the 2002\nGuidelines Manual, the version that applied at Torres-Colon's\nsentencing. See PSR, ¶ 11.\n\n                                 -3-\n\ffactual finding, that conclusion is a reasonable inference from\n\nthe undisputed facts that the offense occurred in a school\n\nparking lot at dismissal time, where other adults were likely to\n\nbe   accompanied     by   children.         From   those     facts,   it   could\n\nreasonably be inferred, as the government argued, that the\n\ndefendants used the child to fit in better with the other adults\n\nand thereby allay suspicions as to their nefarious intentions.\n\nAs a legal matter, we agree with the other circuits that have\n\nheld that using a child as a decoy is sufficient to constitute\n\n\"use\" of the child within the meaning of section 3B1.4.                       See\n\nUnited States v. Alarcon, 261 F.3d 416, 422-23 (5th Cir. 2001);\n\nUnited States v. Castro-Hernandez, 258 F.3d 1057, 1060-61 (9th\n\nCir. 2001); cf. United States v. Warner, 204 F.3d 799, 800-01\n\n(8th Cir. 2000) (upholding enhancement for use of a child where\n\ndefendant brought his child to a drug deal and offered to leave\n\nher as security while        defendant went to set the drugs).\n\n3.   Drug Testing and Treatment Conditions of Supervised Release\n\n              On appeal, Torres-Colon raises two challenges to the\n\nconditions of supervised release, neither of which was raised\n\nbelow.    First, he argues that the district court violated his\n\nright    to   be   present   at   trial     by   requiring    in   the   written\n\njudgment--without first announcing the requirement at sentencing-\n\n-that    if   Torres-Colon    has    a    positive    drug    test    while    on\n\nsupervised release, \"he shall participate in a substance abuse\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fprogram arranged and approved by the Probation officer . . . .\"\n\nWe agree that by imposing this condition for the first time in\n\nits written judgment, the district court erred. United States v.\n\nMeléndez-Santana, 353 F.3d 93, 100 (1st Cir. 2003), overruled, in\n\npart, on other grounds by United States v. Padilla, 415 F.3d 211,\n\n220 (1st Cir. 2005) (en banc).               Accordingly, we vacate that\n\ncondition.\n\n               Next,   Torres-Colon    argues     that   the district court\n\nviolated      18    U.S.C.   §   3583(d)    and   USSG   §   5D1.3(a)(4)2   by\n\ndelegating to the probation officer the discretion to determine\n\nthe maximum number of drug tests that Torres-Colon must undergo\n\nwhile on supervised release.3          Although the government conceded\n\nerror on this point, its concession rested on our decision in\n\nMeléndez-Santana, which has since been overruled in relevant\n\npart.       See Padilla, 415 F.3d at 215.         Therefore, we do not hold\n\nthe government to that concession but rather consider the issue\n\nourselves.         United States v. Sánchez-Berríos, 424 F.3d 65, 81\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Both of those provisions mandate that a defendant on\nsupervised release be required to submit to one drug test within 15\ndays of release and at least two periodic drug tests thereafter\n\"(as determined by the court).\"\n        3\n      Although this condition was not announced at sentencing,\nTorres-Colon does not challenge it on right-to-be-present grounds\nand concedes that plain-error review applies to his wrongful\ndelegation claim.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f            Despite Padilla, the drug-testing condition remains an\n\nimpermissible delegation of authority to the probation officer.\n\nSee   Padilla,     415    F.3d    at    217-18    (leaving       that     holding   of\n\nMeléndez-Santana         intact).           Nevertheless,        for    the   reasons\n\ndiscussed elsewhere in Padilla, that delegation error neither\n\naffected Torres-Colon's substantial rights nor seriously impugned\n\nthe integrity of the judicial proceedings.                         Id. at 220-24.\n\nTherefore, we decline to correct the error. Sánchez-Berríos, 424\n\nF.3d at 81.\n\n4. Booker Error\n\n            Finally, Torres-Colon argues that he is entitled to\n\nresentencing under Booker.                  Although he concedes that this\n\nargument was not preserved below, he asks the court to revisit\n\nits holding, first set forth in               Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75,\n\nthat to satisfy the third and fourth prongs of the plain error\n\ntest, \"the defendant must point to circumstances creating a\n\nreasonable probability that the district court would impose a\n\ndifferent sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new\n\n'advisory   Guidelines'          Booker      regime.\"       We    have    repeatedly\n\nrejected    that    same    plea       as    beyond   the    power       of   a   post-\n\nAntonakopoulos panel, see United States v. Villafane-Jimenez, 410\n\nF.3d 74, 85 (1st Cir. 2005) (per curiam); United States v.\n\nBailey, 405 F.3d 102, 114 (1st Cir. 2005).                  For the same reason,\n\nwe do so here.\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\f            Torres-Colon virtually concedes that he cannot satisfy\n\nthe Antonakopoulos standard, saying that he \"can do no more than\n\nspeculate about what the district court judge might have done\n\ndifferently under an advisory guidelines regimen.\"             As a fall-\n\nback position, however, he makes a brief, conclusory argument\n\nthat the district court would have sentenced him differently if\n\nthe   Guidelines   were    not   mandatory.        In   support   of   that\n\ncontention, he alludes to \"the severe disadvantage he suffered in\n\nhis upbringing, his mental status after years of substance abuse,\n\nand his socio-economic status,\" which he claims were not raised\n\nor considered by the district court at sentencing.                 In the\n\ndistrict court, however, Torres-Colon told the probation officer\n\nthat he had a \"good\" childhood, was reared by his mother (an\n\nelementary school teacher) and his grandmother in a \"normal\"\n\nsetting, and enjoys good mental and emotional health.              We are\n\ntherefore    reluctant    to   consider   the     proffered    factors   as\n\npotentially mitigating circumstances.             See United States v.\n\nMartins, 413 F.3d 139, 154 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Moreover,    the   district   court    expressly    considered\n\nTorres-Colon's substance abuse and found it to be \"surely no\n\nexcuse for the senseless and cruel emotional harm that has been\n\ncaused to the victim, his family and society as a whole.\"                The\n\ndistrict court further commented that a \"harsh sentence\"--the top\n\nof the applicable Guidelines range--was necessary to protect the\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fpublic and \"meet the sentencing purposes in this particular\n\ncase.\"   Given   those   circumstances   and   comments,   we   see   no\n\nreasonable probability that the district court would have imposed\n\na lesser sentence under post-Booker standards. See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Baskin, 424 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2005); United States\n\nv. Estevez, 419 F.3d 77, 80-82 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          For the above reasons, we vacate the drug treatment\n\ncondition of supervised release and remand the case to the\n\ndistrict court for the sole purpose of deleting that condition\n\nfrom the written judgment.    In all other respects, the district\n\ncourt's judgment and sentence are affirmed.      See Local R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f",

Accordingly, we vacate that\n\ncondition.\n\n               Next,   Torres-Colon    argues     that   the district court\n\nviolated      18    U.S.C.   §   3583(d)    and   USSG   §   5D1.3(a)(4)2   by\n\ndelegating to the probation officer the discretion to determine\n\nthe maximum number of drug tests that Torres-Colon must undergo\n\nwhile on supervised release.3          Although the government conceded\n\nerror on this point, its concession rested on our decision in\n\nMeléndez-Santana, which has since been overruled in relevant\n\npart.       See Padilla, 415 F.3d at 215.         Therefore, we do not hold\n\nthe government to that concession but rather consider the issue\n\nourselves.         United States v. Sánchez-Berríos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201833\"><a href=\"/opinion/201833/united-states-v-sanchez-berrios/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 81\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Both of those provisions mandate that a defendant on\nsupervised release be required to submit to one drug test within 15\ndays of release and at least two periodic drug tests thereafter\n\"(as determined by the court).\"\n        3\n      Although this condition was not announced at sentencing,\nTorres-Colon does not challenge it on right-to-be-present grounds\nand concedes that plain-error review applies to his wrongful\ndelegation claim.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f            Despite Padilla, the drug-testing condition remains an\n\nimpermissible delegation of authority to the probation officer.\n\nSee   Padilla,     415    F.3d    at    217-18    (leaving       that     holding   of\n\nMeléndez-Santana         intact).           Nevertheless,        for    the   reasons\n\ndiscussed elsewhere in Padilla, that delegation error neither\n\naffected Torres-Colon's substantial rights nor seriously impugned\n\nthe integrity of the judicial proceedings.                         Id. at 220-24.\n\nTherefore, we decline to correct the error. Sánchez-Berríos, 424\n\nF.3d at 81.\n\n4. Booker Error\n\n            Finally, Torres-Colon argues that he is entitled to\n\nresentencing under Booker.                  Although he concedes that this\n\nargument was not preserved below, he asks the court to revisit\n\nits holding, first set forth in               Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75,\n\nthat to satisfy the third and fourth prongs of the plain error\n\ntest, \"the defendant must point to circumstances creating a\n\nreasonable probability that the district court would impose a\n\ndifferent sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new\n\n'advisory   Guidelines'          Booker      regime.\"       We    have    repeatedly\n\nrejected    that    same    plea       as    beyond   the    power       of   a   post-\n\nAntonakopoulos panel, see United States v. Villafane-Jimenez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201627\"><a href=\"/opinion/201627/united-states-v-villafane-jimenez/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 85 (1st Cir. 2005) (per curiam); United States v.\n\nBailey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201561\"><a href=\"/opinion/201561/united-states-v-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 114 (1st Cir. 2005).                  For the same reason,\n\nwe do so here.\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\f            Torres-Colon virtually concedes that he cannot satisfy\n\nthe Antonakopoulos standard, saying that he \"can do no more than\n\nspeculate about what the district court judge might have done\n\ndifferently under an advisory guidelines regimen.\"             As a fall-\n\nback position, however, he makes a brief, conclusory argument\n\nthat the district court would have sentenced him differently if\n\nthe   Guidelines   were    not   mandatory.        In   support   of   that\n\ncontention, he alludes to \"the severe disadvantage he suffered in\n\nhis upbringing, his mental status after years of substance abuse,\n\nand his socio-economic status,\" which he claims were not raised\n\nor considered by the district court at sentencing.                 In the\n\ndistrict court, however, Torres-Colon told the probation officer\n\nthat he had a \"good\" childhood, was reared by his mother (an\n\nelementary school teacher) and his grandmother in a \"normal\"\n\nsetting, and enjoys good mental and emotional health.              We are\n\ntherefore    reluctant    to   consider   the     proffered    factors   as\n\npotentially mitigating circumstances.             See United States v.\n\nMartins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201656\"><a href=\"/opinion/201656/united-states-v-martins/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 154 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Moreover,    the   district   court    expressly    considered\n\nTorres-Colon's substance abuse and found it to be \"surely no\n\nexcuse for the senseless and cruel emotional harm that has been\n\ncaused to the victim, his family and society as a whole.\"                The\n\ndistrict court further commented that a \"harsh sentence\"--the top\n\nof the applicable Guidelines range--was necessary to protect the\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fpublic and \"meet the sentencing purposes in this particular\n\ncase.\"   Given   those   circumstances   and   comments,   we   see   no\n\nreasonable probability that the district court would have imposed\n\na lesser sentence under post-Booker standards. See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Baskin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201804\"><a href=\"/opinion/201804/united-states-v-baskin/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2005); United States\n\nv.

In all other respects, the district\n\ncourt's judgment and sentence are affirmed.      See Local R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f</pre>",
