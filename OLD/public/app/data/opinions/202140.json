Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                    Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Raúl S. Mariani-Franco for appellant.\n     Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nH.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-Sosa,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          April 11, 2006\n\f          CYR, Senior Circuit Judge. Jesus Rojas-Tapia appeals the\n\nconviction and sentence resulting from his participation in a\n\nconspiracy to commit airline piracy and his use of a semiautomatic\n\nfirearm, contending that (i) the district court erred in denying\n\nhis motion to suppress the inculpatory post-arrest statements he\n\nmade to the police, and (ii) we must vacate the ensuing Guidelines\n\nsentence and remand for resentencing under the new “advisory”\n\nGuidelines regime prescribed in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S.\n\n220 (2005).    We affirm.\n\n                                      I\n\n                                  BACKGROUND\n\n          On   December     30,   2002,    Rojas-Tapia   and    an   associate\n\nhijacked a rented helicopter and forced the pilot, at gunpoint and\n\non threat of death, to fly them to the state penitentiary in Ponce,\n\nPuerto Rico, where five inmates were waiting on the penitentiary’s\n\nroof, one of whom was the defendant’s brother, Jose.                 After the\n\nhelicopter departed the penitentiary, it dropped all seven men in\n\na rural area, where the defendants went into hiding.             Following a\n\nmassive police hunt, the defendant, his brother, and one of the\n\nprison escapees were arrested on January 2, 2003.              All three were\n\nin possession of firearms.         The police advised defendant of his\n\nMiranda rights, then transported him by police car to police\n\nheadquarters. Several hours into this detention, while police were\n\nasking routine booking questions, Rojas-Tapia abruptly stated that\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fhe wanted to tell them about his participation in the hijacking.\n\nAlthough the police reminded Rojas-Tapia that he had the right to\n\ncounsel and to remain silent, he proceeded to make a detailed\n\ninculpatory statement.\n\n           In due course, defendant and his associates were indicted\n\non one count each of conspiring to commit aircraft piracy, 49\n\nU.S.C. § 46502(a)(1), armed aircraft piracy, id., and use of a\n\nsemiautomatic weapon during or in relation to a crime of violence,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1).       Defendant subsequently submitted a motion\n\nto determine his mental competency to stand trial.              Following a\n\nhearing   and   a   review   of   the    Federal   Detention   Center   (FDC)\n\npsychologist’s evaluation, the district court found the defendant\n\ncompetent to stand trial.\n\n           Defendant also submitted a motion to suppress his post-\n\narrest statement in which he had admitted participation in the\n\nplanning and hijacking of the helicopter.           The motion stated that\n\nthe government could not demonstrate that his waiver of his Miranda\n\nrights had been knowing and voluntary, since the FDC psychologist\n\nconcluded that the defendant had but a borderline intellectual\n\ncapacity, hence could not have understood his legal rights or the\n\nconsequences of their waiver.       At an evidentiary hearing conducted\n\non the suppression motion during the jury trial, Rojas-Tapia,\n\norally and for the first time, raised another ground for the motion\n\nto suppress:        that the police had coerced his statements by\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fdepriving him of food for approximately eight hours following his\n\narrest.   The district court denied the suppression motion, then\n\nadmitted the Rojas-Tapia confession.\n\n          Following a seven-day trial, the jury convicted the\n\ndefendant on all three counts.         The district court thereafter\n\nimposed concurrent 365-month terms of imprisonment under Counts 1\n\nand 2, as well as a term of 84 months on Count 3, to be served\n\nconsecutively to the sentences imposed under Count 1 and Count 2.\n\nDefendant now appeals from his conviction, challenging the denial\n\nof his suppression motion, and from his sentence, arguing that the\n\nintervening Booker decision, which held that the Guidelines are\n\nadvisory rather than mandatory, requires a remand for resentencing.\n\n                                  II\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n\nA.   The Motion to Suppress\n\n          The defendant contends that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to suppress the incriminating statements made to\n\nthe police following his arrest, in that the government failed to\n\nestablish that he knowingly and voluntarily waived his Miranda\n\nrights.    Specifically,   he   asserts    that   the   record   evidence\n\ndemonstrates that he lacked an adequate level of intellectual\n\nfunctioning and comprehension, and that the police coercively\n\nwithheld food from him for up to eight hours following his arrest.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f     1.   The Standard of Review\n\n          We review the denial of a motion to suppress under a\n\nbifurcated standard.   With respect to determinations on matters of\n\nlaw, including whether the totality of the attendant circumstances\n\ndemonstrate   that   the   defendant’s   statement   was   knowing   and\n\nvoluntary, we review de novo, whereas subsidiary findings of fact\n\nare reviewed for clear error.    See United States v. Marenghi, 109\n\nF.3d 28, 31-32 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n     2.   The Alleged Post-Arrest Deprivation of Food\n\n          It is undisputed that the police administered the Miranda\n\nwarnings – including the right to refrain from self-incrimination\n\n– on several occasions following Rojas-Tapia's January 2 arrest,\n\nboth verbally and in writing, and that Rojas-Tapia told police that\n\nhe understood the warnings.    Thus, the sole question on appeal is\n\nwhether Rojas-Tapia waived his Miranda rights.\n\n          A waiver of Miranda rights must be “voluntary” and\n\n“knowing”:\n\n          [T]he relinquishment of the right must have\n          been voluntary in the sense that it was the\n          product of a free and deliberate choice rather\n          than intimidation, coercion, or deception. . .\n          . [T]he waiver [also] must have been made with\n          a full awareness of both the nature of the\n          right being abandoned and the consequences of\n          the decision to abandon it.       Only if the\n          “totality of the circumstances surrounding the\n          interrogation” reveal both an uncoerced choice\n          and the requisite level of comprehension may a\n          court properly conclude that the Miranda\n          rights have been waived.\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fMoran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 421 (1986) (citation omitted); see\n\nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966).   After assessing the\n\ntotality of the circumstances attending a defendant’s confession,\n\nsee, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 3501(b),1   we will affirm the denial of a\n\nmotion to suppress provided the government proved, by a mere\n\npreponderance of the evidence, that there was a valid waiver.   See\n\nColorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 168 (1986); Lego v. Twomey, 404\n\nU.S. 477, 489 (1972).\n\n          First, Rojas-Tapia contends that the government failed to\n\n\n     1\n      Section 3501(b) provides a nonexclusive list of relevant\ncircumstances:\n\n          The trial judge in determining the issue of\n          voluntariness shall take into consideration\n          all the circumstances surrounding the giving\n          of the confession, including (1) the time\n          elapsing between arrest and arraignment of the\n          defendant making the confession, if it was\n          made after arrest and before arraignment, (2)\n          whether such defendant knew the nature of the\n          offense with which he was charged or of which\n          he was suspected at the time of making the\n          confession, (3) whether or not such defendant\n          was advised or knew that he was not required\n          to make any statement and that any such\n          statement could be used against him, (4)\n          whether or not such defendant had been advised\n          prior to questioning of his right to the\n          assistance of counsel; and (5) whether or not\n          such defendant was without the assistance of\n          counsel when questioned and when giving such\n          confession. The presence or absence of any of\n          the above-mentioned factors to be taken into\n          consideration by the judge need not be\n          conclusive on the issue of voluntariness of\n          the confession.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3501(b).\n\n                               -6-\n\fprove that his confession was “voluntary,” because the record\n\nevidence demonstrates that the police failed to provide him food\n\nfor up to eight hours after his arrest.\n\n          Among the totality of factors which may be material in\n\ndetermining the voluntariness of a confession is whether law\n\nenforcement officials   subjected defendant to physically coercive\n\npunishment, such as an unreasonable deprivation of food or sleep.\n\nSee Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 220 (1975); United\n\nStates v. Gillaum, 372 F.3d 848, 856-57 (7th Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n543 U.S. 969 (2004); e.g., Sims v. Georgia, 389 U.S. 404, 407\n\n(1967) (finding confession involuntary where, inter alia, defendant\n\nhad been in custody for eight hours without food); Brooks v.\n\nFlorida, 389 U.S. 413, 414-15 (1967) (same, statement obtained\n\nafter suspect was deprived of adequate food and was detained naked\n\nin a small cell); Reck v. Pate, 367 U.S. 433, 441 (1961) (same,\n\nstatement obtained after depriving suspect of adequate food, sleep,\n\nand contact with family); Taylor v. Maddox, 366 F.3d 992, 1015 (9th\n\nCir.) (same, statement by 16-year-old who was interrogated for\n\nthree hours, and was given no food or water), cert. denied, 543\n\nU.S. 1038 (2004). Plainly, one can envision circumstances in which\n\nsuch deprivations of basic physical necessities would undermine a\n\ndefendant's   will   and   ability    to   resist   coercive   police\n\ninterrogation.\n\n          In the instant case, however, we need not determine in\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fwhat particular circumstances a post-arrest deprivation of food\n\nwould contribute to the coercion of a confession, since there is no\n\nclear        error   in   the   district    court’s   determination   that   the\n\ngovernment established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that\n\nRojas-Tapia had been provided with food before his confession. See\n\nMarenghi, 109 F.3d at 31-32. The government adduced the eyewitness\n\ntestimony of Police Agent Richard Rivera Cortes – one of the\n\nofficers who interviewed Rojas-Tapia the day he was arrested – that\n\nRojas-Tapia had received food prior to volunteering his confession:\n\n     Q:         [Y]ou mentioned also food.\n     A:         Yes, sir.\n     Q:         Did you saw (sic) with your own eyes anyone giving\n                food to Mr. Rojas-Tapia?\n     A:         Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I did.\n     Q:         At what time?\n     A:         I believe it was four something, four forty five,\n                something like that.\n     Q          So, the food was given to Mr. Rojas-Tapia exactly\n                before he was interviewed. That is your testimony.\n     A:         Yes, sir.\n\nMoreover, Agent Cortes testified that, far from being overborne or\n\ndistressed by hunger, Rojas-Tapia consumed little of the food made\n\navailable to him.          Cf. United States v. Gamez, 301 F.3d 1138, 1145\n\n(9th Cir. 2002) (noting that defendant “was offered but declined a\n\ndrink prior to each interrogation,” and “never asked for food”).2\n\n\n        2\n            Rivera Cortes repeatedly stated that Rojas-Tapia received\nfood:\n\n     A:         I believe, we approximately arrived about three or\n                four [p.m.], and we were waiting for the arrested\n                individuals who had been arrested at that time to\n                be supplied with medical attention and food.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fRivera Cortes’ unequivocal testimony was more than sufficient to\n\nsatisfy the government’s burden of proof.               See United States v.\n\nMarshall, 348 F.3d 281, 284 (1st Cir. 2003) (observing that we\n\nnormally defer to the district court’s resolution of witness\n\ncredibility    issues   arising    in    connection      with   a   motion   to\n\nsuppress).    As   Rojas-Tapia   did    not   testify    in   support   of   the\n\nsuppression motion, the record contains no direct evidence to\n\ncontradict Rivera Cortes’ testimony that Rojas-Tapia was provided\n\nwith food.3\n\n          Rojas-Tapia cites other evidentiary snippets, none of\n\n\n\n     . . . .\n     A:   [W]e had to wait for them to get their food and\n          medical   attention,   sir   [before   interviewing\n          defendants].\n     . . . .\n     Q:   Okay, so the first time you saw Mr. Rojas-Tapia was\n          after four P.M.?\n     A:   Yes, sir.\n     Q:   Which was more or less the same time you saw him\n          eating?\n     A:   More or less, sir.\n     . . . .\n     Q:   You didn’t start your interview until he had\n          finished eating?\n     A:   That is correct sir and if I am not mistaken sir, I\n          don’t think he really didn’t want to eat that day.\n     Q:   He didn’t eat?\n     A:   If he nibbled the food, because I remember even his\n          brother, Rojas-Tapia, couldn’t eat.\n     3\n      The government bore the burden of proof on the motion to\nsuppress, Connelly, 479 U.S. at 168, and Rojas-Tapia had every\nright to refrain from testifying, thereby putting the government to\nits proof. We note Rojas-Tapia’s failure to testify only to the\nextent that his decision not to testify left the government’s\nevidence – viz., Rivera Cortes’ testimony – uncontradicted.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fwhich       conclusively    undermines     Rivera   Cortes’   unequivocal\n\ntestimony.4      For example, Police Agent Javier Requena Mercado\n\ntestified that he could not remember whether or not he saw Rojas\n\nreceive water.       However, a witness’s lack of memory normally\n\ngenerates simply a credibility issue for the factfinder, rather\n\nthan a negative inference (viz., that Rojas-Tapia received no food)\n\nas a matter of law.        See, e.g., Bushkin Assocs., Inc. v. Raytheon\n\nCo., 815 F.2d 142, 149 (1st Cir. 1987).         Further, Requena Mercado\n\nwas never asked whether Rojas-Tapia received food.\n\n              FBI Task Force Agent Luis Sosa, who participated in the\n\nquestioning during which Rojas-Tapia confessed, testified that he\n\nhad not seen Rojas-Tapia eating:\n\n     Q:   Can you tell me if you, at any time saw Mr. Jesus\n          Rojas-Tapia eating any food in that afternoon,\n          during that afternoon?\n     A:   No, I was guarding his brother. He indeed was\n          eating.\n     Q:   So, you saw Jose Rojas, Gordy, eating, but you\n          didn’t see Mr. Jesus Rojas eating any food?\n     A:   Yes.\n     . . . .\n     Q:   Do you remember more or less at what time did you\n          arrive at the interview room to interview Mr. Jesus\n\n\n        4\n      Notably, Rojas-Tapia did not include this “deprivation”\nargument in his original written motion to suppress, but raised it\norally after hearing the testimony presented at the suppression\nhearing. It is arguable that this constituted a waiver, given that\nRojas-Tapia presumably knew at the time he filed his written motion\nwhether he had been deprived of food, and his argument did not\ndepend on the police agents’ testimony on this matter. See United\nStates v. Santos Batista, 239 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 2001) (noting\nthat defendant normally cannot delay filing a motion to suppress\nunless supportive evidence was a “surprise”).      As the district\ncourt decided the issue, however, we address it.\n\n                                    -10-\n\f            Rojas-Tapia?\n     A:     The exact, not the exact hour, it was in the\n            afternoon, because we had to wait for them to eat.\n     Q:     But the fact is that when you go (sic) to the\n            interview room, you didn’t see Mr. Rojas-Tapia eat,\n            nor you (sic) saw left overs (sic) there in the\n            room?\n     A:     No.\n\nThe Sosa testimony cannot conclusively establish that Rojas-Tapia\n\nreceived no food, however, given that (i) Sosa conceded that he was\n\nnot in constant surveillance of the defendant because he was\n\ncharged with guarding his brother Jose, and (ii) Sosa might have\n\narrived at the interview room only after Rojas-Tapia had finished\n\nhis meal.    The lack of leftovers could suggest either that Rojas-\n\nTapia consumed the entire meal, or that any leftovers had been\n\nremoved from the room before Sosa’s arrival.\n\n            Police Agent Borrero Torres was asked:     “[D]uring all\n\nthat time [before noon to 5-6 p.m.] you didn’t saw (sic) Mr. Rojas-\n\nTapia eat any food?” Torres replied:     “Food, during the time that\n\nI was there, no, water.”        The Borrero Torres testimony did not\n\ncontradict Rivera Cortes’ testimony that he saw Rojas-Tapia eating,\n\nhowever, since the record does not establish that Agent Borrero\n\nTorres was constantly in attendance with Rojas-Tapia during the\n\nrelevant time interval, and it is unlikely that he would have\n\nguarded Rojas-Tapia for five or six hours with no break.    Finally,\n\nBorrero Torres was asked whether \"any of the detainees received any\n\nfood or water?”   He replied:    “Yes, water, they were given water.”\n\nAs the question was phrased in the disjunctive, however, Borrero\n\n                                  -11-\n\fTorres’ answer would have been entirely accurate whether or not\n\nRojas-Tapia had received food as well.\n\n           Since the government adduced uncontradicted evidence that\n\nRojas-Tapia received food before his confession, the district\n\ncourt’s   factual     determination     that       no    actionable     deprivation\n\noccurred cannot have been clearly erroneous.                        Therefore, this\n\nfactor need be considered no further in assessing the totality of\n\ncircumstances attending the Rojas-Tapia confession.                     See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Spruill, 296 F.3d 580, 589 (7th Cir. 2002) (“There\n\nis no evidence that [defendant] complained during the day about\n\nfeeling   ill   or    hungry     and   he     was       given   food    on    several\n\noccasions.”).\n\n     3.    Borderline Intellectual Functionality\n\n           As concerns the question whether the waiver of Rojas-\n\nTapia's Miranda rights was “knowing,” he primarily cites to the FTC\n\nmental evaluation, which states that he had a “[p]oor range of\n\nintellectual    functioning,      rating      in    the      3rd,    2nd,    and   5th\n\npercentile in intellectual functioning tests performed on him,” and\n\ncharacterizes        Rojas-Tapia's       intellectual           functioning         as\n\n“[b]orderline,”      viz.,     quantified      as       an   I.Q.    (“intelligence\n\nquotient”) of 71.       The report further notes that Rojas-Tapia’s\n\n“understanding of the legal process should not be assumed,” then\n\nrecommends that Rojas-Tapia be permitted “regularly” to consult\n\nwith his attorney at trial, and be required “to restate information\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fin his own words to ensure an adequate level of understanding.”\n\n          The waiver inquiry ultimately turns not upon any one\n\nfactor, but upon all the attendant circumstances, see Arizona v.\n\nFulminante,    499   U.S.    279,   285    (1991),    including   “both   the\n\ncharacteristics      of   the   accused      and     the   details   of   the\n\ninterrogation,” Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 226; see United States v.\n\nFaulkingham, 295 F.3d 85, 90 (1st Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 542\n\nU.S. 953 (2004).     More particularly, the fact that Rojas-Tapia has\n\na relatively low I.Q., standing alone, is not dispositive of the\n\nwaiver determination.       A defendant's mental state or condition, by\n\nitself and apart from its relationship to official coercion, is\n\nnever dispositive of the inquiry into constitutional voluntariness.\n\nSee Connelly, 479 U.S. at 164; United States v. Palmer, 203 F.3d\n\n55, 61-62 (1st Cir. 2000).          Rather, “[t]he voluntariness of a\n\nwaiver of this privilege has always depended on the absence of\n\npolice overreaching, not on ‘free choice’ in any broader sense of\n\nthe word.”    Connelly, 479 U.S. at 170.\n\n          For several reasons, the evidence Rojas-Tapia cites from\n\nthe FTC evaluation is insufficient to render his statements either\n\nunknowing or involuntary.           The FTC evaluation contains other\n\nlanguage which suggests that Rojas-Tapia’s lack of mental acuity is\n\nfar less dire.    For instance, it concludes that he was free of any\n\ndebilitating mental illness, and had sufficient comprehension to\n\nrender him competent to stand trial.         See United States v. Muriel-\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fCruz, 412 F.3d 9, 13 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting that, to be found\n\ncompetent to stand trial, “‘a defendant must be able to understand\n\nthe proceedings against him and have sufficient present ability to\n\nconsult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational\n\nunderstanding.’”) (emphasis deleted; citation omitted).          Further,\n\nthe FTC evaluation concluded that Rojas-Tapias functioned within\n\nnormal range in important areas which implicate the circumstances\n\nof   Rojas-Tapia’s    confession,    such   as    orientation,   language\n\ncomprehension,   naming   ability,    memory,    abstract   reasoning   and\n\njudgment.\n\n            Law enforcement officers credibly testified that the\n\nRojas-Tapia confession was lucid and articulate, see United States\n\nv. Solis, 299 F.3d 420, 439-40 (5th Cir. 2002) (noting that\n\nobservations as to defendant’s demeanor and articulateness during\n\na confession are evidence relevant to whether confession was\n\nknowing and voluntary), and that he volunteered during the routine\n\nbooking interview that he wanted to make the statements, even after\n\nthe officers once again reminded him that he was entitled to remain\n\nsilent and/or request the presence of an attorney, see United\n\nStates v. Duarte, 160 F.3d 80, 81-82 (1st Cir. 1998) (finding no\n\ncoercion where defendant confessed during a routine, low-pressure\n\nbooking interview).    More importantly, Rojas-Tapia cites no other\n\nrecord evidence of police coercive tactics – besides his failed\n\nallegation that he was deprived of food, see supra – which might\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\flead us to infer that the police intentionally preyed upon his\n\nalleged intellectual deficiencies.         See Connelly, 479 U.S. at 170.\n\n            Finally, as the district court aptly noted, Rojas-Tapia\n\nwas hardly a neophyte in the criminal justice system, but had an\n\nextensive    prior   record    (viz.,   Criminal   History   Category   III,\n\nincluding convictions for attempted armed robbery in 1992 and\n\n1994). Thus, the district court reasonably believed that, whatever\n\nthe deficiencies in his intellectual functioning, Rojas-Tapia’s\n\nrepeated earlier exposure to Miranda warnings made it extremely\n\nunlikely that he failed to understand his rights at the time he\n\nmade these incriminating statements.          See Palmer, 203 F.3d at 61\n\n(observing    that   sixteen    prior    arrests   constituted   competent\n\nevidence of adequate comprehension); see also United States v.\n\nGlover, 431 F.3d 744, 748 (11th Cir. 2005); United States v.\n\nPruden, 398 F.3d 241, 246 (3d Cir. 2005); Taylor, 366 F.3d at 1015;\n\nUnited States v. Morris, 247 F.3d 1080, 1090 (10th Cir. 2001);\n\nCorrell v. Thompson, 63 F.3d 1279, 1288 (4th Cir. 1995).           Indeed,\n\nit is in this context that the FTC mental evaluation – that Rojas-\n\nTapia possessed normal capacities for memory and judgment – is the\n\nmost telling.\n\n            Given these factors, we conclude that even assuming the\n\nmedical   evidence    of   Rojas-Tapia’s    intellectual     limitations   –\n\nspecifically, relatively low I.Q. – were to be credited, those\n\nlimitations did not result in a confession which was other than\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f“knowing”   in    the    constitutional      sense.     See,   e.g.,   Clark   v.\n\nMitchell, 425 F.3d 270, 283 (6th Cir. 2005) (“The inquiry is not\n\nwhether   ‘a     criminal   suspect   know[s]     and    understand[s]     every\n\npossible consequence of a waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege.’\n\nThat [defendant] had borderline retardation (in the words of Dr.\n\nKisin) or ‘low average intellect’ (in the words of Dr. Gelbort) is\n\nnot dispositive.        Our sister circuits have found several instances\n\nwhere defendants, despite their mental retardation or low I.Q.'s,\n\nwere   found      to     have   waived    their       rights   knowingly       and\n\nintelligently.”) (citations omitted); United States v. Turner, 157\n\nF.3d 552, 555 (8th Cir. 1998) (holding that defendant's borderline\n\nI.Q. did not prevent a knowing and intelligent waiver); Rice v.\n\nCooper, 148 F.3d 747, 750-51 (7th Cir. 1998) (holding that mildly\n\nretarded defendant gave a valid waiver because police had no reason\n\nto suspect that he did not understand the warnings); Correll, 63\n\nF.3d at 1288 (finding confession by defendant with an I.Q. of 68\n\nknowing and voluntary where he had received Miranda warnings in the\n\npast); Winfrey v. Wyrick, 836 F.2d 406, 411 (8th Cir. 1987) (“The\n\nprimary facts suggesting coercion are [defendant’s] age and low IQ.\n\nYet, in past cases this court considered facts similar to these and\n\nheld that confessions were voluntary.”).\n\n            As neither ground for the Rojas-Tapia suppression motion\n\n\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fhad merit, we affirm the denial of the motion.5\n\nB.   The Booker Sentencing Remand\n\n          Rojas-Tapia contends that we must remand for resentencing\n\nin light of United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), wherein\n\nthe Court held that the Sentencing Guidelines were merely advisory,\n\nrather than mandatory.   Id. at 245-46.    As Rojas-Tapia did not\n\npreserve the Booker error, however, he bears the burden on appeal\n\nto point to circumstances creating a reasonable probability that\n\nthe district court would impose a different sentence more favorable\n\nto the defendant under the new advisory Guidelines’ Booker regime.\n\nSee United States v. Baskin, 424 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005); United\n\nStates v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          Rojas-Tapia bases the remand request on the contention\n\nthat the district court felt compelled to deny him a departure for\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      Although we need not reach the issue, we note that the\ngovernment makes a persuasive argument that the admission of Rojas-\nTapia’s confession, even if it had violated his rights, nonetheless\nwould be considered harmless, given other independent record\nevidence of his complicity in the helicopter hijacking.\n\n                               -17-\n\f“diminished capacity,” see U.S.S.G. § 5K2.13,6 specifically caused\n\nby his borderline intellectual functioning and troubled family\n\nhistory. The record belies his contention.        The district court\n\nstated:\n\n             Although . . . there is some information that\n             would indicate that the court could be lenient\n             with him in view of his background insofar as\n             drug    abuse   and    dysfunctional    family\n             atmosphere, nevertheless the drug abuse is\n             self induced and [he has] his previous\n             contacts with the law . . . . The defendant’s\n             request for a downward departure pursuant to\n             [§ 5K2.13], that is the guideline for\n             diminished capacity, is hereby denied. . . .\n             Based on all the available information,\n             including the forensic evaluation prepared by\n\n\n     6\n         Section 5K2.13 provides:\n\n           A downward departure may be warranted if (1) the\n     defendant committed the offense while suffering from a\n     significantly reduced mental capacity; and (2) the\n     significantly   reduced   mental   capacity   contributed\n     substantially to the commission of the offense.\n     Similarly, if a departure is warranted under this policy\n     statement, the extent of the departure should reflect the\n     extent to which the reduced mental capacity contributed\n     to the commission of the offense.\n           However, the court may not depart below the\n     applicable guideline range if (1) the significantly\n     reduced mental capacity was caused by the voluntary use\n     of drugs or other intoxicants; (2) the facts and\n     circumstances of the defendant's offense indicate a need\n     to protect the public because the offense involved actual\n     violence or a serious threat of violence; (3) the\n     defendant's criminal history indicates a need to\n     incarcerate the defendant to protect the public; or (4)\n     the defendant has been convicted of an offense under\n     chapter 71, 109A, 110, or 117, of title 18, United States\n     Code.\n\nU.S.S.G. 5K2.13.\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f           the United States Bureau of Prisons, all this\n           evidence does not support the defendant’s\n           position.    Furthermore, the subject policy\n           statement of the guideline goes on to prohibit\n           such a departure if the significantly reduced\n           mental capacity was caused by the voluntary\n           use of drugs and other intoxicants, [and] the\n           facts and circumstances of the defendant’s\n           offense indicate a need to protect the public\n           because the offense involved actual violence .\n           . . .\n\nIt is clear from this quotation that the district court agreed with\n\nthe policy statement, and was not of the view that the specific\n\nfacts of this case entitled the defendant to leniency on the basis\n\nof his alleged “diminished capacity.”     We have declined to allow a\n\nBooker remand in comparable cases, where the “diminished capacity”\n\nevidence was available and presented to the district court, “yet\n\n[the district court] demonstrated no inclination to consider [it]\n\ngrounds for departure.” United States v. Mojica-Rivera, 435 F.3d\n\n28, 34 (1st Cir. 2006); see United States v. Morrisette, 429 F.3d\n\n318, 325 (1st Cir. 2005) (“For example, in denying the ‘diminished\n\ncapacity’ departure, the court stated: ‘[T]he psychiatric report .\n\n. . does not establish that [his] significantly reduced mental\n\ncapacity   contributed   substantially   to   the   commission   of   this\n\noffense.”); see also United States v. Martins, 413 F.3d 139, 154\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (“Nearly all the factors to which [defendant]\n\nalludes were limned in the PSI Report, yet the district court chose\n\nnot to speak to them at sentencing.       The inference is that the\n\ncourt was unimpressed.”).\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f          Even assuming, arguendo, that the above-quoted language\n\nwas less than clear, the district court gave no other indication at\n\nsentencing that it considered the Guidelines sentence either unfair\n\nor inappropriate, see Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 81 (stating that\n\nthere is a powerful argument for remand when a district court has\n\nexpressed its belief that a Guidelines sentence is unfair or\n\nunjust), and instead went out of its way to paint Rojas-Tapia in\n\nthe most vivid light as a dangerous recidivist. Since the district\n\ncourt exercised its pre-Booker discretion to sentence Rojas-Tapia\n\nat the top of the applicable guidelines sentencing range (viz.,\n\nelecting to impose 365 months from a range of 292-365 months),\n\nobviously the court was not inclined to be lenient to Rojas-Tapia.\n\nSee United States v. Tavares, 427 F.3d 122, 126 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(noting that sentence above bottom of applicable Guidelines range\n\nis evidence which undermines Booker remand request).   Further, the\n\ncourt emphasized that a lengthy sentence was warranted in the\n\ninterests of protecting society from this defendant, given the\n\negregious circumstances attending his conduct during the helicopter\n\nhighjacking.   See Baskin, 424 F.3d at 4 (noting that district\n\ncourt’s comment that sentence was necessary to protect society may\n\nbe indicative of court’s predilection not to be lenient even under\n\nthe post-Booker sentencing regime).   The district court expressly\n\nnoted several factors which “certainly tilt the scales in the area\n\nof the upper end of the guideline range”: (i) Rojas-Tapia was a\n\n\n                               -20-\n\frecidivist with an extensive criminal history (Category III),\n\nincluding offenses involving violence and firearms, and violations\n\nof probation, which “indicates a need to incarcerate the defendant\n\nto protect the public”; (ii) the scheme to highjack the helicopter\n\nto accomplish the prison escape was fairly complex, elaborate and\n\npremeditated, requiring coordination with the prison inmates; (iii)\n\nRojas-Tapia held the helicopter pilot at gunpoint for hours,\n\nthreatened to shoot and kill him, and repeatedly struck him in the\n\nface;   and    (iv)   the   pilot   was   emotionally   traumatized   by   the\n\nexperience, so much so that, after his release, he telephoned his\n\nwife to ask if his children were alive.\n\n              Given these circumstances, we conclude that there is no\n\n“reasonable probability that the district court would impose a\n\ndifferent sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new\n\nadvisory Guidelines' Booker regime,” see Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d\n\nat 75, and thus affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\f",

After the helicopter departed the penitentiary, it dropped all seven men in a rural area, where the defendants went into hiding. Following a massive police hunt, the defendant, his brother, and one of the prison escapees were arrested on January 2, 2003. All three were in possession of firearms. The police advised defendant of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, then transported him by police car to police headquarters. Several hours into this detention, while police were asking routine booking questions, Rojas-Tapia abruptly stated that he wanted to tell them about his participation in the hijacking. Although the police reminded Rojas-Tapia that he had the right to counsel and to remain silent, he proceeded to make a detailed inculpatory statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, defendant and his associates were indicted on one count each of conspiring to commit aircraft piracy, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46502(a)(1), armed aircraft piracy, <i>id.,</i> and use of a semiautomatic weapon during or in relation to a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1). Defendant subsequently submitted a motion to determine his mental competency to stand trial. Following a hearing and a review of the Federal Detention Center (FDC) psychologist's evaluation, the district court found the defendant competent to stand trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also submitted a motion to suppress his post-arrest statement in which he had admitted participation in the planning and hijacking of the helicopter. The motion stated that the government could not demonstrate that his waiver of his <i>Miranda</i> rights had been knowing and voluntary, since the FDC psychologist concluded that the defendant had but a borderline intellectual capacity, hence could not have understood his legal rights or the consequences of their waiver. At an evidentiary hearing conducted on the suppression motion during the jury trial, Rojas-Tapia, orally and for the first time, raised another ground for the motion to suppress: that the police had coerced his statements by depriving him of food for approximately eight hours following his arrest. The district court denied the suppression motion, then admitted the Rojas-Tapia confession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a seven-day trial, the jury convicted the defendant on all three counts. The district court thereafter imposed concurrent 365-month terms of imprisonment under Counts 1 and 2, as well as a term of 84 months on Count 3, to be served consecutively to the sentences imposed under Count 1 and Count 2. Defendant now appeals from his conviction, challenging the denial of his suppression motion, and from his sentence, arguing that the intervening <i>Booker</i> decision, which held that the Guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory, requires a remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Motion to Suppress</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the incriminating statements made to the police following his arrest, in that the government failed to establish that he knowingly and voluntarily waived his <i>Miranda</i> rights. Specifically, he asserts that the record evidence demonstrates that he lacked an adequate level of intellectual functioning and comprehension, and that the police coercively withheld food from him for up to eight hours following his arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Standard of Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a motion to suppress under a bifurcated standard.

The government adduced the eyewitness testimony of Police Agent Richard Rivera Cortes &#8212; one of the officers who interviewed Rojas-Tapia the day he was arrested &#8212; that Rojas-Tapia had received food prior to volunteering his confession:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: [Y]ou mentioned also food.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Yes, sir.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Did you saw (sic) with your own eyes anyone giving food to Mr. Rojas-Tapia?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Yes, sir.

United States v. Gamez,</i> 301 F.3d 1138, 1145 (9th Cir.2002) (noting that defendant \"was offered but declined a drink prior to each interrogation,\" and \"never asked for food\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Rivera Cortes' unequivocal testimony was more than sufficient to satisfy the government's burden of proof. <i>See United States v. Marshall,</i> 348 F.3d 281, 284 (1st Cir.2003) (observing that we normally defer to the district court's resolution of witness credibility issues arising in connection with a motion to suppress). As Rojas-Tapia did not testify in support of the suppression motion, the record contains no direct evidence to contradict Rivera Cortes' testimony that Rojas-Tapia was provided with food.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rojas-Tapia cites other evidentiary snippets, none of which conclusively undermines Rivera Cortes' unequivocal testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> For example, Police Agent Javier Requena Mercado testified that he could not remember whether or not he saw Rojas receive <i>water.</i> However, a witness's lack of memory normally generates simply a credibility issue for the factfinder, rather than a negative inference (<i>viz.,</i> that Rojas-Tapia received no food) as a matter of law. <i>See, e.g., Bushkin Assocs., Inc. v. Raytheon Co.,</i> 815 F.2d 142, 149 (1st Cir.1987). Further, Requena Mercado was never asked whether Rojas-Tapia received <i>food.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FBI Task Force Agent Luis Sosa, who participated in the questioning during which Rojas-Tapia confessed, testified that he had not seen Rojas-Tapia eating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Can you tell me if you, at any time saw Mr. Jesus Rojas-Tapia eating any food in that afternoon, during that afternoon?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: No, I was guarding his brother.

The lack of leftovers could suggest either that Rojas-Tapia consumed the entire meal, or that any leftovers had been removed from the room before Sosa's arrival.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Police Agent Borrero Torres was asked: \"[D]uring all that time [before noon to 5-6 p.m.] you didn't saw (sic) Mr. Rojas-Tapia eat any food?\" Torres replied: \"Food, during the time that I was there, no, water.\" The Borrero Torres testimony did not contradict Rivera Cortes' testimony that he saw Rojas-Tapia eating, however, since the record does not establish that Agent Borrero Torres was constantly in attendance with Rojas-Tapia during the relevant time interval, and it is unlikely that he would have guarded Rojas-Tapia for five or six hours with no break. Finally, Borrero Torres was asked whether \"any of the detainees received any food or water?\" He replied: \"Yes, water, they were given water.\" As the question was phrased in the disjunctive, however, Borrero Torres' answer would have been entirely accurate whether or not Rojas-Tapia had received food as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the government adduced uncontradicted evidence that Rojas-Tapia received food before his confession, the district court's factual determination that no actionable deprivation occurred cannot have been clearly erroneous. Therefore, this factor need be considered no further in assessing the totality of circumstances attending the Rojas-Tapia confession. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Spruill,</i> 296 F.3d 580, 589 (7th Cir.2002) (\"There is no evidence that [defendant] complained during the day about feeling ill or hungry and he was given food on several occasions.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Borderline Intellectual Functionality</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As concerns the question whether the waiver of Rojas-Tapia's <i>Miranda</i> rights was \"knowing,\" he primarily cites to the FDC mental evaluation, which states that he had a \"[p]oor range of intellectual functioning, rating in the 3rd, 2nd, and 5th percentile in intellectual functioning tests performed on him,\" and characterizes Rojas-Tapia's intellectual functioning as \"[b]orderline,\" <i>viz.,</i> quantified as an I.Q. (\"intelligence quotient\") of 71. The report further notes that Rojas-Tapia's \"understanding of the legal process should not be assumed,\" then recommends that Rojas-Tapia be permitted \"regularly\" to consult with his attorney at trial, and be required \"to restate information in his own words to ensure an adequate level of understanding.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The waiver inquiry ultimately turns not upon any one factor, but upon all the attendant circumstances, <i>see Arizona v. Fulminante,</i> 499 U.S. 279, 285, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991), including \"both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation,\" <i>Schneckloth,</i> 412 U.S. at 226, 93 S.Ct. 2041; <i>see United States v. Faulkingham,</i> 295 F.3d 85, 90 (1st Cir.2002), <i>cert. denied,</i> 542 U.S. 953, 124 S.Ct. 2931, 159 L.Ed.2d 835 (2004). More particularly, the fact that Rojas-Tapia has a relatively low I.Q., standing alone, is not dispositive of the waiver determination. A defendant's mental state or condition, by itself and apart from its relationship to official coercion, is never dispositive of the inquiry into constitutional voluntariness. <i>See Connelly,</i> 479 U.S. at 164, 107 S.Ct. 515; <i>United States v. Palmer,</i> 203 F.3d 55, 61-62 (1st Cir. 2000). Rather, \"[t]he voluntariness of a waiver of this privilege has always depended on the absence of police overreaching, not on `free choice' in any broader sense of the word.\" <i>Connelly,</i> 479 U.S. at 170, 107 S.Ct. 515.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For several reasons, the evidence Rojas-Tapia cites from the FDC evaluation is insufficient to render his statements either unknowing or involuntary. The FDC evaluation contains other language which suggests that Rojas-Tapia's lack of mental acuity is far less dire. For instance, it concludes that he was free of any debilitating mental illness, and had sufficient comprehension to render him competent to stand trial. <i>See United States v. Muriel-Cruz,</i> 412 F.3d 9, 13 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that, to be found competent to stand trial, \"`a defendant must be able to understand the proceedings against him and have sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.'\") (emphasis deleted; citation omitted). Further, the FDC evaluation concluded that Rojas-Tapias functioned within normal range in important areas which implicate the circumstances of Rojas-Tapia's confession, such as orientation, language comprehension, naming ability, <i>memory,</i> abstract reasoning and <i>judgment.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law enforcement officers credibly testified that the Rojas-Tapia confession was lucid and articulate, <i>see United States v. Solis,</i> 299 F.3d 420, 439-40 (5th Cir.2002) (noting that observations as to defendant's demeanor and articulateness during a confession are evidence relevant to whether confession was knowing and voluntary), and that he volunteered during the routine booking interview that he wanted to make the statements, even after the officers once again reminded him that he was entitled to remain silent and/or request the presence of an attorney, <i>see United States v. Duarte,</i> 160 F.3d 80, 81-82 (1st Cir.1998) (finding no coercion where defendant confessed during a routine, low-pressure booking interview). More importantly, Rojas-Tapia cites no other record evidence of police coercive tactics &#8212; besides his failed allegation that he was deprived of food, <i>see supra</i> &#8212; which might lead us to infer that the police intentionally preyed upon his alleged intellectual deficiencies. <i>See Connelly,</i> 479 U.S. at 170, 107 S.Ct. 515.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, as the district court aptly noted, Rojas-Tapia was hardly a neophyte in the criminal justice system, but had an extensive prior record (<i>viz.,</i> Criminal History Category III, including convictions for attempted armed robbery in 1992 and 1994). Thus, the district court reasonably believed that, whatever the deficiencies in his intellectual functioning, Rojas-Tapia's repeated earlier exposure to <i>Miranda</i> warnings made it extremely unlikely that he failed to understand his rights at the time he made these incriminating statements. <i>See Palmer,</i> 203 F.3d at 61 (observing that sixteen prior arrests constituted competent evidence of adequate comprehension); <i>see also United States v. Glover,</i> 431 F.3d 744, 748 (11th Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Pruden,</i> 398 F.3d 241, 246 (3d Cir.2005); <i>Taylor,</i> 366 F.3d at 1015; <i>United States v. Morris,</i> 247 F.3d 1080, 1090 (10th Cir. 2001); <i>Correll v. Thompson,</i> 63 F.3d 1279, 1288 (4th Cir.1995). Indeed, it is in this context that the FDC mental evaluation &#8212; that Rojas-Tapia possessed normal capacities for memory and judgment &#8212; is the most telling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these factors, we conclude that even assuming the medical evidence of Rojas-Tapia's intellectual limitations &#8212; specifically, relatively low I.Q. &#8212; were to be credited, those limitations did not result in a confession which was other than \"knowing\" in the constitutional sense. <i>See, e.g., Clark v. Mitchell,</i> 425 F.3d 270, 283 (6th Cir.2005) (\"The inquiry is not whether `a criminal suspect know[s] and understand[s] every possible consequence of a waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege.' That [defendant] had borderline retardation (in the words of Dr. Kisin) or `low average intellect' (in the words of Dr. Gelbort) is not dispositive. Our sister circuits have found several instances where defendants, despite their mental retardation or low I.Q.'s, were found to have waived their rights knowingly and intelligently.\") (citations omitted); <i>United States v. Turner,</i> 157 F.3d 552, 555 (8th Cir.1998) (holding that defendant's borderline I.Q. did not prevent a knowing and intelligent waiver); <i>Rice v. Cooper,</i> 148 F.3d 747, 750-51 (7th Cir.1998) (holding that mildly retarded defendant gave a valid waiver because police had no reason to suspect that he did not understand the warnings); <i>Correll,</i> 63 F.3d at 1288 (finding confession by defendant with an I.Q. of 68 knowing and voluntary where he had received <i>Miranda</i> warnings in the past); <i>Winfrey v. Wyrick,</i> 836 F.2d 406, 411 (8th Cir.1987) (\"The primary facts suggesting coercion are [defendant's] age and low IQ.

As Rojas-Tapia did not preserve the <i>Booker</i> error, however, he bears the burden on appeal to point to circumstances creating a reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new advisory Guidelines' <i>Booker</i> regime. <i>See United States v. Baskin,</i> 424 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v.

The record belies his contention. The district court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although ... there is some information that would indicate that the court could be lenient with him in view of his background insofar as drug abuse and dysfunctional family atmosphere, nevertheless the drug abuse is self induced and [he has] his previous contacts with the law.... The defendant's request for a downward departure pursuant to [&#167; 5K2.13], that is the guideline for diminished capacity, is hereby denied.... Based on all the available information, including the forensic evaluation prepared by the United States Bureau of Prisons, all this evidence does not support the defendant's position. Furthermore, the subject policy statement of the guideline goes on to prohibit such a departure if the significantly reduced mental capacity was caused by the voluntary use of drugs and other intoxicants, [and] the facts and circumstances of the defendant's offense indicate a need to protect the public because the offense involved actual violence....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear from this quotation that the district court agreed with the policy statement, and was not of the view that the specific facts of this case entitled the defendant to leniency on the basis of his alleged \"diminished capacity.\" We have declined to allow a <i>Booker</i> remand in comparable cases, where the \"diminished capacity\" evidence was available and presented to the district court, \"yet [the district court] demonstrated no inclination to consider [it] grounds for departure.\" <i>United States v. Mojica-Rivera,</i> 435 F.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see United States v. Morrisette,</i> 429 F.3d 318, 325 (1st Cir.2005) (\"For example, in denying the `diminished capacity' departure, the court stated: `[T]he psychiatric report... does not establish that [his] significantly reduced mental capacity contributed substantially to the commission of this offense.\"); <i>see also United States v. Martins,</i> 413 F.3d 139, 154 (1st Cir.2005) (\"Nearly all the factors to which [defendant] alludes were limned in the PSI Report, yet the district court chose not to speak to them at sentencing. The inference is that the court was unimpressed.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that the above-quoted language was less than clear, the district court gave no other indication at sentencing that it considered the Guidelines sentence either unfair or inappropriate, <i>see Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 81 (stating that there is a powerful argument for remand when a district court has expressed its belief that a Guidelines sentence is unfair or unjust), and instead went out of its way to paint Rojas-Tapia in the most vivid light as a dangerous recidivist. Since the district court exercised its pre-<i>Booker</i> discretion to sentence Rojas-Tapia at the <i>top</i> of the applicable guidelines sentencing range (<i>viz.,</i> electing to impose 365 months from a range of 292-365 months), obviously the court was not inclined to be lenient to Rojas-Tapia. <i>See United States v. Tavares,</i> 427 F.3d 122, 126 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that sentence above bottom of applicable Guidelines range is evidence which undermines <i>Booker</i> remand request). Further, the court emphasized that a lengthy sentence was warranted in the interests of protecting society from this defendant, given the egregious circumstances attending his conduct during the helicopter highjacking. <i>See Baskin,</i> 424 F.3d at 4 (noting that district court's comment that sentence was necessary to protect society may be indicative of court's predilection not to be lenient even under the post-<i>Booker</i> sentencing regime). The district court expressly noted several factors which \"certainly tilt the scales in the area of the upper end of the guideline range\": (i) Rojas-Tapia was a recidivist with an extensive criminal history (Category III), including offenses involving violence and firearms, and violations of probation, which \"indicates a need to incarcerate the defendant to protect the public\"; (ii) the scheme to highjack the helicopter to accomplish the prison escape was fairly complex, elaborate and premeditated, requiring coordination with the prison inmates; (iii) Rojas-Tapia held the helicopter pilot at gunpoint for hours, threatened to shoot and kill him, and repeatedly struck him in the face; and (iv) the pilot was emotionally traumatized by the experience, so much so that, after his release, he telephoned his wife to ask if his children were alive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these circumstances, we conclude that there is no \"reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new advisory Guidelines' <i>Booker</i> regime,\" <i>see Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75, and thus affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 3501(b) provides a nonexclusive list of relevant circumstances:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge in determining the issue of voluntariness shall take into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the giving of the confession, including (1) the time elapsing between arrest and arraignment of the defendant making the confession, if it was made after arrest and before arraignment, (2) whether such defendant knew the nature of the offense with which he was charged or of which he was suspected at the time of making the confession, (3) whether or not such defendant was advised or knew that he was not required to make any statement and that any such statement could be used against him, (4) whether or not such defendant had been advised prior to questioning of his right to the assistance of counsel; and (5) whether or not such defendant was without the assistance of counsel when questioned and when giving such confession.

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">* <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 30, 2002, Rojas-Tapia and an associate hijacked a rented helicopter and forced the pilot, at gunpoint and on threat of death, to fly them to the state penitentiary in Ponce, Puerto Rico, where five inmates were waiting on the penitentiary's roof, one of whom was the defendant's brother, Jose. After the helicopter departed the penitentiary, it dropped all seven men in a rural area, where the defendants went into hiding. Following a massive police hunt, the defendant, his brother, and one of the prison escapees were arrested on January 2, 2003. All three were in possession of firearms. The police advised defendant of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, then transported him by police car to police headquarters. Several hours into this detention, while police were asking routine booking questions, Rojas-Tapia abruptly stated that he wanted to tell them about his participation in the hijacking. Although the police reminded Rojas-Tapia that he had the right to counsel and to remain silent, he proceeded to make a detailed inculpatory statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, defendant and his associates were indicted on one count each of conspiring to commit aircraft piracy, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46502(a)(1), armed aircraft piracy, <i>id.,</i> and use of a semiautomatic weapon during or in relation to a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1). Defendant subsequently submitted a motion to determine his mental competency to stand trial. Following a hearing and a review of the Federal Detention Center (FDC) psychologist's evaluation, the district court found the defendant competent to stand trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also submitted a motion to suppress his post-arrest statement in which he had admitted participation in the planning and hijacking of the helicopter. The motion stated that the government could not demonstrate that his waiver of his <i>Miranda</i> rights had been knowing and voluntary, since the FDC psychologist concluded that the defendant had but a borderline intellectual capacity, hence could not have understood his legal rights or the consequences of their waiver. At an evidentiary hearing conducted on the suppression motion during the jury trial, Rojas-Tapia, orally and for the first time, raised another ground for the motion to suppress: that the police had coerced his statements by depriving him of food for approximately eight hours following his arrest. The district court denied the suppression motion, then admitted the Rojas-Tapia confession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a seven-day trial, the jury convicted the defendant on all three counts. The district court thereafter imposed concurrent 365-month terms of imprisonment under Counts 1 and 2, as well as a term of 84 months on Count 3, to be served consecutively to the sentences imposed under Count 1 and Count 2. Defendant now appeals from his conviction, challenging the denial of his suppression motion, and from his sentence, arguing that the intervening <i>Booker</i> decision, which held that the Guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory, requires a remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Motion to Suppress</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the incriminating statements made to the police following his arrest, in that the government failed to establish that he knowingly and voluntarily waived his <i>Miranda</i> rights. Specifically, he asserts that the record evidence demonstrates that he lacked an adequate level of intellectual functioning and comprehension, and that the police coercively withheld food from him for up to eight hours following his arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Standard of Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a motion to suppress under a bifurcated standard.

Thus, the sole question on appeal is whether Rojas-Tapia waived his <i>Miranda</i> rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A waiver of <i>Miranda</i> rights must be \"voluntary\" and \"knowing\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he relinquishment of the right must have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception....

The government adduced the eyewitness testimony of Police Agent Richard Rivera Cortes &#8212; one of the officers who interviewed Rojas-Tapia the day he was arrested &#8212; that Rojas-Tapia had received food prior to volunteering his confession:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: [Y]ou mentioned also food.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Yes, sir.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Did you saw (sic) with your own eyes anyone giving food to Mr. Rojas-Tapia?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Yes, sir.

The lack of leftovers could suggest either that Rojas-Tapia consumed the entire meal, or that any leftovers had been removed from the room before Sosa's arrival.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Police Agent Borrero Torres was asked: \"[D]uring all that time [before noon to 5-6 p.m.] you didn't saw (sic) Mr. Rojas-Tapia eat any food?\" Torres replied: \"Food, during the time that I was there, no, water.\" The Borrero Torres testimony did not contradict Rivera Cortes' testimony that he saw Rojas-Tapia eating, however, since the record does not establish that Agent Borrero Torres was constantly in attendance with Rojas-Tapia during the relevant time interval, and it is unlikely that he would have guarded Rojas-Tapia for five or six hours with no break. Finally, Borrero Torres was asked whether \"any of the detainees received any food or water?\" He replied: \"Yes, water, they were given water.\" As the question was phrased in the disjunctive, however, Borrero Torres' answer would have been entirely accurate whether or not Rojas-Tapia had received food as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the government adduced uncontradicted evidence that Rojas-Tapia received food before his confession, the district court's factual determination that no actionable deprivation occurred cannot have been clearly erroneous.

The FDC evaluation contains other language which suggests that Rojas-Tapia's lack of mental acuity is far less dire. For instance, it concludes that he was free of any debilitating mental illness, and had sufficient comprehension to render him competent to stand trial. <i>See United States v.

Further, the FDC evaluation concluded that Rojas-Tapias functioned within normal range in important areas which implicate the circumstances of Rojas-Tapia's confession, such as orientation, language comprehension, naming ability, <i>memory,</i> abstract reasoning and <i>judgment.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law enforcement officers credibly testified that the Rojas-Tapia confession was lucid and articulate, <i>see United States v.

More importantly, Rojas-Tapia cites no other record evidence of police coercive tactics &#8212; besides his failed allegation that he was deprived of food, <i>see supra</i> &#8212; which might lead us to infer that the police intentionally preyed upon his alleged intellectual deficiencies. <i>See Connelly,</i> 479 U.S. at 170, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111779\"><a href=\"/opinion/111779/colorado-v-connelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, the district court reasonably believed that, whatever the deficiencies in his intellectual functioning, Rojas-Tapia's repeated earlier exposure to <i>Miranda</i> warnings made it extremely unlikely that he failed to understand his rights at the time he made these incriminating statements. <i>See Palmer,</i> 203 F.3d at 61 (observing that sixteen prior arrests constituted competent evidence of adequate comprehension); <i>see also United States v.

Mojica-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202010\"><a href=\"/opinion/202010/united-states-v-mojica-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see United States v.

Martins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201656\"><a href=\"/opinion/201656/united-states-v-martins/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 154 (1st Cir.2005) (\"Nearly all the factors to which [defendant] alludes were limned in the PSI Report, yet the district court chose not to speak to them at sentencing. The inference is that the court was unimpressed.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that the above-quoted language was less than clear, the district court gave no other indication at sentencing that it considered the Guidelines sentence either unfair or inappropriate, <i>see Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 81 (stating that there is a powerful argument for remand when a district court has expressed its belief that a Guidelines sentence is unfair or unjust), and instead went out of its way to paint Rojas-Tapia in the most vivid light as a dangerous recidivist. Since the district court exercised its pre-<i>Booker</i> discretion to sentence Rojas-Tapia at the <i>top</i> of the applicable guidelines sentencing range (<i>viz.,</i> electing to impose 365 months from a range of 292-365 months), obviously the court was not inclined to be lenient to Rojas-Tapia. <i>See United States v. Tavares,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201890\"><a href=\"/opinion/201890/united-states-v-tavares/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></a></span>, 126 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that sentence above bottom of applicable Guidelines range is evidence which undermines <i>Booker</i> remand request). Further, the court emphasized that a lengthy sentence was warranted in the interests of protecting society from this defendant, given the egregious circumstances attending his conduct during the helicopter highjacking. <i>See Baskin,</i> 424 F.3d at 4 (noting that district court's comment that sentence was necessary to protect society may be indicative of court's predilection not to be lenient even under the post-<i>Booker</i> sentencing regime). The district court expressly noted several factors which \"certainly tilt the scales in the area of the upper end of the guideline range\": (i) Rojas-Tapia was a recidivist with an extensive criminal history (Category III), including offenses involving violence and firearms, and violations of probation, which \"indicates a need to incarcerate the defendant to protect the public\"; (ii) the scheme to highjack the helicopter to accomplish the prison escape was fairly complex, elaborate and premeditated, requiring coordination with the prison inmates; (iii) Rojas-Tapia held the helicopter pilot at gunpoint for hours, threatened to shoot and kill him, and repeatedly struck him in the face; and (iv) the pilot was emotionally traumatized by the experience, so much so that, after his release, he telephoned his wife to ask if his children were alive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these circumstances, we conclude that there is no \"reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new advisory Guidelines' <i>Booker</i> regime,\" <i>see Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75, and thus affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 3501(b) provides a nonexclusive list of relevant circumstances:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge in determining the issue of voluntariness shall take into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the giving of the confession, including (1) the time elapsing between arrest and arraignment of the defendant making the confession, if it was made after arrest and before arraignment, (2) whether such defendant knew the nature of the offense with which he was charged or of which he was suspected at the time of making the confession, (3) whether or not such defendant was advised or knew that he was not required to make any statement and that any such statement could be used against him, (4) whether or not such defendant had been advised prior to questioning of his right to the assistance of counsel; and (5) whether or not such defendant was without the assistance of counsel when questioned and when giving such confession.

It is arguable that this constituted a waiver, given that Rojas-Tapia presumably knew at the time he filed his written motion whether he had been deprived of food, and his argument did not depend on the police agents' testimony on this matter<i>See United States v. Santos Batista,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199226\"><a href=\"/opinion/199226/united-states-v-santos-batista/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that defendant normally cannot delay filing a motion to suppress unless supportive evidence was a \"surprise\").
