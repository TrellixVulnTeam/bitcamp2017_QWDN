Plaintiffs Luis R. Soto-Lebrón\n\n(\"Soto\") and his wife, Elizabeth Rosario Domenech (\"Rosario\"), sued\n\nSoto's former employer, Federal Express Corporation (\"FedEx\"),\n\nfollowing Soto's termination by the company for a violation of\n\ncompany rules.1            The plaintiffs asserted emotional damages arising\n\nfrom       libel,    slander,       and    intentional     infliction      of   emotional\n\ndistress       (\"IIED\").2           Soto   also   claimed    statutory      damages   for\n\nwrongful termination pursuant to P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29 §§ 185a-\n\n185m (\"Act 80\").              The jury returned a verdict in favor of the\n\nplaintiffs on all claims and awarded a total of $7,014,910.74 in\n\ndamages.        The district court then granted FedEx's motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law on the slander claim and ordered a\n\nremittitur on the IIED and libel awards, reducing the total award\n\nto $4,014,910.74. FedEx appeals the sufficiency of the evidence to\n\nsupport the liability findings and the damage awards, except on the\n\nAct 80 claim.             Soto cross-appeals the judgment as a matter of law\n\non his slander claim.\n\n               As    we     shall    explain      more    fully   below,   FedEx    badly\n\nmishandled          the    termination      of    Soto.     It    conducted     a   sloppy\n\ninvestigation of his alleged misconduct before firing him.                          There\n\nare grounds for the indignation that the jury apparently felt about\n\n\n       1\n      The complaint also named the conjugal partnership comprised\nof Soto and Rosario as a co-plaintiff.\n       2\n      Because Rosario's claim is derivative, we refer to Soto, at\ntimes, as if he were the sole plaintiff.\n\n                                              -2-\n\fthe performance of the company. Nevertheless, any such indignation\n\ncannot overwhelm the legal rules that courts must apply to the\n\nclaims of liability and the award of damages in a case such as\n\nthis.     Therefore, after a careful review of the record, we have\n\nconcluded that Soto did not introduce sufficient evidence to\n\nestablish FedEx's liability for slander and IIED, and hence we must\n\nvacate those jury verdicts.            There was sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport    liability   for    libel,   and     hence   we    affirm    the   jury's\n\nliability finding on that claim.            However, we have concluded that\n\nthe admission of irrelevant evidence tainted the jury's damage\n\ncalculation    and   that    taint   was     not   cured    by   the   remittitur.\n\nAccordingly, we remand for a new trial on damages on the libel\n\nclaim.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            Given the challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence,\n\nwe recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury\n\nverdict.    Davignon v. Hodgson, 524 F.3d 91, 96 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            On May 30, 2002, Soto, a fourteen-year employee of FedEx,\n\nshipped a package through FedEx to Kissimmee, Florida.                        Soto's\n\nwife, Rosario, a schoolteacher, had given it to him after packaging\n\nit in her classroom with fellow teacher Loyda Romero.                        Rosario\n\nasked Soto to send the box, which contained hair care products, to\n\nIris Romero, Loyda's sister, in Florida. Soto shipped it using the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fFedEx employee discount policy, which permits employees and members\n\nof their immediate families to send packages at discounted rates.3\n\nA.   The Security Interview\n\n              When Soto arrived at work on June 6, 2002, he was told\n\nthat security wanted to speak to him.        He was taken to a conference\n\nroom where Jose Pérez, a FedEx security specialist, was waiting for\n\nhim.4       Pérez said: \"Sit there.    I am Jose Pérez from security.\"\n\nThroughout the interview Pérez remained seated, \"leaning back on\n\nthe chair.\"      Pérez told Soto that he \"had a problem.\"   Pérez showed\n\nSoto the airwaybill for the package Soto had shipped to Florida and\n\nasked him if he recognized the bill.        Soto said that he \"had filled\n\nit out to send Iris Romero the package, the gift.\"\n\n              Pérez then told Soto that \"there were problems with that\n\npackage, that the package had been seized at the station where the\n\npackage ended up.\"       Soto asked what type of problem the package\n\n\n\n        3\n      Section 7-35 of FedEx's \"People Manual\" states: \"FedEx\nExpress offers FedEx Express employees . . . reduced rates for\npersonal shipping.\"    The \"Employee Eligibility\" portion of the\npolicy states that \"[t]his policy intends to offer discount\nshipping through the FedEx Express system to eligible employees and\nmembers of their immediate families (spouse or dependent children)\nas an employee benefit.\" Soto acknowledged receipt of this policy\nby signing a memorandum, dated August 30, 2001, that warned him\nthat \"[a]ny abuse of this benefit may result in termination.\"\n        4\n      Soto consented to having the security interview tape\nrecorded, but FedEx never produced the tape during discovery,\nreporting it lost.     Accordingly, the court gave the jury a\nspoliation instruction, permitting the jury to draw an adverse\ninference from the disappearance of the tape. The facts recited\nherein represent Soto's description of the security interview.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fhad,   and    Pérez   responded   that    the   package   \"had    controlled\n\nsubstances, drugs\" and that it \"had been retained\" by police. Soto\n\ntold him \"that is impossible.\"           Pérez responded by stating that\n\n\"they had evidence, that they had laboratory reports and police\n\nrecords that there were drugs there.\"           Soto testified that Pérez\n\n\"had some papers on top of the conference room table and during\n\ninterrogation he pull[ed] out a document from the documents he had\n\nthere that he said were evidence of the drugs and he said 'I have\n\na lab test' and throughout the interview would show the document\n\nlike this . . . . [H]e waived [sic] the document to me and put it\n\naway.\"   Pérez continued \"asking [Soto] to tell the truth\" and\n\nrepeating that \"they had evidence.\"\n\n             Pérez said he had been a police officer.         He said that he\n\nhad \"left the police because he was not in agreement with the abuse\n\nof the police and to tell him the truth, that if [Soto] told him\n\nthe truth, he would help [him].\"         Soto testified that Pérez's tone\n\nof voice and demeanor during the interview were \"strong[,] . . .\n\nintimidating, with authority.\"\n\n             After \"25 or 20 minutes\" of interrogation by Pérez, Pedro\n\nContreras,     another   FedEx    security      specialist,     entered   the\n\nconference room and Pérez left.      Soto described Contreras as \"more\n\nat ease, more peaceful than Pérez because Pérez was acting with\n\nauthority.\"      Soto explained that the substance of Contreras's\n\nquestioning was the same as that of Pérez, but that Contreras's\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fapproach was \"quieter\" and \"calmer.\"     Soto continued to deny that\n\ndrugs had been in the package. The questioning by Contreras lasted\n\n\"about 20 minutes.\"\n\n           Then, Pérez and Rolando Medina, the station manager, came\n\ninto the room, and Pérez said, \"This guy has to be suspended\n\nbecause he sent drugs through the system.\"       Medina left the room\n\nand returned with a letter of suspension, which Soto signed.          The\n\nsuspension   letter   indicated   that   an   investigation   would    be\n\nconducted and advised Soto to contact his manager each morning.\n\nThe letter also stated, \"[Y]our [sic] are not to contact any FedEx\n\nlocation or customers without management approval.\"      At the end of\n\nthe interview, Soto also prepared and signed a statement indicating\n\nthat he had shipped the package on behalf of Loyda Romero as a\n\nfavor and that he did not know the contents of the package.\n\n           Following the security interview, Soto told the FedEx\n\nofficials that he had to go back to his delivery truck to retrieve\n\nhis belongings.   Pérez said, \"You can't do that.     Just stop right\n\nthere.\"   Instead, Pérez and Contreras retrieved Soto's belongings.\n\nThen another FedEx employee escorted Soto outside to the security\n\ncheck point where he got into his personal vehicle.       As Soto was\n\nbeing escorted outside, he passed by an area where he would be able\n\nto see clients or customers of FedEx.         He reported seeing one\n\nperson in that area.    Medina told Soto as he was being escorted\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\foutside that he should \"calm down, to be at ease, not do anything\n\ncrazy.\"\n\n            Soto explained that after the interrogation he \"was\n\nnervous, confused.\"       He said: \"I was shaking.     I could not swallow.\n\nI was not well.      I was like crazy.       I was like I was crazy.\"      When\n\nhe left FedEx, he was scared.          He explained, \"I didn't know what I\n\nwas going to do, where I was going to go and then thinking that I\n\nwas going to be arrested because what I was told inside was that\n\nthe package contained drugs.\"          When he arrived home, he told his\n\nwife   he   had    been   suspended.      He   testified   that   \"[s]he   got\n\nhysterical.       She started crying, yelling and I tried to be strong\n\nand to calm her down but I wasn't [able] to do so because we were\n\nboth in the same condition.\"\n\nB.   FedEx Proceeds to Terminate Soto\n\n            Soon after Soto arrived home, he and Rosario called Iris\n\nRomero.     Iris reported that she had received the package without\n\nincident.     Soto and Rosario were relieved, concluding that there\n\nmust have been a misunderstanding or a mistake.            Soto immediately\n\ncalled Security Specialist Pérez to tell him that Iris had received\n\nthe package.      According to Soto's testimony, Pérez told him \"that\n\nthe package was at the Federal Express station.            That there was a\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\ftest made by Becton and Dickinson5 and that there was a police\n\nreport.\"\n\n           Because he perceived that Pérez did not believe him, Soto\n\nthen called Medina, the FedEx station manager, to explain the\n\nsituation.   He gave Medina the telephone number for Iris and asked\n\nhim to call her, but Medina did not call.         Medina repeated what\n\nPérez had said: that a lab test had been conducted by Becton and\n\nDickinson and that there was a police report.          He told Soto that\n\nthe police had the package.\n\n           Soto called in to FedEx every morning, as he had been\n\ninstructed to do in his suspension letter.       Each morning, he asked\n\nto speak to Medina and was instead transferred to Operations\n\nManager Alberto Calero, Soto's immediate supervisor. Each morning,\n\nCalero responded that \"they were dealing with the case.\"             On June\n\n11, Calero prepared and filed a report stating: \"Investigation by\n\nSpecialist Pérez revealed that on 5-30-02, Soto shipped [airwaybill\n\nnumber] for a friend of his wife, in violation of FedEx policy 7-35\n\n[the employee reduced rate policy] as admitted by him during a\n\ntaped recorded interview.       Further investigation by the Orange\n\nCounty   Sheriff   Dept.,   Orlando,   FL   revealed   that   the    package\n\ncontained an undetermined amount of liquid cocaine.                 Soto was\n\nsuspended and consequently terminated for the above violation.\"\n\n\n\n     5\n      The record does not reveal what \"Becton and Dickinson\" is or\nwhy FedEx security personnel used this name for the lab.\n\n                                  -8-\n\f            On June 13, Soto was told to come into the station at\n\nthree in the afternoon.    Soto was brought into a conference room\n\nwhere Calero gave him a termination letter.    Soto testified:\n\n            Calero signs my letter of dismissal, of\n            termination    and   he   hadn't    done   any\n            investigation so I asked him, \"Calero, why did\n            you do this? You didn't do any investigation.\n            Why are you doing this? What did you do with\n            the information I gave Rolando Medina?\n            Calero, why did you do this\" because he had\n            told me that he hadn't done any investigation\n            and if he didn't do any investigation, how can\n            he sign the paper saying that an investigation\n            had been done?\n\nCalero responded that Soto \"was responsible for what [his] family\n\ndid.\"   Soto asked to speak to Pérez.   Medina responded that he was\n\nnot available.     Soto said, \"[W]ell, he is not here because he\n\n[knows] that what he had accused me of was a lie because the\n\npackage had been delivered and nothing had happened.    There hadn't\n\nbeen any arrests.      I had not been interrogated by any police\n\nofficer.\"\n\n            Soto's termination letter, dated June 13, 2002, stated:\n\n\"A thorough investigation of an alleged violation of the Employee\n\nreduced-rate Shipping Policy 7-35 has determined that you allowed\n\nyour employee reduced rate privileges to be utilized to ship a\n\npackage for an ineligible person.        In addition, the shipment\n\nallowed an illegal substance to be transported through the system\n\nin further violation of FedEx policies.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f           Soto's termination letter informed him that he could\n\ninvoke review procedures under the FedEx \"Guaranteed Fair Treatment\n\nProcedure/EEO Complaint Process\" (\"GFTP\") by submitting a request\n\nfor review.     He did so in a written statement on June 17, asking\n\nthe company to further investigate the allegation that the package\n\ncontained drugs.\n\nC.   FedEx's Investigation into the Contents of the Package\n\n           At the time of the initial security interview, neither\n\nPérez nor Contreras, the two security specialists, had a copy of a\n\npolice report or a lab report identifying the contents of the\n\npackage   as   illegal   drugs.   Pérez   testified   that,   prior   to\n\nquestioning Soto, he had been briefed by Contreras, who told him\n\nthat \"the package had been stopped by law enforcement in Orlando\n\nbecause allegedly it had a drug alert and they did some testing and\n\nwhatever.\"     Later the same day, Pérez sent an email to Medina, the\n\nstation manager, stating that the package contained approximately\n\none kilogram of cocaine.    The email also stated that Pérez had made\n\na call to investigate further and learned \"that not only was there\n\na K-9 alert, a field test conducted but, the contents were analyzed\n\nby the FDLE (Florida Dept. of Law Enforcement).\"6     Medina forwarded\n\nthis email to his supervisor, Managing Director Roby Brown, and\n\nMaruchi Torres, the acting manager of human resources.\n\n\n     6\n      It appears that Pérez obtained this information from his\nsupervisor, who had received it from FedEx security personnel in\nFlorida.\n\n                                  -10-\n\f            Some time after the interview, Pérez also telephoned John\n\nMatlock, a FedEx security specialist assigned to Orlando, asking\n\nfor further documentation regarding the incident.                On June 13,\n\nMatlock faxed a copy of the incident report filed by the sheriff's\n\noffice in Orange County, Florida to Pérez.              The incident report,\n\nwhich was admitted at trial to show what FedEx knew – rather than\n\nfor its truth – states that a K-9 alert identified the package as\n\ncontaining narcotics.          The police officer then obtained a search\n\nwarrant and opened the package.           Inside, the officer found a \"30 cc\n\nsyring [sic] bottle\" with a white substance in it.                The officer\n\nstated   that   he   did   a    \"field    persumptive   [sic]   test\"   on   the\n\nsubstance and the \"test resulted positive for the presence of\n\ncocaine.\"\n\n            It is now clear that the package Soto shipped did not\n\nhave cocaine in it.        At trial, the judge admitted a lab report\n\nindicating that the 30 cc bottle taken from Soto's package tested\n\nnegative for cocaine.7           The report, completed by the Florida\n\nDepartment of Law Enforcement (FDLE), is dated June 25, 2002 –\n\ntwelve days after Soto's termination, but while the company's GFTP\n\nreview of that decision was ongoing.\n\n\n     7\n      Both Iris Romero and her daughter testified that the package\nhad been delivered by a FedEx truck on June 4. The package was\nshown to the jury. Iris testified that one of the bottles, the\nhair relaxer, was not in its original package (\"it had been taken\nout and place[d] in a ziplock bag\").        No one from any law\nenforcement agency ever contacted Iris or Soto regarding the\npackage.\n\n                                         -11-\n\f            When the plaintiffs sought to introduce the FDLE lab\n\nreport into evidence during their case in chief, FedEx objected on\n\nthe basis that there was nothing to link the report to Soto's\n\npackage.    The trial judge observed that FedEx had had the lab\n\nreport throughout the lengthy discovery period in the case, and had\n\nfiled numerous motions in limine as to other evidentiary concerns,\n\nbut had never before raised the linkage issue.             As a result, the\n\ntrial judge allowed the plaintiffs time to request a document\n\nlinking the lab report to the police officer's incident report and\n\nthen allowed the plaintiffs to introduce that document, along with\n\nthe lab report, as rebuttal evidence after one of FedEx's witnesses\n\ntestified about the initial K-9 alert and field presumptive test.8\n\n            In sum, the evidence indicates that the package Soto\n\nshipped was stopped by law enforcement personnel after field\n\ntesting indicated the presence of cocaine. A subsequent lab report\n\nrevealed that the package contained no illicit drugs.            There is no\n\nevidence to suggest that FedEx was aware of the existence of this\n\nlab report prior to the commencement of Soto's litigation.               There\n\nis   also   no   evidence   to   suggest   that   anyone    at   FedEx    ever\n\nspecifically asked for or tried to locate the FDLE lab test results\n\nat any time prior to the commencement of litigation.\n\n\n\n\n      8\n      FedEx challenges this evidentiary ruling on several grounds.\nHowever, we perceive no abuse of discretion in the district court's\ndecision.\n\n                                    -12-\n\fD.   The GFTP Review Process\n\n            On June 18, Operations Manager Calero and Station Manager\n\nMedina each wrote memoranda explaining the management rationale for\n\nSoto's termination.     Calero's memorandum stated: \"After reviewing\n\nthe Security Investigation outcome it was determined, that Luis R.\n\nSoto sent a package for a friend of his wife using his FedEx\n\nEmployee    reduced   rate-shipping   discount.   In   addition,   this\n\nviolation of FedEx Policy allowed illegal substances to be shipped\n\nthrough the system.\"      Medina's memorandum stated: \"Luis R. Soto\n\nadmitted in a conversation with me and Security Specialist Jose\n\nPérez, that in fact he shipped a package for a friend of his wife\n\nusing his employee discount and that he was not aware of its\n\ncontents.    The airwaybill utilized had Luis Soto's name as the\n\nshipper.    This violation of the Employee Reduced-Rate Shipping\n\npolicy allowed an illegal substance to be transported through the\n\nFedEx system. Some other factors considered were; that if we allow\n\nthis to happen based on the premises that the contents were not of\n\nthe employees [sic] knowledge we will be establishing a precedent\n\nfor future situations of this magnitude.     The ultimate responsible\n\n[sic] for any shipment sent through the FedEx system is the\n\nshipper.\"\n\n            On June 19, Soto met with Managing Director Brown, who\n\ngave him copies of the incident report prepared by the police in\n\nFlorida and the search warrant for the package.        Acting Managing\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fDirector of Human Resources Torres, Calero, and Medina were also\n\npresent at the meeting.   Two days later, Brown sent Soto a letter\n\nupholding the dismissal: \"A review . . . clearly demonstrates that\n\nyou violated the Employee Reduced Rate Shipping Policy, (P7-35).\n\nIt also should be noted that the violation of this policy allowed\n\nan illegal substance to be transported through the FedEx system,\n\nputting your fellow FedEx employees at risk.\"\n\n          Soto initiated the second step of the GFTP process on\n\nJune 27 with a letter to Julio Colomba, a FedEx Senior Vice\n\nPresident.   He asked, \"Where is the lab report that indicates the\n\npresence of illegal substances?\"      On July 8, John Matlock, the\n\nOrlando security specialist, sent an email to Jesus Rodriguez, a\n\nhuman resources person who was working on the investigation,\n\nsummarizing the evidence he had about Soto's package:\n\n          The local Police Officer tested the contents\n          and it tested positive. The cocaine was then\n          removed from the pkg and then there was an\n          attempt to deliver. There was no one home and\n          the package was left at the door in an attempt\n          to find the recpt. The pkg might have been\n          delivered but it was not delivered with the\n          cocaine in it. As far as the written results\n          request, I sent the Security person9 there the\n          only written report from the police officer.\n\nColomba did not meet with Soto.    Instead, he wrote a letter dated\n\nJuly 12, reaffirming the dismissal and once again stating: \"A\n\nreview of this issue revealed that you shipped a package through\n\n\n     9\n      This appears to be a reference to       Pérez,   the   security\nspecialist who had first interviewed Soto.\n\n                               -14-\n\fthe FedEx system containing an illegal drug (cocaine).\"                   Colomba's\n\nletter was copied to each of the personnel involved in the GFTP\n\nprocess (Brown, Medina, Calero and Rodríguez), as well as Juan\n\nCento (Colomba's boss), Nelly Concepcion (Rodríguez's boss), and\n\nSuzanne Gaal (Concepcion's boss).               Soto testified that when he\n\nreceived this letter, \"having a VP of the company state [that Soto]\n\nhad sent drugs, cocaine,\" he felt as if \"[his] world came to an\n\nend, [and] fell on [him].\"           The GFTP review was finalized with a\n\nletter on August 6, 2002.          This letter did not state the reason for\n\nthe   termination   or    refer     to   illegal    substances     or    any    other\n\nnegative information about Soto.\n\nE.    The Plaintiffs' Emotional Distress\n\n            At   trial,     Soto     testified     that   he   had      experienced\n\n\"[e]motional     damages,    anxiety,\"      sleeping      problems,      and   \"deep\n\nsadness\"    following     the   events      described     above.        He     saw   a\n\npsychiatrist ten times (the maximum his health insurance would\n\nallow) beginning in October 2002, and was prescribed various\n\nmedications for anxiety and panic. He explained that he had sought\n\npsychiatric treatment because he wanted to feel like himself again:\n\n\"I mean that I was a happy man like every Puerto Rican.                   I wanted\n\nto be the heart of the party, to share with my buddies, play\n\nbasketball and everything that Luis Soto entailed.                 I wasn't able\n\nto sleep.   I would wake up every night at midnight.                 I didn't know\n\nwhat time it was but I couldn't sleep.\"              He described himself as\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\f\"anxious    always      without     being   able   to    talk.\"      When   asked\n\nspecifically about damage to his reputation, Soto testified: \"It\n\nwas said that I had sent drugs in a package and to me that was stab\n\nand as of this date, it is still in the record, my record that I\n\ntransported drugs through the system, illegal substances through\n\nthe system.\"\n\n            Rosario explained her own emotional distress as stemming\n\nfrom her guilt in having been the one who gave Soto the package and\n\nfeeling \"impotent to do something to help him.\"                   She visited a\n\npsychiatrist a couple of times and took various antidepressant\n\nmedications because she was \"in extreme anxiety, very nervous\" and\n\n\"had some panic attacks.\"\n\n            The district court also admitted testimony that Soto's\n\nco-workers had heard rumors that he was being accused of shipping\n\ndrugs through the system, and they conveyed those rumors back to\n\nSoto.    Rosario described these rumors as \"devastating\" for their\n\nreputation.      She described her husband as having been \"destroyed\"\n\nby the knowledge that these rumors were circulating at FedEx.\n\n            In response to FedEx's interrogatories during discovery,\n\nSoto    stated   that    he   was   seeking   damages      only   for   emotional\n\ndistress.    He did not claim economic damages or produce documents\n\nthat would have supported a claim for lost wages.                 Soto failed to\n\nsupplement his answers to interrogatories after economic damages\n\nwere discussed at various depositions.                  Accordingly, the court\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fruled that evidence of Soto's economic damages would be excluded\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 37.     However, the court permitted testimony\n\nregarding \"economic facts . . . to lay the groundwork or foundation\n\nfor any emotional damages that this plaintiff may have suffered.\"\n\nAs a result, Soto presented other damage evidence, discussed in\n\nmore detail below, describing how his family struggled financially\n\nas a result of his termination from FedEx and the emotional toll\n\nthose financial struggles took.\n\nF.   The Verdict and Appeal\n\n           In submitting this case to the jury following a ten-day\n\ntrial, the district court used a special verdict form that required\n\nthe jury to make specific findings on the particular elements of\n\neach cause of action and separate damage awards for each claim on\n\nwhich it found liability.       After finding liability as to all\n\nclaims, the jury returned statutory damages of $14,910 for wrongful\n\ndischarge, a $1,000,000 award for slander, a $3,000,000 award for\n\nlibel, a $2,000,000 award for IIED, and a $1,000,000 award for\n\nRosario on her derivative claim.        In response to a motion for\n\nremittitur and judgment as a matter of law, the district court\n\nvacated the slander award, reduced the libel award to $1,800,000,\n\nand reduced the IIED award to $1,200,000.     The district court did\n\nnot reduce Rosario's $1,000,000 award, on the ground that FedEx did\n\nnot argue that it should be remitted.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\f            FedEx      appeals,      challenging          the    sufficiency      of    the\n\nevidence as to liability for IIED and libel, as well as the amount\n\nof the damage award, and asserting several other errors, including\n\nan   evidentiary       error    in    the    admission          of    certain   testimony\n\nregarding Soto's emotional distress damages.                         Soto cross-appeals,\n\nurging us to reinstate the slander award.\n\n                                            II.\n\n            We first consider the backdrop of Puerto Rico's modified\n\nat-will employment law, which plays a critical role in this case,\n\nand then turn to the issues on appeal.                Puerto Rico has altered its\n\nat-will employment regime to provide for a statutory damage award\n\nwhen an employee without a fixed-term contract is terminated\n\nwithout    good   cause.        P.R.    Laws       Ann.   tit.       29,   §§   185a-185m.\n\nReferred    to    as   Act     80,   this    statute      defines       good    cause   for\n\ntermination to include, inter alia, \"[t]he employee's repeated\n\nviolations of the reasonable rules and regulations established for\n\nthe operation of the establishment, provided a written copy thereof\n\nhas been opportunely furnished to the employee.\"                           P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 29, § 185b(c).             Although the statutory language requires\n\nrepeated violations, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has stated, and\n\nthe jury in Soto's case was instructed, that an employer may be\n\njustified in terminating an employee after a single violation of\n\nthe employer's rules if the offense is \"'of such [seriousness or]\n\nnature as to reveal an attitude or a character trait so dangerous\n\n\n                                            -18-\n\fto the peace and good order of the enterprise, that it would be\n\nimprudent to wait for a second offense to separate him from the\n\nenterprise.'\"     Delgado Zayas v. Hosp. Interamericano de Medicina\n\nAvanzada, 137 D.P.R. 643, 1994 P.R.-Eng. 908,890 (P.R. 1994)10\n\n(quoting    Secretario      del   Trabajo     v.   I.T.T.    W.   Hemisphere\n\nDirectories, Inc., 108 D.P.R. 536, 544, 8 P.R. Offic. Trans. 564,\n\n569-70 (P.R. 1979)). The employer bears the burden of showing that\n\nthe termination was for good cause.         29 P.R. Laws. Ann. tit. 29, §\n\n185a.\n\n            The statute provides a formula for calculating what\n\namounts    to   mandatory   \"severance      pay\"   for   employees   who   are\n\nwrongfully terminated. Id. The formula provides that the employee\n\nis entitled to:\n\n            (a) The salary corresponding to two (2)\n            months, as indemnity, if discharged within the\n            first five (5) years of service; the salary\n            corresponding   to   three   (3)   months   if\n            discharged after five (5) years and up to\n            fifteen (15) years of service; the salary\n            corresponding to six (6) months if discharged\n            after (15) years of service.\n            (b) An additional progressive compensation\n            equal to one (1) week for each year of\n            service, if discharged within the first five\n            (5) years of service; to two (2) weeks for\n            each year of service, if discharged after five\n            (5) years and up to fifteen (15) years of\n            service; to three (3) weeks for each year of\n            service if discharged after fifteen (15) years\n            of service.\n\n\n     10\n      The official translations of many of the Puerto Rico cases\ncited herein do not contain internal page numbers. Accordingly, we\ncannot include pin-point citation references for those cases.\n\n                                    -19-\n\fId.    For Soto, this formula produced an award of $14,910.74.\n\n                  Act 80's damage formula provides the exclusive remedy for\n\nwrongful termination of at-will employees in Puerto Rico. Porto v.\n\nBentley P.R., Inc., 132 D.P.R. 331, 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754,807 (P.R.\n\n1992); Arroyo v. Rattan Specialities, Inc., 117 D.P.R. 35, 65, 17\n\nP.R. Offic. Trans. 43 (P.R. 1986); Rivera v. Sec. Nat'l Life Ins.\n\nCo., 106 D.P.R. 517, 527, 6 P.R. Offic. Trans. 727 (P.R. 1977)\n\n(referencing          prior     version    of   the    statute).       A   wrongfully\n\nterminated employee cannot recover emotional distress damages for\n\nthe termination itself.             See Porto, 132 D.P.R. 331 (\"[T]he only\n\nremedy available to an employee for a mere discharge without just\n\ncause is that provided by Act No. 80.\").                      However, \"if other\n\nindependent          tortious    actions    concur     with   the    discharge,      the\n\nemployer may be held liable for said conduct.\"                   Porto, 132 D.P.R.\n\n331.        Thus, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has allowed defamation\n\nclaims       to    proceed    alongside     Act   80   claims,      holding   that    an\n\nemployer's defamatory actions can be considered independent of the\n\ndischarge.          Acevedo Santiago v. W. Digital Caribe, Inc., 140 D.\n\nP.R. 452, 40 P.R. Offic. Trans. ___ (P.R. 1996);11 Porto, 132 D.P.R.\n\n331.\n\n\n\n\n       11\n      This case is not available in English translation in\nWestlaw's database.   We have relied on the slip version of the\nofficial translation.\n\n                                           -20-\n\f             At trial, FedEx contended that it was justified in\n\nterminating Soto on the basis of his single violation of the\n\nemployee shipping policy. It argued that the drug allegations were\n\nnot the cause of the termination; thus, it was not obliged to fully\n\ninvestigate them.         Soto argued that the drug allegations were\n\nclearly part of FedEx's termination decision and, as a result, they\n\nshould have been fully investigated.              The jury evidently agreed,\n\nfinding     the    company    liable   for    wrongful   termination.12        The\n\nresulting $14,910.74 award is the only compensation available to\n\nSoto for his damages arising from the fact of termination.                 FedEx\n\nhas not appealed that award.\n\n             With this discussion as background, we turn to Soto's\n\nallegations that FedEx committed \"independent tortious actions\"\n\nthat    caused    emotional    harm    separate   from   that   caused    by   the\n\ndischarge, namely his claims of slander, IIED, and libel.\n\n                                       III.\n\n             In assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider\n\nwhether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict, a rational jury could find in favor of the party who\n\nprevailed.       Gillespie v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 386 F.3d 21, 25 (1st\n\n\n       12\n      The jury could have found liability for wrongful termination\neither by concluding that the termination was at least partially\nmotivated by the unfounded drug allegations or by concluding that\na single violation of the employee shipping policy would not be\ngood cause for termination unless the package actually contained\ncocaine. Either way, FedEx's inadequate investigation of the drug\nallegations is implicated in the wrongful termination verdict.\n\n                                       -21-\n\fCir. 2004).   Judgment as a matter of law is warranted when \"the\n\npresentation of the party's case reveals 'no legally sufficient\n\nevidentiary basis' for a reasonable jury to find for that party.\"\n\nMag Jewelry Co. v. Cherokee, Inc., 496 F.3d 108, 117 (1st Cir.\n\n2007) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1)).      The district court's\n\ndecision to grant or deny a motion for judgment as a matter of law\n\nis reviewed de novo.   Mag Jewelry Co., 496 F.3d at 117; Gillespie,\n\n386 F.3d at 25.    In this diversity case, Puerto Rico law governs\n\nour sufficiency inquiry.   See Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64,\n\n78 (1938); Correa v. Cruisers, a Div. of KCS Int'l, 298 F.3d 13, 22\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\nA.   Cross-Appeal on Slander Award\n\n           The district court determined that FedEx was entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law as to the slander claim because Soto\n\nhad failed to link rumors regarding the cause of his termination to\n\na FedEx employee acting within the scope of his employment.      We\n\nagree.\n\n           To establish his slander claim, Soto bore the burden of\n\nproving that a FedEx employee, acting within the scope of his\n\nemployment, transmitted a false and defamatory statement to another\n\nperson, and that this transmission was negligent – as opposed to\n\nmerely accidental – and non-privileged.13   Corrada Betances v. Sea-\n\n\n      13\n      Soto presented claims for both slander and libel at trial.\nThe two causes of action differ only in that the slander claim is\nfounded on oral statements, which allegedly accounted for the\n\n                                -22-\n\fLand Serv., Inc., No. Civ. 99-1671 JP, 2000 WL 33687211, at *4-5\n\n(D.P.R. July 25, 2000), aff'd, 248 F.3d 40 (1st Cir. 2001); see\n\nalso Torres Silva v. El Mundo, Inc., 106 D.P.R. 415, 6 P.R. Offic.\n\nTrans. 581, 598 (P.R. 1977).      Circumstantial evidence may be used\n\nto prove that it was the defendant who made a particular –\n\nallegedly defamatory – statement.        See Riisna v. Am. Broad. Cos.,\n\n219 F. Supp. 2d 568, 575 (S.D.N.Y. 2002); Robert D. Sack, Sack on\n\nDefamation § 2.5.1, at *2-85 (Mar. 2007) (\"[I]t has been said that\n\ncircumstantial evidence may be used to establish that the defendant\n\npublished the allegedly defamatory words.          That is not to say,\n\nhowever, that the content of an allegedly defamatory statement can\n\nbe proven purely through hearsay.\").\n\n          Soto     introduced   evidence   that   rumors   regarding   the\n\nreasons for his suspension and dismissal circulated widely among\n\nFedEx employees.    He testified that he did not tell anyone at FedEx\n\nwhat had happened.     Nonetheless, soon after he was suspended, he\n\nreceived inquiries from his coworkers, asking whether it was true\n\nthat he had been suspended because his wife had given him a package\n\ncontaining drugs.\n\n          Soto also introduced testimony that FedEx kept personnel\n\nfiles strictly confidential.     One witness testified that, based on\n\nhis fourteen years with the company, leaked information about an\n\n\n\nwidespread rumors of Soto's involvement with drugs, while the libel\nclaim is founded on written statements.\n\n                                  -23-\n\femployee could only come from management.       However, that same\n\nwitness also testified that no member of management had told him\n\nanything about the reasons for Soto's suspension.\n\n          Soto argues that the evidence that the rumors did not\n\ncome from Soto himself, and that only management would have had\n\naccess to the information, allowed the jury to make a reasonable\n\ninference that FedEx management personnel were the source of the\n\nrumors. However, even if it were logical to infer, as Soto argues,\n\nthat someone in FedEx management must have said something to\n\nsomeone to start the rumors, that inference falls far short of\n\nproving each of the elements of slander.   See Riisna, 219 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 575 (\"There are too many links between any statement by [the\n\ndefendant], if any there were, and whatever came back to plaintiff\n\nor her informants to permit a rational inference that whatever the\n\nplaintiff or her informants heard was what [the defendant] said.\").\n\nSoto's circumstantial evidence that the rumors originated with\n\nmanagement does not establish whether management personnel spoke\n\nnegligently, rather than being accidentally overheard.   Soto also\n\ndid not establish that the statements that sparked the rumors were\n\nfalse.   For example, management could have stated that Soto's\n\npackage was stopped by officials after a K-9 alert for drugs.   That\n\nstatement is true and could not be grounds for a slander claim,\n\nthough it could well have sparked the rumors.\n\n\n\n\n                               -24-\n\f            In sum, the evidence introduced in support of the slander\n\nclaim \"does not rise to more than informal rumors\" circulating\n\namong employees, for which FedEx cannot be held liable.                See\n\nCorrada Betances, 2000 WL 33687211, at *5.         Accordingly, we affirm\n\nthe district court's judgment as a matter of law in favor of FedEx\n\non this claim.\n\nB.    Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n\n            Under Puerto Rico law, the elements of a claim for\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress are: 1) that the\n\ndefendant engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct; 2) that such\n\nconduct was intended to cause the plaintiff severe emotional\n\ndistress, or was done with reckless disregard for the plaintiff's\n\nemotional state; 3) that the plaintiff suffered severe emotional\n\ndistress; and 4) that the severe distress is causally related to\n\nthe extreme and outrageous conduct.

A comment to the Restatement explains that the plaintiff has\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\fa heavy burden in proving that the defendant's conduct has been\n\nsufficiently offensive to permit a finding of liability:\n\n           It has not been enough that the defendant has\n           acted with an intent which is tortious or even\n           criminal, or that he has intended to inflict\n           emotional distress, or even that his conduct\n           has been characterized by \"malice,\" or a\n           degree of aggravation which would entitle the\n           plaintiff to punitive damages for another\n           tort. Liability has been found only where the\n           conduct has been so outrageous in character,\n           and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all\n           possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded\n           as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a\n           civilized community. Generally, the case is\n           one in which the recitation of the facts to an\n           average member of the community would arouse\n           his resentment against the actor, and lead him\n           to exclaim, \"Outrageous!\"\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 46 cmt. d; see also Thorpe v. Mut.\n\nof Omaha Ins. Co., 984 F.2d 541, 545 (1st Cir. 1993) (conduct must\n\nbe   \"extreme    and   outrageous,\"    \"beyond    all    possible   bounds   of\n\ndecency,\" and \"utterly intolerable in a civilized community\").\n\nMoreover, when employers have been accused of outrageous conduct\n\ntoward   their   employees,   courts     have    afforded    employers   \"some\n\nlatitude    in     investigating      possible     employee     misconduct.\"\n\nSantiago-Ramirez, 62 F.3d at 448 (applying Puerto Rico law) (citing\n\nStarr v. Pearle Vision, Inc., 54 F.3d 1548, 1558 (10th Cir. 1995));\n\nCamacho, 2005 WL 2644959, at *7 (applying Puerto Rico law).\n\n           Soto argues that FedEx's treatment of him, \"in its\n\ntotality, was 'extreme and outrageous.'\"                He explains that his\n\n\"ordeal was not an isolated event but a series of inexcusable acts\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\funrelated to the employment action taken against [him].\"             In order\n\nto analyze whether FedEx's conduct exceeded the latitude we afford\n\nemployers in \"investigating possible employee misconduct\" and went\n\n\"beyond all possible bounds of decency,\" we must consider the\n\nparticular actions by FedEx upon which Soto bases his IIED claim:\n\nthe repeated allegations that he had shipped drugs, the security\n\ninterview, and the inadequate investigation.             We address each in\n\nturn.\n\n           1.   Allegations That Soto Shipped Drugs\n\n           It   is   now     clear   that   Soto   was   accused    by   FedEx,\n\nrepeatedly and in writing, of doing something that he did not do:\n\nshipping, or allowing someone else to ship, drugs through the FedEx\n\nsystem.     Those    were     egregiously    false   accusations.         Those\n\naccusations are precisely the basis of his libel claim.                  Such a\n\nclaim cannot be brought in the guise of an IIED claim, which would\n\ndivorce it from the well developed law of defamation with its\n\nattendant privileges and defenses.            See Demas v. Levitsky, 738\n\nN.Y.S.2d 402,    409 (N.Y. App. Div. 2002) (holding that where \"the\n\nconduct   alleged    .   .   .   falls   squarely    within   the   scope    of\n\nplaintiff's defamation claim,\" the plaintiff's IIED claim should\n\nhave been dismissed); Grimes v. Carter, 50 Cal. Rptr. 808, 813\n\n(Cal. Ct. App. 1966) (holding that \"[i]n circumstances where a\n\nplaintiff states a case of libel or slander, [emotional distress]\n\nis a matter which may be taken into account in determining the\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\famount of damages to which the plaintiff is entitled, but it does\n\nnot give rise to an independent cause of action on the theory of a\n\nseparate tort.\").\n\n           Moreover,     the    jury        here   was     instructed,     without\n\nobjection, that \"[t]he publication of a defamatory statement does\n\nnot   constitute   extreme     and    outrageous         conduct.\"      This    jury\n\ninstruction thus became the law of the case and establishes the\n\nstandard by which we review the sufficiency of the evidence on\n\nappeal.   Rodriguez-Torres v. Caribbean Forms Manufacturer, Inc.,\n\n399 F.3d 52, 58 (1st Cir. 2005); see also Scott-Harris v. City of\n\nFall River, 134 F.3d 427, 442 & n.16 (1st Cir. 1997), rev'd on\n\nother grounds, 523 U.S. 44 (1998).            Soto seeks to avoid the impact\n\nof this jury instruction by asserting that it is the repetition of\n\nthe   defamatory   statements        that    amounts     to    the   \"extreme   and\n\noutrageous    conduct\"   here.         However,     the       repetition   of   the\n\nstatements is properly analyzed in the context of an abuse of an\n\nemployer's conditional privilege to speak about an employee.                    See\n\nPorto, 132 D.P.R. 331 (describing the elements of conditional\n\nprivilege).   Accordingly, to the extent that Soto's IIED claim is\n\npredicated on defamatory statements, the conduct must be considered\n\nunder the framework of Soto's libel claim, which we address below,\n\n\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\fand cannot, as a matter of law, satisfy the \"extreme and outrageous\n\nconduct\" requirement of the IIED claim.14\n\n             2.   The Security Interview\n\n             Soto also points to the security interview as \"extreme\n\nand outrageous\" conduct by FedEx.         As we noted above, courts have\n\nafforded     employers   \"some   latitude      in    investigating   possible\n\nemployee misconduct.\"      Santiago-Ramirez, 62 F.3d at 448 (citing\n\nStarr v. Pearle Vision, Inc., 54 F.3d 1548, 1558 (10th Cir.\n\n1995))(applying Puerto Rico law); Camacho, 2005 WL 2644959 at *7\n\n(applying Puerto Rico law).\n\n             In    Santiago-Ramirez,      we        addressed   circumstances\n\nremarkably similar to the security interview conducted in Soto's\n\ncase:\n\n             Appellant, Santiago, worked as a cashier at\n             Fort Buchanan's Army Post Exchange Store. The\n             store's policy prohibited employees from\n             carrying merchandise through the front door.\n             On June 29, 1990, Santiago and a co-employee\n             violated this policy when they removed bags\n             containing store merchandise through the front\n             entrance. They placed these bags in the trunk\n             of the co-employee's car.      Unbeknownst to\n             Santiago,    the   bags    contained    stolen\n             merchandise. The Safety and Security Manager\n             and Santiago's supervisor questioned her for a\n             total of 45 minutes concerning this breach of\n             store policy. Santiago told them that she did\n\n\n        14\n      Soto's brief states that \"the IIED claim revolves around\nfacts that are separate and distinct from the defamation claim and\ninvolve different injuries.\" Although other portions of the brief\nappear to marshal the defamatory conduct in support of his IIED\nclaim, this statement appears to be an acknowledgment that FedEx's\ndefamatory actions cannot form the basis of Soto's IIED claim.\n\n                                   -29-\n\f          not know that the merchandise was stolen but\n          was aware of the store's regulation that\n          prohibited employees from carrying merchandise\n          through the front door.        She was later\n          terminated for violating this regulation.\n\n62 F.3d at 446. During the security interview, Santiago \"was shown\n\na videotape supposedly taken at the store where she worked\" and\n\n\"told that if she did not cooperate with the investigation 'all of\n\nthis could be taken to the F.B.I.'\"       Id. at 448.       We held that\n\n\"[b]ecause this questioning was a necessary incident of employment\n\nfor an employee who had broken the rules, under Puerto Rican law it\n\ncannot be said to be intentionally tortious.\"         Id.   In analyzing\n\nSantiago's claim, we drew an analogy to Starr, a Tenth Circuit case\n\nwhich held that \"a plaintiff's allegations that her employer yelled\n\nat her, pushed her back down into her chair, touched her arm and\n\nblocked her exit from the room during questioning, did not rise to\n\nthe level of outrageousness required to state a cause of action for\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress.\"        Santiago-Ramirez,\n\n62 F.3d at 448 (describing the holding in Starr, 54 F.3d at 1558).\n\n          Contrasting the facts in Starr and Santiago-Ramirez with\n\nthose in Kaminski v. United Parcel Service, 501 N.Y.S.2d 871 (N.Y.\n\nApp. Div. 1986), a case cited by the plaintiffs, is instructive in\n\nevaluating   when   an   employer's   interrogation    of   an   employee\n\nsuspected of violating company rules crosses over the line into\n\n\"outrageous and extreme conduct.\"         In Kaminski, UPS security\n\npersonnel accused the plaintiff, a UPS driver, of \"not having\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\freported the receipt of a cash payment for a package.\"                501\n\nN.Y.S.2d at 872.     The plaintiff denied the charge.       The security\n\npersonnel told the plaintiff that he had been identified as the\n\nthief by two eyewitnesses.    \"They then allegedly began to threaten\n\nhim with a criminal prosecution and a prison term at Riker's Island\n\nif plaintiff did not admit stealing the money, agree to return the\n\nmoney, resign, and waive his rights to all health, hospital and\n\npension benefits.\"     Id.    The plaintiff alleged that \"for three\n\nhours he was subjected to these threats which were accompanied by\n\nloud, aggressive, profane and obscene language and gestures.\"         Id.\n\nHe claimed that \"[a]t all times one or another of the defendants\n\nwas blocking the door to the office.\"         Id.   Finally, he claimed\n\nthat after three hours of this ordeal, \"under duress and still\n\ndenying   the   accusation,   [he]   signed   resignation    papers   and\n\ndocuments relinquishing his pension plan and health and hospital\n\nbenefits and statements admitting his guilt.\" Id. On these facts,\n\nthe court permitted the employee's IIED claim to survive a motion\n\nto dismiss.\n\n           Comparing the facts in Soto's case with the facts in\n\nthese three cases leads us to the conclusion that, as a matter of\n\nlaw, the security interview conducted by FedEx does not constitute\n\n\"outrageous and extreme conduct.\"       The interview established that\n\nSoto had used his employee discount to ship a package for his\n\nwife's friend without knowledge of its contents in violation of\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\fFedEx's    policy.        The    questioning   lasted      approximately      40-45\n\nminutes, comparable in length to the questioning in Santiago-\n\nRamirez.     There was no evidence of any physical intimidation,\n\nblocking of the exits, or pushing.             Unlike in Kaminski, Security\n\nSpecialist Pérez did not threaten Soto with a prison sentence,\n\npressure him into resigning and relinquishing his pension plan\n\nbenefits,     or   make    any    other    verbal    threats.      Under   these\n\ncircumstances, it is more accurate to characterize the security\n\ninterview of Soto as a \"necessary incident of employment for an\n\nemployee who had broken the rules.\"            See Santiago-Ramirez, 62 F.3d\n\nat 449.\n\n            The most egregious aspect of the interview was Pérez's\n\nstatement that he had a lab report as he waived a piece of paper in\n\nfront of Soto.     Pérez was, of course, bluffing.            He did not have a\n\ncopy of any document other than the airwaybill at the time of the\n\nsecurity    interview.          However,    Pérez    had   been   told   by    his\n\nsupervisors that the package was intercepted by police in Florida\n\nand had tested positive for cocaine.             Under these circumstances,\n\nhis bluff could not reasonably be considered \"beyond all possible\n\nbounds of decency.\"\n\n            Soto also complains that he was \"summarily suspended and\n\npublicly escorted off FedEx premises.\"              However, these actions are\n\nwell within the latitude we afford employers investigating employee\n\nmisconduct.    The decision to remove him immediately and accompany\n\n\n                                       -32-\n\fhim as he left the company property was a reasonable course of\n\naction in the face of the allegations against him.     Thus, none of\n\nthe conduct during or immediately following the security interview\n\nwas \"extreme and outrageous.\"15     It cannot support the intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress claim.\n\n             3.   The Inadequate Investigation\n\n             Soto points to the inadequacy of the investigation as\n\nanother aspect of FedEx's outrageous conduct: \"FedEx did little or\n\nnothing to obtain the facts, apparently preferring to avoid the\n\ntruth in favor of a lie.\"     The inadequacy of FedEx's investigation\n\nto support the allegation that Soto's package contained drugs is\n\nunmistakable, and that inadequacy remains a troubling aspect of\n\nthis case.    Soto emphasized that inadequacy as a key element of his\n\nargument that FedEx's termination of him was wrongful and, as we\n\ndescribe below, that FedEx had abused its conditional privilege to\n\npublish statements about an employee.        However, the inadequate\n\ninvestigation is not conduct on the part of FedEx that caused harm\n\nto Soto independent of the harms caused by the termination itself\n\nand the publication of the libelous statements.     The harm arising\n\n\n     15\n      Soto also argues that the \"mysterious\" disappearance of the\naudio tape of the security interview should be considered as one\nelement in FedEx's egregious course of conduct. However, Soto was\nunaware that the tape had been lost until FedEx failed to produce\nit during discovery in this case. As such, its disappearance is\nnot relevant conduct for the IIED inquiry.       See Knussman v.\nMaryland, 272 F.3d 625, 641 (4th Cir. 2001) (\"Generally speaking,\nlitigation-induced emotional distress is never a compensable\nelement of damages.\").\n\n                                  -33-\n\ffrom the termination is, as we explained above, compensable only\n\nunder Act 80, and cannot factor into our analysis of IIED.              P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 29, § 185a; Vélez Rodríguez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,\n\n135   D.P.R.    500,   1994     P.R.-Eng.    909576   (P.R.    1994)   (\"The\n\ncompensation provided by law is the exclusive remedy for unjust\n\ndischarge.\").    Similarly, Soto's emotional distress arising from\n\ndefamatory statements published by the company must be analyzed\n\nunder the framework of libel law.\n\n          4.    The Whole Course of Conduct Theory\n\n          Soto    argues      that   the    sum   total   of   the   repeated\n\ndefamation, the failure to investigate, and the security interview\n\n– FedEx's whole course of conduct – amounts to \"extreme and\n\noutrageous conduct,\" even if the individual actions by FedEx, taken\n\nseparately, would not.        We cannot agree, particularly when two of\n\nthe actions cited by Soto – the repeated accusations that he\n\nshipped drugs and the inadequate investigation of that claim –\n\ncannot be considered as conduct relevant to the IIED claim.             Soto\n\nhas not described any conduct, taken together or separately, that\n\ncould properly form the basis of a claim for IIED.\n\n          Because Soto has failed to introduce sufficient evidence\n\nto support a finding of \"extreme and outrageous conduct\" by FedEx,\n\nhis IIED claim necessarily fails.            Accordingly, we reverse the\n\ndistrict court's denial of FedEx's motion for judgment as a matter\n\n\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\fof law and vacate Soto's $1.2 million remitted damage award on that\n\nclaim.\n\nC.   Libel\n\n             FedEx also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to\n\nsupport Soto's libel claim. Under Puerto Rico law, Soto must prove\n\nthat FedEx negligently published false and defamatory written\n\nstatements that caused him actual harm.        He must also demonstrate\n\nthat FedEx abused its conditional privilege to speak about its\n\nemployees.     Porto, 132 D.P.R. 331.\n\n             Soto   asserts   that   FedEx   published   ten   false   and\n\ndefamatory statements stating that he illegally shipped drugs:\n\n     C       \"The aforementioned [airwaybill] contained approximately\n             one kg. of cocaine.\"    Email from Security Specialist\n             Pérez to Station Manager Medina, dated June 6, 2002.\n\n     C       \"[F]urther investigation . . . revealed that the package\n             contained an undetermined amount of liquid cocaine.\"\n             Incident report written by Pérez, dated June 11, 2002.16\n\n     C       \"A thorough investigation . . . has determined that you\n             . . . allowed an illegal substance to be transported\n             through the system in further violation of FedEx\n             policies.\"    Termination letter (copied to Managing\n             Director Brown and Rodríguez, a human resources officer),\n             dated June 13, 2002.\n\n\n\n\n     16\n      FedEx separately challenges whether this statement was ever\npublished to any other person within FedEx. However, Operations\nManager Calero's report dated June 11 explicitly refers to an\ninvestigation by Pérez.      Thus, we conclude that there was\nsufficient evidence to allow the jury to infer that Calero read\nPérez's incident report in preparing his own report.\n\n                                     -35-\n\f     C    \"This violation . . . allowed an illegal substance to be\n          transported through the FedEx system.\" GFTP Memorandum\n          prepared by Medina, dated June 18, 2002.17\n\n     C    \"[T]his violation of FedEx Policy allowed illegal\n          substances to be shipped through the system.\"      GFTP\n          Memorandum prepared by Operations Manager Calero, dated\n          June 18, 2002.\n\n     C    \"A review . . . clearly demonstrates that . . . the\n          violation . . . allowed an illegal substance to be\n          transported through the FedEx system, putting your fellow\n          FedEx employees at risk.\"     Letter from Brown to Soto\n          (copied to Medina, Calero, Acting Human Resources\n          Director Torres, and Rodriguez), dated June 21, 2002.\n\n     C    \"Whether or not Luis Soto was aware of the contents of\n          the package it is clear that by allowing someone other\n          than an immediate relative to utilize his shipping\n          privileges he allowed an illegal substance to be placed\n          in the FedEx system for transportation.\" GFTP Memorandum\n          prepared by Brown, dated July 1, 2002.\n\n     C    \"In summary, Mr. Soto . . . placed himself and the\n          Company in jeopardy by allowing illegal substances to be\n          transported through the FedEx system.\" GFTP Memorandum\n          prepared by Rodriguez, dated July 2, 2002.\n\n     C    \"The local Police Officer tested the contents and it\n          tested positive.

We address each challenge in turn.18\n\n                1.    Falsity\n\n                FedEx insists that Soto failed to establish that the ten\n\nallegedly defamatory statements were false.                 FedEx does not assert\n\nthat the package Soto shipped did, in fact, contain cocaine.\n\nNonetheless, the company argues that even if the FDLE lab results\n\nshow that Soto's package did not contain cocaine, those results do\n\n\"not establish that Bailey, the K-9, did not alert on the package\n\nor that the presumptive field test did not return a positive result\n\nfor cocaine.\"          This argument misses the mark.           The statements at\n\nissue do not assert that the package tested positive for cocaine in\n\nthe field.          Rather, they each conclusively assert that the package\n\nactually contained cocaine. Both the FDLE report and the fact that\n\nno law enforcement officer ever questioned Soto or Iris Romero\n\nabout        this    illegal    shipment   of     drugs   permitted   the   jury   to\n\nreasonably conclude that the statements were false.\n\n\n\n\n        18\n      FedEx also claims that the district court erred in refusing\nto include a separate interrogatory as to each individual\ndefamatory statement on the special verdict form. However, the\ndistrict court did instruct the jury that it must consider each\ncommunication separately in making a determination regarding Soto's\nlibel claim. The special verdict form here was already long and\ndetailed. It was well within the district court's discretion to\ndetermine that the jury instruction was sufficient and that the\nspecial verdict form requested by FedEx was unnecessarily detailed.\nSee Santos v. Posadas De P.R. Assocs., Inc., 452 F.3d 59, 65 (1st\nCir. 2006).\n\n                                           -37-\n\f             2.   Publication\n\n             FedEx   next   argues    that     Soto   failed       to    establish\n\npublication because the statements were published only within FedEx\n\nand   such    intracorporate     communications       do     not    satisfy     the\n\npublication element of the libel claim.          This argument reflects an\n\nincorrect reading of Puerto Rico law.            In Porto, the Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme      Court   expressly    adopted      the    majority          rule   that\n\nintracorporate communication of a defamatory statement satisfies\n\nthe publication requirement.         132 D.P.R. 331 (\"[W]e hold that the\n\nreputation of a person in the workplace may be denigrated through\n\nan intracorporate communication and, if there is evidence of the\n\nsame, the publication requirement is satisfied.\"). FedEx seizes on\n\nisolated language later in the opinion, where the court appears to\n\nconflate the concepts of publication and privilege by noting that\n\n\"[t]he presence of the company personnel manager was completely\n\nlogical and reasonable\" in a meeting where the allegedly defamatory\n\ndischarge letter was discussed.          Id.     However, the Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme   Court's     adoption   of    the   rule     that    the       publication\n\nrequirement is satisfied by intracorporate communications was clear\n\nand unequivocal.       Thus, the question of whether the internal\n\npublication was \"logical and reasonable\" properly belongs in the\n\ndiscussion of conditional privilege, to which we turn next.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -38-\n\f             3.   Abuse of Conditional Privilege\n\n             Under Puerto Rico law, communications among \"managers or\n\nsupervisors of a discharged employee, regarding the reasons for the\n\ndischarge,\" are conditionally privileged.             Porto, 132 D.P.R. 331.\n\nThis privilege applies to \"'all bona fide communications upon any\n\nsubject matter in which the author has an interest or with respect\n\nto which he has a duty to perform to others.'\"                  Id. (quoting\n\nCaraballo v. P.R. Ilustrado, Inc., 70 P.R.R. 265, 272 (1949)). It\n\nis \"'termed conditional because the person availing himself of it\n\nmust use it in a lawful manner and for a proper purpose.'\"                 Id.\n\n(quoting Caraballo, 70 P.R.R. at 272).           Accordingly, the privilege\n\nis    lost   if   the   employer   abuses   it   by   giving   the   statement\n\n\"excessive publicity\" or by publishing it for \"improper reasons.\"19\n\nId.\n\n             Although there are no Puerto Rico cases directly on\n\npoint, case law from other jurisdictions suggests that \"improper\n\nreasons\" are established and the conditional privilege destroyed\n\nwhere an employer is on notice that the defamatory statements are\n\n\n\n       19\n      FedEx asserts on appeal that plaintiffs were required to meet\ntheir burden on this issue with \"clear and convincing evidence.\"\nPuerto Rico has not adopted this standard and the jury was\ninstructed, without objection, that the preponderance of the\nevidence standard applies. As such, the preponderance standard is\nthe law of the case. See Rodriguez-Torres, 399 F.3d at 58. FedEx\nalso challenges the district court's refusal to instruct the jury\nthat \"good faith is presumed.\" However, the court did instruct the\njury that Soto bore the burden of establishing that FedEx abused\nits conditional privilege. No more was required.\n\n                                     -39-\n\fof questionable validity and yet, with reckless disregard for the\n\ntruth, fails to adequately investigate their veracity.           See, e.g.,\n\nA.B.C. Needlecraft Co. v. Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., 245 F.2d 775, 777\n\n(2d Cir. 1957) (holding that evidence was sufficient to warrant\n\nsubmission of the case to the jury as to whether privilege had been\n\nabused    when   defendant's    defamatory   statement   was    based   on    a\n\n\"misunderstood casual remark, with no effort to verify facts,\n\nthough to have done so would have been a simple matter\"); Torosyan\n\nv. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharm., Inc., 662 A.2d 89, 104 (Conn. 1995)\n\n(conditional     privilege     destroyed   where   defendants   \"failed      to\n\ninvestigate or retract the statement even after the plaintiff\n\nnotified them that the statement was false and requested further\n\nreview\"); Wirig v. Kinney Shoe Corp., 461 N.W.2d 374, 380-81 (Minn.\n\n1990) (conditional privilege destroyed where \"an employer . . .\n\ntakes no steps to investigate but relies entirely on accusations\n\neither made by employees who may be biased or on second-hand\n\nhearsay with no identification of sources\"); Restatement (Second)\n\nof Torts § 600 (1977) (conditional privilege fails if statement\n\nmade with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard as to its\n\ntruth).\n\n            In this case, the ten defamatory statements made by FedEx\n\nwere clearly within the scope of the conditional privilege as\n\ncommunications regarding the discharge of an employee.             The jury\n\nmade this finding on the special verdict form, and it has not been\n\n\n                                    -40-\n\fchallenged on appeal.          FedEx contends, however, that Soto did not\n\nmeet    his      burden   of   demonstrating     that    FedEx     had   abused    the\n\nprivilege.         FedEx cites Cabrero Muñiz v. Zayas Seijo, 2006 WL\n\n1313775 (P.R. 2006),20 for the proposition that \"bad investigation\n\nallows      an    inference     [of]    real    malice     only     in   exceptional\n\ncircumstances and with the benefit of other evidence tending to\n\nshow    such     malice.\"      That    case    concerned   the     \"actual   malice\"\n\nrequirement in the context of defamation of a public figure, not an\n\ninquiry into abuse of the conditional privilege.                   However, even if\n\nwe were to conclude that the same standard applies to determine\n\n\"improper motive\" in the privilege inquiry, the jury was entitled\n\nto infer that the circumstances here were sufficiently exceptional\n\nto allow liability to attach.\n\n               The jury heard evidence from which it could reasonably\n\nconclude that FedEx was on notice of the questionable validity of\n\nthe cocaine allegations as early as June 6, when Soto called Pérez\n\nand Medina to report that Iris Romero had received the package\n\nwithout incident.         FedEx insisted at trial that Soto was dismissed\n\nfor his violation of the employee shipping policy, not for shipping\n\ndrugs.      As a result, no investigation of the drug allegations was\n\nrequired. However, regardless of the reasons behind the dismissal,\n\nonce     FedEx     was    on   notice    that    the     drug     allegations     were\n\n\n\n       20\n      The English translation of this case is not available on\nWestlaw. We have relied on a certified slip translation.\n\n                                         -41-\n\fquestionable, it was obligated to either stop repeating them or\n\nadequately investigate them.         It did neither.       As a result, the\n\njury was entitled to conclude that FedEx had \"improper motives\" and\n\nthereby lost the benefit of the conditional privilege because it\n\nacted with reckless disregard for the truth.21\n\n           4.    Sufficiency of Evidence on Actual Harm\n\n           FedEx also asserts that it is entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law on the libel claim because Soto failed to prove that\n\nhe suffered emotional distress as a result of the publication of\n\nthe libelous statements, rather than merely as a result of reading\n\nthose statements himself.          We reject this assertion.          The jury\n\ncould have reasonably inferred that Soto's reputation within FedEx\n\nwas   harmed    by    the   connection   between   his   name   and   the   drug\n\nallegations. See Porto, 132 D.P.R. 331 (\"[C]orporate employees are\n\nonly too human and when they learn of a defamatory statement the\n\nreputation of the affected employee is clearly demeaned in the\n\nworkplace.\").        Moreover, Soto did present evidence about the shame\n\nand humiliation he experienced as a direct result of knowing that\n\nthe drug allegations were circulating among FedEx management.                He\n\nexplained, for example, that when he received the letter from\n\n\n\n      21\n      The jury could also have reasonably concluded that, because\nFedEx had not adequately investigated the drug allegations, its\nfrequent repetition of those allegations constituted \"excessive\npublication\" of the defamatory statements, resulting in loss of the\nconditional privilege.      See Porto, 132 D.P.R. 331 (noting\n\"excessive publication\" destroys the conditional privilege).\n\n                                     -42-\n\fSenior Vice President Colomba: \"[L]ife came to an end for me\n\nbecause having a V.P. of the company state that I had sent drugs,\n\ncocaine . . . . My world came to an end, fell on me.\"            No more is\n\nrequired to sustain the jury's finding of liability on the libel\n\nclaim.   See Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 350 (1974)\n\n(describing \"customary types of actual harm inflicted by defamatory\n\nfalsehood [to] include impairment of reputation and standing in the\n\ncommunity,    personal    humiliation,     and    mental   anguish      and\n\nsuffering\"); Fiori v. Truck Drivers, Local 170, 354 F.3d 84, 87\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (noting that \"emotional distress need be no more\n\nthan 'outrage' and 'anger' upon seeing the libelous statements,\n\nsince mental distress is the 'natural result' of libel\" (quoting\n\nShafir   v.   Steele,    727   N.E.2d    1140,   1146   (Mass.     2000))).\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of FedEx's\n\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law on that claim.\n\n                                   IV.\n\n          In addition to its sufficiency challenges, FedEx contends\n\nthat the district court improperly admitted damage testimony that\n\nwas not causally linked to any issue in the case and that this\n\nevidence improperly inflated the jury's damage award. In reviewing\n\nan allegation of evidentiary error, we must consider first whether\n\nthe district court erred and then whether this error was harmful.\n\nAhern v. Scholz, 85 F.3d 774, 786 (1st Cir. 1996).                \"A trial\n\ncourt's error in an evidentiary ruling only rises to the level of\n\n\n                                  -43-\n\fharmful error if a party's substantial right is affected.\"   Id.   To\n\ndetermine whether a substantial right is implicated, we examine\n\n\"the centrality of the evidence and the prejudicial effect of its\n\n. . . inclusion.\"   Id.   Given our disposition of the slander and\n\nIIED claims, we consider only whether the admission of the damage\n\nevidence was prejudicial error that tainted the award on the\n\nsurviving libel claim.\n\n          Over FedEx's objections, the district court allowed Soto\n\nto testify extensively about emotional damages he suffered as a\n\nresult of the financial difficulties his family encountered after\n\nhe lost his job at FedEx.       For example, he testified: \"We don't\n\nhave as much time as we had before to share. . . . I work more.\n\n[My wife] has had to take on providing, giving tutoring services\n\nbecause she is a teacher.        So, she gets home from school and\n\nsometimes when I get home from work she is still dealing with\n\nMartin.   Martin is my young boy and my intimate life was also\n\naffected.\"   More specifically, Soto's counsel asked what problems\n\nhe confronted \"after the situation with FedEx with respect\" to the\n\nchild support payment he owed for another child who lived with his\n\nex-wife, Janet.   He replied:\n\n          Well, since they would take it from my salary\n          check, I had problems with the Family\n          Department which is the one that has to do\n          with child support. I talked with Janet. She\n          is Ricardo's mother. I told her that I had\n          been fired from Federal Express; that I had to\n          take the steps to get another job in order to\n          be able to pay for the child support; that I\n\n                                  -44-\n\f             could not send him the same amount because I\n             didn't know what my salary was going to be.\n             She understood it but since the payment was\n             not reaching the Family Department, well, I\n             was summoned. I was summoned. I asked Janet\n             to write a letter stating that I had sent her\n             the money and she behaved very good with me\n             and so then I submitted it to the judge who\n             was presiding over the case. He lowered the\n             sum . . . .\n\nSoto's counsel then asked how the situation with the child support\n\nmade Soto feel.     He responded: \"It made me feel very bad because\n\nbesides the fact that I would always pay and it would be deducted\n\nfrom my salary, I always made sure that Ricardo wasn't needing\n\nanything.\"\n\n             Soto also testified about his family's need to cancel a\n\nvacation in Florida as a result of his termination:\n\n             I first told my wife's relatives, family in\n             Orlando because they were expecting us to go\n             there on vacation.     So, we had to cancel\n             vacations   because   one   of  the   benefits\n             employees had with FedEx was that we could buy\n             discount[ed] air fare.    We had discount air\n             fare to buy tickets and the manager has to\n             authorize you so you can purchase the ticket\n             and that is when the suspension came up and\n             then termination but by then they were all\n             expecting us. They are all over there and so\n             then after step one [of the GFTP review] we\n             called Lisa's family and told them about the\n             tragedy.\n\n             Soto testified that after his termination he obtained\n\npositions at Caribbean Products and then DHL through connections\n\nwith family and former co-workers.        When Soto was laid-off from\n\nDHL,   his   supervisor   there   recommended   him   for   a   position   at\n\n\n                                   -45-\n\fAdvance, where he worked at the time of trial.                       At FedEx he made\n\n$17.45 per hour, at DHL he started at $9.75, and he was earning\n\nless than that at Advanced at the time of the trial.                            A. 1116.\n\nSoto's    counsel   asked      how    these      lower      earnings    affected         him\n\nemotionally.    He replied: \"Well, right now I depend on my wife to\n\nbe able to pay things for the house.                  I feel impotent because of\n\nwhat I cannot do now.            Before I used to be the head of the\n\nhousehold and now sometimes I have to go to my father-in-law to ask\n\nhim for help and I do it now very embarrassed because I never did\n\nthat before.\"22\n\n            There was never any testimony, however, establishing that\n\nCaribbean    Products,    DHL,       or    Advanced      ever     saw   the     libelous\n\nstatements published by FedEx.             There was no testimony that Soto's\n\nsubsequent    employers'       knowledge         of   his     termination     at    FedEx\n\nadversely    impacted    his    job       placement      or   pay.      There      was    no\n\ntestimony that he was not hired at any other company to which he\n\napplied as a result of the events at FedEx.\n\n            Soto's financial struggles and the emotional turmoil they\n\ncaused have no causal connection to the libel claim.                     Instead, the\n\nemotional distress Soto described is causally related only to the\n\nfact of termination and thus is evidence only of the damages\n\n\n\n     22\n      Similar testimony was also offered by Rosario's father, who\nexplained that he \"had to help them pay[] the studies of the little\nboy . . . at La Piedad School . . . [and also help pay for] some\nsports studies he was taking.\"\n\n                                          -46-\n\fsuffered by Soto as a result of the wrongful termination itself.\n\nThese damages were not properly before the jury because, as we have\n\nexplained, such damages are compensable only pursuant to Act 80,\n\nwhich specifies a statutorily calculated damage award based on an\n\nemployee's salary and years of service.      That statute does not\n\npermit the recovery of emotional distress damages for a wrongful\n\ntermination.\n\n           Soto's testimony regarding the emotional suffering he\n\nendured as a result of his economic struggles would have been\n\nadmissible and relevant to prove Soto's damages if he had supplied\n\na causal link between his economic hardships and the defamatory\n\nstatements made by FedEx.   For example, Soto might have introduced\n\nevidence that, after his termination by FedEx, a prospective\n\nemployer heard the drug allegations and, as result, refused to\n\noffer him a job.   However, such a causal link was never established\n\nhere.23   Soto did not introduce any evidence suggesting that a\n\nsubsequent employer or potential employer treated Soto adversely as\n\na result of the defamatory statements made by FedEx.   Indeed, Soto\n\nfailed to show that those statements were ever published to anyone\n\noutside of FedEx.    In the absence of such evidence, the powerful\n\n\n\n     23\n      The district court apparently believed that evidence linking\nthe statements and Soto's financial difficulty would be introduced\nand ruled that this damage testimony could come in because Soto was\nentitled to show the emotional harm he suffered as a result of\nFedEx's defamatory statements reaching future employers. However,\nat the end of the trial, this causal link was still missing.\n\n                                -47-\n\ftestimony regarding Soto's struggle to pay his child support, his\n\nwife's need to take on more tutoring, their need to cancel their\n\nvacation    to    Florida,   and    their    need   to   rely   financially    on\n\nRosario's father was legally irrelevant to any issue properly\n\nbefore the jury.24     Thus, we conclude that the district court erred\n\nin admitting this testimony.\n\n               We are also convinced that the evidentiary error was not\n\nharmless.      The district court did instruct the jury that, with\n\nregard to damages for defamation, \"any award you choose to make to\n\ncompensate the Plaintiff may only be to redress the consequences\n\nwhich followed from the injury to the Plaintiff's reputation,\" and\n\nthat \"Plaintiffs cannot recover emotional damages that arise as a\n\nresult    of   the   mere    fact   that    Soto    Lébron's    employment    was\n\nterminated.\"       However, the erroneously admitted evidence was the\n\nmost emotionally compelling and specific damage evidence Soto\n\npresented.       It would have been nearly impossible for the jury to\n\nignore the harsh consequences to Soto and his family stemming from\n\nhis wrongful termination.\n\n\n\n\n     24\n       Such evidence was also irrelevant to the IIED claim, even if\nthat were a viable claim, because there was never any suggestion\nthat FedEx's security interview or \"course of conduct\" rendered\nSoto so emotionally incapacitated as to make him unable to look for\nwork, find work, or perform well on the job.        Thus, there is\nnothing to link the financial hardships the family experienced\nfollowing the termination to the allegedly outrageous conduct of\nFedEx.\n\n                                      -48-\n\f           Indeed, the size of the $3 million libel award confirms\n\nthat impossibility. In its remittitur decision, the district court\n\nsummarized the damage evidence as follows:\n\n           Plaintiffs presented a picture of a forty-six\n           year old father of two who, after a successful\n           fourteen-year tenure at Federal Express, was\n           faced with a false accusation that he had\n           mailed drugs and had to endure the fact that\n           such accusation was reproduced in several\n           written communications between his supervisors\n           and other members of Defendant's management\n           team. Furthermore, Plaintiffs emphasized the\n           distress attendant to Co-plaintiff Soto's\n           interview with Defendant's security specialist\n           and his subsequent physical ouster of the\n           company's premises.      Plaintiff's evidence\n           showed that Co-plaintiff Soto was distraught,\n           humiliated, even with regards to his family,\n           had trouble sleeping and suffered from\n           anxiety, was generally unhappy and lost\n           interest in his former pastimes. Plaintiffs'\n           evidence also demonstrated that Co-plaintiff\n           Soto was affected to such a degree that he had\n           to seek out mental health services and take\n           medication.\n\nThis summary does not distinguish between the emotional damages\n\nproperly attributable to the libel claim and those related only to\n\nthe economic damages caused by the termination.         This same failure\n\nto distinguish by the jury affected a $3 million libel award that\n\nwas grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the damages causally\n\nrelated to the libel.\n\n           Emotional damages, though difficult to quantify, are not\n\nimmune from appellate review.         Koster v. Trans World Airlines,\n\nInc., 181 F.3d 24, 34-35 (1st Cir. 1999).             Here, the evidence\n\nreveals   that   Soto   was   not   disabled   –   either   permanently   or\n\n                                    -49-\n\ftemporarily – by his emotional distress.             He was able to find a new\n\njob and continue working within his field.              Moreover, he did not\n\nintroduce    any    medical   evidence     to   prove   the   severity    of    his\n\ndistress.     Id. at 35 (\"[A]lthough emotional damages are warranted\n\neven without medical or psychiatric evidence, the lack of such\n\nevidence is relevant to the amount of award.\").                 Thus, given the\n\nenormous size of the award here, it appears that the erroneously\n\nadmitted damage evidence tainted the verdict by leading the jury to\n\ncompensate Soto not only for the emotional damages stemming from\n\nthe defamation but also for the emotional distress he suffered as\n\na result of his economic woes following the termination.\n\n             The    prejudicial   effect    of   the    erroneously      admitted\n\nevidence could have been removed by a sufficient remittitur.\n\nHowever, the remitted $1.8 million award remains far beyond the\n\ndamages supported by Soto's properly admitted, causally valid\n\ndamage evidence.      See Sanchez v. Puerto Rico Oil Co., 37 F.3d 712,\n\n724   (1st   Cir.    1994)    (holding   that    a   remitted    award    may   be\n\noverturned if \"the reduced figure remains so extravagant as to\n\nshock the appellate conscience.\"); Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d\n\n196, 215 (1st Cir. 1987) (reviewing a remitted verdict to determine\n\nwhether the appellant has shown that \"the reduced sums remain so\n\nexorbitant, so disturbing to our collective conscience, as to\n\nentitle [it] to [a] new trial[]\").\n\n\n\n\n                                     -50-\n\f          The two cases cited by the district court in support of\n\nits remittitur suggest that the remitted award should have been far\n\nlower.   First, the district court cited Shaffer v. State of Ariz.\n\nCitizens Clean Election Comm'n, No. 03CV2344PHXFJM, 2006 WL 155880,\n\nat *3 (D. Ariz. Jan. 19, 2006), noting that the judge there had\n\nreduced the damages on a defamation claim by 40% \"because the jury\n\ntook into account damages stemming from plaintiff's termination.\"\n\nThis characterization of Shaffer suggests that the district court\n\nin Soto's case may have been aware of the causation problems in the\n\ndamage testimony. However, the Shaffer case itself illustrates why\n\nthe district court's remittitur here was insufficient to cure the\n\nevidentiary error.\n\n          In Shaffer, a government employee had been wrongfully\n\naccused of felony fraud by his employer and the accusation was\n\nreleased to the media and appeared in the news.   The district court\n\nreduced the $1.1 million damages award to $660,000.     Unlike Soto,\n\nShaffer's prospective employers had been exposed to the defamatory\n\nstatements through the media.   Id. at *2.   However, the trial court\n\nnoted that Shaffer, like Soto, had \"failed to produce any evidence\n\nthat prospective employers considered the defamatory statement in\n\nrejecting Shaffer's employment applications.\"       Id. at *3.   The\n\nShaffer court also noted a causation problem within the damage\n\naward: \"Moreover, it is equally plausible that Shaffer's difficulty\n\nin finding employment following his termination arose substantially\n\n\n                                -51-\n\ffrom the fact that he was dismissed from his prior position.\n\nSimilarly, his emotional and reputation difficulties logically\n\narose in part from his termination.\"    Id.   In Soto's case, where\n\nthere was no evidence that any prospective employer was exposed to\n\nthe defamatory statements, it is not merely \"equally plausible\"\n\nthat his economic difficulties, and the emotional distress they\n\ncaused, were unrelated to the defamatory statements.     It is, in\n\nfact, the only reasonable inference.   Nonetheless, Soto's remitted\n\nverdict remains nearly three times larger than the remitted verdict\n\nin Shaffer.\n\n          The second case cited by the district court, McCann v.\n\nRuiz, 802 F. Supp. 606 (D.P.R. 1992), similarly does not support\n\nthe $1.8 million remitted award.   In that case, the court observed\n\nthat the plaintiff had \"suffered a mild form of depression and was\n\nconcerned about his future and the future of his family\" as a\n\nresult of his employer's defamatory statements.        Id. at 616.\n\nHowever, noting that the plaintiff's suffering \"apparently did not\n\nrequire treatment nor . . . result in any permanent injury,\" the\n\ndistrict court found the jury's award of $255,000 to be \"grossly\n\nexcessive\" and ordered a remitted award of $100,000.     Id.   Soto\n\narguably suffered a marginally more severe injury than McCann\n\nbecause he sought treatment from a psychiatrist.     However, that\n\ndistinction between the cases cannot support the enormous variance\n\nbetween the size of Soto's award and the award in McCann.\n\n\n                               -52-\n\f           The remittitur in Budet-Correa v. United Parcel Service,\n\n322 F. Supp. 2d 139 (D.P.R. 2004), provides another pertinent point\n\nof comparison.       In that case, the court reduced a jury award of\n\n$825,000 in emotional distress damages to an employee of UPS who\n\nwas accused of attempted murder and received a death threat from a\n\nsecurity officer hired by the company to surveil him.25               The\n\nplaintiff in that case introduced testimony from his treating\n\npsychologist to establish that he had an anxiety disorder. He also\n\nintroduced evidence that he had been declared disabled and received\n\nSocial    Security     disability   benefits   as   a   result   of   the\n\npsychological injury attributable to UPS's conduct.        Despite this\n\nevidence, the court concluded that the jury award was \"grossly\n\ndisproportionate to the injuries established by the evidence\" and\n\nreduced the award to $250,000.      Id. at 142.   Soto's damage evidence\n\ndid not include any expert psychological testimony and did not come\n\nclose to establishing that he was disabled by his emotional injury.\n\nGiven these comparisons, the $1.8 million award here remains\n\nshockingly exorbitant.\n\n           The district court's task was to determine the maximum\n\ndollar amount that is supported by the evidence.        Conjugal P'ship\n\nComprised by Joseph Jones & Verneta G. Jones v. Conjugal P'ship\n\n\n     25\n      The theory of liability in Budet-Correa was intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress (based upon the death threat by\nthe security officer), rather than libel, but the case is\nnevertheless instructive as to the valuation of emotional damages.\n\n\n                                    -53-\n\fComprised by Arthur Pineda & Toni Pineda, 22 F.3d 391, 398 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).    The Shaffer, McCann, and Budet-Correa cases do not\n\nsupport the district court's determination of that maximum dollar\n\namount here.     If Shaffer's $1.1 million jury award, McCann's\n\n$255,000 award, and Budet-Correa's $825,000 award were each grossly\n\nexcessive, they cannot help to explain why a $1.8 million award in\n\nSoto's case is appropriate.26\n\n          This is not a case where we are merely second-guessing\n\nthe amount of the district court's remittitur.     See Sanchez, 37\n\nF.3d at 724 (noting that when the district court has already\n\n\n     26\n      In searching for similar verdicts to guide our review of the\nlevel of emotional damages here, we follow the lead of the parties\nand the district court and consider cases from both Puerto Rico and\nother U.S. jurisdictions. These cases universally suggest that the\n$1.8 million dollar award is grossly excessive.         See, e.g.,\nWhitfield v. Meléndez-Rivera, 431 F.3d 1, 18 (1st Cir. 2005)\n(reducing award from $500,000 to $100,000 for mother of plaintiff\nwho was shot twice in the leg by police officers; mother testified\nthat \"she was so distraught that she could not work for a month\");\nPeoples Bank & Trust Co. of Mountain Home v. Globe Int'l Publ'g,\nInc., 978 F.2d 1065, 1071 (8th Cir. 1992) (jury verdict of $650,000\nremanded for \"substantial remittitur\" where damage evidence was\n\"limited to testimony describing [the plaintiff] as angry, upset,\nhumiliated, embarrassed, depressed and disturbed\"); Rady v. Forest\nCity Enters., Inc., 501 N.E.2d 688, 690 (Ohio Com. Pl. 1986)\n(vacating a $1,000,000 compensatory award in a libel case where\n\"[p]laintiff's discharge and the underlying accusations were not\ndisclosed to persons outside the immediate group composed of her\nsupervisors and those responsible for hiring and firing\"). The\ncases cited by Soto in support of the $1.8 million award each\ninvolve the defamation of individuals who were prevented, by the\ndefamation, from returning to work in their chosen fields. See,\ne.g., Purgess v. Sharrock, 33 F.3d 134 (2d Cir. 1994) (upholding\n$3.5 million award, which appears to have encompassed both\nemotional distress and lost future wages, for anesthesiologist\nbased on defamatory statements accusing him of malpractice and\npreventing him from finding work in a private hospital).\n\n                                -54-\n\fordered a remittitur, the appellate court's review of the remaining\n\naward is permissible, but quite constrained).          Here, there is an\n\nidentifiable legal error that is at the heart of the jury's\n\ninflated award.27      We cannot discern from the court's remittitur\n\ndecision whether an awareness of this legal error may have been a\n\nfactor in that decision.            In any case, the district court's\n\nremittitur was insufficient to correct the legal error in admitting\n\nthe causally flawed damage testimony. Accordingly, we conclude that\n\nthe   damage   award   has   been   prejudicially   tainted   and   must   be\n\nvacated.28\n\n\n\n      27\n      In some cases, an appellate court that finds a jury's verdict\nto be grossly disproportionate to the injuries established by the\nevidence may order its own remittitur, setting the proper amount of\nthe verdict without the need for a second trial on damages. See 11\nCharles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal\nPractice and Procedure: Civil 2d § 2820 (\"If the appellate court\nconcludes that the verdict is excessive, it need not necessarily\nreverse and order a new trial.         It may give plaintiff an\nalternative by ordering a new trial unless plaintiff will consent\nto a remittitur in a specified amount.\"); see also, e.g., Koster,\n181 F.3d at 36 (concluding that \"the evidence of emotional distress\nwould support a maximum recovery of emotional damages of $250,000\"\nand conditioning a new trial on damages on plaintiff's rejection of\nthat lower amount); Marchant v. Dayton Tire & Rubber Co., 836 F.2d\n695, 704 (1st Cir. 1988) (setting remittitur at $300,000). In such\ncases, there is generally no identifiable legal error that accounts\nfor the inflated award.      In this case, where an identifiable\nevidentiary error directly affected the valuation of Soto's\nemotional distress, we conclude that our best course of action is\nto remand for a new trial rather than attempting to derive a\nmaximum recovery amount from the flawed evidentiary record.\n      28\n      Rosario's derivative award of $1 million was affected by the\nsame evidentiary error and, additionally, includes damages for the\nemotional distress attributable to the now-vacated slander and IIED\nverdicts, and must also be vacated.\n\n                                     -55-\n\f            We also conclude that our decision to vacate the damage\n\naward for libel does not require us to vacate the liability finding\n\nas well.   The district court used a detailed special verdict form,\n\nand appropriate instructions, that required the jury to keep its\n\nliability determination separate from its valuation of the damages.\n\nThus, we conclude that the evidentiary error that skewed the damage\n\naward here did not taint the finding of liability for libel.   That\n\nfinding was, as we describe above, amply supported by admissible\n\nevidence. Moreover, we are confident that the damage issue is \"'so\n\ndistinct and separable from the other issues that a trial of [that]\n\nissue[] alone may be had without injustice.'\"     La Plante v. Am.\n\nHonda Motor Co., 27 F.3d 731, 738 (1st Cir. 1994); Mandel v. Boston\n\nPhoenix, Inc., 456 F.3d 198, 210 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"In the final\n\nanalysis, then, the scope of a remand is normally a judgment call\n\nfor the appellate court.\").     As a result, the damages may be\n\nretried as the sole issue on remand.    The newly constituted jury\n\nwill be able to evaluate Soto's damages after hearing only the\n\nevidence that is causally related to the libel claim.\n\n                                 V.\n\n           Although FedEx has prevailed on most of its appellate\n\nissues, its happiness with that outcome should be muted.       The\n\ncompany's termination of Soto's employment was handled badly, even\n\nthough Soto himself bears some responsibility for his predicament\n\nbecause of his violation of the company's employee shipping policy.\n\n\n                                -56-\n\fStill, for reasons that remain murky, FedEx never secured the lab\n\nreport, completed while the review of Soto's termination was still\n\nunderway, which demonstrates that the suspicious substance in the\n\npackage that Soto shipped was not liquid cocaine.    This failure to\n\nsecure that exculpatory drug report cost Soto his job and caused\n\nmuch of the misery for the Soto family that followed.   Even though\n\nthe jury's evaluation of this sad story cannot withstand appellate\n\nreview for the reasons cited herein, FedEx should understand that\n\njudgment of the jury for what it was – a sharp rebuke for the\n\ncompany's handling of Soto's termination.\n\n          In summary, we affirm the district court's grant of\n\nFedEx's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the slander\n\nclaim.   We reverse the district court's denial of FedEx's motion\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law on the IIED claim.    We affirm the\n\ndistrict court's denial of FedEx's motion for judgment as a matter\n\nof law on the libel claim, but vacate the damage awards for both\n\nSoto and Rosario on the libel claim.   We remand for a new trial on\n\ndamages relating to the libel claim.   Each party shall bear its own\n\ncosts.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -57-\n\f",

Isom, with whom Carl Schuster, Mariela Rexach-Rexach, and Schuster Aguilo LLP were on brief, for appellants.</p>\n<p>Before LIPEZ and HOWARD, Circuit Judges, and SMITH,<sup>[*]</sup> District Judge.</p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs Luis R. Soto-Lebron (\"Soto\") and his wife, Elizabeth Rosario Domenech (\"Rosario\"), sued Soto's former employer, Federal Express Corporation (\"FedEx\"), following Soto's termination by the company for a violation of company rules.<sup>[1]</sup> The plaintiffs asserted emotional damages arising from libel, slander, and intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\").<sup>[2]</sup> Soto also claimed statutory damages for wrongful termination pursuant to P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29 §§ 185a-185m (\"Act <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> 80\"). The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs on all claims and awarded a total of $7,014,910.74 in damages. The district court then granted FedEx's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the slander claim and ordered a remittitur on the IIED and libel awards, reducing the total award to $4,014,910.74. FedEx appeals the sufficiency of the evidence to support the liability findings and the damage awards, except on the Act 80 claim. Soto cross-appeals the judgment as a matter of law on his slander claim.</p>\n<p>As we shall explain more fully below, FedEx badly mishandled the termination of Soto. It conducted a sloppy investigation of his alleged misconduct before firing him. There are grounds for the indignation that the jury apparently felt about the performance of the company. Nevertheless, any such indignation cannot overwhelm the legal rules that courts must apply to the claims of liability and the award of damages in a case such as this. Therefore, after a careful review of the record, we have concluded that Soto did not introduce sufficient evidence to establish FedEx's liability for slander and IIED, and hence we must vacate those jury verdicts. There was sufficient evidence to support liability for libel, and hence we affirm the jury's liability finding on that claim. However, we have concluded that the admission of irrelevant evidence tainted the jury's damage calculation and that taint was not cured by the remittitur. Accordingly, we remand for a new trial on damages on the libel claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Given the challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict. <i>Davignon v. Hodgson,</i> 524 F.3d 91, 96 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>On May 30, 2002, Soto, a fourteen-year employee of FedEx, shipped a package through FedEx to Kissimmee, Florida. Soto's wife, Rosario, a schoolteacher, had given it to him after packaging it in her classroom with fellow teacher Loyda Romero. Rosario asked Soto to send the box, which contained hair care products, to Iris Romero, Loyda's sister, in Florida. Soto shipped it using the FedEx employee discount policy, which permits employees and members of their immediate families to send packages at discounted rates.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Security Interview</h2>\n<p>When Soto arrived at work on June 6, 2002, he was told that security wanted to speak to him. He was taken to a conference room where Jose Pérez, a FedEx security specialist, was waiting for him.<sup>[4]</sup> Pérez said: \"Sit there. I am Jose Pérez from security.\" Throughout the interview Pérez remained seated, \"leaning back on the chair.\" Pérez told Soto that he \"had a problem.\" Pérez showed Soto the airway-bill <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> for the package Soto had shipped to Florida and asked him if he recognized the bill. Soto said that he \"had filled it out to send Iris Romero the package, the gift.\"</p>\n<p>Pérez then told Soto that \"there were problems with that package, that the package had been seized at the station where the package ended up.\" Soto asked what type of problem the package had, and Pérez responded that the package \"had controlled substances, drugs\" and that it \"had been retained\" by police. Soto told him \"that is impossible.\" Pérez responded by stating that \"they had evidence, that they had laboratory reports and police records that there were drugs there.\" Soto testified that Pérez \"had some papers on top of the conference room table and during interrogation he pull[ed] out a document from the documents he had there that he said were evidence of the drugs and he said `I have a lab test' and throughout the interview would show the document like this. . . . [H]e waived [sic] the document to me and put it away.\" Pérez continued \"asking [Soto] to tell the truth\" and repeating that \"they had evidence.\"</p>\n<p>Pérez said he had been a police officer. He said that he had \"left the police because he was not in agreement with the abuse of the police and to tell him the truth, that if [Soto] told him the truth, he would help [him].\" Soto testified that Pérez's tone of voice and demeanor during the interview were \"strong[,] . . . intimidating, with authority.\"</p>\n<p>After \"25 or 20 minutes\" of interrogation by Pérez, Pedro Contreras, another FedEx security specialist, entered the conference room and Pérez left. Soto described Contreras as \"more at ease, more peaceful than Pérez because Pérez was acting with authority.\" Soto explained that the substance of Contreras's questioning was the same as that of Pérez, but that Contreras's approach was \"quieter\" and \"calmer.\" Soto continued to deny that drugs had been in the package. The questioning by Contreras lasted \"about 20 minutes.\"</p>\n<p>Then, Pérez and Rolando Medina, the station manager, came into the room, and Pérez said, \"This guy has to be suspended because he sent drugs through the system.\" Medina left the room and returned with a letter of suspension, which Soto signed. The suspension letter indicated that an investigation would be conducted and advised Soto to contact his manager each morning. The letter also stated, \"[Y]our [sic] are not to contact any FedEx location or customers without management approval.\" At the end of the interview, Soto also prepared and signed a statement indicating that he had shipped the package on behalf of Loyda Romero as a favor and that he did not know the contents of the package.</p>\n<p>Following the security interview, Soto told the FedEx officials that he had to go back to his delivery truck to retrieve his belongings. Pérez said, \"You can't do that. Just stop right there.\" Instead, Pérez and Contreras retrieved Soto's belongings. Then another FedEx employee escorted Soto outside to the security check point where he got into his personal vehicle. As Soto was being escorted outside, he passed by an area where he would be able to see clients or customers of FedEx. He reported seeing one person in that area. Medina told Soto as he was being escorted outside that he should \"calm down, to be at ease, not do anything crazy.\"</p>\n<p>Soto explained that after the interrogation he \"was nervous, confused.\" He said: \"I was shaking. I could not swallow. I was not well. I was like crazy. I was like I was crazy.\" When he left FedEx, he was scared. He explained, \"I didn't know what I was going to do, where I was going to go and then thinking that I was going to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> be arrested because what I was told inside was that the package contained drugs.\" When he arrived home, he told his wife he had been suspended. He testified that \"[s]he got hysterical. She started crying, yelling and I tried to be strong and to calm her down but I wasn't [able] to do so because we were both in the same condition.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. FedEx Proceeds to Terminate Soto</h2>\n<p>Soon after Soto arrived home, he and Rosario called Iris Romero. Iris reported that she had received the package without incident. Soto and Rosario were relieved, concluding that there must have been a misunderstanding or a mistake. Soto immediately called Security Specialist Pérez to tell him that Iris had received the package. According to Soto's testimony, Pérez told him \"that the package was at the Federal Express station. That there was a test made by Becton and Dickinson<sup>[5]</sup> and that there was a police report.\"</p>\n<p>Because he perceived that Pérez did not believe him, Soto then called Medina, the FedEx station manager, to explain the situation. He gave Medina the telephone number for Iris and asked him to call her, but Medina did not call. Medina repeated what Pérez had said: that a lab test had been conducted by Becton and Dickinson and that there was a police report. He told Soto that the police had the package.</p>\n<p>Soto called in to FedEx every morning, as he had been instructed to do in his suspension letter. Each morning, he asked to speak to Medina and was instead transferred to Operations Manager Alberto Calero, Soto's immediate supervisor. Each morning, Calero responded that \"they were dealing with the case.\" On June 11, Calero prepared and filed a report stating: \"Investigation by Specialist Pérez revealed that on 5-30-02, Soto shipped [airwaybill number] for a friend of his wife, in violation of FedEx policy 7-35 [the employee reduced rate policy] as admitted by him during a taped recorded interview. Further investigation by the Orange County Sheriff Dept., Orlando, FL revealed that the package contained an undetermined amount of liquid cocaine. Soto was suspended and consequently terminated for the above violation.\"</p>\n<p>On June 13, Soto was told to come into the station at three in the afternoon. Soto was brought into a conference room where Calero gave him a termination letter. Soto testified:</p>\n<blockquote>Calero signs my letter of dismissal, of termination and he hadn't done any investigation so I asked him, \"Calero, why did you do this? You didn't do any investigation. Why are you doing this? What did you do with the information I gave Rolando Medina? Calero, why did you do this\" because he had told me that he hadn't done any investigation and if he didn't do any investigation, how can he sign the paper saying that an investigation had been done?</blockquote>\n<p>Calero responded that Soto \"was responsible for what [his] family did.\" Soto asked to speak to Pérez. Medina responded that he was not available. Soto said, \"[W]ell, he is not here because he [knows] that what he had accused me of was a lie because the package had been delivered and nothing had happened. There hadn't been any arrests. I had not been interrogated by any police officer.\"</p>\n<p>Soto's termination letter, dated June 13, 2002, stated: \"A thorough investigation of an alleged violation of the Employee reduced-rate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> Shipping Policy 7-35 has determined that you allowed your employee reduced rate privileges to be utilized to ship a package for an ineligible person. In addition, the shipment allowed an illegal substance to be transported through the system in further violation of FedEx policies.\"</p>\n<p>Soto's termination letter informed him that he could invoke review procedures under the FedEx \"Guaranteed Fair Treatment Procedure/EEO Complaint Process\" (\"GFTP\") by submitting a request for review. He did so in a written statement on June 17, asking the company to further investigate the allegation that the package contained drugs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. FedEx's Investigation into the Contents of the Package</h2>\n<p>At the time of the initial security interview, neither Pérez nor Contreras, the two security specialists, had a copy of a police report or a lab report identifying the contents of the package as illegal drugs. Pérez testified that, prior to questioning Soto, he had been briefed by Contreras, who told him that \"the package had been stopped by law enforcement in Orlando because allegedly it had a drug alert and they did some testing and whatever.\" Later the same day, Pérez sent an email to Medina, the station manager, stating that the package contained approximately one kilogram of cocaine. The email also stated that Pérez had made a call to investigate further and learned \"that not only was there a K-9 alert, a field test conducted but, the contents were analyzed by the FDLE (Florida Dept. of Law Enforcement).\"<sup>[6]</sup> Medina forwarded this email to his supervisor, Managing Director Roby Brown, and Maruchi Torres, the acting manager of human resources.</p>\n<p>Some time after the interview, Pérez also telephoned John Matlock, a FedEx security specialist assigned to Orlando, asking for further documentation regarding the incident. On June 13, Matlock faxed a copy of the incident report filed by the sheriff's office in Orange County, Florida to Pérez. The incident report, which was admitted at trial to show what FedEx knew  rather than for its truth  states that a K-9 alert identified the package as containing narcotics. The police officer then obtained a search warrant and opened the package. Inside, the officer found a \"30 cc syring [sic] bottle\" with a white substance in it. The officer stated that he did a \"field persumptive [sic] test\" on the substance and the \"test resulted positive for the presence of cocaine.\"</p>\n<p>It is now clear that the package Soto shipped did not have cocaine in it. At trial, the judge admitted a lab report indicating that the 30 cc bottle taken from Soto's package tested negative for cocaine.<sup>[7]</sup> The report, completed by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE), is dated June 25, 2002-twelve days after Soto's termination, but while the company's GFTP review of that decision was ongoing.</p>\n<p>When the plaintiffs sought to introduce the FDLE lab report into evidence during their case in chief, FedEx objected on the basis that there was nothing to link the report to Soto's package. The trial judge <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> observed that FedEx had the lab report throughout the lengthy discovery period in the case, and had filed numerous motions in limine as to other evidentiary concerns, but had never before raised the linkage issue. As a result, the trial judge allowed the plaintiffs time to request a document linking the lab report to the police officer's incident report and then allowed the plaintiffs to introduce that document, along with the lab report, as rebuttal evidence after one of FedEx's witnesses testified about the initial K-9 alert and field presumptive test.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>In sum, the evidence indicates that the package Soto shipped was stopped by law enforcement personnel after field testing indicated the presence of cocaine. A subsequent lab report revealed that the package contained no illicit drugs. There is no evidence to suggest that FedEx was aware of the existence of this lab report prior to the commencement of Soto's litigation. There is also no evidence to suggest that anyone at FedEx ever specifically asked for or tried to locate the FDLE lab test results at any time prior to the commencement of litigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. The GFTP Review Process</h2>\n<p>On June 18, Operations Manager Calero and Station Manager Medina each wrote memoranda explaining the management rationale for Soto's termination. Calero's memorandum stated: \"After reviewing the Security Investigation outcome it was determined, that Luis R. Soto sent a package for a friend of his wife using his FedEx Employee reduced rate-shipping discount. In addition, this violation of FedEx Policy allowed illegal substances to be shipped through the system.\" Medina's memorandum stated: \"Luis R. Soto admitted in a conversation with me and Security Specialist Jose Pérez, that in fact he shipped a package for a friend of his wife using his employee discount and that he was not aware of its contents. The airwaybill utilized had Luis Soto's name as the shipper. This violation of the Employee Reduced-Rate Shipping policy allowed an illegal substance to be transported through the FedEx system. Some other factors considered were; that if we allow this to happen based on the premises that the contents were not of the employees [sic] knowledge we will be establishing a precedent for future situations of this magnitude. The ultimate responsible [sic] for any shipment sent through the FedEx system is the shipper.\"</p>\n<p>On June 19, Soto met with Managing Director Brown, who gave him copies of the incident report prepared by the police in Florida and the search warrant for the package. Acting Managing Director of Human Resources Torres, Calero, and Medina were also present at the meeting. Two days later, Brown sent Soto a letter upholding the dismissal: \"A review . . . clearly demonstrates that you violated the Employee Reduced Rate Shipping Policy, (P7-35). It also should be noted that the violation of this policy allowed an illegal substance to be transported through the FedEx system, putting your fellow FedEx employees at risk.\"</p>\n<p>Soto initiated the second step of the GFTP process on June 27 with a letter to Julio Colomba, a FedEx Senior Vice President. He asked, \"Where is the lab report that indicates the presence of illegal substances?\" On July 8, John Matlock, the Orlando security specialist, sent an email to Jesus Rodriguez, a human resources person who was working on the investigation, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> summarizing the evidence he had about Soto's package:</p>\n<blockquote>The local Police Officer tested the contents and it tested positive. The cocaine was then removed from the pkg and then there was an attempt to deliver. There was no one home and the package was left at the door in an attempt to find the recpt. The pkg might have been delivered but it was not delivered with the cocaine in it. As far as the written results request, I sent the Security person<sup>[9]</sup> there the only written report from the police officer.</blockquote>\n<p>Colomba did not meet with Soto. Instead, he wrote a letter dated July 12, reaffirming the dismissal and once again stating: \"A review of this issue revealed that you shipped a package through the FedEx system containing an illegal drug (cocaine).\" Colomba's letter was copied to each of the personnel involved in the GFTP process (Brown, Medina, Calero and Rodrguez), as well as Juan Cento (Colomba's boss), Nelly Concepcion (Rodrguez's boss), and Suzanne Gaal (Concepcion's boss). Soto testified that when he received this letter, \"having a VP of the company state [that Soto] had sent drugs, cocaine,\" he felt as if \"[his] world came to an end, [and] fell on [him].\" The GFTP review was finalized with a letter on August 6, 2002. This letter did not state the reason for the termination or refer to illegal substances or any other negative information about Soto.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. The Plaintiffs' Emotional Distress</h2>\n<p>At trial, Soto testified that he had experienced \"[e]motional damages, anxiety,\" sleeping problems, and \"deep sadness\" following the events described above. He saw a psychiatrist ten times (the maximum his health insurance would allow) beginning in October 2002, and was prescribed various medications for anxiety and panic. He explained that he had sought psychiatric treatment because he wanted to feel like himself again: \"I mean that I was a happy man like every Puerto Rican. I wanted to be the heart of the party, to share with my buddies, play basketball and everything that Luis Soto entailed. I wasn't able to sleep. I would wake up every night at midnight. I didn't know what time it was but I couldn't sleep.\" He described himself as \"anxious always without being able to talk.\" When asked specifically about damage to his reputation, Soto testified: \"It was said that I had sent drugs in a package and to me that was stab and as of this date, it is still in the record, my record that I transported drugs through the system, illegal substances through the system.\"</p>\n<p>Rosario explained her own emotional distress as stemming from her guilt in having been the one who gave Soto the package and feeling \"impotent to do something to help him.\" She visited a psychiatrist a couple of times and took various antidepressant medications because she was \"in extreme anxiety, very nervous\" and \"had some panic attacks.\"</p>\n<p>The district court also admitted testimony that Soto's co-workers had heard rumors that he was being accused of shipping drugs through the system, and they conveyed those rumors back to Soto. Rosario described these rumors as \"devastating\" for their reputation. She described her husband as having been \"destroyed\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> by the knowledge that these rumors were circulating at FedEx.</p>\n<p>In response to FedEx's interrogatories during discovery, Soto stated that he was seeking damages only for emotional distress. He did not claim economic damages or produce documents that would have supported a claim for lost wages. Soto failed to supplement his answers to interrogatories after economic damages were discussed at various depositions. Accordingly, the court ruled that evidence of Soto's economic damages would be excluded under Fed.R.Civ.P. 37. However, the court permitted testimony regarding \"economic facts . . . to lay the groundwork or foundation for any emotional damages that this plaintiff may have suffered.\" As a result, Soto presented other damage evidence, discussed in more detail below, describing how his family struggled financially as a result of his termination from FedEx and the emotional toll those financial struggles took.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. The Verdict and Appeal</h2>\n<p>In submitting this case to the jury following a ten-day trial, the district court used a special verdict form that required the jury to make specific findings on the particular elements of each cause of action and separate damage awards for each claim on which it found liability. After finding liability as to all claims, the jury returned statutory damages of $14,910 for wrongful discharge, a $1,000,000 award for slander, a $3,000,000 award for libel, a $2,000,000 award for IIED, and a $1,000,000 award for Rosario on her derivative claim. In response to a motion for remittitur and judgment as a matter of law, the district court vacated the slander award, reduced the libel award to $1,800,000, and reduced the IIED award to $1,200,000. The district court did not reduce Rosario's $1,000,000 award, on the ground that FedEx did not argue that it should be remitted.</p>\n<p>FedEx appeals, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence as to liability for IIED and libel, as well as the amount of the damage award, and asserting several other errors, including an evidentiary error in the admission of certain testimony regarding Soto's emotional distress damages. Soto cross-appeals, urging us to reinstate the slander award.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We first consider the backdrop of Puerto Rico's modified at-will employment law, which plays a critical role in this case, and then turn to the issues on appeal. Puerto Rico has altered its at-will employment regime to provide for a statutory damage award when an employee without a fixed-term contract is terminated without good cause. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, §§ 185a-185m. Referred to as Act 80, this statute defines good cause for termination to include, inter alia, \"[t]he employee's repeated violations of the reasonable rules and regulations established for the operation of the establishment, provided a written copy thereof has been opportunely furnished to the employee.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 185b(c). Although the statutory language requires repeated violations, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has stated, and the jury in Soto's case was instructed, that an employer may be justified in terminating an employee after a single violation of the employer's rules if the offense is \"`of such [seriousness or] nature as to reveal an attitude or a character trait so dangerous to the peace and good order of the enterprise, that it would be imprudent to wait for a second offense to separate him from the enterprise.'\" <i>Delgado Zayas v. Hosp. Interamericano de Medicina Avanzada,</i> 137 D.P.R. 643, 1994 P.R.-Eng. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> 908,890 (P.R.1994)<sup>[10]</sup> (quoting <i>Secretario del Trabajo v. I.T.T. W. Hemisphere Directories, Inc.,</i> 108 D.P.R. 536, 544, 8 P.R. Offic. Trans. 564, 569-70 (P.R.1979)). The employer bears the burden of showing that the termination was for good cause. 29 P.R. Laws. Ann. tit. 29, § 185a.</p>\n<p>The statute provides a formula for calculating what amounts to mandatory \"severance pay\" for employees who are wrongfully terminated. <i>Id.</i> The formula provides that the employee is entitled to:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) The salary corresponding to two (2) months, as indemnity, if discharged within the first five (5) years of service; the salary corresponding to three (3) months if discharged after five (5) years and up to fifteen (15) years of service; the salary corresponding to six (6) months if discharged after (15) years of service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) An additional progressive compensation equal to one (1) week for each year of service, if discharged within the first five (5) years of service; to two (2) weeks for each year of service, if discharged after five (5) years and up to fifteen (15) years of service; to three (3) weeks for each year of service if discharged after fifteen (15) years of service.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> For Soto, this formula produced an award of $14,910.74.</p>\n<p>Act 80's damage formula provides the exclusive remedy for wrongful termination of at  will employees in Puerto Rico. <i>Porto v. Bentley P.R., Inc.,</i> 132 D.P.R. 331, 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754,807 (P.R.1992); <i>Arroyo v. Rattan Specialities, Inc.,</i> 117 D.P.R. 35, 65, 17 P.R. Offic. Trans. 43 (P.R.1986); <i>Rivera v. Sec. Nat'l Life Ins. Co.,</i> 106 D.P.R. 517, 527, 6 P.R. Offic. Trans. 727 (P.R.1977) (referencing prior version of the statute). A wrongfully terminated employee cannot recover emotional distress damages for the termination itself. <i>See </i><i>Porto,</i> 132 D.P.R. 331 (\"[T]he only remedy available to an employee for a mere discharge without just cause is that provided by Act No. 80.\"). However, \"if other independent tortious actions concur with the discharge, the employer may be held liable for said conduct.\" <i>Porto,</i> 132 D.P.R. 331. Thus, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has allowed defamation claims to proceed alongside Act 80 claims, holding that an employer's defamatory actions can be considered independent of the discharge. <i>Acevedo Santiago v. W. Digital Caribe, Inc.,</i> 140 D.P.R. 452, 40 P.R. Offic. Trans. ___ (P.R.1996);<sup>[11]</sup><i>Porto,</i> 132 D.P.R. 331.</p>\n<p>At trial, FedEx contended that it was justified in terminating Soto on the basis of his single violation of the employee shipping policy. It argued that the drug allegations were not the cause of the termination; thus, it was not obliged to fully investigate them. Soto argued that the drug allegations were clearly part of FedEx's termination decision and, as a result, they should have been fully investigated. The jury evidently agreed, finding the company liable for wrongful termination.<sup>[12]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> The resulting $14,910.74 award is the only compensation available to Soto for his damages arising from the fact of termination. FedEx has not appealed that award.</p>\n<p>With this discussion as background, we turn to Soto's allegations that FedEx committed \"independent tortious actions\" that caused emotional harm separate from that caused by the discharge, namely his claims of slander, IIED, and libel.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>In assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational jury could find in favor of the party who prevailed. <i>Gillespie v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,</i> 386 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir.2004). Judgment as a matter of law is warranted when \"the presentation of the party's case reveals `no legally sufficient evidentiary basis' for a reasonable jury to find for that party.\" <i>Mag Jewelry Co. v. Cherokee, Inc.,</i> 496 F.3d 108, 117 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(1)). The district court's decision to grant or deny a motion for judgment as a matter of law is reviewed de novo. <i>Mag Jewelry Co.,</i> 496 F.3d at 117; <i>Gillespie,</i> 386 F.3d at 25. In this diversity case, Puerto Rico law governs our sufficiency inquiry. <i>See </i><i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,</i> 304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938); <i>Correa v. Cruisers, a Div. of KCS Int'l,</i> 298 F.3d 13, 22 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Cross-Appeal on Slander Award</h2>\n<p>The district court determined that FedEx was entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to the slander claim because Soto had failed to link rumors regarding the cause of his termination to a FedEx employee acting within the scope of his employment. We agree.</p>\n<p>To establish his slander claim, Soto bore the burden of proving that a FedEx employee, acting within the scope of his employment, transmitted a false and defamatory statement to another person, and that this transmission was negligent  as opposed to merely accidental  and non-privileged.<sup>[13]</sup><i>Corrada Betances v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc.,</i> No. Civ. 99-1671 JP, 2000 WL 33687211, at *4-5 (D.P.R. July 24, 2000), <i>aff'd,</i> 248 F.3d 40 (1st Cir.2001); <i>see also </i><i>Torres Silva v. El Mundo, Inc.,</i> 106 D.P.R. 415, 6 P.R. Offic. Trans. 581, 598 (P.R.1977). Circumstantial evidence may be used to prove that it was the defendant who made a particular  allegedly defamatory  statement. <i>See </i><i>Riisna v. Am. Broad. Cos.,</i> 219 F.Supp.2d 568, 575 (S.D.N.Y.2002); Robert D. Sack, <i>Sack on Defamation</i> § 2.5.1, at *2-85 (Mar.2007) (\"[I]t has been said that circumstantial evidence may be used to establish that the <i>defendant</i> published the allegedly defamatory words. That is not to say, however, that the <i>content</i> of an allegedly defamatory statement can be proven purely through hearsay.\").</p>\n<p>Soto introduced evidence that rumors regarding the reasons for his suspension and dismissal circulated widely among FedEx employees. He testified that he did not tell anyone at FedEx what had happened. Nonetheless, soon after he was suspended, he received inquiries from his coworkers, asking whether it was true that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> he had been suspended because his wife had given him a package containing drugs.</p>\n<p>Soto also introduced testimony that FedEx kept personnel files strictly confidential. One witness testified that, based on his fourteen years with the company, leaked information about an employee could only come from management. However, that same witness also testified that no member of management had told him anything about the reasons for Soto's suspension.</p>\n<p>Soto argues that the evidence that the rumors did not come from Soto himself, and that only management would have had access to the information, allowed the jury to make a reasonable inference that FedEx management personnel were the source of the rumors. However, even if it were logical to infer, as Soto argues, that someone in FedEx management must have said something to someone to start the rumors, that inference falls far short of proving each of the elements of slander. <i>See </i><i>Riisna,</i> 219 F.Supp.2d at 575 (\"There are too many links between any statement by [the defendant], if any there were, and whatever came back to plaintiff or her informants to permit a rational inference that whatever the plaintiff or her informants heard was what [the defendant] said.\"). Soto's circumstantial evidence that the rumors originated with management does not establish whether management personnel spoke negligently, rather than being accidentally overheard. Soto also did not establish that the statements that sparked the rumors were false. For example, management could have stated that Soto's package was stopped by officials after a K-9 alert for drugs. That statement is true and could not be grounds for a slander claim, though it could well have sparked the rumors.</p>\n<p>In sum, the evidence introduced in support of the slander claim \"does not rise to more than informal rumors\" circulating among employees, for which FedEx cannot be held liable. <i>See Corrada Betances,</i> 2000 WL 33687211, at *5. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's judgment as a matter of law in favor of FedEx on this claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</h2>\n<p>Under Puerto Rico law, the elements of a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress are: 1) that the defendant engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct; 2) that such conduct was intended to cause the plaintiff severe emotional distress, or was done with reckless disregard for the plaintiff's emotional state; 3) that the plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress; and 4) that the severe distress is causally related to the extreme and outrageous conduct. <i>Santiago-Ramirez v. Sec'y of Dep't of Defense,</i> 62 F.3d 445, 448 (1st Cir.1995); <i>Camacho v. United States,</i> No. Civ. 04-1816 HL, 2005 WL 2644959, at *7 (D.P.R. May 24, 2005); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46 (1965).</p>\n<p>Because there is limited authority in Puerto Rico case law regarding IIED, we look to the Restatement and the interpretation of IIED claims in other jurisdictions for guidance. <i>Santiago-Ramirez,</i> 62 F.3d at 448 (relying on the Restatement and case law from other jurisdictions in an IIED case under Puerto Rico law). A comment to the Restatement explains that the plaintiff has a heavy burden in proving that the defendant's conduct has been sufficiently offensive to permit a finding of liability:</p>\n<blockquote>It has not been enough that the defendant has acted with an intent which is tortious or even criminal, or that he has intended to inflict emotional distress, or even that his conduct has been characterized by \"malice,\" or a degree of aggravation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> which would entitle the plaintiff to punitive damages for another tort. Liability has been found only where the conduct has been so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community. Generally, the case is one in which the recitation of the facts to an average member of the community would arouse his resentment against the actor, and lead him to exclaim, \"Outrageous!\"</blockquote>\n<p>Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46 cmt. d; <i>see also </i><i>Thorpe v. Mut. of Omaha Ins. Co.,</i> 984 F.2d 541, 545 (1st Cir.1993) (conduct must be \"extreme and outrageous,\" \"beyond all possible bounds of decency,\" and \"utterly intolerable in a civilized community\"). Moreover, when employers have been accused of outrageous conduct toward their employees, courts have afforded employers \"some latitude in investigating possible employee misconduct.\" <i>Santiago-Ramirez,</i> 62 F.3d at 448 (applying Puerto Rico law) (citing <i>Starr v. Pearle Vision, Inc.,</i> 54 F.3d 1548, 1558 (10th Cir. 1995)); <i>Camacho,</i> 2005 WL 2644959, at *7 (applying Puerto Rico law).</p>\n<p>Soto argues that FedEx's treatment of him, \"in its totality, was `extreme and outrageous.'\" He explains that his \"ordeal was not an isolated event but a series of inexcusable acts unrelated to the employment action taken against [him].\" In order to analyze whether FedEx's conduct exceeded the latitude we afford employers in \"investigating possible employee misconduct\" and went \"beyond all possible bounds of decency,\" we must consider the particular actions by FedEx upon which Soto bases his IIED claim: the repeated allegations that he had shipped drugs, the security interview, and the inadequate investigation. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Allegations That Soto Shipped Drugs</h2>\n<p>It is now clear that Soto was accused by FedEx, repeatedly and in writing, of doing something that he did not do: shipping, or allowing someone else to ship, drugs through the FedEx system. Those were egregiously false accusations. Those accusations are precisely the basis of his libel claim. Such a claim cannot be brought in the guise of an IIED claim, which would divorce it from the well developed law of defamation with its attendant privileges and defenses. <i>See </i><i>Demas v. Levitsky,</i> 291 A.D.2d 653, 738 N.Y.S.2d 402, 409 (N.Y.App.Div.2002) (holding that where \"the conduct alleged . . . falls squarely within the scope of plaintiff's defamation claim,\" the plaintiff's IIED claim should have been dismissed); <i>Grimes v. Carter,</i> 241 Cal.App.2d 694, 50 Cal.Rptr. 808, 813 (1966) (holding that \"[i]n circumstances where a plaintiff states a case of libel or slander, [emotional distress] is a matter which may be taken into account in determining the amount of damages to which the plaintiff is entitled, but it does not give rise to an independent cause of action on the theory of a separate tort.\").</p>\n<p>Moreover, the jury here was instructed, without objection, that \"[t]he publication of a defamatory statement does not constitute extreme and outrageous conduct.\" This jury instruction thus became the law of the case and establishes the standard by which we review the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal. <i>Rodriguez-Torres v. Caribbean Forms Manufacturer, Inc.,</i> 399 F.3d 52, 58 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also </i><i>Scott-Harris v. City of Fall River,</i> 134 F.3d 427, 442 &amp; n. 16 (1st Cir.1997), <i>rev'd on other grounds,</i> 523 U.S. 44, 118 S.Ct. 966, 140 L.Ed.2d 79 (1998). Soto seeks to avoid the impact of this jury instruction by asserting that it is the <i>repetition</i> of the defamatory statements that amounts to the \"extreme <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> and outrageous conduct\" here. However, the repetition of the statements is properly analyzed in the context of an abuse of an employer's conditional privilege to speak about an employee. <i>See </i><i>Porto,</i> 132 D.P.R. 331 (describing the elements of conditional privilege). Accordingly, to the extent that Soto's IIED claim is predicated on defamatory statements, the conduct must be considered under the framework of Soto's libel claim, which we address below, and cannot, as a matter of law, satisfy the \"extreme and outrageous conduct\" requirement of the IIED claim.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The Security Interview</h2>\n<p>Soto also points to the security interview as \"extreme and outrageous\" conduct by FedEx. As we noted above, courts have afforded employers \"some latitude in investigating possible employee misconduct.\" <i>Santiago-Ramirez,</i> 62 F.3d at 448 (citing <i>Starr v. Pearle Vision, Inc.,</i> 54 F.3d 1548, 1558 (10th Cir.1995))(applying Puerto Rico law); <i>Camacho,</i> 2005 WL 2644959 at *7 (applying Puerto Rico law).</p>\n<p>In <i>Santiago-Ramirez,</i> we addressed circumstances remarkably similar to the security interview conducted in Soto's case:</p>\n<blockquote>Appellant, Santiago, worked as a cashier at Fort Buchanan's Army Post Exchange Store. The store's policy prohibited employees from carrying merchandise through the front door. On June 29, 1990, Santiago and a co-employee violated this policy when they removed bags containing store merchandise through the front entrance. They placed these bags in the trunk of the co-employee's car. Unbeknownst to Santiago, the bags contained stolen merchandise. The Safety and Security Manager and Santiago's supervisor questioned her for a total of 45 minutes concerning this breach of store policy. Santiago told them that she did not know that the merchandise was stolen but was aware of the store's regulation that prohibited employees from carrying merchandise through the front door. She was later terminated for violating this regulation.</blockquote>\n<p>62 F.3d at 446. During the security interview, Santiago \"was shown a videotape supposedly taken at the store where she worked\" and \"told that if she did not cooperate with the investigation `all of this could be taken to the F.B.I.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 448. We held that \"[b]ecause this questioning was a necessary incident of employment for an employee who had broken the rules, under Puerto Rican law it cannot be said to be intentionally tortious.\" <i>Id.</i> In analyzing Santiago's claim, we drew an analogy to <i>Starr,</i> a Tenth Circuit case which held that \"a plaintiff's allegations that her employer yelled at her, pushed her back down into her chair, touched her arm and blocked her exit from the room during questioning, did not rise to the level of outrageousness required to state a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\" <i>Santiago-Ramirez,</i> 62 F.3d at 448 (describing the holding in <i>Starr,</i> 54 F.3d at 1558).</p>\n<p>Contrasting the facts in <i>Starr</i> and <i>Santiago-Ramirez</i> with those in <i>Kaminski v. United Parcel Service,</i> 120 A.D.2d 409, 501 N.Y.S.2d 871 (N.Y.App.Div.1986), a case cited by the plaintiffs, is instructive in evaluating when an employer's interrogation of an employee suspected of violating company rules crosses over the line into <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> \"outrageous and extreme conduct.\" In <i>Kaminski,</i> UPS security personnel accused the plaintiff, a UPS driver, of \"not having reported the receipt of a cash payment for a package.\" 501 N.Y.S.2d at 872. The plaintiff denied the charge. The security personnel told the plaintiff that he had been identified as the thief by two eyewitnesses. \"They then allegedly began to threaten him with a criminal prosecution and a prison term at Riker's Island if plaintiff did not admit stealing the money, agree to return the money, resign, and waive his rights to all health, hospital and pension benefits.\" <i>Id.</i> The plaintiff alleged that \"for three hours he was subjected to these threats which were accompanied by loud, aggressive, profane and obscene language and gestures.\" <i>Id.</i> He claimed that \"[a]t all times one or another of the defendants was blocking the door to the office.\" <i>Id.</i> Finally, he claimed that after three hours of this ordeal, \"under duress and still denying the accusation, [he] signed resignation papers and documents relinquishing his pension plan and health and hospital benefits and statements admitting his guilt.\" <i>Id.</i> On these facts, the court permitted the employee's IIED claim to survive a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>Comparing the facts in Soto's case with the facts in these three cases leads us to the conclusion that, as a matter of law, the security interview conducted by FedEx does not constitute \"outrageous and extreme conduct.\" The interview established that Soto had used his employee discount to ship a package for his wife's friend without knowledge of its contents in violation of FedEx's policy. The questioning lasted approximately 40-45 minutes, comparable in length to the questioning in <i>Santiago-Ramirez.</i> There was no evidence of any physical intimidation, blocking of the exits, or pushing. Unlike in <i>Kaminski,</i> Security Specialist Pérez did not threaten Soto with a prison sentence, pressure him into resigning and relinquishing his pension plan benefits, or make any other verbal threats. Under these circumstances, it is more accurate to characterize the security interview of Soto as a \"necessary incident of employment for an employee who had broken the rules.\" <i>See </i><i>Santiago-Ramirez,</i> 62 F.3d at 449.</p>\n<p>The most egregious aspect of the interview was Pérez's statement that he had a lab report as he waived a piece of paper in front of Soto. Pérez was, of course, bluffing. He did not have a copy of any document other than the airwaybill at the time of the security interview. However, Pérez had been told by his supervisors that the package was intercepted by police in Florida and had tested positive for cocaine. Under these circumstances, his bluff could not reasonably be considered \"beyond all possible bounds of decency.\"</p>\n<p>Soto also complains that he was \"summarily suspended and publicly escorted off FedEx premises.\" However, these actions are well within the latitude we afford employers investigating employee misconduct. The decision to remove him immediately and accompany him as he left the company property was a reasonable course of action in the face of the allegations against him. Thus, none of the conduct during or immediately following the security interview was \"extreme and outrageous.\"<sup>[15]</sup> It cannot support the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> 3. The Inadequate Investigation</h2>\n<p>Soto points to the inadequacy of the investigation as another aspect of FedEx's outrageous conduct: \"FedEx did little or nothing to obtain the facts, apparently preferring to avoid the truth in favor of a lie.\" The inadequacy of FedEx's investigation to support the allegation that Soto's package contained drugs is unmistakable, and that inadequacy remains a troubling aspect of this case. Soto emphasized that inadequacy as a key element of his argument that FedEx's termination of him was wrongful and, as we describe below, that FedEx had abused its conditional privilege to publish statements about an employee. However, the inadequate investigation is not conduct on the part of FedEx that caused harm to Soto independent of the harms caused by the termination itself and the publication of the libelous statements. The harm arising from the termination is, as we explained above, compensable <i>only</i> under Act 80, and cannot factor into our analysis of IIED. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 185a; <i>Vélez Rodriguez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> 135 D.P.R. 500, 1994 P.R.-Eng. 909576 (P.R.1994) (\"The compensation provided by law is the exclusive remedy for unjust discharge.\"). Similarly, Soto's emotional distress arising from defamatory statements published by the company must be analyzed under the framework of libel law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. The Whole Course of Conduct Theory</h2>\n<p>Soto argues that the sum total of the repeated defamation, the failure to investigate, and the security interview  FedEx's whole course of conduct  amounts to \"extreme and outrageous conduct,\" even if the individual actions by FedEx, taken separately, would not. We cannot agree, particularly when two of the actions cited by Soto  the repeated accusations that he shipped drugs and the inadequate investigation of that claim  cannot be considered as conduct relevant to the IIED claim. Soto has not described any conduct, taken together or separately, that could properly form the basis of a claim for IIED.</p>\n<p>Because Soto has failed to introduce sufficient evidence to support a finding of \"extreme and outrageous conduct\" by FedEx, his IIED claim necessarily fails. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's denial of FedEx's motion for judgment as a matter of law and vacate Soto's $1.2 million remitted damage award on that claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Libel</h2>\n<p>FedEx also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support Soto's libel claim. Under Puerto Rico law, Soto must prove that FedEx negligently published false and defamatory written statements that caused him actual harm. He must also demonstrate that FedEx abused its conditional privilege to speak about its employees. <i>Porto,</i> 132 D.P.R. 331.</p>\n<p>Soto asserts that FedEx published ten false and defamatory statements stating that he illegally shipped drugs:</p>\n<blockquote> \"The aforementioned [airwaybill] contained approximately one kg. of cocaine.\" Email from Security Specialist Pérez to Station Manager Medina, dated June 6, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"[F]urther investigation . . . revealed that the package contained an undetermined amount of liquid cocaine.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> Incident report written by Pérez, dated June 11, 2002.<sup>[16]</sup></blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"A thorough investigation . . . has determined that you . . . allowed an illegal substance to be transported through the system in further violation of FedEx policies.\" Termination letter (copied to Managing Director Brown and Rodrguez, a human resources officer), dated June 13, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"This violation . . . allowed an illegal substance to be transported through the FedEx system.\" GFTP Memorandum prepared by Medina, dated June 18, 2002.<sup>[17]</sup></blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"[T]his violation of FedEx Policy allowed illegal substances to be shipped through the system.\" GFTP Memorandum prepared by Operations Manager Calero, dated June 18, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"A review . . . clearly demonstrates that . . . the violation . . . allowed an illegal substance to be transported through the FedEx system, putting your fellow FedEx employees at risk.\" Letter from Brown to Soto (copied to Medina, Calero, Acting Human Resources Director Torres, and Rodriguez), dated June 21, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"Whether or not Luis Soto was aware of the contents of the package it is clear that by allowing someone other than an immediate relative to utilize his shipping privileges he allowed an illegal substance to be placed in the FedEx system for transportation.\" GFTP Memorandum prepared by Brown, dated July 1, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"In summary, Mr. Soto . . . placed himself and the Company in jeopardy by allowing illegal substances to be transported through the FedEx system.\" GFTP Memorandum prepared by Rodriguez, dated July 2, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"The local Police Officer tested the contents and it tested positive. The cocaine was then removed from the pkg.\" Email from Matlock, the security specialist in Orlando, to Rodriguez, dated July 8, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"A review of this issue revealed that you shipped a package through the FedEx system containing an illegal drug (cocaine).\" Letter from Senior Vice President Colomba to Soto (copied to Brown, Medina, Calero, and Rodriguez, as well as their bosses, Cento, Concepcion, and Gaal), dated July 12, 2002.</blockquote>\n<p>FedEx challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to every element of Soto's libel claim. We address each challenge in turn.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Falsity</h2>\n<p>FedEx insists that Soto failed to establish that the ten allegedly defamatory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> statements were false. FedEx does not assert that the package Soto shipped did, in fact, contain cocaine. Nonetheless, the company argues that even if the FDLE lab results show that Soto's package did not contain cocaine, those results do \"not establish that Bailey, the K-9, did not alert on the package or that the presumptive field test did not return a positive result for cocaine.\" This argument misses the mark. The statements at issue do not assert that the package tested positive for cocaine in the field. Rather, they each conclusively assert that the package actually contained cocaine. Both the FDLE report and the fact that no law enforcement officer ever questioned Soto or Iris Romero about this illegal shipment of drugs permitted the jury to reasonably conclude that the statements were false.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Publication</h2>\n<p>FedEx next argues that Soto failed to establish publication because the statements were published only within FedEx and such intracorporate communications do not satisfy the publication element of the libel claim. This argument reflects an incorrect reading of Puerto Rico law. In <i>Porto,</i> the Puerto Rico Supreme Court expressly adopted the majority rule that intracorporate communication of a defamatory statement satisfies the publication requirement. 132 D.P.R. 331 (\"[W]e hold that the reputation of a person in the workplace may be denigrated through an intracorporate communication and, if there is evidence of the same, the publication requirement is satisfied.\"). FedEx seizes on isolated language later in the opinion, where the court appears to conflate the concepts of publication and privilege by noting that \"[t]he presence of the company personnel manager was completely logical and reasonable\" in a meeting where the allegedly defamatory discharge letter was discussed. <i>Id.</i> However, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's adoption of the rule that the publication requirement is satisfied by intracorporate communications was clear and unequivocal. Thus, the question of whether the internal publication was \"logical and reasonable\" properly belongs in the discussion of conditional privilege, to which we turn next.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Abuse of Conditional Privilege</h2>\n<p>Under Puerto Rico law, communications among \"managers or supervisors of a discharged employee, regarding the reasons for the discharge,\" are conditionally privileged. <i>Porto,</i> 132 D.P.R. 331. This privilege applies to \"`all bona fide communications upon any subject matter in which the author has an interest or with respect to which he has a duty to perform to others.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Caraballo v. P.R. Ilustrado, Inc.,</i> 70 P.R.R. 265, 272 (1949)). It is \"`termed conditional because the person availing himself of it must use it in a lawful manner and for a proper purpose.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Caraballo,</i> 70 P.R.R. at 272). Accordingly, the privilege is lost if the employer abuses it by giving the statement \"excessive publicity\" or by publishing it for \"improper reasons.\"<sup>[19]</sup><i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Although there are no Puerto Rico cases directly on point, case law from other jurisdictions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> suggests that \"improper reasons\" are established and the conditional privilege destroyed where an employer is on notice that the defamatory statements are of questionable validity and yet, with reckless disregard for the truth, fails to adequately investigate their veracity. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>A.B.C. Needlecraft Co. v. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc.,</i> 245 F.2d 775, 777 (2d Cir.1957) (holding that evidence was sufficient to warrant submission of the case to the jury as to whether privilege had been abused when defendant's defamatory statement was based on a \"misunderstood casual remark, with no effort to verify facts, though to have done so would have been a simple matter\"); <i>Torosyan v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharm., Inc.,</i> 234 Conn. 1, 662 A.2d 89, 104 (1995) (conditional privilege destroyed where defendants \"failed to investigate or retract the statement even after the plaintiff notified them that the statement was false and requested further review\"); <i>Wirig v. Kinney Shoe Corp.,</i> 461 N.W.2d 374, 380-81 (Minn.1990) (conditional privilege destroyed where \"an employer . . . takes no steps to investigate but relies entirely on accusations either made by employees who may be biased or on second-hand hearsay with no identification of sources\"); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 600 (1977) (conditional privilege fails if statement made with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard as to its truth).</p>\n<p>In this case, the ten defamatory statements made by FedEx were clearly within the scope of the conditional privilege as communications regarding the discharge of an employee. The jury made this finding on the special verdict form, and it has not been challenged on appeal. FedEx contends, however, that Soto did not meet his burden of demonstrating that FedEx had abused the privilege. FedEx cites <i>Cabrero Muñiz v. Zayas Seijo,</i> 2006 WL 1313775 (P.R.2006),<sup>[20]</sup> for the proposition that \"bad investigation allows an inference [of] real malice only in exceptional circumstances and with the benefit of other evidence tending to show such malice.\" That case concerned the \"actual malice\" requirement in the context of defamation of a public figure, not an inquiry into abuse of the conditional privilege. However, even if we were to conclude that the same standard applies to determine \"improper motive\" in the privilege inquiry, the jury was entitled to infer that the circumstances here were sufficiently exceptional to allow liability to attach.</p>\n<p>The jury heard evidence from which it could reasonably conclude that FedEx was on notice of the questionable validity of the cocaine allegations as early as June 6, when Soto called Pérez and Medina to report that Iris Romero had received the package without incident. FedEx insisted at trial that Soto was dismissed for his violation of the employee shipping policy, not for shipping drugs. As a result, no investigation of the drug allegations was required. However, regardless of the reasons behind the dismissal, once FedEx was on notice that the drug allegations were questionable, it was obligated to either stop repeating them or adequately investigate them. It did neither. As a result, the jury was entitled to conclude that FedEx had \"improper motives\" and thereby lost the benefit of the conditional privilege because it acted with reckless disregard for the truth.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> 4. Sufficiency of Evidence on Actual Harm</h2>\n<p>FedEx also asserts that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the libel claim because Soto failed to prove that he suffered emotional distress as a result of the publication of the libelous statements, rather than merely as a result of reading those statements himself. We reject this assertion. The jury could have reasonably inferred that Soto's reputation within FedEx was harmed by the connection between his name and the drug allegations. <i>See </i><i>Porto,</i> 132 D.P.R. 331 (\"[C]orporate employees are only too human and when they learn of a defamatory statement the reputation of the affected employee is clearly demeaned in the workplace.\"). Moreover, Soto did present evidence about the shame and humiliation he experienced as a direct result of knowing that the drug allegations were circulating among FedEx management. He explained, for example, that when he received the letter from Senior Vice President Colomba: \"[L]ife came to an end for me because having a V.P. of the company state that I had sent drugs, cocaine. . . . My world came to an end, fell on me.\" No more is required to sustain the jury's finding of liability on the libel claim. <i>See </i><i>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,</i> 418 U.S. 323, 350, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974) (describing \"customary types of actual harm inflicted by defamatory falsehood [to] include impairment of reputation and standing in the community, personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering\"); <i>Fiori v. Truck Drivers, Local 170,</i> 354 F.3d 84, 87 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that \"emotional distress need be no more than `outrage' and `anger' upon seeing the libelous statements, since mental distress is the `natural result' of libel\" (quoting <i>Shafir v. Steele,</i> 431 Mass. 365, 727 N.E.2d 1140, 1146 (2000))). Accordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of FedEx's motion for judgment as a matter of law on that claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>In addition to its sufficiency challenges, FedEx contends that the district court improperly admitted damage testimony that was not causally linked to any issue in the case and that this evidence improperly inflated the jury's damage award. In reviewing an allegation of evidentiary error, we must consider first whether the district court erred and then whether this error was harmful. <i>Ahern v. Scholz,</i> 85 F.3d 774, 786 (1st Cir.1996). \"A trial court's error in an evidentiary ruling only rises to the level of harmful error if a party's substantial right is affected.\" <i>Id.</i> To determine whether a substantial right is implicated, we examine \"the centrality of the evidence and the prejudicial effect of its . . . inclusion.\" <i>Id.</i> Given our disposition of the slander and IIED claims, we consider only whether the admission of the damage evidence was prejudicial error that tainted the award on the surviving libel claim.</p>\n<p>Over FedEx's objections, the district court allowed Soto to testify extensively about emotional damages he suffered as a result of the financial difficulties his family encountered after he lost his job at FedEx. For example, he testified: \"We don't have as much time as we had before to share. . . . I work more. [My wife] has had to take on providing, giving tutoring services because she is a teacher. So, she gets home from school and sometimes when I get home from work she is still dealing with Martin. Martin is my young boy and my intimate life was also affected.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> More specifically, Soto's counsel asked what problems he confronted \"after the situation with FedEx with respect\" to the child support payment he owed for another child who lived with his ex-wife, Janet. He replied:</p>\n<blockquote>Well, since they would take it from my salary check, I had problems with the Family Department which is the one that has to do with child support. I talked with Janet. She is Ricardo's mother. I told her that I had been fired from Federal Express; that I had to take the steps to get another job in order to be able to pay for the child support; that I could not send him the same amount because I didn't know what my salary was going to be. She understood it but since the payment was not reaching the Family Department, well, I was summoned. I was summoned. I asked Janet to write a letter stating that I had sent her the money and she behaved very good with me and so then I submitted it to the judge who was presiding over the case. He lowered the sum. . . .</blockquote>\n<p>Soto's counsel then asked how the situation with the child support made Soto feel. He responded: \"It made me feel very bad because besides the fact that I would always pay and it would be deducted from my salary, I always made sure that Ricardo wasn't needing anything.\"</p>\n<p>Soto also testified about his family's need to cancel a vacation in Florida as a result of his termination:</p>\n<blockquote>I first told my wife's relatives, family in Orlando because they were expecting us to go there on vacation. So, we had to cancel vacations because one of the benefits employees had with FedEx was that we could buy discount[ed] air fare. We had discount air fare to buy tickets and the manager has to authorize you so you can purchase the ticket and that is when the suspension came up and then termination but by then they were all expecting us. They are all over there and so then after step one [of the GFTP review] we called Lisa's family and told them about the tragedy.</blockquote>\n<p>Soto testified that after his termination he obtained positions at Caribbean Products and then DHL through connections with family and former co-workers. When Soto was laid-off from DHL, his supervisor there recommended him for a position at Advance, where he worked at the time of trial. At FedEx he made $17.45 per hour, at DHL he started at $9.75, and he was earning less than that at Advanced at the time of the trial. A. 1116. Soto's counsel asked how these lower earnings affected him emotionally. He replied: \"Well, right now I depend on my wife to be able to pay things for the house. I feel impotent because of what I cannot do now. Before I used to be the head of the household and now sometimes I have to go to my father-in-law to ask him for help and I do it now very embarrassed because I never did that before.\"<sup>[22]</sup></p>\n<p>There was never any testimony, however, establishing that Caribbean Products, DHL, or Advanced ever saw the libelous statements published by FedEx. There was no testimony that Soto's subsequent employers' knowledge of his termination at FedEx adversely impacted his job placement or pay. There was no testimony that he was not hired at any other company to which he applied as a result of the events at FedEx.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> Soto's financial struggles and the emotional turmoil they caused have no causal connection to the libel claim. Instead, the emotional distress Soto described is causally related only to the <i>fact</i> of termination and thus is evidence only of the damages suffered by Soto as a result of the wrongful termination itself. These damages were not properly before the jury because, as we have explained, such damages are compensable only pursuant to Act 80, which specifies a statutorily calculated damage award based on an employee's salary and years of service. That statute does not permit the recovery of emotional distress damages for a wrongful termination.</p>\n<p>Soto's testimony regarding the emotional suffering he endured as a result of his economic struggles would have been admissible and relevant to prove Soto's damages if he had supplied a causal link between his economic hardships and the defamatory statements made by FedEx. For example, Soto might have introduced evidence that, after his termination by FedEx, a prospective employer heard the drug allegations and, as result, refused to offer him a job. However, such a causal link was never established here.<sup>[23]</sup> Soto did not introduce any evidence suggesting that a subsequent employer or potential employer treated Soto adversely as a result of the defamatory statements made by FedEx. Indeed, Soto failed to show that those statements were ever published to anyone outside of FedEx. In the absence of such evidence, the powerful testimony regarding Soto's struggle to pay his child support, his wife's need to take on more tutoring, their need to cancel their vacation to Florida, and their need to rely financially on Rosario's father was legally irrelevant to any issue properly before the jury.<sup>[24]</sup> Thus, we conclude that the district court erred in admitting this testimony.</p>\n<p>We are also convinced that the evidentiary error was not harmless. The district court did instruct the jury that, with regard to damages for defamation, \"any award you choose to make to compensate the Plaintiff may only be to redress the consequences which followed from the injury to the Plaintiff's reputation,\" and that \"Plaintiffs cannot recover emotional damages that arise as a result of the mere fact that Soto Lébron's employment was terminated.\" However, the erroneously admitted evidence was the most emotionally compelling and specific damage evidence Soto presented. It would have been nearly impossible for the jury to ignore the harsh consequences to Soto and his family stemming from his wrongful termination.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the size of the $3 million libel award confirms that impossibility. In its remittitur decision, the district court summarized the damage evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Plaintiffs presented a picture of a forty-six year old father of two who, after a successful fourteen-year tenure at Federal Express, was faced with a false <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> accusation that he had mailed drugs and had to endure the fact that such accusation was reproduced in several written communications between his supervisors and other members of Defendant's management team. Furthermore, Plaintiffs emphasized the distress attendant to Co-plaintiff Soto's interview with Defendant's security specialist and his subsequent physical ouster of the company's premises. Plaintiff's evidence showed that Co-plaintiff Soto was distraught, humiliated, even with regards to his family, had trouble sleeping and suffered from anxiety, was generally unhappy and lost interest in his former pastimes. Plaintiffs' evidence also demonstrated that Co-plaintiff Soto was affected to such a degree that he had to seek out mental health services and take medication.</blockquote>\n<p>This summary does not distinguish between the emotional damages properly attributable to the libel claim and those related only to the economic damages caused by the termination. This same failure to distinguish by the jury affected a $3 million libel award that was grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the damages causally related to the libel.</p>\n<p>Emotional damages, though difficult to quantify, are not immune from appellate review. <i>Koster v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</i> 181 F.3d 24, 34-35 (1st Cir.1999). Here, the evidence reveals that Soto was not disabled  either permanently or temporarily  by his emotional distress. He was able to find a new job and continue working within his field. Moreover, he did not introduce any medical evidence to prove the severity of his distress. <i>Id.</i> at 35 (\"[A]lthough emotional damages are warranted even without medical or psychiatric evidence, the lack of such evidence is relevant to the amount of award.\"). Thus, given the enormous size of the award here, it appears that the erroneously admitted damage evidence tainted the verdict by leading the jury to compensate Soto not only for the emotional damages stemming from the defamation but also for the emotional distress he suffered as a result of his economic woes following the termination.</p>\n<p>The prejudicial effect of the erroneously admitted evidence could have been removed by a sufficient remittitur. However, the remitted $1.8 million award remains far beyond the damages supported by Soto's properly admitted, causally valid damage evidence. <i>See </i><i>Sanchez v. Puerto Rico Oil Co.,</i> 37 F.3d 712, 724 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that a remitted award may be overturned if \"the reduced figure remains so extravagant as to shock the appellate conscience.\"); <i>Wagenmann v. Adams,</i> 829 F.2d 196, 215 (1st Cir.1987) (reviewing a remitted verdict to determine whether the appellant has shown that \"the reduced sums remain so exorbitant, so disturbing to our collective conscience, as to entitle [it] to [a] new trial[ ]\").</p>\n<p>The two cases cited by the district court in support of its remittitur suggest that the remitted award should have been far lower. First, the district court cited <i>Shaffer v. State of Ariz. Citizens Clean Election Comm'n,</i> No. 03CV2344PHXFJM, 2006 WL 155880, at *3 (D.Ariz. Jan.19, 2006), noting that the judge there had reduced the damages on a defamation claim by 40% \"because the jury took into account damages stemming from plaintiff's termination.\" This characterization of <i>Shaffer</i> suggests that the district court in Soto's case may have been aware of the causation problems in the damage testimony. However, the <i>Shaffer</i> case itself illustrates why the district court's remittitur here was insufficient to cure the evidentiary error.</p>\n<p>In <i>Shaffer,</i> a government employee had been wrongfully accused of felony fraud by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> his employer and the accusation was released to the media and appeared in the news. The district court reduced the $1.1 million damages award to $660,000. Unlike Soto, Shaffer's prospective employers had been exposed to the defamatory statements through the media. <i>Id.</i> at *2. However, the trial court noted that Shaffer, like Soto, had \"failed to produce any evidence that prospective employers considered the defamatory statement in rejecting Shaffer's employment applications.\" <i>Id.</i> at *3. The <i>Shaffer</i> court also noted a causation problem within the damage award: \"Moreover, it is equally plausible that Shaffer's difficulty in finding employment following his termination arose substantially from the fact that he was dismissed from his prior position. Similarly, his emotional and reputation difficulties logically arose in part from his termination.\" <i>Id.</i> In Soto's case, where there was no evidence that any prospective employer was exposed to the defamatory statements, it is not merely \"equally plausible\" that his economic difficulties, and the emotional distress they caused, were unrelated to the defamatory statements. It is, in fact, the only reasonable inference. Nonetheless, Soto's remitted verdict remains nearly three times larger than the remitted verdict in <i>Shaffer.</i></p>\n<p>The second case cited by the district court, <i>McCann v. Ruiz,</i> 802 F.Supp. 606 (D.P.R.1992), similarly does not support the $1.8 million remitted award. In that case, the court observed that the plaintiff had \"suffered a mild form of depression and was concerned about his future and the future of his family\" as a result of his employer's defamatory statements. <i>Id.</i> at 616. However, noting that the plaintiff's suffering \"apparently did not require treatment nor . . . result in any permanent injury,\" the district court found the jury's award of $255,000 to be \"grossly excessive\" and ordered a remitted award of $100,000. <i>Id.</i> Soto arguably suffered a marginally more severe injury than McCann because he sought treatment from a psychiatrist. However, that distinction between the cases cannot support the enormous variance between the size of Soto's award and the award in <i>McCann.</i></p>\n<p>The remittitur in <i>Budet-Correa v. United Parcel Service,</i> 322 F.Supp.2d 139 (D.P.R.2004), provides another pertinent point of comparison. In that case, the court reduced a jury award of $825,000 in emotional distress damages to an employee of UPS who was accused of attempted murder and received a death threat from a security officer hired by the company to surveil him.<sup>[25]</sup> The plaintiff in that case introduced testimony from his treating psychologist to establish that he had an anxiety disorder. He also introduced evidence that he had been declared disabled and received Social Security disability benefits as a result of the psychological injury attributable to UPS's conduct. Despite this evidence, the court concluded that the jury award was \"grossly disproportionate to the injuries established by the evidence\" and reduced the award to $250,000. <i>Id.</i> at 142. Soto's damage evidence did not include any expert psychological testimony and did not come close to establishing that he was disabled by his emotional injury. Given these comparisons, the $1.8 million award here remains shockingly exorbitant.</p>\n<p>The district court's task was to determine the <i>maximum dollar amount</i> that is supported by the evidence. <i>Conjugal P'ship Comprised by </i><i>Joseph Jones &amp; Verneta G. Jones v. Conjugal P'ship Comprised</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> <i>by Arthur Pineda &amp; Toni Pineda,</i> 22 F.3d 391, 398 (1st Cir.1994). The <i>Shaffer, McCann,</i> and <i>Budet-Correa</i> cases do not support the district court's determination of that maximum dollar amount here. If Shaffer's $1.1 million jury award, McCann's $255,000 award, and Budet-Correa's $825,000 award were each grossly excessive, they cannot help to explain why a $1.8 million award in Soto's case is appropriate.<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p>This is not a case where we are merely second-guessing the amount of the district court's remittitur. <i>See </i><i>Sanchez,</i> 37 F.3d at 724 (noting that when the district court has already ordered a remittitur, the appellate court's review of the remaining award is permissible, but quite constrained). Here, there is an identifiable legal error that is at the heart of the jury's inflated award.<sup>[27]</sup> We cannot discern from the court's remittitur decision whether an awareness of this legal error may have been a factor in that decision. In any case, the district court's remittitur was insufficient to correct the legal error in admitting the causally flawed damage testimony. Accordingly, we conclude that the damage award has been prejudicially tainted and must be vacated.<sup>[28]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> We also conclude that our decision to vacate the damage award for libel does not require us to vacate the liability finding as well. The district court used a detailed special verdict form, and appropriate instructions, that required the jury to keep its liability determination separate from its valuation of the damages. Thus, we conclude that the evidentiary error that skewed the damage award here did not taint the finding of liability for libel. That finding was, as we describe above, amply supported by admissible evidence. Moreover, we are confident that the damage issue is \"`so distinct and separable from the other issues that a trial of [that] issue[ ] alone may be had without injustice.'\" <i>La Plante v. Am. Honda Motor Co.,</i> 27 F.3d 731, 738 (1st Cir.1994); <i>Mandel v. Boston Phoenix, Inc.,</i> 456 F.3d 198, 210 (1st Cir.2006) (\"In the final analysis, then, the scope of a remand is normally a judgment call for the appellate court.\"). As a result, the damages may be retried as the sole issue on remand. The newly constituted jury will be able to evaluate Soto's damages after hearing only the evidence that is causally related to the libel claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p>Although FedEx has prevailed on most of its appellate issues, its happiness with that outcome should be muted. The company's termination of Soto's employment was handled badly, even though Soto himself bears some responsibility for his predicament because of his violation of the company's employee shipping policy. Still, for reasons that remain murky, FedEx never secured the lab report, completed while the review of Soto's termination was still underway, which demonstrates that the suspicious substance in the package that Soto shipped was not liquid cocaine. This failure to secure that exculpatory drug report cost Soto his job and caused much of the misery for the Soto family that followed. Even though the jury's evaluation of this sad story cannot withstand appellate review for the reasons cited herein, FedEx should understand that judgment of the jury for what it was  a sharp rebuke for the company's handling of Soto's termination.</p>\n<p>In summary, we affirm the district court's grant of FedEx's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the slander claim. We reverse the district court's denial of FedEx's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the IIED claim. We affirm the district court's denial of FedEx's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the libel claim, but vacate the damage awards for both Soto and Rosario on the libel claim. We remand for a new trial on damages relating to the libel claim. Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The complaint also named the conjugal partnership comprised of Soto and Rosario as a co-plaintiff.</p>\n<p>[2]  Because Rosario's claim is derivative, we refer to Soto, at times, as if he were the sole plaintiff.</p>\n<p>[3]  Section 7-35 of FedEx's \"People Manual\" states: \"FedEx Express offers FedEx Express employees . . . reduced rates for personal shipping.\" The \"Employee Eligibility\" portion of the policy states that \"[t]his policy intends to offer discount shipping through the FedEx Express system to eligible employees and members of their immediate families (spouse or dependent children) as an employee benefit.\" Soto acknowledged receipt of this policy by signing a memorandum, dated August 30, 2001, that warned him that \"[a]ny abuse of this benefit may result in termination.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  Soto consented to having the security interview tape recorded, but FedEx never produced the tape during discovery, reporting it lost. Accordingly, the court gave the jury a spoliation instruction, permitting the jury to draw an adverse inference from the disappearance of the tape. The facts recited herein represent Soto's description of the security interview.</p>\n<p>[5]  The record does not reveal what \"Becton and Dickinson\" is or why FedEx security personnel used this name for the lab.</p>\n<p>[6]  It appears that Pérez obtained this information from his supervisor, who had received it from FedEx security personnel in Florida.</p>\n<p>[7]  Both Iris Romero and her daughter testified that the package had been delivered by a FedEx truck on June 4. The package was shown to the jury. Iris testified that one of the bottles, the hair relaxer, was not in its original package (\"it had been taken out and place[d] in a ziplock bag\"). No one from any law enforcement agency ever contacted Iris or Soto regarding the package.</p>\n<p>[8]  FedEx challenges this evidentiary ruling on several grounds. However, we perceive no abuse of discretion in the district court's decision.</p>\n<p>[9]  This appears to be a reference to Pérez, the security specialist who had first interviewed Soto.</p>\n<p>[10]  The official translations of many of the Puerto Rico cases cited herein do not contain internal page numbers. Accordingly, we cannot include pin-point citation references for those cases.</p>\n<p>[11]  This case is not available in English translation in Westlaw's database. We have relied on the slip version of the official translation.</p>\n<p>[12]  The jury could have found liability for wrongful termination either by concluding that the termination was at least partially motivated by the unfounded drug allegations or by concluding that a single violation of the employee shipping policy would not be good cause for termination unless the package actually contained cocaine. Either way, FedEx's inadequate investigation of the drug allegations is implicated in the wrongful termination verdict.</p>\n<p>[13]  Soto presented claims for both slander and libel at trial. The two causes of action differ only in that the slander claim is founded on oral statements, which allegedly accounted for the widespread rumors of Soto's involvement with drugs, while the libel claim is founded on written statements.</p>\n<p>[14]  Soto's brief states that \"the IIED claim revolves around facts that are separate and distinct from the defamation claim and involve different injuries.\" Although other portions of the brief appear to marshal the defamatory conduct in support of his IIED claim, this statement appears to be an acknowledgment that FedEx's defamatory actions cannot form the basis of Soto's IIED claim.</p>\n<p>[15]  Soto also argues that the \"mysterious\" disappearance of the audio tape of the security interview should be considered as one element in FedEx's egregious course of conduct. However, Soto was unaware that the tape had been lost until FedEx failed to produce it during discovery in this case. As such, its disappearance is not relevant conduct for the IIED inquiry. <i>See </i><i>Knussman v. Maryland,</i> 272 F.3d 625, 641 (4th Cir.2001) (\"Generally speaking, litigation-induced emotional distress is never a compensable element of damages.\").</p>\n<p>[16]  FedEx separately challenges whether this statement was ever published to any other person within FedEx. However, Operations Manager Calero's report dated June 11 explicitly refers to an investigation by Pérez. Thus, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to infer that Calero read Pérez's incident report in preparing his own report.</p>\n<p>[17]  Each of the GFTP memoranda circulated among FedEx management and human resources personnel who were participating in the GFTP review process.</p>\n<p>[18]  FedEx also claims that the district court erred in refusing to include a separate interrogatory as to each individual defamatory statement on the special verdict form. However, the district court did instruct the jury that it must consider each communication separately in making a determination regarding Soto's libel claim. The special verdict form here was already long and detailed. It was well within the district court's discretion to determine that the jury instruction was sufficient and that the special verdict form requested by FedEx was unnecessarily detailed. <i>See </i><i>Santos v. Posadas De P.R. Assocs., Inc.,</i> 452 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>[19]  FedEx asserts on appeal that plaintiffs were required to meet their burden on this issue with \"clear and convincing evidence.\" Puerto Rico has not adopted this standard and the jury was instructed, without objection, that the preponderance of the evidence standard applies. As such, the preponderance standard is the law of the case. <i>See </i><i>Rodriguez-Torres,</i> 399 F.3d at 58. FedEx also challenges the district court's refusal to instruct the jury that \"good faith is presumed.\" However, the court did instruct the jury that Soto bore the burden of establishing that FedEx abused its conditional privilege. No more was required.</p>\n<p>[20]  The English translation of this case is not available on Westlaw. We have relied on a certified slip translation.</p>\n<p>[21]  The jury could also have reasonably concluded that, because FedEx had not adequately investigated the drug allegations, its frequent repetition of those allegations constituted \"excessive publication\" of the defamatory statements, resulting in loss of the conditional privilege. <i>See </i><i>Porto,</i> 132 D.P.R. 331 (noting \"excessive publication\" destroys the conditional privilege).</p>\n<p>[22]  Similar testimony was also offered by Rosario's father, who explained that he \"had to help them pay[] the studies of the little boy. . . at La Piedad School . . . [and also help pay for] some sports studies he was taking.\"</p>\n<p>[23]  The district court apparently believed that evidence linking the statements and Soto's financial difficulty would be introduced and ruled that this damage testimony could come in because Soto was entitled to show the emotional harm he suffered as a result of FedEx's defamatory statements reaching future employers. However, at the end of the trial, this causal link was still missing.</p>\n<p>[24]  Such evidence was also irrelevant to the IIED claim, even if that were a viable claim, because there was never any suggestion that FedEx's security interview or \"course of conduct\" rendered Soto so emotionally incapacitated as to make him unable to look for work, find work, or perform well on the job. Thus, there is nothing to link the financial hardships the family experienced following the termination to the allegedly outrageous conduct of FedEx.</p>\n<p>[25]  The theory of liability in <i>Budet-Correa</i> was intentional infliction of emotional distress (based upon the death threat by the security officer), rather than libel, but the case is nevertheless instructive as to the valuation of emotional damages.</p>\n<p>[26]  In searching for similar verdicts to guide our review of the level of emotional damages here, we follow the lead of the parties and the district court and consider cases from both Puerto Rico and other U.S. jurisdictions. These cases universally suggest that the $1.8 million dollar award is grossly excessive. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Whitfield v. Meléndez-Rivera,</i> 431 F.3d 1, 18 (1st Cir.2005) (reducing award from $500,000 to $100,000 for mother of plaintiff who was shot twice in the leg by police officers; mother testified that \"she was so distraught that she could not work for a month\"); <i>Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Mountain Home v. Globe Int'l Publ'g, Inc.,</i> 978 F.2d 1065, 1071 (8th Cir.1992) (jury verdict of $650,000 remanded for \"substantial remittitur\" where damage evidence was \"limited to testimony describing [the plaintiff] as angry, upset, humiliated, embarrassed, depressed and disturbed\"); <i>Rady v. Forest City Enters., Inc.,</i> 27 Ohio Misc.2d 36, 501 N.E.2d 688, 690 (Com.Pl.1986) (vacating a $1,000,000 compensatory award in a libel case where \"[p]laintiff's discharge and the underlying accusations were not disclosed to persons outside the immediate group composed of her supervisors and those responsible for hiring and firing\"). The cases cited by Soto in support of the $1.8 million award each involve the defamation of individuals who were prevented, by the defamation, from returning to work in their chosen fields. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Purgess v. Sharrock,</i> 33 F.3d 134 (2d Cir.1994) (upholding $3.5 million award, which appears to have encompassed both emotional distress and lost future wages, for anesthesiologist based on defamatory statements accusing him of malpractice and preventing him from finding work in a private hospital).</p>\n<p>[27]  In some cases, an appellate court that finds a jury's verdict to be grossly disproportionate to the injuries established by the evidence may order its own remittitur, setting the proper amount of the verdict without the need for a second trial on damages. <i>See</i> 11 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d</i> § 2820 (\"If the appellate court concludes that the verdict is excessive, it need not necessarily reverse and order a new trial. It may give plaintiff an alternative by ordering a new trial unless plaintiff will consent to a remittitur in a specified amount.\"); <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Koster,</i> 181 F.3d at 36 (concluding that \"the evidence of emotional distress would support a maximum recovery of emotional damages of $250,000\" and conditioning a new trial on damages on plaintiff's rejection of that lower amount); <i>Marchant v. Dayton Tire &amp; Rubber Co.,</i> 836 F.2d 695, 704 (1st Cir.1988) (setting remittitur at $300,000). In such cases, there is generally no identifiable legal error that accounts for the inflated award. In this case, where an identifiable evidentiary error directly affected the valuation of Soto's emotional distress, we conclude that our best course of action is to remand for a new trial rather than attempting to derive a maximum recovery amount from the flawed evidentiary record.</p>\n<p>[28]  Rosario's derivative award of $1 million was affected by the same evidentiary error and, additionally, includes damages for the emotional distress attributable to the now-vacated slander and IIED verdicts, and must also be vacated.</p>\n\n</div>",

Soto-Lebron (\"Soto\") and his wife, Elizabeth Rosario Domenech (\"Rosario\"), sued Soto's former employer, Federal Express Corporation (\"FedEx\"), following Soto's termination by the company for a violation of company rules.<sup>[1]</sup> The plaintiffs asserted emotional damages arising from libel, slander, and intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\").<sup>[2]</sup> Soto also claimed statutory damages for wrongful termination pursuant to P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29 §§ 185a-185m (\"Act <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> 80\"). The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs on all claims and awarded a total of $7,014,910.74 in damages. The district court then granted FedEx's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the slander claim and ordered a remittitur on the IIED and libel awards, reducing the total award to $4,014,910.74. FedEx appeals the sufficiency of the evidence to support the liability findings and the damage awards, except on the Act 80 claim. Soto cross-appeals the judgment as a matter of law on his slander claim.</p>\n<p>As we shall explain more fully below, FedEx badly mishandled the termination of Soto. It conducted a sloppy investigation of his alleged misconduct before firing him. There are grounds for the indignation that the jury apparently felt about the performance of the company. Nevertheless, any such indignation cannot overwhelm the legal rules that courts must apply to the claims of liability and the award of damages in a case such as this. Therefore, after a careful review of the record, we have concluded that Soto did not introduce sufficient evidence to establish FedEx's liability for slander and IIED, and hence we must vacate those jury verdicts. There was sufficient evidence to support liability for libel, and hence we affirm the jury's liability finding on that claim. However, we have concluded that the admission of irrelevant evidence tainted the jury's damage calculation and that taint was not cured by the remittitur. Accordingly, we remand for a new trial on damages on the libel claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Given the challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict. <i>Davignon v. Hodgson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203296\"><a href=\"/opinion/203296/davignon-v-hodgson/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span>, 96 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>On May 30, 2002, Soto, a fourteen-year employee of FedEx, shipped a package through FedEx to Kissimmee, Florida. Soto's wife, Rosario, a schoolteacher, had given it to him after packaging it in her classroom with fellow teacher Loyda Romero. Rosario asked Soto to send the box, which contained hair care products, to Iris Romero, Loyda's sister, in Florida. Soto shipped it using the FedEx employee discount policy, which permits employees and members of their immediate families to send packages at discounted rates.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Security Interview</h2>\n<p>When Soto arrived at work on June 6, 2002, he was told that security wanted to speak to him. He was taken to a conference room where Jose Pérez, a FedEx security specialist, was waiting for him.<sup>[4]</sup> Pérez said: \"Sit there. I am Jose Pérez from security.\" Throughout the interview Pérez remained seated, \"leaning back on the chair.\" Pérez told Soto that he \"had a problem.\" Pérez showed Soto the airway-bill <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> for the package Soto had shipped to Florida and asked him if he recognized the bill. Soto said that he \"had filled it out to send Iris Romero the package, the gift.\"</p>\n<p>Pérez then told Soto that \"there were problems with that package, that the package had been seized at the station where the package ended up.\" Soto asked what type of problem the package had, and Pérez responded that the package \"had controlled substances, drugs\" and that it \"had been retained\" by police. Soto told him \"that is impossible.\" Pérez responded by stating that \"they had evidence, that they had laboratory reports and police records that there were drugs there.\" Soto testified that Pérez \"had some papers on top of the conference room table and during interrogation he pull[ed] out a document from the documents he had there that he said were evidence of the drugs and he said `I have a lab test' and throughout the interview would show the document like this. . . . [H]e waived [sic] the document to me and put it away.\" Pérez continued \"asking [Soto] to tell the truth\" and repeating that \"they had evidence.\"</p>\n<p>Pérez said he had been a police officer. He said that he had \"left the police because he was not in agreement with the abuse of the police and to tell him the truth, that if [Soto] told him the truth, he would help [him].\" Soto testified that Pérez's tone of voice and demeanor during the interview were \"strong[,] . . . intimidating, with authority.\"</p>\n<p>After \"25 or 20 minutes\" of interrogation by Pérez, Pedro Contreras, another FedEx security specialist, entered the conference room and Pérez left. Soto described Contreras as \"more at ease, more peaceful than Pérez because Pérez was acting with authority.\" Soto explained that the substance of Contreras's questioning was the same as that of Pérez, but that Contreras's approach was \"quieter\" and \"calmer.\" Soto continued to deny that drugs had been in the package. The questioning by Contreras lasted \"about 20 minutes.\"</p>\n<p>Then, Pérez and Rolando Medina, the station manager, came into the room, and Pérez said, \"This guy has to be suspended because he sent drugs through the system.\" Medina left the room and returned with a letter of suspension, which Soto signed. The suspension letter indicated that an investigation would be conducted and advised Soto to contact his manager each morning. The letter also stated, \"[Y]our [sic] are not to contact any FedEx location or customers without management approval.\" At the end of the interview, Soto also prepared and signed a statement indicating that he had shipped the package on behalf of Loyda Romero as a favor and that he did not know the contents of the package.</p>\n<p>Following the security interview, Soto told the FedEx officials that he had to go back to his delivery truck to retrieve his belongings. Pérez said, \"You can't do that. Just stop right there.\" Instead, Pérez and Contreras retrieved Soto's belongings. Then another FedEx employee escorted Soto outside to the security check point where he got into his personal vehicle. As Soto was being escorted outside, he passed by an area where he would be able to see clients or customers of FedEx. He reported seeing one person in that area. Medina told Soto as he was being escorted outside that he should \"calm down, to be at ease, not do anything crazy.\"</p>\n<p>Soto explained that after the interrogation he \"was nervous, confused.\" He said: \"I was shaking. I could not swallow. I was not well. I was like crazy. I was like I was crazy.\" When he left FedEx, he was scared. He explained, \"I didn't know what I was going to do, where I was going to go and then thinking that I was going to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> be arrested because what I was told inside was that the package contained drugs.\" When he arrived home, he told his wife he had been suspended. He testified that \"[s]he got hysterical. She started crying, yelling and I tried to be strong and to calm her down but I wasn't [able] to do so because we were both in the same condition.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. FedEx Proceeds to Terminate Soto</h2>\n<p>Soon after Soto arrived home, he and Rosario called Iris Romero. Iris reported that she had received the package without incident. Soto and Rosario were relieved, concluding that there must have been a misunderstanding or a mistake. Soto immediately called Security Specialist Pérez to tell him that Iris had received the package. According to Soto's testimony, Pérez told him \"that the package was at the Federal Express station. That there was a test made by Becton and Dickinson<sup>[5]</sup> and that there was a police report.\"</p>\n<p>Because he perceived that Pérez did not believe him, Soto then called Medina, the FedEx station manager, to explain the situation. He gave Medina the telephone number for Iris and asked him to call her, but Medina did not call. Medina repeated what Pérez had said: that a lab test had been conducted by Becton and Dickinson and that there was a police report. He told Soto that the police had the package.</p>\n<p>Soto called in to FedEx every morning, as he had been instructed to do in his suspension letter. Each morning, he asked to speak to Medina and was instead transferred to Operations Manager Alberto Calero, Soto's immediate supervisor. Each morning, Calero responded that \"they were dealing with the case.\" On June 11, Calero prepared and filed a report stating: \"Investigation by Specialist Pérez revealed that on 5-30-02, Soto shipped [airwaybill number] for a friend of his wife, in violation of FedEx policy 7-35 [the employee reduced rate policy] as admitted by him during a taped recorded interview. Further investigation by the Orange County Sheriff Dept., Orlando, FL revealed that the package contained an undetermined amount of liquid cocaine. Soto was suspended and consequently terminated for the above violation.\"</p>\n<p>On June 13, Soto was told to come into the station at three in the afternoon. Soto was brought into a conference room where Calero gave him a termination letter. Soto testified:</p>\n<blockquote>Calero signs my letter of dismissal, of termination and he hadn't done any investigation so I asked him, \"Calero, why did you do this? You didn't do any investigation. Why are you doing this? What did you do with the information I gave Rolando Medina? Calero, why did you do this\" because he had told me that he hadn't done any investigation and if he didn't do any investigation, how can he sign the paper saying that an investigation had been done?</blockquote>\n<p>Calero responded that Soto \"was responsible for what [his] family did.\" Soto asked to speak to Pérez. Medina responded that he was not available. Soto said, \"[W]ell, he is not here because he [knows] that what he had accused me of was a lie because the package had been delivered and nothing had happened. There hadn't been any arrests. I had not been interrogated by any police officer.\"</p>\n<p>Soto's termination letter, dated June 13, 2002, stated: \"A thorough investigation of an alleged violation of the Employee reduced-rate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> Shipping Policy 7-35 has determined that you allowed your employee reduced rate privileges to be utilized to ship a package for an ineligible person. In addition, the shipment allowed an illegal substance to be transported through the system in further violation of FedEx policies.\"</p>\n<p>Soto's termination letter informed him that he could invoke review procedures under the FedEx \"Guaranteed Fair Treatment Procedure/EEO Complaint Process\" (\"GFTP\") by submitting a request for review. He did so in a written statement on June 17, asking the company to further investigate the allegation that the package contained drugs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. FedEx's Investigation into the Contents of the Package</h2>\n<p>At the time of the initial security interview, neither Pérez nor Contreras, the two security specialists, had a copy of a police report or a lab report identifying the contents of the package as illegal drugs. Pérez testified that, prior to questioning Soto, he had been briefed by Contreras, who told him that \"the package had been stopped by law enforcement in Orlando because allegedly it had a drug alert and they did some testing and whatever.\" Later the same day, Pérez sent an email to Medina, the station manager, stating that the package contained approximately one kilogram of cocaine. The email also stated that Pérez had made a call to investigate further and learned \"that not only was there a K-9 alert, a field test conducted but, the contents were analyzed by the FDLE (Florida Dept. of Law Enforcement).\"<sup>[6]</sup> Medina forwarded this email to his supervisor, Managing Director Roby Brown, and Maruchi Torres, the acting manager of human resources.</p>\n<p>Some time after the interview, Pérez also telephoned John Matlock, a FedEx security specialist assigned to Orlando, asking for further documentation regarding the incident. On June 13, Matlock faxed a copy of the incident report filed by the sheriff's office in Orange County, Florida to Pérez. The incident report, which was admitted at trial to show what FedEx knew  rather than for its truth  states that a K-9 alert identified the package as containing narcotics. The police officer then obtained a search warrant and opened the package. Inside, the officer found a \"30 cc syring [sic] bottle\" with a white substance in it. The officer stated that he did a \"field persumptive [sic] test\" on the substance and the \"test resulted positive for the presence of cocaine.\"</p>\n<p>It is now clear that the package Soto shipped did not have cocaine in it. At trial, the judge admitted a lab report indicating that the 30 cc bottle taken from Soto's package tested negative for cocaine.<sup>[7]</sup> The report, completed by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE), is dated June 25, 2002-twelve days after Soto's termination, but while the company's GFTP review of that decision was ongoing.</p>\n<p>When the plaintiffs sought to introduce the FDLE lab report into evidence during their case in chief, FedEx objected on the basis that there was nothing to link the report to Soto's package. The trial judge <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> observed that FedEx had the lab report throughout the lengthy discovery period in the case, and had filed numerous motions in limine as to other evidentiary concerns, but had never before raised the linkage issue. As a result, the trial judge allowed the plaintiffs time to request a document linking the lab report to the police officer's incident report and then allowed the plaintiffs to introduce that document, along with the lab report, as rebuttal evidence after one of FedEx's witnesses testified about the initial K-9 alert and field presumptive test.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>In sum, the evidence indicates that the package Soto shipped was stopped by law enforcement personnel after field testing indicated the presence of cocaine. A subsequent lab report revealed that the package contained no illicit drugs. There is no evidence to suggest that FedEx was aware of the existence of this lab report prior to the commencement of Soto's litigation. There is also no evidence to suggest that anyone at FedEx ever specifically asked for or tried to locate the FDLE lab test results at any time prior to the commencement of litigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. The GFTP Review Process</h2>\n<p>On June 18, Operations Manager Calero and Station Manager Medina each wrote memoranda explaining the management rationale for Soto's termination. Calero's memorandum stated: \"After reviewing the Security Investigation outcome it was determined, that Luis R. Soto sent a package for a friend of his wife using his FedEx Employee reduced rate-shipping discount. In addition, this violation of FedEx Policy allowed illegal substances to be shipped through the system.\" Medina's memorandum stated: \"Luis R. Soto admitted in a conversation with me and Security Specialist Jose Pérez, that in fact he shipped a package for a friend of his wife using his employee discount and that he was not aware of its contents. The airwaybill utilized had Luis Soto's name as the shipper. This violation of the Employee Reduced-Rate Shipping policy allowed an illegal substance to be transported through the FedEx system. Some other factors considered were; that if we allow this to happen based on the premises that the contents were not of the employees [sic] knowledge we will be establishing a precedent for future situations of this magnitude. The ultimate responsible [sic] for any shipment sent through the FedEx system is the shipper.\"</p>\n<p>On June 19, Soto met with Managing Director Brown, who gave him copies of the incident report prepared by the police in Florida and the search warrant for the package. Acting Managing Director of Human Resources Torres, Calero, and Medina were also present at the meeting. Two days later, Brown sent Soto a letter upholding the dismissal: \"A review . . . clearly demonstrates that you violated the Employee Reduced Rate Shipping Policy, (P7-35). It also should be noted that the violation of this policy allowed an illegal substance to be transported through the FedEx system, putting your fellow FedEx employees at risk.\"</p>\n<p>Soto initiated the second step of the GFTP process on June 27 with a letter to Julio Colomba, a FedEx Senior Vice President. He asked, \"Where is the lab report that indicates the presence of illegal substances?\" On July 8, John Matlock, the Orlando security specialist, sent an email to Jesus Rodriguez, a human resources person who was working on the investigation, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> summarizing the evidence he had about Soto's package:</p>\n<blockquote>The local Police Officer tested the contents and it tested positive. The cocaine was then removed from the pkg and then there was an attempt to deliver. There was no one home and the package was left at the door in an attempt to find the recpt. The pkg might have been delivered but it was not delivered with the cocaine in it. As far as the written results request, I sent the Security person<sup>[9]</sup> there the only written report from the police officer.</blockquote>\n<p>Colomba did not meet with Soto. Instead, he wrote a letter dated July 12, reaffirming the dismissal and once again stating: \"A review of this issue revealed that you shipped a package through the FedEx system containing an illegal drug (cocaine).\" Colomba's letter was copied to each of the personnel involved in the GFTP process (Brown, Medina, Calero and Rodrguez), as well as Juan Cento (Colomba's boss), Nelly Concepcion (Rodrguez's boss), and Suzanne Gaal (Concepcion's boss). Soto testified that when he received this letter, \"having a VP of the company state [that Soto] had sent drugs, cocaine,\" he felt as if \"[his] world came to an end, [and] fell on [him].\" The GFTP review was finalized with a letter on August 6, 2002. This letter did not state the reason for the termination or refer to illegal substances or any other negative information about Soto.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. The Plaintiffs' Emotional Distress</h2>\n<p>At trial, Soto testified that he had experienced \"[e]motional damages, anxiety,\" sleeping problems, and \"deep sadness\" following the events described above. He saw a psychiatrist ten times (the maximum his health insurance would allow) beginning in October 2002, and was prescribed various medications for anxiety and panic. He explained that he had sought psychiatric treatment because he wanted to feel like himself again: \"I mean that I was a happy man like every Puerto Rican. I wanted to be the heart of the party, to share with my buddies, play basketball and everything that Luis Soto entailed. I wasn't able to sleep. I would wake up every night at midnight. I didn't know what time it was but I couldn't sleep.\" He described himself as \"anxious always without being able to talk.\" When asked specifically about damage to his reputation, Soto testified: \"It was said that I had sent drugs in a package and to me that was stab and as of this date, it is still in the record, my record that I transported drugs through the system, illegal substances through the system.\"</p>\n<p>Rosario explained her own emotional distress as stemming from her guilt in having been the one who gave Soto the package and feeling \"impotent to do something to help him.\" She visited a psychiatrist a couple of times and took various antidepressant medications because she was \"in extreme anxiety, very nervous\" and \"had some panic attacks.\"</p>\n<p>The district court also admitted testimony that Soto's co-workers had heard rumors that he was being accused of shipping drugs through the system, and they conveyed those rumors back to Soto. Rosario described these rumors as \"devastating\" for their reputation. She described her husband as having been \"destroyed\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> by the knowledge that these rumors were circulating at FedEx.</p>\n<p>In response to FedEx's interrogatories during discovery, Soto stated that he was seeking damages only for emotional distress. He did not claim economic damages or produce documents that would have supported a claim for lost wages. Soto failed to supplement his answers to interrogatories after economic damages were discussed at various depositions. Accordingly, the court ruled that evidence of Soto's economic damages would be excluded under Fed.R.Civ.P. 37. However, the court permitted testimony regarding \"economic facts . . . to lay the groundwork or foundation for any emotional damages that this plaintiff may have suffered.\" As a result, Soto presented other damage evidence, discussed in more detail below, describing how his family struggled financially as a result of his termination from FedEx and the emotional toll those financial struggles took.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. The Verdict and Appeal</h2>\n<p>In submitting this case to the jury following a ten-day trial, the district court used a special verdict form that required the jury to make specific findings on the particular elements of each cause of action and separate damage awards for each claim on which it found liability. After finding liability as to all claims, the jury returned statutory damages of $14,910 for wrongful discharge, a $1,000,000 award for slander, a $3,000,000 award for libel, a $2,000,000 award for IIED, and a $1,000,000 award for Rosario on her derivative claim. In response to a motion for remittitur and judgment as a matter of law, the district court vacated the slander award, reduced the libel award to $1,800,000, and reduced the IIED award to $1,200,000. The district court did not reduce Rosario's $1,000,000 award, on the ground that FedEx did not argue that it should be remitted.</p>\n<p>FedEx appeals, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence as to liability for IIED and libel, as well as the amount of the damage award, and asserting several other errors, including an evidentiary error in the admission of certain testimony regarding Soto's emotional distress damages. Soto cross-appeals, urging us to reinstate the slander award.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We first consider the backdrop of Puerto Rico's modified at-will employment law, which plays a critical role in this case, and then turn to the issues on appeal. Puerto Rico has altered its at-will employment regime to provide for a statutory damage award when an employee without a fixed-term contract is terminated without good cause. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, §§ 185a-185m. Referred to as Act 80, this statute defines good cause for termination to include, inter alia, \"[t]he employee's repeated violations of the reasonable rules and regulations established for the operation of the establishment, provided a written copy thereof has been opportunely furnished to the employee.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 185b(c). Although the statutory language requires repeated violations, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has stated, and the jury in Soto's case was instructed, that an employer may be justified in terminating an employee after a single violation of the employer's rules if the offense is \"`of such [seriousness or] nature as to reveal an attitude or a character trait so dangerous to the peace and good order of the enterprise, that it would be imprudent to wait for a second offense to separate him from the enterprise.'\" <i>Delgado Zayas v. Hosp. Interamericano de Medicina Avanzada,</i> 137 D.P.R. 643, 1994 P.R.-Eng. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> 908,890 (P.R.1994)<sup>[10]</sup> (quoting <i>Secretario del Trabajo v. I.T.T.

Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></span>, 569-70 (P.R.1979)). The employer bears the burden of showing that the termination was for good cause. 29 P.R. Laws. Ann. tit. 29, § 185a.</p>\n<p>The statute provides a formula for calculating what amounts to mandatory \"severance pay\" for employees who are wrongfully terminated. <i>Id.</i> The formula provides that the employee is entitled to:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) The salary corresponding to two (2) months, as indemnity, if discharged within the first five (5) years of service; the salary corresponding to three (3) months if discharged after five (5) years and up to fifteen (15) years of service; the salary corresponding to six (6) months if discharged after (15) years of service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) An additional progressive compensation equal to one (1) week for each year of service, if discharged within the first five (5) years of service; to two (2) weeks for each year of service, if discharged after five (5) years and up to fifteen (15) years of service; to three (3) weeks for each year of service if discharged after fifteen (15) years of service.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> For Soto, this formula produced an award of $14,910.74.</p>\n<p>Act 80's damage formula provides the exclusive remedy for wrongful termination of at  will employees in Puerto Rico. <i>Porto v.

However, \"if other independent tortious actions concur with the discharge, the employer may be held liable for said conduct.\" <i>Porto,</i> 132 D.P.R. 331. Thus, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has allowed defamation claims to proceed alongside Act 80 claims, holding that an employer's defamatory actions can be considered independent of the discharge. <i>Acevedo Santiago v.

It argued that the drug allegations were not the cause of the termination; thus, it was not obliged to fully investigate them. Soto argued that the drug allegations were clearly part of FedEx's termination decision and, as a result, they should have been fully investigated. The jury evidently agreed, finding the company liable for wrongful termination.<sup>[12]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> The resulting $14,910.74 award is the only compensation available to Soto for his damages arising from the fact of termination. FedEx has not appealed that award.</p>\n<p>With this discussion as background, we turn to Soto's allegations that FedEx committed \"independent tortious actions\" that caused emotional harm separate from that caused by the discharge, namely his claims of slander, IIED, and libel.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>In assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational jury could find in favor of the party who prevailed. <i>Gillespie v.

Cross-Appeal on Slander Award</h2>\n<p>The district court determined that FedEx was entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to the slander claim because Soto had failed to link rumors regarding the cause of his termination to a FedEx employee acting within the scope of his employment. We agree.</p>\n<p>To establish his slander claim, Soto bore the burden of proving that a FedEx employee, acting within the scope of his employment, transmitted a false and defamatory statement to another person, and that this transmission was negligent  as opposed to merely accidental  and non-privileged.<sup>[13]</sup><i>Corrada Betances v.

Circumstantial evidence may be used to prove that it was the defendant who made a particular  allegedly defamatory  statement. <i>See </i><i>Riisna v. Am. Broad.

Sack, <i>Sack on Defamation</i> § 2.5.1, at *2-85 (Mar.2007) (\"[I]t has been said that circumstantial evidence may be used to establish that the <i>defendant</i> published the allegedly defamatory words. That is not to say, however, that the <i>content</i> of an allegedly defamatory statement can be proven purely through hearsay.\").</p>\n<p>Soto introduced evidence that rumors regarding the reasons for his suspension and dismissal circulated widely among FedEx employees. He testified that he did not tell anyone at FedEx what had happened. Nonetheless, soon after he was suspended, he received inquiries from his coworkers, asking whether it was true that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> he had been suspended because his wife had given him a package containing drugs.</p>\n<p>Soto also introduced testimony that FedEx kept personnel files strictly confidential. One witness testified that, based on his fourteen years with the company, leaked information about an employee could only come from management. However, that same witness also testified that no member of management had told him anything about the reasons for Soto's suspension.</p>\n<p>Soto argues that the evidence that the rumors did not come from Soto himself, and that only management would have had access to the information, allowed the jury to make a reasonable inference that FedEx management personnel were the source of the rumors. However, even if it were logical to infer, as Soto argues, that someone in FedEx management must have said something to someone to start the rumors, that inference falls far short of proving each of the elements of slander. <i>See </i><i>Riisna,</i> 219 F.Supp.2d at 575 (\"There are too many links between any statement by [the defendant], if any there were, and whatever came back to plaintiff or her informants to permit a rational inference that whatever the plaintiff or her informants heard was what [the defendant] said.\"). Soto's circumstantial evidence that the rumors originated with management does not establish whether management personnel spoke negligently, rather than being accidentally overheard. Soto also did not establish that the statements that sparked the rumors were false. For example, management could have stated that Soto's package was stopped by officials after a K-9 alert for drugs. That statement is true and could not be grounds for a slander claim, though it could well have sparked the rumors.</p>\n<p>In sum, the evidence introduced in support of the slander claim \"does not rise to more than informal rumors\" circulating among employees, for which FedEx cannot be held liable. <i>See Corrada Betances,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">33687211</span></span>, at *5. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's judgment as a matter of law in favor of FedEx on this claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</h2>\n<p>Under Puerto Rico law, the elements of a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress are: 1) that the defendant engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct; 2) that such conduct was intended to cause the plaintiff severe emotional distress, or was done with reckless disregard for the plaintiff's emotional state; 3) that the plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress; and 4) that the severe distress is causally related to the extreme and outrageous conduct. <i>Santiago-Ramirez v.

A comment to the Restatement explains that the plaintiff has a heavy burden in proving that the defendant's conduct has been sufficiently offensive to permit a finding of liability:</p>\n<blockquote>It has not been enough that the defendant has acted with an intent which is tortious or even criminal, or that he has intended to inflict emotional distress, or even that his conduct has been characterized by \"malice,\" or a degree of aggravation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> which would entitle the plaintiff to punitive damages for another tort. Liability has been found only where the conduct has been so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community. Generally, the case is one in which the recitation of the facts to an average member of the community would arouse his resentment against the actor, and lead him to exclaim, \"Outrageous!\"</blockquote>\n<p>Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46 cmt. d; <i>see also </i><i>Thorpe v.

We address each in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Allegations That Soto Shipped Drugs</h2>\n<p>It is now clear that Soto was accused by FedEx, repeatedly and in writing, of doing something that he did not do: shipping, or allowing someone else to ship, drugs through the FedEx system. Those were egregiously false accusations. Those accusations are precisely the basis of his libel claim. Such a claim cannot be brought in the guise of an IIED claim, which would divorce it from the well developed law of defamation with its attendant privileges and defenses. <i>See </i><i>Demas v.

Soto seeks to avoid the impact of this jury instruction by asserting that it is the <i>repetition</i> of the defamatory statements that amounts to the \"extreme <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> and outrageous conduct\" here. However, the repetition of the statements is properly analyzed in the context of an abuse of an employer's conditional privilege to speak about an employee. <i>See </i><i>Porto,</i> 132 D.P.R. 331 (describing the elements of conditional privilege). Accordingly, to the extent that Soto's IIED claim is predicated on defamatory statements, the conduct must be considered under the framework of Soto's libel claim, which we address below, and cannot, as a matter of law, satisfy the \"extreme and outrageous conduct\" requirement of the IIED claim.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The Security Interview</h2>\n<p>Soto also points to the security interview as \"extreme and outrageous\" conduct by FedEx. As we noted above, courts have afforded employers \"some latitude in investigating possible employee misconduct.\" <i>Santiago-Ramirez,</i> 62 F.3d at 448 (citing <i>Starr v. Pearle Vision, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696246\"><a href=\"/opinion/696246/jacqui-starr-v-pearle-vision-inc-doing-business-as-pearle-vision/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1548</span></a></span>, 1558 (10th Cir.1995))(applying Puerto Rico law); <i>Camacho,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2644959</span></span> at *7 (applying Puerto Rico law).</p>\n<p>In <i>Santiago-Ramirez,</i> we addressed circumstances remarkably similar to the security interview conducted in Soto's case:</p>\n<blockquote>Appellant, Santiago, worked as a cashier at Fort Buchanan's Army Post Exchange Store. The store's policy prohibited employees from carrying merchandise through the front door. On June 29, 1990, Santiago and a co-employee violated this policy when they removed bags containing store merchandise through the front entrance. They placed these bags in the trunk of the co-employee's car. Unbeknownst to Santiago, the bags contained stolen merchandise. The Safety and Security Manager and Santiago's supervisor questioned her for a total of 45 minutes concerning this breach of store policy. Santiago told them that she did not know that the merchandise was stolen but was aware of the store's regulation that prohibited employees from carrying merchandise through the front door. She was later terminated for violating this regulation.</blockquote>\n<p>62 F.3d at 446. During the security interview, Santiago \"was shown a videotape supposedly taken at the store where she worked\" and \"told that if she did not cooperate with the investigation `all of this could be taken to the F.B.I.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 448. We held that \"[b]ecause this questioning was a necessary incident of employment for an employee who had broken the rules, under Puerto Rican law it cannot be said to be intentionally tortious.\" <i>Id.</i> In analyzing Santiago's claim, we drew an analogy to <i>Starr,</i> a Tenth Circuit case which held that \"a plaintiff's allegations that her employer yelled at her, pushed her back down into her chair, touched her arm and blocked her exit from the room during questioning, did not rise to the level of outrageousness required to state a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\" <i>Santiago-Ramirez,</i> 62 F.3d at 448 (describing the holding in <i>Starr,</i> 54 F.3d at 1558).</p>\n<p>Contrasting the facts in <i>Starr</i> and <i>Santiago-Ramirez</i> with those in <i>Kaminski v. United Parcel Service,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.D.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">871</span></span> (N.Y.App.Div.1986), a case cited by the plaintiffs, is instructive in evaluating when an employer's interrogation of an employee suspected of violating company rules crosses over the line into <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> \"outrageous and extreme conduct.\" In <i>Kaminski,</i> UPS security personnel accused the plaintiff, a UPS driver, of \"not having reported the receipt of a cash payment for a package.\" 501 N.Y.S.2d at 872. The plaintiff denied the charge. The security personnel told the plaintiff that he had been identified as the thief by two eyewitnesses. \"They then allegedly began to threaten him with a criminal prosecution and a prison term at Riker's Island if plaintiff did not admit stealing the money, agree to return the money, resign, and waive his rights to all health, hospital and pension benefits.\" <i>Id.</i> The plaintiff alleged that \"for three hours he was subjected to these threats which were accompanied by loud, aggressive, profane and obscene language and gestures.\" <i>Id.</i> He claimed that \"[a]t all times one or another of the defendants was blocking the door to the office.\" <i>Id.</i> Finally, he claimed that after three hours of this ordeal, \"under duress and still denying the accusation, [he] signed resignation papers and documents relinquishing his pension plan and health and hospital benefits and statements admitting his guilt.\" <i>Id.</i> On these facts, the court permitted the employee's IIED claim to survive a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>Comparing the facts in Soto's case with the facts in these three cases leads us to the conclusion that, as a matter of law, the security interview conducted by FedEx does not constitute \"outrageous and extreme conduct.\" The interview established that Soto had used his employee discount to ship a package for his wife's friend without knowledge of its contents in violation of FedEx's policy. The questioning lasted approximately 40-45 minutes, comparable in length to the questioning in <i>Santiago-Ramirez.</i> There was no evidence of any physical intimidation, blocking of the exits, or pushing. Unlike in <i>Kaminski,</i> Security Specialist Pérez did not threaten Soto with a prison sentence, pressure him into resigning and relinquishing his pension plan benefits, or make any other verbal threats. Under these circumstances, it is more accurate to characterize the security interview of Soto as a \"necessary incident of employment for an employee who had broken the rules.\" <i>See </i><i>Santiago-Ramirez,</i> 62 F.3d at 449.</p>\n<p>The most egregious aspect of the interview was Pérez's statement that he had a lab report as he waived a piece of paper in front of Soto. Pérez was, of course, bluffing. He did not have a copy of any document other than the airwaybill at the time of the security interview. However, Pérez had been told by his supervisors that the package was intercepted by police in Florida and had tested positive for cocaine. Under these circumstances, his bluff could not reasonably be considered \"beyond all possible bounds of decency.\"</p>\n<p>Soto also complains that he was \"summarily suspended and publicly escorted off FedEx premises.\" However, these actions are well within the latitude we afford employers investigating employee misconduct. The decision to remove him immediately and accompany him as he left the company property was a reasonable course of action in the face of the allegations against him. Thus, none of the conduct during or immediately following the security interview was \"extreme and outrageous.\"<sup>[15]</sup> It cannot support the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> 3. The Inadequate Investigation</h2>\n<p>Soto points to the inadequacy of the investigation as another aspect of FedEx's outrageous conduct: \"FedEx did little or nothing to obtain the facts, apparently preferring to avoid the truth in favor of a lie.\" The inadequacy of FedEx's investigation to support the allegation that Soto's package contained drugs is unmistakable, and that inadequacy remains a troubling aspect of this case. Soto emphasized that inadequacy as a key element of his argument that FedEx's termination of him was wrongful and, as we describe below, that FedEx had abused its conditional privilege to publish statements about an employee. However, the inadequate investigation is not conduct on the part of FedEx that caused harm to Soto independent of the harms caused by the termination itself and the publication of the libelous statements. The harm arising from the termination is, as we explained above, compensable <i>only</i> under Act 80, and cannot factor into our analysis of IIED. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 185a; <i>Vélez Rodriguez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> 135 D.P.R. 500, 1994 P.R.-Eng. 909576 (P.R.1994) (\"The compensation provided by law is the exclusive remedy for unjust discharge.\"). Similarly, Soto's emotional distress arising from defamatory statements published by the company must be analyzed under the framework of libel law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. The Whole Course of Conduct Theory</h2>\n<p>Soto argues that the sum total of the repeated defamation, the failure to investigate, and the security interview  FedEx's whole course of conduct  amounts to \"extreme and outrageous conduct,\" even if the individual actions by FedEx, taken separately, would not. We cannot agree, particularly when two of the actions cited by Soto  the repeated accusations that he shipped drugs and the inadequate investigation of that claim  cannot be considered as conduct relevant to the IIED claim. Soto has not described any conduct, taken together or separately, that could properly form the basis of a claim for IIED.</p>\n<p>Because Soto has failed to introduce sufficient evidence to support a finding of \"extreme and outrageous conduct\" by FedEx, his IIED claim necessarily fails. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's denial of FedEx's motion for judgment as a matter of law and vacate Soto's $1.2 million remitted damage award on that claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Libel</h2>\n<p>FedEx also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support Soto's libel claim. Under Puerto Rico law, Soto must prove that FedEx negligently published false and defamatory written statements that caused him actual harm. He must also demonstrate that FedEx abused its conditional privilege to speak about its employees. <i>Porto,</i> 132 D.P.R. 331.</p>\n<p>Soto asserts that FedEx published ten false and defamatory statements stating that he illegally shipped drugs:</p>\n<blockquote> \"The aforementioned [airwaybill] contained approximately one kg. of cocaine.\" Email from Security Specialist Pérez to Station Manager Medina, dated June 6, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"[F]urther investigation . . . revealed that the package contained an undetermined amount of liquid cocaine.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> Incident report written by Pérez, dated June 11, 2002.<sup>[16]</sup></blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"A thorough investigation . . . has determined that you . . . allowed an illegal substance to be transported through the system in further violation of FedEx policies.\" Termination letter (copied to Managing Director Brown and Rodrguez, a human resources officer), dated June 13, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"This violation . . . allowed an illegal substance to be transported through the FedEx system.\" GFTP Memorandum prepared by Medina, dated June 18, 2002.<sup>[17]</sup></blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"[T]his violation of FedEx Policy allowed illegal substances to be shipped through the system.\" GFTP Memorandum prepared by Operations Manager Calero, dated June 18, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"A review . . . clearly demonstrates that . . . the violation . . . allowed an illegal substance to be transported through the FedEx system, putting your fellow FedEx employees at risk.\" Letter from Brown to Soto (copied to Medina, Calero, Acting Human Resources Director Torres, and Rodriguez), dated June 21, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"Whether or not Luis Soto was aware of the contents of the package it is clear that by allowing someone other than an immediate relative to utilize his shipping privileges he allowed an illegal substance to be placed in the FedEx system for transportation.\" GFTP Memorandum prepared by Brown, dated July 1, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"In summary, Mr. Soto . . . placed himself and the Company in jeopardy by allowing illegal substances to be transported through the FedEx system.\" GFTP Memorandum prepared by Rodriguez, dated July 2, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"The local Police Officer tested the contents and it tested positive. The cocaine was then removed from the pkg.\" Email from Matlock, the security specialist in Orlando, to Rodriguez, dated July 8, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> \"A review of this issue revealed that you shipped a package through the FedEx system containing an illegal drug (cocaine).\" Letter from Senior Vice President Colomba to Soto (copied to Brown, Medina, Calero, and Rodriguez, as well as their bosses, Cento, Concepcion, and Gaal), dated July 12, 2002.</blockquote>\n<p>FedEx challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to every element of Soto's libel claim. We address each challenge in turn.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Falsity</h2>\n<p>FedEx insists that Soto failed to establish that the ten allegedly defamatory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> statements were false. FedEx does not assert that the package Soto shipped did, in fact, contain cocaine. Nonetheless, the company argues that even if the FDLE lab results show that Soto's package did not contain cocaine, those results do \"not establish that Bailey, the K-9, did not alert on the package or that the presumptive field test did not return a positive result for cocaine.\" This argument misses the mark. The statements at issue do not assert that the package tested positive for cocaine in the field. Rather, they each conclusively assert that the package actually contained cocaine. Both the FDLE report and the fact that no law enforcement officer ever questioned Soto or Iris Romero about this illegal shipment of drugs permitted the jury to reasonably conclude that the statements were false.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Publication</h2>\n<p>FedEx next argues that Soto failed to establish publication because the statements were published only within FedEx and such intracorporate communications do not satisfy the publication element of the libel claim. This argument reflects an incorrect reading of Puerto Rico law. In <i>Porto,</i> the Puerto Rico Supreme Court expressly adopted the majority rule that intracorporate communication of a defamatory statement satisfies the publication requirement. 132 D.P.R. 331 (\"[W]e hold that the reputation of a person in the workplace may be denigrated through an intracorporate communication and, if there is evidence of the same, the publication requirement is satisfied.\"). FedEx seizes on isolated language later in the opinion, where the court appears to conflate the concepts of publication and privilege by noting that \"[t]he presence of the company personnel manager was completely logical and reasonable\" in a meeting where the allegedly defamatory discharge letter was discussed. <i>Id.</i> However, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's adoption of the rule that the publication requirement is satisfied by intracorporate communications was clear and unequivocal. Thus, the question of whether the internal publication was \"logical and reasonable\" properly belongs in the discussion of conditional privilege, to which we turn next.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Abuse of Conditional Privilege</h2>\n<p>Under Puerto Rico law, communications among \"managers or supervisors of a discharged employee, regarding the reasons for the discharge,\" are conditionally privileged. <i>Porto,</i> 132 D.P.R. 331. This privilege applies to \"`all bona fide communications upon any subject matter in which the author has an interest or with respect to which he has a duty to perform to others.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Caraballo v. P.R. Ilustrado, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></span>, 272 (1949)). It is \"`termed conditional because the person availing himself of it must use it in a lawful manner and for a proper purpose.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Caraballo,</i> 70 P.R.R. at 272). Accordingly, the privilege is lost if the employer abuses it by giving the statement \"excessive publicity\" or by publishing it for \"improper reasons.\"<sup>[19]</sup><i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Although there are no Puerto Rico cases directly on point, case law from other jurisdictions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> suggests that \"improper reasons\" are established and the conditional privilege destroyed where an employer is on notice that the defamatory statements are of questionable validity and yet, with reckless disregard for the truth, fails to adequately investigate their veracity. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>A.B.C. Needlecraft Co. v. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"242596\"><a href=\"/opinion/242596/a-b-c-needlecraft-co-inc-v-dun-bradstreet-inc-and-sigmund/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>, 777 (2d Cir.1957) (holding that evidence was sufficient to warrant submission of the case to the jury as to whether privilege had been abused when defendant's defamatory statement was based on a \"misunderstood casual remark, with no effort to verify facts, though to have done so would have been a simple matter\"); <i>Torosyan v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharm., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">662</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span>, 104 (1995) (conditional privilege destroyed where defendants \"failed to investigate or retract the statement even after the plaintiff notified them that the statement was false and requested further review\"); <i>Wirig v. Kinney Shoe Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1231575\"><a href=\"/opinion/1231575/wirig-v-kinney-shoe-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span>, 380-81 (Minn.1990) (conditional privilege destroyed where \"an employer . . . takes no steps to investigate but relies entirely on accusations either made by employees who may be biased or on second-hand hearsay with no identification of sources\"); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 600 (1977) (conditional privilege fails if statement made with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard as to its truth).</p>\n<p>In this case, the ten defamatory statements made by FedEx were clearly within the scope of the conditional privilege as communications regarding the discharge of an employee. The jury made this finding on the special verdict form, and it has not been challenged on appeal. FedEx contends, however, that Soto did not meet his burden of demonstrating that FedEx had abused the privilege. FedEx cites <i>Cabrero Muñiz v. Zayas Seijo,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1313775</span></span> (P.R.2006),<sup>[20]</sup> for the proposition that \"bad investigation allows an inference [of] real malice only in exceptional circumstances and with the benefit of other evidence tending to show such malice.\" That case concerned the \"actual malice\" requirement in the context of defamation of a public figure, not an inquiry into abuse of the conditional privilege. However, even if we were to conclude that the same standard applies to determine \"improper motive\" in the privilege inquiry, the jury was entitled to infer that the circumstances here were sufficiently exceptional to allow liability to attach.</p>\n<p>The jury heard evidence from which it could reasonably conclude that FedEx was on notice of the questionable validity of the cocaine allegations as early as June 6, when Soto called Pérez and Medina to report that Iris Romero had received the package without incident. FedEx insisted at trial that Soto was dismissed for his violation of the employee shipping policy, not for shipping drugs. As a result, no investigation of the drug allegations was required. However, regardless of the reasons behind the dismissal, once FedEx was on notice that the drug allegations were questionable, it was obligated to either stop repeating them or adequately investigate them. It did neither. As a result, the jury was entitled to conclude that FedEx had \"improper motives\" and thereby lost the benefit of the conditional privilege because it acted with reckless disregard for the truth.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> 4. Sufficiency of Evidence on Actual Harm</h2>\n<p>FedEx also asserts that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the libel claim because Soto failed to prove that he suffered emotional distress as a result of the publication of the libelous statements, rather than merely as a result of reading those statements himself. We reject this assertion. The jury could have reasonably inferred that Soto's reputation within FedEx was harmed by the connection between his name and the drug allegations. <i>See </i><i>Porto,</i> 132 D.P.R. 331 (\"[C]orporate employees are only too human and when they learn of a defamatory statement the reputation of the affected employee is clearly demeaned in the workplace.\"). Moreover, Soto did present evidence about the shame and humiliation he experienced as a direct result of knowing that the drug allegations were circulating among FedEx management. He explained, for example, that when he received the letter from Senior Vice President Colomba: \"[L]ife came to an end for me because having a V.P. of the company state that I had sent drugs, cocaine. . . . My world came to an end, fell on me.\" No more is required to sustain the jury's finding of liability on the libel claim. <i>See </i><i>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109091\"><a href=\"/opinion/109091/gertz-v-robert-welch-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 350, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109091\"><a href=\"/opinion/109091/gertz-v-robert-welch-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Accordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of FedEx's motion for judgment as a matter of law on that claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>In addition to its sufficiency challenges, FedEx contends that the district court improperly admitted damage testimony that was not causally linked to any issue in the case and that this evidence improperly inflated the jury's damage award. In reviewing an allegation of evidentiary error, we must consider first whether the district court erred and then whether this error was harmful. <i>Ahern v. Scholz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196795\"><a href=\"/opinion/196795/ahern-v-scholz/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span>, 786 (1st Cir.1996). \"A trial court's error in an evidentiary ruling only rises to the level of harmful error if a party's substantial right is affected.\" <i>Id.</i> To determine whether a substantial right is implicated, we examine \"the centrality of the evidence and the prejudicial effect of its . . . inclusion.\" <i>Id.</i> Given our disposition of the slander and IIED claims, we consider only whether the admission of the damage evidence was prejudicial error that tainted the award on the surviving libel claim.</p>\n<p>Over FedEx's objections, the district court allowed Soto to testify extensively about emotional damages he suffered as a result of the financial difficulties his family encountered after he lost his job at FedEx. For example, he testified: \"We don't have as much time as we had before to share. . . . I work more. [My wife] has had to take on providing, giving tutoring services because she is a teacher. So, she gets home from school and sometimes when I get home from work she is still dealing with Martin. Martin is my young boy and my intimate life was also affected.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> More specifically, Soto's counsel asked what problems he confronted \"after the situation with FedEx with respect\" to the child support payment he owed for another child who lived with his ex-wife, Janet. He replied:</p>\n<blockquote>Well, since they would take it from my salary check, I had problems with the Family Department which is the one that has to do with child support. I talked with Janet. She is Ricardo's mother. I told her that I had been fired from Federal Express; that I had to take the steps to get another job in order to be able to pay for the child support; that I could not send him the same amount because I didn't know what my salary was going to be. She understood it but since the payment was not reaching the Family Department, well, I was summoned. I was summoned. I asked Janet to write a letter stating that I had sent her the money and she behaved very good with me and so then I submitted it to the judge who was presiding over the case. He lowered the sum. . . .</blockquote>\n<p>Soto's counsel then asked how the situation with the child support made Soto feel. He responded: \"It made me feel very bad because besides the fact that I would always pay and it would be deducted from my salary, I always made sure that Ricardo wasn't needing anything.\"</p>\n<p>Soto also testified about his family's need to cancel a vacation in Florida as a result of his termination:</p>\n<blockquote>I first told my wife's relatives, family in Orlando because they were expecting us to go there on vacation. So, we had to cancel vacations because one of the benefits employees had with FedEx was that we could buy discount[ed] air fare. We had discount air fare to buy tickets and the manager has to authorize you so you can purchase the ticket and that is when the suspension came up and then termination but by then they were all expecting us. They are all over there and so then after step one [of the GFTP review] we called Lisa's family and told them about the tragedy.</blockquote>\n<p>Soto testified that after his termination he obtained positions at Caribbean Products and then DHL through connections with family and former co-workers. When Soto was laid-off from DHL, his supervisor there recommended him for a position at Advance, where he worked at the time of trial. At FedEx he made $17.45 per hour, at DHL he started at $9.75, and he was earning less than that at Advanced at the time of the trial. A. 1116. Soto's counsel asked how these lower earnings affected him emotionally. He replied: \"Well, right now I depend on my wife to be able to pay things for the house. I feel impotent because of what I cannot do now. Before I used to be the head of the household and now sometimes I have to go to my father-in-law to ask him for help and I do it now very embarrassed because I never did that before.\"<sup>[22]</sup></p>\n<p>There was never any testimony, however, establishing that Caribbean Products, DHL, or Advanced ever saw the libelous statements published by FedEx. There was no testimony that Soto's subsequent employers' knowledge of his termination at FedEx adversely impacted his job placement or pay. There was no testimony that he was not hired at any other company to which he applied as a result of the events at FedEx.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> Soto's financial struggles and the emotional turmoil they caused have no causal connection to the libel claim. Instead, the emotional distress Soto described is causally related only to the <i>fact</i> of termination and thus is evidence only of the damages suffered by Soto as a result of the wrongful termination itself. These damages were not properly before the jury because, as we have explained, such damages are compensable only pursuant to Act 80, which specifies a statutorily calculated damage award based on an employee's salary and years of service. That statute does not permit the recovery of emotional distress damages for a wrongful termination.</p>\n<p>Soto's testimony regarding the emotional suffering he endured as a result of his economic struggles would have been admissible and relevant to prove Soto's damages if he had supplied a causal link between his economic hardships and the defamatory statements made by FedEx. For example, Soto might have introduced evidence that, after his termination by FedEx, a prospective employer heard the drug allegations and, as result, refused to offer him a job. However, such a causal link was never established here.<sup>[23]</sup> Soto did not introduce any evidence suggesting that a subsequent employer or potential employer treated Soto adversely as a result of the defamatory statements made by FedEx. Indeed, Soto failed to show that those statements were ever published to anyone outside of FedEx. In the absence of such evidence, the powerful testimony regarding Soto's struggle to pay his child support, his wife's need to take on more tutoring, their need to cancel their vacation to Florida, and their need to rely financially on Rosario's father was legally irrelevant to any issue properly before the jury.<sup>[24]</sup> Thus, we conclude that the district court erred in admitting this testimony.</p>\n<p>We are also convinced that the evidentiary error was not harmless. The district court did instruct the jury that, with regard to damages for defamation, \"any award you choose to make to compensate the Plaintiff may only be to redress the consequences which followed from the injury to the Plaintiff's reputation,\" and that \"Plaintiffs cannot recover emotional damages that arise as a result of the mere fact that Soto Lébron's employment was terminated.\" However, the erroneously admitted evidence was the most emotionally compelling and specific damage evidence Soto presented. It would have been nearly impossible for the jury to ignore the harsh consequences to Soto and his family stemming from his wrongful termination.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the size of the $3 million libel award confirms that impossibility. In its remittitur decision, the district court summarized the damage evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Plaintiffs presented a picture of a forty-six year old father of two who, after a successful fourteen-year tenure at Federal Express, was faced with a false <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> accusation that he had mailed drugs and had to endure the fact that such accusation was reproduced in several written communications between his supervisors and other members of Defendant's management team. Furthermore, Plaintiffs emphasized the distress attendant to Co-plaintiff Soto's interview with Defendant's security specialist and his subsequent physical ouster of the company's premises. Plaintiff's evidence showed that Co-plaintiff Soto was distraught, humiliated, even with regards to his family, had trouble sleeping and suffered from anxiety, was generally unhappy and lost interest in his former pastimes. Plaintiffs' evidence also demonstrated that Co-plaintiff Soto was affected to such a degree that he had to seek out mental health services and take medication.</blockquote>\n<p>This summary does not distinguish between the emotional damages properly attributable to the libel claim and those related only to the economic damages caused by the termination. This same failure to distinguish by the jury affected a $3 million libel award that was grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the damages causally related to the libel.</p>\n<p>Emotional damages, though difficult to quantify, are not immune from appellate review. <i>Koster v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198522\"><a href=\"/opinion/198522/koster-v-trans-world/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 34-35 (1st Cir.1999). Here, the evidence reveals that Soto was not disabled  either permanently or temporarily  by his emotional distress. He was able to find a new job and continue working within his field. Moreover, he did not introduce any medical evidence to prove the severity of his distress. <i>Id.</i> at 35 (\"[A]lthough emotional damages are warranted even without medical or psychiatric evidence, the lack of such evidence is relevant to the amount of award.\"). Thus, given the enormous size of the award here, it appears that the erroneously admitted damage evidence tainted the verdict by leading the jury to compensate Soto not only for the emotional damages stemming from the defamation but also for the emotional distress he suffered as a result of his economic woes following the termination.</p>\n<p>The prejudicial effect of the erroneously admitted evidence could have been removed by a sufficient remittitur. However, the remitted $1.8 million award remains far beyond the damages supported by Soto's properly admitted, causally valid damage evidence. <i>See </i><i>Sanchez v. Puerto Rico Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679955\"><a href=\"/opinion/679955/jose-l-sanchez-v-puerto-rico-oil-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">712</span></a></span>, 724 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that a remitted award may be overturned if \"the reduced figure remains so extravagant as to shock the appellate conscience.\"); <i>Wagenmann v. Adams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494589\"><a href=\"/opinion/494589/ronald-e-wagenmann-v-russell-j-adams-appeal-of-gerald-r-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 215 (1st Cir.1987) (reviewing a remitted verdict to determine whether the appellant has shown that \"the reduced sums remain so exorbitant, so disturbing to our collective conscience, as to entitle [it] to [a] new trial[ ]\").</p>\n<p>The two cases cited by the district court in support of its remittitur suggest that the remitted award should have been far lower. First, the district court cited <i>Shaffer v. State of Ariz. Citizens Clean Election Comm'n,</i> No. 03CV2344PHXFJM, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">155880</span></span>, at *3 (D.Ariz. Jan.19, 2006), noting that the judge there had reduced the damages on a defamation claim by 40% \"because the jury took into account damages stemming from plaintiff's termination.\" This characterization of <i>Shaffer</i> suggests that the district court in Soto's case may have been aware of the causation problems in the damage testimony. However, the <i>Shaffer</i> case itself illustrates why the district court's remittitur here was insufficient to cure the evidentiary error.</p>\n<p>In <i>Shaffer,</i> a government employee had been wrongfully accused of felony fraud by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> his employer and the accusation was released to the media and appeared in the news. The district court reduced the $1.1 million damages award to $660,000. Unlike Soto, Shaffer's prospective employers had been exposed to the defamatory statements through the media. <i>Id.</i> at *2. However, the trial court noted that Shaffer, like Soto, had \"failed to produce any evidence that prospective employers considered the defamatory statement in rejecting Shaffer's employment applications.\" <i>Id.</i> at *3. The <i>Shaffer</i> court also noted a causation problem within the damage award: \"Moreover, it is equally plausible that Shaffer's difficulty in finding employment following his termination arose substantially from the fact that he was dismissed from his prior position. Similarly, his emotional and reputation difficulties logically arose in part from his termination.\" <i>Id.</i> In Soto's case, where there was no evidence that any prospective employer was exposed to the defamatory statements, it is not merely \"equally plausible\" that his economic difficulties, and the emotional distress they caused, were unrelated to the defamatory statements. It is, in fact, the only reasonable inference. Nonetheless, Soto's remitted verdict remains nearly three times larger than the remitted verdict in <i>Shaffer.</i></p>\n<p>The second case cited by the district court, <i>McCann v. Ruiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1650133\"><a href=\"/opinion/1650133/mccann-v-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">802</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">606</span></a></span> (D.P.R.1992), similarly does not support the $1.8 million remitted award. In that case, the court observed that the plaintiff had \"suffered a mild form of depression and was concerned about his future and the future of his family\" as a result of his employer's defamatory statements. <i>Id.</i> at 616. However, noting that the plaintiff's suffering \"apparently did not require treatment nor . . . result in any permanent injury,\" the district court found the jury's award of $255,000 to be \"grossly excessive\" and ordered a remitted award of $100,000. <i>Id.</i> Soto arguably suffered a marginally more severe injury than McCann because he sought treatment from a psychiatrist. However, that distinction between the cases cannot support the enormous variance between the size of Soto's award and the award in <i>McCann.</i></p>\n<p>The remittitur in <i>Budet-Correa v. United Parcel Service,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569263\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569263/budet-correa-v-united-parcel-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span> (D.P.R.2004), provides another pertinent point of comparison. In that case, the court reduced a jury award of $825,000 in emotional distress damages to an employee of UPS who was accused of attempted murder and received a death threat from a security officer hired by the company to surveil him.<sup>[25]</sup> The plaintiff in that case introduced testimony from his treating psychologist to establish that he had an anxiety disorder. He also introduced evidence that he had been declared disabled and received Social Security disability benefits as a result of the psychological injury attributable to UPS's conduct. Despite this evidence, the court concluded that the jury award was \"grossly disproportionate to the injuries established by the evidence\" and reduced the award to $250,000. <i>Id.</i> at 142. Soto's damage evidence did not include any expert psychological testimony and did not come close to establishing that he was disabled by his emotional injury. Given these comparisons, the $1.8 million award here remains shockingly exorbitant.</p>\n<p>The district court's task was to determine the <i>maximum dollar amount</i> that is supported by the evidence. <i>Conjugal P'ship Comprised by </i><i>Joseph Jones &amp; Verneta G. Jones v. Conjugal P'ship Comprised</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> <i>by Arthur Pineda &amp; Toni Pineda,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195349\"><a href=\"/opinion/195349/jones-v-pineda/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span>, 398 (1st Cir.1994). The <i>Shaffer, McCann,</i> and <i>Budet-Correa</i> cases do not support the district court's determination of that maximum dollar amount here. If Shaffer's $1.1 million jury award, McCann's $255,000 award, and Budet-Correa's $825,000 award were each grossly excessive, they cannot help to explain why a $1.8 million award in Soto's case is appropriate.<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p>This is not a case where we are merely second-guessing the amount of the district court's remittitur. <i>See </i><i>Sanchez,</i> 37 F.3d at 724 (noting that when the district court has already ordered a remittitur, the appellate court's review of the remaining award is permissible, but quite constrained). Here, there is an identifiable legal error that is at the heart of the jury's inflated award.<sup>[27]</sup> We cannot discern from the court's remittitur decision whether an awareness of this legal error may have been a factor in that decision. In any case, the district court's remittitur was insufficient to correct the legal error in admitting the causally flawed damage testimony. Accordingly, we conclude that the damage award has been prejudicially tainted and must be vacated.<sup>[28]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> We also conclude that our decision to vacate the damage award for libel does not require us to vacate the liability finding as well. The district court used a detailed special verdict form, and appropriate instructions, that required the jury to keep its liability determination separate from its valuation of the damages. Thus, we conclude that the evidentiary error that skewed the damage award here did not taint the finding of liability for libel. That finding was, as we describe above, amply supported by admissible evidence. Moreover, we are confident that the damage issue is \"`so distinct and separable from the other issues that a trial of [that] issue[ ] alone may be had without injustice.'\" <i>La Plante v. Am. Honda Motor Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672852\"><a href=\"/opinion/672852/39-fed-r-evid-serv-987-prodliabrep-cch-p-13935-arthur-h-la/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 738 (1st Cir.1994); <i>Mandel v.

As a result, the damages may be retried as the sole issue on remand. The newly constituted jury will be able to evaluate Soto's damages after hearing only the evidence that is causally related to the libel claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p>Although FedEx has prevailed on most of its appellate issues, its happiness with that outcome should be muted. The company's termination of Soto's employment was handled badly, even though Soto himself bears some responsibility for his predicament because of his violation of the company's employee shipping policy. Still, for reasons that remain murky, FedEx never secured the lab report, completed while the review of Soto's termination was still underway, which demonstrates that the suspicious substance in the package that Soto shipped was not liquid cocaine. This failure to secure that exculpatory drug report cost Soto his job and caused much of the misery for the Soto family that followed. Even though the jury's evaluation of this sad story cannot withstand appellate review for the reasons cited herein, FedEx should understand that judgment of the jury for what it was  a sharp rebuke for the company's handling of Soto's termination.</p>\n<p>In summary, we affirm the district court's grant of FedEx's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the slander claim. We reverse the district court's denial of FedEx's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the IIED claim. We affirm the district court's denial of FedEx's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the libel claim, but vacate the damage awards for both Soto and Rosario on the libel claim. We remand for a new trial on damages relating to the libel claim. Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The complaint also named the conjugal partnership comprised of Soto and Rosario as a co-plaintiff.</p>\n<p>[2]  Because Rosario's claim is derivative, we refer to Soto, at times, as if he were the sole plaintiff.</p>\n<p>[3]  Section 7-35 of FedEx's \"People Manual\" states: \"FedEx Express offers FedEx Express employees . . . reduced rates for personal shipping.\" The \"Employee Eligibility\" portion of the policy states that \"[t]his policy intends to offer discount shipping through the FedEx Express system to eligible employees and members of their immediate families (spouse or dependent children) as an employee benefit.\" Soto acknowledged receipt of this policy by signing a memorandum, dated August 30, 2001, that warned him that \"[a]ny abuse of this benefit may result in termination.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  Soto consented to having the security interview tape recorded, but FedEx never produced the tape during discovery, reporting it lost. Accordingly, the court gave the jury a spoliation instruction, permitting the jury to draw an adverse inference from the disappearance of the tape. The facts recited herein represent Soto's description of the security interview.</p>\n<p>[5]  The record does not reveal what \"Becton and Dickinson\" is or why FedEx security personnel used this name for the lab.</p>\n<p>[6]  It appears that Pérez obtained this information from his supervisor, who had received it from FedEx security personnel in Florida.</p>\n<p>[7]  Both Iris Romero and her daughter testified that the package had been delivered by a FedEx truck on June 4. The package was shown to the jury. Iris testified that one of the bottles, the hair relaxer, was not in its original package (\"it had been taken out and place[d] in a ziplock bag\"). No one from any law enforcement agency ever contacted Iris or Soto regarding the package.</p>\n<p>[8]  FedEx challenges this evidentiary ruling on several grounds. However, we perceive no abuse of discretion in the district court's decision.</p>\n<p>[9]  This appears to be a reference to Pérez, the security specialist who had first interviewed Soto.</p>\n<p>[10]  The official translations of many of the Puerto Rico cases cited herein do not contain internal page numbers. Accordingly, we cannot include pin-point citation references for those cases.</p>\n<p>[11]  This case is not available in English translation in Westlaw's database. We have relied on the slip version of the official translation.</p>\n<p>[12]  The jury could have found liability for wrongful termination either by concluding that the termination was at least partially motivated by the unfounded drug allegations or by concluding that a single violation of the employee shipping policy would not be good cause for termination unless the package actually contained cocaine. Either way, FedEx's inadequate investigation of the drug allegations is implicated in the wrongful termination verdict.</p>\n<p>[13]  Soto presented claims for both slander and libel at trial. The two causes of action differ only in that the slander claim is founded on oral statements, which allegedly accounted for the widespread rumors of Soto's involvement with drugs, while the libel claim is founded on written statements.</p>\n<p>[14]  Soto's brief states that \"the IIED claim revolves around facts that are separate and distinct from the defamation claim and involve different injuries.\" Although other portions of the brief appear to marshal the defamatory conduct in support of his IIED claim, this statement appears to be an acknowledgment that FedEx's defamatory actions cannot form the basis of Soto's IIED claim.</p>\n<p>[15]  Soto also argues that the \"mysterious\" disappearance of the audio tape of the security interview should be considered as one element in FedEx's egregious course of conduct. However, Soto was unaware that the tape had been lost until FedEx failed to produce it during discovery in this case. As such, its disappearance is not relevant conduct for the IIED inquiry. <i>See </i><i>Knussman v. Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775680\"><a href=\"/opinion/775680/howard-kevin-knussman-and-kimberly-ann-knussman-on-behalf-of-themselves/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span>, 641 (4th Cir.2001) (\"Generally speaking, litigation-induced emotional distress is never a compensable element of damages.\").</p>\n<p>[16]  FedEx separately challenges whether this statement was ever published to any other person within FedEx. However, Operations Manager Calero's report dated June 11 explicitly refers to an investigation by Pérez. Thus, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to infer that Calero read Pérez's incident report in preparing his own report.</p>\n<p>[17]  Each of the GFTP memoranda circulated among FedEx management and human resources personnel who were participating in the GFTP review process.</p>\n<p>[18]  FedEx also claims that the district court erred in refusing to include a separate interrogatory as to each individual defamatory statement on the special verdict form. However, the district court did instruct the jury that it must consider each communication separately in making a determination regarding Soto's libel claim. The special verdict form here was already long and detailed. It was well within the district court's discretion to determine that the jury instruction was sufficient and that the special verdict form requested by FedEx was unnecessarily detailed. <i>See </i><i>Santos v. Posadas De P.R. Assocs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202293\"><a href=\"/opinion/202293/santos-v-wyndham-condado/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 65 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>[19]  FedEx asserts on appeal that plaintiffs were required to meet their burden on this issue with \"clear and convincing evidence.\" Puerto Rico has not adopted this standard and the jury was instructed, without objection, that the preponderance of the evidence standard applies. As such, the preponderance standard is the law of the case. <i>See </i><i>Rodriguez-Torres,</i> 399 F.3d at 58. FedEx also challenges the district court's refusal to instruct the jury that \"good faith is presumed.\" However, the court did instruct the jury that Soto bore the burden of establishing that FedEx abused its conditional privilege. No more was required.</p>\n<p>[20]  The English translation of this case is not available on Westlaw. We have relied on a certified slip translation.</p>\n<p>[21]  The jury could also have reasonably concluded that, because FedEx had not adequately investigated the drug allegations, its frequent repetition of those allegations constituted \"excessive publication\" of the defamatory statements, resulting in loss of the conditional privilege. <i>See </i><i>Porto,</i> 132 D.P.R. 331 (noting \"excessive publication\" destroys the conditional privilege).</p>\n<p>[22]  Similar testimony was also offered by Rosario's father, who explained that he \"had to help them pay[] the studies of the little boy. . . at La Piedad School . . . [and also help pay for] some sports studies he was taking.\"</p>\n<p>[23]  The district court apparently believed that evidence linking the statements and Soto's financial difficulty would be introduced and ruled that this damage testimony could come in because Soto was entitled to show the emotional harm he suffered as a result of FedEx's defamatory statements reaching future employers. However, at the end of the trial, this causal link was still missing.</p>\n<p>[24]  Such evidence was also irrelevant to the IIED claim, even if that were a viable claim, because there was never any suggestion that FedEx's security interview or \"course of conduct\" rendered Soto so emotionally incapacitated as to make him unable to look for work, find work, or perform well on the job. Thus, there is nothing to link the financial hardships the family experienced following the termination to the allegedly outrageous conduct of FedEx.</p>\n<p>[25]  The theory of liability in <i>Budet-Correa</i> was intentional infliction of emotional distress (based upon the death threat by the security officer), rather than libel, but the case is nevertheless instructive as to the valuation of emotional damages.</p>\n<p>[26]  In searching for similar verdicts to guide our review of the level of emotional damages here, we follow the lead of the parties and the district court and consider cases from both Puerto Rico and other U.S. jurisdictions. These cases universally suggest that the $1.8 million dollar award is grossly excessive. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Whitfield v. Meléndez-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2005) (reducing award from $500,000 to $100,000 for mother of plaintiff who was shot twice in the leg by police officers; mother testified that \"she was so distraught that she could not work for a month\"); <i>Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Mountain Home v. Globe Int'l Publ'g, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593958\"><a href=\"/opinion/593958/peoples-bank-and-trust-company-of-mountain-home-conservator-of-the-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1065</span></a></span>, 1071 (8th Cir.1992) (jury verdict of $650,000 remanded for \"substantial remittitur\" where damage evidence was \"limited to testimony describing [the plaintiff] as angry, upset, humiliated, embarrassed, depressed and disturbed\"); <i>Rady v. Forest City Enters., Inc.,</i> 27 Ohio Misc.2d 36, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span></span>, 690 (Com.Pl.1986) (vacating a $1,000,000 compensatory award in a libel case where \"[p]laintiff's discharge and the underlying accusations were not disclosed to persons outside the immediate group composed of her supervisors and those responsible for hiring and firing\"). The cases cited by Soto in support of the $1.8 million award each involve the defamation of individuals who were prevented, by the defamation, from returning to work in their chosen fields. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Purgess v. Sharrock,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676990\"><a href=\"/opinion/676990/jan-r-purgess-md-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-nigel-sharrock/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1994) (upholding $3.5 million award, which appears to have encompassed both emotional distress and lost future wages, for anesthesiologist based on defamatory statements accusing him of malpractice and preventing him from finding work in a private hospital).</p>\n<p>[27]  In some cases, an appellate court that finds a jury's verdict to be grossly disproportionate to the injuries established by the evidence may order its own remittitur, setting the proper amount of the verdict without the need for a second trial on damages. <i>See</i> 11 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d</i> § 2820 (\"If the appellate court concludes that the verdict is excessive, it need not necessarily reverse and order a new trial. It may give plaintiff an alternative by ordering a new trial unless plaintiff will consent to a remittitur in a specified amount.\"); <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Koster,</i> 181 F.3d at 36 (concluding that \"the evidence of emotional distress would support a maximum recovery of emotional damages of $250,000\" and conditioning a new trial on damages on plaintiff's rejection of that lower amount); <i>Marchant v. Dayton Tire &amp; Rubber Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499728\"><a href=\"/opinion/499728/john-s-marchant-v-the-dayton-tire-rubber-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">695</span></a></span>, 704 (1st Cir.1988) (setting remittitur at $300,000). In such cases, there is generally no identifiable legal error that accounts for the inflated award. In this case, where an identifiable evidentiary error directly affected the valuation of Soto's emotional distress, we conclude that our best course of action is to remand for a new trial rather than attempting to derive a maximum recovery amount from the flawed evidentiary record.</p>\n<p>[28]  Rosario's derivative award of $1 million was affected by the same evidentiary error and, additionally, includes damages for the emotional distress attributable to the now-vacated slander and IIED verdicts, and must also be vacated.</p>\n\n</div>",
