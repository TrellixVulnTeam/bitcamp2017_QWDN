Plaintiff-Appellant\n\nDiane Dressler (\"Dressler\") appeals the summary judgment order\n\nentered     on   behalf    of   Defendants-Appellees    Kevin   J.    Daniel\n\n(\"Daniel\") and Daniel's Pub, Inc. (\"Daniel's Pub\") (collectively\n\n\"employer\") on an action arising under Title VII of the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq. (\"Title VII\").\n\nDressler claims that she is the victim of retaliation by her former\n\nemployer,    after   initiating    a   sexual   harassment   claim   against\n\nDaniel.   See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).        Dressler asserts that due to\n\nthe retaliatory actions taken by her former employer, she was\n\ndenied future employment opportunities and subjected to a hostile\n\nwork environment.         We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1292. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            While attending college in 1988, Dressler met Daniel, and\n\nthe two engaged in a relationship that Dressler alleges was non-\n\nsexual but romantic. There was little contact between Dressler and\n\nDaniel after their relationship ended until 1996, when Dressler\n\nmoved to Henniker, New Hampshire and contacted Daniel. Thereafter,\n\nDressler claims that she and Daniel engaged in a romantic, sexual\n\nrelationship which lasted approximately two months.                  Dressler\n\ninformed Daniel that the relationship would end in December 1996,\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fafter she accepted employment at his restaurant, Daniel's Pub.1\n\nDressler worked at Daniel's Pub from December 15, 1996 to December\n\n31, 1996, when she terminated her employment.        Shortly thereafter,\n\nshe contacted the New Hampshire Center for Human Rights to pursue\n\ncharges   of    sexual   harassment    against   Daniel.   A   negotiated\n\nsettlement was reached between Dressler and the employer.\n\n            From July 1997 to September 1998, Dressler alleges that\n\nshe and Daniel again engaged in a discreet romantic and sexual\n\nrelationship. After the relationship ended, Dressler took a job as\n\na planning room aide at Kearsarge Middle School (\"KMS\") in London,\n\nNew Hampshire, where Daniel's daughter attended school.\n\n            Dressler quit her job at KMS in December 1998 contending\n\nthat comments were broadcast in the school that subsequently\n\naffected her job responsibilities and work environment.          A former\n\nco-worker at Daniel's Pub, who also worked at KMS, informed the\n\nVice-Principal that there may be some concerns over the propriety\n\nof Dressler working with Daniel's daughter.           The Vice-Principal\n\nstated that this comment had no impact on his evaluation of\n\nDressler.      Nothing in the evidence suggests that Daniel made any\n\ncomments to KMS.\n\n            While employed at KMS, Dressler applied for a position at\n\nthe Equity Group in New London, New Hampshire.        She attributed her\n\n\n\n     1\n      Daniel was the president, general manager, and director of\nDaniel's Pub during Dressler's employment.\n\n                                      -3-\n\frejection for employment at the Equity Group to statements made by\n\nDaniel to her prospective employer.               James Ward, the owner of the\n\nEquity Group, attested in an affidavit that he contacted Daniel and\n\nrecalls from his conversation with Daniel that \"the parting of ways\n\n[between Daniel's Pub and Dressler] was on somewhat less than\n\nfavorable terms and this did not prevent me from hiring her, as\n\nthere were other issues.\"              Dressler claims that she was told by\n\nJames Ward that he did not want claims filed against him.                          Daniel\n\nclaims   that     he    has    never    been    asked   to    provide    a   reference\n\nconcerning Dressler by a prospective or current employer and has\n\nnot    offered     unsolicited         information       with    respect          to    her\n\nqualifications.\n\n            In March 1999, Daniel filed a complaint with the Henniker\n\nand Newbury Police Departments relating to a stalking charge he\n\nplanned to file against Dressler.               Daniel believed that statements\n\nto the police would not be public information but would serve\n\ninvestigatory purposes only. Dressler learned about the complaints\n\nin August 1999 when she was contacted by the police department.\n\n            Dressler      filed    an    action    in    federal    district           court\n\nagainst appellees alleging violations of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. §\n\n2000e, et seq., § 1981           and/or § 1981a, as well as pendent state\n\nlaw claims.       The district court granted summary judgment in favor\n\nof    appellees    on    the    federal    claims       and   declined       to    assert\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the state claims.                   Dressler appeals\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\ffrom the summary judgment order denying her Title VII retaliation\n\nclaim.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           It is unlawful for an employer to retaliate against an\n\nemployee for initiating an action under Title VII.            42 U.S.C. §\n\n2000e-3(a) provides:\n\n     It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\n     employer to discriminate against any of his employees .\n     . . because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\n     participated in any manner in an investigation,\n     proceeding, or hearing under this title.\n\nTo establish a prima facie case of retaliation, Dressler must prove\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence that \"(1) [s]he engaged in\n\nprotected conduct under Title VII; (2) [s]he suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action; and (3) the adverse action is causally connected\n\nto the protected activity.\" White v. New Hampshire Dep't of Corr.,\n\n221 F.3d 254, 262 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting Hernandez-Torres v.\n\nIntercontinental Trading, Inc., 158 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 1998));\n\nHoeppner v. Crotched Mountain Rehab. Ctr., 31 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n1994); see also Kearney v. Town of Wareham, No. 02-1264, slip op.\n\nat 11-12 (1st Cir. Dec. 10, 2002).\n\n           Reporting sexual harassment or initiating a charge of\n\nsexual   harassment   is   a   protected   activity   under   Title   VII.\n\nHoeppner, 31 F.3d at 14.       Dressler initiated a complaint against\n\nDaniel for sexual harassment that occurred while she was working at\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fDaniel's Pub in December of 1996.       Therefore, Dressler satisfies\n\nthe first prong of a Title VII retaliation claim.\n\n            Dressler claims that she suffered an adverse employment\n\naction because of her hostile work environment at KMS and because\n\nshe was denied prospective employment.         She contends that her\n\nemployment at KMS suffered because she lost job responsibilities\n\nand her working environment became hostile as a result of Daniel's\n\nactions, which eventually forced her to terminate her employment at\n\nKMS.   Dressler also claims that Daniel interfered with future job\n\nopportunities through his conversation with a prospective employer.\n\nDressler, however, provides no proof that Daniel affected her\n\nemployment or future employment.       Discussing the specific details\n\nof these two allegations is unproductive since these acts are\n\nbarred by the filing period for retaliation claims under Title VII.\n\n            Title VII requires that an aggrieved individual exhaust\n\nhis or her administrative remedies as a prerequisite to filing suit\n\nin federal court.   The individual must file a charge with the EEOC\n\nwithin 180 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice\n\noccurred.    42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1).     The filing period operates\n\nas a statute of limitations.     In a deferral state, such as New\n\nHampshire, the filing period is extended to 300 days.         Id.; 29\n\nC.F.R. § 1601.74. Any claim for retaliatory acts beyond the filing\n\nperiod is barred because \"[e]ach discrete discriminatory act starts\n\na new clock for filing the charges alleging the act.\"         National\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fR.R. Passenger       Corp. v.   Morgan,   122   S.Ct.   2061,   2072   (2002)\n\n(holding that discrete discriminatory or retaliatory acts must be\n\nfiled within the appropriate time period, but that in hostile work\n\nenvironment claims, the time limitation will not exclude acts that\n\nare part of the same unlawful employment practice if at least one\n\nact falls within the time period); see also Provencher v. CVS\n\nPharmacy, Div. Of Melville Corp., 145 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n               Since Dressler filed a complaint with the EEOC on May 15,\n\n2000, the limitations period extends back to July 20, 1999.2\n\nDressler claims that she was retaliated against (1) when she was\n\ndenied a prospective employment opportunity at the Equity Group in\n\nthe fall of 1998, (2) when she perceived a hostile work environment\n\nat KMS that resulted in her termination in December 1998, and (3)\n\nwhen Daniel filed complaints against her with the Henniker and\n\nNewbury Police Departments in March 1999.3         The first two discreet\n\nacts of alleged retaliation fall outside the filing period; and as\n\nnoted above, these acts are time barred.         See Morgan, 122 S.Ct. at\n\n2077.       As to the third act, however, Dressler claims that she was\n\nnot aware that the police complaints had been filed until August 3,\n\n\n     2\n      The district court mistakenly stated in footnote one that the\nlimitations period extended to July 20, 2000.          This was a\ntypographical error and did not affect the court's analysis.\n        3\n      The district court incorrectly noted that Daniel filed his\ncomplaints in March 2000 instead of March 1999 and that Dressler\ndid not find out about the complaints until August 2000 instead of\nAugust 1999. This, however, did not affect the district court's\nanalysis.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f1999.     The   district   court   assumed    arguendo      that   Dressler's\n\ncomplaint was filed timely with regard to the police department\n\ncomplaints since she did not find out about the complaints until\n\nAugust 1999.     We will also assume for analytical purposes that\n\nDressler's   EEOC   complaint   was   filed   timely   as    to    the   police\n\ndepartment complaints. Therefore, the only relevant actions by the\n\nemployer within the filing period are the complaints filed by\n\nDaniel with the police departments.\n\n           The district court assumed arguendo that the complaints\n\nto the police departments were sufficiently \"adverse\" to constitute\n\nactionable retaliation.      See Hoeppner, 31 F.3d at 14-15.             If we\n\naccept the district court's assumption that the filing of police\n\ncomplaints by Daniel constituted an adverse employment action, such\n\naction must be causally connected to the protected activity to\n\nmaintain an action for a Title VII violation.          White, 221 F.3d at\n\n262.    Dressler's claim can only survive if the evidence on the\n\nrecord could support a claim that Daniel's true motive for filing\n\nthe complaints with the police department was Dressler's initiation\n\nof a sexual harassment claim in January 1997.            See Hoeppner, 31\n\nF.3d at 14; Kearney, No. 02-1264, slip op. at 12.\n\n           The district court properly found that the close temporal\n\nproximity to support a finding of retaliation was lacking.               Since\n\nthe initiation of the 1997 sexual harassment claim, the parties had\n\na rather unusual relationship. Dressler claims that she and Daniel\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fengaged in a sexual relationship extending for over one year after\n\nthe sexual harassment claim had been settled. The adverse actions\n\ncharged     by    Dressler    occurred        after   this     sexual/romantic\n\nrelationship had ended.           Two years had elapsed between the time\n\nDressler engaged in the protected activity of initiating a sexual\n\nharassment complaint against Daniel and the time of the alleged\n\nadverse action, Daniel's filing of the police complaints against\n\nDressler.        The   district    court     found--and   we   agree--that   no\n\n\"reasonable trier of fact could conclude, by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence, that the 1999 complaints to the police were caused by the\n\n1997 sexual harassment charge.\"              Moreover, the inference of a\n\ncausal connection becomes tenuous with the passage of time.              Lewis\n\nv. Gillette Co., 22 F.3d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 1994) (granting summary\n\njudgment where more than two years elapsed between the protected\n\nconduct and the alleged retaliation); Mesnick v. General Elec.\n\nCorp., 950 F.2d 816, 828 (1st Cir. 1991) (holding that the nine\n\nmonth period between the protected conduct and alleged retaliation\n\nundermined the inference of causation).\n\n            Construing the record in the light most favorable to\n\nDressler and resolving all reasonable inferences in her favor, we\n\nconclude that the record does not support a finding that Daniel's\n\nmotive for filing a complaint was in response to Dressler's sexual\n\nharassment claim.       See Gorski v. New Hampshire Dep't of Corr., 290\n\nF.3d 466, 471 (1st Cir. 2002).          In fact, the record suggests that\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fthe nature of the interactions between the parties was such that,\n\nas   the     district   court    wrote,   \"events    more   recent    than   the\n\ndiscrimination charge were far more likely than the charge to have\n\ninformed the state of the parties' relationship in March 1999.\"\n\nAfter the conclusion of the parties' sexual/romantic relationship\n\nin   1998,    Daniel    claims   that   Dressler    contacted   his   wife   and\n\ninformed her of their sexual relationship.            This call coupled with\n\nconstant calls and visits to Daniel at his place of business and\n\nhome were the foundation for the complaints to the police by\n\nDaniel.\n\n                                   III.\n\n              Dressler has not adduced evidence that would support a\n\ncausal connection between the initiation of a sexual harassment\n\naction against Daniel and Daniel's filing of police complaints\n\nagainst Dressler.         Therefore, the district court's order granting\n\nsummary judgment is affirmed.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f",

Dressler's claim can only survive if the evidence on the record could support a claim that Daniel's true motive for filing the complaints with the police department was Dressler's initiation of a sexual harassment claim in January 1997. <i>See Hoeppner,</i> 31 F.3d at 14; <i>Kearney,</i> 316 F.3d at 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court properly found that the close temporal proximity to support a finding of retaliation was lacking.

The adverse actions charged by Dressler occurred after this sexual/romantic relationship had ended. Two years had elapsed between the time Dressler engaged in the protected activity of initiating a sexual harassment complaint against Daniel and the time of the alleged adverse action, Daniel's filing of the police complaints against Dressler. The district court found &#8212; and we agree &#8212; that no \"reasonable trier of fact could conclude, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the 1999 complaints to the police were caused by the 1997 sexual harassment charge.\" Moreover, the inference of a causal connection becomes tenuous with the passage of time. <i>Lewis v.

In fact, the record suggests that the nature of the interactions between the parties was such that, as the district court wrote, \"events more recent than the discrimination charge were far more likely than the charge to have informed the state of the parties' relationship in March 1999.\" After the conclusion of the parties' sexual/romantic relationship in 1998, Daniel claims that Dressler contacted his wife and informed her of their sexual relationship.

Daniel (\"Daniel\") and Daniel's Pub, Inc. (\"Daniel's Pub\") (collectively \"employer\") on an action arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e, <i>et seq.</i> (\"Title VII\"). Dressler claims that she is the victim of retaliation by her former employer, after initiating a sexual harassment claim against Daniel. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3(a). Dressler asserts that due to the retaliatory actions taken by her former employer, she was denied future employment opportunities and subjected to a hostile work environment. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While attending college in 1988, Dressler met Daniel, and the two engaged in a relationship that Dressler alleges was non-sexual but romantic. There was little contact between Dressler and Daniel after their relationship ended until 1996, when Dressler moved to Henniker, New Hampshire and contacted Daniel. Thereafter, Dressler claims that she and Daniel engaged in a romantic, sexual relationship which lasted approximately two months. Dressler informed Daniel that the relationship would end in December 1996, after she accepted employment at his restaurant, Daniel's Pub.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Dressler worked at Daniel's Pub from December 15, 1996 to December 31, 1996, when she terminated her employment. Shortly thereafter, she contacted the New Hampshire Center for Human Rights to pursue charges of sexual harassment against Daniel. A negotiated settlement was reached between Dressler and the employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From July 1997 to September 1998, Dressler alleges that she and Daniel again engaged in a discreet romantic and sexual relationship. After the relationship ended, Dressler took a job as a planning room aide at Kearsarge Middle School (\"KMS\") in London, New Hampshire, where Daniel's daughter attended school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dressler quit her job at KMS in December 1998 contending that comments were broadcast in the school that subsequently affected her job responsibilities and work environment. A former co-worker at Daniel's Pub, who also worked at KMS, informed the Vice-Principal that there may be some concerns over the propriety of Dressler working with Daniel's daughter. The Vice-Principal stated that this comment had no impact on his evaluation of Dressler. Nothing in the evidence suggests that Daniel made any comments to KMS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While employed at KMS, Dressler applied for a position at the Equity Group in New London, New Hampshire. She attributed her rejection for employment at the Equity Group to statements made by Daniel to her prospective employer. James Ward, the owner of the Equity Group, attested in an affidavit that he contacted Daniel and recalls from his conversation with Daniel that \"the parting of ways [between Daniel's Pub and Dressler] was on somewhat less than favorable terms and this did not prevent me from hiring her, as there were other issues.\" Dressler claims that she was told by James Ward that he did not want claims filed against him. Daniel claims that he has never been asked to provide a reference concerning Dressler by a prospective or current employer and has not offered unsolicited information with respect to her qualifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1999, Daniel filed a complaint with the Henniker and Newbury Police Departments relating to a stalking charge he planned to file against Dressler. Daniel believed that statements to the police would not be public information but would serve investigatory purposes only. Dressler learned about the complaints in August 1999 when she was contacted by the police department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dressler filed an action in federal district court against appellees alleging violations of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e, <i>et seq.,</i> &#167; 1981 and/or &#167; 1981a, as well as pendent state law claims.

New Hampshire Dep't of Corr.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199974\"><a href=\"/opinion/199974/gorski-v-new-hampshire-depart/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 471 (1st Cir.2002). In fact, the record suggests that the nature of the interactions between the parties was such that, as the district court wrote, \"events more recent than the discrimination charge were far more likely than the charge to have informed the state of the parties' relationship in March 1999.\" After the conclusion of the parties' sexual/romantic relationship in 1998, Daniel claims that Dressler contacted his wife and informed her of their sexual relationship. This call coupled with constant calls and visits to Daniel at his place of business and home were the foundation for the complaints to the police by Daniel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dressler has not adduced evidence that would support a causal connection between the initiation of a sexual harassment action against Daniel and Daniel's filing of police complaints against Dressler. Therefore, the district court's order granting summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> The Honorable Betty B.
