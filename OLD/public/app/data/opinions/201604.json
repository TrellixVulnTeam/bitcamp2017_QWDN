Torres-\nPabón, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n                             May 27, 2005\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation.\n\f           LIPEZ,    Circuit   Judge.    Defendant-appellant    Luis   B.\n\nFornia-Castillo was indicted, tried, and convicted on a single\n\ncount of conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of\n\ncocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846.             He then sought to\n\ndismiss, on double jeopardy grounds, a second indictment charging\n\nhim with another count of conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. § 846 and four\n\nsubstantive counts of possession with intent to distribute in\n\nexcess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A), and aiding and abetting others in those\n\noffenses in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2.            After the government\n\ndismissed the second conspiracy count, the court denied Fornia's\n\nmotion to dismiss the second indictment.       Fornia then pled guilty\n\nto each of the four remaining substantive offense counts, expressly\n\nreserving his right to appeal those convictions on double jeopardy\n\ngrounds.   Fornia was sentenced in separate hearings to consecutive\n\nterms of 210 months' imprisonment for the conspiracy conviction and\n\n365 months' imprisonment for the four substantive counts (to run\n\nconcurrently to each other), for a total term of imprisonment of\n\napproximately   48   years.     Fornia   appeals   his   convictions   and\n\nsentences.\n\n           With respect to his conspiracy conviction, Fornia argues\n\nthat: (1) the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress\n\nevidence obtained in violation of his Fourth Amendment right to\n\nprotection against unreasonable searches and seizures and his Fifth\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fAmendment right to protection against self-incrimination; (2) his\n\npre-trial    counsel    rendered       constitutionally   defective\n\nrepresentation at his suppression hearing in violation of his Sixth\n\nAmendment right to effective assistance of counsel; and (3) the\n\ngovernment violated his Fifth Amendment right to indictment by a\n\ngrand jury by constructively amending the indictment after its\n\npresentment to the grand jury.     With respect to his pleas to the\n\nsubstantive offenses, Fornia argues that the prosecution was barred\n\nby the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment because the\n\ngovernment failed to exercise due diligence either by seeking a\n\nsuperseding indictment to the initial conspiracy charge or by\n\npromptly joining both cases for prosecution.1    Fornia also assigns\n\nnumerous errors to his sentences, including the claim that the\n\ncourt imposed mandatory sentence enhancements in each case based\n\nsolely on judicial fact-finding, thereby increasing the maximum\n\nsentence otherwise authorized by jury-found or admitted facts in\n\nviolation of United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. ___, 125 S. Ct. 738\n\n(2005).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Fornia raises a number of other claims with respect to his\nconvictions. We have considered them and find them to be either\nwithout merit or waived by his guilty plea in the second case, in\nwhich he reserved only his right to appeal on double jeopardy\ngrounds. See United States v. Rodriguez-Castillo, 350 F.3d 1, 3-4\n(1st Cir. 2003) (\"A defendant who subscribes an unconditional\nguilty plea is deemed to have waived virtually all claims arising\nout of garden-variety errors that may have antedated the plea.\").\n\n                                 -3-\n\f            After careful consideration of each of Fornia's claims,\n\ntested    against      the    record    on     appeal,   we     affirm      Fornia's\n\nconvictions.     Because we are not \"convinced that a lower sentence\n\nwould not have been imposed\" under a post-Booker, non-mandatory\n\nGuidelines regime, United States v. Vázquez-Rivera, No. 02-1818,\n\n2005 WL 1163672, at *10, ___ F.3d ___ (1st Cir. May 18, 2005), we\n\nvacate all of the sentences and remand both cases for resentencing.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n            We recount the facts, consistent with record support, in\n\nthe light most favorable to the jury's guilty verdict on the\n\nconspiracy charge, United States v. Gonzalez-Maldonado, 115 F.3d 9,\n\n12 (1st Cir. 1997), and as found by the district court after a\n\nsuppression hearing, United States v. Ngai Man Lee, 317 F.3d 26, 30\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).       We reserve further details for our analysis of\n\nFornia's individual claims.\n\n            On the afternoon of September 9, 1999, Drug Enforcement\n\nAdministration      (\"DEA\")     Task    Force     agents      conducting     visual\n\nsurveillance of suspected drug conspirators outside a furniture\n\nstore witnessed several people entering and exiting the store with\n\nsmall    boxes   and   bags    that    the    agents   had    reason   to    believe\n\ncontained illegal drugs or drug proceeds.2                   Later that day, two\n\n\n     2\n      The agents' suspicions were based in part on wiretap\nsurveillance of individuals with known histories of involvement in\ndrug activity and the seizure of plastic wrapping materials found\nin the garbage outside the furniture store that tested positive for\ncocaine residue.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fsuspects left the store carrying a large bag, which they placed in\n\nthe trunk of a car.   Agents followed the two men as they drove the\n\ncar from the furniture store to a bakery, where they met a third\n\nman unknown to the agents, who was later identified as Fornia. The\n\nagents observed the men transferring the contents of the car trunk\n\nto the trunk of Fornia's car, and began following Fornia as he\n\ndrove away from the bakery alone.\n\n          At around 7:45 PM, agents instructed a member of the Task\n\nForce who was a local police officer in uniform to pull Fornia over\n\nunder the pretense of investigating a report of a car stolen from\n\na nearby shopping center whose description matched Fornia's car.\n\nAfter identifying Fornia through his driver's license and car\n\nregistration, the officer obtained Fornia's consent to search the\n\ncar, including a garbage bag in the trunk, which contained several\n\nsmaller bags and a shoe box, all filled with large amounts of cash.\n\nOnce the officer saw the cash, he handcuffed Fornia and frisked\n\nhim, finding no weapon.3   While Fornia was handcuffed, the officer\n\nsignaled for assistance from two local police officers who were not\n\npart of the Task Force but who happened to be patrolling the area.\n\nFornia remained handcuffed until another Task Force member arrived\n\non the scene, pretending to be another police officer in charge of\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      As we discuss in Part II.A, the officer also drew his gun in\na defensive posture, out of Fornia's sight, as a safety precaution\nwhile Fornia opened the bag in the trunk.\n\n                                -5-\n\fsecurity at the shopping center parking lot, and ordered the\n\nhandcuffs removed.\n\n           The newly arrived agent informed Fornia that the money\n\nwould have to be turned over either to the tax authorities, who\n\nwould take the cash, deduct a portion, and return the remainder to\n\nFornia by check, or, in the alternative, to the DEA.   Fornia stated\n\nseveral times that he would prefer to turn the money over to the\n\ntax authorities, observing that their procedure resembled money\n\nlaundering.    Instead, the officers awaited the arrival of DEA\n\nagents, all of whom were members of the Task Force investigating\n\nthe suspected drug conspiracy.    When the DEA agents arrived, they\n\ntold Fornia that he was not under arrest for carrying a large\n\nquantity of cash.    The agents questioned Fornia about his recent\n\nwhereabouts and asked where he was going with the large amount of\n\ncash.   Fornia did not mention that he had been at the bakery, but\n\nreplied that he had bought coffee at the shopping center and that\n\nhe was bringing the money to his mother-in-law's house to be\n\nstored.   The agents then seized the money and asked Fornia to go to\n\nthe DEA office for further questioning.     Fornia agreed and drove\n\nhis own car to the DEA office, where he answered additional\n\nquestions.    Fornia was then given a receipt for the cash and left\n\nthe DEA office.\n\n           On April 26, 2000, a federal grand jury returned a sealed\n\nindictment (\"I96\") charging 26 named individuals, including Fornia,\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fand unknown co-conspirators with a solitary count of conspiracy to\n\ndistribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of\n\n21 U.S.C. § 846 during a time period beginning \"not later than the\n\nsummer of 1997\" and continuing through the date of the indictment.\n\nThe   indictment    assigned     each    named   individual      a    number    and\n\ndescribed his or her alleged role within the conspiracy.                     Fornia,\n\n#21, was included among #16-23 as \"transporters of drug[s] or\n\nmoney.\"4      The   indictment   also     alleged   74   overt       acts,    \"among\n\nothers,\" committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. Fornia's name\n\nappeared only once in the list of overt acts, in paragraph 50,\n\nwhich alleged that \"[o]n September 9, 1999, (2) Fernando TORRES-\n\nFernandez and (20) Osvaldo VILLEGAS-Rivera delivered to (21) Luis\n\nFORNIA-Castillo approximately Two Hundred Eighty-One Thousand and\n\nNine Hundred Twenty-Six Dollars ($281,926.00) of drug proceeds\"\n\n(emphasis omitted).\n\n           The indictment was unsealed on May 1, 2000, and Fornia\n\nwas arrested on a warrant that day.           He was later released on bail.\n\nOn December 27, 2000, Fornia moved to suppress the evidence,\n\nincluding his statements, obtained as a result of the September 9,\n\n1999 stop and search of his car and his subsequent interview at the\n\nDEA office.    After an evidentiary hearing before Judge Casellas on\n\n\n      4\n      The other named individuals were described in order as \"head\nand owner drug point\" (#1), \"sources of supply\" (#2-4),\n\"supervisors/managers\" (#5-7), \"assistants\" (#8-15), \"counter\nsurveillance\" (#24), and \"preparers and packagers of drugs\" (#25-\n26).\n\n                                        -7-\n\fFebruary 5-6, 2001, the motion was denied.5   By March 2001, each of\n\nFornia's 25 co-defendants in I96 had pled guilty.\n\n          On August 1, 2001, a federal grand jury returned a sealed\n\nindictment (\"I528\") charging 15 named individuals, including Fornia\n\nand one other person who had also been indicted in I96,6 and others\n\nunknown, with conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms\n\nof cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846 during a time period\n\nbeginning \"on or about the end part of 1996\" and continuing through\n\nthe date of the indictment.   As in I96, all of the conduct alleged\n\nagainst Fornia in I528 took place no earlier than \"the summer of\n\n1997.\"   I528 identified Fornia as #1, \"owner of drugs.\"7       The\n\nindictment also charged Fornia with four additional counts alleging\n\nsubstantive offenses in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and\n\n841(b)(1)(A), and aiding and abetting others in those offenses in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2.    The substantive offenses were also\n\n\n     5\n      Fornia filed a motion to reopen his suppression hearing on\nJanuary 18, 2002, in order to supplement the record with facts\nrelating to his interrogation at the DEA office.      Judge Hornby\n(sitting by designation) denied the motion to reopen because \"[t]he\ntranscript of the [suppression motion] hearing fully supports the\nfindings that Judge Casellas made\" and because he concluded, based\non an independent review of the record, that the evidence should\nnot be suppressed.\n     6\n      Osvaldo Villegas-Rivera was named in I96 as #20,            a\n\"transporter,\" and in I528 as #3, a \"source[] of supply.\"\n     7\n      The other named individuals were identified as \"sources of\nsupply\" (#2-5), \"narcotics transporter[]\" (#6), \"drug distributors\nin [] their respective distribution area or drug point\" (#7-12),\nand \"assistants in receiving and delivering money or drug[s]\" (#13-\n15).\n\n                                -8-\n\falleged as overt acts #4-6 and #10 committed in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy charged in Count One.\n\n           Specifically, Count Two alleged that Fornia, indicted co-\n\nconspirators #2 and #6, and an unindicted co-conspirator possessed\n\nwith intent to distribute approximately 50 kilograms of cocaine\n\n\"[o]n or about the end part of 1997.\"       Count Three alleged that\n\nFornia, the same indicted co-conspirators, and an unindicted co-\n\nconspirator possessed with intent to distribute the same quantity\n\nof cocaine \"[o]n or about the beginning of 1998.\"          Count Four\n\nalleged that Fornia, indicted co-conspirator #3, and an unindicted\n\nco-conspirator possessed with intent to distribute approximately 40\n\nkilograms of cocaine \"[o]n or about August[] 1999,\" and Count Five\n\nalleged that Fornia and an unindicted co-conspirator possessed with\n\nintent to distribute approximately 30 kilograms of cocaine \"[o]n or\n\nabout    October[]   1999.\"8   Additional   overt   acts   alleged   in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy included three instances of drug-\n\nrelated payments, including an expanded version of paragraph 50 of\n\nI96 alleging that \"[o]n September 9, 1999, . . . OSVALDO VILLEGAS\n\nRIVERA[] and an unindicted coconspirator delivered to . . . LUIS B.\n\nFORNIA-CASTILLO approximately $281,926.00 of drug proceeds, money\n\nrelated to over[t] acts Nos. 6 and 7 herein\" (emphasis omitted).\n\n\n\n     8\n      The unindicted co-conspirator in Counts Three, Four, and Five\nturned out to be Fernando Torres-Fernandez, who was indicted in I96\nas co-conspirator #2, and who testified against Fornia at his trial\nin I96 after pleading guilty.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fThe money was also related to the facts alleged in support of the\n\nsubstantive offense charged in Count Three. Fornia was arrested on\n\nthe second set of charges on August 30, 2001 and held without bail.\n\n           On April 15, 2002, more than eight months later and\n\nduring the week when Fornia's jury trial in I96 was scheduled to\n\nbegin before Judge Carter (who was sitting by designation), the\n\ngovernment moved at a pre-trial status conference, over Fornia's\n\nobjection, to consolidate I96 and I528 for trial and sentencing.9\n\nJudge Carter denied the motion, stating: \"We are going to try this\n\ncase.\"    In a written motion filed the next day upon the court's\n\ninstruction, the government explained its reasons for seeking\n\njoinder   and   for   seeking   a   second   indictment   instead   of   a\n\nsuperseding indictment in I96:10\n\n           The counts contained in both indictment[s]\n           could have been joined in the same indictment\n           since they are of the same or similar\n           character pursuant to Fed. R. Crim P. 8(a).\n           However, since [by] August 1, 2001, [the date\n           on which the second indictment was returned,]\n           all the codefendants with the exception of\n           codefendant Luis B. Fornia-Castillo in [I96]\n           had already pled guilty[,] the government\n           elected to file a separate indictment against\n           fourteen (14) additional codefendants in lieu\n           of supersed[ing] the indictment in [I96].\n\n\n\n     9\n      The government filed a similar motion in I528, pending before\nJudge Pérez-Giménez, which was \"noticed\" on or about April 23,\n2002.\n     10\n      The government's motion contained no explanation of why the\ngovernment did not seek joinder of the cases during the eight-and-\na-half-month period between August 1, 2001 and April 15, 2002.\n\n                                    -10-\n\f            Fornia's trial in I96 began two days later, on April 18,\n\n2002, and continued for five days.     The government's first witness\n\nwas a member of the DEA Task Force who described the events\n\ndepicted on a surveillance videotape, including the arrival and\n\ndeparture of suspected co-conspirators at the furniture store on\n\nSeptember 9, 1999, the two co-conspirators' rendezvous with Fornia\n\nat the bakery, and the subsequent discovery of the bags of cash in\n\nFornia's trunk by investigators during the stop and search of his\n\ncar.\n\n            The government then called an indicted co-conspirator,\n\nFernando Torres-Fernandez,    who   had   pled    guilty   in   I96,    as   a\n\ncooperating witness.   Torres testified that sometime in late 1997,\n\nFornia asked him if he had any contacts at the airport who could\n\nassist in shipping cocaine to New York.          According to Torres, he\n\nand two other co-conspirators then met with Fornia to arrange a\n\ntest shipment of 50 kilograms of cocaine to New York.11                Torres\n\ntestified that when the test shipment, which also involved a fifth\n\nindividual who worked at the local airport, proved successful, the\n\nsame group of four co-conspirators arranged a second shipment of\n\nmore than 50 kilograms of cocaine to New York.12                The second\n\n\n       11\n      This event was also alleged as both a substantive count\n(Count Two) in I528 and as an overt act in furtherance of the\nconspiracy (Count One) charged in that indictment.\n       12\n      This event was also alleged as both a substantive count\n(Count Three) in I528 and as an overt act in furtherance of the\nconspiracy (Count One) charged in that indictment.\n\n                                -11-\n\fshipment, however, never arrived at its destination, according to\n\nTorres, because the airport worker had been killed and the cocaine\n\nlost.     Torres testified that the four co-conspirators had gone to\n\nthe airport several times to try to find the killer.\n\n             During   Torres'   testimony,   Fornia's   counsel    objected\n\nseveral times on hearsay grounds to Torres' reports of statements\n\nmade by other alleged co-conspirators.        After one such objection,\n\nthe court took judicial notice of the indictment in I528, which was\n\npending before Judge Pérez-Giménez.          Because the events Torres\n\ndescribed were alleged only in I528, and the co-conspirators to\n\nwhom Torres referred were indicted only in I528, the court asked\n\nthe government whether it could show that the co-conspirators were\n\nalso participants in the conspiracy charged in I96 for purposes of\n\nadmitting their hearsay statements.          The court then asked: \"Why\n\nhave you indicted in two separate indictments, alleging in the\n\nindictment all of these transactions in case number 528, and now\n\nyou are proving those acts and transactions in a separate case,\n\nthis one bearing number 96.      I don't understand what you are trying\n\nto do.\"    The government responded that \"at the time [I96 and I528]\n\nwere indicted, they were separate conspirac[ies].\"13              The court\n\n\n     13\n      As we have noted, the government had earlier acknowledged in\nits motion to consolidate the cases for trial and sentencing that\nwhile it had obtained separate indictments, I96 and I528 were \"of\nthe same or similar character pursuant to Fed. R. Crim P. 8(a).\"\nThe government did not specify the features that made the two\nconspiracies \"similar.\"     According to the indictments, the\nconspiracies in I96 and I528 involved overlapping time periods,\n\n                                   -12-\n\fwarned, \"You can't convict the same defendant two times [for the\n\nsame conspiracy].\"      The court then permitted the government to\n\nproceed   with   its   direct   examination   of   Torres,   advising   the\n\ngovernment that it would not admit co-conspirator hearsay \"until\n\nyou tell me that you can connect those co-conspirators to this\n\nconspiracy and not just to the other [one in I528].\"\n\n           Torres next testified that on September 9, 1999, he had\n\ncollected money from several people in order to pay Fornia for\n\nabout 40 kilograms of cocaine Torres had purchased from him at a\n\nprice of $13,000 per kilogram.        Torres testified that the cash\n\nseized from Fornia later that same day represented partial payment\n\nfor the drugs after successful resale.14       Torres also identified a\n\npaper bag and a shoe box that had been used to hold the cash, and\n\n\noverlapping participants, and the same objective of distributing\nand \"possess[ing] with intent to distribute\" cocaine \"for\nsignificant financial gain or profit.\"        See United States v.\nPortela, 167 F.3d 687, 695 (1st Cir. 1999) (determination whether\nconspiracies are separate depends on totality of the circumstances,\nincluding   factors   such   as   existence    of  a   common goal,\ninterdependence   among    participants,    and   degree   to which\nparticipants overlap); United States v. Morris, 99 F.3d 476, 480\n(1st Cir. 1996) (using \"five-part test for determining whether two\nconspiracies are synonymous for double jeopardy purposes,\" which\ninquires whether conspiracies \"took place contemporaneously (or\nnearly so),\" \"involved essentially the same personnel,\" \"occurred\nat much the same places,\" are proven by the same evidence, and \"are\npremised\" on the same statutory provision).\n     14\n      Fornia's receipt of drug proceeds from Torres and a co-\nconspirator indicted in both I96 and I528 constituted the only\novert act alleged against him in I96. The same incident was also\nalleged as both a substantive count (Count Four) in I528 and as an\novert act in furtherance of the conspiracy (Count One) charged in\nthat indictment.\n\n                                   -13-\n\fidentified his handwriting on the containers recording the amount\n\nof cash held in each.    Torres went on to state that on September\n\n10, 1999, Fornia had informed him that the cash had been seized by\n\nthe DEA the previous day, but that Fornia planned to recover the\n\ncash through a suppression motion or by characterizing the money as\n\nproceeds from his legal motorcycle business. Torres then described\n\nnew installment payment procedures Fornia devised for receiving\n\nfuture payments in order to avoid the possibility of any additional\n\nseizures of large amounts of cash.      Finally, Torres described one\n\nadditional incident that took place after September 9, 1999, in\n\nwhich Fornia supplied him with about 30 kilograms of cocaine.15\n\n          After the government rested its case, Fornia moved for an\n\nacquittal.    His counsel stated that\n\n          because   this   case  .   .   .  involved   a\n          conspiratorial time period that would overlap\n          with [I528], it appears that the evidence that\n          has been brought here is partially from [I528]\n          and . . . because of that, I don't know how we\n          can decide whether this particular conspiracy\n          has been set forth with all of the elements.\n\nThe court asked the government how, in the event Fornia was\n\nconvicted in I96, he would \"prove[] in the other court that he has\n\nalready been convicted of the same conduct that he is charged with\n\n[in I528]?\"    In response, the government continued to assert that\n\nthe conspiracy alleged in I528 was different from the one for which\n\n\n     15\n      This incident was also alleged as both a substantive count\n(Count Five) in I528 and as an overt act in furtherance of the\nconspiracy (Count One) charged in that indictment.\n\n                                -14-\n\fFornia was being tried in I96. Eventually, however, the government\n\nrepresented that it would request dismissal of the conspiracy count\n\nagainst Fornia in I528.\n\n          On April 24, 2002, the jury found Fornia guilty of\n\nconspiracy and found that the quantity of cocaine involved in the\n\noffense exceeded five kilograms.     On April 26, 2002, Fornia moved\n\nfor a new trial alleging that \"the government's failure to provide\n\nrequired pretrial disclosure materially prejudiced [his] right to\n\na fair trial\" and that \"by falsely indicting and prosecuting\n\n[Fornia] for two conspiracies when it knew there was only one, the\n\ngovernment deprived [him] of a fair trial.\"           On June 6, 2002,\n\nFornia also moved in I96 to \"confirm consolidation\" of his cases on\n\nthe ground    that,   inter alia,   they   involved   the   same   alleged\n\nconspiracy.    The government opposed Fornia's motion to confirm\n\nconsolidation of the cases, arguing that: (1) consolidation had\n\nalready been denied; (2) \"no substantial public interest [would] be\n\npromoted\" by consolidation \"[a]t this stage of the proceedings\";\n\nand (3) Fornia was estopped from seeking consolidation or had\n\nwaived the claim because he had opposed the government's earlier\n\nmotion, filed on the eve of trial, to consolidate the cases.            On\n\nJune 25, 2002, Judge Carter denied both Fornia's motion for a new\n\ntrial and his motion to confirm consolidation of the cases, noting\n\nthat any double jeopardy concerns could adequately be addressed by\n\nJudge Pérez-Giménez in I528.\n\n\n                                -15-\n\f          On July 1, 2002, Fornia filed a motion to dismiss I528 on\n\ndouble jeopardy grounds. As promised, the government dismissed the\n\nconspiracy count against Fornia in I528 on July 3, 2002.               Fornia\n\nthen moved in I528 for a change of plea.16         At the change-of-plea\n\nhearing on July 15, 2002, Judge Pérez-Giménez denied Fornia's\n\nmotion to dismiss I528.        Fornia then pled guilty to the four\n\nremaining counts charging him with substantive drug offenses.\n\nAlthough Fornia did not enter into a plea agreement with the\n\ngovernment,   he   expressly    reserved     the   right   to    appeal    his\n\nconviction in I528 on double jeopardy grounds, citing Menna v. New\n\nYork, 423 U.S. 61, 62-63 (1975) (per curiam) (guilty plea does not\n\nautomatically waive double jeopardy claim).\n\n          On October 8, 2002, Judge Carter recused himself from\n\nsentencing, and the case was reassigned to Judge Pérez-Giménez.\n\nFornia moved in I528 to consolidate both cases for sentencing on\n\nOctober 25, 2002, but Judge Pérez-Giménez denied the motion.                On\n\nthe morning of December 5, 2002, Judge Pérez-Giménez sentenced\n\nFornia in I96 to 210 months' imprisonment.          That afternoon, in a\n\nseparate sentencing hearing, the court sentenced Fornia in I528 to\n\n365 months'   imprisonment     to   run    concurrently    as   to   the   four\n\nsubstantive counts, but consecutive to the sentence in I96. Fornia\n\ntimely appealed his convictions and his sentences.\n\n\n\n     16\n      By July 2, 2002, each of Fornia's 14 co-defendants in I528\nhad also pled guilty.\n\n                                    -16-\n\f                    II. I96 CONSPIRACY CONVICTION\n\nA.          Suppression of Evidence\n\n            1.     Validity of Consent to Search\n\n            We construe Fornia's Fourth Amendment claim, which he\n\nraises in a pro se brief, as a renewal of his challenge to the\n\nvoluntariness of his consent to the search of the bag in his car\n\ntrunk.     See United States v. Weidul, 325 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (consent to a warrantless search \"must be voluntary to be\n\nvalid\").    Fornia alleges that his consent was invalid because it\n\nwas coerced by the police officer's drawing of his gun after Fornia\n\nopened the car trunk, requiring suppression of the bags of cash\n\ncontained within the larger bag in the trunk.      \"Typically, whether\n\nconsent is voluntary turns on questions of fact, determinable from\n\nthe totality of the circumstances.     For that reason, a finding of\n\nvoluntary consent (other than one based on an erroneous legal\n\nstandard) is reviewable only for clear error, and the trial court's\n\ncredibility determinations ordinarily must be respected.\"      United\n\nStates v. Romain, 393 F.3d 63, 69 (1st Cir. 2004) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n            During the suppression hearing, Officer Alverio, the\n\npolice officer who initially stopped Fornia, testified that after\n\nFornia consented to a search of the car and opened the trunk to\n\nreveal a large bag, he asked Fornia if he would mind opening the\n\nbag.   When Fornia began to open the bag, Officer Alverio testified\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fthat he drew his gun in a \"defensive position\" -- out of Fornia's\n\nvisual range and pointing at the ground -- because it was too dark\n\nfor him to be able to see whether the trunk contained any weapons.\n\nThe    district    court    determined    that     Officer      Alverio    \"provided\n\ncredible undisputed testimony that Fornia voluntarily agreed to\n\nallow him to search the vehicle and to examine the trunk.\"17                        The\n\ncourt specifically found that the officer \"kept [the gun] out of\n\nFornia's view[] and at his side, and placed it back in his holster\n\nwhen    Fornia    stepped   away   from    the    trunk,     all    of    which    were\n\nconfirmed by the [surveillance] video\" played during the hearing.\n\nThe court further found that \"the video shows Fornia willingly\n\nreach[ing] in to the open trunk of the vehicle and open[ing] the\n\nbags containing the money.\"\n\n            Because    \"the    evidence        presented   at      the   suppression\n\nhearing fairly supports\" the district court's factual findings,\n\nUnited States v. Laine, 270 F.3d 71, 75 (1st Cir. 2001), the\n\ndistrict    court    committed     no   clear     error    in   determining        that\n\nFornia's consent to the search of the car trunk was valid.                        Based\n\n\n\n\n       17\n      Fornia maintains on appeal that, as depicted on the video,\nhe looked back at Officer Alverio before opening the bag, and that\nhe saw the gun at that moment and felt he had no choice but to\ncontinue opening the bag.     Fornia did not testify during the\nsuppression hearing in order to present his version of events. In\nall events, \"a district court's choice between two plausible\ncompeting interpretations of the facts cannot be clearly\nerroneous.\" Weidul, 325 F.3d at 53.\n\n                                        -18-\n\fon those findings, the court properly denied Fornia's motion to\n\nsuppress the evidence obtained during the stop.\n\n             2.       Miranda Claim\n\n             Fornia argues that the statements he made during his\n\nentire encounter with the Task Force agents, including those made\n\nat the DEA office, should have been suppressed because he was\n\nsubjected to custodial interrogation without first being advised of\n\nhis Miranda rights, in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to\n\nprotection against self-incrimination.            See Dickerson v. United\n\nStates, 530 U.S. 428, 435 (2000) (failure to give required Miranda\n\nwarnings amounts to Fifth Amendment violation).18 \"Miranda warnings\n\nmust    be   given    before   a   suspect   is   subjected   to   custodial\n\ninterrogation.\"       United States v. Ventura, 85 F.3d 708, 710 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).       By contrast, \"[a]s a general rule, Terry stops do not\n\nimplicate the requirements of Miranda.\" United States v. Streifel,\n\n781 F.2d 953, 958 (1st Cir. 1986).19          This is so \"because 'Terry\n\n\n\n       18\n      Miranda warnings inform a suspect that he \"has the right to\nremain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a\ncourt of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney,\nand that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for\nhim prior to any questioning if he so desires.\"       Dickerson v.\nUnited States, 530 U.S. 428, 435 (2000) (quoting Miranda v.\nArizona, 384 U.S. 436, 479 (1966)).\n       19\n      Pursuant to Terry v. Ohio, a warrantless investigatory stop\ncomports with the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable\nsearches and seizures if it is justified by more than an\n\"inarticulate hunch[]\" and is \"reasonably related in scope to the\ncircumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\"\n392 U.S. 1, 22, 20 (1968).\n\n                                      -19-\n\fstops, though inherently somewhat coercive, do not usually involve\n\nthe    type    of     police   dominated        or    compelling       atmosphere      which\n\nnecessitates Miranda warnings.'\"                     Id. (quoting United States v.\n\nBautista,       684    F.2d    1286,     1291    (9th     Cir.        1982)).     A   valid\n\ninvestigatory stop may nevertheless escalate into custody, thereby\n\ntriggering the need for Miranda warnings, where the totality of the\n\ncircumstances shows that a reasonable person would understand that\n\nhe was being held to \"the degree associated with a formal arrest,\"\n\nStansbury v. California, 511 U.S. 318, 322 (1994) (per curiam)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).                    Relevant factors bearing on\n\nwhether an investigatory stop has evolved into a de facto arrest\n\ninclude \"whether the suspect was questioned in familiar or at least\n\nneutral    surroundings,         the   number        of   law    enforcement      officers\n\npresent at the scene, the degree of physical restraint placed upon\n\nthe suspect, and the duration and character of the interrogation.\"\n\nVentura, 85 F.3d at 711 (internal quotation marks omitted).                           While\n\nwe    review    the    court's    factual       findings        for    clear    error,   the\n\nultimate       conclusion      whether    a     seizure     is    a     de   facto    arrest\n\n\"qualifies for independent review\" because it presents a \"mixed\n\nquestion of law and fact.\"             United States v. Trueber, 238 F.3d 79,\n\n91, 93 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U.S. 99,\n\n113 (1995)).\n\n               During the suppression hearing, Officer Alverio testified\n\nthat once he saw the large quantity of cash contained in the bags\n\n\n                                          -20-\n\fin Fornia's car trunk, he re-holstered his weapon and handcuffed\n\nand frisked Fornia because he was the sole law enforcement officer\n\non the scene, and, in his personal experience, people who may be\n\ntraveling with large quantities of drug proceeds may also be armed\n\nor may travel with armed escorts.             Officer Alverio explained that\n\nhe did not remove the handcuffs even after the local police\n\nofficers arrived on the scene to assist him because he did not know\n\nthe officers.\n\n             Fornia argues that the totality of the circumstances\n\nestablishes that the stop of his car, while initially a valid\n\ninvestigatory stop, escalated into a de facto arrest triggering the\n\nneed for Miranda warnings.          Fornia maintains that the combination\n\nof the officer's display of a gun, his use of handcuffs and a pat-\n\ndown search, and his explanation that he was investigating a car\n\ntheft     would   have   led   a   reasonable    person   to   believe   he   was\n\neffectively under arrest.20          In particular, Fornia argues that he\n\nwas subjected to custodial interrogation because Officer Alverio\n\nquestioned him while he was handcuffed.             Indeed, Officer Alverio\n\ntestified during the suppression hearing that he asked Fornia where\n\nthe money in his trunk had come from while Fornia was handcuffed,\n\nand that Fornia responded that the money was from his motorcycle\n\n\n     20\n      At the suppression hearing, Officer Alverio himself used the\nword \"arrest\" to describe his restraint of Fornia during the stop\nof his car. However, Officer Alverio clarified that he restrained\nFornia only for safety purposes and not because he was arresting\nFornia for a crime.\n\n                                       -21-\n\fbusiness.   While the government did not introduce this particular\n\nstatement at trial, Fornia maintains that the statements he made\n\nafter the handcuffs were removed in response to questioning by\n\nother Task Force agents should have been suppressed because they\n\nwere derived from the same Miranda violation. See United States v.\n\nByram, 145 F.3d 405, 409-10 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"where the Miranda\n\nviolation is not merely technical, where there is a substantial\n\nnexus between the violation and the second statement, and where the\n\nsecond statement is not itself preceded by an adequate Miranda\n\nwarning,\" suppression of subsequent voluntary statements may be\n\nwarranted).\n\n            The    district    court     concluded    that   Fornia    was   not\n\nsubjected to custodial interrogation at any time during the stop\n\nand therefore that no Miranda violation occurred.                     The court\n\nrecognized \"two arguably coercive facts\" in support of Fornia's\n\nMiranda violation claims: Officer Alverio's drawing of his gun and\n\nhis use of handcuffs.          As the court correctly noted, however,\n\nneither   the     use   of   handcuffs    nor   the   drawing   of    a   weapon\n\nnecessarily transforms a valid Terry stop into a de facto arrest.\n\nTrueber, 238 F.3d at 94 (officer's drawing of weapon while asking\n\nsuspected narcotics trafficker to step out of vehicle at night does\n\nnot transform entire investigatory stop into de facto arrest);\n\nUnited States v. Acosta-Colon, 157 F.3d 9, 18 (1st Cir. 1998) (the\n\n\"use of handcuffs in the course of an investigatory stop does not\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fautomatically convert the encounter into a de facto arrest\").                         As\n\nthe court had previously found, Officer Alverio briefly drew his\n\nweapon out of Fornia's view and for defensive purposes only.\n\nSimilarly, based on Officer Alverio's testimony, the district court\n\nfound that \"reasonable safety concerns permeated the [officer's]\n\ndecision to use [handcuffs].\"\n\n            While     an   officer's      drawing     of    his    gun   and    use   of\n\nhandcuffs might in some situations weigh more heavily in favor of\n\na finding that a detention has escalated into a de facto arrest,\n\nthe district court found that numerous other factors weighed\n\nagainst such a determination in Fornia's case.                     Specifically, the\n\ncourt observed that the stop took place at the side of \"a busy\n\npublic street with a heavy volume of traffic,\" and that, initially,\n\nOfficer Alverio \"was the only officer on the scene.\"                     In addition,\n\nthe court     found    that   \"the    handcuffs       were    removed     when   other\n\nsurveillance team members arrived, and only remained on [Fornia]\n\nfor ten or fifteen minutes.\"              Finally, the court noted that \"the\n\ninteraction    between      the   .   .    .     officers    and    Fornia     was    not\n\nconfrontational or bellicose.\"\n\n            These factual findings were not clearly erroneous. Based\n\non these findings, the court supportably came to the ultimate\n\nconclusion that Fornia's detention was a valid investigatory stop\n\nthat did not require Miranda warnings.                While a reasonable person\n\nin Fornia's situation would certainly have understood that he was\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\funder investigation for a crime, the stop, given the facts as found\n\nby the district court, \"lacked the coercive element necessary to\n\nconvert it into something more draconian,\" based on the totality of\n\nthe circumstances.          Ngai Man Lee, 317 F.3d at 32.             The district\n\ncourt        thus   properly   denied   Fornia's      motion    to   suppress   his\n\nstatements on the ground that they were obtained as a result of a\n\nviolation of his Fifth Amendment right to protection against self-\n\nincrimination.\n\nB.              Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n                In his pro se brief, Fornia claims that he was deprived\n\nof his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel at\n\nhis suppression hearing.           Under the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668                (1984), to establish such\n\na    violation,       \"a   defendant    must   show    that    counsel   performed\n\nunreasonably and that prejudice resulted therefrom.\" United States\n\nv. Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d 1026, 1034 (1st Cir. 1993).                   Fornia alleges\n\nthat his pre-trial counsel performed deficiently by denying him the\n\nopportunity to exercise his constitutional right to testify at his\n\nsuppression hearing, which resulted in the denial of his motion to\n\nsuppress evidence.21\n\n\n\n\n        21\n      Fornia specifically notes that if he had been able to testify\nat the suppression hearing, he would have described the\nconversation he had with the two men he met at the bakery, which\nwas recorded without sound on the government's surveillance\nvideotape.\n\n                                        -24-\n\f            The   record   on   appeal,       however,   is   devoid   of   facts\n\nrelating to Fornia's interactions with counsel, including whether\n\ncounsel informed Fornia of his right to testify at his suppression\n\nhearing, informed him of the constitutional nature of that right,\n\nor somehow coerced him into forgoing the exercise of that right.\n\nSee Lema v. United States, 987 F.2d 48, 52-53 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(discussing considerations for determining whether defense counsel\n\ncoerced or merely advised client regarding decision whether to\n\ntestify). Because the record is insufficiently developed to permit\n\n\"reasoned   consideration       of   the   ineffective    assistance    claim,\"\n\nUnited States v. Glenn, 389 F.3d 283, 287 (1st Cir. 2004), Fornia\n\nmay raise such a claim only on collateral attack in a proceeding\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.         See United States v. Genao, 281 F.3d\n\n305, 313 (1st Cir. 2002).            We therefore dismiss his ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claim without prejudice to the filing of a §\n\n2255 petition.\n\nC.          Constructive Amendment/Prejudicial Variance\n\n            Fornia alleges that the government constructively amended\n\nthe indictment in I96 by introducing evidence of the conspiracy\n\nalleged in I528 to prove the conspiracy charged in I96 -- in\n\neffect, trying him for an offense other than that alleged in I96 --\n\nin violation of his Fifth Amendment right to presentment of charges\n\nto a grand jury.     The government argues that Fornia has forfeited\n\nhis claim of constructive amendment through failure to object to\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fthe   introduction    of    evidence   on    that    ground    or    to    seek   a\n\ncontinuance or mistrial below.           As we have explained, however,\n\nafter the government rested its case, Fornia's counsel moved for an\n\nacquittal on the ground that the conspiracy the government had\n\nattempted to prove in I96 was indistinguishable from that charged\n\nin I528 and that the evidence was therefore insufficient to prove\n\nthe conspiracy charged in I96.           In his motion for a new trial,\n\nFornia also argued that he had been prejudiced at trial by the\n\ngovernment's    failure     to   clarify     which    of     the    two    charged\n\nconspiracies it was attempting to prove in I96.              Fornia's claim is\n\nthus preserved.\n\n            The Presentment Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides\n\nthat \"[n]o person shall be held to answer for a capital, or\n\notherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of\n\na   Grand   Jury\"   (with   exceptions      not   relevant    to    this    case).\n\nAccordingly, \"after an indictment has been returned[,] its charges\n\nmay not be broadened through amendment except by the grand jury\n\nitself.\"    Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 215-16 (1960)\n\n(citing Ex Parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1 (1887)).           An indictment has been\n\nconstructively amended in violation of the Presentment Clause \"when\n\nthe charging terms of the indictment are altered, either literally\n\nor in effect, by prosecution or court after the grand jury has last\n\npassed upon them.\"     United States v. Fisher, 3 F.3d 456, 462 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).                  Such\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\fan amendment may occur through the \"admission of evidence of an\n\noffense not charged by the grand jury.\"                 United States v. Dunn, 758\n\nF.2d 30, 35 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\n           Fornia argues specifically that the government tried him\n\nfor the offense of participating in a conspiracy in which he was an\n\n\"owner of drugs,\" as charged in I528, as opposed to the conspiracy\n\ncharged in I96, in which he was identified as a \"transporter[] of\n\ndrug[s] or money\" and another individual was identified as the only\n\n\"head and owner drug point.\"               However, the statutory offense\n\ncharged against Fornia in I96, and the offense the government\n\nproved at trial, was conspiracy to distribute in excess of five\n\nkilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846.                   Role in the\n\nconspiracy is not an element of that offense. Thus, Fornia's claim\n\ndoes not involve an alleged constructive amendment of I96 to\n\ninclude \"an offense not charged by the grand jury,\" Dunn, 758 F.2d\n\nat 35, but rather an alleged variance from the indictment, which\n\n\"occurs when the charging terms remain unchanged but when the facts\n\nproved    at     trial   are   different         from     those   alleged   in   the\n\nindictment,\" Fisher, 3 F.3d at 463.\n\n           Though related, claims of constructive amendment and\n\nprejudicial variance differ in at least one important respect.                   \"A\n\nconstructive amendment is considered prejudicial per se and grounds\n\nfor reversal of a conviction.\"             Id.     By contrast, \"[v]ariance is\n\ngrounds    for     reversal    only   if     it     affected      the   defendant's\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\fsubstantial rights.\"         Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).                      In\n\nshort, \"[s]o long as the statutory violation remains the same, the\n\njury can convict even if the facts found are somewhat different\n\nthan those charged -- so long as the difference does not cause\n\nunfair prejudice.\"         United States v. Twitty, 72 F.3d 228, 231 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n             Fornia    argues    that     the   government's       proof       at   trial\n\nimpermissibly varied from the allegations in I96 by establishing\n\nthat   his    role    in   the   alleged    conspiracy       was   not    that       of    a\n\n\"transporter[]       of    drug[s]   or    money\"      in   someone      else's      drug\n\ndistribution operation, but that of an \"owner of drugs,\" which\n\nFornia sold to Torres, who, in turn, sold them to co-conspirators\n\nindicted in I96.       Indeed, while the government introduced evidence\n\nthat Fornia literally \"transport[ed]\" drug proceeds in the trunk of\n\nhis car, the government introduced no evidence whatsoever that\n\nFornia \"transport[ed]\" the cash in the trunk of his car to or for\n\nanyone    else.       Rather,    Torres    testified        that   it    was    he    who\n\ndistributed the cocaine he purchased from Fornia to the individual\n\nidentified in the indictment as #1, \"head and owner drug point,\"\n\nand other indicted co-conspirators.             Torres also testified that he\n\nthen collected cash from other co-conspirators and delivered it to\n\nFornia as partial payment for the cocaine Fornia had supplied.\n\nBecause      the   government's      evidence     of    Fornia's        role    in    the\n\nconspiracy differed from the role of a \"transporter[] of drug[s] or\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\fmoney\" in a conspiracy in which another individual was identified\n\nas the \"head and owner drug point,\" as alleged in the indictment in\n\nI96, there was a variance between the government's proof at trial\n\nand the charge alleged in the indictment.\n\n           Nevertheless, Fornia fails to establish any prejudice\n\nresulting from the variance.       The question \"whether a variance\n\naffected a defendant's substantial rights\" is subject to de novo\n\nreview. United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 774 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nFornia points out that the grand jury that returned the indictment\n\nin I96 never had an opportunity to assess the government's evidence\n\nthat he was an owner of drugs, since the government acknowledges\n\nthat it discovered the facts alleged in I528 only after I96 had\n\nalready been returned.22 Fornia's argument misapprehends the nature\n\nof   the   substantial   rights   protected   by   the   prohibition   on\n\nprejudicial variance from an indictment, namely, the rights to\n\n\"have sufficient knowledge of the charge against [one] in order to\n\nprepare an effective defense and avoid surprise at trial, and to\n\nprevent a second prosecution for the same offense.\"        United States\n\nv. Tormos-Vega, 959 F.2d 1103, 1115 (1st Cir. 1992).23\n\n\n\n\n     22\n      Of course, a different grand jury did indict Fornia for\nconspiracy based on those facts in I528.\n     23\n      Another purpose for the protection against variance from an\nindictment, not at issue here, is to prevent prejudicial spillover\nin cases involving multiple co-defendants. Tormos-Vega, 959 F.2d\nat 1115.\n\n                                  -29-\n\f          The record shows that Fornia had ample notice of and\n\nample opportunity to prepare to meet the government's evidence\n\nbefore trial.   \"The government need not recite all of its evidence\n\nin the indictment, nor is it limited at trial to the overt acts\n\nlisted in the indictment.\"   United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d\n\n456, 477 (1st Cir. 1993).     Here, however, prior to trial, the\n\ngovernment disclosed its intention to introduce evidence in I96\n\nrelating to Fornia's ownership of drugs as alleged in I528.24   That\n\nevidence was relevant to central factual disputes in I96, for\n\nexample, whether the money in Fornia's trunk represented drug\n\nproceeds (as distinct from legal business proceeds), and whether\n\nFornia shared an interest in the sales and distribution activities\n\nof others.   Further, Fornia's particular role in the conspiracy\n\nalleged in I96 was unrelated to his defense theory; rather, Fornia\n\nwas well aware that his \"central defense [in I96] needed to be that\n\nhe was not part of [the] organization -- as a [transporter of drug\n\n\n     24\n      Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), \"[e]vidence of other\ncrimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of\na person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may,\nhowever, be admissible for other purposes . . . provided that upon\nrequest by the accused, the prosecution in a criminal case shall\nprovide reasonable notice in advance of trial, or during trial if\nthe court excuses pretrial notice on good cause shown, of the\ngeneral nature of any such evidence it intends to introduce at\ntrial.\" Prior to trial, the government argued both that it had\ncomplied with the disclosure requirements of Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)\nand that in any event the evidence of acts alleged in I528 did not\nfall within the scope of that rule because the \"crimes, wrongs, or\nacts\" of which it sought to introduce evidence were not \"other\ncrimes, wrongs or acts\" but were intrinsic to the crime of\nconspiracy to distribute cocaine charged in I96.\n\n                               -30-\n\fproceeds, owner of drugs], or in any other capacity.\"                  United\n\nStates v. Alicea-Cardoza, 132 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1997) (no\n\nimpermissible variance where defendant was indicted \"for being a\n\nconspirator/triggerman          but   the      evidence     proved    him    a\n\nconspirator/runner\").       Accordingly, Fornia was not misled by the\n\ngovernment's evidence at trial to \"defend himself on the wrong\n\ngrounds.\"       Id.   Fornia was thus able to \"prepare an effective\n\ndefense and avoid surprise at trial.\"            Tormos-Vega, 959 F.2d at\n\n1115.\n\n            Finally, the trial court detected the potential for\n\nprejudice to Fornia's ability to avoid a successive prosecution for\n\nthe same offense based on the government's introduction of evidence\n\nrelating to the charges in I528 -- including evidence of Fornia's\n\nrole in that conspiracy -- to prove the conspiracy charged in I96.\n\nHowever, as we discuss below in Part III, any such prejudice was\n\ncured by the government's dismissal of the conspiracy count in\n\nI528.    Because the variance failed to affect Fornia's substantial\n\nrights, we reject his challenge to his conviction in I96 on the\n\nground of constructive amendment or prejudicial variance.\n\n                      III. I528 DOUBLE JEOPARDY CLAIM\n\n            Fornia appeals the denial of his motion to dismiss the\n\nindictment in I528 on double jeopardy grounds.                The government\n\nargues   that    Fornia   has   waived   his    double    jeopardy   claim   by\n\nobjecting to its motion to consolidate the cases for trial, thereby\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\f\"elect[ing]      to   have     the   two    offenses   tried     separately    and\n\npersuad[ing] the trial court to honor his election.\"                   Jeffers v.\n\nUnited States, 432 U.S. 127, 152 (1977) (plurality op.). While the\n\nrecord    is    silent    on   Fornia's     reasons    for   objecting    to    the\n\ngovernment's motion, which was made during a pre-trial conference\n\nthree days before Fornia's trial began in I96, Fornia maintains on\n\nappeal that his objection was based solely on his inability to\n\nprepare to try both cases on such short notice rather than as an\n\nattempt to \"persuade\" the trial court of his \"election\" to face\n\nseparate trials.      Id.      The government points out that Fornia could\n\nhave sought a continuance.            In denying the government's motion,\n\nhowever, Judge Carter, who was sitting in Puerto Rico by special\n\ndesignation for a limited period of time, clearly announced his\n\nintention \"to try this case,\" meaning the I96 indictment.                     Under\n\nthese circumstances, we treat Fornia's claim as preserved.25\n\n               The availability of double jeopardy protection is a\n\nconstitutional question reviewable de novo.                    United States v.\n\nLanoue, 137 F.3d 656, 661 (1st Cir. 1998).                     Under the Fifth\n\nAmendment, no person shall \"be subject for the same offence to be\n\ntwice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\"                Among the purposes for\n\ndouble    jeopardy       protection    is     the   prevention    of    \"repeated\n\n\n     25\n       As we have noted, Fornia also expressly reserved the right\nto appeal his conviction in I528 on double jeopardy grounds,\ndespite his guilty plea, pursuant to Menna v. New York, 423 U.S.\n61, 62 (1975) (per curiam) (double jeopardy claim not automatically\nwaived by guilty plea).\n\n                                       -32-\n\fprosecutions for the same offense,\" Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S.\n\n667, 671 (1982), pursuant to \"a constitutional policy of finality\n\nfor the defendant's benefit,\" United States v. Jorn, 400 U.S. 470,\n\n479 (1971) (plurality op.).\n\n                Fornia's double jeopardy claim is narrow in scope. While\n\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause protects against \"the danger that, in\n\nconspiracy cases, the government might . . . partition[] a single\n\nconspiracy into separate prosecutions\" by prohibiting successive\n\nprosecutions       for   conspiracies     with      identical    features,    United\n\nStates     v.    Morris,   99    F.3d   476,    480   (1st    Cir.   1996),   Fornia\n\nultimately faced only one conspiracy prosecution because the second\n\nconspiracy count against him was eventually dismissed.26                      Fornia\n\ntherefore does not allege that he was prosecuted twice for the same\n\nviolation of the same statute, 21 U.S.C. § 846.\n\n                Nor does Fornia make the futile argument that he could\n\nnot   be   successively         prosecuted     in   I528   for   substantive    drug\n\noffenses that were the objects of a drug conspiracy for which\n\nFornia had already been prosecuted in I96.                   Under the traditional\n\ntest announced in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304\n\n\n\n      26\n      As we have discussed, Judge Carter expressed concerns about\ndouble jeopardy during Fornia's trial in I96 after the government\nintroduced evidence of the conspiracy alleged in Count One of I528.\nAfter arguing that the conspiracy charged in I528 was different\nfrom that in I96, the government later represented that it would\nseek to dismiss the conspiracy count in I528. It so moved in July\n2002, after Fornia moved to dismiss I528 on double jeopardy\ngrounds.\n\n                                         -33-\n\f(1932), \"where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation\n\nof two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to\n\ndetermine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether\n\neach provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\"\n\nFornia's sequential prosecutions under different statutes fully\n\nsatisfy the Blockburger test.         \"In order to establish a violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C. § 846, the Government need not prove the commission of\n\nany overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" United States v.\n\nShabani, 513 U.S. 10, 15 (1994).        Conversely, no agreement need be\n\nproven to secure a conviction for a substantive drug offense under\n\n21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).      Indeed, it has long been established that\n\n\"conspiracy to commit a crime is not the same offense as the\n\nsubstantive crime for double jeopardy purposes,\" Lanoue, 137 F.3d\n\nat 662, because \"the agreement to do the act is distinct from the\n\n[completed] act itself,\" United States v. Felix, 503 U.S. 378, 390-\n\n91 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted) (adhering to line of\n\ncases holding that separate prosecutions for conspiracy and for\n\nunderlying substantive offenses do not violate the Double Jeopardy\n\nClause).\n\n           Fornia    attempts   to     reach   shelter   under    the   Double\n\nJeopardy Clause by a different route.             He points out that the\n\nSupreme    Court    has   suggested     that   even   where   a   successive\n\nprosecution would otherwise be barred under the Blockburger test,\n\nsuch a prosecution may nevertheless be permissible under the Double\n\n\n                                      -34-\n\fJeopardy Clause where \"the additional facts necessary to sustain [a\n\nsubsequent] charge ha[d] not [yet] occurred or ha[d] not [yet] been\n\ndiscovered despite the exercise of due diligence\" at the time of\n\nthe first prosecution.       Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 169 n.7\n\n(1977).   Fornia asks us to fashion a new rule by holding that the\n\nDouble Jeopardy Clause also prohibits successive prosecutions that\n\nwould not otherwise be barred under the Blockburger test where, in\n\nthe exercise of due diligence, the government could have brought\n\nthe prosecutions in the same proceeding.         See Fed R. Crim. P. 8(a)\n\n(permitting joinder of charges against a defendant in the same\n\nindictment \"if the offenses charged . . . are of the same or\n\nsimilar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or\n\nare connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or\n\nplan\").\n\n            Fornia's proposed rule is a barely disguised attempt to\n\nresurrect    the   \"same   transaction\"   test    for   determining   when\n\nsuccessive prosecutions are barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n\nSuch a test, \"which would require the Government to try together\n\nall offenses (regardless of the differences in the statutes) based\n\non one event,\" has been \"consistently rejected by the [Supreme]\n\nCourt.\"     United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688, 709 n.14 (1993).\n\nInstead, \"the performance of a Blockburger analysis completes the\n\njudicial task in a successive prosecution case.\"         Morris, 99 F.3d\n\nat 480.      Even where, as in Fornia's cases, prosecutions for\n\n\n                                  -35-\n\fdifferent     offenses   may    be    suitable       for    joinder,    successive\n\nprosecutions are permitted under the Double Jeopardy Clause so long\n\nas the offenses pass the Blockburger test, with its \"focus[] on the\n\nstatutory elements of each offense.\"                 United States v. Colon-\n\nOsorio, 10 F.3d 41, 43 (1st Cir. 1993).                     We therefore reject\n\nFornia's claim that his prosecution in I528 was barred by the\n\nDouble Jeopardy Clause solely because the government, in the\n\nexercise of due diligence, could have brought the charges in a\n\nsuperseding    indictment      or    could    have   more    promptly    moved   to\n\nconsolidate I96 and I528 for trial.27\n\n                    IV. SENTENCING IN I96 AND I528\n\nA.          Background\n\n            Under 21 U.S.C. §§ 846 and 841(b)(1)(A), Fornia was\n\nsubject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years'\n\nimprisonment and a maximum term of life imprisonment for each of\n\nhis convictions, given the jury's finding in I96 and his admissions\n\nin his guilty pleas in I528 that the quantity of cocaine involved\n\n\n     27\n      Fornia's reliance on two decisions by our sister circuits\nthat allegedly adopt such a rule is misplaced. See Rashad v. Burt,\n108 F.3d 677 (6th Cir. 1997); United States v. Reed, 980 F.2d 1568\n(11th Cir. 1993).    Not only are the circumstances of Fornia's\nsequential prosecutions factually distinguishable, but these cases\nare of limited applicability even in their originating circuits.\nSee United States v. Forman, 180 F.3d 766, 770 (6th Cir. 1999)\n(limiting language in Rashad that may conflict with Dixon to apply\nonly to the specific circumstances present in Rashad); United\nStates v. Maza, 983 F.2d 1004, 1008 n.8 (11th Cir. 1993)\n(characterizing as dicta language in a case cited in Reed as\nauthority for a due diligence rule imposed by the Double Jeopardy\nClause).\n\n                                       -36-\n\fin each offense exceeded 5 kilograms. Under the federal Sentencing\n\nGuidelines,     Fornia's   sentence      in   each   case   was    limited    to   a\n\nnarrower Guidelines Sentencing Range (\"GSR\") based on an assessment\n\nof   his    Criminal   History    Category     and   a   total    offense    level\n\ncalculated by identifying a \"'base offense level' corresponding to\n\nthe crime for which [he was] convicted, as modified by mandatory\n\n'adjustments'     which    take   into   account     certain      aggravating      or\n\nmitigating factors.\"       United States v. Austin, 239 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).28\n\n             We recount the facts pertinent to Fornia's sentencing as\n\ngleaned from \"uncontested portions of the presentence investigation\n\nreport[s] and the transcript[s] of the sentencing hearing[s].\"\n\nUnited States v. Cloutier, 966 F.2d 24, 25 (1st Cir. 1992).                  On the\n\nmorning of December 5, 2002, the court held a sentencing hearing in\n\nI96.    The court calculated Fornia's base offense level as 34 for a\n\ndrug offense involving 21 kilograms of cocaine.                   See U.S.S.G. §\n\n2D1.1(a)(3).      The court arrived at this 21-kilogram figure by\n\ndividing the total amount of drug proceeds seized from Fornia\n\n\n\n       28\n      A reviewing court ordinarily \"appl[ies] the edition [of the\nSentencing Guidelines] in effect at the time of sentencing.\"\nUnited States v. Martin, 363 F.3d 25, 32 n.3 (1st Cir. 2004). In\nFornia's case, that would be the edition that went into effect on\nNovember 1, 2002.     For reasons that remain unclear, Fornia's\npresentence investigation reports were prepared according to the\n2000 Guidelines. The parties have pointed out no differences in\nthe 2000 and 2002 versions of the Guidelines applicable to Fornia,\nnor have we detected any.      All references to the Guidelines\nthroughout this opinion are thus to the 2002 edition.\n\n                                      -37-\n\f($281,926) by the amount Torres testified that he paid Fornia per\n\nkilogram of cocaine ($13,000), as recommended in the presentence\n\ninvestigation report (\"PSR\") for I96.                The court then found that\n\nFornia had been \"a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or\n\nleader)    and    the     criminal   activity         involved      five   or    more\n\nparticipants or was otherwise extensive\" within the meaning of\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(b), warranting a three-level upward adjustment to\n\nreach a total offense level of 37.             The court declined to impose an\n\nupward adjustment sought by the government for the specific offense\n\ncharacteristic of possession of a firearm. U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1).\n\nThe court also declined to impose an acceptance of responsibility\n\ndownward adjustment because Fornia had gone to trial in I96.                      See\n\nU.S.S.G.   §     3E1.1,    cmt.   n.2     (adjustment         for   acceptance    of\n\nresponsibility generally unavailable to defendant who \"puts the\n\ngovernment to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential\n\nfactual elements of guilt\").            The court then sentenced Fornia to\n\nthe   minimum    sentence,     210   months'         imprisonment,     within    the\n\nappropriate GSR for an offender in Criminal History Category I\n\n(210-262 months), and imposed a fine of $5000 and a five-year term\n\nof supervised release.\n\n           Later    that     afternoon,        the    court     held   a   separate\n\nsentencing hearing in I528. The court determined that the quantity\n\nof drugs involved in all conduct relevant to the charged offenses\n\nwas the sum total of the amounts involved in the four substantive\n\n\n                                        -38-\n\fcounts in I528, or 170 kilograms.29             Following the recommendation\n\nof the PSR in I528, the court reasoned that \"21 of those kilograms\n\nwere the subject of the . . . sentence in [I96]\" and had already\n\nbeen accounted for by that sentence.            Accordingly, the court used\n\nthe remaining quantity, 149 kilograms, to calculate a base offense\n\nlevel of 36 in I528.         The court then found that Fornia \"was an\n\norganizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or\n\nmore participants or was otherwise extensive\" within the meaning of\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a), warranting a four-level upward adjustment to\n\nreach a total offense level of 40.          The court also found, based on\n\nthe government's representation and the description in the PSR\n\nprepared in I528, that two indicted co-conspirators who had pled\n\nguilty in I528 had placed Fornia in possession of a firearm during\n\na drug-related incident. The court accordingly imposed a two-level\n\nupward    adjustment   for   the    specific     offense   characteristic     of\n\npossession    of   a   firearm     during   a    drug   offense,   U.S.S.G.    §\n\n2D1.1(b)(1), reaching a total offense level of 42.            Because Fornia\n\npled guilty to the four counts in I528, however, the court imposed\n\na three-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3E1.1(b), lowering the total offense level to 39. Finally, based\n\non Fornia's \"prior undischarged sentence\" imposed that morning in\n\n\n\n     29\n      Although Fornia pled guilty to the factual basis for each of\nthe substantive counts in I528, he admitted only that each count\ninvolved a quantity in excess of five kilograms of cocaine.\n\n\n                                     -39-\n\fI96, the court awarded three criminal history points to place\n\nFornia in Criminal History Category II.            U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(a).   The\n\ncourt then sentenced Fornia to the maximum sentence, 365 months'\n\nimprisonment, within the applicable GSR (292-365 months), to run\n\nconcurrently as to the four substantive counts, but consecutive to\n\nthe sentence of 210 months' imprisonment in I96, for a total term\n\nof imprisonment in both cases of just under 48 years.30             The court\n\nalso imposed a fine of $250,000 and a five-year term of supervised\n\nrelease to run concurrently with the term of supervised release\n\nimposed in I96. The court declined Fornia's request for a downward\n\ndeparture   on    the   basis   of   alleged   prosecutorial      misconduct.\n\nFinally,    the    court    determined      that     no   other    mitigating\n\ncircumstances -- neither Fornia's deportability nor his allegations\n\nof disparity in his sentence as compared with those of his co-\n\ndefendants -- warranted a downward departure.\n\n            Fornia appeals his sentences on multiple grounds, several\n\nof which are interrelated.       Specifically, Fornia argues that: (1)\n\nthe district court imposed mandatory sentence enhancements based\n\nsolely on judicially found facts, increasing the sentence in each\n\ncase beyond the maximum authorized by jury-found or admitted facts\n\n\n     30\n      Explaining its decision to impose the maximum sentence in the\nGSR, the court cited Fornia's criminal history, including his\nconviction in I96 as well as a prior conviction from 1975 that was\nmentioned in each of his PSRs but which had been excluded from the\nCriminal History Category calculation in each case pursuant to\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(e).    The court made no reference to the 1975\nconviction during sentencing in I96.\n\n                                     -40-\n\fin violation of Booker; (2) the court erred by failing to use the\n\nsame drug quantity involved in the conspiracy in I96, 21 kilograms,\n\nto sentence Fornia on the four substantive counts in I528 because\n\nthe cases involved related conduct, see U.S.S.G § 1B1.3; (3) the\n\ncourt imposed a consecutive rather than a concurrent term of\n\nimprisonment    in   I528,   including    role-in-the-offense   sentence\n\nenhancements based on the same conduct in each case, in violation\n\nof Fornia's Fifth Amendment rights to due process and protection\n\nagainst double jeopardy; (4) the court improperly assigned criminal\n\nhistory points on the basis of Fornia's sentence for the conspiracy\n\nconviction in I96 to increase his sentence in I528, see U.S.S.G. §\n\n4A1.2;   (5)   the   court   improperly   denied   Fornia's   motion   to\n\nconsolidate his cases for sentencing and failed to group the counts\n\nin both indictments, see U.S.S.G. §§ 3D1.1-3D1.5 and 5G1.2(b)-(c);\n\n(6) the role-in-the-offense sentence enhancement in I96 violates\n\nthe Presentment Clause of the Fifth Amendment; and (7) the evidence\n\nwas insufficient to support, by a preponderance of the evidence,\n\nthe court's imposition of role-in-the-offense enhancements in both\n\nI96 and I528, see U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1, and the \"specific offense\n\ncharacteristic\" adjustment for possession of a firearm in I528, see\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1).      As we discuss below, our disposition of\n\nFornia's claims of Booker error obviates the need to address his\n\nother sentencing claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -41-\n\fB.        Booker Error\n\n          After briefing was completed and oral argument held in\n\nthis case, the Supreme Court decided Booker, in which the Court\n\nprecluded, on Sixth Amendment grounds, a sentencing court from\n\nimposing a sentence on the basis of judicially found facts that\n\n\"exceed[s] the maximum authorized by the facts established by a\n\nplea of guilty or a jury verdict\", Booker, 125 S. Ct. at 756, but\n\n\"only insofar as the sentence resulted from a mandatory system\n\nimposing binding requirements on sentencing judges,\" United States\n\nv. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005).   Because \"the\n\nmandatory nature of the Guidelines . . . raised constitutional\n\nconcerns,\" id., the Court eliminated such concerns by striking the\n\nstatutory provision that renders the Sentencing Guidelines binding\n\non federal courts, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1).31\n\n          Fornia cited Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000),\n\nin his written objections to the draft PSR in each of his cases as\n\na ground for objection to the imposition of role enhancements or\n\nadjustments for possession of a firearm.32   We therefore treat his\n\n\n     31\n      The Court also struck 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e), which authorized\nappellate courts to engage in de novo review over certain aspects\nof federal sentencing. Booker, 125 S. Ct. at 764. The Court left\nthe remainder of the Act, including the requirement that a\nsentencing court calculate and consider the sentence recommended by\nthe Guidelines, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(4), untouched. Antonakopoulos,\n399 F.3d at 76.\n     32\n      As we have discussed, the district court imposed role\nenhancements in both cases, but imposed an upward adjustment for\npossession of a firearm in I528 only.\n\n                               -42-\n\fclaims of Booker error as preserved on appeal and subject to review\n\nfor harmless error.    Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 76.33       As a result\n\nof   the   Supreme   Court's   remedial   decision,   Booker    error   is\n\nestablished whenever \"a defendant's Guidelines sentence was imposed\n\nunder a mandatory Guidelines system,\" whether or not the sentencing\n\ncourt relied on judicial fact-finding to increase the sentence\n\nbeyond the maximum authorized by jury-found or admitted facts.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75.       Under harmless error review of\n\nBooker claims, in order to avoid a remand for resentencing under\n\nadvisory Guidelines,\n\n           the government has the burden of proving\n           beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did\n           not affect the defendant's substantial rights.\n           That is, we must be convinced that a lower\n           sentence would not have been imposed had the\n           Guidelines been advisory.        This is an\n           extremely difficult, but not impossible,\n           standard to meet.\n\nVázquez-Rivera, 2005 WL 1163672, at *10, ___ F.3d at ___.

Washington, 542\nU.S. ___, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), in his reply brief.       Because\nFornia's claims of Booker error are preserved and therefore subject\nto harmless error review, no supplemental briefing was invited from\nor submitted by the parties in the wake of Booker or\nAntonakopoulos.   See Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 83 (permitting\nparties to submit supplemental briefing on consequences of the\npanel's decision for unpreserved claims of Booker error). Fornia\ndid, however, file a letter pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 28(j)\napprising the panel of these decisions.\n\n                                  -43-\n\fprerequisite for the preservation of a claim of Booker error34 --\n\n\"factual certainty alone\" in support of such enhancements \"would\n\nnot be sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the judge,\n\nacting under an advisory Guidelines system, would have applied the\n\nsame sentence on the basis of those factors.\"           Id.\n\n            Applying this standard to Fornia's sentences, we cannot\n\nconclude with the requisite certainty that the district court would\n\nnot have imposed lower sentences in each of his cases under a non-\n\nmandatory Guidelines regime.             As our description of Fornia's\n\nmultiple   claims      of   Guidelines   error   suggests,    the   Guidelines\n\nsentencing here was complex.         In response, the court imposed the\n\nminimum sentence under the GSR for the conspiracy conviction in\n\nI96, the maximum sentence under the GSR for the convictions on the\n\nfour substantive offenses in I528 (with those sentences being\n\nconcurrent to each other), and then made the maximum sentence\n\nconsecutive to the minimum sentence.         On its face, this mixture of\n\nleniency and stringency is unusual, and the reasons for these\n\nchoices    are   not   entirely   clear.     This   observation     is   not   a\n\ncriticism.       The court faced a particularly difficult sentencing\n\nproblem because the closely related cases were prosecuted and\n\nsentenced in separate proceedings, requiring the court to treat\n\n\n\n     34\n      In Antonakopoulos, we stated, \"[t]he argument that a Booker\nerror occurred is preserved if the defendant below argued Apprendi\nor Blakely error or that the Guidelines were unconstitutional.\"\n399 F.3d at 76.\n\n                                     -44-\n\fFornia's   cases    as   simultaneously           related,      yet     separate,      for\n\npurposes   of     sentencing       within       the   confines     of    a     mandatory\n\nGuidelines regime.\n\n           Indeed, the court appears to have been mindful of the\n\ndesirability of mitigating the consequences of the government's\n\ndecision to bring successive prosecutions against Fornia in its\n\nsubtraction of 21 kilograms of cocaine from the total quantity\n\ninvolved in the offenses in I528 because that portion had already\n\nbeen \"the subject of the . . . sentence in [I96].\"                      The Guidelines\n\nencourage such attention to the potential unfairness of duplicative\n\npunishment resulting solely from prosecutorial charging decisions.\n\nFor example, U.S.S.G. § 5G1.3, under which Fornia was sentenced to\n\na consecutive term of imprisonment in I528, \"was designed 'to\n\nmitigate   the    possibility       that    the       fortuity    of     two      separate\n\nprosecutions      will   grossly     increase         a   defendant's        sentence.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Caraballo, 200 F.3d 20, 27 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(quoting Witte v. United States, 515 U.S. 389, 404-05 (1995)).                          To\n\nthat end, subsection (c) contains a policy statement favoring the\n\n\"achiev[ement of] a reasonable punishment\" even where a sentencing\n\ncourt   retains    the   discretion        to    impose     a   wholly    concurrent,\n\npartially concurrent, or wholly consecutive sentence.\n\n           We     deem   it   unnecessary         and     inadvisable        to   discuss\n\nFornia's   many    claims     of   Guidelines         sentencing      error       further;\n\nsuffice it to say that we cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt\n\n\n                                       -45-\n\fthat the court would have resolved the many interrelated sentencing\n\nissues it faced in precisely the same manner by \"impos[ing] the\n\nsame sentence in the absence of mandatory Guidelines.\"                  Vázquez-\n\nRivera,   2005   WL   1163672,   at   *10,   ___    F.3d   at    ___.    We   are\n\nparticularly reluctant to make presumptions in the face of such a\n\nsevere total punishment, a sentence of nearly 48 years -- virtually\n\na life sentence.      We therefore conclude that both cases should be\n\nremanded for resentencing under Booker.            However, our decision to\n\nremand for resentencing should not be read as a \"suggestion or a\n\nprediction    that    [Fornia's]      sentence[s]     will      necessarily    be\n\naltered.\"    United States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n                                       V.\n\n            Fornia's convictions are affirmed; his sentences on those\n\nconvictions are vacated.         We remand for resentencing consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -46-\n\f",

Fornia-Castillo was indicted, tried, and convicted on a single count of conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846. He then sought to dismiss, on double jeopardy grounds, a second indictment charging him with another count of conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 and four substantive counts of possession with intent to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A), and aiding and abetting others in those offenses in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. After the government dismissed the second conspiracy count, the court denied Fornia's motion to dismiss the second indictment. Fornia then pled guilty to each of the four remaining substantive offense counts, expressly reserving his right to appeal those convictions on double jeopardy grounds. Fornia was sentenced in separate hearings to consecutive terms of 210 months' imprisonment for the conspiracy conviction and 365 months' imprisonment for the four substantive counts (to run concurrently to each other), for a total term of imprisonment of approximately 48 years. Fornia appeals his convictions and sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to his conspiracy conviction, Fornia argues that: (1) the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress evidence obtained in violation of his Fourth Amendment right to protection against unreasonable searches and seizures and his Fifth Amendment right to protection against self-incrimination; (2) his pre-trial counsel rendered constitutionally defective representation at his suppression hearing in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel; and (3) the government violated his Fifth Amendment right to indictment by a grand jury by constructively amending the indictment after its presentment to the grand jury. With respect to his pleas to the substantive offenses, Fornia argues that the prosecution was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment because the government failed to exercise due diligence either by seeking a superseding indictment to the initial conspiracy charge or by promptly joining both cases for prosecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Fornia also assigns numerous errors to his sentences, including the claim that the court imposed mandatory sentence enhancements in each case based solely on judicial fact-finding, thereby increasing the maximum sentence otherwise authorized by jury-found or admitted facts in violation of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful consideration of each of Fornia's claims, tested against the record on appeal, we affirm Fornia's convictions. Because we are not \"convinced that a lower sentence would not have been imposed\" under a post-<i>Booker,</i> non-mandatory Guidelines regime, <i>United States v.

Agents followed the two men as they drove the car from the furniture store to a bakery, where they met a third man unknown to the agents, who was later identified as Fornia. The agents observed the men transferring the contents of the car trunk to the trunk of Fornia's car, and began following Fornia as he drove away from the bakery alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At around 7:45 PM, agents instructed a member of the Task Force who was a local police officer in uniform to pull Fornia over under the pretense of investigating a report of a car stolen from a nearby shopping center whose description matched Fornia's car. After identifying Fornia through his driver's license and car registration, the officer obtained Fornia's consent to search the car, including a garbage bag in the trunk, which contained several smaller bags and a shoe box, all filled with large amounts of cash. Once the officer saw the cash, he handcuffed Fornia and frisked him, finding no weapon.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> While Fornia was handcuffed, the officer signaled for assistance from two local police officers who were not part of the Task Force but who happened to be patrolling the area. Fornia remained handcuffed until another Task Force member arrived on the scene, pretending to be another police officer in charge of security at the shopping center parking lot, and ordered the handcuffs removed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The newly arrived agent informed Fornia that the money would have to be turned over either to the tax authorities, who would take the cash, deduct a portion, and return the remainder to Fornia by check, or, in the alternative, to the DEA. Fornia stated several times that he would prefer to turn the money over to the tax authorities, observing that their procedure resembled money laundering. Instead, the officers awaited the arrival of DEA agents, all of whom were members of the Task Force investigating the suspected drug conspiracy. When the DEA agents arrived, they told Fornia that he was not under arrest for carrying a large quantity of cash. The agents questioned Fornia about his recent whereabouts and asked where he was going with the large amount of cash. Fornia did not mention that he had been at the bakery, but replied that he had bought coffee at the shopping center and that he was bringing the money to his mother-in-law's house to be stored. The agents then seized the money and asked Fornia to go to the DEA office for further questioning. Fornia agreed and drove his own car to the DEA office, where he answered additional questions. Fornia was then given a receipt for the cash and left the DEA office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 26, 2000, a federal grand jury returned a sealed indictment (\"I96\") charging 26 named individuals, including Fornia, and unknown co-conspirators with a solitary count of conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 during a time period beginning \"not later than the summer of 1997\" and continuing through the date of the indictment. The indictment assigned each named individual a number and described his or her alleged role within the conspiracy. Fornia, #21, was included among # 16-23 as \"transporters of drug[s] or money.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The indictment also alleged 74 overt acts, \"among others,\" committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. Fornia's name appeared only once in the list of overt acts, in paragraph 50, which alleged that \"[o]n September 9, 1999, (2) Fernando TORRES-Fernandez and (20) Osvaldo VILLEGAS-Rivera delivered to (21) Luis FORNIA-Castillo approximately Two Hundred Eighty-One Thousand and Nine Hundred Twenty-Six Dollars ($281,926.00) of drug proceeds\" (emphasis omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment was unsealed on May 1, 2000, and Fornia was arrested on a warrant that day. He was later released on bail. On December 27, 2000, Fornia moved to suppress the evidence, including his statements, obtained as a result of the September 9, 1999 stop and search of his car and his subsequent interview at the DEA office. After an evidentiary hearing before Judge Casellas on February 5-6, 2001, the motion was denied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> By March 2001, each of Fornia's 25 co-defendants in I96 had pled guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 1, 2001, a federal grand jury returned a sealed indictment (\"I528\") charging 15 named individuals, including Fornia and one other person who had also been indicted in I96,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and others unknown, with conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 during a time period beginning \"on or about the end part of 1996\" and continuing through the date of the indictment. As in I96, all of the conduct alleged against Fornia in I528 took place no earlier than \"the summer of 1997.\" I528 identified Fornia as #1, \"owner of drugs.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The indictment also charged Fornia with four additional counts alleging substantive offenses in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A), and aiding and abetting others in those offenses in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.

OSVALDO VILLEGAS RIVERA[] and an unindicted co-conspirator delivered to . . . LUIS B. FORNIA-CASTILLO approximately $281,926.00 of drug proceeds, money related to over[t] acts Nos. 6 and 7 herein\" (emphasis omitted).

R. Crim P. 8(a). However, since [by] August 1, 2001, [the date on which the second indictment was returned,] all the codefendants with the exception of codefendant Luis B. Fornia-Castillo in [I96] had already pled guilty[,] the government elected to file a separate indictment against fourteen (14) additional co-defendants in lieu of supersed[ing] the indictment in [I96].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fornia's trial in I96 began two days later, on April 18, 2002, and continued for five days. The government's first witness was a member of the DEA Task Force who described the events depicted on a surveillance videotape, including the arrival and departure of suspected co-conspirators at the furniture store on September 9, 1999, the two co-conspirators' rendezvous with Fornia at the bakery, and the subsequent discovery of the bags of cash in Fornia's trunk by investigators during the stop and search of his car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then called an indicted co-conspirator, Fernando Torres-Fernandez, who had pled guilty in I96, as a cooperating witness. Torres testified that sometime in late 1997, Fornia asked him if he had any contacts at the airport who could assist in shipping cocaine to New York. According to Torres, he and two other co-conspirators then met with Fornia to arrange a test shipment of 50 kilograms of cocaine to New York.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Torres testified that when the test shipment, which also involved a fifth individual who worked at the local airport, proved successful, the same group of four co-conspirators arranged a second shipment of more than 50 kilograms of cocaine to New York.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The second shipment, however, never arrived at its destination, according to Torres, because the airport worker had been killed and the cocaine lost. Torres testified that the four co-conspirators had gone to the airport several times to try to find the killer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Torres' testimony, Fornia's counsel objected several times on hearsay grounds to Torres' reports of statements made by other alleged co-conspirators. After one such objection, the court took judicial notice of the indictment in I528, which was pending before Judge P&#233;rez-Gim&#233;nez. Because the events Torres described were alleged only in I528, and the co-conspirators to whom Torres referred were indicted only in I528, the court asked the government whether it could show that the co-conspirators were also participants in the conspiracy charged in I96 for purposes of admitting their hearsay statements. The court then asked: \"Why have you indicted in two separate indictments, alleging in the indictment all of these transactions in case number 528, and now you are proving those acts and transactions in a separate case, this one bearing number 96. I don't understand what you are trying to do.\" The government responded that \"at the time [I96 and I528] were indicted, they were separate conspirac[ies].\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> The court warned, \"You can't convict the same defendant two times [for the same conspiracy].\" The court then permitted the government to proceed with its direct examination of Torres, advising the government that it would not admit co-conspirator hearsay \"until you tell me that you can connect those co-conspirators to this conspiracy and not just to the other [one in I528].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres next testified that on September 9, 1999, he had collected money from several people in order to pay Fornia for about 40 kilograms of cocaine Torres had purchased from him at a price of $13,000 per kilogram. Torres testified that the cash seized from Fornia later that same day represented partial payment for the drugs after successful resale.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Torres also identified a paper bag and a shoe box that had been used to hold the cash, and identified his handwriting on the containers recording the amount of cash held in each. Torres went on to state that on September 10, 1999, Fornia had informed him that the cash had been seized by the DEA the previous day, but that Fornia planned to recover the cash through a suppression motion or by characterizing the money as proceeds from his legal motorcycle business. Torres then described new installment payment procedures Fornia devised for receiving future payments in order to avoid the possibility of any additional seizures of large amounts of cash. Finally, Torres described one additional incident that took place after September 9, 1999, in which Fornia supplied him with about 30 kilograms of cocaine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the government rested its case, Fornia moved for an acquittal. His counsel stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">because this case . . . involved a conspiratorial time period that would overlap with [1528], it appears that the evidence that has been brought here is partially from [1528] and . . . because of that, I don't know how we can decide whether this particular conspiracy has been set forth with all of the elements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court asked the government how, in the event Fornia was convicted in 196, he would \"prove[] in the other court that he has already been convicted of the same conduct that he is charged with [in 1528]?\" In response, the government continued to assert that the conspiracy alleged in 1528 was different from the one for which Fornia was being tried in 196. Eventually, however, the government represented that it would request dismissal of the conspiracy count against Fornia in 1528.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 24, 2002, the jury found Fornia guilty of conspiracy and found that the quantity of cocaine involved in the offense exceeded five kilograms. On April 26, 2002, Fornia moved for a new trial alleging that \"the government's failure to provide required pretrial disclosure materially prejudiced [his] right to a fair trial\" and that \"by falsely indicting and prosecuting [Fornia] for two conspiracies when it knew there was only one, the government deprived [him] of a fair trial.\" On June 6, 2002, Fornia also moved in 196 to \"confirm consolidation\" of his cases on the ground that, <i>inter alia,</i> they involved the same alleged conspiracy. The government opposed Fornia's motion to confirm consolidation of the cases, arguing that: (1) consolidation had already been denied; (2) \"no substantial public interest [would] be promoted\" by consolidation \"[a]t this stage of the proceedings\"; and (3) Fornia was estopped from seeking consolidation or had waived the claim because he had opposed the government's earlier motion, filed on the eve of trial, to consolidate the cases. On June 25, 2002, Judge Carter denied both Fornia's motion for a new trial and his motion to confirm consolidation of the cases, noting that any double jeopardy concerns could adequately be addressed by Judge P&#233;rez-Gim&#233;nez in 1528.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 1, 2002, Fornia filed a motion to dismiss 1528 on double jeopardy grounds. As promised, the government dismissed the conspiracy count against Fornia in 1528 on July 3, 2002. Fornia then moved in 1528 for a change of plea.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> At the change-of-plea hearing on July 15, 2002, Judge P&#233;rez-Gim&#233;nez denied Fornia's motion to dismiss 1528. Fornia then pled guilty to the four remaining counts charging him with substantive drug offenses. Although Fornia did not enter into a plea agreement with the government, he expressly reserved the right to appeal his conviction in 1528 on double jeopardy grounds, citing <i>Menna v. New York,</i> 423 U.S. 61, 62-63, 96 S.Ct. 241, 46 L.Ed.2d 195 (1975) (per curiam) (guilty plea does not automatically waive double jeopardy claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 8, 2002, Judge Carter recused himself from sentencing, and the case was reassigned to Judge P&#233;rez-Gim&#233;nez. Fornia moved in 1528 to consolidate both cases for sentencing on October 25, 2002, but Judge P&#233;rez-Gim&#233;nez denied the motion. On the morning of December 5, 2002, Judge P&#233;rez-Gim&#233;nez sentenced Fornia in 196 to 210 months' imprisonment. That afternoon, in a separate sentencing hearing, the court sentenced Fornia in 1528 to 365 months' imprisonment to run concurrently as to the four substantive counts, but consecutive to the sentence in 196. Fornia timely appealed his convictions and his sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. 196 CONSPIRACY CONVICTION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Suppression of Evidence</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Validity of Consent to Search</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We construe Fornia's Fourth Amendment claim, which he raises in a pro se brief, as a renewal of his challenge to the voluntariness of his consent to the search of the bag in his car trunk. <i>See United States v. Weidul,</i> 325 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir.2003) (consent to a warrantless search \"must be voluntary to be valid\"). Fornia alleges that his consent was invalid because it was coerced by the police officer's drawing of his gun after Fornia opened the car trunk, requiring suppression of the bags of cash contained within the larger bag in the trunk. \"Typically, whether consent is voluntary turns on questions of fact, determinable from the totality of the circumstances. For that reason, a finding of voluntary consent (other than one based on an erroneous legal standard) is reviewable only for clear error, and the trial court's credibility determinations ordinarily must be respected.\" <i>United States v. Romain,</i> 393 F.3d 63, 69 (1st Cir.2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the suppression hearing, Officer Alverio, the police officer who initially stopped Fornia, testified that after Fornia consented to a search of the car and opened the trunk to reveal a large bag, he asked Fornia if he would mind opening the bag. When Fornia began to open the bag, Officer Alverio testified that he drew his gun in a \"defensive position\" &#8212; out of Fornia's visual range and pointing at the ground &#8212; because it was too dark for him to be able to see whether the trunk contained any weapons. The district court determined that Officer Alverio \"provided credible undisputed testimony that Fornia voluntarily agreed to allow him to search the vehicle and to examine the trunk.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> The court specifically found that the officer \"kept [the gun] out of Fornia's view[] and at his side, and placed it back in his holster when Fornia stepped away from the trunk, all of which were confirmed by the [surveillance] video\" played during the hearing. The court further found that \"the video shows Fornia willingly reach[ing] in to the open trunk of the vehicle and open[ing] the bags containing the money.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because \"the evidence presented at the suppression hearing fairly supports\" the district court's factual findings, <i>United States v. Laine,</i> 270 F.3d 71, 75 (1st Cir. 2001), the district court committed no clear error in determining that Fornia's consent to the search of the car trunk was valid. Based on those findings, the court properly denied Fornia's motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Miranda</i> Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fornia argues that the statements he made during his entire encounter with the Task Force agents, including those made at the DEA office, should have been suppressed because he was subjected to custodial interrogation without first being advised of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to protection against self-incrimination. <i>See Dickerson v. United States,</i> 530 U.S. 428, 435, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000) (failure to give required <i>Miranda</i> warnings amounts to Fifth Amendment violation).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> \"<i>Miranda</i> warnings must be given before a suspect is subjected to custodial interrogation.\" <i>United States v. Ventura,</i> 85 F.3d 708, 710 (1st Cir.1996). By contrast, \"[a]s a general rule, <i>Terry</i> stops do not implicate the requirements of <i>Miranda.</i>\" <i>United States v. Streifel,</i> 781 F.2d 953, 958 (1st Cir.1986).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> This is so \"because `<i>Terry</i> stops, though inherently somewhat coercive, do not usually involve the type of police dominated or compelling atmosphere which necessitates <i>Miranda</i> warnings.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Bautista,</i> 684 F.2d 1286, 1291 (9th Cir.1982)). A valid investigatory stop may nevertheless escalate into custody, thereby triggering the need for <i>Miranda</i> warnings, where the totality of the circumstances shows that a reasonable person would understand that he was being held to \"the degree associated with a formal arrest,\" <i>Stansbury v. California,</i> 511 U.S. 318, 322, 114 S.Ct. 1526, 128 L.Ed.2d 293 (1994) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). Relevant factors bearing on whether an investigatory stop has evolved into a de facto arrest include \"whether the suspect was questioned in familiar or at least neutral surroundings, the number of law enforcement officers present at the scene, the degree of physical restraint placed upon the suspect, and the duration and character of the interrogation.\" <i>Ventura,</i> 85 F.3d at 711 (internal quotation marks omitted). While we review the court's factual findings for clear error, the ultimate conclusion whether a seizure is a de facto arrest \"qualifies for independent review\" because it presents a \"mixed question of law and fact.\" <i>United States v. Trueber,</i> 238 F.3d 79, 91, 93 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>Thompson v. Keohane,</i> 516 U.S. 99, 113, 116 S.Ct. 457, 133 L.Ed.2d 383 (1995)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the suppression hearing, Officer Alverio testified that once he saw the large quantity of cash contained in the bags in Fornia's car trunk, he re-holstered his weapon and handcuffed and frisked Fornia because he was the sole law enforcement officer on the scene, and, in his personal experience, people who may be traveling with large quantities of drug proceeds may also be armed or may travel with armed escorts. Officer Alverio explained that he did not remove the handcuffs even after the local police officers arrived on the scene to assist him because he did not know the officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fornia argues that the totality of the circumstances establishes that the stop of his car, while initially a valid investigatory stop, escalated into a de facto arrest triggering the need for <i>Miranda</i> warnings. Fornia maintains that the combination of the officer's display of a gun, his use of handcuffs and a pat-down search, and his explanation that he was investigating a car theft would have led a reasonable person to believe he was effectively under arrest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> In particular, Fornia argues that he was subjected to custodial interrogation because Officer Alverio questioned him while he was handcuffed. Indeed, Officer Alverio testified during the suppression hearing that he asked Fornia where the money in his trunk had come from while Fornia was handcuffed, and that Fornia responded that the money was from his motorcycle business. While the government did not introduce this particular statement at trial, Fornia maintains that the statements he made after the handcuffs were removed in response to questioning by other Task Force agents should have been suppressed because they were derived from the same <i>Miranda</i> violation. <i>See United States v. Byram,</i> 145 F.3d 405, 409-10 (1st Cir.1998) (\"where the <i>Miranda</i> violation is not merely technical, where there is a substantial nexus between the violation and the second statement, and where the second statement is not itself preceded by an adequate <i>Miranda</i> warning,\" suppression of subsequent voluntary statements may be warranted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that Fornia was not subjected to custodial interrogation at any time during the stop and therefore that no <i>Miranda</i> violation occurred. The court recognized \"two arguably coercive facts\" in support of Fornia's <i>Miranda</i> violation claims: Officer Alverio's drawing of his gun and his use of handcuffs. As the court correctly noted, however, neither the use of handcuffs nor the drawing of a weapon necessarily transforms a valid <i>Terry</i> stop into a de facto arrest. <i>Trueber,</i> 238 F.3d at 94 (officer's drawing of weapon while asking suspected narcotics trafficker to step out of vehicle at night does not transform entire investigatory stop into de facto arrest); <i>United States v. Acosta-Colon,</i> 157 F.3d 9, 18 (1st Cir.1998) (the \"use of handcuffs in the course of an investigatory stop does not automatically convert the encounter into a de facto arrest\"). As the court had previously found, Officer Alverio briefly drew his weapon out of Fornia's view and for defensive purposes only. Similarly, based on Officer Alverio's testimony, the district court found that \"reasonable safety concerns permeated the [officer's] decision to use [handcuffs].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While an officer's drawing of his gun and use of handcuffs might in some situations weigh more heavily in favor of a finding that a detention has escalated into a de facto arrest, the district court found that numerous other factors weighed against such a determination in Fornia's case. Specifically, the court observed that the stop took place at the side of \"a busy public street with a heavy volume of traffic,\" and that, initially, Officer Alverio \"was the only officer on the scene.\" In addition, the court found that \"the handcuffs were removed when other surveillance team members arrived, and only remained on [Fornia] for ten or fifteen minutes.\" Finally, the court noted that \"the interaction between the . . . officers and Fornia was not confrontational or bellicose.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These factual findings were not clearly erroneous. Based on these findings, the court supportably came to the ultimate conclusion that Fornia's detention was a valid investigatory stop that did not require <i>Miranda</i> warnings. While a reasonable person in Fornia's situation would certainly have understood that he was under investigation for a crime, the stop, given the facts as found by the district court, \"lacked the coercive element necessary to convert it into something more draconian,\" based on the totality of the circumstances. <i>Ngai Man Lee,</i> 317 F.3d at 32. The district court thus properly denied Fornia's motion to suppress his statements on the ground that they were obtained as a result of a violation of his Fifth Amendment right to protection against self-incrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his pro se brief, Fornia claims that he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel at his suppression hearing. Under the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), to establish such a violation, \"a defendant must show that counsel performed unreasonably and that prejudice resulted therefrom.\" <i>United States v. Mena-Robles,</i> 4 F.3d 1026, 1034 (1st Cir.1993). Fornia alleges that his pretrial counsel performed deficiently by denying him the opportunity to exercise his constitutional right to testify at his suppression hearing, which resulted in the denial of his motion to suppress evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record on appeal, however, is devoid of facts relating to Fornia's interactions with counsel, including whether counsel informed Fornia of his right to testify at his suppression hearing, informed him of the constitutional nature of that right, or somehow coerced him into forgoing the exercise of that right. <i>See Lema v. United States,</i> 987 F.2d 48, 52-53 (1st Cir.1993) (discussing considerations for determining whether defense counsel coerced or merely advised client regarding decision whether to testify). Because the record is insufficiently developed to permit \"reasoned consideration of the ineffective assistance claim,\" <i>United States v. Glenn,</i> 389 F.3d 283, 287 (1st Cir.2004), Fornia may raise such a claim only on collateral attack in a proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255. <i>See United States v. Genao,</i> 281 F.3d 305, 313 (1st Cir.2002). We therefore dismiss his ineffective assistance of counsel claim without prejudice to the filing of a &#167; 2255 petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Constructive Amendment/Prejudicial Variance</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fornia alleges that the government constructively amended the indictment in 196 by introducing evidence of the conspiracy alleged in 1528 to prove the conspiracy charged in 196 &#8212; in effect, trying him for an offense other than that alleged in 196 &#8212; in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to presentment of charges to a grand jury. The government argues that Fornia has forfeited his claim of constructive amendment through failure to object to the introduction of evidence on that ground or to seek a continuance or mistrial below. As we have explained, however, after the government rested its case, Fornia's counsel moved for an acquittal on the ground that the conspiracy the government had attempted to prove in 196 was indistinguishable from that charged in 1528 and that the evidence was therefore insufficient to prove the conspiracy charged in 196. In his motion for a new trial, Fornia also argued that he had been prejudiced at trial by the government's failure to clarify which of the two charged conspiracies it was attempting to prove in 196. Fornia's claim is thus preserved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Presentment Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that \"[n]o person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury\" (with exceptions not relevant to this case). Accordingly, \"after an indictment has been returned[,] its charges may not be broadened through amendment except by the grand jury itself.\" <i>Stirone v. United States,</i> 361 U.S. 212, 215-16, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960) (citing <i>Ex Parte Bain,</i> 121 U.S. 1, 7 S.Ct. 781, 30 L.Ed. 849 (1887)). An indictment has been constructively amended in violation of the Presentment Clause \"when the charging terms of the indictment are altered, either literally or in effect, by prosecution or court after the grand jury has last passed upon them.\" <i>United States v. Fisher,</i> 3 F.3d 456, 462 (1st Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Such an amendment may occur through the \"admission of evidence of an offense not charged by the grand jury.\" <i>United States v. Dunn,</i> 758 F.2d 30, 35 (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fornia argues specifically that the government tried him for the offense of participating in a conspiracy in which he was an \"owner of drugs,\" as charged in 1528, as opposed to the conspiracy charged in 196, in which he was identified as a \"transporter[] of drug[s] or money\" and another individual was identified as the only \"head and owner drug point.\" However, the statutory offense charged against Fornia in 196, and the offense the government proved at trial, was conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846. Role in the conspiracy is not an element of that offense. Thus, Fornia's claim does not involve an alleged constructive amendment of 196 to include \"an offense not charged by the grand jury,\" <i>Dunn,</i> 758 F.2d at 35, but rather an alleged variance from the indictment, which \"occurs when the charging terms remain unchanged but when the facts proved at trial are different from those alleged in the indictment,\" <i>Fisher,</i> 3 F.3d at 463.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though related, claims of constructive amendment and prejudicial variance differ in at least one important respect. \"A constructive amendment is considered prejudicial per se and grounds for reversal of a conviction.\" <i>Id.</i> By contrast, \"[v]ariance is grounds for reversal only if it affected the defendant's substantial rights.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). In short, \"[s]o long as the statutory violation remains the same, the jury can convict even if the facts found are somewhat different than those charged &#8212; so long as the difference does not cause unfair prejudice.\" <i>United States v. Twitty,</i> 72 F.3d 228, 231 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fornia argues that the government's proof at trial impermissibly varied from the allegations in 196 by establishing that his role in the alleged conspiracy was not that of a \"transporter[] of drug[s] or money\" in someone else's drug distribution operation, but that of an \"owner of drugs,\" which Fornia sold to Torres, who, in turn, sold them to co-conspirators indicted in 196. Indeed, while the government introduced evidence that Fornia literally \"transport[ed]\" drug proceeds in the trunk of his car, the government introduced no evidence whatsoever that Fornia \"transport[ed]\" the cash in the trunk of his car to or for anyone else. Rather, Torres testified that it was he who distributed the cocaine he purchased from Fornia to the individual identified in the indictment as #1, \"head and owner drug point,\" and other indicted co-conspirators. Torres also testified that he then collected cash from other co-conspirators and delivered it to Fornia as partial payment for the cocaine Fornia had supplied. Because the government's evidence of Fornia's role in the conspiracy differed from the role of a \"transporter[] of drug[s] or money\" in a conspiracy in which another individual was identified as the \"head and owner drug point,\" as alleged in the indictment in 196, there was a variance between the government's proof at trial and the charge alleged in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, Fornia fails to establish any prejudice resulting from the variance. The question \"whether a variance affected a defendant's substantial rights\" is subject to <i>de novo</i> review. <i>United States v. Wihbey,</i> 75 F.3d 761, 774 (1st Cir.1996). Fornia points out that the grand jury that returned the indictment in 196 never had an opportunity to assess the government's evidence that he was an owner of drugs, since the government acknowledges that it discovered the facts alleged in 1528 only after 196 had already been returned.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> Fornia's argument misapprehends the nature of the substantial rights protected by the prohibition on prejudicial variance from an indictment, namely, the rights to \"have sufficient knowledge of the charge against [one] in order to prepare an effective defense and avoid surprise at trial, and to prevent a second prosecution for the same offense.\" <i>United States v. Tormos-Vega,</i> 959 F.2d 1103, 1115 (1st Cir.1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record shows that Fornia had ample notice of and ample opportunity to prepare to meet the government's evidence before trial. \"The government need not recite all of its evidence in the indictment, nor is it limited at trial to the overt acts listed in the indictment.\" <i>United States v. Innamorati,</i> 996 F.2d 456, 477 (1st Cir.1993). Here, however, prior to trial, the government disclosed its intention to introduce evidence in 196 relating to Fornia's ownership of drugs as alleged in 1528.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> That evidence was relevant to central factual disputes in 196, for example, whether the money in Fornia's trunk represented drug proceeds (as distinct from legal business proceeds), and whether Fornia shared an interest in the sales and distribution activities of others. Further, Fornia's particular role in the conspiracy alleged in 196 was unrelated to his defense theory; rather, Fornia was well aware that his \"central defense [in 196] needed to be that he was not part of [the] organization &#8212; as a [transporter of drug proceeds, owner of drugs], or in any other capacity.\" <i>United States v. Alicea-Cardoza,</i> 132 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1997) (no impermissible variance where defendant was indicted \"for being a conspirator/triggerman but the evidence proved him a conspirator/runner\"). Accordingly, Fornia was not misled by the government's evidence at trial to \"defend himself on the wrong grounds.\" <i>Id.</i> Fornia was thus able to \"prepare an effective defense and avoid surprise at trial.\" <i>Tormos-Vega,</i> 959 F.2d at 1115.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the trial court detected the potential for prejudice to Fornia's ability to avoid a successive prosecution for the same offense based on the government's introduction of evidence relating to the charges in 1528 &#8212; including evidence of Fornia's role in that conspiracy &#8212; to prove the conspiracy charged in 196. However, as we discuss below in Part III, any such prejudice was cured by the government's dismissal of the conspiracy count in 1528. Because the variance failed to affect Fornia's substantial rights, we reject his challenge to his conviction in 196 on the ground of constructive amendment or prejudicial variance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. 1528 DOUBLE JEOPARDY CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fornia appeals the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment in 1528 on double jeopardy grounds. The government argues that Fornia has waived his double jeopardy claim by objecting to its motion to consolidate the cases for trial, thereby \"elect[ing] to have the two offenses tried separately and persuad[ing] the trial court to honor his election.\" <i>Jeffers v. United States,</i> 432 U.S. 137, 152, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977) (plurality op.). While the record is silent on Fornia's reasons for objecting to the government's motion, which was made during a pre-trial conference three days before Fornia's trial began in 196, Fornia maintains on appeal that his objection was based solely on his inability to prepare to try both cases on such short notice rather than as an attempt to \"persuade\" the trial court of his \"election\" to face separate trials. <i>Id.</i> The government points out that Fornia could have sought a continuance. In denying the government's motion, however, Judge Carter, who was sitting in Puerto Rico by special designation for a limited period of time, clearly announced his intention \"to try this case,\" meaning the 196 indictment. Under these circumstances, we treat Fornia's claim as preserved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The availability of double jeopardy protection is a constitutional question reviewable <i>de novo. United States v. Lanoue,</i> 137 F.3d 656, 661 (1st Cir.1998). Under the Fifth Amendment, no person shall \"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" Among the purposes for double jeopardy protection is the prevention of \"repeated prosecutions for the same offense,\" <i>Oregon v. Kennedy,</i> 456 U.S. 667, 671, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982), pursuant to \"a constitutional policy of finality for the defendant's benefit,\" <i>United States v. Jorn,</i> 400 U.S. 470, 479, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971) (plurality op.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fornia's double jeopardy claim is narrow in scope. While the Double Jeopardy Clause protects against \"the danger that, in conspiracy cases, the government might . . . partition[] a single conspiracy into separate prosecutions\" by prohibiting successive prosecutions for conspiracies with identical features, <i>United States v. Morris,</i> 99 F.3d 476, 480 (1st Cir.1996), Fornia ultimately faced only one conspiracy prosecution because the second conspiracy count against him was eventually dismissed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> Fornia therefore does not allege that he was prosecuted twice for the same violation of the same statute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does Fornia make the futile argument that he could not be successively prosecuted in 1528 for substantive drug offenses that were the objects of a drug conspiracy for which Fornia had already been prosecuted in 196. Under the traditional test announced in <i>Blockburger v. United States,</i> 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), \"where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\" Fornia's sequential prosecutions under different statutes fully satisfy the <i>Blockburger</i> test. \"In order to establish a violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, the Government need not prove the commission of any overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Shabani,</i> 513 U.S. 10, 15, 115 S.Ct. 382, 130 L.Ed.2d 225 (1994). Conversely, no agreement need be proven to secure a conviction for a substantive drug offense under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). Indeed, it has long been established that \"conspiracy to commit a crime is not the same offense as the substantive crime for double jeopardy purposes,\" <i>Lanoue,</i> 137 F.3d at 662, because \"the agreement to do the act is distinct from the [completed] act itself,\" <i>United States v. Felix,</i> 503 U.S. 378, 390-91, 112 S.Ct. 1377, 118 L.Ed.2d 25 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted) (adhering to line of cases holding that separate prosecutions for conspiracy and for underlying substantive offenses do not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fornia attempts to reach shelter under the Double Jeopardy Clause by a different route. He points out that the Supreme Court has suggested that even where a successive prosecution would otherwise be barred under the <i>Blockburger</i> test, such a prosecution may nevertheless be permissible under the Double Jeopardy Clause where \"the additional facts necessary to sustain [a subsequent] charge ha[d] not [yet] occurred or ha[d] not [yet] been discovered despite the exercise of due diligence\" at the time of the first prosecution. <i>Brown v. Ohio,</i> 432 U.S. 161, 169 n. 7, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977). Fornia asks us to fashion a new rule by holding that the Double Jeopardy Clause also <i>prohibits</i> successive prosecutions that would <i>not</i> otherwise be barred under the <i>Blockburger</i> test where, in the exercise of due diligence, the government could have brought the prosecutions in the same proceeding. <i>See</i> Fed R.Crim. P. 8(a) (permitting joinder of charges against a defendant in the same indictment \"if the offenses charged . . . are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fornia's proposed rule is a barely disguised attempt to resurrect the \"same transaction\" test for determining when successive prosecutions are barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Such a test, \"which would require the Government to try together all offenses (regardless of the differences in the statutes) based on one event,\" has been \"consistently rejected by the [Supreme] Court.\" <i>United States v. Dixon,</i> 509 U.S. 688, 709 n. 14, 113 S.Ct. 2849, 125 L.Ed.2d 556 (1993). Instead, \"the performance of a <i>Blockburger</i> analysis completes the judicial task in a successive prosecution case.\" <i>Morris,</i> 99 F.3d at 480. Even where, as in Fornia's cases, prosecutions for different offenses may be suitable for joinder, successive prosecutions are permitted under the Double Jeopardy Clause so long as the offenses pass the <i>Blockburger</i> test, with its \"focus[] on the statutory elements of each offense.\" <i>United States v. Colon-Osorio,</i> 10 F.3d 41, 43 (1st Cir.1993). We therefore reject Fornia's claim that his prosecution in 1528 was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause solely because the government, in the exercise of due diligence, could have brought the charges in a superseding indictment or could have more promptly moved to consolidate 196 and 1528 for trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. SENTENCING IN 196 AND 1528</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 846 and 841(b)(1)(A), Fornia was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment and a maximum term of life imprisonment for each of his convictions, given the jury's finding in 196 and his admissions in his guilty pleas in 1528 that the quantity of cocaine involved in each offense exceeded 5 kilograms. Under the federal Sentencing Guidelines, Fornia's sentence in each case was limited to a narrower Guidelines Sentencing Range (\"GSR\") based on an assessment of his Criminal History Category and a total offense level calculated by identifying a \"`base offense level' corresponding to the crime for which [he was] convicted, as modified by mandatory `adjustments' which take into account certain aggravating or mitigating factors.\" <i>United States v. Austin,</i> 239 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount the facts pertinent to Fornia's sentencing as gleaned from \"uncontested portions of the presentence investigation report[s] and the transcript[s] of the sentencing hearing[s].\" <i>United States v. Cloutier,</i> 966 F.2d 24, 25 (1st Cir.1992). On the morning of December 5, 2002, the court held a sentencing hearing in 196. The court calculated Fornia's base offense level as 34 for a drug offense involving 21 kilograms of cocaine. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(a)(3). The court arrived at this 21-kilogram figure by dividing the total amount of drug proceeds seized from Fornia ($281,926) by the amount Torres testified that he paid Fornia per kilogram of cocaine ($13,000), as recommended in the presentence investigation report (\"PSR\") for 196. The court then found that Fornia had been \"a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(b), warranting a three-level upward adjustment to reach a total offense level of 37. The court declined to impose an enhancement sought by the government for the specific offense characteristic of possession of a firearm. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1). The court also declined to impose an acceptance of responsibility downward adjustment because Fornia had gone to trial in 196. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, cmt. n. 2 (adjustment for acceptance of responsibility generally unavailable to defendant who \"puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt\"). The court then sentenced Fornia to the minimum sentence, 210 months' imprisonment, within the appropriate GSR for an offender in Criminal History Category I (210-262 months), and imposed a fine of $5000 and a five-year term of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that afternoon, the court held a separate sentencing hearing in 1528. The court determined that the quantity of drugs involved in all conduct relevant to the charged offenses was the sum total of the amounts involved in the four substantive counts in 1528, or 170 kilograms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> Following the recommendation of the PSR in 1528, the court reasoned that \"21 of those kilograms were the subject of the . . . sentence in [196]\" and had already been accounted for by that sentence. Accordingly, the court used the remaining quantity, 149 kilograms, to calculate a base offense level of 36 in 1528. The court then found that Fornia \"was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a), warranting a four-level upward adjustment to reach a total offense level of 40. The court also found, based on the government's representation and the description in the PSR prepared in 1528, that two indicted co-conspirators who had pled guilty in 1528 had placed Fornia in possession of a firearm during a drug-related incident. The court accordingly imposed a two-level enhancement for the specific offense characteristic of possession of a firearm during a drug offense, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1), reaching a total offense level of 42. Because Fornia pled guilty to the four counts in 1528, however, the court imposed a three-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b), lowering the total offense level to 39. Finally, based on Fornia's \"prior undischarged sentence\" imposed that morning in 196, the court awarded three criminal history points to place Fornia in Criminal History Category II. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1(a). The court then sentenced Fornia to the maximum sentence, 365 months' imprisonment, within the applicable GSR (292-365 months), to run concurrently as to the four substantive counts, but consecutive to the sentence of 210 months' imprisonment in 196, for a total term of imprisonment in both cases of just under 48 years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> The court also imposed a fine of $250,000 and a five-year term of supervised release to run concurrently with the term of supervised release imposed in 196. The court declined Fornia's request for a downward departure on the basis of alleged prosecutorial misconduct.

Specifically, Fornia argues that: (1) the district court imposed mandatory sentence enhancements based solely on judicially found facts, increasing the sentence in each case beyond the maximum authorized by jury-found or admitted facts in violation of <i>Booker;</i> (2) the court erred by failing to use the same drug quantity involved in the conspiracy in 196, 21 kilograms, to sentence Fornia on the four substantive counts in 1528 because the cases involved related conduct, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G &#167; 1B1.3; (3) the court imposed a consecutive rather than a concurrent term of imprisonment in 1528, including role-in-the-offense sentence enhancements based on the same conduct in each case, in violation of Fornia's Fifth Amendment rights to due process and protection against double jeopardy; (4) the court improperly assigned criminal history points on the basis of Fornia's sentence for the conspiracy conviction in 196 to increase his sentence in 1528, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2; (5) the court improperly denied Fornia's motion to consolidate his cases for sentencing and failed to group the counts in both indictments, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 3D1.1-3D1.5 and 5G1.2(b)-(c); (6) the role-in-the-offense sentence enhancement in 196 violates the Presentment Clause of the Fifth Amendment; and (7) the evidence was insufficient to support, by a preponderance of the evidence, the court's imposition of role-in-the-offense enhancements in both 196 and 1528, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, and the \"specific offense characteristic\" enhancement for possession of a firearm in 1528, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1).

As our description of Fornia's multiple claims of Guidelines error suggests, the Guidelines sentencing here was complex. In response, the court imposed the minimum sentence under the GSR for the conspiracy conviction in 196, the maximum sentence under the GSR for the convictions on the four substantive offenses in 1528 (with those sentences being concurrent to each other), and then made the maximum sentence consecutive to the minimum sentence. On its face, this mixture of leniency and stringency is unusual, and the reasons for these choices are not entirely clear. This observation is not a criticism. The court faced a particularly difficult sentencing problem because the closely related cases were prosecuted and sentenced in separate proceedings, requiring the court to treat Fornia's cases as simultaneously related, yet separate, for purposes of sentencing within the confines of a mandatory Guidelines regime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the court appears to have been mindful of the desirability of mitigating the consequences of the government's decision to bring successive prosecutions against Fornia in its subtraction of 21 kilograms of cocaine from the total quantity involved in the offenses in 1528 because that portion had already been \"the subject of the . . . sentence in [196].\" The Guidelines encourage such attention to the potential unfairness of duplicative punishment resulting solely from prosecutorial charging decisions. For example, U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3, under which Fornia was sentenced to a consecutive term of imprisonment in 1528, \"was designed `to mitigate the possibility that the fortuity of two separate prosecutions will grossly increase a defendant's sentence.'\" <i>United States v.

Fornia-Castillo was indicted, tried, and convicted on a single count of conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846. He then sought to dismiss, on double jeopardy grounds, a second indictment charging him with another count of conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 and four substantive counts of possession with intent to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A), and aiding and abetting others in those offenses in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. After the government dismissed the second conspiracy count, the court denied Fornia's motion to dismiss the second indictment. Fornia then pled guilty to each of the four remaining substantive offense counts, expressly reserving his right to appeal those convictions on double jeopardy grounds. Fornia was sentenced in separate hearings to consecutive terms of 210 months' imprisonment for the conspiracy conviction and 365 months' imprisonment for the four substantive counts (to run concurrently to each other), for a total term of imprisonment of approximately 48 years. Fornia appeals his convictions and sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to his conspiracy conviction, Fornia argues that: (1) the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress evidence obtained in violation of his Fourth Amendment right to protection against unreasonable searches and seizures and his Fifth Amendment right to protection against self-incrimination; (2) his pre-trial counsel rendered constitutionally defective representation at his suppression hearing in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel; and (3) the government violated his Fifth Amendment right to indictment by a grand jury by constructively amending the indictment after its presentment to the grand jury. With respect to his pleas to the substantive offenses, Fornia argues that the prosecution was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment because the government failed to exercise due diligence either by seeking a superseding indictment to the initial conspiracy charge or by promptly joining both cases for prosecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Fornia also assigns numerous errors to his sentences, including the claim that the court imposed mandatory sentence enhancements in each case based solely on judicial fact-finding, thereby increasing the maximum sentence otherwise authorized by jury-found or admitted facts in violation of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We reserve further details for our analysis of Fornia's individual claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the afternoon of September 9, 1999, Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") Task Force agents conducting visual surveillance of suspected drug conspirators outside a furniture store witnessed several people entering and exiting the store with small boxes and bags that the agents had reason to believe contained illegal drugs or drug proceeds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Later that day, two suspects left the store carrying a large bag, which they placed in the trunk of a car. Agents followed the two men as they drove the car from the furniture store to a bakery, where they met a third man unknown to the agents, who was later identified as Fornia. The agents observed the men transferring the contents of the car trunk to the trunk of Fornia's car, and began following Fornia as he drove away from the bakery alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At around 7:45 PM, agents instructed a member of the Task Force who was a local police officer in uniform to pull Fornia over under the pretense of investigating a report of a car stolen from a nearby shopping center whose description matched Fornia's car. After identifying Fornia through his driver's license and car registration, the officer obtained Fornia's consent to search the car, including a garbage bag in the trunk, which contained several smaller bags and a shoe box, all filled with large amounts of cash. Once the officer saw the cash, he handcuffed Fornia and frisked him, finding no weapon.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> While Fornia was handcuffed, the officer signaled for assistance from two local police officers who were not part of the Task Force but who happened to be patrolling the area. Fornia remained handcuffed until another Task Force member arrived on the scene, pretending to be another police officer in charge of security at the shopping center parking lot, and ordered the handcuffs removed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The newly arrived agent informed Fornia that the money would have to be turned over either to the tax authorities, who would take the cash, deduct a portion, and return the remainder to Fornia by check, or, in the alternative, to the DEA. Fornia stated several times that he would prefer to turn the money over to the tax authorities, observing that their procedure resembled money laundering. Instead, the officers awaited the arrival of DEA agents, all of whom were members of the Task Force investigating the suspected drug conspiracy. When the DEA agents arrived, they told Fornia that he was not under arrest for carrying a large quantity of cash. The agents questioned Fornia about his recent whereabouts and asked where he was going with the large amount of cash. Fornia did not mention that he had been at the bakery, but replied that he had bought coffee at the shopping center and that he was bringing the money to his mother-in-law's house to be stored. The agents then seized the money and asked Fornia to go to the DEA office for further questioning. Fornia agreed and drove his own car to the DEA office, where he answered additional questions. Fornia was then given a receipt for the cash and left the DEA office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 26, 2000, a federal grand jury returned a sealed indictment (\"I96\") charging 26 named individuals, including Fornia, and unknown co-conspirators with a solitary count of conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 during a time period beginning \"not later than the summer of 1997\" and continuing through the date of the indictment. The indictment assigned each named individual a number and described his or her alleged role within the conspiracy. Fornia, #21, was included among # 16-23 as \"transporters of drug[s] or money.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The indictment also alleged 74 overt acts, \"among others,\" committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. Fornia's name appeared only once in the list of overt acts, in paragraph 50, which alleged that \"[o]n September 9, 1999, (2) Fernando TORRES-Fernandez and (20) Osvaldo VILLEGAS-Rivera delivered to (21) Luis FORNIA-Castillo approximately Two Hundred Eighty-One Thousand and Nine Hundred Twenty-Six Dollars ($281,926.00) of drug proceeds\" (emphasis omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment was unsealed on May 1, 2000, and Fornia was arrested on a warrant that day. He was later released on bail. On December 27, 2000, Fornia moved to suppress the evidence, including his statements, obtained as a result of the September 9, 1999 stop and search of his car and his subsequent interview at the DEA office. After an evidentiary hearing before Judge Casellas on February 5-6, 2001, the motion was denied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> By March 2001, each of Fornia's 25 co-defendants in I96 had pled guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 1, 2001, a federal grand jury returned a sealed indictment (\"I528\") charging 15 named individuals, including Fornia and one other person who had also been indicted in I96,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and others unknown, with conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 during a time period beginning \"on or about the end part of 1996\" and continuing through the date of the indictment. As in I96, all of the conduct alleged against Fornia in I528 took place no earlier than \"the summer of 1997.\" I528 identified Fornia as #1, \"owner of drugs.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The indictment also charged Fornia with four additional counts alleging substantive offenses in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A), and aiding and abetting others in those offenses in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. The substantive offenses were also alleged as overt acts #4-6 and #10 committed in furtherance of the conspiracy charged in Count One.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, Count Two alleged that Fornia, indicted co-conspirators # 2 and #6, and an unindicted co-conspirator possessed with intent to distribute approximately 50 kilograms of cocaine \"[o]n or about the end part of 1997.\" Count Three alleged that Fornia, the same indicted co-conspirators, and an unindicted co-conspirator possessed with intent to distribute the same quantity of cocaine \"[o]n or about the beginning of 1998.\" Count Four alleged that Fornia, indicted co-conspirator #3, and an unindicted co-conspirator possessed with intent to distribute approximately 40 kilograms of cocaine \"[o]n or about August[] 1999,\" and Count Five alleged that Fornia and an unindicted co-conspirator possessed with intent to distribute approximately 30 kilograms of cocaine \"[o]n or about October[] 1999.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Additional overt acts alleged in furtherance of the conspiracy included three instances of drug-related payments, including an expanded version of paragraph 50 of I96 alleging that \"[o]n September 9, 1999, . . . OSVALDO VILLEGAS RIVERA[] and an unindicted co-conspirator delivered to . . . LUIS B. FORNIA-CASTILLO approximately $281,926.00 of drug proceeds, money related to over[t] acts Nos. 6 and 7 herein\" (emphasis omitted). The money was also related to the facts alleged in support of the substantive offense charged in Count Three. Fornia was arrested on the second set of charges on August 30, 2001 and held without bail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 15, 2002, more than eight months later and during the week when Fornia's jury trial in I96 was scheduled to begin before Judge Carter (who was sitting by designation), the government moved at a pre-trial status conference, over Fornia's objection, to consolidate I96 and I528 for trial and sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Judge Carter denied the motion, stating: \"We are going to try this case.\" In a written motion filed the next day upon the court's instruction, the government explained its reasons for seeking joinder and for seeking a second indictment instead of a superseding indictment in I96:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The counts contained in both indictment[s] could have been joined in the same indictment since they are of the same or similar character pursuant to Fed. R. Crim P. 8(a). However, since [by] August 1, 2001, [the date on which the second indictment was returned,] all the codefendants with the exception of codefendant Luis B. Fornia-Castillo in [I96] had already pled guilty[,] the government elected to file a separate indictment against fourteen (14) additional co-defendants in lieu of supersed[ing] the indictment in [I96].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fornia's trial in I96 began two days later, on April 18, 2002, and continued for five days. The government's first witness was a member of the DEA Task Force who described the events depicted on a surveillance videotape, including the arrival and departure of suspected co-conspirators at the furniture store on September 9, 1999, the two co-conspirators' rendezvous with Fornia at the bakery, and the subsequent discovery of the bags of cash in Fornia's trunk by investigators during the stop and search of his car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then called an indicted co-conspirator, Fernando Torres-Fernandez, who had pled guilty in I96, as a cooperating witness. Torres testified that sometime in late 1997, Fornia asked him if he had any contacts at the airport who could assist in shipping cocaine to New York. According to Torres, he and two other co-conspirators then met with Fornia to arrange a test shipment of 50 kilograms of cocaine to New York.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Torres testified that when the test shipment, which also involved a fifth individual who worked at the local airport, proved successful, the same group of four co-conspirators arranged a second shipment of more than 50 kilograms of cocaine to New York.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The second shipment, however, never arrived at its destination, according to Torres, because the airport worker had been killed and the cocaine lost. Torres testified that the four co-conspirators had gone to the airport several times to try to find the killer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Torres' testimony, Fornia's counsel objected several times on hearsay grounds to Torres' reports of statements made by other alleged co-conspirators. After one such objection, the court took judicial notice of the indictment in I528, which was pending before Judge P&#233;rez-Gim&#233;nez. Because the events Torres described were alleged only in I528, and the co-conspirators to whom Torres referred were indicted only in I528, the court asked the government whether it could show that the co-conspirators were also participants in the conspiracy charged in I96 for purposes of admitting their hearsay statements. The court then asked: \"Why have you indicted in two separate indictments, alleging in the indictment all of these transactions in case number 528, and now you are proving those acts and transactions in a separate case, this one bearing number 96. I don't understand what you are trying to do.\" The government responded that \"at the time [I96 and I528] were indicted, they were separate conspirac[ies].\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> The court warned, \"You can't convict the same defendant two times [for the same conspiracy].\" The court then permitted the government to proceed with its direct examination of Torres, advising the government that it would not admit co-conspirator hearsay \"until you tell me that you can connect those co-conspirators to this conspiracy and not just to the other [one in I528].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres next testified that on September 9, 1999, he had collected money from several people in order to pay Fornia for about 40 kilograms of cocaine Torres had purchased from him at a price of $13,000 per kilogram. Torres testified that the cash seized from Fornia later that same day represented partial payment for the drugs after successful resale.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Torres also identified a paper bag and a shoe box that had been used to hold the cash, and identified his handwriting on the containers recording the amount of cash held in each. Torres went on to state that on September 10, 1999, Fornia had informed him that the cash had been seized by the DEA the previous day, but that Fornia planned to recover the cash through a suppression motion or by characterizing the money as proceeds from his legal motorcycle business. Torres then described new installment payment procedures Fornia devised for receiving future payments in order to avoid the possibility of any additional seizures of large amounts of cash. Finally, Torres described one additional incident that took place after September 9, 1999, in which Fornia supplied him with about 30 kilograms of cocaine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the government rested its case, Fornia moved for an acquittal. His counsel stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">because this case . . . involved a conspiratorial time period that would overlap with [1528], it appears that the evidence that has been brought here is partially from [1528] and . . . because of that, I don't know how we can decide whether this particular conspiracy has been set forth with all of the elements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court asked the government how, in the event Fornia was convicted in 196, he would \"prove[] in the other court that he has already been convicted of the same conduct that he is charged with [in 1528]?\" In response, the government continued to assert that the conspiracy alleged in 1528 was different from the one for which Fornia was being tried in 196. Eventually, however, the government represented that it would request dismissal of the conspiracy count against Fornia in 1528.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 24, 2002, the jury found Fornia guilty of conspiracy and found that the quantity of cocaine involved in the offense exceeded five kilograms. On April 26, 2002, Fornia moved for a new trial alleging that \"the government's failure to provide required pretrial disclosure materially prejudiced [his] right to a fair trial\" and that \"by falsely indicting and prosecuting [Fornia] for two conspiracies when it knew there was only one, the government deprived [him] of a fair trial.\" On June 6, 2002, Fornia also moved in 196 to \"confirm consolidation\" of his cases on the ground that, <i>inter alia,</i> they involved the same alleged conspiracy. The government opposed Fornia's motion to confirm consolidation of the cases, arguing that: (1) consolidation had already been denied; (2) \"no substantial public interest [would] be promoted\" by consolidation \"[a]t this stage of the proceedings\"; and (3) Fornia was estopped from seeking consolidation or had waived the claim because he had opposed the government's earlier motion, filed on the eve of trial, to consolidate the cases. On June 25, 2002, Judge Carter denied both Fornia's motion for a new trial and his motion to confirm consolidation of the cases, noting that any double jeopardy concerns could adequately be addressed by Judge P&#233;rez-Gim&#233;nez in 1528.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 1, 2002, Fornia filed a motion to dismiss 1528 on double jeopardy grounds. As promised, the government dismissed the conspiracy count against Fornia in 1528 on July 3, 2002. Fornia then moved in 1528 for a change of plea.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> At the change-of-plea hearing on July 15, 2002, Judge P&#233;rez-Gim&#233;nez denied Fornia's motion to dismiss 1528. Fornia then pled guilty to the four remaining counts charging him with substantive drug offenses. Although Fornia did not enter into a plea agreement with the government, he expressly reserved the right to appeal his conviction in 1528 on double jeopardy grounds, citing <i>Menna v. New York,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109330\"><a href=\"/opinion/109330/menna-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 62-63, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109330\"><a href=\"/opinion/109330/menna-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Fornia moved in 1528 to consolidate both cases for sentencing on October 25, 2002, but Judge P&#233;rez-Gim&#233;nez denied the motion. On the morning of December 5, 2002, Judge P&#233;rez-Gim&#233;nez sentenced Fornia in 196 to 210 months' imprisonment. That afternoon, in a separate sentencing hearing, the court sentenced Fornia in 1528 to 365 months' imprisonment to run concurrently as to the four substantive counts, but consecutive to the sentence in 196.

When Fornia began to open the bag, Officer Alverio testified that he drew his gun in a \"defensive position\" &#8212; out of Fornia's visual range and pointing at the ground &#8212; because it was too dark for him to be able to see whether the trunk contained any weapons. The district court determined that Officer Alverio \"provided credible undisputed testimony that Fornia voluntarily agreed to allow him to search the vehicle and to examine the trunk.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> The court specifically found that the officer \"kept [the gun] out of Fornia's view[] and at his side, and placed it back in his holster when Fornia stepped away from the trunk, all of which were confirmed by the [surveillance] video\" played during the hearing.

Officer Alverio explained that he did not remove the handcuffs even after the local police officers arrived on the scene to assist him because he did not know the officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fornia argues that the totality of the circumstances establishes that the stop of his car, while initially a valid investigatory stop, escalated into a de facto arrest triggering the need for <i>Miranda</i> warnings. Fornia maintains that the combination of the officer's display of a gun, his use of handcuffs and a pat-down search, and his explanation that he was investigating a car theft would have led a reasonable person to believe he was effectively under arrest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> In particular, Fornia argues that he was subjected to custodial interrogation because Officer Alverio questioned him while he was handcuffed. Indeed, Officer Alverio testified during the suppression hearing that he asked Fornia where the money in his trunk had come from while Fornia was handcuffed, and that Fornia responded that the money was from his motorcycle business. While the government did not introduce this particular statement at trial, Fornia maintains that the statements he made after the handcuffs were removed in response to questioning by other Task Force agents should have been suppressed because they were derived from the same <i>Miranda</i> violation. <i>See United States v. Byram,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197962\"><a href=\"/opinion/197962/united-states-v-byram/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span>, 409-10 (1st Cir.1998) (\"where the <i>Miranda</i> violation is not merely technical, where there is a substantial nexus between the violation and the second statement, and where the second statement is not itself preceded by an adequate <i>Miranda</i> warning,\" suppression of subsequent voluntary statements may be warranted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that Fornia was not subjected to custodial interrogation at any time during the stop and therefore that no <i>Miranda</i> violation occurred. The court recognized \"two arguably coercive facts\" in support of Fornia's <i>Miranda</i> violation claims: Officer Alverio's drawing of his gun and his use of handcuffs. As the court correctly noted, however, neither the use of handcuffs nor the drawing of a weapon necessarily transforms a valid <i>Terry</i> stop into a de facto arrest. <i>Trueber,</i> 238 F.3d at 94 (officer's drawing of weapon while asking suspected narcotics trafficker to step out of vehicle at night does not transform entire investigatory stop into de facto arrest); <i>United States v. Acosta-Colon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198134\"><a href=\"/opinion/198134/united-states-v-acosta-colon/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.1998) (the \"use of handcuffs in the course of an investigatory stop does not automatically convert the encounter into a de facto arrest\"). As the court had previously found, Officer Alverio briefly drew his weapon out of Fornia's view and for defensive purposes only. Similarly, based on Officer Alverio's testimony, the district court found that \"reasonable safety concerns permeated the [officer's] decision to use [handcuffs].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While an officer's drawing of his gun and use of handcuffs might in some situations weigh more heavily in favor of a finding that a detention has escalated into a de facto arrest, the district court found that numerous other factors weighed against such a determination in Fornia's case. Specifically, the court observed that the stop took place at the side of \"a busy public street with a heavy volume of traffic,\" and that, initially, Officer Alverio \"was the only officer on the scene.\" In addition, the court found that \"the handcuffs were removed when other surveillance team members arrived, and only remained on [Fornia] for ten or fifteen minutes.\" Finally, the court noted that \"the interaction between the . . . officers and Fornia was not confrontational or bellicose.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These factual findings were not clearly erroneous. Based on these findings, the court supportably came to the ultimate conclusion that Fornia's detention was a valid investigatory stop that did not require <i>Miranda</i> warnings. While a reasonable person in Fornia's situation would certainly have understood that he was under investigation for a crime, the stop, given the facts as found by the district court, \"lacked the coercive element necessary to convert it into something more draconian,\" based on the totality of the circumstances. <i>Ngai Man Lee,</i> 317 F.3d at 32. The district court thus properly denied Fornia's motion to suppress his statements on the ground that they were obtained as a result of a violation of his Fifth Amendment right to protection against self-incrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

The government argues that Fornia has forfeited his claim of constructive amendment through failure to object to the introduction of evidence on that ground or to seek a continuance or mistrial below. As we have explained, however, after the government rested its case, Fornia's counsel moved for an acquittal on the ground that the conspiracy the government had attempted to prove in 196 was indistinguishable from that charged in 1528 and that the evidence was therefore insufficient to prove the conspiracy charged in 196. In his motion for a new trial, Fornia also argued that he had been prejudiced at trial by the government's failure to clarify which of the two charged conspiracies it was attempting to prove in 196.

Role in the conspiracy is not an element of that offense. Thus, Fornia's claim does not involve an alleged constructive amendment of 196 to include \"an offense not charged by the grand jury,\" <i>Dunn,</i> 758 F.2d at 35, but rather an alleged variance from the indictment, which \"occurs when the charging terms remain unchanged but when the facts proved at trial are different from those alleged in the indictment,\" <i>Fisher,</i> 3 F.3d at 463.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though related, claims of constructive amendment and prejudicial variance differ in at least one important respect. \"A constructive amendment is considered prejudicial per se and grounds for reversal of a conviction.\" <i>Id.</i> By contrast, \"[v]ariance is grounds for reversal only if it affected the defendant's substantial rights.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).

Indeed, while the government introduced evidence that Fornia literally \"transport[ed]\" drug proceeds in the trunk of his car, the government introduced no evidence whatsoever that Fornia \"transport[ed]\" the cash in the trunk of his car to or for anyone else. Rather, Torres testified that it was he who distributed the cocaine he purchased from Fornia to the individual identified in the indictment as #1, \"head and owner drug point,\" and other indicted co-conspirators. Torres also testified that he then collected cash from other co-conspirators and delivered it to Fornia as partial payment for the cocaine Fornia had supplied. Because the government's evidence of Fornia's role in the conspiracy differed from the role of a \"transporter[] of drug[s] or money\" in a conspiracy in which another individual was identified as the \"head and owner drug point,\" as alleged in the indictment in 196, there was a variance between the government's proof at trial and the charge alleged in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, Fornia fails to establish any prejudice resulting from the variance.

Under the federal Sentencing Guidelines, Fornia's sentence in each case was limited to a narrower Guidelines Sentencing Range (\"GSR\") based on an assessment of his Criminal History Category and a total offense level calculated by identifying a \"`base offense level' corresponding to the crime for which [he was] convicted, as modified by mandatory `adjustments' which take into account certain aggravating or mitigating factors.\" <i>United States v.

On the morning of December 5, 2002, the court held a sentencing hearing in 196. The court calculated Fornia's base offense level as 34 for a drug offense involving 21 kilograms of cocaine. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(a)(3). The court arrived at this 21-kilogram figure by dividing the total amount of drug proceeds seized from Fornia ($281,926) by the amount Torres testified that he paid Fornia per kilogram of cocaine ($13,000), as recommended in the presentence investigation report (\"PSR\") for 196. The court then found that Fornia had been \"a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(b), warranting a three-level upward adjustment to reach a total offense level of 37. The court declined to impose an enhancement sought by the government for the specific offense characteristic of possession of a firearm. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1). The court also declined to impose an acceptance of responsibility downward adjustment because Fornia had gone to trial in 196. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, cmt. n. 2 (adjustment for acceptance of responsibility generally unavailable to defendant who \"puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt\"). The court then sentenced Fornia to the minimum sentence, 210 months' imprisonment, within the appropriate GSR for an offender in Criminal History Category I (210-262 months), and imposed a fine of $5000 and a five-year term of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that afternoon, the court held a separate sentencing hearing in 1528. The court determined that the quantity of drugs involved in all conduct relevant to the charged offenses was the sum total of the amounts involved in the four substantive counts in 1528, or 170 kilograms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> Following the recommendation of the PSR in 1528, the court reasoned that \"21 of those kilograms were the subject of the . . . sentence in [196]\" and had already been accounted for by that sentence. Accordingly, the court used the remaining quantity, 149 kilograms, to calculate a base offense level of 36 in 1528. The court then found that Fornia \"was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a), warranting a four-level upward adjustment to reach a total offense level of 40. The court also found, based on the government's representation and the description in the PSR prepared in 1528, that two indicted co-conspirators who had pled guilty in 1528 had placed Fornia in possession of a firearm during a drug-related incident. The court accordingly imposed a two-level enhancement for the specific offense characteristic of possession of a firearm during a drug offense, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1), reaching a total offense level of 42. Because Fornia pled guilty to the four counts in 1528, however, the court imposed a three-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b), lowering the total offense level to 39. Finally, based on Fornia's \"prior undischarged sentence\" imposed that morning in 196, the court awarded three criminal history points to place Fornia in Criminal History Category II. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1(a). The court then sentenced Fornia to the maximum sentence, 365 months' imprisonment, within the applicable GSR (292-365 months), to run concurrently as to the four substantive counts, but consecutive to the sentence of 210 months' imprisonment in 196, for a total term of imprisonment in both cases of just under 48 years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> The court also imposed a fine of $250,000 and a five-year term of supervised release to run concurrently with the term of supervised release imposed in 196. The court declined Fornia's request for a downward departure on the basis of alleged prosecutorial misconduct. Finally, the court determined that no other mitigating circumstances &#8212; neither Fornia's deportability nor his allegations of disparity in his sentence as compared with those of his co-defendants &#8212; warranted a downward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fornia appeals his sentences on multiple grounds, several of which are interrelated. Specifically, Fornia argues that: (1) the district court imposed mandatory sentence enhancements based solely on judicially found facts, increasing the sentence in each case beyond the maximum authorized by jury-found or admitted facts in violation of <i>Booker;</i> (2) the court erred by failing to use the same drug quantity involved in the conspiracy in 196, 21 kilograms, to sentence Fornia on the four substantive counts in 1528 because the cases involved related conduct, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G &#167; 1B1.3; (3) the court imposed a consecutive rather than a concurrent term of imprisonment in 1528, including role-in-the-offense sentence enhancements based on the same conduct in each case, in violation of Fornia's Fifth Amendment rights to due process and protection against double jeopardy; (4) the court improperly assigned criminal history points on the basis of Fornia's sentence for the conspiracy conviction in 196 to increase his sentence in 1528, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2; (5) the court improperly denied Fornia's motion to consolidate his cases for sentencing and failed to group the counts in both indictments, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 3D1.1-3D1.5 and 5G1.2(b)-(c); (6) the role-in-the-offense sentence enhancement in 196 violates the Presentment Clause of the Fifth Amendment; and (7) the evidence was insufficient to support, by a preponderance of the evidence, the court's imposition of role-in-the-offense enhancements in both 196 and 1528, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, and the \"specific offense characteristic\" enhancement for possession of a firearm in 1528, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1).

As our description of Fornia's multiple claims of Guidelines error suggests, the Guidelines sentencing here was complex. In response, the court imposed the minimum sentence under the GSR for the conspiracy conviction in 196, the maximum sentence under the GSR for the convictions on the four substantive offenses in 1528 (with those sentences being concurrent to each other), and then made the maximum sentence consecutive to the minimum sentence. On its face, this mixture of leniency and stringency is unusual, and the reasons for these choices are not entirely clear. This observation is not a criticism. The court faced a particularly difficult sentencing problem because the closely related cases were prosecuted and sentenced in separate proceedings, requiring the court to treat Fornia's cases as simultaneously related, yet separate, for purposes of sentencing within the confines of a mandatory Guidelines regime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the court appears to have been mindful of the desirability of mitigating the consequences of the government's decision to bring successive prosecutions against Fornia in its subtraction of 21 kilograms of cocaine from the total quantity involved in the offenses in 1528 because that portion had already been \"the subject of the . . . sentence in [196].\" The Guidelines encourage such attention to the potential unfairness of duplicative punishment resulting solely from prosecutorial charging decisions. For example, U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3, under which Fornia was sentenced to a consecutive term of imprisonment in 1528, \"was designed `to mitigate the possibility that the fortuity of two separate prosecutions will grossly increase a defendant's sentence.'\" <i>United States v.
