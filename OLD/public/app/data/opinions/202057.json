Colantuono,      United States Attorney, and Aixa\nMaldonado-Quiñones, Assistant   United States Attorney, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n\n                        February 13, 2006\n\f              BOUDIN, Chief Judge.    Stephen Waweru, a Kenyan national\n\nborn in 1972, immigrated to the United States on a valid student\n\nvisa in September 1992.     He applied for asylum in November 1993 and\n\nwas placed into deportation proceedings in December 1996.            Waweru\n\nconceded deportability but sought asylum and withholding of removal\n\non the grounds that he had previously suffered persecution in Kenya\n\nbecause of his political beliefs and reasonably feared future\n\npersecution should he return.        See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13 (2005).\n\n              For reasons not fully explained, the proceedings dragged\n\non through a series of hearings from 1997 to 2000, followed by\n\nanother delay in 2002 for Waweru to obtain new counsel.             For the\n\nfinal hearing, held in September 2003, a new immigration judge\n\nreplaced the original immigration judge who had presided at the\n\nearlier proceedings.\n\n              After Kenya gained its independence in December 1963, a\n\nde facto (and later de jure) one-party state was established under\n\nthe   first    president,   Jomo   Kenyatta,    and   continued   under   his\n\nsuccessor, Daniel arap Moi.        After a change to the constitution in\n\n1991, multi-party elections were held in 1992 and 1997, but Moi won\n\nreelection both times and his party, the Kenya African National\n\nUnion (\"KANU\"), remained dominant.             Waweru testified that his\n\nmother was active in an opposition party, the Forum for the\n\nRestoration of Democracy (\"FORD\"), and convinced him to join in\n\n1988.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f                 Waweru testified that after he began to take an active\n\npart in FORD, he was subjected to threats, intimidation and--in\n\n1991       and   1992--multiple    arrests       and    beatings    because   of    his\n\nopposition to Moi.           Waweru says that his mother was also accosted\n\nand beaten by police and by youth gangs loyal to the KANU party.\n\nAfter Waweru's last arrest in May 1992, he secured a U.S. student\n\nvisa and left the country for the United States in September.                      That\n\nsame year FORD split into two factions: FORD-Kenya and FORD-Asili\n\n(to which Waweru and his family adhered).\n\n                 In October 2001, Moi said he would not run again (his\n\nterm was scheduled to end in 2003) and thereafter a number of\n\nopposition        parties    formed   an    alliance,      the     National   Rainbow\n\nCoalition        (\"NARC\"),    to   challenge      KANU    and    its   candidate    for\n\npresident.        The alliance included, according to Waweru, the FORD-\n\nKenya party and a break-away faction of KANU.                      In December 2002,\n\nthe NARC's candidate defeated Moi's designated successor and the\n\nnew regime took over the government.                   Waweru's final hearing, in\n\nSeptember 2003, understandably focused upon the recent political\n\nchanges in Kenya, acknowledged in the U.S. State Department's\n\ncountry report.1\n\n\n\n       1\n      The Board of Immigration Appeals is entitled to rely on the\nState Department's country reports as proof of country conditions\ndescribed therein, although it must also consider evidence in the\nrecord that contradicts the State Department's descriptions and\nconclusions. See, e.g., Zarouite v. Gonzales, 424 F.3d 60, 63-64\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                           -3-\n\f          At the hearing the immigration judge (\"IJ\") asked Waweru\n\nwhy, \"[c]onsidering that Moi is no longer in power, the KANU party\n\nis no longer in power,\" he \"would . . . be afraid to go back to\n\nKenya now?\"   Waweru responded:\n\n                 One reason is because as--since there\n          was a new president, I've spoken--you know,\n          called people back home. . . . I've spoken to\n          them about . . . is there any changes now that\n          we have a new president? They say that he's\n          been--according to what he's telling people,\n          he's out for good. He is out to bring change,\n          but the things that--you know, that were\n          happening before is still happening. People\n          are getting killed. People are getting killed\n          for no reason.\n\n          When pressed by the IJ as to why the new government of\n\nKenya would want to harm him, Waweru responded that he \"believe[s]\n\nthere are members of the police and the security called KANU youth-\n\nwingers who are still there now,\" and they knew he left and would\n\nwant to hurt him again.   He explained that this was so because he\n\n          would be active . . . in the politics again. .\n          . . I would get into their hands whatever part\n          of the country I would be in, and if something\n          came to be known--well, one reason would be\n          that if I got arrested, it would be for the\n          reasons of being against the government.2\n\n          Thereafter the IJ ruled that Waweru had adequately shown\n\npast persecution based on his political opinions, which gives rise\n\n\n\n     2\n      The IJ asked Waweru why he would remain in opposition \"if .\n. . the opposition took power.\"     Waweru responded that he was\n\"always going to be on the side of human rights and the proper\ngovernment, democracy, and funds going to where they're supposed to\nbe going, schools and all that, and not being used by leaders.\"\n\n                                  -4-\n\fto a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution.              8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).        Such a presumption, unless rebutted,\n\nestablishes eligibility for asylum, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A)\n\n(2000); but rebuttal may be based on a showing that \"[t]here has\n\nbeen a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant\n\nno longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in [his] country\n\nof nationality.\"    8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A).\n\n          In this instance, the IJ found that \"the prior basis of\n\n[Waweru's] claim was the government of President Moi which is no\n\nlonger in power.     The Court simply finds that [Waweru] no longer\n\nhas a well-founded fear of persecution on account of his political\n\nopinion . . . .\"    The IJ also found that Waweru did not qualify for\n\nhumanitarian    asylum,   8    C.F.R.       §   208.13(b)(1)(iii)(A),     for\n\nwithholding    of   removal   under    former     section   143(h)   of   the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"),3 or for withholding of\n\nremoval under the United Nations Convention Against Torture.              See\n\nForeign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. L. No.\n\n105-277, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-821; see also 8 C.F.R. §\n\n208.16(c).\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      INA section 143(h), formerly codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1253(h),\nwas repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\nResponsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. L. No. 104-208, § 307,\n110 Stat. 3009, 3009-613 to 3009-614, but under IIRIRA transitional\nrules, its repeal does not apply to proceedings (such as Waweru's)\nbegun before IIRIRA's April 1, 1997, effective date. Id. § 309(c),\n110 Stat. 3009, 3009-625 to 3009-626.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f          Waweru appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(\"BIA\"), arguing inter alia that the IJ's decision failed to link\n\nchanged conditions in Kenya to his situation.              The BIA summarily\n\naffirmed based on the IJ's decision and, accordingly, it is the\n\nIJ's decision that we review.       Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).       We review findings of fact \"under a deferential\n\n'substantial evidence standard,'\"         Alvarez-Flores v. INS, 909 F.2d\n\n1, 3 (1st Cir. 1990), and defer to the BIA's (or, here, the IJ's)\n\nreasonable inferences in evaluating evidence, Martinez v. INS, 970\n\nF.2d 973, 975 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          The main issue in this case is simply stated but less\n\neasily resolved: it is whether the IJ rationally concluded that the\n\ngovernment, relying on evidence of changed country conditions, had\n\nrebutted the presumption that Waweru retained a \"well-founded\" fear\n\nof future persecution. Cases turning on changed country conditions\n\nare not uncommon, and the cases contain a certain amount of\n\npertinent general language;4 but very little of it helps decide\n\nconcrete cases like this one which tend to turn on reasoning about\n\nspecific facts.\n\n          Some    of    our   decisions   suggest   that    changed   country\n\nconditions cannot suffice without a more particularized showing,\n\n\n\n     4\n      See, e.g., Hernandez-Barrera v. Ashcroft, 373 F.3d 9, 24-25\n(1st Cir. 2004); Quevedo v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 39, 44-45 (1st Cir.\n2003); Yatskin v. INS, 255 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2001); Fergiste v.\nINS, 138 F.3d 14, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                    -6-\n\fsee, e.g., Hernandez-Barrera v. Ashcroft, 373 F.3d 9, 24-25 (1st\n\nCir. 2005), and some suggest the contrary, see, e.g., Quevedo v.\n\nAshcroft, 336 F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir. 2003); but the reconciling (and\n\nmost accurate) proposition is that changed country conditions \"do\n\nnot   automatically   trump\"   the     applicant's    specific     evidence.\n\nFergiste v. INS, 138 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 1998) (emphasis added);\n\nsee also Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales, 428 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   The surrender of the British at Yorktown in 1781 did not\n\nnegate the potential threat to Tories; it probably did as to the\n\nPatriots.\n\n            Here, one might think it plain that Waweru's fear of\n\npersecution at the hands of the Moi regime, on account of his\n\npolitical opposition to it, would cease to be reasonable once Moi\n\nhad been defeated and replaced by a democratic government.                But\n\nWaweru   offers   three   counters:    that   some   of   Moi's   own   former\n\nfollowers are part of the successful anti-Moi coalition; that many\n\nlower level functionaries (e.g., individual policemen) are still in\n\ntheir original roles and behaving brutally; and that he (Waweru)\n\nwill oppose this government, too.\n\n            The question, then, is whether the IJ rationally found\n\nsuch arguments unpersuasive in concluding that the change of regime\n\ndid overcome Waweru's once well-founded fear. True, the IJ did not\n\nseparate the strands and discuss them individually; but it is\n\nenough if we can perceive from the evidence and the arguments how\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fhis mind would naturally have run.           See Rodriguez-Rodriguez v.\n\nOrtiz-Velez, 391 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir. 2004); Tang v. State of\n\nR.I., Dep't of Elderly Affairs, 120 F.3d 325, 326 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nIn this case, it is easy enough to discern the line of reasoning.\n\n            The victorious anti-Moi coalition plainly included former\n\nMoi followers.     One of its components is a break-away faction of\n\nKANU itself.      But the coalition opposed and defeated Moi's hand-\n\npicked successor supported by the main KANU party. The IJ could\n\nreasonably reject, as weak and unsupported, an inference that the\n\npresent government is dominated or heavily influenced by those whom\n\nWaweru once opposed.       In addition, news reports relied on by the\n\ngovernment (and submitted to the IJ by Waweru prior to his final\n\nhearing below) suggest that the new regime is genuinely opposed to\n\nMoi's style of governance--as does Waweru's own testimony at his\n\nfinal hearing.\n\n            The   second   argument    in   Waweru's   favor   is   somewhat\n\nstronger.    It is possible, perhaps likely, that many of those who\n\nserved in the police in the Moi years are still in their accustomed\n\nroles.   It is also quite plausible, as Waweru specifically claimed\n\nin the final hearing, that police brutality and corruption remain\n\nhigh; it takes a long time to alter attitudes ingrained over a\n\nperiod of despotism, especially in circumstances of poverty that\n\nafflict much of the world.       Waweru, like others in his country,\n\ndoubtless faces very real risks.\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f            Lacking, however, is any reason to think that Waweru is\n\nat risk--even from these same officers who earlier arrested and\n\nbeat him--because of Waweru's opposition to the Moi regime.                 Even\n\nif certain officers still prefer Moi's one-party state, their\n\ncentral motive for hostility to Waweru was his active opposition to\n\nthe Moi government.       That government is gone; so, one would think,\n\nis the motive.        The IJ was not rationally obliged to accept\n\nWaweru's    inference     that   the   threat     of    political   persecution\n\ncontinued.\n\n            This brings us finally to Waweru's claim that he would\n\noppose the new government.         We will assume arguendo that Waweru\n\ncould make out a claim of persecution even if he chose deliberately\n\nto   put   himself   in   harm's   way;      sometimes    this   view   might   be\n\njustified, sometimes not. Nor is his position necessarily captious\n\nor unworthy of being credited: we take it from context that he may\n\nregard the new government, even if better motivated than Moi's, as\n\none that still falls far short of Waweru's expectations.\n\n            Still, the new government took power by beating Moi at\n\nthe polls; according to the news reports, it professes democratic\n\nideals and promises reforms.              The notion that it would treat\n\nWaweru's renewed peaceful opposition with the repressive brutality\n\nof the Moi regime is not compelling, or at least not an inference\n\nso strong that the IJ had to accept it.                See Yatskin v. INS, 255\n\nF.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2001); see also In re N-M-A-, 22 I. & N. Dec.\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f312, 320-21 (B.I.A. 1998) (asylum applicant persecuted by prior\n\nregime cannot retain presumption of well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution after regime change unless the new leaders \"harbor the\n\nsame animosities as the old\").\n\n          As for Waweru's other claims of error, the first sought\n\nreversal of the BIA's rejection of his request for withholding of\n\nremoval under the INA.         A request for asylum and a request for\n\nwithholding    of   removal    require   petitioners   to   meet   different\n\nevidentiary burdens: withholding of removal requires a petitioner\n\nto prove \"a clear probability of persecution\" upon removal to the\n\ncountry in question, as contrasted with the less burdensome \"well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution\" requirement for asylum eligibility.\n\nAguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 n.3 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          But whereas proof of a well-founded fear of persecution\n\nmerely earns a petitioner eligibility for asylum, leaving the\n\nultimate decision to the Attorney General's discretion, Romilus v.\n\nAshcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004), a petitioner who meets the\n\nrequirements    for   the     (since-repealed)   withholding   of   removal\n\nprovision of the INA generally cannot (with very few exceptions) be\n\nremoved to the country at issue.         INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S.\n\n415, 419 (1999); Romilus, 385 F.3d at 8.          In any event, since we\n\nuphold in this case the IJ's ruling that Waweru has not established\n\na well-founded fear of future persecution in Kenya, he certainly\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fcannot show a \"clear probability of persecution\" if he is returned\n\nto Kenya.    See id.; Hernandez-Barrera, 373 F.3d at 26 n.14.\n\n            Waweru also sought protection under the U.N. Convention\n\nAgainst   Torture.      Under   the   Convention,   a   showing   that   a\n\npetitioner, if deported, will \"more likely than not\" be tortured by\n\nor with the consent or acquiescence of a public official gives a\n\npetitioner mandatory protection from removal to the country in\n\nquestion.     Elien v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2); In re J-E-, 23 I. & N. Dec. 291,\n\n297 (BIA 2002)).     The petitioner need not prove that the probable\n\ntorture will be motivated by one of the limited classes of reasons\n\napplicable to asylum and withholding of removal claims.\n\n            In this case, even if we were to assume that Waweru's\n\nearlier beatings by the police amounted to torture under the\n\nConvention's definition--a proposition that is far from clear--we\n\ncannot say that the IJ's decision lacked \"substantial evidence\" to\n\nsupport it.    Alvarez-Flores, 909 F.2d 3.    As we stated above, the\n\nIJ was not compelled on the evidence submitted to accept the\n\ninference that Waweru would be targeted for persecution (torture or\n\notherwise) upon return, since the only apparent motive for such\n\npersecution (at the hands of police or the Moi government) no\n\nlonger exists.\n\n            Finally, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in rejecting\n\nWaweru's request for humanitarian asylum; this is granted only in\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fcases of \"extraordinary suffering,\" Zarouite v. Gonzales, 424 F.3d\n\n60, 64 (1st Cir. 2005), and the arbitrary arrests and beatings\n\nalleged by Waweru do not rise to this level.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                              -12-\n\f",

Waweru conceded deportability but sought asylum and withholding of removal on the grounds that he had previously suffered persecution in Kenya because of his political beliefs and reasonably feared future persecution should he return. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13 (2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons not fully explained, the proceedings dragged on through a series of hearings from 1997 to 2000, followed by another delay in 2002 for Waweru to obtain new counsel. For the final hearing, held in September 2003, a new immigration judge replaced the original immigration judge who had presided at the earlier proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Kenya gained its independence in December 1963, a <i>de facto</i> (and later <i>de jure</i>) one-party state was established under the first president, Jomo Kenyatta, and continued under his successor, Daniel arap Moi. After a change to the constitution in 1991, multi-party elections were held in 1992 and 1997, but Moi won reelection both times and his party, the Kenya African National Union (\"KANU\"), remained dominant. Waweru testified that his mother was active in an opposition party, the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (\"FORD\"), and convinced him to join in 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Waweru testified that after he began to take an active part in FORD, he was subjected to threats, intimidation and&#8212;in 1991 and 1992&#8212;multiple arrests and beatings because of his opposition to Moi. Waweru says that his mother was also accosted and beaten by police and by youth gangs loyal to the KANU party. After Waweru's last arrest in May 1992, he secured a U.S. student visa and left the country for the United States in September. That same year FORD split into two factions: FORD-Kenya and FORD-Asili (to which Waweru and his family adhered).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2001, Moi said he would not run again (his term was scheduled to end in 2003) and thereafter a number of opposition parties formed an alliance, the National Rainbow Coalition (\"NARC\"), to challenge KANU and its candidate for president. The alliance included, according to Waweru, the FORD-Kenya party and a break-away faction of KANU. In December 2002, the NARC's candidate defeated Moi's designated successor and the new regime took over the government. Waweru's final hearing, in September 2003, understandably focused upon the recent political changes in Kenya, acknowledged in the U.S. State Department's country report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing the immigration judge (\"IJ\") asked Waweru why, \"[c]onsidering that Moi is no longer in power, the KANU party is no longer in power,\" he \"would... be afraid to go back to Kenya now?\" Waweru responded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One reason is because as&#8212;since there was a new president, I've spoken&#8212;you know, called people back home.... I've spoken to them about ... is there any changes now that we have a new president? They say that he's been&#8212;according to what he's telling people, he's out for good. He is out to bring change, but the things that &#8212; you know, that were happening before is still happening. People are getting killed. People are getting killed for no reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When pressed by the IJ as to why the <i>new</i> government of Kenya would want to harm him, Waweru responded that he \"believe[s] there are members of the police and the security called KANU youth-wingers who are still there now,\" and they knew he left and would want to hurt him again. He explained that this was so because he</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">would be active ... in the politics again.... I would get into their hands whatever part of the country I would be in, and if something came to be known&#8212; well, one reason would be that if I got arrested, it would be for the reasons of being against the government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter the IJ ruled that Waweru had adequately shown past persecution based on his political opinions, which gives rise to a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b)(1). Such a presumption, unless rebutted, establishes eligibility for asylum, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000); but rebuttal may be based on a showing that \"[t]here has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in [his] country of nationality.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the IJ found that \"the prior basis of [Waweru's] claim was the government of President Moi which is no longer in power. The Court simply finds that [Waweru] no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of his political opinion....\" The IJ also found that Waweru did not qualify for humanitarian asylum, 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b)(1)(iii)(A), for withholding of removal under former section 143(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> or for withholding of removal under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. <i>See</i> Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub.L. No. 105-277, &#167; 2242, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-821; <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.16(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Waweru appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), arguing <i>inter alia</i> that the IJ's decision failed to link changed conditions in Kenya to his situation. The BIA summarily affirmed based on the IJ's decision and, accordingly, it is the IJ's decision that we review. <i>Albathani v. INS,</i> 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir.2003). We review findings of fact \"under a deferential `substantial evidence standard,'\" <i>Alvarez-Flores v. INS,</i> 909 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1990), and defer to the BIA's (or, here, the IJ's) reasonable inferences in evaluating evidence, <i>Martinez v. INS,</i> 970 F.2d 973, 975 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main issue in this case is simply stated but less easily resolved: it is whether the IJ rationally concluded that the government, relying on evidence of changed country conditions, had rebutted the presumption that Waweru retained a \"well-founded\" fear of future persecution. Cases turning on changed country conditions are not uncommon, and the cases contain a certain amount of pertinent general language;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> but very little of it helps decide concrete cases like this one which tend to turn on reasoning about specific facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some of our decisions suggest that changed country conditions cannot suffice without a more particularized showing, <i>see, e.g., Hernandez-Barrera v. Ashcroft,</i> 373 F.3d 9, 24-25 (1st Cir.2005), and some suggest the contrary, <i>see, e.g., Quevedo v. Ashcroft,</i> 336 F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir.2003); but the reconciling (and most accurate) proposition is that changed country conditions \"do not <i>automatically</i> trump\" the applicant's specific evidence. <i>Fergiste v. INS,</i> 138 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir.1998) (emphasis added); <i>see also Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales,</i> 428 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir. 2005). The surrender of the British at Yorktown in 1781 did not negate the potential threat to Tories; it probably did as to the Patriots.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, one might think it plain that Waweru's fear of persecution at the hands of the Moi regime, on account of his political opposition to it, would cease to be reasonable once Moi had been defeated and replaced by a democratic government. But Waweru offers three counters: that some of Moi's own former followers are part of the successful anti-Moi coalition; that many lower level functionaries (<i>e.g.,</i> individual policemen) are still in their original roles and behaving brutally; and that he (Waweru) will oppose this government, too.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question, then, is whether the IJ rationally found such arguments unpersuasive in concluding that the change of regime did overcome Waweru's once well-founded fear. True, the IJ did not separate the strands and discuss them individually; but it is enough if we can perceive from the evidence and the arguments how his mind would naturally have run. <i>See Rodriguez-Rodriguez v. Ortiz-Velez,</i> 391 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Tang v. State of R.I., Dep't of Elderly Affairs,</i> 120 F.3d 325, 326 (1st Cir.1997). In this case, it is easy enough to discern the line of reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The victorious anti-Moi coalition plainly included former Moi followers. One of its components is a break-away faction of KANU itself. But the coalition <i>opposed and defeated</i> Moi's hand-picked successor supported by the main KANU party. The IJ could reasonably reject, as weak and unsupported, an inference that the present government is dominated or heavily influenced by those whom Waweru once opposed. In addition, news reports relied on by the government (and submitted to the IJ by Waweru prior to his final hearing below) suggest that the new regime is genuinely opposed to Moi's style of governance&#8212;as does Waweru's own testimony at his final hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second argument in Waweru's favor is somewhat stronger. It is possible, perhaps likely, that many of those who served in the police in the Moi years are still in their accustomed roles. It is also quite plausible, as Waweru specifically claimed in the final hearing, that police brutality and corruption remain high; it takes a long time to alter attitudes ingrained over a period of despotism, especially in circumstances of poverty that afflict much of the world. Waweru, like others in his country, doubtless faces very real risks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lacking, however, is any reason to think that Waweru is at risk&#8212;even from these same officers who earlier arrested and beat him&#8212;<i>because of</i> Waweru's opposition to the Moi regime. Even if certain officers still prefer Moi's one-party state, their central motive for hostility to Waweru was his active opposition to the Moi government. That government is gone; so, one would think, is the motive. The IJ was not rationally obliged to accept Waweru's inference that the threat of <i>political</i> persecution continued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us finally to Waweru's claim that he would oppose the new government. We will assume <i>arguendo</i> that Waweru could make out a claim of persecution even if he chose deliberately to put himself in harm's way; sometimes this view might be justified, sometimes not. Nor is his position necessarily captious or unworthy of being credited: we take it from context that he may regard the new government, even if better motivated than Moi's, as one that still falls far short of Waweru's expectations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, the new government took power by beating Moi at the polls; according to the news reports, it professes democratic ideals and promises reforms. The notion that it would treat Waweru's renewed peaceful opposition with the repressive brutality of the Moi regime is not compelling, or at least not an inference so strong that the IJ had to accept it. <i>See Yatskin v. INS,</i> 255 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir.2001); <i>see also In re N-M-A-,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 312, 320-21 (B.I.A. 1998) (asylum applicant persecuted by prior regime cannot retain presumption of well-founded fear of future persecution after regime change unless the new leaders \"harbor the same animosities as the old\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Waweru's other claims of error, the first sought reversal of the BIA's rejection of his request for withholding of removal under the INA. A request for asylum and a request for withholding of removal require petitioners to meet different evidentiary burdens: withholding of removal requires a petitioner to prove \"a clear probability of persecution\" upon removal to the country in question, as contrasted with the less burdensome \"well-founded fear of persecution\" requirement for asylum eligibility. <i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 569 n. 3 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But whereas proof of a well-founded fear of persecution merely earns a petitioner eligibility for asylum, leaving the ultimate decision to the Attorney General's discretion, <i>Romilus v. Ashcroft,</i> 385 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2004), a petitioner who meets the requirements for the (since-repealed) withholding of removal provision of the INA generally cannot (with very few exceptions) be removed to the country at issue. <i>INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> 526 U.S. 415, 419, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999); <i>Romilus,</i> 385 F.3d at 8. In any event, since we uphold in this case the IJ's ruling that Waweru has not established a well-founded fear of future persecution in Kenya, he certainly cannot show a \"clear probability of persecution\" if he is returned to Kenya. <i>See id.; Hernandez-Barrera,</i> 373 F.3d at 26 n. 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Waweru also sought protection under the U.N. Convention Against Torture. Under the Convention, a showing that a petitioner, if deported, will \"more likely than not\" be tortured by or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official gives a petitioner mandatory protection from removal to the country in question. <i>Elien v. Ashcroft,</i> 364 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir.2004) (citing 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.16(c)(2); <i>In re J-E-,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 291, 297 (BIA 2002)). The petitioner need not prove that the probable torture will be motivated by one of the limited classes of reasons applicable to asylum and withholding of removal claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, even if we were to assume that Waweru's earlier beatings by the police amounted to torture under the Convention's definition&#8212;a proposition that is far from clear&#8212;we cannot say that the IJ's decision lacked \"substantial evidence\" to support it. <i>Alvarez-Flores,</i> 909 F.2d at 3. As we stated above, the IJ was not compelled on the evidence submitted to accept the inference that Waweru would be targeted for persecution (torture or otherwise) upon return, since the only apparent motive for such persecution (at the hands of police or the Moi government) no longer exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in rejecting Waweru's request for humanitarian asylum; this is granted only in cases of \"extraordinary suffering,\" <i>Zarouite v. Gonzales,</i> 424 F.3d 60, 64 (1st Cir.2005), and the arbitrary arrests and beatings alleged by Waweru do not rise to this level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Board of Immigration Appeals is entitled to rely on the State Department's country reports as proof of country conditions described therein, although it must also consider evidence in the record that contradicts the State Department's descriptions and conclusions<i>See, e.g., Zarouite v.

In December 2002, the NARC's candidate defeated Moi's designated successor and the new regime took over the government.

Such a presumption, unless rebutted, establishes eligibility for asylum, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000); but rebuttal may be based on a showing that \"[t]here has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in [his] country of nationality.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the IJ found that \"the prior basis of [Waweru's] claim was the government of President Moi which is no longer in power. The Court simply finds that [Waweru] no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of his political opinion....\" The IJ also found that Waweru did not qualify for humanitarian asylum, 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b)(1)(iii)(A), for withholding of removal under former section 143(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> or for withholding of removal under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. <i>See</i> Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub.L.

The BIA summarily affirmed based on the IJ's decision and, accordingly, it is the IJ's decision that we review. <i>Albathani v.

INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587571\"><a href=\"/opinion/587571/javier-a-martinez-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">973</span></a></span>, 975 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main issue in this case is simply stated but less easily resolved: it is whether the IJ rationally concluded that the government, relying on evidence of changed country conditions, had rebutted the presumption that Waweru retained a \"well-founded\" fear of future persecution. Cases turning on changed country conditions are not uncommon, and the cases contain a certain amount of pertinent general language;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> but very little of it helps decide concrete cases like this one which tend to turn on reasoning about specific facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some of our decisions suggest that changed country conditions cannot suffice without a more particularized showing, <i>see, e.g., Hernandez-Barrera v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786695\"><a href=\"/opinion/786695/fidel-angel-hernandez-barrera-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 24-25 (1st Cir.2005), and some suggest the contrary, <i>see, e.g., Quevedo v.

INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197837\"><a href=\"/opinion/197837/fergiste-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1998) (emphasis added); <i>see also Palma-Mazariegos v.

The surrender of the British at Yorktown in 1781 did not negate the potential threat to Tories; it probably did as to the Patriots.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, one might think it plain that Waweru's fear of persecution at the hands of the Moi regime, on account of his political opposition to it, would cease to be reasonable once Moi had been defeated and replaced by a democratic government. But Waweru offers three counters: that some of Moi's own former followers are part of the successful anti-Moi coalition; that many lower level functionaries (<i>e.g.,</i> individual policemen) are still in their original roles and behaving brutally; and that he (Waweru) will oppose this government, too.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question, then, is whether the IJ rationally found such arguments unpersuasive in concluding that the change of regime did overcome Waweru's once well-founded fear. True, the IJ did not separate the strands and discuss them individually; but it is enough if we can perceive from the evidence and the arguments how his mind would naturally have run. <i>See Rodriguez-Rodriguez v. Ortiz-Velez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201368\"><a href=\"/opinion/201368/rodriguez-rodriguez-v-ortiz-velez/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Tang v. State of R.I., Dep't of Elderly Affairs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744482\"><a href=\"/opinion/744482/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1086-71-empl-prac-dec-p-44944-rhoda-tang/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>, 326 (1st Cir.1997). In this case, it is easy enough to discern the line of reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The victorious anti-Moi coalition plainly included former Moi followers. One of its components is a break-away faction of KANU itself. But the coalition <i>opposed and defeated</i> Moi's hand-picked successor supported by the main KANU party. The IJ could reasonably reject, as weak and unsupported, an inference that the present government is dominated or heavily influenced by those whom Waweru once opposed. In addition, news reports relied on by the government (and submitted to the IJ by Waweru prior to his final hearing below) suggest that the new regime is genuinely opposed to Moi's style of governance&#8212;as does Waweru's own testimony at his final hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second argument in Waweru's favor is somewhat stronger. It is possible, perhaps likely, that many of those who served in the police in the Moi years are still in their accustomed roles. It is also quite plausible, as Waweru specifically claimed in the final hearing, that police brutality and corruption remain high; it takes a long time to alter attitudes ingrained over a period of despotism, especially in circumstances of poverty that afflict much of the world. Waweru, like others in his country, doubtless faces very real risks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lacking, however, is any reason to think that Waweru is at risk&#8212;even from these same officers who earlier arrested and beat him&#8212;<i>because of</i> Waweru's opposition to the Moi regime. Even if certain officers still prefer Moi's one-party state, their central motive for hostility to Waweru was his active opposition to the Moi government. That government is gone; so, one would think, is the motive. The IJ was not rationally obliged to accept Waweru's inference that the threat of <i>political</i> persecution continued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us finally to Waweru's claim that he would oppose the new government. We will assume <i>arguendo</i> that Waweru could make out a claim of persecution even if he chose deliberately to put himself in harm's way; sometimes this view might be justified, sometimes not. Nor is his position necessarily captious or unworthy of being credited: we take it from context that he may regard the new government, even if better motivated than Moi's, as one that still falls far short of Waweru's expectations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, the new government took power by beating Moi at the polls; according to the news reports, it professes democratic ideals and promises reforms. The notion that it would treat Waweru's renewed peaceful opposition with the repressive brutality of the Moi regime is not compelling, or at least not an inference so strong that the IJ had to accept it. <i>See Yatskin v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199481\"><a href=\"/opinion/199481/yatskin-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.2001); <i>see also In re N-M-A-,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 312, 320-21 (B.I.A. 1998) (asylum applicant persecuted by prior regime cannot retain presumption of well-founded fear of future persecution after regime change unless the new leaders \"harbor the same animosities as the old\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Waweru's other claims of error, the first sought reversal of the BIA's rejection of his request for withholding of removal under the INA. A request for asylum and a request for withholding of removal require petitioners to meet different evidentiary burdens: withholding of removal requires a petitioner to prove \"a clear probability of persecution\" upon removal to the country in question, as contrasted with the less burdensome \"well-founded fear of persecution\" requirement for asylum eligibility. <i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span>, 569 n. 3 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But whereas proof of a well-founded fear of persecution merely earns a petitioner eligibility for asylum, leaving the ultimate decision to the Attorney General's discretion, <i>Romilus v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span> (1999); <i>Romilus,</i> 385 F.3d at 8. In any event, since we uphold in this case the IJ's ruling that Waweru has not established a well-founded fear of future persecution in Kenya, he certainly cannot show a \"clear probability of persecution\" if he is returned to Kenya. <i>See id.; Hernandez-Barrera,</i> 373 F.3d at 26 n. 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Waweru also sought protection under the U.N. Convention Against Torture. Under the Convention, a showing that a petitioner, if deported, will \"more likely than not\" be tortured by or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official gives a petitioner mandatory protection from removal to the country in question. <i>Elien v.

As we stated above, the IJ was not compelled on the evidence submitted to accept the inference that Waweru would be targeted for persecution (torture or otherwise) upon return, since the only apparent motive for such persecution (at the hands of police or the Moi government) no longer exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in rejecting Waweru's request for humanitarian asylum; this is granted only in cases of \"extraordinary suffering,\" <i>Zarouite v.
