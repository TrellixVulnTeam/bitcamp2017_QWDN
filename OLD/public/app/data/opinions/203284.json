Bernal, Assistant Director, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, LaTia N. Bing, U.S. Department of Justice, and Anthony\nC. Payne, Senior Litigation Counsel with Office of Immigration\nLitigation, U.S. Department of Justice, were on brief for\nRespondent.\n\n      Wei Jia was on brief for Petitioner.\n\n\n                                May 8, 2008\n\n\n\n\n      *\n       Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f     MERRITT, Senior Circuit Judge.             Petitioner Lifei Lin, a\n\ncitizen of the People’s Republic of China, applied for asylum,\n\nrelief from withholding of removal and relief under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture on the ground that he had been arrested and\n\nmistreated by Chinese authorities due to violations of Chinese\n\nfamily planning laws. Lin seeks review of the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals’ July 25, 2007, decision dismissing his appeal from an\n\nimmigration judge’s March 20, 2006, decision, which denied his\n\napplication for asylum and withholding of removal.1             This Court’s\n\njurisdiction      is governed by section 242 of the Immigration and\n\nNationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, as amended by the REAL ID Act of\n\n2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 231, which provides for\n\nreview of final orders of removal.        Lin contends that the adverse\n\ncredibility findings of the immigration judge and upheld by the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals are not supported by substantial\n\nevidence.    Lin also contends that the Board impermissibly engaged\n\nin its own fact finding and that he was deprived of his due process\n\nrights when the immigration judge failed to explicitly state in the\n\ndecision    her   reliance   on   the   REAL   ID   Act   in   assessing   his\n\ncredibility under a “totality of the circumstances” standard.              For\n\nthe following reasons we deny the petition.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n     The immigration judge also denied Lin’s request for protection\npursuant to the Convention Against Terror, but Lin did not appeal\nthat part of the decision.\n\n                                    -2-\n\f                                    I.\n\n      Mr. Lin was born in Fuzhou City, China, on March 7, 1983.            He\n\n“married” on September 10, 2002, with a celebration among family\n\nand   friends,   but   Lin   acknowledges   that   the   marriage   was   not\n\nofficial because both the bride and groom were underage under\n\nChinese law.     A child was born to the union on November 17, 2003.\n\nLin’s “wife” and son remain in China.              Upon learning of the\n\npregnancy and the underage marriage, the authorities arrested Lin.\n\nLin claims he was detained by authorities when he refused to\n\ndisclose the whereabouts of his girlfriend for fear she would be\n\nforced to abort and because he was unable to pay the fine.                Lin\n\nleft China in 2003 because he feared future persecution based on\n\nhis failure to follow China’s family planning laws by marrying\n\nunderage and by having a child without permission, as well as his\n\nfailure to pay a fine imposed due to the violations.\n\n      After leaving his home, Lin went into hiding – first in China,\n\nthen in Holland and Peru.      He eventually made his way to the United\n\nStates and arrived at Miami International Airport on February 6,\n\n2005.   Lin had no valid travel documents or other papers and paid\n\n$7,000 or $8,000 for a smuggler to get him into the United States.\n\nHe requested political asylum and said he left China because he was\n\n“afraid of being punished for impregnating [his] girlfriend.”             Lin\n\nfears that he would be persecuted if he returned to China for\n\nviolations of the family planning laws.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f                                 II.\n\n     To qualify for asylum, an alien needs to demonstrate that he\n\nis a refugee due to previous persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership\n\nin a particular social group, or political opinion.           8 U.S.C. §\n\n1158(b)(1);   Berrio-Barrera v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 163, 167 (1st\n\nCir. 2006). With regard to a fear of future persecution, the\n\napplicant must demonstrate an objectively well-founded fear of\n\npersecution on a protected ground and that this fear is genuine.\n\nAguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999) (proving\n\nthe objective and subjective components of a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution requires the petitioner to show her fear is\n\n“both   genuine   and   objectively    reasonable”).   Fear   of   forced\n\nabortion or sterilization is categorized as fear of persecution on\n\naccount of political opinion.         8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42) (“A person\n\nwho has a well-founded fear that he or she will be forced to\n\nundergo [a forced abortion or sterilization] procedure or [is]\n\nsubject to persecution for failure, refusal, or resistance [to\n\nundergoing such a procedure] shall be deemed to have a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution on account of political opinion.”); Zheng v.\n\nGonzales, 475 F.3d 30, 34 (1st Cir. 2007).      In addition, the spouse\n\nof a person forced to undergo sterilization or abortion procedures\n\nmay be deemed to have a well-founded fear of persecution.          Lin v.\n\nAshcroft, 371 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir. 2004).       Lin claims persecution\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fas the result of the Chinese government’s efforts to enforce its\n\ncoerced population control policies, including the possibility of\n\nforced sterilization for him or his girlfriend should he return to\n\nChina.\n\n     Lin’s applications were denied because the immigration judge\n\nfound that he lacked credibility, primarily due to inconsistencies\n\namong his testimony at the hearing, his asylum application and\n\nstatements made during two interviews held shortly after he entered\n\nthe country.    See Oral Decision of the Immigration Judge at 9-11.\n\nThe immigration judge set out numerous discrepancies in detail in\n\nher decision.   Based on these discrepancies, the immigration judge\n\ndiscredited the majority of Lin’s claimed fear of persecution and\n\ntorture should he return to China.\n\n     For example, the immigration      judge found a discrepancy as to\n\nwhen Lin’s girlfriend’s pregnancy was reported to the authorities.\n\nLin testified at his hearing that his “wife” had been pregnant for\n\nlittle over a month when the authorities found out, but notes taken\n\nduring an earlier credible fear interview suggest that she was five\n\nmonths pregnant. The immigration judge also found a discrepancy as\n\nto the reasons given by Lin for his detention by the authorities.\n\nLin did not mention during his credible-fear interview any concern\n\nabout his girlfriend being forced to have an abortion or fear that\n\neither or both of them would be forcibly sterilized at a later\n\ndate.    The only fear Lin expressed at that time about returning to\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fChina concerned the punishment he might face for his failure to pay\n\nthe   fine.     Later,   however,   during     direct   examination        at   the\n\nhearing, Lin expressed a fear of forced sterilization should he\n\nreturn to China.      He also testified that he fled China because he\n\nfeared further beatings based on the beating he says he received by\n\nChinese authorities when he refused to divulge the whereabouts of\n\nhis girlfriend for fear she would be forced to have an abortion.\n\nAlso noted by the immigration judge was a discrepancy about the\n\nduration of detention:      Lin reported the detention as lasting two\n\ndays during the asylum interview but said it was four days on\n\ndirect examination during his hearing before the immigration judge.\n\nLin also reported being beaten with an electric baton in his asylum\n\ninterview, but did not mention until his hearing that he had been\n\ninjured and hospitalized due to the beating.\n\n      The immigration judge also noted the unexplained discrepancy\n\nin why Lin originally claimed to have been arrested on January 5,\n\n2003, but then later testified that he was actually arrested on\n\nMarch   30,   2003.      Similarly,    the    immigration      judge   noted      a\n\ndiscrepancy between Lin’s application for asylum and his asylum\n\ninterview concerning the date he left China.                June 20, 2004, was\n\nthe date given at the asylum interview, but October 20 2003, is the\n\ndate Lin gave in his asylum application.             Lin has also submitted\n\ncontradictory    evidence    regarding       the   events    that   took    place\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fsubsequent to his arrest in China and prior to his arrival in the\n\nUnited States.\n\n     Based on these multiple discrepancies, the immigration judge\n\nfound that Lin had failed to meet his burden of proof with regard\n\nto his asylum application.      Because Lin failed to meet the burden\n\nof proof for asylum, he was also unable to meet the more stringent\n\nstandard    for   withholding   of   removal.      Rodriguez-Ramirez     v.\n\nAshcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2005) (finding that because\n\nthe burden of proof necessary to establish an asylum claim is lower\n\nthan the burden of proof required to prevail on a withholding of\n\nremoval claim, “the BIA’s rejection of the petitioner's asylum\n\nclaim, if sustainable, sounds the death knell for his counterpart\n\nclaim for withholding of removal”).\n\n     Lin appealed the denial of his applications to the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals, which affirmed on the ground that the adverse\n\ncredibility finding was not clearly erroneous.           The Board decision\n\nfocused primarily on the discrepancies concerning various dates,\n\nsuch as when Lin left China, when he was arrested, and the date on\n\nwhich his girlfriend’s pregnancy was discovered by the authorities\n\nas well as the circumstances surrounding the disclosure of the\n\npregnancy    to   the   authorities.       The   Board    also   noted   the\n\ninconsistencies in Lin’s statements concerning the events that took\n\nplace after he was arrested and his activities and whereabouts\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fprior to entering the United States.                    Decision of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals, July 25, 2007.\n\n      Lin petitions this Court for review of the Board’s decision.\n\nHe contends that the adverse credibility finding was not supported\n\nby substantial evidence.            We review the Board’s findings of fact\n\nunder a substantial evidence standard, under which the agency’s\n\nfindings are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be\n\ncompelled to conclude to the contrary. We review the entire record\n\nto   assess      whether    the    findings      are    supported   by    substantial\n\nevidence.      Where the Board adopts the immigration judge’s ruling,\n\nbut also engages in discussion of its own, as here, we review both\n\ndecisions.       Hem v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 67, 69 (1st Cir. 2008).                Under\n\nthe deferential substantial evidence standard, we consider whether\n\nthe agency’s ruling is supported by “reasonable, substantial and\n\nprobative evidence on the record as a whole.”                        INS v. Elias-\n\nZacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992).                    Upon review of the entire\n\nrecord, we hold that substantial evidence supports the findings of\n\nthe immigration judge as affirmed by the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals.      The discrepancies are well documented in the immigration\n\njudge’s    decision        and    the   record    does    not    compel   a   contrary\n\nconclusion.\n\n      Lin also contends that the Board violated its scope of review\n\nbecause     it    impermissibly         engaged    in     fact    finding     when   it\n\n“determined that Lin originally claimed to have been arrested on\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fJanuary 5, 2003, but then later testified that the event occurred\n\non March 30, 2003.”     Lin claims the immigration judge made no such\n\nfinding in her decision.      Petitioner’s Br. at 10.    Contrary to\n\nLin’s argument, however, the immigration judge explicitly found a\n\ndiscrepancy when she said “in the asylum interview respondent\n\nasserts he was arrested on January 5, 2003, as opposed to March 30,\n\n2003, according to his direct testimony.”       Oral Decision of the\n\nImmigration Judge at 11.      Accordingly, Lin’s argument concerning\n\nimpermissible fact finding by the Board fails.\n\n     Lin also argues that his due process rights were violated\n\nbecause the immigration judge did not clearly indicate that new\n\namendments to the REAL ID Act2 applied to Lin’s asylum application\n\n\n     2\n         The new language provides:\n\n     Credibility determination. Considering the totality of\n     the circumstances, and all relevant factors, a trier of\n     fact may base a credibility determination on the\n     demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant or\n     witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant’s or\n     witness’s   account,   the   consistency   between   the\n     applicant’s or witness’s written and oral statements\n     (whenever made and whether or not under oath, and\n     considering the circumstances under which the statements\n     were made), the internal consistency of each such\n     statement, the consistency of such statements with other\n     evidence of record (including the reports of the\n     Department of State on country conditions), and any\n     inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without\n     regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or\n     falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant’s claim, or\n     any other relevant factor.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); see also 8 U.S.C. §§ 1231(b)(3)(C)\n&   1229a(c)(4)(C)   (credibility   determination   for   removal\nproceeding).\n\n                                  -9-\n\fand yet the Board, on appeal, explicitly applied the provisions.\n\nThe import of the amendments to the REAL ID Act is to eliminate the\n\n“heart of the claim” rule and instead to rely on a “totality of the\n\ncircumstances” rule in making credibility determinations.      The\n\nchange allows the immigration judge to make credibility findings\n\nbased on all the evidence – not just evidence that goes to the\n\n“heart” of the petitioner’s claims.     See Castañeda-Castillo v.\n\nGonzales, 488 F.3d 17, 23 n.6 (1st Cir. 2007) (en banc) (under Real\n\nID Act “fact-finder is entitled to draw the falsus in omnibus\n\ninference based on inaccuracies, inconsistencies, or falsehoods,\n\nwithout regard to whether they go to the heart of the applicant's\n\nclaim,” although the amendment would not have changed result in\n\ncase at bar) (internal quotation marks and punctuation omitted);\n\nChen v. United States Att'y Gen., 454 F.3d 103, 106-07 n.2 (2d Cir.\n\n2006) (per curiam) (in case in which Real ID Act inapplicable,\n\nstating that new provision would seem to overrule certain Second\n\nCircuit credibility determination rules); Chen v. United States\n\nAtt'y Gen., 463 F.3d 1228, 1233 (11th Cir. 2006) (applying Real ID\n\nAct; rejecting argument that discrepancy was trivial); Jibril v.\n\nGonzales, 423 F.3d 1129, 1138 n.1 (9th Cir. 2005) (opining that if\n\nReal ID Act applied to the case, it would change result dictated by\n\nNinth Circuit's heart of the claim rule); In re J-Y-C-, 24 I. & N.\n\nDec. 260, 265 (BIA 2007) (not necessary under Real ID Act that\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\finconsistencies relied on in credibility determinations go to the\n\nheart of the claim).    But see Kadia v. Gonzales, 501 F.3d 817, 821-\n\n22 (7th Cir. 2007) (in case in which Real ID Act not applicable,\n\nexpressing    skepticism     that   Real    ID    Act    revives   “discredited”\n\ndoctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus).\n\n     Consequently, we may not reverse the Board’s decision on the\n\nground that the inconsistencies it relied on in affirming the\n\nadverse credibility do not go to the “heart” of Lin’s claim.\n\nHowever, the immigration judge found Lin’s testimony not credible\n\nwith regard to several facts that “go to the heart” of Lin’s asylum\n\nclaim.   Oral Decision of the Immigration Judge at 8, Mar. 20, 2006.\n\nTherefore, Lin’s application fails to meet the necessary burden\n\nunder either the new, more-stringent standard of the REAL ID Act\n\namendment that allows the immigration judge to assess credibility\n\nbased on every fact put forth by the applicant in support of his\n\napplication or under the former “heart of the claim” standard that\n\nrequires the immigration judge to look only to those facts central\n\nto the claims in the application.                  Accordingly, even if the\n\nimmigration    judge   did    not   apply        the    new   “totality   of   the\n\ncircumstances” language from the REAL ID Act amendments, and we\n\nhave no reason to believe that she did not,3 Lin suffered no\n\n\n     3\n      The immigration judge is entitled to a presumption of\nregularity in her rulings such that the failure to explicitly\nmention that the REAL ID Act applied to the application does not\nviolate Lin’s due process rights. Enwonwu v. Gonzales, 232 Fed.\nAppx. 11, 15 (1st Cir. May 10, 2007) (no due process violation\n\n                                     -11-\n\fprejudice from the immigration judge’s reliance on the “heart of\n\nthe claim” standard for assessing credibility.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the petition is denied.\n\n\n\n\nwhere presumption of regularity attaches to agency action absent\npetitioner putting forth “concrete evidence” to the contrary);\nMcLeod v. INS, 802 F.2d 89, 94-95 & n.8 (3d Cir. 1986) (same).\n\n                              -12-\n\f",

Petitioner Lifei Lin, a\n\ncitizen of the People’s Republic of China, applied for asylum,\n\nrelief from withholding of removal and relief under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture on the ground that he had been arrested and\n\nmistreated by Chinese authorities due to violations of Chinese\n\nfamily planning laws. Lin seeks review of the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals’ July 25, 2007, decision dismissing his appeal from an\n\nimmigration judge’s March 20, 2006, decision, which denied his\n\napplication for asylum and withholding of removal.1             This Court’s\n\njurisdiction      is governed by section 242 of the Immigration and\n\nNationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, as amended by the REAL ID Act of\n\n2005, Pub.

For\n\nthe following reasons we deny the petition.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n     The immigration judge also denied Lin’s request for protection\npursuant to the Convention Against Terror, but Lin did not appeal\nthat part of the decision.\n\n                                    -2-\n\f                                    I.\n\n      Mr. Lin was born in Fuzhou City, China, on March 7, 1983.            He\n\n“married” on September 10, 2002, with a celebration among family\n\nand   friends,   but   Lin   acknowledges   that   the   marriage   was   not\n\nofficial because both the bride and groom were underage under\n\nChinese law.     A child was born to the union on November 17, 2003.\n\nLin’s “wife” and son remain in China.              Upon learning of the\n\npregnancy and the underage marriage, the authorities arrested Lin.\n\nLin claims he was detained by authorities when he refused to\n\ndisclose the whereabouts of his girlfriend for fear she would be\n\nforced to abort and because he was unable to pay the fine.                Lin\n\nleft China in 2003 because he feared future persecution based on\n\nhis failure to follow China’s family planning laws by marrying\n\nunderage and by having a child without permission, as well as his\n\nfailure to pay a fine imposed due to the violations.\n\n      After leaving his home, Lin went into hiding – first in China,\n\nthen in Holland and Peru.      He eventually made his way to the United\n\nStates and arrived at Miami International Airport on February 6,\n\n2005.   Lin had no valid travel documents or other papers and paid\n\n$7,000 or $8,000 for a smuggler to get him into the United States.\n\nHe requested political asylum and said he left China because he was\n\n“afraid of being punished for impregnating [his] girlfriend.”             Lin\n\nfears that he would be persecuted if he returned to China for\n\nviolations of the family planning laws.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f                                 II.\n\n     To qualify for asylum, an alien needs to demonstrate that he\n\nis a refugee due to previous persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership\n\nin a particular social group, or political opinion.           8 U.S.C. §\n\n1158(b)(1);   Berrio-Barrera v.

Lin claims persecution\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fas the result of the Chinese government’s efforts to enforce its\n\ncoerced population control policies, including the possibility of\n\nforced sterilization for him or his girlfriend should he return to\n\nChina.\n\n     Lin’s applications were denied because the immigration judge\n\nfound that he lacked credibility, primarily due to inconsistencies\n\namong his testimony at the hearing, his asylum application and\n\nstatements made during two interviews held shortly after he entered\n\nthe country.    See Oral Decision of the Immigration Judge at 9-11.\n\nThe immigration judge set out numerous discrepancies in detail in\n\nher decision.   Based on these discrepancies, the immigration judge\n\ndiscredited the majority of Lin’s claimed fear of persecution and\n\ntorture should he return to China.\n\n     For example, the immigration      judge found a discrepancy as to\n\nwhen Lin’s girlfriend’s pregnancy was reported to the authorities.\n\nLin testified at his hearing that his “wife” had been pregnant for\n\nlittle over a month when the authorities found out, but notes taken\n\nduring an earlier credible fear interview suggest that she was five\n\nmonths pregnant. The immigration judge also found a discrepancy as\n\nto the reasons given by Lin for his detention by the authorities.\n\nLin did not mention during his credible-fear interview any concern\n\nabout his girlfriend being forced to have an abortion or fear that\n\neither or both of them would be forcibly sterilized at a later\n\ndate.    The only fear Lin expressed at that time about returning to\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fChina concerned the punishment he might face for his failure to pay\n\nthe   fine.     Later,   however,   during     direct   examination        at   the\n\nhearing, Lin expressed a fear of forced sterilization should he\n\nreturn to China.      He also testified that he fled China because he\n\nfeared further beatings based on the beating he says he received by\n\nChinese authorities when he refused to divulge the whereabouts of\n\nhis girlfriend for fear she would be forced to have an abortion.\n\nAlso noted by the immigration judge was a discrepancy about the\n\nduration of detention:      Lin reported the detention as lasting two\n\ndays during the asylum interview but said it was four days on\n\ndirect examination during his hearing before the immigration judge.\n\nLin also reported being beaten with an electric baton in his asylum\n\ninterview, but did not mention until his hearing that he had been\n\ninjured and hospitalized due to the beating.\n\n      The immigration judge also noted the unexplained discrepancy\n\nin why Lin originally claimed to have been arrested on January 5,\n\n2003, but then later testified that he was actually arrested on\n\nMarch   30,   2003.      Similarly,    the    immigration      judge   noted      a\n\ndiscrepancy between Lin’s application for asylum and his asylum\n\ninterview concerning the date he left China.                June 20, 2004, was\n\nthe date given at the asylum interview, but October 20 2003, is the\n\ndate Lin gave in his asylum application.             Lin has also submitted\n\ncontradictory    evidence    regarding       the   events    that   took    place\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fsubsequent to his arrest in China and prior to his arrival in the\n\nUnited States.\n\n     Based on these multiple discrepancies, the immigration judge\n\nfound that Lin had failed to meet his burden of proof with regard\n\nto his asylum application.      Because Lin failed to meet the burden\n\nof proof for asylum, he was also unable to meet the more stringent\n\nstandard    for   withholding   of   removal.      Rodriguez-Ramirez     v.\n\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201454\"><a href=\"/opinion/201454/rodriguez-ramirez-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 123 (1st Cir. 2005) (finding that because\n\nthe burden of proof necessary to establish an asylum claim is lower\n\nthan the burden of proof required to prevail on a withholding of\n\nremoval claim, “the BIA’s rejection of the petitioner's asylum\n\nclaim, if sustainable, sounds the death knell for his counterpart\n\nclaim for withholding of removal”).\n\n     Lin appealed the denial of his applications to the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals, which affirmed on the ground that the adverse\n\ncredibility finding was not clearly erroneous.           The Board decision\n\nfocused primarily on the discrepancies concerning various dates,\n\nsuch as when Lin left China, when he was arrested, and the date on\n\nwhich his girlfriend’s pregnancy was discovered by the authorities\n\nas well as the circumstances surrounding the disclosure of the\n\npregnancy    to   the   authorities.       The   Board    also   noted   the\n\ninconsistencies in Lin’s statements concerning the events that took\n\nplace after he was arrested and his activities and whereabouts\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fprior to entering the United States.                    Decision of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals, July 25, 2007.\n\n      Lin petitions this Court for review of the Board’s decision.\n\nHe contends that the adverse credibility finding was not supported\n\nby substantial evidence.            We review the Board’s findings of fact\n\nunder a substantial evidence standard, under which the agency’s\n\nfindings are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be\n\ncompelled to conclude to the contrary. We review the entire record\n\nto   assess      whether    the    findings      are    supported   by    substantial\n\nevidence.      Where the Board adopts the immigration judge’s ruling,\n\nbut also engages in discussion of its own, as here, we review both\n\ndecisions.       Hem v.

Under\n\nthe deferential substantial evidence standard, we consider whether\n\nthe agency’s ruling is supported by “reasonable, substantial and\n\nprobative evidence on the record as a whole.”                        INS v.

Upon review of the entire\n\nrecord, we hold that substantial evidence supports the findings of\n\nthe immigration judge as affirmed by the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals.      The discrepancies are well documented in the immigration\n\njudge’s    decision        and    the   record    does    not    compel   a   contrary\n\nconclusion.\n\n      Lin also contends that the Board violated its scope of review\n\nbecause     it    impermissibly         engaged    in     fact    finding     when   it\n\n“determined that Lin originally claimed to have been arrested on\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fJanuary 5, 2003, but then later testified that the event occurred\n\non March 30, 2003.”     Lin claims the immigration judge made no such\n\nfinding in her decision.      Petitioner’s Br. at 10.    Contrary to\n\nLin’s argument, however, the immigration judge explicitly found a\n\ndiscrepancy when she said “in the asylum interview respondent\n\nasserts he was arrested on January 5, 2003, as opposed to March 30,\n\n2003, according to his direct testimony.”       Oral Decision of the\n\nImmigration Judge at 11.      Accordingly, Lin’s argument concerning\n\nimpermissible fact finding by the Board fails.\n\n     Lin also argues that his due process rights were violated\n\nbecause the immigration judge did not clearly indicate that new\n\namendments to the REAL ID Act2 applied to Lin’s asylum application\n\n\n     2\n         The new language provides:\n\n     Credibility determination. Considering the totality of\n     the circumstances, and all relevant factors, a trier of\n     fact may base a credibility determination on the\n     demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant or\n     witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant’s or\n     witness’s   account,   the   consistency   between   the\n     applicant’s or witness’s written and oral statements\n     (whenever made and whether or not under oath, and\n     considering the circumstances under which the statements\n     were made), the internal consistency of each such\n     statement, the consistency of such statements with other\n     evidence of record (including the reports of the\n     Department of State on country conditions), and any\n     inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without\n     regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or\n     falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant’s claim, or\n     any other relevant factor.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); see also 8 U.S.C. §§ 1231(b)(3)(C)\n&   1229a(c)(4)(C)   (credibility   determination   for   removal\nproceeding).\n\n                                  -9-\n\fand yet the Board, on appeal, explicitly applied the provisions.\n\nThe import of the amendments to the REAL ID Act is to eliminate the\n\n“heart of the claim” rule and instead to rely on a “totality of the\n\ncircumstances” rule in making credibility determinations.      The\n\nchange allows the immigration judge to make credibility findings\n\nbased on all the evidence – not just evidence that goes to the\n\n“heart” of the petitioner’s claims.
