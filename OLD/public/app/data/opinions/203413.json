Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n               Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Paul Beetz on brief pro se.\n     Thomas Nicholson and Finneran & Nicholson, on brief for\nappellee, Ambrosi.\n     Doyle C.

Paul Beetz, III, a Nebraska attorney acting\n\npro se, appeals the district court's order dismissing his civil\n\naction with prejudice for failure to comply with a court-ordered\n\nfiling deadline. After careful review, we conclude that dismissing\n\nthe action with prejudice on the stated ground amounted to an abuse\n\nof discretion.      See Ruiz-Rosa v. Rullan, 485 F.3d 150, 153 (1st\n\nCir. 2007) (a district court's use of dismissal with prejudice as\n\na sanction is reviewed for abuse of discretion).\n\n            By    order   dated   July   17,   2007,   the   district   court\n\ndetermined that Beetz's complaint failed to satisfy the pleading\n\nstandards set forth in Rule 8 and Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure and warned that the complaint would be dismissed\n\nunless Beetz filed an amended complaint that \"conform[ed] to the\n\ncivil rules\" within thirty days.         On August 23, 2007, the district\n\ncourt issued an order dismissing the case with prejudice on the\n\nground that Beetz had failed to file an amended complaint by the\n\ndeadline set in the July 17 order.\n\n            Beetz filed an amended complaint on August 28, 2007, but\n\ndue   to   some    apparent   docketing    irregularities,     the   amended\n\ncomplaint was not entered on the electronic docket until some\n\nmonths later.      On August 30, 2007, the district court entered a\n\nfinal order of dismissal \"in accordance with [the] . . . order\n\nentered on August 23, 2007.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f          On appeal, Beetz concedes that he did not file an amended\n\ncomplaint within thirty days of the July 17, 2007, order, but he\n\ncontends that his amended complaint was nevertheless timely because\n\nthe district court had implicitly granted an extension of the\n\nfiling deadline in an electronic order entered July 30, 2007.   The\n\nelectronic order Beetz cites simply granted, without comment, a\n\nmotion by Beetz's attorney which requested leave to withdraw as\n\ncounsel as well as an extension of \"at least\" thirty days to file\n\nthe amended complaint.   Defendants argue that the court's failure\n\nto expressly address the request for an extension when it ruled on\n\nthe motion should be read as an implicit denial of that relief.\n\nHowever, in the absence of any qualifying language or other signal\n\nof disapproval, we think that the court's order is more sensibly\n\nread as implicitly granting the motion in its entirety.         The\n\ndeadline for filing the amended complaint therefore would have been\n\nextended until at least mid-September, making Beetz's amended\n\ncomplaint, filed on August 28, 2007, timely.   Whether the district\n\ncourt was aware that the amended complaint had been filed is\n\nunclear in light of the docketing irregularities noted above;\n\nhowever, since the fault for that confusion does not appear to be\n\nattributable to Beetz, the case should not have been dismissed\n\nsolely for failure to comply with the original deadline.\n\n          Defendants alternatively argue that, even if the amended\n\ncomplaint was not untimely, the dismissal should be affirmed\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fbecause the amended complaint Beetz submitted suffered from the\n\nsame defects as the original and therefore did not comply with the\n\ncourt's order to file an amended complaint that \"conform[ed] to the\n\ncivil    rules.\"     However,   whether     the   complaint   as   amended   is\n\nsufficient to comply with pleading requirements or to state a claim\n\nfor relief are questions that must be determined by the district\n\ncourt in the first instance.          We cannot affirm on the basis of a\n\ndiscretion    that   the   district    court   did   not   exercise.    Clair\n\nRecreation Center, Inc. v. Flynn, 897 F.2d 623, 624 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).\n\n            In sum, since the district court implicitly granted an\n\nextension of time to file the amended complaint and Beetz complied\n\nwith the extended deadline, we find that dismissing the case solely\n\nfor failure to comply with the original deadline amounted to an\n\nabuse of discretion. Accordingly, we vacate the order of dismissal\n\nand remand to allow the district court an opportunity to assess the\n\nsufficiency of the amended complaint and to conduct any further\n\nproceedings deemed appropriate.         No costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f",
