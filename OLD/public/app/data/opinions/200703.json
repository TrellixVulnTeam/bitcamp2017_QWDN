Marcus Kennedy appeals the district court’s\n\norder dismissing his complaint against the United States for\n\nfailure to state a claim.        See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).           We affirm\n\nessentially    for    the    reasons   stated      in   the   district    court's\n\nmemorandum of decision, dated November 26, 2002, adding only the\n\nfollowing.\n\n           We review de novo the district court's grant of a Rule\n\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.                 Martin v.\n\nApplied Cellular Tech., Inc., 284 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nKennedy filed his complaint against the United States and Mark\n\nRadcliff1 under the Federal Tort Claims Act, alleging that the\n\nUnited   States      was    liable   for   false    imprisonment,    malicious\n\nprosecution and infliction of emotional harm and distress because\n\nof Radcliff’s actions.          Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the\n\nUnited States is liable for the acts of an employee only if the\n\nemployee was acting within the scope of his or her employment.                See\n\n28 U.S.C.A. § 1346(b)(West 2003). The substantive law of the State\n\nwhere the act or omission occurred governs this inquiry.                        In\n\nMassachusetts, the “conduct of an agent is within the scope of\n\nemployment if it is of the kind he is employed to perform; if it\n\noccurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits;\n\nand if it is motivated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the\n\n\n     1\n      Radcliff was also a named defendant, but he was never\nproperly served, leading the district court to dismiss, without\nprejudice, all of the claims against him.\n\n                                       -2-\n\femployer.”     Wang Laboratories, Inc. v. Business Incentives, Inc.,\n\n501 N.E.2d 1163, 1166 (Mass. 1986)(internal citations omitted),\n\nquoted in Kelly v. United States, 924 F.2d 355, 357 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).\n\n          According to the complaint, Radcliff was, at the time in\n\nquestion, an employee of the Department of Housing and Urban\n\nDevelopment.     During an evening of socializing and drinking with\n\nKennedy, he allegedly gave false and misleading information to the\n\nBoston Police, leading them to search Kennedy’s home and car, find\n\nKennedy in possession of a firearm (left in his car by Radcliff),\n\narrest Kennedy and file several criminal charges against him, all\n\nof which were subsequently dropped when the Boston Police realized\n\nthat Radcliff had intentionally given them false and misleading\n\ninformation.    The complaint further alleges that Radcliff told the\n\npolice that he, Radcliff, was an undercover federal agent and that\n\nKennedy was his informant.\n\n             The district court concluded that the allegations in the\n\ncomplaint could not support a claim that Radcliff was acting within\n\nthe scope of his employment.      We agree.   As the district court\n\nnoted, Kennedy himself contends in Attachment A to the complaint\n\nthat Radcliff was lying when he told the Boston Police that he was\n\nan undercover federal agent. Accepting that allegation as true, as\n\nwe must, it is impossible to conceive of a theory under which\n\nRadcliff’s actions that evening could have been within the scope of\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fhis employment.   Accordingly, the complaint against the United\n\nStates was properly dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -4-\n\f",
