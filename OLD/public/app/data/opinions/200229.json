Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                      Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n\n           Campbell and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Rafael F. Castro-Lang for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nGuillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco,\nAssistant United States Attorney, Chief, Criminal Division, were on\nbrief for the United States.\n\n\n\n                         December 2, 2002\n\f           CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.            This appeal raises,\n\ninter alia, the question of which statutory provision governs the\n\ndistrict court's imposition of a term of supervised release upon a\n\ndrug offender.    A statute pertaining to federal crimes in general\n\nprovides that for Class A and Class B felonies, the maximum\n\nsupervised release term is five years.         18 U.S.C. § 3583(b)(2000).\n\nAnother statute, however, making criminal the drug offenses under\n\nwhich this defendant was sentenced, provides for somewhat different\n\nterms of supervised release and, in the defendant's circumstances,\n\nmandates a supervised release term of \"at least five years.\"               21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A) (1999).              Most of the courts of appeal\n\nconsidering the issue have held that the latter statute, 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841, rather than 18 U.S.C. § 3583(b), determines the limits of\n\nthe supervised release terms a district court may impose upon drug\n\noffenders sentenced thereunder. These same courts have interpreted\n\nthe \"at least\" terminology as implying that, in such cases, a term\n\nof   supervised   release   longer    than    five   years   is   statutorily\n\nauthorized.\n\n           Having pled guilty in the district court to a drug\n\nconspiracy    charge   involving,      as     the    conspiracy's     object,\n\nsubstantive offenses under 21 U.S.C. § 841(a), William Cortes-\n\nClaudio (\"Cortes-Claudio\") was sentenced to imprisonment and a ten-\n\nyear term of supervised release.             He appeals from the latter,\n\narguing on the basis of 18 U.S.C. § 3583(b) that the maximum\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fsupervisory release term is five years.     He also argues that the\n\ndistrict court committed plain error by neglecting to give him\n\nadvance notice that it was considering an upward departure (to ten\n\nyears) from the five year supervised release term provided in the\n\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines.   See U.S.S.G. § 5D1.2(a)(1)\n\n(2001).\n\n          We conclude that 21 U.S.C. § 841(b) controls, and that it\n\nconfers statutory authority upon the district court to impose the\n\nten-year term of supervised release that it chose.     The district\n\ncourt erred, however, in overlooking the Sentencing Guidelines\n\nprovision for a supervised release term of five years.     The ten-\n\nyear term was thus an upward departure requiring the court to give\n\nprior notice, see United States v. Burns, 501 U.S. 129, 135 (1990),\n\nand to state on the record the aggravating circumstances that\n\nwarranted such a departure.    Since the district court observed\n\nneither requirement, we vacate and remand for re-sentencing of\n\nCortes-Claudio's supervised release term.\n\nI.        Background\n\n          Cortes-Claudio, pursuant to a plea agreement, pleaded\n\nguilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five\n\nkilograms or more of cocaine, one or more kilograms of heroin, and\n\nmulti-kilograms of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1)\n\n(1999).   The plea agreement set forth the statutory penalties for\n\nCortes-Claudio's offense including \"a term of imprisonment which\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fmay not be less than ten years or more than life\" and a \"term of\n\nsupervised release of at least 5 years.\" § 841(b)(1)(A).                    While\n\nCortes-Claudio and the government agreed to a term of imprisonment\n\nof   151   months,     the   parties   did    not   stipulate   to   a   specific\n\nsupervised release term.         As to the supervised release term, the\n\nplea agreement parroted the language of § 841(b) stating that \"the\n\ndefendant understands that he can be sentenced to . . . a term of\n\nsupervised release of at least five (5) years.\"\n\n            Neither the pre-sentence report, nor the district court's\n\ncolloquy    at   the    change   of    plea    hearing,   stated     a   specific\n\nsupervised release term.         The pre-sentence report indicated that\n\nthe court \"must impose a term of supervised release of at least\n\nfive (5) years\" and that the term of supervised release \"shall in\n\nno event be less than any statutorily required term.\"                    The pre-\n\nsentence report also stated that there was no basis for a departure\n\nfrom the Guidelines.          At the change of plea hearing, the judge\n\ninformed Cortes-Claudio of the sentence he could receive upon\n\npleading guilty, including \"a supervised release term of not less\n\nthan five years.\"\n\n            Later, at the sentencing hearing, following a discussion\n\nconcerning an error in the pre-sentence report regarding a prior\n\nconviction, the district court sentenced Cortes-Claudio to 151\n\nmonths imprisonment and ten years of supervised release.                  Cortes-\n\nClaudio did not object.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f              Following sentencing, however, Cortes-Claudio filed a\n\nmotion to correct his sentence.          Believing the district court had\n\nrelied upon a prior conviction to increase his term of supervised\n\nrelease from five years to ten years, Cortes-Claudio stated in his\n\nmotion that the district court had inadvertently imposed the ten-\n\nyear supervised release term required by § 841(b) for a defendant\n\nwith a prior conviction. He argued that because the government had\n\nfailed   to    file   an   information   pursuant   to   21   U.S.C.   §   851,\n\nindicating its intent to seek a higher sentence based on a prior\n\nconviction, the maximum allowable supervised release term was five\n\nyears.   18 U.S.C. § 3583(b)(1).\n\n              The district court denied Cortes-Claudio's motion to\n\ncorrect his sentence.         United States v. Cortes-Claudio, 152 F.\n\nSupp.2d 177, 178 (D.P.R. 2001).          The court stated that it had not\n\nrelied upon a prior conviction in setting Cortes-Claudio's term of\n\nsupervised release.        While the court recognized that 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3583(b) provided for a maximum term of supervised release of five\n\nyears for a Class A felony,1 it concluded that the supervised\n\nrelease provisions in § 841(b) trumped the maximums provided in §\n\n3583(b).      According to the court, the requirement in § 841(b) of\n\na minimum supervised release term of \"at least 5 years\" permitted\n\nthe court, in its discretion, to impose a supervised release term\n\n\n     1\n      Because the maximum term of incarceration authorized by law\nis life imprisonment, see § 841(b), Cortes-Claudio's offense is\ncategorized as a Class A felony. 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(1).\n\n                                     -5-\n\fof up to life.    Id. at 180.   The court stated that ten years was\n\nappropriate given the nature of Cortes-Claudio's offense.\n\n            According to the district court, in arriving at the ten-\n\nyear supervised release term, it considered all the relevant\n\nevidence and circumstances \"as well as the factors set forth in 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a)(2).\"    Id. at 180-81.    The district court stated\n\nthat both the terms of imprisonment and the supervised release term\n\nwere \"within the sentencing guidelines and appropriate considering\n\nthe nature of the offense.\" Id. at 181.\n\nII.         Discussion\n\nA.          Statutory Length of Supervised Release Terms\n\n            The first issue is whether the five-year maximum provided\n\nin 18 U.S.C. § 3583 is applicable as a limitation           upon the\n\nsupervised release term of Cortes-Claudio who was sentenced for\n\ndrug offenses pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 841(b).\n\n            We begin with a close look at the language of the two\n\nstatutes.   See Brady v. Credit Recovery Inc., 160 F.3d 64, 66 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).     Defendants convicted of conspiracy to commit drug\n\noffenses pursuant to 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a) and 846, are subject to\n\nthe penalties described in § 841(b).2     Pursuant to § 841(b)(1)(A),\n\n\n      2\n      Section 841(b)(1)(A) describes penalties for defendants, like\nCortes-Claudio, convicted of drug offenses, including conspiracy,\nsee § 846, involving a particular quantity of drugs. The statute\nrequires, in pertinent part, \"such person to be sentenced to a term\nof imprisonment which may not be less than 10 years or more than\nlife and if death or serious bodily injury results from the use of\nsuch substance shall be not less than 20 years or more than\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthe district court was required to sentence Cortes-Claudio to a\n\nterm of imprisonment which could not be less than \"10 years or more\n\nthan life\" and a term of supervised release of \"at least 5 years.\"\n\nWe have recently held that this language in § 841(b) establishes a\n\nmandatory minimum term of supervised release, not a maximum.\n\nUnited States v. Lopez, 299 F.3d 84, 90 (1st Cir. 2002).        Our\n\nholding in Lopez made clear that any apparent language to the\n\ncontrary in previous cases is limited to the specific facts of\n\nthose cases, and does not constitute precedent for the proposition\n\nthat language in drug statutes, such as 21 U.S.C. § 841, referring\n\nto \"at least 5 years\" (or some other term) sets out the maximum\n\nrather than a minimum only.   United States v. Barnes, 251 F.3d 251,\n\n261 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Barnes, 244 F.3d 172, 178\n\n(1st Cir. 2001); Suveges v. United States, 7 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).     Given the plain meaning of \"at least\" and our Lopez\n\nholding,   we do not regard Barnes and its companion cases as stare\n\ndecisis in regard to the present issue concerning the upper limit\n\nof a term of supervised release in a drug case.\n\n           We start, therefore, with the premise that the district\n\ncourt was plainly required by § 841(b) to sentence Cortes-Claudio\n\nto a minimum supervised release term of at least five years.     In\n\n\nlife . . . . Any sentence under this subparagraph shall, in the\nabsence of such prior conviction, impose a term of supervised\nrelease of at least five years in addition to such term of\nimprisonment and shall, if there was such a prior conviction,\nimpose a term of supervised release of at least 10 years . . . .\"\n\n                                 -7-\n\farguing that five years is also a maximum in respect to the\n\npermissible term of supervised relief, Cortes-Claudio would have us\n\nborrow from a different statute, § 3583(b), applying to federal\n\ncrimes generally.   Section 3583(b) specifies,\n\n          Except as otherwise provided, the authorized\n          terms of supervised release are --\n          (1) for a Class A or Class B felony, not more\n          than five years;\n          (2) for a Class C or Class D felony, not more\n          than three years; and\n          (3) for a Class E felony, or for misdemeanor\n          (other than a petty offense) not more than one\n          year.\n\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3583(b)(emphasis supplied). Because Cortes-Claudio was\n\nconvicted of a Class A felony, he argues that he is subject to a\n\nterm of supervised release of \"not more than five years.\"\n\n          The issue presented is whether § 841(b), which contains\n\nsentences applicable to specific drug offenses and conspiracy to\n\ncommit such offenses, under which Cortes-Claudio was sentenced,\n\ntakes precedence over the more general § 3583(b) in regard not only\n\nto the minimum five-year term expressly set forth in § 841(b) but\n\nalso to the unspecified lengthier terms implied if not specifically\n\nset forth in the \"at least\" phraseology.   We think it does.   In so\n\nholding, we join the majority of circuits that have considered this\n\nissue and that have held that § 3583(b) does not limit the length\n\nof supervised release terms in cases under § 841.     E.g., United\n\nStates v. Sanchez-Gonzalez, 294 F.3d 563, 565 (3d Cir. 2002);\n\nUnited States v. Kurkowski, 281 F.3d 699, 703 (8th Cir.), cert.\n\n                               -8-\n\fdenied, 123 S. Ct. 210 (2002); United States v. Sanchez, 269 F.3d\n\n1250, 1286-88 (11th Cir. 2001) (en banc), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct.\n\n1327 (2002); United States v. Page, 131 F.3d 1173, 1178 (6th Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 525 U.S. 828 (1998); United States v. Eng, 14 F.3d\n\n165, 172 (2d Cir. 1994).3\n\n           The language of § 3583(b), as well as of § 841, supports\n\nthe conclusion that penalties for drug offenses within the latter\n\nshould be imposed with direct reference to § 841(b), not § 3583(b).\n\nSection   3583(b)   itself   begins   with    the   phrase   \"[e]xcept   as\n\notherwise provided.\"   This proviso indicates that § 3583(b) yields\n\nto other more specific statutes, such as § 841, that make different\n\nprovisions for terms of supervised release for particular offenses.\n\nSee, e.g., Sanchez-Gonzalez, 294 F.3d at 566; Eng, 14 F.3d at 172.\n\nBecause § 841 does \"otherwise provide\" supervised release terms,\n\nits provisions rather than those of § 3583(b) apply to drug\n\noffenders like Cortes-Claudio.\n\n           It is true that § 841(b) does not set out a specific\n\nmaximum term of supervised release.          It does, however, require a\n\n\n\n     3\n       Only the Fourth and Fifth Circuits have determined that §\n3583(b) limits the length of a supervised release term imposed\npursuant to § 841. E.g., United States v. Good, 25 F.3d 218, 221\n(4th Cir. 1994); United States v. Kelly, 974 F.2d 22, 25 (5th Cir.\n1992). As the Fourth Circuit recently recognized, the reasoning\nadopted by these circuits can lead, in some instances, to clearly\ninappropriate results. United States v. Pratt, 239 F.3d 640, 647\nn.4 (4th Cir. 2001) (recognizing that this rule \"creates a somewhat\nanomalous result\" and opining that perhaps its decision in Good\nshould be overruled).\n\n                                  -9-\n\fminimum term of supervised release of \"at least five years,\" and\n\nthis phraseology plainly implies the option of a term longer than\n\nfive years.     To allow § 3583(b) to limit to five years the\n\nsupervised release term set forth in § 841(b) would, in Cortes-\n\nClaudio's case, rob the phrase \"at least\" contained in the latter\n\nstatute of any meaning whatever.           See, e.g., United States v.\n\nWilliams, 65 F.3d 301, 309 (2d Cir. 1995).              It is \"a cardinal\n\nprinciple of statutory construction\" that \"a statute ought, upon\n\nthe whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no\n\nclause,   sentence,    or   word   shall     be    superfluous,    void,    or\n\ninsignificant.\"       Duncan v.    Walker,   533    U.S.   167,   174   (2001)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted); Herman v. Hector I. Nieves\n\nTransp., Inc., 244 F.3d 32, 36 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"A primary canon of\n\nstatutory construction is that a statute should be construed so as\n\nnot to render any of its phrases superfluous.\").           A further reason\n\nfor not imputing § 3583(b)'s five-year maximum term to § 841\n\noffenders is that, in some other instances, this would actually\n\nmake it impossible to carry out the specific mandates set forth in\n\n§ 841.    See Eng, 14 F.3d at 172 (dividing cases under § 841 into\n\ndifferent categories, including those like the present where §\n\n841(b)'s mandatory minimums would be § 3583(b)'s maximum, and\n\nothers where an actual conflict would exist between the minimum\n\nperiod of supervised release mandated under § 841 and the maximum\n\npermitted by § 3583).\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f               Our interpretation of the two statutes is consistent with\n\nthe legislative history.              See Page, 131 F.3d at 1179.          When\n\nCongress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, it amended §\n\n3583(b) to add the phrase \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided\" at the\n\nsame time it included the supervised release terms set forth in §\n\n841(b) and maintained the words \"at least\" before the specified\n\nminimum term.         Act of Oct. 27, 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-570, 1986\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. (100 Stat.) 3207-6.4\n\n               Defendants convicted of drug offenses have traditionally\n\nbeen       subject   to   sentences   different   from   those   imposed   upon\n\ndefendants convicted under other federal laws.               See Bifulco v.\n\nUnited States, 447 U.S. 381, 392 (1980).           Prior to the creation of\n\nthe \"supervised release term\" to which defendants now must be\n\nsentenced,      defendants     generally   were   subject   to   a   period   of\n\n\"parole.\" As defendants were often released prior to serving their\n\nentire sentence, the length of a non-drug offender's parole was\n\nnormally dictated by how much time remained on his or her original\n\n\n       4\n      Our interpretation is also consistent with how courts\ninterpreted the statute prior to the adoption of the sentencing\nguidelines.    Specifically, Congress provided that a defendant\nsentenced under the prior version of § 841 be subject to \"at least\nfive years of special parole.\"          Courts interpreting this\nphraseology assumed that Congress provided a mandatory minimum term\nof special parole with a possible special parole term of life.\nSee, e.g., Fowler v. United States Parole Comm'n, 94 F.3d 835, 840\n(3rd Cir. 1996); People v. Materne, 72 F.3d 103, 106 (9th Cir.\n1995); United States v. Osment, 13 F.3d 1240, 1242 (8th Cir. 1994).\nExcept for the substitution of \"supervised release term\" for \"term\nof special parole\" the language of § 841 remained largely intact\nafter Congress instituted the sentencing guidelines.\n\n                                        -11-\n\fsentence.     Defendants convicted of drug offenses, however, were\n\nrequired to be sentenced by statute to a \"special parole term\" that\n\nwas distinct from their original sentence.             See id. (noting the\n\nintent of the special parole term was \"to give the judges another\n\ntool for sentencing and another means of protecting society when\n\ndealing with the drug violator.\"). When Congress eliminated parole\n\nand instituted in its stead supervised release terms, it continued\n\nto treat drug offenders separately from other criminals in respect\n\nto supervised release, substituting \"supervised release term\" for\n\n\"special parole term\" in § 841(b) and providing specific directions\n\nrelative to those sentenced under that statute.            See Gozlon-Peretz\n\nv. United States, 498 U.S. 395, 402 (1991).\n\n            We, therefore, find no error in the district court's\n\nconclusion    that   the   statutory      supervised   release     terms      for\n\ndefendants    convicted    of   drug    offenses   under   §   841(a)   are    as\n\ndescribed in § 841(b), and that those run from the mandatory\n\nminimum up to the life of the defendant. Section 841(b)(1)(A), the\n\nprovision under which Cortes-Claudio was sentenced, provides for a\n\nmandatory minimum term of at least five years of supervised release\n\nup to a maximum supervised release term of life.\n\nB.           Sentencing Guidelines and Supervised Release Terms\n\n             Even assuming that the court had statutory authority to\n\nimpose a ten-year term of supervised release, Cortes-Claudio argues\n\nthat the district court committed error when it sua sponte departed\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fupward from the supervised release term set forth in the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines.      See 18 U.S.C. §§ 3553(a) and 3553(b) (2000); U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 5K2 (2001).         According to Cortes-Claudio, the Guidelines, if not\n\nthe   statute     under    which    he   was    sentenced,    mandates     that   the\n\ndistrict court impose a term of five years supervised release. See\n\n§ 5D1.2.        Relying on § 5D1.2 of the Guidelines, Cortes-Claudio\n\ncontends that his ten-year supervised release term was an upward\n\ndeparture from the guideline range.                 If the court intended to\n\ndepart from the guideline sentence, Cortes-Claudio contends that it\n\nwas required to provide advance notice to the parties.                    See United\n\nStates v. Burns, 501 U.S. 129, 135 (1990) (holding that a district\n\ncourt may       not    sua sponte    upwardly     depart     from   the   guideline\n\nsentencing range without first notifying the defendant of its\n\nintention to do so and specifically identifying the ground on which\n\nit contemplates departing upward).\n\n            A district court is required by statute to sentence\n\nwithin    the    guideline     range     absent    aggravating      or    mitigating\n\ncircumstances. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). Under the Guidelines, Cortes-\n\nClaudio was subject to a five-year supervised release term.                         §\n\n5D1.2(a)(1); see also United States v. Sasson, 62 F.3d 874, 891\n\n(7th Cir. 1995).          Section 5D1.2(a)(1) provides that if a term of\n\nsupervised release is ordered the length of the term for a Class A\n\nor B felony \"shall be at least three years but not more than five\n\nyears.\"    The term of supervised release imposed, however, cannot\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fdrop below the statutory minimum.         5D1.2(b).   Here, the guideline\n\nrange for supervised release was three to five years and the\n\nstatutorily required minimum sentence was five years.              Thus, the\n\nguideline sentence was five years, with no special exception for\n\ndrug offenses.     See United States v. Mora, 22 F.3d 409, 413 (2d\n\nCir. 1994).       A sentence that exceeds the guideline range is\n\nconsidered an \"upward departure.\" See United States v. Harotunian,\n\n920 F.2d 1040, 1042-43 (1st Cir.1990) (defining a departure as a\n\nsentence outside the guideline sentencing range).            Thus, when the\n\ndistrict court imposed a ten-year supervised release term, it\n\ndeparted upward from the Guideline sentence, requiring advance\n\nnotice to the parties, Burns, 501 U.S. at 138-39, and also an\n\nexplanation for the departure. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b); § 5K2 U.S.S.G.\n\n          Here the court apparently overlooked the fact that it was\n\ndeparting from the guideline range when it imposed a ten-year term\n\nof   supervised    release.   It    stated     that   both   the    term   of\n\nimprisonment and the ten years of supervised release were \"within\n\nthe sentencing guidelines.\" Cortes-Claudio, 152 F. Supp.2d at 181.\n\nThis faulty assumption led to the two additional errors already\n\nsuggested.    The court did not provide the parties notice of a\n\npotential upward departure, see Burns, 501 U.S. at 135, and the\n\ncourt did not make the required findings of an aggravating or\n\nmitigating circumstance to support the departure, see Sasson, 62\n\nF.3d at 891 (requiring advance notice and an explanation for an\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fupward departure from five years supervised release to ten years\n\nsupervised release); Eng, 14 F.3d at 171 (concluding that judge had\n\nto find \"aggravating circumstance\" before departing upward to a\n\nlife time supervised release term); United States v. Stevens, 985\n\nF.2d 1175, 1188 (2d Cir. 1993) (requiring advance notice and a\n\nstatement of reasons for departure for a life supervised release\n\nterm).\n\n           Cortes-Claudio did not, it is true, object at the time of\n\nsentencing to the supervised release term. Generally, when a party\n\nfails to contemporaneously object to an error in sentencing we\n\nreview only for plain error.      United States v. Albanese, 287 F.3d\n\n226, 227 (1st Cir. 2002).      We have recognized, however, in the\n\ncontext of sentencing, that a post-sentence objection is not\n\nnecessarily required to preserve the issue for appeal if the\n\ndefendant could not reasonably have anticipated the issue would\n\narise until after the court ruled.        United States v. Gallant, 306\n\nF.3d 1181, 1188-89 (1st Cir. 2002); see also United States v.\n\nSofsky, 287 F.3d 122, 125 (2d Cir. 2002) (concluding that in the\n\nsentencing context there are circumstances that permit a court to\n\nrelax the otherwise rigorous standards of plain error review to\n\ncorrect   sentencing   errors).     The    defendant   could   not   have\n\nanticipated the district court's decision to impose a ten-year\n\nsupervised release term.   Neither the pre-sentence report nor the\n\nAssistant United States Attorney advocated a sentence that exceeded\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fthe guidelines range.       Nor did the court provide notice to the\n\nparties that it intended to depart from the guideline sentence.\n\nAnd it did not invite argument on the length of the supervised\n\nrelease   term.    Until    the   court   announced    the    sentence,    the\n\ndefendant   was   without   actual   or   constructive       notice   of   the\n\nlikelihood of a term of supervised release that exceeded the\n\nguideline range.   As in Gallant, \"given the facts here, we think it\n\nsimply would be unfair and unwise as a matter of policy\" to hold\n\nthat Cortes-Claudio waived this argument.        306 F.3d at 1189.         We\n\nthus need not reach the question whether the upward departure\n\namounted to plain error.      But see United States v. Mangone, 105\n\nF.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir. 1997) (lack of Burns notice constituted plain\n\nerror); United States v. Carmichael, 216 F.3d 224, 227 (2d Cir.\n\n2000) (finding plain error when supervised release term exceeded\n\nterm allowed by guidelines); United States v. Valentine, 21 F.3d\n\n395, 398 (11th Cir. 1994) (lack of Burns notice was plain error).\n\n            We accordingly vacate the ten-year supervised release\n\nterm and remand to the district court for re-sentencing as to the\n\nlength of the term of supervised release.             Should the district\n\ncourt believe that aggravating circumstances \"of a kind, or to a\n\ndegree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing\n\nCommission\" appear to justify an upward departure, it must give\n\nadvance notice to the defendant and the government and the grounds\n\nof its likely intent to depart upward.       See Burns, 501 U.S. at 135.\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fIf the court thereafter finds that aggravating circumstances not\n\nconsidered by the Sentencing Commission are such as to warrant a\n\nsentence different from that proscribed in the Guidelines, it must\n\nset forth those reasons on the record.   18 U.S.C. § 3553.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -17-\n\f",

Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                      Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n\n           Campbell and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Rafael F.

Vega-Pacheco,\nAssistant United States Attorney, Chief, Criminal Division, were on\nbrief for the United States.\n\n\n\n                         December 2, 2002\n\f           CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.            This appeal raises,\n\ninter alia, the question of which statutory provision governs the\n\ndistrict court's imposition of a term of supervised release upon a\n\ndrug offender.    A statute pertaining to federal crimes in general\n\nprovides that for Class A and Class B felonies, the maximum\n\nsupervised release term is five years.         18 U.S.C. § 3583(b)(2000).\n\nAnother statute, however, making criminal the drug offenses under\n\nwhich this defendant was sentenced, provides for somewhat different\n\nterms of supervised release and, in the defendant's circumstances,\n\nmandates a supervised release term of \"at least five years.\"               21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A) (1999).              Most of the courts of appeal\n\nconsidering the issue have held that the latter statute, 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841, rather than 18 U.S.C. § 3583(b), determines the limits of\n\nthe supervised release terms a district court may impose upon drug\n\noffenders sentenced thereunder. These same courts have interpreted\n\nthe \"at least\" terminology as implying that, in such cases, a term\n\nof   supervised   release   longer    than    five   years   is   statutorily\n\nauthorized.\n\n           Having pled guilty in the district court to a drug\n\nconspiracy    charge   involving,      as     the    conspiracy's     object,\n\nsubstantive offenses under 21 U.S.C. § 841(a), William Cortes-\n\nClaudio (\"Cortes-Claudio\") was sentenced to imprisonment and a ten-\n\nyear term of supervised release.             He appeals from the latter,\n\narguing on the basis of 18 U.S.C. § 3583(b) that the maximum\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fsupervisory release term is five years.     He also argues that the\n\ndistrict court committed plain error by neglecting to give him\n\nadvance notice that it was considering an upward departure (to ten\n\nyears) from the five year supervised release term provided in the\n\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines.   See U.S.S.G. § 5D1.2(a)(1)\n\n(2001).\n\n          We conclude that 21 U.S.C. § 841(b) controls, and that it\n\nconfers statutory authority upon the district court to impose the\n\nten-year term of supervised release that it chose.     The district\n\ncourt erred, however, in overlooking the Sentencing Guidelines\n\nprovision for a supervised release term of five years.     The ten-\n\nyear term was thus an upward departure requiring the court to give\n\nprior notice, see United States v. Burns, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 135 (1990),\n\nand to state on the record the aggravating circumstances that\n\nwarranted such a departure.    Since the district court observed\n\nneither requirement, we vacate and remand for re-sentencing of\n\nCortes-Claudio's supervised release term.\n\nI.        Background\n\n          Cortes-Claudio, pursuant to a plea agreement, pleaded\n\nguilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five\n\nkilograms or more of cocaine, one or more kilograms of heroin, and\n\nmulti-kilograms of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1)\n\n(1999).   The plea agreement set forth the statutory penalties for\n\nCortes-Claudio's offense including \"a term of imprisonment which\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fmay not be less than ten years or more than life\" and a \"term of\n\nsupervised release of at least 5 years.\" § 841(b)(1)(A).                    While\n\nCortes-Claudio and the government agreed to a term of imprisonment\n\nof   151   months,     the   parties   did    not   stipulate   to   a   specific\n\nsupervised release term.         As to the supervised release term, the\n\nplea agreement parroted the language of § 841(b) stating that \"the\n\ndefendant understands that he can be sentenced to . . . a term of\n\nsupervised release of at least five (5) years.\"\n\n            Neither the pre-sentence report, nor the district court's\n\ncolloquy    at   the    change   of    plea    hearing,   stated     a   specific\n\nsupervised release term.         The pre-sentence report indicated that\n\nthe court \"must impose a term of supervised release of at least\n\nfive (5) years\" and that the term of supervised release \"shall in\n\nno event be less than any statutorily required term.\"                    The pre-\n\nsentence report also stated that there was no basis for a departure\n\nfrom the Guidelines.          At the change of plea hearing, the judge\n\ninformed Cortes-Claudio of the sentence he could receive upon\n\npleading guilty, including \"a supervised release term of not less\n\nthan five years.\"\n\n            Later, at the sentencing hearing, following a discussion\n\nconcerning an error in the pre-sentence report regarding a prior\n\nconviction, the district court sentenced Cortes-Claudio to 151\n\nmonths imprisonment and ten years of supervised release.                  Cortes-\n\nClaudio did not object.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f              Following sentencing, however, Cortes-Claudio filed a\n\nmotion to correct his sentence.          Believing the district court had\n\nrelied upon a prior conviction to increase his term of supervised\n\nrelease from five years to ten years, Cortes-Claudio stated in his\n\nmotion that the district court had inadvertently imposed the ten-\n\nyear supervised release term required by § 841(b) for a defendant\n\nwith a prior conviction. He argued that because the government had\n\nfailed   to    file   an   information   pursuant   to   21   U.S.C.   §   851,\n\nindicating its intent to seek a higher sentence based on a prior\n\nconviction, the maximum allowable supervised release term was five\n\nyears.   18 U.S.C. § 3583(b)(1).\n\n              The district court denied Cortes-Claudio's motion to\n\ncorrect his sentence.         United States v. Cortes-Claudio, 152 F.\n\nSupp.2d 177, 178 (D.P.R. 2001).          The court stated that it had not\n\nrelied upon a prior conviction in setting Cortes-Claudio's term of\n\nsupervised release.        While the court recognized that 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3583(b) provided for a maximum term of supervised release of five\n\nyears for a Class A felony,1 it concluded that the supervised\n\nrelease provisions in § 841(b) trumped the maximums provided in §\n\n3583(b).      According to the court, the requirement in § 841(b) of\n\na minimum supervised release term of \"at least 5 years\" permitted\n\nthe court, in its discretion, to impose a supervised release term\n\n\n     1\n      Because the maximum term of incarceration authorized by law\nis life imprisonment, see § 841(b), Cortes-Claudio's offense is\ncategorized as a Class A felony. 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(1).\n\n                                     -5-\n\fof up to life.    Id. at 180.   The court stated that ten years was\n\nappropriate given the nature of Cortes-Claudio's offense.\n\n            According to the district court, in arriving at the ten-\n\nyear supervised release term, it considered all the relevant\n\nevidence and circumstances \"as well as the factors set forth in 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a)(2).\"    Id. at 180-81.    The district court stated\n\nthat both the terms of imprisonment and the supervised release term\n\nwere \"within the sentencing guidelines and appropriate considering\n\nthe nature of the offense.\" Id. at 181.\n\nII.         Discussion\n\nA.          Statutory Length of Supervised Release Terms\n\n            The first issue is whether the five-year maximum provided\n\nin 18 U.S.C. § 3583 is applicable as a limitation           upon the\n\nsupervised release term of Cortes-Claudio who was sentenced for\n\ndrug offenses pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 841(b).\n\n            We begin with a close look at the language of the two\n\nstatutes.   See Brady v. Credit Recovery Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759119\"><a href=\"/opinion/759119/william-h-brady-v-the-credit-recovery-company-inc-and-leslie-a-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 66 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).     Defendants convicted of conspiracy to commit drug\n\noffenses pursuant to 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a) and 846, are subject to\n\nthe penalties described in § 841(b).2     Pursuant to § 841(b)(1)(A),\n\n\n      2\n      Section 841(b)(1)(A) describes penalties for defendants, like\nCortes-Claudio, convicted of drug offenses, including conspiracy,\nsee § 846, involving a particular quantity of drugs. The statute\nrequires, in pertinent part, \"such person to be sentenced to a term\nof imprisonment which may not be less than 10 years or more than\nlife and if death or serious bodily injury results from the use of\nsuch substance shall be not less than 20 years or more than\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthe district court was required to sentence Cortes-Claudio to a\n\nterm of imprisonment which could not be less than \"10 years or more\n\nthan life\" and a term of supervised release of \"at least 5 years.\"\n\nWe have recently held that this language in § 841(b) establishes a\n\nmandatory minimum term of supervised release, not a maximum.\n\nUnited States v. Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200075\"><a href=\"/opinion/200075/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 90 (1st Cir. 2002).        Our\n\nholding in Lopez made clear that any apparent language to the\n\ncontrary in previous cases is limited to the specific facts of\n\nthose cases, and does not constitute precedent for the proposition\n\nthat language in drug statutes, such as 21 U.S.C. § 841, referring\n\nto \"at least 5 years\" (or some other term) sets out the maximum\n\nrather than a minimum only.   United States v. Barnes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199417\"><a href=\"/opinion/199417/united-states-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n261 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v.

Given the plain meaning of \"at least\" and our Lopez\n\nholding,   we do not regard Barnes and its companion cases as stare\n\ndecisis in regard to the present issue concerning the upper limit\n\nof a term of supervised release in a drug case.\n\n           We start, therefore, with the premise that the district\n\ncourt was plainly required by § 841(b) to sentence Cortes-Claudio\n\nto a minimum supervised release term of at least five years.     In\n\n\nlife . . . . Any sentence under this subparagraph shall, in the\nabsence of such prior conviction, impose a term of supervised\nrelease of at least five years in addition to such term of\nimprisonment and shall, if there was such a prior conviction,\nimpose a term of supervised release of at least 10 years . . . .\"\n\n                                 -7-\n\farguing that five years is also a maximum in respect to the\n\npermissible term of supervised relief, Cortes-Claudio would have us\n\nborrow from a different statute, § 3583(b), applying to federal\n\ncrimes generally.   Section 3583(b) specifies,\n\n          Except as otherwise provided, the authorized\n          terms of supervised release are --\n          (1) for a Class A or Class B felony, not more\n          than five years;\n          (2) for a Class C or Class D felony, not more\n          than three years; and\n          (3) for a Class E felony, or for misdemeanor\n          (other than a petty offense) not more than one\n          year.\n\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3583(b)(emphasis supplied). Because Cortes-Claudio was\n\nconvicted of a Class A felony, he argues that he is subject to a\n\nterm of supervised release of \"not more than five years.\"\n\n          The issue presented is whether § 841(b), which contains\n\nsentences applicable to specific drug offenses and conspiracy to\n\ncommit such offenses, under which Cortes-Claudio was sentenced,\n\ntakes precedence over the more general § 3583(b) in regard not only\n\nto the minimum five-year term expressly set forth in § 841(b) but\n\nalso to the unspecified lengthier terms implied if not specifically\n\nset forth in the \"at least\" phraseology.   We think it does.

When\n\nCongress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, it amended §\n\n3583(b) to add the phrase \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided\" at the\n\nsame time it included the supervised release terms set forth in §\n\n841(b) and maintained the words \"at least\" before the specified\n\nminimum term.

(100 Stat.) 3207-6.4\n\n               Defendants convicted of drug offenses have traditionally\n\nbeen       subject   to   sentences   different   from   those   imposed   upon\n\ndefendants convicted under other federal laws.

Prior to the creation of\n\nthe \"supervised release term\" to which defendants now must be\n\nsentenced,      defendants     generally   were   subject   to   a   period   of\n\n\"parole.\" As defendants were often released prior to serving their\n\nentire sentence, the length of a non-drug offender's parole was\n\nnormally dictated by how much time remained on his or her original\n\n\n       4\n      Our interpretation is also consistent with how courts\ninterpreted the statute prior to the adoption of the sentencing\nguidelines.    Specifically, Congress provided that a defendant\nsentenced under the prior version of § 841 be subject to \"at least\nfive years of special parole.\"          Courts interpreting this\nphraseology assumed that Congress provided a mandatory minimum term\nof special parole with a possible special parole term of life.\nSee, e.g., Fowler v.

Defendants convicted of drug offenses, however, were\n\nrequired to be sentenced by statute to a \"special parole term\" that\n\nwas distinct from their original sentence.             See id.

When Congress eliminated parole\n\nand instituted in its stead supervised release terms, it continued\n\nto treat drug offenders separately from other criminals in respect\n\nto supervised release, substituting \"supervised release term\" for\n\n\"special parole term\" in § 841(b) and providing specific directions\n\nrelative to those sentenced under that statute.

Section 841(b)(1)(A), the\n\nprovision under which Cortes-Claudio was sentenced, provides for a\n\nmandatory minimum term of at least five years of supervised release\n\nup to a maximum supervised release term of life.\n\nB.           Sentencing Guidelines and Supervised Release Terms\n\n             Even assuming that the court had statutory authority to\n\nimpose a ten-year term of supervised release, Cortes-Claudio argues\n\nthat the district court committed error when it sua sponte departed\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fupward from the supervised release term set forth in the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines.      See 18 U.S.C. §§ 3553(a) and 3553(b) (2000); U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 5K2 (2001).         According to Cortes-Claudio, the Guidelines, if not\n\nthe   statute     under    which    he   was    sentenced,    mandates     that   the\n\ndistrict court impose a term of five years supervised release. See\n\n§ 5D1.2.        Relying on § 5D1.2 of the Guidelines, Cortes-Claudio\n\ncontends that his ten-year supervised release term was an upward\n\ndeparture from the guideline range.                 If the court intended to\n\ndepart from the guideline sentence, Cortes-Claudio contends that it\n\nwas required to provide advance notice to the parties.                    See United\n\nStates v.

Section 5D1.2(a)(1) provides that if a term of\n\nsupervised release is ordered the length of the term for a Class A\n\nor B felony \"shall be at least three years but not more than five\n\nyears.\"    The term of supervised release imposed, however, cannot\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fdrop below the statutory minimum.         5D1.2(b).   Here, the guideline\n\nrange for supervised release was three to five years and the\n\nstatutorily required minimum sentence was five years.

The    defendant   could   not   have\n\nanticipated the district court's decision to impose a ten-year\n\nsupervised release term.
