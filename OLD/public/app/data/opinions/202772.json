Robert V. Rossi and Linda A. Rossi\n\n(\"the Rossis\") were named as respondents in a state court lien\n\nenforcement petition brought in May 2002 by Gem Plumbing & Heating\n\nCo., Inc. (\"Gem\").     In that proceeding, the Rossis raised a due\n\nprocess argument that the Rhode Island Mechanics' Lien Law, R.I.\n\nGen. Laws § 34-28-1 et seq., was unconstitutional.                         Although a\n\nstate Superior Court justice accepted the Rossis' argument, this\n\ndecision was vacated by the Rhode Island Supreme Court.                       See Gem\n\nPlumbing & Heating Co. v. Rossi, 867 A.2d 798, 800, 818 (R.I.\n\n2005).   Undaunted, the Rossis pursued § 1983 actions in federal\n\ncourt,   raising   similar   --       but    not     necessarily     identical     --\n\nconstitutional challenges.       The state court action remains pending\n\nin Superior Court, on remand from the Rhode Island Supreme Court.\n\n           The district court thought that the Rossis were simply\n\nre-litigating a battle they had already lost, and so it dismissed\n\nthe Rossis' claims on the bases, inter alia, of issue preclusion\n\nand the Rooker-Feldman doctrine.                 Before us, the parties spend\n\nconsiderable time and energy debating whether or not the Rhode\n\nIsland   Supreme     Court      has        already       rejected     the     Rossis'\n\nconstitutional     challenge.         We    do     not   decide     this    question.\n\nInstead, we conclude that Younger abstention is appropriate for the\n\nRossis' constitutional claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f                                              I.\n\n              The     facts      and     procedural          history     are     unusually\n\nconvoluted.          The   Rossis'       federal         complaint     alleged    that     in\n\nSeptember 2001, the Rossis had a conversation with Leonard P.\n\nGemma, Gem's president, regarding contracting work to be done at an\n\noffice building the Rossis owned in Smithfield, Rhode Island.1\n\nGemma had agreed to provide the Rossis with a written proposal\n\nbefore   he    engaged      in   any     actual       work,   but    then   his    company\n\nproceeded     to     perform     work    on     the      Rossis'   property      without    a\n\ncontract.\n\n               Gem sent the Rossis an invoice for $35,500, but the\n\nRossis refused to pay it.              On January 28, 2002, Robert J. Levine --\n\nan attorney for Gem -- signed and mailed to the Rossis a \"notice of\n\nintention\"      to    perform     work     on      the    Rossis'    building,     and     he\n\nsimultaneously filed a copy of this notice in the local land\n\nrecords.      This was done in order to perfect a mechanics' lien that\n\narguably had been created at the time Gem performed work at the\n\nRossis' property.          See R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-28-4 (2002);2 Gem, 867\n\nA.2d at 803.        Then, 120 days after Levine had mailed the notice of\n\nintention, Gem filed a petition to enforce its purported mechanics'\n\n\n     1\n       Robert Rossi is a self-employed attorney, and the Rossis\nintended that Robert would use the office building for his law\npractice.\n     2\n       Unless otherwise noted, all citations to the Rhode Island\nMechanics' Lien Law are to the version of the statute that existed\nas of January 2002.\n\n                                              -4-\n\flien in the Providence County Superior Court.           See R.I. Gen. Laws\n\n§ 34-28-10.    Gem sought to collect the full $35,500 it said it was\n\nowed.    The Rossis were named as respondents.\n\n            The Rossis concluded that Gem's enforcement action was\n\nencumbering their land and threatening the financing on their\n\nproperty.     One possible course of action for them would have been\n\nto simply contest the validity of Gem's lien, see id. § 34-28-20,\n\nbut this would have left their property encumbered until the\n\ncontest had been resolved. The Rossis instead chose another course\n\navailable to them under Rhode Island law -- they sought a \"lien\n\nsubstitution.\"     Utilizing this procedure, on June 4, 2002, the\n\nRossis paid $35,8603 into the registry of the Superior Court, and\n\nthe Superior Court granted the Rossis' motion to dissolve the\n\noriginal lien.     See id. § 34-28-17.\n\n            This   substitution   had    the   effect   of   leaving   nearly\n\n$36,000 of the Rossis' money in the court registry.           On August 29,\n\n2002, the Rossis filed a second motion in the Superior Court, this\n\none seeking both to dismiss Gem's enforcement petition and to\n\nsecure the release of their funds.       In support of their motion, the\n\nRossis advanced two claims.         First, they argued that because\n\nattorney Levine had signed the notice of intention, rather than\n\nGemma, the lien was invalid under state law.            Second, the Rossis\n\n\n     3\n       This amount reflected the full amount of Gem's claim, plus\ncosts incurred from the lien's enforcement.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fclaimed that the entire Mechanics' Lien Law was unconstitutional\n\nbecause it violated their due process rights under both the federal\n\nand Rhode Island constitutions.\n\n            After significant briefing and argument,4 the Superior\n\nCourt concluded that the Mechanics' Lien Law was unconstitutional\n\nunder both the state and federal constitutions.             To reach this\n\nconclusion, the court relied primarily on federal cases about\n\nprocedural due process.       See Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 U.S. 1\n\n(1991); Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976).                The court\n\nreasoned that the Mechanics' Lien Law deprived the Rossis of a\n\nsignificant property interest because it required them to pay the\n\nvalue of the lien into the court registry in order to avoid the\n\nnegative consequences that flowed from owning encumbered property.\n\nAdditionally,   the   Superior     Court   held   that   this   deprivation\n\noccurred without adequate procedural safeguards: Rhode Island's\n\nstatutory procedures did not do enough to promptly remedy erroneous\n\ndeprivations. On May 30, 2003, the Superior Court entered judgment\n\nin favor of the Rossis, dismissed the enforcement action against\n\nthem, and ordered the release of their funds from the court\n\nregistry.     The   court   then   temporarily    stayed   its    judgment,\n\npresumably to allow Gem the opportunity to appeal.              It does not\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       At the invitation of the Superior Court, the Attorney\nGeneral and various building and trade associations filed briefs in\nthe case.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fappear that the Superior Court ever addressed the Rossis' statutory\n\narguments for the lien's invalidity.\n\n           On June 5, 2003, Gem filed notice of appeal to the Rhode\n\nIsland Supreme Court.    Gem also asked the Rhode Island Supreme\n\nCourt for a longer stay, which that court granted pending further\n\norder.\n\n           The proceedings in the case attracted the attention of\n\nthe Rhode Island Legislature. On July 17, 2003, while Gem's appeal\n\nin the Rhode Island Supreme Court was pending, the legislature\n\namended its Mechanics' Lien Law by adding a new provision.     See\n\n2003 R.I. Pub. Laws 978 (codified at R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-28-17.1\n\n(2006)).   In pertinent part, the new provision declared:\n\n           (a)If any person in interest, including, but\n           not limited to, an owner or contractor claims:\n           . . . (2) [that] it appears from the notice of\n           intention that the claimant has no valid lien\n           by reason of the character of or the contract\n           for the labor, materials or equipment and for\n           which a lien is claimed; or (3) that a notice\n           or other instrument has not been filed or\n           recorded in accordance with the applicable\n           provisions of § 34-28-1 et seq.; or (4) that\n           for any other reason a claimed lien is invalid\n           by reason or [sic] failure to comply with the\n           provisions of § 34-28-1 et seq., then in such\n           event, such person may apply forthwith to the\n           superior court for the county where the land\n           lies for an order to show cause why the lien\n           in question is invalid, or otherwise void, or\n           the basis of the lien is without probability\n           of a judgment rendered in favor of the lienor.\n\nR.I. Gen Laws § 34-28-17.1 (2006). The legislature instructed that\n\nthe new provision would \"take effect upon passage, and [would]\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fapply to all pending mechanics' liens under Chapter 34-28,\" and\n\nthat the law would also apply to future liens, petitions, and lien\n\nsubstitutions.    2003 R.I. Pub. Laws 978, 979.\n\n           On September 16, 2003, the Rhode Island Supreme Court\n\ndirected   the   parties   to   include   in   their   appellate   briefs   a\n\ndiscussion of how the new statute affected the issues on appeal.\n\nThe parties complied.\n\n           On January 27, 2005, before the Rhode Island Supreme\n\nCourt had issued any decision, the Rossis filed a complaint against\n\nGemma and Levine in federal district court in Rhode Island.             The\n\nRossis brought two main claims.           First, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983, the Rossis asserted that Gemma and Levine had acted under\n\ncolor of state law to deprive the Rossis of their federally\n\nguaranteed rights to procedural due process.5 Federal jurisdiction\n\nwas alleged under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 for this claim.\n\nSecond, the Rossis invoked the court's supplemental jurisdiction,\n\nsee 28 U.S.C. § 1367, and asserted a state law claim for slander of\n\ntitle.   The complaint sought a variety of remedies: a declaration\n\nthat Rhode Island's Mechanics' Lien Law was unconstitutional, a\n\ndeclaration that Levine's signature was ineffective under state law\n\n(thereby rendering the lien void), an injunction restraining Levine\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       The Rossis also claimed that Gemma and Levine had violated\nsimilar guarantees in the Rhode Island Constitution.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fand Gemma from further depriving the Rossis of their money, and\n\ncompensatory and punitive damages.\n\n            On February 22, 2005, approximately one month after this\n\nfederal complaint had been filed, the Rhode Island Supreme Court\n\nissued its opinion in Gem and rejected the Rossis' constitutional\n\nchallenge.     Gem, 867 A.2d at 818.     The court first considered\n\nwhether it would analyze the constitutional issues with reference\n\nto the old Mechanics' Lien Law, or the amended statute, and it\n\ndecided that the amended statute was applicable.6   Id. at 802.   The\n\ncourt then proceeded to analyze the constitutional issues presented\n\nby the new statute in the context of the entire scheme set up by\n\nthe Rhode Island Mechanics' Lien Law.7\n\n\n\n     6\n         The court wrote:\n\n            Statutes are given retroactive effect only\n            when the legislature clearly expresses such an\n            application. Pion v. Bess Eaton Donuts Flour\n            Co., 637 A.2d 367, 371 (R.I. 1994).       [The\n            amended Mechanics' Lien Law] . . . clearly\n            [was] intend[ed] to apply . . . both\n            prospectively to future mechanics' liens and\n            retrospectively to pending mechanics' liens.\n            Based on the clear language of the statute and\n            our caselaw, we are required to apply the\n            [amended law] to this appeal.\n\nGem, 867 A.2d at 802 (footnote omitted).\n     7\n       The court stated that this was no easy task because the law,\n\"having its roots in various predecessor statutes going back to\n1847, has 'never been a model of clarity.'\" Gem, 867 A.2d at 802\n(quoting Faraone v. Faraone, 413 A.2d 90, 91 (R.I. 1980)); see also\nid. at 818 (urging the legislature to write a \"more plainly written\nand user-friendly statute\").\n\n                                 -9-\n\f               The court ultimately concluded that the statute, as\n\namended, passed constitutional muster.         It held that operation of\n\nthe Mechanics' Lien Law constituted state action, notwithstanding\n\nthe fact that private parties like Gem are the ones who invoke the\n\nlaw.       Id. 808-09.   It also agreed with the Rossis that Gem's use of\n\nthe Mechanics' Lien Law effected a deprivation of a significant\n\nproperty interest because it clouded the Rossis' title. See id. at\n\n809-10.       Nonetheless, the court found that the amended statute was\n\nconstitutionally sound.          It interpreted the amended statute to\n\nallow for a prompt hearing at any time after the notice of\n\nintention had been mailed -- a point in time that is usually before\n\nthe contractor obtains the right to sue to enforce the lien.         Id.\n\nat 811-12.       The court further interpreted the amended statute to\n\nrequire that this hearing \"be given priority on the Superior Court\n\ncalendar,\" and explained that at the hearing a property owner would\n\nhave the opportunity to challenge the claimed lien on a number of\n\ngrounds.       Id. at 812.   The court held that this prompt opportunity\n\nfor a hearing, when combined with the pre-existing procedural\n\nsafeguards in the statute,8 sufficed to insulate the statute from\n\nconstitutional attack.        See id. at 812-15, 818.\n\n\n       8\n       These other safeguards included the requirement that the\nnotice of intention be based on a sworn affidavit, see R.I. Gen.\nLaws § 34-28-4(b), the fact that the Superior Court could award\nlegal and other fees and expenses to the prevailing party in a lien\nenforcement action, see id. § 34-28-19, and the owner's opportunity\nfor a lien substitution, see id. § 34-28-17. See Gem, 867 A.2d at\n812-13.\n\n                                     -10-\n\f           The court also \"pause[d] to acknowledge an especially\n\npeculiar facet of this case.\"        Id. at 812.   It observed that while\n\nRhode Island case law \"clearly establishe[d]\" that the court had to\n\napply the amended lien law on appeal, the amended statute had not\n\nexisted at the time the Superior Court had ruled on the Rossis'\n\nmotion.   Id.    Despite this acknowledgment, the Gem opinion did not\n\nprovide further commentary on this procedural wrinkle -- the\n\nwrinkle that is the rub in this federal case.         Instead, the court\n\nvacated the Superior Court's judgment and remanded the case \"[f]or\n\nthe reasons stated herein and because the [Superior Court] did not\n\nhave an opportunity to review the Mechanics' Lien Law as amended.\"\n\nId. at 818.\n\n             The Rossis did not go back to the Superior Court to ask\n\nthat they be given the funds held in the registry.            Instead, on\n\nMarch 17, 2005, the Rossis amended their federal court complaint\n\nto add as a defendant Henry S. Kinch, Jr., the Clerk of the\n\nProvidence      County   Superior   Court.   Clerk   Kinch   was   named   a\n\ndefendant in his official capacity only, and the amended complaint\n\nasserted only a § 1983 due process claim against him.                  The\n\ncomplaint asked that Kinch be ordered to release the Rossis' funds\n\nto them (with interest), as the funds were still being held in the\n\nSuperior Court's registry.\n\n           Gemma, Levine, and Kinch all filled motions asking the\n\nfederal court to dismiss the lawsuit, or in the alternative to\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fabstain from exercising jurisdiction.             While those motions were\n\npending, on July 6, 2005, the Rossis filed a separate federal\n\ncomplaint naming Gem as the sole defendant.           This new lawsuit was\n\nfiled under a separate docket number, and assigned to the same\n\ndistrict court judge before whom the first federal lawsuit was\n\npending.\n\n           The new federal complaint alleged the same two primary\n\ncauses of action that the Rossis had brought against Gemma and\n\nLevine: a § 1983 claim based on procedural due process, and a state\n\nlaw slander of title claim.9     The Rossis sought the following forms\n\nof   relief:   a   declaration   that   the   unamended    version   of   the\n\nMechanics' Lien Law was unconstitutional, a declaration that Gem's\n\ncontinued use of the Mechanics' Lien Law violated the Rossis' due\n\nprocess rights, a declaration that Levine's signature rendered\n\nGem's lien void, an injunction to prevent Gem from depriving the\n\nRossis of the funds in the Superior Court's registry, an injunction\n\nrequiring Gem to cooperate with the Rossis in obtaining the release\n\nof their funds, and compensatory and punitive damages.\n\n           The motions to dismiss the Rossis' first federal lawsuit\n\nwere referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended that the suit\n\nbe   dismissed.      The   magistrate     judge    dealt   first   with   the\n\ndefendants' argument that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine barred the\n\n\n      9\n       As the Rossis did in their other federal complaint, they\nalso asserted their due process claim under the Rhode Island\nConstitution.\n\n                                   -12-\n\fRossis' § 1983 claim.    See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus.\n\nCorp., 544 U.S. 280, 284 (2005) (explaining that the Rooker-Feldman\n\ndoctrine precludes district court jurisdiction in \"cases brought by\n\nstate-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court\n\njudgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced\n\nand   inviting   district   court    review   and   rejection   of   those\n\njudgments\"); see also D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S.\n\n462 (1983); Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413 (1923).           Citing\n\nthe Supreme Court's recent opinion in Exxon Mobil, the magistrate\n\njudge agreed with Clerk Kinch that Rooker-Feldman barred the claim\n\nagainst him.     The judge pointed out that the Rossis did not sue\n\nKinch until after the Rhode Island Supreme Court had issued its\n\ndecision in Gem, and the judge further explained that because the\n\nRossis wanted Kinch to return the funds from the court registry,\n\nthey were seeking to undo a state court decision.          However, the\n\nmagistrate judge also concluded that Rooker-Feldman did not bar the\n\nclaims against Gemma and Levine: since the Rossis had sued them\n\nbefore the Gem opinion issued, the Rossis had not been \"state-court\n\nlosers\" at the time suit was filed.\n\n           The magistrate judge nonetheless concluded that both\n\nclaim and issue preclusion barred the § 1983 claims against Gemma\n\nand Levine.10    As to claim preclusion, the magistrate judge found\n\n\n      10\n       In light of his disposition on the preclusion issues, the\nmagistrate judge did not reach the defendants' arguments that the\n§ 1983 claim failed because the defendants did not act under color\n\n                                    -13-\n\fthat the Rossis could have asserted their § 1983 claim as a\n\ncounterclaim in the lien enforcement proceeding.           Their failure to\n\ndo so, in the magistrate judge's view, meant that their claim was\n\nbarred.11         As to issue preclusion, the magistrate judge read the\n\nRhode Island Supreme Court's decision in Gem to have already\n\ndecided the constitutional claims that the Rossis were presenting\n\nin their § 1983 action.          Thus the magistrate judge held that issue\n\npreclusion provided an independent reason to bar the constitutional\n\nclaims against Gemma and Levine.12\n\n                  The magistrate judge next turned to the state law slander\n\nof title claim against Gemma and Levine, and he concluded that the\n\ncourt should abstain from deciding that claim under the doctrine of\n\nColorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, 424\n\nU.S. 800 (1976).          Additionally, the magistrate judge recommended\n\nthat        the    district   court   decline   to   exercise   supplemental\n\njurisdiction over this state law claim; the judge explained that he\n\n\nof state law, because there was no actual violation of a\nconstitutional right, or because the Rossis' had not shown an\nentitlement to compensable damages.\n       11\n        The magistrate judge also explained that while the\ndefendants in the first federal action (Gemma and Levine) were not\nparties to the state court action (which involved Gem), Gemma and\nLevine were in privity with Gem.\n       12\n       In dealing with both issue preclusion and claim preclusion,\nthe magistrate judge rejected the Rossis' argument that there had\nnot yet been a final judgment against them in state court. Even\nthough the Rhode Island Supreme Court had remanded the case, the\nmagistrate judge reasoned that the opinion in Gem was a final\njudgment on the merits as to the issues that it had resolved.\n\n                                       -14-\n\fhad recommended dismissal of all federal claims, and that, under\n\nstate law, the slander of title claim was not yet ripe.\n\n          The Rossis objected to the magistrate judge's report and\n\nrecommendation, and the issues from the first federal lawsuit were\n\npresented to the district court.   The court adopted the magistrate\n\njudge's analysis and conclusion.      Simultaneously, the district\n\ncourt considered a motion for judgment on the pleadings that Gem\n\nhad filed in the second federal lawsuit.    The court concluded that\n\nthe arguments presented in the lawsuit against Gem were identical\n\nto the arguments presented in the lawsuit against Gemma and Levine,\n\nand it granted Gem's motion.\n\n          The Rossis appealed the district court's decision in both\n\ncases, and we consolidated the appeals.\n\n                                II.\n\n          The parties present to us essentially the same arguments\n\nthat they made in the district court.13    The defendants argue that\n\nthere are a number of reasons why the district court correctly\n\ndismissed the Rossis' claims, while the Rossis contend that each of\n\nthese arguments is in error.   Nearly all of the dispute surrounds\n\nthe dismissal of the Rossis' § 1983 claims.\n\n\n     13\n        Levine did not a file a brief in this court, and it is\nunclear if he continues to be a party to this appeal, and if so,\nwhether his intent is simply to rely on Gemma's brief. Gemma, for\nhis part, advances all of the same arguments he advanced in the\ndistrict court, with two exceptions -- he has apparently abandoned\nhis Rooker-Feldman argument, as well as his argument that the\ndefendants did not act under color of state law.\n\n                               -15-\n\f               We do not reach the merits of these arguments, and we\n\ninstead    conclude     that    abstention    is     the   appropriate   course.\n\nHowever, in order to understand our abstention analysis, it is\n\nimportant to understand the differing ways that the parties read\n\nthe Rhode Island Supreme Court's opinion in Gem.\n\n               The Rossis explicitly disavow any attempt to undo the\n\nstate court decision in Gem upholding the constitutionality of the\n\nMechanics' Lien Law. Rather, they believe that their § 1983 claims\n\nare targeted towards a narrow issue: the fact that the operation of\n\nthe Rhode Island statute deprived them of a prompt opportunity for\n\na hearing, notwithstanding the fact that the statute now provides\n\nsuch a hearing for others.           The Rossis read Gem as having decided\n\nonly a facial attack on the Mechanics' Lien Law.               They contend that\n\nwhen the Rhode Island Supreme Court remanded the case, it intended\n\nfor the Superior Court to decide any as-applied claims that the\n\nRossis might have.\n\n               The Rossis also point out that their § 1983 claims\n\ninclude a request for damages.          Thus even if one interpreted Gem as\n\ndeciding an as-applied constitutional challenge, the Rossis argue\n\nthat one could still read Gem's \"retrospectivity determination\" --\n\nits decision to evaluate the Rossis' constitutional claims with\n\nreference to the amended Mechanics' Lien Law -- as having been made\n\nsolely    in    the   context   of   the   Rossis'    motion    to   dismiss   the\n\nenforcement action against them. On this reading of Gem, the Rhode\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fIsland Supreme Court did not go so far as to hold that the new\n\nstatute eliminated a cause of action for any damages suffered from\n\nthe operation of the old statute.\n\n            The defendants appear to recognize that the Rhode Island\n\nSupreme Court never explicitly analyzed the constitutional issues\n\npresented by the unamended version of the statute.14                Nonetheless,\n\nthey    place   great    weight   on    the    Rhode   Island    Supreme   Court's\n\n\"retrospectivity determination.\"               In the defendants' view, the\n\nRossis are essentially trying to undo the Gem opinion because they\n\nwant the federal court to decide that the old version of the\n\nMechanics'      Lien    Law   applies   to     their   claims.     Additionally,\n\ndefendants Gem and Gemma reject even the Rossis' alternative\n\nreading in which their damages claim is preserved;15               Gem and Gemma\n\ncharacterize the Rhode Island Supreme Court as having said that the\n\namended statute \"now applies as if it was always in existence.\"\n\n            These differing readings shape many of the arguments that\n\nthe parties make on appeal.         Because the defendants think that the\n\nRhode Island Supreme Court has already rejected the Rossis' claims,\n\nthey assert that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine and issue preclusion\n\n(among other doctrines), bar the Rossis' § 1983 actions.                      And\n\n\n\n       14\n       Clerk Kinch, however, appears to argue that because the\nRhode Island Supreme Court vacated the Superior Court's decision,\nit necessarily rejected that court's constitutional analysis.\n       15\n       Only injunctive relief was sought against Clerk Kinch, and\nso the Rossis' claim for damages has no bearing on his arguments.\n\n                                        -17-\n\fbecause the Rossis read Gem differently, they think that their\n\n§ 1983 claims are viable.\n\n                                   III.\n\n             An appellate court may order abstention when the issue\n\nhas   been    raised   and   briefed    and   requested    by   the   federal\n\ndefendants, even though the issue was not addressed by the district\n\ncourt in the first instance.      See Ford Motor Co. v. Meredith Motor\n\nCo., 257 F.3d 67, 71 n.3 (1st Cir. 2001); cf. Swisher v. Brady, 438\n\nU.S. 204, 213 n.11 (1978) (declining to consider Younger abstention\n\nin a case where the defendants had not requested it).\n\n             Although there are a variety of abstention doctrines,\n\nthese doctrines \"are not rigid pigeonholes into which federal\n\ncourts must try to fit cases.\"         Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 481\n\nU.S. 1, 11 n.9; see also Rio Grande Cmty. Health Ctr., Inc., v.\n\nRullan, 397 F.3d 56, 68 (1st Cir. 2005).                  Nonetheless, \"the\n\ncategories do matter.\"       Rio Grande, 397 F.3d at 68.        We think that\n\nabstention is warranted under the rubric of Younger v. Harris, 401\n\nU.S. 37 (1971), for the Rossis' constitutional claims.\n\nA.           Younger Abstention on the Equitable Claims\n\n             Younger abstention is most commonly applied to suits\n\nseeking injunctive or declaratory relief, see Rio Grande, 397 F.3d\n\nat 70, and we begin with the Rossis' requests for these remedies.\n\n             The Younger doctrine is based on principles of comity,\n\nand unless there are extraordinary circumstances, it instructs\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\ffederal    courts      not   to    \"interfere     with    ongoing     state-court\n\nlitigation,      or,    in   some      cases,    with    state    administrative\n\nproceedings.\"     Maymó-Meléndez v. Álvarez-Ramírez, 364 F.3d 27, 31\n\n(1st Cir. 2004); see also Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden\n\nState Bar Ass'n, 457 U.S. 423, 431 (1982).               Although the doctrine\n\nis frequently associated with state criminal prosecutions, it has\n\nbeen extended to certain \"coercive\" civil cases.                      See Maymó-\n\nMeléndez, 364 F.3d at 31 & n.3.            Following Supreme Court case law,\n\nsee Middlesex County, 457 U.S. at 432, we have articulated the\n\nbasic analytical framework for Younger abstention.                  Abstention is\n\nappropriate when the requested relief would interfere (1) with an\n\nongoing state judicial proceeding; (2) that implicates an important\n\nstate interest; and (3) that provides an adequate opportunity for\n\nthe   federal    plaintiff        to   advance   his    federal   constitutional\n\nchallenge.    See Brooks v. N.H. Supreme Court, 80 F.3d 633, 638 (1st\n\nCir. 1996); Bettencourt v. Bd. of Registration in Med., 904 F.2d\n\n772, 777 (1st Cir. 1990).16\n\n           The      threshold      issue    of   \"interference\"      is   clearly\n\nsatisfied here.         Granting the Rossis' requests for injunctive\n\n\n\n      16\n       The Rossis briefly suggest that Younger is inapplicable here\nbecause the Rhode Island Mechanics' Lien Law is flagrantly\nunconstitutional. See Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, 611\n(1975) (recognizing an exception to Younger when a statute is\nflagrantly unconstitutional). We reject this argument out of hand.\nWhatever the merits of the Rossis' constitutional challenge, the\nRhode Island statute is not so obviously invalid as to come within\nthis very narrow Younger exception.\n\n                                         -19-\n\frelief would substantially interfere with the lien enforcement\n\nproceeding: if the Rossis obtain the return of their funds from the\n\ncourt registry, they will deprive the Superior Court of its ability\n\nto satisfy any claim that Gem may have against those funds.                 See\n\nRio Grande, 397 F.3d at 70 (\"Interference is . . . usually\n\nexpressed as a proceeding that either enjoins the state proceeding\n\nor has the 'practical effect' of doing so.\"); see also Keystone\n\nElevator Co., Inc. v. Johnson & Wales Univ., 850 A.2d 912, 923\n\n(R.I.   2004)    (explaining    that     once    there    has   been   a    lien\n\nsubstitution, the funds in the registry become the sole security\n\nfor the former-lienholder's claim).              Similarly, if the Rossis\n\nobtain their requested declaratory relief, and it is adjudged that\n\nthe old Mechanics' Lien Law is unconstitutional as applied to them,\n\nthey    will    essentially    have    obtained    a     judgment    that   the\n\ncontinuation of the state proceeding against them violates their\n\ndue process rights. This too is interference for Younger purposes.\n\nSee Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 72-73 (1971); Rio Grande 397\n\nF.3d at 70.\n\n           Turning to the three-part test for Younger, it is plain\n\nthat the first and third requirements are satisfied.                There is an\n\nongoing judicial proceeding, as the lien enforcement action remains\n\npending before the Superior Court.           And it is clear that the state\n\nproceeding provides an adequate forum for the Rossis to present\n\ntheir constitutional challenge.         Indeed, the Rossis raised a due\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fprocess challenge, had it at least partially adjudicated by the\n\nstate courts, and now actively contend that their as-applied\n\nchallenge is or will be pending before the Superior Court.17\n\n            That leaves the second Younger requirement, that \"an\n\nimportant state interest\" be implicated.       This requires slightly\n\nmore    discussion.   In   several   cases,   the   Supreme   Court   has\n\nrecognized that states \"have important interests in administering\n\ncertain aspects of their judicial systems.\"     Pennzoil, 481 U.S. at\n\n12-13; see also Middlesex County, 457 U.S. at 434-35 (state bar\n\ndisciplinary proceedings); Trainor v. Hernandez, 431 U.S. 434, 444\n\n(1977) (writ of attachment proceedings instituted by the state);\n\nJuidice v. Vail, 430 U.S. 327, 335 (1977) (state's process for\n\nenforcing its contempt judgments); Casa Marie, Inc. v. Superior\n\nCourt of P.R., 988 F.2d 252, 263 (1st Cir. 1993) (state's process\n\n\n       17\n        Even if the Rossis have not yet actually raised their as-\napplied constitutional claim in state court, a point we do not\ndecide, there has been no showing that state procedural rules\nprevent them from raising such a claim. See Maymó-Meléndez, 364\nF.3d at 33 (\"[W]hen a state judicial proceeding does occur, federal\njudges usually say that the parties ought to raise all of their\nclaims, defenses[,] and objections. . . . [I]f they don't, they\nshould not later come and complain to the federal courts.\"); see\nalso Duty Free Shop, Inc. v. Administracion de Terrenos de P.R.,\n889 F.2d 1181, 1183 (1st Cir. 1989) (explaining that for Younger\npurposes, all that matters is that the state proceeding give an\nopportunity to make a constitutional argument).\n     The Rossis do seem to suggest that the Rhode Island Supreme\nCourt's   rules   prevented   them   from  making   an   as-applied\nconstitutional argument to that court. But they have not shown\nthat the argument is unavailable to them on remand in the Superior\nCourt, and it is their burden to show unavailability in the state\nproceeding they wish to interfere with. See Pennzoil, 481 U.S. at\n14.\n\n                                -21-\n\ffor   enforcing      its   civil   judgments      through    the    use    of   civil\n\ncontempt).      State      proceedings      can   sometimes    implicate        these\n\ninterests even when the proceedings are initiated by private\n\nactors.      See     Bettencourt,    904    F.2d    at   777   n.6     (discussing\n\nPennzoil).\n\n           The Supreme Court's decision in Pennzoil is especially\n\ninstructive.       Pennzoil involved a breach of contract suit in the\n\nTexas state courts between two corporations, Pennzoil and Texaco.\n\n481 U.S. at 4.         Pennzoil won a large jury verdict, and if it\n\nrecorded this judgment in any Texas county, and followed certain\n\nother procedures, Texas law would have allowed it to enforce the\n\njudgment through forced sale of Texaco property.                       See id.      A\n\nseparate Texas rule provided that if Texaco wished to appeal the\n\ntrial   court   judgment,      the   only     way   Texaco     could      stave   off\n\nenforcement of the judgment during the appeal was if it posted a\n\nbond.   Id. at 4-5.        The bond amount would have been prohibitively\n\nlarge in that case.          Id. at 5.      But rather than challenge this\n\nprocedure in the Texas state courts, Texaco filed a § 1983 suit in\n\nfederal      court     claiming      that     the     Texas        procedure      was\n\nunconstitutional, and the company sought to enjoin Pennzoil from\n\nenforcing its judgment.        Id. at 6-7.        The Supreme Court held that\n\nYounger abstention was appropriate, and it decided that important\n\nstate interests were affected, even though the Texas procedures\n\nserved to vindicate the interests of private litigants. Id. at 10,\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\f12-13.     That was because the procedures stood \"in aid of the\n\nauthority of the judicial system, so that its orders and judgments\n\nare not rendered nugatory.\"      Id. at 13 (quoting Juidice, 430 U.S.\n\nat 336 n.12) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            This case, like Pennzoil, \"involve[s] challenges to the\n\nprocesses by which the State compels compliance with the judgments\n\nof its courts.\"   Id. at 13-14.    As in Pennzoil, a federal court is\n\nbeing asked not only to \"interfere with the execution of [a] state\n\njudgment[], but [to] do so on grounds that challenge the very\n\nprocess\" from which that judgment derives.            Id. at 14.   And just as\n\nPennzoil involved a bond meant to act as security for Pennzoil's\n\nanticipated final judgment, here the funds in the registry act as\n\nsecurity for Gem's anticipated successful claims.18\n\n            It is true, however, that this case differs from Pennzoil\n\nin that the Rossis attack a pre-judgment process, rather than a\n\npost-judgment process.       And the Third Circuit, anxious to find a\n\nlimiting   principle   for   Pennzoil,    has    speculated    that    \"in   an\n\nappropriate   case,\"   Younger    may    not    bar    interference   with    a\n\n\n\n     18\n       Pennzoil cannot be distinguished on the ground that Texaco\nhad never presented its constitutional argument to the state\ncourts, whereas here the Rossis may have presented the Rhode Island\ncourts with their constitutional challenge.     While the Pennzoil\ncourt did discuss this fact, it was not part of its explanation for\nwhy federal interference implicated an important state interest.\nSee 481 U.S. at 11-14; see also Kelm v. Hyatt, 44 F.3d 415, 420-21\n(6th Cir. 1995) (reading this aspect of Pennzoil as pertaining to\nwhether the state proceedings provided an adequate opportunity for\npresenting federal constitutional claims).\n\n                                   -23-\n\f\"privately initiated state proceeding in which the state court has\n\nnot yet rendered judgment.\"       Schall v. Joyce, 885 F.2d 101, 109 (3d\n\nCir. 1989).\n\n             Whatever the merits of the Third Circuit's concerns, this\n\nis   not    an   \"appropriate   case\"   to   prevent   Younger   abstention.\n\nInstead, this case presents special concerns because the state\n\ncourt proceeding, a petition to enforce a mechanics' lien, is an in\n\nrem proceeding under state law.              See Tilcon Gammino, Inc. v.\n\nCommercial Assocs., 570 A.2d 1102, 1107 (R.I. 1990).              Consistent\n\nwith the in rem nature of the proceeding, the Superior Court has\n\ntaken jurisdiction over a res, and the Rossis' funds are in the\n\ncourt's registry. It is well established that this provides strong\n\nreasons to defer to a state court proceeding.          See Colorado River,\n\n424 U.S. at 818; Donovan v. City of Dallas, 377 U.S. 408, 412\n\n(1964).19    Thus, we conclude that the Rossis seek to interfere with\n\na state proceeding in a way that implicates an important state\n\ninterest, and so the second test under Younger has been met.            Cf.\n\nKelm v. Hyatt, 44 F.3d 415, 419-20 (6th Cir. 1995) (applying\n\nYounger in a pre-judgment civil proceeding based on the unique\n\n\n\n\n      19\n       We note that the Rossis' constitutional challenge goes to\nthe very authority of the state court to administer the res, and it\nis not simply a request to adjudicate a claimed entitlement to a\nportion of the res. Cf. United States v. Fairway Capital Corp.,\n483 F.3d 34, 40-41 (1st Cir. 2007); Bergeron v. Estate of Loeb, 777\nF.2d 792, 798-99 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\n                                    -24-\n\fconcerns surrounding interference with a state's domestic relations\n\nlaw).\n\n          We find that Younger abstention is appropriate on the\n\nRossis' § 1983 claims for equitable relief. We affirm the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of the plaintiffs' constitutional claims insofar\n\nas they seek equitable relief.           See Bettencourt, 904 F.2d at 781.\n\nB.        Younger Abstention on the Damages Claims\n\n          The       Rossis'    claims    for   damages   present    a   somewhat\n\ndifferent concern.      Although the Supreme Court has not yet decided\n\nwhether Younger is applicable to § 1983 damages actions, see\n\nDeakins v. Monaghan, 484 U.S. 193, 202 (1988) (reserving the\n\nissue), our circuit has determined that Younger can in fact be\n\napplicable     to    damages    actions    in    appropriate   cases.       See\n\nBettencourt, 904 F.2d at 777; Landrigan v. City of Warwick, 628\n\nF.2d 736, 743 (1st Cir. 1980); Guerro v. Mulhearn, 498 F.2d 1249,\n\n1251, 1253-54 (1st Cir. 1974).           This is such a case.\n\n          We explained above that the three Younger requirements\n\nare met by the Rossis' equitable claims, and those requirements are\n\nmet by their damages claims for the same reasons.                  However, the\n\nthreshold Younger issue, that the requested relief interfere with\n\nan   ongoing    judicial       proceeding,      necessitates   slightly    more\n\ndiscussion in the damages context.\n\n          We have recognized that a § 1983 damages award may\n\ninterfere with a state proceeding because it can have the same\n\n\n                                        -25-\n\fpractical effect as a declaratory judgment: the federal court has\n\nproduced a ruling on the merits that the federal plaintiff can then\n\nuse to alter the state proceeding.         See Landrigan, 628 F.2d at 743;\n\naccord Deakins, 484 U.S. at 209 (White, J., concurring).                    That\n\nlogic applies to this case.       If the Rossis obtain a § 1983 damages\n\naward based on a successful due process argument, there is little\n\npractical difference than if they had obtained a declaratory\n\njudgment based on the same constitutional claim.\n\n               In   light   of   this,   we   think    that    abstention    is\n\nappropriate on the § 1983 damages claims, in addition to the\n\nabstention on the § 1983 equitable claims.            However, there is one\n\nimportant difference.       When a court orders abstention on a damages\n\nclaim, it ordinarily may only stay the action, rather than dismiss\n\nthe action in its entirety.       See Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,\n\n517 U.S. 706, 731 (1996).        Without addressing whether Quackenbush\n\ngoverns this case, we think that a stay is appropriate here.                Cf.\n\nDeakins, 484 U.S. at 202 (holding that a court cannot use Younger\n\nto dismiss a damages claim when the state proceeding cannot redress\n\nthe claims for monetary relief); Bettencourt, 904 F.2d at 781\n\n(suggesting that a stay is appropriate when the state proceeding\n\ndoes not actually involve a claim for damages).               Accordingly, we\n\nremand the case with instructions that the district court stay the\n\n§ 1983 damages actions pending the completion of state court\n\nproceedings.\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\f                               IV.\n\n          In addition to their federal constitutional claims, the\n\nRossis brought state law claims for slander of title against Gem,\n\nGemma, and Levine, and they also sought a declaration that Gem's\n\nlien was invalid under state law.20   The district court dismissed\n\nthese state law claims for two reasons: it thought that abstention\n\nwas appropriate under Colorado River, and it also exercised its\n\ndiscretion to decline supplemental jurisdiction.     See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1367(c).\n\n          Insofar as the Rossis sought a declaratory judgment that\n\nGem's lien was invalid under state law, we review the district\n\n\n     20\n        The magistrate judge treated the Rossis' request for\ndeclaratory relief as part of their slander of title claim, and the\nRossis appear to do so as well. We think it is more appropriate to\ntreat it as a separate claim for relief arising under state law.\nCf. Peckham v. Hirschfeld, 570 A.2d 663, 666-67 (R.I. 1990)\n(stating the elements for slander of title under state law). We\nnote that if we treated the claim as the magistrate judge did, it\nwould not change our analysis.\n     We also note that the Rossis have apparently abandoned, in\nfederal court, any claim for relief under the Rhode Island\nConstitution. Throughout their brief, the Rossis refer to their\nconstitutional claims as arising under § 1983, which of course only\napplies to the deprivation of rights guaranteed by federal law.\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Moreover, the Rossis' brief never cites the\nRhode Island constitutional provision that they relied on in their\ncomplaint. In fact, they identify their slander of title claim as\nthe only state law claim over which the district court should have\nexercised supplemental jurisdiction. In these circumstances, we\nbelieve that the Rossis have waived any argument that the district\ncourt erred in dismissing their state constitutional claims. See\nPlayboy Enters., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 906 F.2d 25, 40-41 (1st\nCir. 1990) (issues not raised in an appellant's opening brief are\nwaived); United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)\n(issues that lack developed argumentation in an appellant's brief\nare deemed waived).\n\n                               -27-\n\fcourt's dismissal for something akin to abuse of discretion.                     See\n\nWilton v. Seven Falls Co., 515 U.S. 277, 288-89 (1995) (explaining\n\nthat under the Declaratory Judgment Act, a district court has\n\ndiscretion whether or not to exercise jurisdiction).21 Importantly,\n\neven    though    the    district       court     concluded     that    there    were\n\n\"exceptional circumstances\" sufficient to justify abstention under\n\nColorado    River,      the   Supreme    Court     has   made   clear    that    when\n\ndeclaratory relief is sought under state law, the rigorous Colorado\n\nRiver test need not be met, and a much more lenient standard is\n\napplicable.      See id. at 287-88.\n\n            Here,    the      district    court    correctly     noted    that    the\n\nvalidity of Gem's lien is an issue that has been presented in the\n\nstate court proceedings.            It was within the district court's\n\ndiscretion to dismiss the claim for declaratory relief on this\n\n\n\n\n       21\n       Our cases have sometimes used slightly different terms to\ndescribe the appropriate standard of review for dismissal of a\ndeclaratory judgment action. In at least two post-Wilton cases, we\nhave simply said that review is for \"abuse of discretion.\" See\nHartford Fire Ins. Co. v. R.I. Pub. Transit Auth., 233 F.3d 127,\n130 (1st Cir. 2000); DeNovellis v. Shalala, 124 F.3d 298, 313 (1st\nCir. 1997). In another post-Wilton case, however, we said that\nreview \"'is conducted under a standard slightly more rigorous than\nabuse of discretion.'\" Diaz-Fonseca v. Puerto Rico, 451 F.3d 13,\n39 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v.\nProvidence & Worcester R.R. Co., 798 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir. 1986)).\nWe need not resolve any apparent inconsistency here, as under\neither articulation of the standard the district court acted well\nwithin its discretion.\n\n                                         -28-\n\fground.    See Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. of Am., 316 U.S. 491,\n\n494-96 (1942).22\n\n            That leaves only the state law damages claims against\n\nGem, Gemma, and Levine for slander of title.                   We bypass the\n\nColorado River analysis, and go straight to the district court's\n\ndeclination of supplemental jurisdiction.23            That declination is\n\nreviewed for abuse of discretion.          See Gonzalez-De Blasini v.\n\nFamily Dep't., 377 F.3d 81, 89 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            The Rossis contend that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion   because,   as   a   matter   of   state    law,    it   erred   in\n\nconcluding that the Rossis' slander of title claims were not yet\n\nripe.     But even assuming that the district court erred in its\n\nstate-law ripeness determination, it still acted appropriately in\n\ndeclining supplemental jurisdiction.\n\n\n     22\n       The Rossis point out that while Gem is a party to the state\ncourt lien enforcement petition, Levine and Gemma are not. Cf.\nBrillhart, 316 U.S. at 495 (\"Ordinarily it would be uneconomical as\nwell as vexatious for a federal court to proceed in a declaratory\njudgment suit where another suit is pending in a state court\npresenting the same issues, not governed by federal law, between\nthe same parties.\") (emphasis added).     Yet the Rossis have not\ndisputed the magistrate judge's finding that Gemma and Levine are\nin privity with Gem. In this situation, we cannot say that the\ndistrict court acted outside its discretion in declining to\nadjudicate the Rossis' claim for declaratory relief.       Cf. New\nBeckley Mining Corp. v. Int'l Union, 946 F.2d 1072, 1073 (4th Cir.\n1991) (explaining that suits can trigger Colorado River abstention\nwhen they involve \"substantially the same parties\"); LaDuke v.\nBurlington N. R.R. Co., 879 F.2d 1556, 1559 (7th Cir. 1989) (same).\n     23\n       Gem, Gemma, Levine, and the Rossis are all Rhode Island\ncitizens, so there is no argument that diversity jurisdiction could\nprovide an alternative basis for federal jurisdiction.\n\n                                   -29-\n\f              At the time the district court made its ruling, it had\n\ndismissed all federal claims on the pleadings, and so dismissal of\n\nthe   state    claims    was   perfectly   reasonable.    \"As   a   general\n\nprinciple, the unfavorable disposition of a plaintiff's federal\n\nclaims at the early stages of a suit . . . will trigger the\n\ndismissal without prejudice of any supplemental state-law claims.\"\n\nRodriguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp., 57 F.3d 1168, 1177 (1st Cir.\n\n1995); see also 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).\n\n              While we have dismissed the Rossis' federal claims for\n\nequitable relief, we have merely stayed their federal claims for\n\nmonetary relief.        But the distinction makes no difference for the\n\nslander of title claims; we do not believe that Congress meant to\n\npreclude the exercise of the district court's discretion to dismiss\n\nstate claims, this early in the litigation, once the court will not\n\ngo forward on any federal claims.          Cf. United Mine Workers of Am.\n\nv. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726-27 (1966).         That is particularly so in\n\nlight of the relative novelty of the state law claim.24             Cf. 28\n\n\n      24\n       The Rossis argue that it is clear under state law that Gem's\nlien is invalid because Levine was not competent to sign the\naffidavit which accompanied Gem's notice of intention. See Conti\nv. Geffroy, 486 A.2d 579, 581 (R.I. 1985). That may or may not be\ncorrect. But the Rossis' claim for relief is based on slander of\ntitle, a claim which requires a showing that \"the defendant\nmaliciously uttered false statements about the plaintiff's\nownership of real estate which resulted in the plaintiff sustaining\nan actual pecuniary loss.\" DeLeo v. Anthony A. Nunes, Inc., 546\nA.2d 1344, 1346 (R.I. 1988). The Rossis' theory is that because\nthe lien was invalid under the Mechanics' Lien Law, it was\ntherefore \"defamatory from the outset.\" It is not at all clear\nthat such a scenario is equivalent to the malicious uttering of\n\n                                    -30-\n\fU.S.C. § 1367(c)(1).    Accordingly, we sustain the district court's\n\ndismissal of the state law slander of title claims, although we\n\nclarify that this dismissal must be without prejudice.\n\n                                     V.\n\n           We make a further comment.          The sum of money at issue in\n\nthis lawsuit is surely not enough to have justified the extensive\n\nlitigation in federal court. Plaintiffs initially chose to present\n\ntheir federal claims to the state courts, and they may wish to\n\nconsider   whether   continuation    of    a    stayed   federal   action   is\n\nworthwhile.\n\n           The district court's judgment is affirmed insofar as it\n\ndismissed the Rossis' claims for injunctive and declaratory relief,\n\nvacated as to its dismissal of the Rossis' claims for monetary\n\nrelief, and remanded with instructions (1) to stay the Rossis'\n\n§ 1983 claims insofar as they seek monetary damages, and (2) to\n\ndismiss the state law slander of title claims without prejudice\n\ninsofar as those claims seek monetary relief. Each side shall bear\n\nits own costs.\n\n\n\n\nfalse statements.\n\n                                    -31-\n\f",

Rossi and Linda A. Rossi (\"the Rossis\") were named as respondents in a state court lien enforcement petition brought in May 2002 by Gem Plumbing &amp; Heating Co., Inc. (\"Gem\"). In that proceeding, the Rossis raised a due process argument that the Rhode Island Mechanics' Lien Law, R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 34-28-1 <i>et seq.,</i> was unconstitutional. Although a state Superior Court justice accepted the Rossis' argument, this decision was vacated by the Rhode Island Supreme Court. <i>See Gem Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. v. Rossi,</i> 867 A.2d 796, 800, 818 (R.I.2005). Undaunted, the Rossis pursued &#167; 1983 actions in federal court, raising similar &#8212; but not necessarily identical &#8212; constitutional challenges. The state court action remains pending in Superior Court, on remand from the Rhode Island Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court thought that the Rossis were simply re-litigating a battle they had already lost, and so it dismissed the Rossis' claims on the bases, inter alia, of issue preclusion and the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine. Before us, the parties spend considerable time and energy debating whether or not the Rhode Island Supreme Court has already rejected the Rossis' constitutional challenge. We do not decide this question. Instead, we conclude that <i>Younger</i> abstention is appropriate for the Rossis' constitutional claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts and procedural history are unusually convoluted. The Rossis' federal complaint alleged that in September 2001, the Rossis had a conversation with Leonard P. Gemma, Gem's president, regarding contracting work to be done at an office building the Rossis owned in Smithfield, Rhode Island.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Gemma had agreed to provide the Rossis with a written proposal before he engaged in any actual work, but then his company proceeded to perform work on the Rossis' property without a contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gem sent the Rossis an invoice for $35,500, but the Rossis refused to pay it. On January 28, 2002, Robert J. Levine &#8212; an attorney for Gem &#8212; signed and mailed to the Rossis a \"notice of intention\" to perform work on the Rossis' building, and he simultaneously filed a copy of this notice in the local land records. This was done in order to perfect a mechanics' lien that arguably had been created at the time Gem performed work at the Rossis' property. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 34-28-4 (2002);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Gem,</i> 867 A.2d at 803. Then, 120 days after Levine had mailed the notice of intention, Gem filed a petition to enforce its purported mechanics' lien in the Providence County Superior Court. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 34-28-10. Gem sought to collect the full $35,500 it said it was owed. The Rossis were named as respondents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rossis concluded that Gem's enforcement action was encumbering their land and threatening the financing on their property. One possible course of action for them would have been to simply contest the validity of Gem's lien, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 34-28-20, but this would have left their property encumbered until the contest had been resolved. The Rossis instead chose another course available to them under Rhode Island law &#8212; they sought a \"lien substitution.\" Utilizing this procedure, on June 4, 2002, the Rossis paid $35,860<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> into the registry of the Superior Court, and the Superior Court granted the Rossis' motion to dissolve the original lien. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 34-28-17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This substitution had the effect of leaving nearly $36,000 of the Rossis' money in the court registry. On August 29, 2002, the Rossis filed a second motion in the Superior Court, this one seeking both to dismiss Gem's enforcement petition and to secure the release of their funds. In support of their motion, the Rossis advanced two claims. First, they argued that because attorney Levine had signed the notice of intention, rather than Gemma, the lien was invalid under state law. Second, the Rossis claimed that the entire Mechanics' Lien Law was unconstitutional because it violated their due process rights under both the federal and Rhode Island constitutions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After significant briefing and argument,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the Superior Court concluded that the Mechanics' Lien Law was unconstitutional under both the state and federal constitutions. To reach this conclusion, the court relied primarily on federal cases about procedural due process. <i>See Connecticut v. Doehr,</i> 501 U.S. 1, 111 S.Ct. 2105, 115 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991); <i>Mathews v. Eldridge,</i> 424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). The court reasoned that the Mechanics' Lien Law deprived the Rossis of a significant property interest because it required them to pay the value of the lien into the court registry in order to avoid the negative consequences that flowed from owning encumbered property. Additionally, the Superior Court held that this deprivation occurred without adequate procedural safeguards: Rhode Island's statutory procedures did not do enough to promptly remedy erroneous deprivations. On May 30, 2003, the Superior Court entered judgment in favor of the Rossis, dismissed the enforcement action against them, and ordered the release of their funds from the court registry. The court then temporarily stayed its judgment, presumably to allow Gem the opportunity to appeal. It does not appear that the Superior Court ever addressed the Rossis' statutory arguments for the lien's invalidity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 5, 2003, Gem filed notice of appeal to the Rhode Island Supreme Court. Gem also asked the Rhode Island Supreme Court for a longer stay, which that court granted pending further order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proceedings in the case attracted the attention of the Rhode Island Legislature. On July 17, 2003, while Gem's appeal in the Rhode Island Supreme Court was pending, the legislature amended its Mechanics' Lien Law by adding a new provision. <i>See</i> 2003 R.I. Pub. Laws 978 (codified at R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 34-28-17.1 (2006)). In pertinent part, the new provision declared:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a)If any person in interest, including, but not limited to, an owner or contractor claims: . . .

Gen Laws &#167; 34-28-17.1 (2006). The legislature instructed that the new provision would \"take effect upon passage, and [would] apply to all pending mechanics' liens under Chapter 34-28,\" and that the law would also apply to future liens, petitions, and lien substitutions. 2003 R.I.

The Rossis brought two main claims. First, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, the Rossis asserted that Gemma and Levine had acted under color of state law to deprive the Rossis of their federally guaranteed rights to procedural due process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Federal jurisdiction was alleged under 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1331 and 1343 for this claim. Second, the Rossis invoked the court's supplemental jurisdiction, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367, and asserted a state law claim for slander of title. The complaint sought a variety of remedies: a declaration that Rhode Island's Mechanics' Lien Law was unconstitutional, a declaration that Levine's signature was ineffective under state law (thereby rendering the lien void), an injunction restraining Levine and Gemma from further depriving the Rossis of their money, and compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 22, 2005, approximately one month after this federal complaint had been filed, the Rhode Island Supreme Court issued its opinion in <i>Gem</i> and rejected the Rossis' constitutional challenge. <i>Gem,</i> 867 A.2d at 818. The court first considered whether it would analyze the constitutional issues with reference to the old Mechanics' Lien Law, or the amended statute, and it decided that the amended statute was applicable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Id.</i> at 802. The court then proceeded to analyze the constitutional issues presented by the new statute in the context of the entire scheme set up by the Rhode Island Mechanics' Lien Law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court ultimately concluded that the statute, as amended, passed constitutional muster. It held that operation of the Mechanics' Lien Law constituted state action, notwithstanding the fact that private parties like Gem are the ones who invoke the law. <i>Id.</i> 808-09. It also agreed with the Rossis that Gem's use of the Mechanics' Lien Law effected a deprivation of a significant property interest because it clouded the Rossis' title. <i>See id.</i> at 809-10. Nonetheless, the court found that the amended statute was constitutionally sound. It interpreted the amended statute to allow for a prompt hearing at any time after the notice of intention had been mailed &#8212; a point in time that is usually <i>before</i> the contractor obtains the right to sue to enforce the lien. <i>Id.</i> at 811-12. The court further interpreted the amended statute to require that this hearing \"be given priority on the Superior Court calendar,\" and explained that at the hearing a property owner would have the opportunity to challenge the claimed lien on a number of grounds. <i>Id.</i> at 812. The court held that this prompt opportunity for a hearing, when combined with the pre-existing procedural safeguards in the statute,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> sufficed to insulate the statute from constitutional attack. <i>See id.</i> at 812-15, 818.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also \"pause[d] to acknowledge an especially peculiar facet of this case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 812. It observed that while Rhode Island case law \"clearly establishe[d]\" that the court had to apply the amended lien law on appeal, the amended statute had not existed at the time the Superior Court had ruled on the Rossis' motion. <i>Id.</i> Despite this acknowledgment, the <i>Gem</i> opinion did not provide further commentary on this procedural wrinkle &#8212; the wrinkle that is the rub in this federal case. Instead, the court vacated the Superior Court's judgment and remanded the case \"[f]or the reasons stated herein and because the [Superior Court] did not have an opportunity to review the Mechanics' Lien Law as amended.\" <i>Id.</i> at 818.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rossis did not go back to the Superior Court to ask that they be given the funds held in the registry. Instead, on March 17, 2005, the Rossis amended their federal court complaint to add as a defendant Henry S. Kinch, Jr., the Clerk of the Providence County Superior Court. Clerk Kinch was named a defendant in his official capacity only, and the amended complaint asserted only a &#167; 1983 due process claim against him. The complaint asked that Kinch be ordered to release the Rossis' funds to them (with interest), as the funds were still being held in the Superior Court's registry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gemma, Levine, and Kinch all filed motions asking the federal court to dismiss the lawsuit, or in the alternative to abstain from exercising jurisdiction. While those motions were pending, on July 6, 2005, the Rossis filed a separate federal complaint naming Gem as the sole defendant. This new lawsuit was filed under a separate docket number, and assigned to the same district court judge before whom the first federal lawsuit was pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new federal complaint alleged the same two primary causes of action that the Rossis had brought against Gemma and Levine: a &#167; 1983 claim based on procedural due process, and a state law slander of title claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The Rossis sought the following forms of relief: a declaration that the unamended version of the Mechanics' Lien Law was unconstitutional, a declaration that Gem's continued use of the Mechanics' Lien Law violated the Rossis' due process rights, a declaration that Levine's signature rendered Gem's lien void, an injunction to prevent Gem from depriving the Rossis of the funds in the Superior Court's registry, an injunction requiring Gem to cooperate with the Rossis in obtaining the release of their funds, and compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motions to dismiss the Rossis' first federal lawsuit were referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended that the suit be dismissed. The magistrate judge dealt first with the defendants' argument that the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine barred the Rossis' &#167; 1983 claim. <i>See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp.,</i> 544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005) (explaining that the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine precludes district court jurisdiction in \"cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments\"); <i>see also D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman,</i> 460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <i>Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co.,</i> 263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). Citing the Supreme Court's recent opinion in <i>Exxon Mobil,</i> the magistrate judge agreed with Clerk Kinch that <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> barred the claim against him. The judge pointed out that the Rossis did not sue Kinch until after the Rhode Island Supreme Court had issued its decision in <i>Gem,</i> and the judge further explained that because the Rossis wanted Kinch to return the funds from the court registry, they were seeking to undo a state court decision. However, the magistrate judge also concluded that <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> did not bar the claims against Gemma and Levine: since the Rossis had sued them before the <i>Gem</i> opinion issued, the Rossis had not been \"state-court losers\" at the time suit was filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge nonetheless concluded that both claim and issue preclusion barred the &#167; 1983 claims against Gemma and Levine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> As to claim preclusion, the magistrate judge found that the Rossis could have asserted their &#167; 1983 claim as a counterclaim in the lien enforcement proceeding. Their failure to do so, in the magistrate judge's view, meant that their claim was barred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> As to issue preclusion, the magistrate judge read the Rhode Island Supreme Court's decision in <i>Gem</i> to have already decided the constitutional claims that the Rossis were presenting in their &#167; 1983 action. Thus the magistrate judge held that issue preclusion provided an independent reason to bar the constitutional claims against Gemma and Levine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge next turned to the state law slander of title claim against Gemma and Levine, and he concluded that the court should abstain from deciding that claim under the doctrine of <i>Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States,</i> 424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976). Additionally, the magistrate judge recommended that the district court decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over this state law claim; the judge explained that he had recommended dismissal of all federal claims, and that, under state law, the slander of title claim was not yet ripe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rossis objected to the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, and the issues from the first federal lawsuit were presented to the district court. The court adopted the magistrate judge's analysis and conclusion. Simultaneously, the district court considered a motion for judgment on the pleadings that Gem had filed in the second federal lawsuit. The court concluded that the arguments presented in the lawsuit against Gem were identical to the arguments presented in the lawsuit against Gemma and Levine, and it granted Gem's motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rossis appealed the district court's decision in both cases, and we consolidated the appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties present to us essentially the same arguments that they made in the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> The defendants argue that there are a number of reasons why the district court correctly dismissed the Rossis' claims, while the Rossis contend that each of these arguments is in error. Nearly all of the dispute surrounds the dismissal of the Rossis' &#167; 1983 claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not reach the merits of these arguments, and we instead conclude that abstention is the appropriate course. However, in order to understand our abstention analysis, it is important to understand the differing ways that the parties read the Rhode Island Supreme Court's opinion in <i>Gem.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rossis explicitly disavow any attempt to undo the state court decision in <i>Gem</i> upholding the constitutionality of the Mechanics' Lien Law. Rather, they believe that their &#167; 1983 claims are targeted towards a narrow issue: the fact that the operation of the Rhode Island statute deprived <i>them</i> of a prompt opportunity for a hearing, notwithstanding the fact that the statute <i>now</i> provides such a hearing for others. The Rossis read <i>Gem</i> as having decided only a facial attack on the Mechanics' Lien Law. They contend that when the Rhode Island Supreme Court remanded the case, it intended for the Superior Court to decide any as-applied claims that the Rossis might have.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rossis also point out that their &#167; 1983 claims include a request for damages. Thus even if one interpreted <i>Gem</i> as deciding an as-applied constitutional challenge, the Rossis argue that one could still read <i>Gem's</i> \"retrospectivity determination\" &#8212; its decision to evaluate the Rossis' constitutional claims with reference to the <i>amended</i> Mechanics' Lien Law &#8212; as having been made solely in the context of the Rossis' motion to dismiss the enforcement action against them. On this reading of <i>Gem,</i> the Rhode Island Supreme Court did not go so far as to hold that the new statute eliminated a cause of action for any <i>damages</i> suffered from the operation of the old statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants appear to recognize that the Rhode Island Supreme Court never explicitly analyzed the constitutional issues presented by the unamended version of the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Nonetheless, they place great weight on the Rhode Island Supreme Court's \"retrospectivity determination.\" In the defendants' view, the Rossis are essentially trying to undo the <i>Gem</i> opinion because they want the federal court to decide that the <i>old</i> version of the Mechanics' Lien Law applies to their claims. Additionally, defendants Gem and Gemma reject even the Rossis' alternative reading in which their damages claim is preserved;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Gem and Gemma characterize the Rhode Island Supreme Court as having said that the amended statute \"now applies as if it was always in existence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These differing readings shape many of the arguments that the parties make on appeal. Because the defendants think that the Rhode Island Supreme Court has already rejected the Rossis' claims, they assert that the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine and issue preclusion (among other doctrines), bar the Rossis' &#167; 1983 actions. And because the Rossis read <i>Gem</i> differently, they think that their &#167; 1983 claims are viable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An appellate court may order abstention when the issue has been raised and briefed and requested by the federal defendants, even though the issue was not addressed by the district court in the first instance. <i>See Ford Motor Co. v. Meredith Motor Co.,</i> 257 F.3d 67, 71 n. 3 (1st Cir. 2001); <i>cf. Swisher v. Brady,</i> 438 U.S. 204, 213 n. 11, 98 S.Ct. 2699, 57 L.Ed.2d 705 (1978) (declining to consider <i>Younger</i> abstention in a case where the defendants had not requested it).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although there are a variety of abstention doctrines, these doctrines \"are not rigid pigeonholes into which federal courts must try to fit cases.\" <i>Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc.,</i> 481 U.S. 1, 11 n.9, 107 S.Ct. 1519, 95 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987); <i>see also Rio Grande Cmty. Health Ctr., Inc., v. Rullan,</i> 397 F.3d 56, 68 (1st Cir.2005). Nonetheless, \"the categories do matter.\" <i>Rio Grande,</i> 397 F.3d at 68. We think that abstention is warranted under the rubric of <i>Younger v. Harris,</i> 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), for the Rossis' constitutional claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Younger <i>Abstention on the Equitable Claims</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Younger</i> abstention is most commonly applied to suits seeking injunctive or declaratory relief, <i>see Rio Grande,</i> 397 F.3d at 70, and we begin with the Rossis' requests for these remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Younger</i> doctrine is based on principles of comity, and unless there are extraordinary circumstances, it instructs federal courts not to \"interfere with ongoing state-court litigation, or, in some cases, with state administrative proceedings.\" <i>Maym&#243;-Mel&#233;ndez v. &#193;lvarez-Ram&#237;rez,</i> 364 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass'n,</i> 457 U.S. 423, 431, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 73 L.Ed.2d 116 (1982). Although the doctrine is frequently associated with state criminal prosecutions, it has been extended to certain \"coercive\" civil cases. <i>See Maym&#243;-Mel&#233;ndez,</i> 364 F.3d at 31 &amp; n. 3. Following Supreme Court case law, <i>see Middlesex County,</i> 457 U.S. at 432, 102 S.Ct. 2515, we have articulated the basic analytical framework for <i>Younger</i> abstention. Abstention is appropriate when the requested relief would interfere (1) with an ongoing state judicial proceeding; (2) that implicates an important state interest; and (3) that provides an adequate opportunity for the federal plaintiff to advance his federal constitutional challenge. <i>See Brooks v. N.H. Supreme Court,</i> 80 F.3d 633, 638 (1st Cir. 1996); <i>Bettencourt v. Bd. of Registration in Med.,</i> 904 F.2d 772, 777 (1st Cir.1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The threshold issue of \"interference\" is clearly satisfied here. Granting the Rossis' requests for injunctive relief would substantially interfere with the lien enforcement proceeding: if the Rossis obtain the return of their funds from the court registry, they will deprive the Superior Court of its ability to satisfy any claim that Gem may have against those funds. <i>See Rio Grande,</i> 397 F.3d at 70 (\"Interference is . . . usually expressed as a proceeding that either enjoins the state proceeding or has the `practical effect' of doing so.\"); <i>see also Keystone Elevator Co., Inc. v. Johnson &amp; Wales Univ.,</i> 850 A.2d 912, 923 (R.I.2004) (explaining that once there has been a lien substitution, the funds in the registry become the sole security for the former-lienholder's claim). Similarly, if the Rossis obtain their requested declaratory relief, and it is adjudged that the old Mechanics' Lien Law is unconstitutional as applied to them, they will essentially have obtained a judgment that the continuation of the state proceeding against them violates their due process rights. This too is interference for <i>Younger</i> purposes. <i>See Samuels v. Mackell,</i> 401 U.S. 66, 72-73, 91 S.Ct. 764, 27 L.Ed.2d 688 (1971); <i>Rio Grande</i> 397 F.3d at 70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the three-part test for <i>Younger,</i> it is plain that the first and third requirements are satisfied. There is an ongoing judicial proceeding, as the lien enforcement action remains pending before the Superior Court. And it is clear that the state proceeding provides an adequate forum for the Rossis to present their constitutional challenge. Indeed, the Rossis raised a due process challenge, had it at least partially adjudicated by the state courts, and now actively contend that their as-applied challenge is or will be pending before the Superior Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That leaves the second <i>Younger</i> requirement, that \"an important state interest\" be implicated. This requires slightly more discussion. In several cases, the Supreme Court has recognized that states \"have important interests in administering certain aspects of their judicial systems.\" <i>Pennzoil,</i> 481 U.S. at 12-13, 107 S.Ct. 1519; <i>see also Middlesex County,</i> 457 U.S. at 434-35, 102 S.Ct. 2515 (state bar disciplinary proceedings); <i>Trainor v. Hernandez,</i> 431 U.S. 434, 444, 97 S.Ct. 1911, 52 L.Ed.2d 486 (1977) (writ of attachment proceedings instituted by the state); <i>Juidice v. Vail,</i> 430 U.S. 327, 335, 97 S.Ct. 1211, 51 L.Ed.2d 376 (1977) (state's process for enforcing its contempt judgments); <i>Casa Marie, Inc. v. Superior Court of P.R.,</i> 988 F.2d 252, 263 (1st Cir.1993) (state's process for enforcing its civil judgments through the use of civil contempt). State proceedings can sometimes implicate these interests even when the proceedings are initiated by private actors. <i>See Bettencourt,</i> 904 F.2d at 777 n. 6 (discussing <i>Pennzoil</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court's decision in <i>Pennzoil</i> is especially instructive. <i>Pennzoil</i> involved a breach of contract suit in the Texas state courts between two corporations, Pennzoil and Texaco. 481 U.S. at 4, 107 S.Ct. 1519. Pennzoil won a large jury verdict, and if it recorded this judgment in any Texas county, and followed certain other procedures, Texas law would have allowed it to enforce the judgment through forced sale of Texaco property. <i>See id.</i> A separate Texas rule provided that if Texaco wished to appeal the trial court judgment, the only way Texaco could stave off enforcement of the judgment during the appeal was if it posted a bond. <i>Id.</i> at 4-5, 107 S.Ct. 1519. The bond amount would have been prohibitively large in that case. <i>Id.</i> at 5, 107 S.Ct. 1519. But rather than challenge this procedure in the Texas state courts, Texaco filed a &#167; 1983 suit in federal court claiming that the Texas procedure was unconstitutional, and the company sought to enjoin Pennzoil from enforcing its judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 6-7, 107 S.Ct. 1519. The Supreme Court held that <i>Younger</i> abstention was appropriate, and it decided that important state interests were affected, even though the Texas procedures served to vindicate the interests of private litigants. <i>Id.</i> at 10, 12-13, 107 S.Ct. 1519. That was because the procedures stood \"in aid of the authority of the judicial system, so that its orders and judgments are not rendered nugatory.\" <i>Id.</i> at 13, 107 S.Ct. 1519 (quoting <i>Juidice,</i> 430 U.S. at 336 n. 12, 97 S.Ct. 1211) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case, like <i>Pennzoil,</i> \"involve[s] challenges to the processes by which the State compels compliance with the judgments of its courts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 13-14, 107 S.Ct. 1519. As in <i>Pennzoil,</i> a federal court is being asked not only to \"interfere with the execution of [a] state judgment[], but [to] do so on grounds that challenge the very process\" from which that judgment derives. <i>Id.</i> at 14, 107 S.Ct. 1519. And just as <i>Pennzoil</i> involved a bond meant to act as security for Pennzoil's anticipated final judgment, here the funds in the registry act as security for Gem's anticipated successful claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, however, that this case differs from <i>Pennzoil</i> in that the Rossis attack a pre-judgment process, rather than a post-judgment process. And the Third Circuit, anxious to find a limiting principle for <i>Pennzoil,</i> has speculated that \"in an appropriate case,\" <i>Younger</i> may not bar interference with a \"privately initiated state proceeding in which the state court has not yet rendered judgment.\" <i>Schall v. Joyce,</i> 885 F.2d 101, 109 (3d Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the merits of the Third Circuit's concerns, this is not an \"appropriate case\" to prevent <i>Younger</i> abstention. Instead, this case presents special concerns because the state court proceeding, a petition to enforce a mechanics' lien, is an <i>in rem</i> proceeding under state law. <i>See Tilcon Gammino, Inc. v. Commercial Assocs.,</i> 570 A.2d 1102, 1107 (R.I.1990). Consistent with the <i>in rem</i> nature of the proceeding, the Superior Court has taken jurisdiction over a res, and the Rossis' funds are in the court's registry. It is well established that this provides strong reasons to defer to a state court proceeding. <i>See Colorado River,</i> 424 U.S. at 818, 96 S.Ct. 1236; <i>Donovan v. City of Dallas,</i> 377 U.S. 408, 412, 84 S.Ct. 1579, 12 L.Ed.2d 409 (1964).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> Thus, we conclude that the Rossis seek to interfere with a state proceeding in a way that implicates an important state interest, and so the second test under <i>Younger</i> has been met. <i>Cf. Kelm v. Hyatt,</i> 44 F.3d 415, 419-20 (6th Cir.1995) (applying <i>Younger</i> in a pre-judgment civil proceeding based on the unique concerns surrounding interference with a state's domestic relations law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that <i>Younger</i> abstention is appropriate on the Rossis' &#167; 1983 claims for equitable relief. We affirm the district court's dismissal of the plaintiffs' constitutional claims insofar as they seek equitable relief. <i>See Bettencourt,</i> 904 F.2d at 781.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Younger <i>Abstention on the Damages Claims</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rossis' claims for damages present a somewhat different concern. Although the Supreme Court has not yet decided whether <i>Younger</i> is applicable to &#167; 1983 damages actions, <i>see Deakins v. Monaghan,</i> 484 U.S. 193, 202, 108 S.Ct. 523, 98 L.Ed.2d 529 (1988) (reserving the issue), our circuit has determined that <i>Younger</i> can in fact be applicable to damages actions in appropriate cases. <i>See Bettencourt,</i> 904 F.2d at 777; <i>Landrigan v. City of Warwick,</i> 628 F.2d 736, 743 (1st Cir.1980); <i>Guerro v. Mulhearn,</i> 498 F.2d 1249, 1251, 1253-54 (1st Cir.1974). This is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We explained above that the three <i>Younger</i> requirements are met by the Rossis' equitable claims, and those requirements are met by their damages claims for the same reasons. However, the threshold <i>Younger</i> issue, that the requested relief <i>interfere</i> with an ongoing judicial proceeding, necessitates slightly more discussion in the damages context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recognized that a &#167; 1983 damages award may interfere with a state proceeding because it can have the same practical effect as a declaratory judgment: the federal court has produced a ruling on the merits that the federal plaintiff can then use to alter the state proceeding. <i>See Landrigan,</i> 628 F.2d at 743; <i>accord Deakins,</i> 484 U.S. at 209, 108 S.Ct. 523 (White, J., concurring). That logic applies to this case. If the Rossis obtain a &#167; 1983 damages award based on a successful due process argument, there is little practical difference than if they had obtained a declaratory judgment based on the same constitutional claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of this, we think that abstention is appropriate on the &#167; 1983 damages claims, in addition to the abstention on the &#167; 1983 equitable claims. However, there is one important difference. When a court orders abstention on a damages claim, it ordinarily may only stay the action, rather than dismiss the action in its entirety. <i>See Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> 517 U.S. 706, 731, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996). Without addressing whether <i>Quackenbush</i> governs this case, we think that a stay is appropriate here. <i>Cf. Deakins,</i> 484 U.S. at 202, 108 S.Ct. 523 (holding that a court cannot use <i>Younger</i> to dismiss a damages claim when the state proceeding cannot redress the claims for monetary relief); <i>Bettencourt,</i> 904 F.2d at 781 (suggesting that a stay is appropriate when the state proceeding does not actually involve a claim for damages). Accordingly, we remand the case with instructions that the district court stay the &#167; 1983 damages actions pending the completion of state court proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to their federal constitutional claims, the Rossis brought state law claims for slander of title against Gem, Gemma, and Levine, and they also sought a declaration that Gem's lien was invalid under state law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> The district court dismissed these state law claims for two reasons: it thought that abstention was appropriate under <i>Colorado River,</i> and it also exercised its discretion to decline supplemental jurisdiction. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as the Rossis sought a declaratory judgment that Gem's lien was invalid under state law, we review the district court's dismissal for something akin to abuse of discretion. <i>See Wilton v. Seven Falls Co.,</i> 515 U.S. 277, 288-89, 115 S.Ct. 2137, 132 L.Ed.2d 214 (1995) (explaining that under the Declaratory Judgment Act, a district court has discretion whether or not to exercise jurisdiction).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> Importantly, even though the district court concluded that there were \"exceptional circumstances\" sufficient to justify abstention under <i>Colorado River,</i> the Supreme Court has made clear that when declaratory relief is sought under state law, the rigorous <i>Colorado River</i> test need not be met, and a much more lenient standard is applicable. <i>See id.</i> at 287-88, 115 S.Ct. 2137.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court correctly noted that the validity of Gem's lien is an issue that has been presented in the state court proceedings. It was within the district court's discretion to dismiss the claim for declaratory relief on this ground. <i>See Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> 316 U.S. 491, 494-96, 62 S.Ct. 1173, 86 L.Ed. 1620 (1942).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That leaves only the state law damages claims against Gem, Gemma, and Levine for slander of title. We bypass the <i>Colorado River</i> analysis, and go straight to the district court's declination of supplemental jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> That declination is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>See Gonzalez-De Blasini v. Family Dep't,</i> 377 F.3d 81, 89 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rossis contend that the district court abused its discretion because, as a matter of state law, it erred in concluding that the Rossis' slander of title claims were not yet ripe. But even assuming that the district court erred in its state-law ripeness determination, it still acted appropriately in declining supplemental jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time the district court made its ruling, it had dismissed all federal claims on the pleadings, and so dismissal of the state claims was perfectly reasonable. \"As a general principle, the unfavorable disposition of a plaintiff's federal claims at the early stages of a suit . . . will trigger the dismissal without prejudice of any supplemental state-law claims.\" <i>Rodriguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp.,</i> 57 F.3d 1168, 1177 (1st Cir.1995); <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we have dismissed the Rossis' federal claims for equitable relief, we have merely stayed their federal claims for monetary relief. But the distinction makes no difference for the slander of title claims; we do not believe that Congress meant to preclude the exercise of the district court's discretion to dismiss state claims, this early in the litigation, once the court will not go forward on any federal claims. <i>Cf. United Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs,</i> 383 U.S. 715, 726-27, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). That is particularly so in light of the relative novelty of the state law claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> <i>Cf.</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c)(1). Accordingly, we sustain the district court's dismissal of the state law slander of title claims, although we clarify that this dismissal must be without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We make a further comment. The sum of money at issue in this lawsuit is surely not enough to have justified the extensive litigation in federal court. Plaintiffs initially chose to present their federal claims to the state courts, and they may wish to consider whether continuation of a stayed federal action is worthwhile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's judgment is <i>affirmed</i> insofar as it dismissed the Rossis' claims for injunctive and declaratory relief, <i>vacated</i> as to its dismissal of the Rossis' claims for monetary relief, and <i>remanded</i> with instructions (1) to stay the Rossis' &#167; 1983 claims insofar as they seek monetary damages, and (2) to dismiss the state law slander of title claims <i>without prejudice</i> insofar as those claims seek monetary relief.

But they have not shown that the argument is unavailable to them on remand in the Superior Court, and it is their burden to show unavailability in the state proceeding they wish to interfere with. <i>See Pennzoil,</i> 481 U.S. at 14, 107 S.Ct. 1519.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> <i>Pennzoil</i> cannot be distinguished on the ground that Texaco had never presented its constitutional argument to the state courts, whereas here the Rossis may have presented the Rhode Island courts with their constitutional challenge. While the <i>Pennzoil</i> court did discuss this fact, it was not part of its explanation for why federal interference implicated an important state interest. <i>See</i> 481 U.S. at 11-14, 107 S.Ct. 1519; <i>see also Kelm v.

United States v. Fairway Capital Corp.,</i> 483 F.3d 34, 40-41 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Bergeron v. Estate of Loeb,</i> 777 F.2d 792, 798-99 (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> The magistrate judge treated the Rossis' request for declaratory relief as part of their slander of title claim, and the Rossis appear to do so as well. We think it is more appropriate to treat it as a separate claim for relief arising under state law<i>Cf. Peckham v. Hirschfeld,</i> 570 A.2d 663, 666-67 (R.I.1990) (stating the elements for slander of title under state law). We note that if we treated the claim as the magistrate judge did, it would not change our analysis.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We also note that the Rossis have apparently abandoned, in federal court, any claim for relief under the Rhode Island Constitution. Throughout their brief, the Rossis refer to their constitutional claims as arising under &#167; 1983, which of course only applies to the deprivation of rights guaranteed by federal law. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. Moreover, the Rossis' brief never cites the Rhode Island constitutional provision that they relied on in their complaint. In fact, they identify their slander of title claim as the only state law claim over which the district court should have exercised supplemental jurisdiction. In these circumstances, we believe that the Rossis have waived any argument that the district court erred in dismissing their state constitutional claims. <i>See Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n,</i> 906 F.2d 25, 40-41 (1st Cir.1990) (issues not raised in an appellant's opening brief are waived); <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (issues that lack developed argumentation in an appellant's brief are deemed waived).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> Our cases have sometimes used slightly different terms to describe the appropriate standard of review for dismissal of a declaratory judgment action. In at least two post-<i>Wilton</i> cases, we have simply said that review is for \"abuse of discretion.\" <i>See Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. R.I. Pub. Transit Auth.,</i> 233 F.3d 127, 130 (1st Cir.2000); <i>DeNovellis v. Shalala,</i> 124 F.3d 298, 313 (1st Cir.1997). In another post-<i>Wilton</i> case, however, we said that review \"`is conducted under a standard slightly more rigorous than abuse of discretion.'\" <i>Diaz-Fonseca v. Puerto Rico,</i> 451 F.3d 13, 39 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Providence &amp; Worcester R.R. Co.,</i> 798 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir.1986)). We need not resolve any apparent inconsistency here, as under either articulation of the standard the district court acted well within its discretion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> The Rossis point out that while Gem is a party to the state court lien enforcement petition, Levine and Gemma are not<i>Cf.

Yet the Rossis have not disputed the magistrate judge's finding that Gemma and Levine are in privity with Gem. In this situation, we cannot say that the district court acted outside its discretion in declining to adjudicate the Rossis' claim for declaratory relief. <i>Cf. New Beckley Mining Corp. v. Int'l Union,</i> 946 F.2d 1072, 1073 (4th Cir.1991) (explaining that suits can trigger <i>Colorado River</i> abstention when they involve \"substantially the same parties\"); <i>LaDuke v.

Geffroy,</i> 486 A.2d 579, 581 (R.I.1985). That may or may not be correct. But the Rossis' claim for relief is based on slander of title, a claim which requires a showing that \"the defendant maliciously uttered false statements about the plaintiff's ownership of real estate which resulted in the plaintiff sustaining an actual pecuniary loss.\" <i>DeLeo v. Anthony A. Nunes, Inc.,</i> 546 A.2d 1344, 1346 (R.I.1988). The Rossis' theory is that because the lien was invalid under the Mechanics' Lien Law, it was therefore \"defamatory from the outset.\" It is not at all clear that such a scenario is equivalent to the malicious uttering of false statements.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Rossi and Linda A. Rossi (\"the Rossis\") were named as respondents in a state court lien enforcement petition brought in May 2002 by Gem Plumbing &amp; Heating Co., Inc. (\"Gem\"). In that proceeding, the Rossis raised a due process argument that the Rhode Island Mechanics' Lien Law, R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 34-28-1 <i>et seq.,</i> was unconstitutional. Although a state Superior Court justice accepted the Rossis' argument, this decision was vacated by the Rhode Island Supreme Court. <i>See Gem Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. v. Rossi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1547605\"><a href=\"/opinion/1547605/gem-plumbing-heating-co-inc-v-rossi/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></a></span>, 800, 818 (R.I.2005). Undaunted, the Rossis pursued &#167; 1983 actions in federal court, raising similar &#8212; but not necessarily identical &#8212; constitutional challenges. The state court action remains pending in Superior Court, on remand from the Rhode Island Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court thought that the Rossis were simply re-litigating a battle they had already lost, and so it dismissed the Rossis' claims on the bases, inter alia, of issue preclusion and the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine. Before us, the parties spend considerable time and energy debating whether or not the Rhode Island Supreme Court has already rejected the Rossis' constitutional challenge. We do not decide this question. Instead, we conclude that <i>Younger</i> abstention is appropriate for the Rossis' constitutional claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts and procedural history are unusually convoluted. The Rossis' federal complaint alleged that in September 2001, the Rossis had a conversation with Leonard P. Gemma, Gem's president, regarding contracting work to be done at an office building the Rossis owned in Smithfield, Rhode Island.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Gemma had agreed to provide the Rossis with a written proposal before he engaged in any actual work, but then his company proceeded to perform work on the Rossis' property without a contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gem sent the Rossis an invoice for $35,500, but the Rossis refused to pay it. On January 28, 2002, Robert J. Levine &#8212; an attorney for Gem &#8212; signed and mailed to the Rossis a \"notice of intention\" to perform work on the Rossis' building, and he simultaneously filed a copy of this notice in the local land records. This was done in order to perfect a mechanics' lien that arguably had been created at the time Gem performed work at the Rossis' property. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 34-28-4 (2002);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Gem,</i> 867 A.2d at 803. Then, 120 days after Levine had mailed the notice of intention, Gem filed a petition to enforce its purported mechanics' lien in the Providence County Superior Court. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 34-28-10. Gem sought to collect the full $35,500 it said it was owed. The Rossis were named as respondents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rossis concluded that Gem's enforcement action was encumbering their land and threatening the financing on their property. One possible course of action for them would have been to simply contest the validity of Gem's lien, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 34-28-20, but this would have left their property encumbered until the contest had been resolved. The Rossis instead chose another course available to them under Rhode Island law &#8212; they sought a \"lien substitution.\" Utilizing this procedure, on June 4, 2002, the Rossis paid $35,860<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> into the registry of the Superior Court, and the Superior Court granted the Rossis' motion to dissolve the original lien. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 34-28-17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This substitution had the effect of leaving nearly $36,000 of the Rossis' money in the court registry. On August 29, 2002, the Rossis filed a second motion in the Superior Court, this one seeking both to dismiss Gem's enforcement petition and to secure the release of their funds. In support of their motion, the Rossis advanced two claims. First, they argued that because attorney Levine had signed the notice of intention, rather than Gemma, the lien was invalid under state law. Second, the Rossis claimed that the entire Mechanics' Lien Law was unconstitutional because it violated their due process rights under both the federal and Rhode Island constitutions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After significant briefing and argument,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the Superior Court concluded that the Mechanics' Lien Law was unconstitutional under both the state and federal constitutions. To reach this conclusion, the court relied primarily on federal cases about procedural due process. <i>See Connecticut v. Doehr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112615\"><a href=\"/opinion/112615/connecticut-v-doehr/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112615\"><a href=\"/opinion/112615/connecticut-v-doehr/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span> (1976). The court reasoned that the Mechanics' Lien Law deprived the Rossis of a significant property interest because it required them to pay the value of the lien into the court registry in order to avoid the negative consequences that flowed from owning encumbered property. Additionally, the Superior Court held that this deprivation occurred without adequate procedural safeguards: Rhode Island's statutory procedures did not do enough to promptly remedy erroneous deprivations. On May 30, 2003, the Superior Court entered judgment in favor of the Rossis, dismissed the enforcement action against them, and ordered the release of their funds from the court registry. The court then temporarily stayed its judgment, presumably to allow Gem the opportunity to appeal. It does not appear that the Superior Court ever addressed the Rossis' statutory arguments for the lien's invalidity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 5, 2003, Gem filed notice of appeal to the Rhode Island Supreme Court. Gem also asked the Rhode Island Supreme Court for a longer stay, which that court granted pending further order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proceedings in the case attracted the attention of the Rhode Island Legislature. On July 17, 2003, while Gem's appeal in the Rhode Island Supreme Court was pending, the legislature amended its Mechanics' Lien Law by adding a new provision. <i>See</i> 2003 R.I. Pub. Laws 978 (codified at R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 34-28-17.1 (2006)). In pertinent part, the new provision declared:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a)If any person in interest, including, but not limited to, an owner or contractor claims: . . .

Gen Laws &#167; 34-28-17.1 (2006). The legislature instructed that the new provision would \"take effect upon passage, and [would] apply to all pending mechanics' liens under Chapter 34-28,\" and that the law would also apply to future liens, petitions, and lien substitutions. 2003 R.I.

The parties complied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 27, 2005, before the Rhode Island Supreme Court had issued any decision, the Rossis filed a complaint against Gemma and Levine in federal district court in Rhode Island. The Rossis brought two main claims. First, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, the Rossis asserted that Gemma and Levine had acted under color of state law to deprive the Rossis of their federally guaranteed rights to procedural due process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Federal jurisdiction was alleged under 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1331 and 1343 for this claim. Second, the Rossis invoked the court's supplemental jurisdiction, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367, and asserted a state law claim for slander of title. The complaint sought a variety of remedies: a declaration that Rhode Island's Mechanics' Lien Law was unconstitutional, a declaration that Levine's signature was ineffective under state law (thereby rendering the lien void), an injunction restraining Levine and Gemma from further depriving the Rossis of their money, and compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 22, 2005, approximately one month after this federal complaint had been filed, the Rhode Island Supreme Court issued its opinion in <i>Gem</i> and rejected the Rossis' constitutional challenge. <i>Gem,</i> 867 A.2d at 818. The court first considered whether it would analyze the constitutional issues with reference to the old Mechanics' Lien Law, or the amended statute, and it decided that the amended statute was applicable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Id.</i> at 802. The court then proceeded to analyze the constitutional issues presented by the new statute in the context of the entire scheme set up by the Rhode Island Mechanics' Lien Law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court ultimately concluded that the statute, as amended, passed constitutional muster. It held that operation of the Mechanics' Lien Law constituted state action, notwithstanding the fact that private parties like Gem are the ones who invoke the law. <i>Id.</i> 808-09. It also agreed with the Rossis that Gem's use of the Mechanics' Lien Law effected a deprivation of a significant property interest because it clouded the Rossis' title. <i>See id.</i> at 809-10. Nonetheless, the court found that the amended statute was constitutionally sound. It interpreted the amended statute to allow for a prompt hearing at any time after the notice of intention had been mailed &#8212; a point in time that is usually <i>before</i> the contractor obtains the right to sue to enforce the lien. <i>Id.</i> at 811-12. The court further interpreted the amended statute to require that this hearing \"be given priority on the Superior Court calendar,\" and explained that at the hearing a property owner would have the opportunity to challenge the claimed lien on a number of grounds. <i>Id.</i> at 812. The court held that this prompt opportunity for a hearing, when combined with the pre-existing procedural safeguards in the statute,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> sufficed to insulate the statute from constitutional attack. <i>See id.</i> at 812-15, 818.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also \"pause[d] to acknowledge an especially peculiar facet of this case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 812. It observed that while Rhode Island case law \"clearly establishe[d]\" that the court had to apply the amended lien law on appeal, the amended statute had not existed at the time the Superior Court had ruled on the Rossis' motion. <i>Id.</i> Despite this acknowledgment, the <i>Gem</i> opinion did not provide further commentary on this procedural wrinkle &#8212; the wrinkle that is the rub in this federal case. Instead, the court vacated the Superior Court's judgment and remanded the case \"[f]or the reasons stated herein and because the [Superior Court] did not have an opportunity to review the Mechanics' Lien Law as amended.\" <i>Id.</i> at 818.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rossis did not go back to the Superior Court to ask that they be given the funds held in the registry. Instead, on March 17, 2005, the Rossis amended their federal court complaint to add as a defendant Henry S. Kinch, Jr., the Clerk of the Providence County Superior Court. Clerk Kinch was named a defendant in his official capacity only, and the amended complaint asserted only a &#167; 1983 due process claim against him. The complaint asked that Kinch be ordered to release the Rossis' funds to them (with interest), as the funds were still being held in the Superior Court's registry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gemma, Levine, and Kinch all filed motions asking the federal court to dismiss the lawsuit, or in the alternative to abstain from exercising jurisdiction. While those motions were pending, on July 6, 2005, the Rossis filed a separate federal complaint naming Gem as the sole defendant. This new lawsuit was filed under a separate docket number, and assigned to the same district court judge before whom the first federal lawsuit was pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new federal complaint alleged the same two primary causes of action that the Rossis had brought against Gemma and Levine: a &#167; 1983 claim based on procedural due process, and a state law slander of title claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The Rossis sought the following forms of relief: a declaration that the unamended version of the Mechanics' Lien Law was unconstitutional, a declaration that Gem's continued use of the Mechanics' Lien Law violated the Rossis' due process rights, a declaration that Levine's signature rendered Gem's lien void, an injunction to prevent Gem from depriving the Rossis of the funds in the Superior Court's registry, an injunction requiring Gem to cooperate with the Rossis in obtaining the release of their funds, and compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motions to dismiss the Rossis' first federal lawsuit were referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended that the suit be dismissed. The magistrate judge dealt first with the defendants' argument that the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine barred the Rossis' &#167; 1983 claim. <i>See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus.

Citing the Supreme Court's recent opinion in <i>Exxon Mobil,</i> the magistrate judge agreed with Clerk Kinch that <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> barred the claim against him. The judge pointed out that the Rossis did not sue Kinch until after the Rhode Island Supreme Court had issued its decision in <i>Gem,</i> and the judge further explained that because the Rossis wanted Kinch to return the funds from the court registry, they were seeking to undo a state court decision. However, the magistrate judge also concluded that <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> did not bar the claims against Gemma and Levine: since the Rossis had sued them before the <i>Gem</i> opinion issued, the Rossis had not been \"state-court losers\" at the time suit was filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge nonetheless concluded that both claim and issue preclusion barred the &#167; 1983 claims against Gemma and Levine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> As to claim preclusion, the magistrate judge found that the Rossis could have asserted their &#167; 1983 claim as a counterclaim in the lien enforcement proceeding. Their failure to do so, in the magistrate judge's view, meant that their claim was barred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> As to issue preclusion, the magistrate judge read the Rhode Island Supreme Court's decision in <i>Gem</i> to have already decided the constitutional claims that the Rossis were presenting in their &#167; 1983 action. Thus the magistrate judge held that issue preclusion provided an independent reason to bar the constitutional claims against Gemma and Levine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge next turned to the state law slander of title claim against Gemma and Levine, and he concluded that the court should abstain from deciding that claim under the doctrine of <i>Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109405\"><a href=\"/opinion/109405/colorado-river-water-cons-dist-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109405\"><a href=\"/opinion/109405/colorado-river-water-cons-dist-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span> (1976). Additionally, the magistrate judge recommended that the district court decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over this state law claim; the judge explained that he had recommended dismissal of all federal claims, and that, under state law, the slander of title claim was not yet ripe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rossis objected to the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, and the issues from the first federal lawsuit were presented to the district court. The court adopted the magistrate judge's analysis and conclusion. Simultaneously, the district court considered a motion for judgment on the pleadings that Gem had filed in the second federal lawsuit. The court concluded that the arguments presented in the lawsuit against Gem were identical to the arguments presented in the lawsuit against Gemma and Levine, and it granted Gem's motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rossis appealed the district court's decision in both cases, and we consolidated the appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties present to us essentially the same arguments that they made in the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> The defendants argue that there are a number of reasons why the district court correctly dismissed the Rossis' claims, while the Rossis contend that each of these arguments is in error. Nearly all of the dispute surrounds the dismissal of the Rossis' &#167; 1983 claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not reach the merits of these arguments, and we instead conclude that abstention is the appropriate course. However, in order to understand our abstention analysis, it is important to understand the differing ways that the parties read the Rhode Island Supreme Court's opinion in <i>Gem.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rossis explicitly disavow any attempt to undo the state court decision in <i>Gem</i> upholding the constitutionality of the Mechanics' Lien Law. Rather, they believe that their &#167; 1983 claims are targeted towards a narrow issue: the fact that the operation of the Rhode Island statute deprived <i>them</i> of a prompt opportunity for a hearing, notwithstanding the fact that the statute <i>now</i> provides such a hearing for others. The Rossis read <i>Gem</i> as having decided only a facial attack on the Mechanics' Lien Law. They contend that when the Rhode Island Supreme Court remanded the case, it intended for the Superior Court to decide any as-applied claims that the Rossis might have.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rossis also point out that their &#167; 1983 claims include a request for damages. Thus even if one interpreted <i>Gem</i> as deciding an as-applied constitutional challenge, the Rossis argue that one could still read <i>Gem's</i> \"retrospectivity determination\" &#8212; its decision to evaluate the Rossis' constitutional claims with reference to the <i>amended</i> Mechanics' Lien Law &#8212; as having been made solely in the context of the Rossis' motion to dismiss the enforcement action against them.

Although the doctrine is frequently associated with state criminal prosecutions, it has been extended to certain \"coercive\" civil cases. <i>See Maym&#243;-Mel&#233;ndez,</i> 364 F.3d at 31 &amp; n. 3. Following Supreme Court case law, <i>see Middlesex County,</i> 457 U.S. at 432, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110750\"><a href=\"/opinion/110750/middlesex-county-ethics-comm-v-garden-state-bar-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Abstention is appropriate when the requested relief would interfere (1) with an ongoing state judicial proceeding; (2) that implicates an important state interest; and (3) that provides an adequate opportunity for the federal plaintiff to advance his federal constitutional challenge. <i>See Brooks v.

Granting the Rossis' requests for injunctive relief would substantially interfere with the lien enforcement proceeding: if the Rossis obtain the return of their funds from the court registry, they will deprive the Superior Court of its ability to satisfy any claim that Gem may have against those funds. <i>See Rio Grande,</i> 397 F.3d at 70 (\"Interference is . . . usually expressed as a proceeding that either enjoins the state proceeding or has the `practical effect' of doing so.\"); <i>see also Keystone Elevator Co., Inc. v. Johnson &amp; Wales Univ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2364360\"><a href=\"/opinion/2364360/keystone-elevator-co-v-johnson-wales-univ/\"><span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span>, 923 (R.I.2004) (explaining that once there has been a lien substitution, the funds in the registry become the sole security for the former-lienholder's claim). Similarly, if the Rossis obtain their requested declaratory relief, and it is adjudged that the old Mechanics' Lien Law is unconstitutional as applied to them, they will essentially have obtained a judgment that the continuation of the state proceeding against them violates their due process rights. This too is interference for <i>Younger</i> purposes. <i>See Samuels v.

There is an ongoing judicial proceeding, as the lien enforcement action remains pending before the Superior Court. And it is clear that the state proceeding provides an adequate forum for the Rossis to present their constitutional challenge. Indeed, the Rossis raised a due process challenge, had it at least partially adjudicated by the state courts, and now actively contend that their as-applied challenge is or will be pending before the Superior Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That leaves the second <i>Younger</i> requirement, that \"an important state interest\" be implicated.

Pennzoil won a large jury verdict, and if it recorded this judgment in any Texas county, and followed certain other procedures, Texas law would have allowed it to enforce the judgment through forced sale of Texaco property. <i>See id.</i> A separate Texas rule provided that if Texaco wished to appeal the trial court judgment, the only way Texaco could stave off enforcement of the judgment during the appeal was if it posted a bond. <i>Id.</i> at 4-5, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111856\"><a href=\"/opinion/111856/pennzoil-co-v-texaco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And the Third Circuit, anxious to find a limiting principle for <i>Pennzoil,</i> has speculated that \"in an appropriate case,\" <i>Younger</i> may not bar interference with a \"privately initiated state proceeding in which the state court has not yet rendered judgment.\" <i>Schall v.

Consistent with the <i>in rem</i> nature of the proceeding, the Superior Court has taken jurisdiction over a res, and the Rossis' funds are in the court's registry.

However, the threshold <i>Younger</i> issue, that the requested relief <i>interfere</i> with an ongoing judicial proceeding, necessitates slightly more discussion in the damages context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recognized that a &#167; 1983 damages award may interfere with a state proceeding because it can have the same practical effect as a declaratory judgment: the federal court has produced a ruling on the merits that the federal plaintiff can then use to alter the state proceeding. <i>See Landrigan,</i> 628 F.2d at 743; <i>accord Deakins,</i> 484 U.S. at 209, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111975\"><a href=\"/opinion/111975/deakins-v-monaghan/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If the Rossis obtain a &#167; 1983 damages award based on a successful due process argument, there is little practical difference than if they had obtained a declaratory judgment based on the same constitutional claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of this, we think that abstention is appropriate on the &#167; 1983 damages claims, in addition to the abstention on the &#167; 1983 equitable claims. However, there is one important difference. When a court orders abstention on a damages claim, it ordinarily may only stay the action, rather than dismiss the action in its entirety. <i>See Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins.

We think it is more appropriate to treat it as a separate claim for relief arising under state law<i>Cf. Peckham v. Hirschfeld,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1526931\"><a href=\"/opinion/1526931/peckham-v-hirschfeld/\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">663</span></a></span>, 666-67 (R.I.1990) (stating the elements for slander of title under state law). We note that if we treated the claim as the magistrate judge did, it would not change our analysis.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We also note that the Rossis have apparently abandoned, in federal court, any claim for relief under the Rhode Island Constitution. Throughout their brief, the Rossis refer to their constitutional claims as arising under &#167; 1983, which of course only applies to the deprivation of rights guaranteed by federal law. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. Moreover, the Rossis' brief never cites the Rhode Island constitutional provision that they relied on in their complaint. In fact, they identify their slander of title claim as the only state law claim over which the district court should have exercised supplemental jurisdiction. In these circumstances, we believe that the Rossis have waived any argument that the district court erred in dismissing their state constitutional claims. <i>See Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543590\"><a href=\"/opinion/543590/playboy-enterprises-inc-v-public-service-commission-of-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 40-41 (1st Cir.1990) (issues not raised in an appellant's opening brief are waived); <i>United States v.

In at least two post-<i>Wilton</i> cases, we have simply said that review is for \"abuse of discretion.\" <i>See Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. R.I. Pub. Transit Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199171\"><a href=\"/opinion/199171/hartford-fire-v-ri-public-transit/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span>, 130 (1st Cir.2000); <i>DeNovellis v.

In another post-<i>Wilton</i> case, however, we said that review \"`is conducted under a standard slightly more rigorous than abuse of discretion.'\" <i>Diaz-Fonseca v. Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202265\"><a href=\"/opinion/202265/diaz-fonseca-v-commonwealth-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Nat'l R.R.

We need not resolve any apparent inconsistency here, as under either articulation of the standard the district court acted well within its discretion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> The Rossis point out that while Gem is a party to the state court lien enforcement petition, Levine and Gemma are not<i>Cf. Brillhart,</i> 316 U.S. at 495, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1173</span></span> (\"Ordinarily it would be uneconomical as well as vexatious for a federal court to proceed in a declaratory judgment suit where another suit is pending in a state court presenting the same issues, not governed by federal law, <i>between the same parties.</i>\") (emphasis added). Yet the Rossis have not disputed the magistrate judge's finding that Gemma and Levine are in privity with Gem. In this situation, we cannot say that the district court acted outside its discretion in declining to adjudicate the Rossis' claim for declaratory relief. <i>Cf. New Beckley Mining Corp. v. Int'l Union,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570038\"><a href=\"/opinion/570038/new-beckley-mining-corporation-v-international-union-united-mine-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1072</span></a></span>, 1073 (4th Cir.1991) (explaining that suits can trigger <i>Colorado River</i> abstention when they involve \"substantially the same parties\"); <i>LaDuke v.

Geffroy,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></span>, 581 (R.I.1985). That may or may not be correct. But the Rossis' claim for relief is based on slander of title, a claim which requires a showing that \"the defendant maliciously uttered false statements about the plaintiff's ownership of real estate which resulted in the plaintiff sustaining an actual pecuniary loss.\" <i>DeLeo v. Anthony A. Nunes, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2291874\"><a href=\"/opinion/2291874/deleo-v-anthony-a-nunes-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1344</span></a></span>, 1346 (R.I.1988). The Rossis' theory is that because the lien was invalid under the Mechanics' Lien Law, it was therefore \"defamatory from the outset.\" It is not at all clear that such a scenario is equivalent to the malicious uttering of false statements.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
