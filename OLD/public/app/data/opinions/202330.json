Jay Garcia-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                    Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n          Mariángela Tirado-Vales on brief for appellant.\n          Mariana E. Bauzá-Almonte, Assistant United States\nAttorney, Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, and\nH.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              August 1, 2006\n\f          Per Curiam.   Perry Santiago-Salazar pleaded guilty to\n\npossessing cocaine with intent to distribute after law enforcement\n\nofficials seized a cocaine-filled suitcase that he had placed\n\naboard an airline flight from Puerto Rico to New York.       At his\n\nsentencing hearing in the District Court for the District of Puerto\n\nRico, Santiago-Salazar requested a downward adjustment in his\n\nfederal Sentencing Guidelines offense level, arguing that he had\n\nplayed only a minor role in the offense.    See USSG § 3B1.2.    The\n\ncourt denied the adjustment and, after making other applicable\n\nadjustments, sentenced the defendant to 87 months in prison.\n\n          On appeal, Santiago-Salazar contends that the district\n\ncourt erred in declining to grant him the downward adjustment.    We\n\nreview a district court's role-in-the-offense determination for\n\nclear error.   See United States v. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d 146,\n\n148-49 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d\n\n330, 333 (1st Cir. 1990)).   The determination whether a defendant\n\nhas played only a \"minor\" or \"minimal\" role in the offense, USSG §\n\n3B1.2, is \"notoriously fact-sensitive.\"    Id. at 148.   A defendant\n\nseeking a minor-role adjustment bears the burden of showing that he\n\nis (1) less culpable than most other people involved in the\n\nparticular offense for which he was convicted and (2) less culpable\n\nthan most other perpetrators of comparable crimes.       See United\n\nStates v. Mateo-Espejo, 426 F.3d 508, 512 (1st Cir. 2005).       The\n\ndefendant here has made no such showing.      To the contrary, the\n\n\n                                -2-\n\ffacts indicate that Santiago-Salazar was in charge of the illicit\n\ntransaction, since he not only orchestrated the shipment of the\n\nsuitcase but had follow-up conversations and meetings with a\n\nconfidential source to determine the status of the suitcase and\n\nobtain a receipt for the drugs.      The district court cited these\n\nfollow-up activities as cause to deny the minor-role adjustment.\n\nWe see no clear error in this logical determination.    In fact, we\n\nhave affirmed denials of minor-role adjustments to defendants who\n\nwere simply couriers of contraband and did not engage in follow-up\n\nactivities like the defendant in this case.   See Mateo-Espejo, 426\n\nF.3d at 512-13 (collecting cases).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f",
