GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\n\n                             Respondent.\n\n\n\n\n              ON PETITION FOR REVIEW OF AN ORDER OF THE\n\n                    BOARD OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS\n\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n                Cyr and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Wei Jia, and Law Office of Wei Jia, on brief for petitioner.\n     Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, and Michael P.\nIannotti, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n\n                          February 15, 2006\n\f          CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.     Zhi-Ming Huang, a native and\n\ncitizen of the People’s Republic of China (\"China\"), arrived in the\n\nUnited   States   in   1992,   seeking   political   asylum    based   on\n\nallegations that (i) he and his wife had violated China’s “one-\n\nchild-per-family” birth control policy, (ii) the Chinese government\n\nhad fined them for these allegations and forced his wife to wear an\n\nintra-uterine contraceptive device, and (iii) he would be punished\n\nin the event he were to be repatriated to China.        An immigration\n\njudge (“IJ”) rejected the asylum petition after Huang failed to\n\nappear at the scheduled deportation hearing.\n\n          In 2002, after the statutory definition of the term\n\n“refugee” was amended, see 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42) (addressing\n\nasylum from “coercive population control program[s]”), Huang was\n\npermitted to reopen the deportation hearing and amend his asylum\n\napplication. Huang then alleged, for the first time, that his wife\n\nhad undergone a forced sterilization following the birth of a\n\nsecond child, in 1990, and that he later fled China following a\n\nviolent confrontation with a government official.         Following a\n\nhearing before an IJ, the amended petition was denied due to\n\nseveral important inconsistencies between the statements Huang made\n\nin 1992 and those he made in 2002; particularly, his failure to\n\nallege in 1992 that his wife had been forcibly sterilized.        The IJ\n\nconcluded that Huang had failed to establish past persecution. See\n\nINS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 428 (1987).             Huang then\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fappealed    to   the   Board   of    Immigration   Appeals    (\"BIA\"),    which\n\naffirmed without opinion.       He now petitions for review.\n\n            An   applicant     for    political    asylum     must   establish\n\neligibility, see 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a), by either (i) demonstrating\n\na well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion, see id. § 208.13(b)(2), or (ii) establishing a rebuttable\n\npresumption that he harbors a well-founded fear of persecution, by\n\ndemonstrating past persecution based upon any one of the five\n\nstatutory   grounds,     see   id.   §    208.13(b)(1).      See   Mihaylov   v.\n\nAshcroft, 379 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir. 2004); 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)\n\n(defining persecution under a “coercive population control program”\n\nas persecution based upon “political opinion”).\n\n            Huang first argues that the IJ either failed to provide\n\nan explicit determination that the testimony Huang gave was not\n\ncredible, or, assuming that such a finding was implicitly made, it\n\nis unsupported by “substantial evidence” in the record. Rodriguez-\n\nRamirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2005).                  On the\n\ncontrary, the IJ explicitly stated:            “I find that the applicant’s\n\ntestimony is inconsistent and contradictory concerning just exactly\n\nwhat happened in China,” then went on to point out Huang’s failure\n\nto mention his wife’s forced sterilization until 2002, when he\n\nrenewed his asylum application. The IJ rationally rejected Huang’s\n\nsuggestion that this significant omission was a mere “oversight.”\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fSee Bojorques-Villanueva v. INS, 194 F.3d 14, 16 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(noting the efficacy of adverse credibility determinations based\n\nupon       discrepancies    which   “involved   the   heart   of   the    asylum\n\nclaim”).1         Although Huang now contends that in 1992 the airport\n\nworker      and    other   immigration   employees    misunderstood      or   mis-\n\ntranscribed his account, the IJ was not compelled to accept that\n\nunsupported supposition, particularly in light of the sheer number\n\nof other discrepancies.         See Mihaylov, 379 F.3d at 21 (noting that\n\nIJ’s credibility determinations are entitled to utmost deference\n\nunless record compels contrary finding).\n\n               Finally, Huang asserts that the IJ erred in excluding the\n\nsupporting documentation by which he sought to establish that his\n\nwife did undergo a forced sterilization.2               This issue has been\n\nwaived due to failure to appeal it to the BIA.             See Opere v. INS,\n\n267 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      A lack of credibility on the part of Huang is further\nevidenced by a series of additional discrepancies, including\ndivergent statements regarding his occupation, the amount of the\nfine imposed for violating the one-child policy, whether it was\nbefore or after the birth of Huang’s second child in 1990 that the\ngovernment compelled his wife to use an IUD, and which countries he\npassed through en route to the United States.\n       2\n      For example, Huang introduced a photograph of his wife’s\nsurgical scar, the report of a New York physician attesting that x-\nrays were consistent with the scarring that would result from\nforced sterilization, and hospital records from China showing that\nshe underwent the sterilization procedure. However, the IJ refused\nto review the documents due to lack of proper authentication. See\n8 C.F.R. § 287.6.\n\n                                         -4-\n\f          After considering all issues presented in the petition,\n\nwe affirm the BIA decision.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
