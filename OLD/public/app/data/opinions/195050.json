We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n          In February  1989,  Blanco  pled  guilty  to  three\n\ncounts  of possessing  cocaine  with  intent  to  distribute,\n\nviolations of  21  U.S.C.    841(a)(1)  and (b)(1)(C).    The\n\ndistrict  court  applied  U.S.S.G.     2D1.1  in  determining\n\nBlanco's offense level and, in April 1989, imposed a sentence\n\nof 84  months imprisonment.   On appeal,  we affirmed,  inter\n                                                             \n\nalia,  the  use  of  a kilogram  of  cocaine  for  sentencing\n    \n\npurposes - - despite Blanco's contentions that the charges to\n\nwhich  he pled guilty involved only 125  grams of cocaine - -\n\nbecause  the   additional  drug   quantities  were   properly\n\ncountable  under  U.S.S.G.    1B1.3(a)  as part  of  the same\n\nconduct, scheme, or plan as  the convicted offenses.   United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.  Blanco, 888 F.2d  907, 909  (1st Cir.  1989).   In\n                 \n\nApril 1992, Blanco  filed a pro se motion  to vacate sentence\n                                  \n\nunder 28  U.S.C.    2255 alleging  ineffective assistance  of\n\ncounsel,  that his  plea  was involuntary,  and  that he  was\n\ndeprived his presentence report rights under Fed. R. Civ.  P.\n\n32.   The district court  denied the motion and  we affirmed.\n\nUnited States v. Blanco, No. 92-2024 (1st Cir. Jun. 9, 1993).\n                       \n\nIn December 1992,  Blanco filed this motion  for modification\n\nalleging that  he  was entitled  to a  reduction in  sentence\n\nbecause of  a November  1992 amendment to  the commentary  to\n\nguideline    2D1.1.   Blanco contended  that under  Amendment\n\n447, App. C at 269-71,  which revised application note1 12 to\n\n  2D1.1, his  offense level should be reduced  because he was\n\nnot  reasonably capable of  producing a kilogram  of cocaine.\n\nIn reply to the government's opposition to the motion, Blanco\n\nasserted,  for  the   first  time,  that  his   attorney  was\n\nineffective in failing to raise the \"capability\" defense.2\n\n                    \n\n1.  Note 12 of the commentary to   2D1.1 deals with types and\nquantities of drugs not specified in the count  of conviction\nwhich  may  be  considered,  under     1B1.3(a)(2)  (relevant\nconduct), in  determining the  offense level.   The  revision\nupon which Blanco relies states, in pertinent part:\n     In an offense involving negotiation to traffic in a\n     controlled substance, the  weight under negotiation\n     in an  uncompleted distribution  shall  be used  to\n     calculate  the applicable  amount.   However, where\n     the court finds  that the defendant did  not intend\n     and was  not  reasonably capable  of producing  the\n     negotiated amount, the court shall exclude from the\n     guideline calculation the amount that it finds  the\n     defendant did  not intend  to produce  and was  not\n     reasonably capable of producing.\nThe second sentence is identical to one formerly appearing in\n   2D1.4 (attempts  and  conspiracies),  comment.  (n.1),  by\nvirtue of  Amendment 136,  effective November  1, 1989.   See\n                                                             \nApp.  C at  64.    Amendment  447 deleted     2D1.4  and  its\napplication  notes and  moved much  of that  text into  the  \n2D1.1 commentary.  App. C at 270.\n     In  April  1989,  when Blanco  was  sentenced,    2D4.1,\ncomment.  (n.1) provided, in  part: \"Where the  defendant was\nnot reasonably  capable of  producing the negotiated  amount,\nthe court  may depart  and impose a  sentence lower  than the\n              \nsentence that would otherwise  result.\"  (Emphasis supplied).\nAmendment 136 replaced  this sentence by the  second sentence\nquoted  above, and  that  replacement  was  carried  over  in\nAmendment 447. \n\n2.  Such  claims  are outside  the  scope of  a    3582(c)(2)\nmotion.  Even if we were to  construe this motion as a   2255\npetition, since,  as the  discussion below  indicates, Blanco\n\n                             -3-\n\n          The   district   court   denied  the   motion   for\n\nmodification  of  sentence reasoning  that  the  amendment on\n\nwhich Blanco relied  was not retroactive  because it was  not\n\nspecifically   listed  in   guideline   policy  statement    \n\n1B1.10(d).   That, the  district  court decided,  effectively\n\n\"closed  the  door\"  on the  retroactive  application  of the\n\namendment to   2D1.1.  Blanco's principal  argument on appeal\n\nis  that  he was  improperly  sentenced  on  the basis  of  a\n\nnegotiated-for quantity of  cocaine, a kilogram, that  he was\n\nincapable of producing.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n          A  sentence  may be  reduced  only under  extremely\n\nnarrow circumstances.  18 U.S.C.   3582(c).  \"[T]he court may\n\nnot modify a  term of imprisonment once it  has been imposed\"\n\nunless  \"such a reduction  is consistent with  the applicable\n\npolicy  statements issued by  the Sentencing Commission.\"    \n\n3582(c)(2).    Contrary  to  Blanco's  argument  that  policy\n\nstatements, such as    1B1.10, are no more  than interpretive\n\nguides,   the  Supreme  Court  has  made  plain  that  \"[t]he\n\nprinciple  that the Guidelines  Manual is binding  on federal\n\ncourts  applies as  well to policy  statements.\"   Stinson v.\n                                                          \n\nUnited States, 113 S. Ct.  1913, 1917 (1993), citing Williams\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\nhas   no  legal  right  to  benefit  from  the  post-sentence\namendments to   2D1.1, no prejudice resulted from the alleged\nineffective assistance.   Hill v.  Lockhart, 474 U.S.  52, 59\n                                           \n(1985).\n\n                             -4-\n\nv. United States,  112 S. Ct. 1112, 1119  (1992) (\"[A] policy\n                \n\nstatement  [which] prohibits a  district court from  taking a\n\nspecified  action .  . .  is  an authoritative  guide to  the\n\nmeaning of the applicable guideline.\").\n\n          Moreover,  \"[i]n addition to the duty to review and\n                                               \n\nrevise the  guidelines, Congress  has granted the  Commission\n\nthe unusual  explicit  power to  decide whether  and to  what\n                            \n\nextent  its  amendments  reducing  sentences  will  be  given\n\nretroactive effect.  28 U.S.C.   994(u).  This power has been\n\nimplemented  in  Guideline    1B1.10,  which  sets  forth the\n\namendments  that justify  sentence  reduction.\"   Braxton  v.\n                                                         \n\nUnited  States, 111  S.

Havener, 905  F.2d 3, 7 (1st  Cir. 1990), we  noted\n                 \n\nthat policy statement   1B1.10 \"expressly forbids retroactive\n\napplication\"  of  an  amendment not  listed  in    1B1.10(d).\n\nSection  1B1.10(a) provides, in  pertinent part: \"If  none of\n\nthe  amendments listed  in subsection  (d)  is applicable,  a\n\nreduction  in the defendant's  term of imprisonment  under 18\n\nU.S.C.    3582(c)(2)  is not  consistent  with this  policy.\"\n\nNeither Amendment 447 nor  Amendment 136, both  post-sentence\n\ncommentary amendments to   2D1.1,  see n.1, are included in  \n                                      \n\n1B1.10(d)'s list  of amendments  intended to  be retroactive.\n\nThus,  as  the  district  court  correctly  found,     1B1.10\n\n                             -5-\n\ncontrols.3.   Since the    3582(c)(2) relief  sought here  is\n\ntriggered  only if a  subsequent amendment to  the Guidelines\n\nappears  on the    1B1.10(d) list,  it would  be inconsistent\n\nwith the  Commission's policy statements  to apply  Amendment\n\n447 or  136 retroactively  and to  reduce Blanco's  sentence.\n\nSee  United States  v.

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1989, Blanco pled guilty to three counts of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute, violations of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C).  The district court applied U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1 in determining Blanco's offense level and, in April 1989, imposed a sentence of 84 months imprisonment.  On appeal, we affirmed, inter alia, the use of a kilogram of cocaine for sentencing purposes despite Blanco's contentions that the charges to which he pled guilty involved only 125 grams of cocaine because the additional drug quantities were properly countable under U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a) as part of the same conduct, scheme, or plan as the convicted offenses.   United States v. Blanco, 888 F.2d 907, 909 (1st Cir. 1989).  In April 1992, Blanco filed a pro se motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255 alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, that his plea was involuntary, and that he was deprived his presentence report rights under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 32.  The district court denied the motion and we affirmed.  United States v. Blanco, No. 92-2024 (1st Cir.  Jun. 9, 1993).  In December 1992, Blanco filed this motion for modification alleging that he was entitled to a reduction in sentence because of a November 1992 amendment to the commentary to guideline Sec. 2D1.1.  Blanco contended that under Amendment 447, App.  C at 269-71, which revised application note<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> 12 to Sec. 2D1.1, his offense level should be reduced because he was not reasonably capable of producing a kilogram of cocaine.  In reply to the government's opposition to the motion, Blanco asserted, for the first time, that his attorney was ineffective in failing to raise the \"capability\" defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the motion for modification of sentence reasoning that the amendment on which Blanco relied was not retroactive because it was not specifically listed in guideline policy statement Sec. 1B1.10(d).  That, the district court decided, effectively \"closed the door\" on the retroactive application of the amendment to Sec. 2D1.1.  Blanco's principal argument on appeal is that he was improperly sentenced on the basis of a negotiated-for quantity of cocaine, a kilogram, that he was incapable of producing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sentence may be reduced only under extremely narrow circumstances.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3582(c).  \"[T]he court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed\" unless \"such a reduction is consistent with the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\" Sec. 3582(c)(2).  Contrary to Blanco's argument that policy statements, such as Sec. 1B1.10, are no more than interpretive guides, the Supreme Court has made plain that \"[t]he principle that the Guidelines Manual is binding on federal courts applies as well to policy statements.\"   Stinson v. United States, 113 S. Ct. 1913, 1917 (1993), citing  Williams v. United States, 112 S. Ct. 1112, 1119 (1992) (\"[A] policy statement [which] prohibits a district court from taking a specified action ... is an authoritative guide to the meaning of the applicable guideline.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, \"[i]n addition to the duty to review and revise the guidelines, Congress has granted the Commission the unusual explicit power to decide whether and to what extent its amendments reducing sentences will be given retroactive effect. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(u).  This power has been implemented in Guideline Sec. 1B1.10, which sets forth the amendments that justify sentence reduction.\"   Braxton v. United States, 111 S. Ct. 1854, 1858 (1991).  In  United States v. Havener, 905 F.2d 3, 7 (1st Cir. 1990), we noted that policy statement Sec. 1B1.10 \"expressly forbids retroactive application\" of an amendment not listed in Sec. 1B1.10(d).  Section 1B1.10(a) provides, in pertinent part:  \"If none of the amendments listed in subsection (d) is applicable, a reduction in the defendant's term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3582(c)(2) is not consistent with this policy.\"  Neither Amendment 447 nor Amendment 136, both post-sentence commentary amendments to Sec. 2D1.1, see n.1, are included in Sec. 1B1.10(d)'s list of amendments intended to be retroactive.  Thus, as the district court correctly found, Sec. 1B1.10 controls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>   Since the Sec. 3582(c)(2) relief sought here is triggered only if a subsequent amendment to the Guidelines appears on the Sec. 1B1.10(d) list, it would be inconsistent with the Commission's policy statements to apply Amendment 447 or 136 retroactively and to reduce Blanco's sentence.   See United States v. Avila, 997 F.2d 767, 768 (10th Cir. 1993);   United States v. Wilson, 997 F.2d 429, 431 (8th Cir. 1993);   Desouza v.

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1989, Blanco pled guilty to three counts of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute, violations of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C).  The district court applied U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1 in determining Blanco's offense level and, in April 1989, imposed a sentence of 84 months imprisonment.  On appeal, we affirmed, inter alia, the use of a kilogram of cocaine for sentencing purposes despite Blanco's contentions that the charges to which he pled guilty involved only 125 grams of cocaine because the additional drug quantities were properly countable under U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a) as part of the same conduct, scheme, or plan as the convicted offenses.   United States v. Blanco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531324\"><a href=\"/opinion/531324/united-states-v-alfonso-blanco/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span>, 909 (1st Cir. 1989).  In April 1992, Blanco filed a pro se motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255 alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, that his plea was involuntary, and that he was deprived his presentence report rights under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 32.  The district court denied the motion and we affirmed.  United States v. Blanco, No. 92-2024 (1st Cir.  Jun. 9, 1993).  In December 1992, Blanco filed this motion for modification alleging that he was entitled to a reduction in sentence because of a November 1992 amendment to the commentary to guideline Sec. 2D1.1.  Blanco contended that under Amendment 447, App.  C at 269-71, which revised application note<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> 12 to Sec. 2D1.1, his offense level should be reduced because he was not reasonably capable of producing a kilogram of cocaine.  In reply to the government's opposition to the motion, Blanco asserted, for the first time, that his attorney was ineffective in failing to raise the \"capability\" defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the motion for modification of sentence reasoning that the amendment on which Blanco relied was not retroactive because it was not specifically listed in guideline policy statement Sec. 1B1.10(d).  That, the district court decided, effectively \"closed the door\" on the retroactive application of the amendment to Sec. 2D1.1.  Blanco's principal argument on appeal is that he was improperly sentenced on the basis of a negotiated-for quantity of cocaine, a kilogram, that he was incapable of producing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sentence may be reduced only under extremely narrow circumstances.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3582(c).  \"[T]he court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed\" unless \"such a reduction is consistent with the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\" Sec. 3582(c)(2).  Contrary to Blanco's argument that policy statements, such as Sec. 1B1.10, are no more than interpretive guides, the Supreme Court has made plain that \"[t]he principle that the Guidelines Manual is binding on federal courts applies as well to policy statements.\"   Stinson v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112854\"><a href=\"/opinion/112854/stinson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Sec. 994(u).  This power has been implemented in Guideline Sec. 1B1.10, which sets forth the amendments that justify sentence reduction.\"   Braxton v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112600\"><a href=\"/opinion/112600/braxton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Havener, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542933\"><a href=\"/opinion/542933/united-states-v-larry-c-havener/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir. 1990), we noted that policy statement Sec. 1B1.10 \"expressly forbids retroactive application\" of an amendment not listed in Sec. 1B1.10(d).  Section 1B1.10(a) provides, in pertinent part:  \"If none of the amendments listed in subsection (d) is applicable, a reduction in the defendant's term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3582(c)(2) is not consistent with this policy.\"  Neither Amendment 447 nor Amendment 136, both post-sentence commentary amendments to Sec. 2D1.1, see n.1, are included in Sec. 1B1.10(d)'s list of amendments intended to be retroactive.  Thus, as the district court correctly found, Sec. 1B1.10 controls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>   Since the Sec. 3582(c)(2) relief sought here is triggered only if a subsequent amendment to the Guidelines appears on the Sec. 1B1.10(d) list, it would be inconsistent with the Commission's policy statements to apply Amendment 447 or 136 retroactively and to reduce Blanco's sentence.
