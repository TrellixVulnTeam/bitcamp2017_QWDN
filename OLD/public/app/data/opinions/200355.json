Ronald R. Lagueux, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                 Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     David A. Levy for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Gerard B. Sullivan, Assistant United States Attorney, and\nMargaret Curran, United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                       February 25, 2003\n\f            STAHL,   Senior    Circuit    Judge.      After    a   jury   trial,\n\ndefendant-appellant Dunn Beckett was convicted of one count of\n\npossessing a sawed-off shotgun in violation of 26 U.S.C. §§ 5841,\n\n5861(d), and 5871 (2002).       Police officers discovered the shotgun\n\nin plain view at Beckett’s residence while executing a state court\n\nwarrant seeking evidence of Beckett’s involvement in two murders.\n\nBeckett now appeals from the denial of his pretrial motion to\n\nsuppress the weapon and the denial of his motion for acquittal.\n\n                               I. Background\n\nA.          Procedural history\n\n            On August 15, 2001, a Rhode Island magistrate issued a\n\nwarrant permitting law enforcement to search Beckett's residence in\n\nCumberland, Rhode Island.       The search warrant authorized officers\n\nto search for (1) the weapon used in the second murder, a .38\n\ncaliber pistol; (2) paperwork and other items relating to a .38\n\ncaliber pistol; and (3) notebooks or personal papers \"recording the\n\nwhereabouts\" of Beckett in 1992 and 1995, when the two murders\n\noccurred.\n\n            The search warrant application included a seventeen-page\n\naffidavit detailing Beckett’s alleged role as the triggerman in\n\nthe   two   murders.     The    affidavit,    which    is     described    more\n\nthoroughly infra, recited the confession of James St. Jacques that\n\nhe personally saw Beckett fire the rifle used in the first murder\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fand the pistol used in the second murder, as well as statements\n\nfrom other witnesses, autopsy and ballistics evidence, and record\n\nchecks.\n\n           On August 16, 2001, federal and state officers executed\n\nthe search warrant.    In Beckett’s garage, the sawed-off shotgun\n\nwas discovered in plain view.\n\n           On September 19, 2001, a federal grand jury in the\n\nDistrict of Rhode Island returned a one-count indictment charging\n\nthat on or about August 16, 2001, Beckett possessed a sawed-off\n\nshotgun in violation of 26 U.S.C. §§ 5841, 5861(d), and 5871.   On\n\nNovember 21, 2001, Beckett moved to suppress the shotgun, claiming\n\nthat, inter alia, the search warrant was not supported by probable\n\ncause.\n\n           After hearing argument and taking evidence, the district\n\ncourt determined that there was probable cause justifying a search\n\nfor a .38 caliber pistol and any paperwork relating to such a\n\npistol.1   It stated that \"[d]espite the great length of time since\n\nthe [second] murder was committed, there was still sufficient\n\nprobable cause that the defendant committed the murder, and that\n\nhe may well still have evidence which supports the criminal\n\ncharge.\"    Alternatively, the court held that the warrant came\n\nunder the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule announced\n\n\n     1\n      The court did not reach the issue of the validity of the\nwarrant with regard to the notebooks.\n\n                                -3-\n\fin United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984): \"There’s nothing to\n\nindicate that there was any bad faith here.          And there was nothing\n\nthat would indicate to any law enforcement officer that the\n\nwarrant was so defective that no reasonable person would rely on\n\nthat.\"\n\n          Following a two-day jury trial in March, 2002, Beckett\n\nwas convicted of possessing the sawed-off shotgun, and on July 9,\n\n2002, the court sentenced him to 33 months of imprisonment.\n\nB.           Search warrant affidavit\n\n             The   affidavit    in   support    of   the   search   warrant\n\napplication was signed by Donald R. Beech, a detective with the\n\nPawtucket,    Rhode    Island   Police     Department.     It   stated   the\n\nfollowing:\n\n          On August 13, 1992, a jogger found the body of Robert J.\n\nLaforest in a wooded area in Smithfield, Rhode Island.           An autopsy\n\nrevealed that he had been shot four times with a .222 or .223\n\ncaliber gun.       Laforest’s mother reported that she had last seen\n\nhim on August 11, 1992, when he said he was going to visit a\n\nfriend named James St. Jacques.\n\n          On September 15, 2000, St. Jacques confessed that he had\n\npaid Beckett $15,000 to murder Laforest.             St. Jacques explained\n\nthat he used Paul Ferguson as an intermediary to negotiate the\n\ncontract killing with Beckett, paying Ferguson $9,000 for his role\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fas middleman.     Beckett, who was then living in California, flew\n\ninto Rhode Island shortly before the murder.       St. Jacques and\n\nFerguson met Beckett at the airport and took him to the Days Inn\n\nHotel at India Point in Providence, where he stayed during the\n\nvisit.     On August 11, 1992, the day of the murder, Beckett drove\n\nSt. Jacques's car to a wooded area in Smithfield, while St.\n\nJacques remained at his own house.        St. Jacques then phoned\n\nLaforest and accompanied him to the wooded area where Beckett was\n\nwaiting.     When Laforest got out of the truck, Beckett shot him\n\nseveral times with Laforest's AR 15 rifle (which had been left for\n\nsafekeeping with St. Jacques).     Later that day, St. Jacques took\n\nBeckett to the airport and gave him $7,500, the first half of the\n\n$15,000 fee.     Ferguson, the middleman, delivered the remaining\n\n$7,500 to Beckett during an August 20, 1992 trip to California.\n\n            Also on September 15, 2000, St. Jacques made an initial\n\nconfession that three years after the murder of Laforest, Beckett\n\nalso killed Ferguson.      He said that between the two murders,\n\nFerguson was talking too much about the Laforest murder and was\n\ndemanding money from Beckett and St. Jacques.     St. Jacques said\n\nthat he saw Beckett twice on the day of Ferguson’s murder, October\n\n19, 1995: once early in the day, and again that night at a local\n\nbar.     At the bar, Beckett told St. Jacques, \"I shot him and he\n\nwill never be found.\"     As reasons for killing Ferguson, Beckett\n\ncomplained to St. Jacques that Ferguson had told Beckett’s former\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\froommate that Beckett had killed a man in Rhode Island, and that\n\nthis former roommate now was attempting to blackmail him.            When\n\nBeckett later discovered that Ferguson’s family had reported that\n\nFerguson was last seen on Wednesday, October 18, 1995, the day\n\nbefore the murder actually took place, Beckett told St. Jacques\n\nthat the family’s inaccurate report had given him an alibi because\n\nBeckett was at work as a prison guard on October 18 and had taken\n\nthe day off on October 19.\n\n            On August 1, 2001, investigators found Ferguson’s body\n\nwrapped in plastic, buried five feet under a concrete slab in\n\nRehoboth, Massachusetts, on property that had previously belonged\n\nto St. Jacques.       An autopsy disclosed that Ferguson had been shot\n\nat least four times with a weapon \"consistent with a .380 caliber\n\nhandgun (possibly a Llama brand).\"\n\n            On August 3, 2001, two days after Ferguson’s body was\n\nexhumed, St. Jacques elaborated on his earlier confession.           This\n\ntime, he said he had actually witnessed Beckett kill Ferguson and\n\nthat he had helped him dispose of the body.             According to St.\n\nJacques, in October 1995, Beckett and Ferguson visited St. Jacques\n\nat   his   Rehoboth    house.    After    Beckett   accused   Ferguson   of\n\n\"shooting off his mouth,\" the two got into a fight.            During the\n\nfight, Beckett pulled out a black semiautomatic handgun and shot\n\nFerguson at least three times and struck him with the butt of the\n\ngun.   Beckett and St. Jacques then wrapped Ferguson’s body in\n\n                                    -6-\n\fplastic and dumped it into a hole that had been dug for a well.\n\nBeckett kept the gun after the murder.             About a year and a half\n\nlater, St. Jacques hired two men to pour concrete over the site,\n\nto make a foundation for a barn that was never built.\n\n            The    affidavit     set    forth    information    corroborating\n\nmultiple elements of St. Jacques’s confession.                As to the first\n\nmurder,    corroboration       included   St.    Jacques's    wife's   personal\n\nobservations of the first murder preparations; confirmation that\n\nLaforest    owned    an   AR    15     rifle,   which   takes   .223   caliber\n\nammunition; records and witness statements concerning Beckett's\n\ntravel    from    California    and    hotel    stay;   and   confirmation   of\n\nFerguson's payment to Beckett in California. Corroboration of St.\n\nJacques's account of the second murder included, inter alia,\n\nwitnesses' confirmation of the alleged blackmail and dispute with\n\nFerguson; Beckett's employment records showing that Beckett had\n\nbeen at work on October 18, 1995, and that he was off-duty on\n\nOctober 19, 1995; and several witnesses' statements that Beckett\n\n\"regularly carried a handgun.\"\n\n            Finally,      the     affidavit      supporting     the    warrant\n\napplication also addressed Beckett's record keeping.              Records and\n\nwitnesses indicated that by the time of the second murder, in\n\nOctober, 1995, Beckett resided in Lincoln, Rhode Island, and he\n\nworked as a guard at the Wyatt Correctional Facility.                   He was\n\nstill employed at the prison at the time of the search.                 Beckett\n\n                                        -7-\n\flater moved to 783 High Street in Cumberland, Rhode Island, and\n\nthen, at some point before the search, moved to 58 Edgewood Drive,\n\nalso in Cumberland.\n\n              In   February,   2001,    an   \"ordinary   citizen\"    with   no\n\ncriminal record who had known Beckett for more than two years\n\nreported that he had been inside the 783 High Street address and\n\nwas \"familiar with [Beckett's] habits and practices.\" The witness\n\nsaid that Beckett kept small \"spiral type\" notebooks in which he\n\nrecorded \"his whereabouts including days worked and days off,\"\n\nthat these notebooks dated back to 1992, and that the witness had\n\nseen one notebook in particular that \"records his whereabouts in\n\n1995.\"    The witness described Beckett as a \"'pack rat' who saves\n\neverything.\" The affidavit stated, \"Shortly after the witness saw\n\nthese notebooks at the High Street address the witness became\n\naware    of    the   fact   [that]     Beckett   had   moved   his   personal\n\npossessions to his new home at 58 Edgewood Drive in Cumberland,\n\nRhode Island.\"       The witness also accurately described the outside\n\nof 58 Edgewood Drive.\n\n              Also in February, 2001, a second witness who had known\n\nBeckett for at least two years and was familiar with many of his\n\nhabits    reported      that   Beckett       \"fastidiously     recorded     his\n\nwhereabouts\" in a \"spiral type\" notebook that the witness had seen\n\nand that the witness was \"sure that the book reflects work\n\nschedules and days off for 1995.\"             The affidavit stated, \"This\n\n                                       -8-\n\fwitness   indicated   that   the   books   along   with    other   personal\n\nbelongings have recently been moved to 58 Edgewood in Cumberland.\"\n\n                             II. Discussion\n\nA.         Probable cause\n\n           The sawed-off shotgun upon which Beckett's conviction\n\nwas based was not within the scope of the search warrant.               The\n\ngovernment contends that it was lawfully seized, however, pursuant\n\nto the plain view doctrine.     In Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128\n\n(1990), the Supreme Court defined the contours of this doctrine,\n\nholding that \"an essential predicate to [the seizure of evidence\n\nnot within a warrant's purview is] that the officer did not\n\nviolate the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the place from which\n\nthe evidence could be plainly viewed.\"          Id. at 136.    We apply de\n\nnovo review to the district court's ultimate conclusion that the\n\nelements of the doctrine have been satisfied.             United States v.\n\nHamie, 165 F.3d 80, 82 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           Beckett contends that the officers were not lawfully\n\npresent in his residence when they discovered the shotgun because\n\nthe search warrant was not supported by probable cause.            A warrant\n\napplication must demonstrate probable cause to believe that (1) a\n\nparticular   person   has    committed     a   crime   (the   \"commission\"\n\nelement), and (2) enumerated evidence of the offense will be found\n\nat the place to be searched (the \"nexus\" element).            United States\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fv.   Zayas-Diaz,      95    F.3d     105,   110-11     (1st   Cir.       1996).   In\n\ndetermining the sufficiency of an affidavit supporting a search\n\nwarrant, we consider whether the \"totality of the circumstances\"\n\nstated in the affidavit demonstrates probable cause to search the\n\npremises.       United States v. Khounsavanh, 113 F.3d 279, 283 (1st\n\nCir.     1997).       We    examine    the     affidavit      \"in    a    practical,\n\ncommon-sense        fashion    and    accord     considerable        deference    to\n\nreasonable inferences the [issuing judicial officer] may have\n\ndrawn from the attested facts.\"                United States v. Barnard, 299\n\nF.3d 90, 93 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Zayas-Diaz, 95 F.3d at 111)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n               \"In reviewing a denial of a suppression motion, the\n\ndistrict       court's     ultimate    legal     conclusion,        including     the\n\ndetermination that a given set of facts constituted probable\n\ncause,    is    a   question    of    law    subject    to    de    novo    review.\"\n\nKhounsavanh, 113 F.3d at 282 (citing Ornelas v. United States, 517\n\nU.S. 690, 698-99 (1996)).               The district court's findings of\n\nhistorical fact are reviewed for clear error.                 Id.\n\n               If probable cause is lacking, the evidence uncovered\n\nduring the execution of the search warrant normally must be\n\nexcluded from the case against the defendant.                   United States v.\n\nBrunette, 256 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 2001).                 In Leon, the Supreme\n\nCourt carved out an exception to the exclusionary rule, holding\n\nthat \"evidence obtained in objectively reasonable reliance on a\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fsubsequently invalidated search warrant\" need not be suppressed.\n\nSuppression is still appropriate, however, if the warrant is based\n\non an affidavit \"so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to\n\nrender official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\"\n\n468 U.S. at 923 (quoting Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590, 610-611\n\n(1975) (Powell, J., concurring in part)).2\n\n          Beckett's primary argument is that the search warrant\n\nfailed to establish probable cause to believe that the items\n\nsought -- the written records and the firearm -- were located at\n\nhis residence.3   He takes issue with the supporting affidavit's\n\nreliance on the two unnamed informants who stated that the 1992\n\nand 1995 notebooks were located at his new residence, contending\n\nthat neither witness personally observed the notebooks there and\n\nthat there was little information that would help evaluate the\n\nwitnesses' reliability.   Moreover, Beckett complains that there\n\n\n\n     2\n      In Leon, the Court enumerated several other circumstances\nunder which application of the good faith exception is\ninappropriate. Id. at 923. None of them is relevant here.\n     3\n      In his brief, Beckett makes passing reference to an argument\nthat the affidavit in support of the search warrant failed to\nestablish probable cause that he had committed a crime. He did not\ndevelop this argument, however, but rather focused on the nexus\nelement of the test for probable cause. The government urges us to\nconsider the commission element argument waived. See United States\nv. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"We have\nsteadfastly deemed waived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory\nmanner, not accompanied by developed argumentation.\"). We need not\ndecide this, as St. Jacques's confession as well as other\ninformation in the affidavit provides ample support for probable\ncause to believe that Beckett had committed the murders.\n\n                              -11-\n\fwas no probable cause to believe that the firearm used in the 1995\n\nmurder would still be at his residence six years later.\n\n          We agree that the application's support of a nexus\n\nbetween evidence of the murders and Beckett's residence is less\n\nthan overwhelming. Considering the totality of the circumstances,\n\nhowever, we think that the affidavit established the nexus element\n\nsufficiently to pass muster under Leon.4     The record does not\n\ncontain any indication that the officers executing the warrant did\n\nso in bad faith, and the affidavit was not \"so lacking in indicia\n\nof probable cause as to render official belief in its existence\n\nentirely unreasonable.\"   See Leon, 468 U.S. at 923.   First, the\n\nunnamed witnesses' statements indicating that the notebooks had\n\nbeen moved to Beckett's current residence corroborate each other.\n\nSecond, the information that Beckett was a \"pack rat\" supported\n\nthe possibility that one or more of the specified search objects\n\nwould have been retained over the years and moved to Beckett's\n\ncurrent residence.   This is particularly true of the notebooks,\n\nwhich can reasonably be viewed as items created for preservation.5\n\nCf. United States v. Bucuvalas, 970 F.2d 937, 941 (1st Cir. 1992)\n\n\n     4\n      Accordingly, we need take no position on whether the warrant\napplication was supported by probable cause. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Owens, 167 F.3d 739, 744-45 (1st Cir. 1999) (bypassing\nprobable cause inquiry and affirming ruling on motion to suppress\nbased on Leon).\n     5\n      Indeed, the search yielded a notebook recording Beckett's\nwhereabouts in 1995, which was introduced into evidence at the\nhearing on Beckett's motion to suppress, but not at trial.\n\n                              -12-\n\f(abrogated on other grounds, Cleveland v. United States, 531 U.S.\n\n12 (2000) (business records created several years before search\n\nwere deemed to have \"enduring utility,\" thus supporting nexus\n\ndetermination)). Third, one unnamed witness personally viewed the\n\nnotebooks at Beckett's residence on High Street in Cumberland,\n\nwhere they had been moved from his earlier residence in Lincoln,\n\nand both unnamed witnesses indicated that Beckett later moved his\n\npersonal possessions to his current home at 58 Edgewood Drive.\n\nAccordingly, the officers could fairly infer that, having moved\n\nthe notebooks once, Beckett would have moved them also to his\n\ncurrent address.\n\n          Furthermore, although the six-year lag between the 1995\n\nmurder and the search somewhat diminishes the likelihood that\n\nBeckett would have retained the murder weapon, the fact that the\n\nbody of the victim was well-hidden could have alleviated the need\n\nto dispose of the weapon.     Cf. 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and\n\nSeizure § 3.7(d) (3d ed. 1996) (\"Where the object of the search is\n\na weapon used in the crime . . . the inference that the item[]\n\n[is] at the offender’s residence is especially compelling, at\n\nleast in those cases where the perpetrator is unaware that the\n\nvictim has been able to identify him to the police.\").        St.\n\nJacques's statement that Beckett retained the gun after the murder\n\nand the statements of several witnesses that Beckett regularly\n\ncarried a handgun lent further support.   Accordingly, we conclude\n\n\n                              -13-\n\fthat the officers were lawfully present in Beckett's residence\n\nunder Leon.\n\n           Beckett also argues that the search warrant was an\n\n\"indicia warrant\" seeking \"mere evidence\" of the murders rather\n\nthan \"fruits or instrumentalities\" of crime, heightening the\n\nstandard for probable cause.          We have long since abandoned the\n\nlegal distinction between mere evidence and instrumentalities. We\n\nnow   require   only   that   there     is    reason   to    believe     that    the\n\nparticular    evidence   to   be   seized      \"will   aid    in   a   particular\n\napprehension or conviction.\"       Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 301,\n\n307   (1967).      Here,      journal        entries   reflecting       Beckett’s\n\nwhereabouts or activities on or around the time of the murders\n\nwould have been of obvious evidentiary significance, especially in\n\nlight of St. Jacques's statement that Beckett was considering an\n\nalibi defense.\n\n           Finally, Beckett contends that even if the warrant was\n\nsupported by probable cause, it was overly broad and vague, thus\n\nconstituting an unconstitutional general warrant.                  He maintains\n\nthat the warrant \"gave the agents absolute discretion to search\n\nevery single piece of paper belonging to Mr. Beckett and [his\n\nfiancee] Tracy Carr.\"      We disagree.\n\n             The Fourth Amendment forbids general warrants so as to\n\nprevent   law   enforcement     officers        from   rummaging       through    an\n\nindividual's belongings at will.             Andresen v. Maryland, 427 U.S.\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\f463, 480 (1976).     Contrary to Beckett's contention, the warrant\n\ndid not provide the agents free rein to search all of his papers.\n\nIt was limited to paperwork relating to a .38 caliber pistol and\n\nnotebooks or personal papers recording the whereabouts of Beckett\n\nin 1992 and 1995.     That agents may have to perform some initial\n\nscreening to locate the particularized documents does not render\n\nthe warrant unconstitutional.\n\nB. Sufficiency of the evidence\n\n           Beckett also contends that he was entitled to acquittal\n\nbecause the government failed to prove that the sawed-off shotgun\n\nwas   covered   by   the   statute    under    which   he   was   convicted.\n\nSpecifically, he argues that there was insufficient evidence that\n\nthe sawed-off shotgun could \"readily be restored to fire\" as\n\nrequired by 26 U.S.C. § 5845(d).            We \"review all the evidence,\n\ndirect and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the\n\nprosecution, drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with the\n\nverdict, and avoiding credibility judgments, to determine whether\n\na rational jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"     United States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, 35 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 1030 (2001).\n\n           26 U.S.C. § 5861(d) provides, in relevant part, that\n\n\"[i]t shall be unlawful for any person . . . to receive or possess\n\na firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms\n\nRegistration and Transfer Record.\"          The term \"firearm\" includes,\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\finter alia, \"(1) a shotgun having a barrel . . . of less than 18\n\ninches in length; [and] (2) a weapon made from a shotgun if such\n\nweapon as modified has an overall length of less than 26 inches or\n\na barrel . . . of less than 18 inches in length.\"   Id. § 5845(a).\n\nThe statutory definition of a shotgun includes a \"weapon which may\n\nbe readily restored to fire a fixed shotgun shell.\"          Id. §\n\n5845(d).\n\n           A review of the trial record convinces us that the\n\ngovernment adduced sufficient evidence that the shotgun found\n\nduring the search of Beckett's residence satisfied the statutory\n\nrequirements. When officers searched Beckett’s garage, they found\n\nin a gun locker a substantially complete shotgun: it had a stock,\n\npistol grip and receiver, lacking only a barrel.      The officers\n\nfound the matching barrel elsewhere in the garage, within fifteen\n\nfeet of the gun locker.    The barrel had been cut down from its\n\noriginal length.   An agent was able to screw the sawed-off barrel\n\ninto the receiver portion of the gun without any difficulty in, at\n\nmost, a few minutes.   At trial, an agent demonstrated for the jury\n\nthat he could assemble the gun in less than thirty seconds.\n\nMoreover, prior to trial, the assembled sawed-off shotgun was\n\ntest-fired in a laboratory and determined to be functional.\n\n           Beckett bases his argument on a purported ambiguity in\n\nthe trial testimony of crime laboratory technician Edward Downing,\n\n\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fwho had performed the tests on the shotgun.               Downing testified as\n\nfollows:\n\n           Q. Do you know if that shotgun was measured at\n           your laboratory?\n\n           A. Yes, it was.\n\n           Q. And what are the dimensions of the weapon?\n\n           A. The overall length is 25 inches of Item 1,\n           and the barrel had been -- is a length of 14\n           and one quarter inches.\n\n           Q. Was that         weapon       test-fired     at     your\n           laboratory?\n\n           A.   The   item        was        test-fired       without\n           malfunction.\n\n           Q. Does that mean it fired?\n\n           A. That means it will fire.\n\n           Q. It worked?\n\n           A. Yes, sir.\n\nAny ambiguity as to the gun's hypothetical versus actual firing\n\ncapacity   in   the   answer    \"it   will     fire\"    was   resolved     in   the\n\nsubsequent exchange revealing that the shotgun \"worked.\" Taken as\n\na whole, Downing's testimony was sufficient to establish that the\n\nassembled sawed-off shotgun fired when tested. This testimony, in\n\nconjunction with the other evidence offered at trial, supported\n\nthe   jury's    conclusion     that   the     shotgun     found    at    Beckett's\n\nresidence could be \"readily restored to fire a fixed shotgun\n\nshell.\"    26 U.S.C. § 5845(d).\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f               As a final matter, we note that in his brief, Beckett\n\napparently relies on the definition of a firearm contained at 18\n\nU.S.C. § 921(a)(3): \"any weapon . . . which will or is designed to\n\nor may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of\n\nan explosive . . . .\"          As Beckett was tried under Title 26, not\n\nTitle    18,    only    the   former   provision's   requirements    must   be\n\nsatisfied.       In any event, the requirements of the two definitions\n\nare substantially similar; in this case, both are satisfied by the\n\nevidence presented at trial.\n\n               The district court, too, used language from Title 18 (as\n\nwell as from Title 26) in charging the jury.6           This may have been\n\ndue to the fact that the original indictment cited 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 922(j), which prohibits possession of a stolen firearm.                   At\n\ntrial,    this    was    dropped   from   the   indictment,   and   the   jury\n\nconsidered only the Title 26 charge.            The government points out,\n\nhowever, that the judgment of conviction below incorrectly states\n\nthat Beckett was convicted of violating both 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d)\n\nand 18 U.S.C. § 922(j).          Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and\n\nremand to the district court for the sole purpose of correcting\n\nthat error in the judgment of conviction.            We affirm the district\n\ncourt in all other respects.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      Beckett has waived any objection to these instructions by not\npresenting it below or on appeal.\n\n                                       -18-\n\f          For   the   foregoing    reasons,   we   AFFIRM   Beckett's\n\nconviction in part and VACATE and REMAND in part for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\f",

Police officers discovered the shotgun in plain view at Beckett's residence while executing a state court warrant seeking evidence of Beckett's involvement in two murders. Beckett now appeals from the denial of his pretrial motion to suppress the weapon and the denial of his motion for acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Procedural history</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 15, 2001, a Rhode Island magistrate issued a warrant permitting law enforcement to search Beckett's residence in Cumberland, Rhode Island. The search warrant authorized officers to search for (1) the weapon used in the second murder, a .38 caliber pistol; (2) paperwork and other items relating to a.38 caliber pistol; and (3) notebooks or personal papers \"recording the whereabouts\" of Beckett in 1992 and 1995, when the two murders occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The search warrant application included a seventeen-page affidavit detailing Beckett's alleged role as the triggerman in the two murders. The affidavit, which is described more thoroughly <i>infra,</i> recited the confession of James St. Jacques that he personally saw Beckett fire the rifle used in the first murder and the pistol used in the second murder, as well as statements from other witnesses, autopsy and ballistics evidence, and record checks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 16, 2001, federal and state officers executed the search warrant. In Beckett's garage, the sawed-off shotgun was discovered in plain view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 19, 2001, a federal grand jury in the District of Rhode Island returned a one-count indictment charging that on or about August 16, 2001, Beckett possessed a sawed-off shotgun in violation of 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5841, 5861(d), and 5871. On November 21, 2001, Beckett moved to suppress the shotgun, claiming that, inter alia, the search warrant was not supported by probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After hearing argument and taking evidence, the district court determined that there was probable cause justifying a search for a .38 caliber pistol and any paperwork relating to such a pistol.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> It stated that \"[d]espite the great length of time since the [second] murder was committed, there was still sufficient probable cause that the defendant committed the murder, and that he may well still have evidence which supports the criminal charge.\" Alternatively, the court held that the warrant came under the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule announced in <i>United States v. Leon,</i> 468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984): \"There's nothing to indicate that there was any bad faith here. And there was nothing that would indicate to any law enforcement officer that the warrant was so defective that no reasonable person would rely on that.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a two-day jury trial in March, 2002, Beckett was convicted of possessing the sawed-off shotgun, and on July 9, 2002, the court sentenced him to 33 months of imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Search warrant affidavit</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit in support of the search warrant application was signed by Donald R. Beech, a detective with the Pawtucket, Rhode Island Police Department. It stated the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 13, 1992, a jogger found the body of Robert J. Laforest in a wooded area in Smithfield, Rhode Island. An autopsy revealed that he had been shot four times with a .222 or .223 caliber gun. Laforest's mother reported that she had last seen him on August 11, 1992, when he said he was going to visit a friend named James St. Jacques.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 15, 2000, St. Jacques confessed that he had paid Beckett $15,000 to murder Laforest. St. Jacques explained that he used Paul Ferguson as an intermediary to negotiate the contract killing with Beckett, paying Ferguson $9,000 for his role as middleman. Beckett, who was then living in California, flew into Rhode Island shortly before the murder. St. Jacques and Ferguson met Beckett at the airport and took him to the Days Inn Hotel at India Point in Providence, where he stayed during the visit. On August 11, 1992, the day of the murder, Beckett drove St. Jacques's car to a wooded area in Smithfield, while St. Jacques remained at his own house. St. Jacques then phoned Laforest and accompanied him to the wooded area where Beckett was waiting. When Laforest got out of the truck, Beckett shot him several times with Laforest's AR 15 rifle (which had been left for safekeeping with St. Jacques). Later that day, St. Jacques took Beckett to the airport and gave him $7,500, the first half of the $15,000 fee. Ferguson, the middleman, delivered the remaining $7,500 to Beckett during an August 20, 1992 trip to California.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also on September 15, 2000, St. Jacques made an initial confession that three years after the murder of Laforest, Beckett also killed Ferguson. He said that between the two murders, Ferguson was talking too much about the Laforest murder and was demanding money from Beckett and St. Jacques. St. Jacques said that he saw Beckett twice on the day of Ferguson's murder, October 19, 1995: once early in the day, and again that night at a local bar. At the bar, Beckett told St. Jacques, \"I shot him and he will never be found.\" As reasons for killing Ferguson, Beckett complained to St. Jacques that Ferguson had told Beckett's former roommate that Beckett had killed a man in Rhode Island, and that this former roommate now was attempting to blackmail him. When Beckett later discovered that Ferguson's family had reported that Ferguson was last seen on Wednesday, October 18, 1995, the day before the murder actually took place, Beckett told St. Jacques that the family's inaccurate report had given him an alibi because Beckett was at work as a prison guard on October 18 and had taken the day off on October 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 1, 2001, investigators found Ferguson's body wrapped in plastic, buried five feet under a concrete slab in Rehoboth, Massachusetts, on property that had previously belonged to St. Jacques. An autopsy disclosed that Ferguson had been shot at least four times with a weapon \"consistent with a .380 caliber handgun (possibly a Llama brand).\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 3, 2001, two days after Ferguson's body was exhumed, St. Jacques elaborated on his earlier confession. This time, he said he had actually witnessed Beckett kill Ferguson and that he had helped him dispose of the body. According to St. Jacques, in October 1995, Beckett and Ferguson visited St. Jacques at his Rehoboth house. After Beckett accused Ferguson of \"shooting off his mouth,\" the two got into a fight. During the fight, Beckett pulled out a black semiautomatic handgun and shot Ferguson at least three times and struck him with the butt of the gun. Beckett and St. Jacques then wrapped Ferguson's body in plastic and dumped it into a hole that had been dug for a well. Beckett kept the gun after the murder. About a year and a half later, St. Jacques hired two men to pour concrete over the site, to make a foundation for a barn that was never built.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit set forth information corroborating multiple elements of St. Jacques's confession. As to the first murder, corroboration included St. Jacques's wife's personal observations of the first murder preparations; confirmation that Laforest owned an AR 15 rifle, which takes .223 caliber ammunition; records and witness statements concerning Beckett's travel from California and hotel stay; and confirmation of Ferguson's payment to Beckett in California. Corroboration of St. Jacques's account of the second murder included, inter alia, witnesses' confirmation of the alleged blackmail and dispute with Ferguson; Beckett's employment records showing that Beckett had been at work on October 18, 1995, and that he was off-duty on October 19, 1995; and several witnesses' statements that Beckett \"regularly carried a handgun.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the affidavit supporting the warrant application also addressed Beckett's record keeping. Records and witnesses indicated that by the time of the second murder, in October, 1995, Beckett resided in Lincoln, Rhode Island, and he worked as a guard at the Wyatt Correctional Facility. He was still employed at the prison at the time of the search. Beckett later moved to 783 High Street in Cumberland, Rhode Island, and then, at some point before the search, moved to 58 Edgewood Drive, also in Cumberland.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February, 2001, an \"ordinary citizen\" with no criminal record who had known Beckett for more than two years reported that he had been inside the 783 High Street address and was \"familiar with [Beckett's] habits and practices.\" The witness said that Beckett kept small \"spiral type\" notebooks in which he recorded \"his whereabouts including days worked and days off,\" that these notebooks dated back to 1992, and that the witness had seen one notebook in particular that \"records his whereabouts in 1995.\" The witness described Beckett as a \"`pack rat' who saves everything.\" The affidavit stated, \"Shortly after the witness saw these notebooks at the High Street address the witness became aware of the fact [that] Beckett had moved his personal possessions to his new home at 58 Edgewood Drive in Cumberland, Rhode Island.\" The witness also accurately described the outside of 58 Edgewood Drive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also in February, 2001, a second witness who had known Beckett for at least two years and was familiar with many of his habits reported that Beckett \"fastidiously recorded his whereabouts\" in a \"spiral type\" notebook that the witness had seen and that the witness was \"sure that the book reflects work schedules and days off for 1995.\" The affidavit stated, \"This witness indicated that the books along with other personal belongings have recently been moved to 58 Edgewood in Cumberland.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Probable cause</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sawed-off shotgun upon which Beckett's conviction was based was not within the scope of the search warrant. The government contends that it was lawfully seized, however, pursuant to the plain view doctrine. In <i>Horton v. California,</i> 496 U.S. 128, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 110 L.Ed.2d 112 (1990), the Supreme Court defined the contours of this doctrine, holding that \"an essential predicate to [the seizure of evidence not within a warrant's purview is] that the officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the place from which the evidence could be plainly viewed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 136, 110 S.Ct. 2301. We apply de novo review to the district court's ultimate conclusion that the elements of the doctrine have been satisfied. <i>United States v. Hamie,</i> 165 F.3d 80, 82 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beckett contends that the officers were not lawfully present in his residence when they discovered the shotgun because the search warrant was not supported by probable cause. A warrant application must demonstrate probable cause to believe that (1) a particular person has committed a crime (the \"commission\" element), and (2) enumerated evidence of the offense will be found at the place to be searched (the \"nexus\" element). <i>United States v. Zayas Diaz,</i> 95 F.3d 105, 110-11 (1st Cir.1996). In determining the sufficiency of an affidavit supporting a search warrant, we consider whether the \"totality of the circumstances\" stated in the affidavit demonstrates probable cause to search the premises. <i>United States v. Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d 279, 283 (1st Cir.1997). We examine the affidavit \"in a practical, common-sense fashion and accord considerable deference to reasonable inferences the [issuing judicial officer] may have drawn from the attested facts.\" <i>United States v. Barnard,</i> 299 F.3d 90, 93 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Zayas-Diaz,</i> 95 F.3d at 111) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In reviewing a denial of a suppression motion, the district court's ultimate legal conclusion, including the determination that a given set of facts constituted probable cause, is a question of law subject to de novo review.\" <i>Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d at 282 (<i>citing Ornelas v. United States,</i> 517 U.S. 690, 698-99, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). The district court's findings of historical fact are reviewed for clear error. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If probable cause is lacking, the evidence uncovered during the execution of the search warrant normally must be excluded from the case against the defendant. <i>United States v. Brunette,</i> 256 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir.2001). In <i>Leon,</i> the Supreme Court carved out an exception to the exclusionary rule, holding that \"evidence obtained in objectively reasonable reliance on a subsequently invalidated search warrant\" need not be suppressed. Suppression is still appropriate, however, if the warrant is based on an affidavit \"so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\" 468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. 3405 (quoting <i>Brown v. Illinois,</i> 422 U.S. 590, 610-611, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975) (Powell, J., concurring in part)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beckett's primary argument is that the search warrant failed to establish probable cause to believe that the items sought &#8212; the written records and the firearm &#8212; were located at his residence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> He takes issue with the supporting affidavit's reliance on the two unnamed informants who stated that the 1992 and 1995 notebooks were located at his new residence, contending that neither witness personally observed the notebooks there and that there was little information that would help evaluate the witnesses' reliability. Moreover, Beckett complains that there was no probable cause to believe that the firearm used in the 1995 murder would still be at his residence six years later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that the application's support of a nexus between evidence of the murders and Beckett's residence is less than overwhelming. Considering the totality of the circumstances, however, we think that the affidavit established the nexus element sufficiently to pass muster under <i>Leon.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The record does not contain any indication that the officers executing the warrant did so in bad faith, and the affidavit was not \"so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\" <i>See Leon,</i> 468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. 3405. First, the unnamed witnesses' statements indicating that the notebooks had been moved to Beckett's current residence corroborate each other. Second, the information that Beckett was a \"pack rat\" supported the possibility that one or more of the specified search objects would have been retained over the years and moved to Beckett's current residence. This is particularly true of the notebooks, which can reasonably be viewed as items created for preservation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Cf. United States v. Bucuvalas,</i> 970 F.2d 937, 941 (1st Cir. 1992) (abrogated on other grounds, <i>Cleveland v. United States,</i> 531 U.S. 12, 121 S.Ct. 365, 148 L.Ed.2d 221 (2000) (business records created several years before search were deemed to have \"enduring utility,\" thus supporting nexus determination)). Third, one unnamed witness personally viewed the notebooks at Beckett's residence on High Street in Cumberland, where they had been moved from his earlier residence in Lincoln, and both unnamed witnesses indicated that Beckett later moved his personal possessions to his current home at 58 Edgewood Drive. Accordingly, the officers could fairly infer that, having moved the notebooks once, Beckett would have moved them also to his current address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, although the six-year lag between the 1995 murder and the search somewhat diminishes the likelihood that Beckett would have retained the murder weapon, the fact that the body of the victim was well-hidden could have alleviated the need to dispose of the weapon. <i>Cf.</i> 2 Wayne R. LaFave, <i>Search and Seizure</i> &#167; 3.7(d) (3d ed. 1996) (\"Where the object of the search is a weapon used in the crime... the inference that the item[][is] at the offender's residence is especially compelling, at least in those cases where the perpetrator is unaware that the victim has been able to identify him to the police.\"). St. Jacques's statement that Beckett retained the gun after the murder and the statements of several witnesses that Beckett regularly carried a handgun lent further support. Accordingly, we conclude that the officers were lawfully present in Beckett's residence under <i>Leon.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beckett also argues that the search warrant was an \"indicia warrant\" seeking \"mere evidence\" of the murders rather than \"fruits or instrumentalities\" of crime, heightening the standard for probable cause. We have long since abandoned the legal distinction between mere evidence and instrumentalities. We now require only that there is reason to believe that the particular evidence to be seized \"will aid in a particular apprehension or conviction.\" <i>Warden v. Hayden,</i> 387 U.S. 294, 301, 307, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967). Here, journal entries reflecting Beckett's whereabouts or activities on or around the time of the murders would have been of obvious evidentiary significance, especially in light of St. Jacques's statement that Beckett was considering an alibi defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Beckett contends that even if the warrant was supported by probable cause, it was overly broad and vague, thus constituting an unconstitutional general warrant. He maintains that the warrant \"gave the agents absolute discretion to search every single piece of paper belonging to Mr. Beckett and [his fiancee] Tracy Carr.\" We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Amendment forbids general warrants so as to prevent law enforcement officers from rummaging through an individual's belongings at will. <i>Andresen v. Maryland,</i> 427 U.S. 463, 480, 96 S.Ct. 2737, 49 L.Ed.2d 627 (1976). Contrary to Beckett's contention, the warrant did not provide the agents free rein to search all of his papers. It was limited to paperwork relating to a .38 caliber pistol and notebooks or personal papers recording the whereabouts of Beckett in 1992 and 1995. That agents may have to perform some initial screening to locate the particularized documents does not render the warrant unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sufficiency of the evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beckett also contends that he was entitled to acquittal because the government failed to prove that the sawed-off shotgun was covered by the statute under which he was convicted. Specifically, he argues that there was insufficient evidence that the sawed-off shotgun could \"readily be restored to fire\" as required by 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(d). We \"review all the evidence, direct and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the prosecution, drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with the verdict, and avoiding credibility judgments, to determine whether a rational jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Baltas,</i> 236 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 532 U.S. 1030, 121 S.Ct. 1982, 149 L.Ed.2d 773 (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861(d) provides, in relevant part, that \"[i]t shall be unlawful for any person ... to receive or possess a firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.\" The term \"firearm\" includes, inter alia, \"(1) a shotgun having a barrel ... of less than 18 inches in length; [and] (2) a weapon made from a shotgun if such weapon as modified has an overall length of less than 26 inches or a barrel ... of less than 18 inches in length.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5845(a). The statutory definition of a shotgun includes a \"weapon which may be readily restored to fire a fixed shotgun shell.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5845(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of the trial record convinces us that the government adduced sufficient evidence that the shotgun found during the search of Beckett's residence satisfied the statutory requirements. When officers searched Beckett's garage, they found in a gun locker a substantially complete shotgun: it had a stock, pistol grip and receiver, lacking only a barrel. The officers found the matching barrel elsewhere in the garage, within fifteen feet of the gun locker. The barrel had been cut down from its original length. An agent was able to screw the sawed-off barrel into the receiver portion of the gun without any difficulty in, at most, a few minutes. At trial, an agent demonstrated for the jury that he could assemble the gun in less than thirty seconds. Moreover, prior to trial, the assembled sawed-off shotgun was test-fired in a laboratory and determined to be functional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beckett bases his argument on a purported ambiguity in the trial testimony of crime laboratory technician Edward Downing, who had performed the tests on the shotgun. Downing testified as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Do you know if that shotgun was measured at your laboratory?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Yes, it was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. And what are the dimensions of the weapon?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The overall length is 25 inches of Item 1, and the barrel had been &#8212; is a length of 14 and one quarter inches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Was that weapon test-fired at your laboratory?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The item was test-fired without malfunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. <i>Does that mean it fired?</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>That means it will fire.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. <i>It worked?</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Yes, sir.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any ambiguity as to the gun's hypothetical versus actual firing capacity in the answer \"it will fire\" was resolved in the subsequent exchange revealing that the shotgun \"worked.\" Taken as a whole, Downing's testimony was sufficient to establish that the assembled sawed-off shotgun fired when tested. This testimony, in conjunction with the other evidence offered at trial, supported the jury's conclusion that the shotgun found at Beckett's residence could be \"readily restored to fire a fixed shotgun shell.\" 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a final matter, we note that in his brief, Beckett apparently relies on the definition of a firearm contained at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(3): \"any weapon ... which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive....\" As Beckett was tried under Title 26, not Title 18, only the former provision's requirements must be satisfied. In any event, the requirements of the two definitions are substantially similar; in this case, both are satisfied by the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, too, used language from Title 18 (as well as from Title 26) in charging the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> This may have been due to the fact that the original indictment cited 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(j), which prohibits possession of a stolen firearm. At trial, this was dropped from the indictment, and the jury considered only the Title 26 charge. The government points out, however, that the judgment of conviction below incorrectly states that Beckett was convicted of violating both 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861(d) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(j). Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand to the district court for the sole purpose of correcting that error in the judgment of conviction. We affirm the district court in all other respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we <i>AFFIRM</i> Beckett's conviction in part and <i>VACATE and REMAND</i> in part for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court did not reach the issue of the validity of the warrant with regard to the notebooks</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In<i>Leon,</i> the Court enumerated several other circumstances under which application of the good faith exception is inappropriate. <i>Id.</i> at 923, 104 S.Ct. 3405.

He did not develop this argument, however, but rather focused on the nexus element of the test for probable cause. The government urges us to consider the commission element argument waived<i>See United States v. Bongiorno,</i> 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir.1997) (\"We have steadfastly deemed waived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not accompanied by developed argumentation.\").

Procedural history</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 15, 2001, a Rhode Island magistrate issued a warrant permitting law enforcement to search Beckett's residence in Cumberland, Rhode Island. The search warrant authorized officers to search for (1) the weapon used in the second murder, a .38 caliber pistol; (2) paperwork and other items relating to a.38 caliber pistol; and (3) notebooks or personal papers \"recording the whereabouts\" of Beckett in 1992 and 1995, when the two murders occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The search warrant application included a seventeen-page affidavit detailing Beckett's alleged role as the triggerman in the two murders. The affidavit, which is described more thoroughly <i>infra,</i> recited the confession of James St. Jacques that he personally saw Beckett fire the rifle used in the first murder and the pistol used in the second murder, as well as statements from other witnesses, autopsy and ballistics evidence, and record checks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 16, 2001, federal and state officers executed the search warrant.

Search warrant affidavit</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit in support of the search warrant application was signed by Donald R. Beech, a detective with the Pawtucket, Rhode Island Police Department. It stated the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 13, 1992, a jogger found the body of Robert J. Laforest in a wooded area in Smithfield, Rhode Island. An autopsy revealed that he had been shot four times with a .222 or .223 caliber gun. Laforest's mother reported that she had last seen him on August 11, 1992, when he said he was going to visit a friend named James St. Jacques.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 15, 2000, St. Jacques confessed that he had paid Beckett $15,000 to murder Laforest. St. Jacques explained that he used Paul Ferguson as an intermediary to negotiate the contract killing with Beckett, paying Ferguson $9,000 for his role as middleman. Beckett, who was then living in California, flew into Rhode Island shortly before the murder. St. Jacques and Ferguson met Beckett at the airport and took him to the Days Inn Hotel at India Point in Providence, where he stayed during the visit. On August 11, 1992, the day of the murder, Beckett drove St. Jacques's car to a wooded area in Smithfield, while St. Jacques remained at his own house. St. Jacques then phoned Laforest and accompanied him to the wooded area where Beckett was waiting. When Laforest got out of the truck, Beckett shot him several times with Laforest's AR 15 rifle (which had been left for safekeeping with St. Jacques). Later that day, St. Jacques took Beckett to the airport and gave him $7,500, the first half of the $15,000 fee. Ferguson, the middleman, delivered the remaining $7,500 to Beckett during an August 20, 1992 trip to California.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also on September 15, 2000, St. Jacques made an initial confession that three years after the murder of Laforest, Beckett also killed Ferguson. He said that between the two murders, Ferguson was talking too much about the Laforest murder and was demanding money from Beckett and St. Jacques. St. Jacques said that he saw Beckett twice on the day of Ferguson's murder, October 19, 1995: once early in the day, and again that night at a local bar. At the bar, Beckett told St. Jacques, \"I shot him and he will never be found.\" As reasons for killing Ferguson, Beckett complained to St. Jacques that Ferguson had told Beckett's former roommate that Beckett had killed a man in Rhode Island, and that this former roommate now was attempting to blackmail him. When Beckett later discovered that Ferguson's family had reported that Ferguson was last seen on Wednesday, October 18, 1995, the day before the murder actually took place, Beckett told St. Jacques that the family's inaccurate report had given him an alibi because Beckett was at work as a prison guard on October 18 and had taken the day off on October 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 1, 2001, investigators found Ferguson's body wrapped in plastic, buried five feet under a concrete slab in Rehoboth, Massachusetts, on property that had previously belonged to St. Jacques. An autopsy disclosed that Ferguson had been shot at least four times with a weapon \"consistent with a .380 caliber handgun (possibly a Llama brand).\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 3, 2001, two days after Ferguson's body was exhumed, St. Jacques elaborated on his earlier confession. This time, he said he had actually witnessed Beckett kill Ferguson and that he had helped him dispose of the body. According to St. Jacques, in October 1995, Beckett and Ferguson visited St. Jacques at his Rehoboth house. After Beckett accused Ferguson of \"shooting off his mouth,\" the two got into a fight. During the fight, Beckett pulled out a black semiautomatic handgun and shot Ferguson at least three times and struck him with the butt of the gun. Beckett and St. Jacques then wrapped Ferguson's body in plastic and dumped it into a hole that had been dug for a well. Beckett kept the gun after the murder.

Corroboration of St. Jacques's account of the second murder included, inter alia, witnesses' confirmation of the alleged blackmail and dispute with Ferguson; Beckett's employment records showing that Beckett had been at work on October 18, 1995, and that he was off-duty on October 19, 1995; and several witnesses' statements that Beckett \"regularly carried a handgun.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the affidavit supporting the warrant application also addressed Beckett's record keeping. Records and witnesses indicated that by the time of the second murder, in October, 1995, Beckett resided in Lincoln, Rhode Island, and he worked as a guard at the Wyatt Correctional Facility. He was still employed at the prison at the time of the search. Beckett later moved to 783 High Street in Cumberland, Rhode Island, and then, at some point before the search, moved to 58 Edgewood Drive, also in Cumberland.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February, 2001, an \"ordinary citizen\" with no criminal record who had known Beckett for more than two years reported that he had been inside the 783 High Street address and was \"familiar with [Beckett's] habits and practices.\" The witness said that Beckett kept small \"spiral type\" notebooks in which he recorded \"his whereabouts including days worked and days off,\" that these notebooks dated back to 1992, and that the witness had seen one notebook in particular that \"records his whereabouts in 1995.\" The witness described Beckett as a \"`pack rat' who saves everything.\" The affidavit stated, \"Shortly after the witness saw these notebooks at the High Street address the witness became aware of the fact [that] Beckett had moved his personal possessions to his new home at 58 Edgewood Drive in Cumberland, Rhode Island.\" The witness also accurately described the outside of 58 Edgewood Drive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also in February, 2001, a second witness who had known Beckett for at least two years and was familiar with many of his habits reported that Beckett \"fastidiously recorded his whereabouts\" in a \"spiral type\" notebook that the witness had seen and that the witness was \"sure that the book reflects work schedules and days off for 1995.\" The affidavit stated, \"This witness indicated that the books along with other personal belongings have recently been moved to 58 Edgewood in Cumberland.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Moreover, Beckett complains that there was no probable cause to believe that the firearm used in the 1995 murder would still be at his residence six years later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that the application's support of a nexus between evidence of the murders and Beckett's residence is less than overwhelming.

Second, the information that Beckett was a \"pack rat\" supported the possibility that one or more of the specified search objects would have been retained over the years and moved to Beckett's current residence. This is particularly true of the notebooks, which can reasonably be viewed as items created for preservation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Cf. United States v.

Third, one unnamed witness personally viewed the notebooks at Beckett's residence on High Street in Cumberland, where they had been moved from his earlier residence in Lincoln, and both unnamed witnesses indicated that Beckett later moved his personal possessions to his current home at 58 Edgewood Drive. Accordingly, the officers could fairly infer that, having moved the notebooks once, Beckett would have moved them also to his current address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, although the six-year lag between the 1995 murder and the search somewhat diminishes the likelihood that Beckett would have retained the murder weapon, the fact that the body of the victim was well-hidden could have alleviated the need to dispose of the weapon. <i>Cf.</i> 2 Wayne R. LaFave, <i>Search and Seizure</i> &#167; 3.7(d) (3d ed. 1996) (\"Where the object of the search is a weapon used in the crime... the inference that the item[][is] at the offender's residence is especially compelling, at least in those cases where the perpetrator is unaware that the victim has been able to identify him to the police.\"). St. Jacques's statement that Beckett retained the gun after the murder and the statements of several witnesses that Beckett regularly carried a handgun lent further support.

It was limited to paperwork relating to a .38 caliber pistol and notebooks or personal papers recording the whereabouts of Beckett in 1992 and 1995.

When officers searched Beckett's garage, they found in a gun locker a substantially complete shotgun: it had a stock, pistol grip and receiver, lacking only a barrel. The officers found the matching barrel elsewhere in the garage, within fifteen feet of the gun locker. The barrel had been cut down from its original length. An agent was able to screw the sawed-off barrel into the receiver portion of the gun without any difficulty in, at most, a few minutes. At trial, an agent demonstrated for the jury that he could assemble the gun in less than thirty seconds. Moreover, prior to trial, the assembled sawed-off shotgun was test-fired in a laboratory and determined to be functional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beckett bases his argument on a purported ambiguity in the trial testimony of crime laboratory technician Edward Downing, who had performed the tests on the shotgun.

This testimony, in conjunction with the other evidence offered at trial, supported the jury's conclusion that the shotgun found at Beckett's residence could be \"readily restored to fire a fixed shotgun shell.\" 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a final matter, we note that in his brief, Beckett apparently relies on the definition of a firearm contained at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(3): \"any weapon ... which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive....\" As Beckett was tried under Title 26, not Title 18, only the former provision's requirements must be satisfied. In any event, the requirements of the two definitions are substantially similar; in this case, both are satisfied by the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, too, used language from Title 18 (as well as from Title 26) in charging the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> This may have been due to the fact that the original indictment cited 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(j), which prohibits possession of a stolen firearm. At trial, this was dropped from the indictment, and the jury considered only the Title 26 charge. The government points out, however, that the judgment of conviction below incorrectly states that Beckett was convicted of violating both 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861(d) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(j). Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand to the district court for the sole purpose of correcting that error in the judgment of conviction. We affirm the district court in all other respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we <i>AFFIRM</i> Beckett's conviction in part and <i>VACATE and REMAND</i> in part for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court did not reach the issue of the validity of the warrant with regard to the notebooks</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In<i>Leon,</i> the Court enumerated several other circumstances under which application of the good faith exception is inappropriate. <i>Id.</i> at 923, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He did not develop this argument, however, but rather focused on the nexus element of the test for probable cause. The government urges us to consider the commission element argument waived<i>See United States v.
