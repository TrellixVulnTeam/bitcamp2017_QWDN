Plaintiff-appellant,   Dawn\n\nCaputo (\"Caputo\"), brought a six count complaint in the district\n\ncourt against her employers, The City of Haverhill; Fritz Esch,\n\nSchool Superintendent of Haverhill; and John Burruto (\"Burruto\"),\n\nPrincipal of Haverhill High School.        At the heart of this case is\n\nCaputo's allegation that the defendants discriminated against her\n\nbased on her gender.    The district court found that no reasonable\n\njury could reach such a conclusion and granted the defendant's\n\nmotion for summary judgment.      We affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n     Taken in the light most favorable to Caputo, MacGlashing v.\n\nDunlop Equip. Corp., 89 F.3d 932, 936 (1st Cir. 1996), the facts\n\nare as follows.     In 1994, Caputo was hired as head coach of\n\nHaverhill High School's boys and girls track team.       She maintained\n\nthis position until it was eliminated in September 1998.         Caputo\n\nexperienced great success as head coach.       Under her tutelage, the\n\nboys indoor track team won the State Championship for the first\n\ntime in Haverhill High School's history.\n\n     In July 1996, Martha Jamieson (\"Jamieson\") became Haverhill's\n\nnew athletic director.      Under Jamieson's direction, assistant\n\ncoaches were added to the track program.       According to Caputo, she\n\nwas \"extremely elated\" by this addition because the track \"program\n\nwas dramatically understaffed.\"\n\n     Beginning in the spring of 1997, Caputo began to have problems\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fwith her supervisors.            Caputo was reprimanded for allowing a\n\nstudent-athlete to practice without having completed the required\n\nphysical consent forms.         In June, Jamieson spoke to Caputo about a\n\nphone call Caputo placed to the home of the Brockton track coach,\n\nwhose team      had   recently    defeated      Haverhill          in   a    track   meet.\n\nAccording to Caputo, she told the coach's son that, \"if your dad\n\nhas   any   class,    he'll     give   the    trophy     back.\"         In    September,\n\nPrincipal     Burruto    disciplined         Caputo    for    writing        a   critical\n\nmemorandum about the cross country coach, Mike McGuire (\"McGuire\").\n\nDespite     Burruto's    warning,      Caputo's       comments      continued.          She\n\nrepeatedly made \"evaluative statements\" about McGuire to the cross\n\ncountry athletes, including telling them that she should have been\n\ntheir coach and that they would have achieved more success under\n\nher leadership.         Caputo also spoke to students and a newspaper\n\nreporter     about    McGuire    not   being     hired       for    the     position     of\n\nassistant indoor track coach.\n\n      Burruto met with Caputo in response to these incidents, but no\n\ndisciplinary action was taken.           In a memorandum dated December 12,\n\n1997, Burruto informed Caputo that her behavior was intolerable and\n\nif it persisted, she would be subjected to \"disciplinary action\n\nwhich   could    include      suspension,      or     even    dismissal          from   her\n\nemployment.\"\n\n      Caputo continued to make comments into 1998.                      In May, Caputo\n\ntold some of her physical education students that she would no\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\flonger be coaching the outdoor track team.                   When asked by her\n\nstudents if McGuire would be replacing her, Caputo told them that\n\nhe would not because he was \"not half the coach that [she] was.\"\n\nIn response to this incident, Burruto held a meeting with three\n\nstudents and questioned them about Caputo's comments.                      All three\n\nstudents   concurred       that   Caputo   was   speaking      negatively      about\n\nMcGuire.    Burruto then met with Caputo to discuss the matter, but\n\ntook no disciplinary action.\n\n       On September 16, 1998, Caputo met with both Jamieson and\n\nBurruto for a performance review.            Two written evaluations, dated\n\nNovember 12, 1997, and March 12, 1998, found \"unsatisfactory\" job\n\nratings.        Areas of improvement included \"professionalism with\n\ncolleagues,\"      and    \"professionalism     with   her     relationships      with\n\nstudent-athletes.\"         These same evaluations, however, commended\n\nCaputo for her work ethic and the time she invested in the track\n\nprogram.     Approximately ten percent of the other coaches also\n\nreceived \"unsatisfactory\" evaluations.\n\n       At this same meeting, Jamieson told Caputo about a plan to\n\nrestructure the track program which would eliminate the position of\n\nhead    track    coach.        The   new   track     program       would    resemble\n\napproximately sixty to seventy percent of the other schools in the\n\nMerrimack Valley Conference, of which Haverhill High School was a\n\nmember.    Jamieson explained that the program would be divided into\n\nfour parts,       with   one   coach   overseeing     each    of    the    following\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fprograms:     boys indoor track; girls indoor track; boys outdoor\n\ntrack; and girls outdoor track.            The impetus for the change was\n\nthat Haverhill had one of the largest track programs in the\n\nconference, but one of the smallest coaching staffs.\n\n      Although Caputo was \"shocked\" and \"devastated\" by the news,\n\nJamieson encouraged her to reapply for one of the new coaching\n\nappointments.     Shortly thereafter, Caputo was named head coach of\n\nthe   boys   indoor    track    team.     Before   hiring   her,   the    School\n\nSuperintendent of Haverhill had Caputo sign and agree to a list of\n\ncontingencies. These included agreeing to work professionally with\n\nother coaches and students, and refraining from criticizing fellow\n\nstaff   members   in    front    of   students.     After   signing      the    new\n\ncontract, Caputo was not subjected to any further discipline.                    At\n\nthe completion of the winter season, Caputo was hired as head coach\n\nof the boys outdoor track team.           This placed Caputo in charge of\n\ntwo of the four track teams.            As head coach of two teams, Caputo\n\nmade more money than she had when she was the head coach of the\n\nentire track team.      Caputo previously made $4,230 a season.                Now,\n\nCaputo earned $5,200 a season.\n\n      During the 1999 season, Caputo became outraged by Jamieson's\n\nand Burruto's handling of a disciplinary matter involving her \"best\n\nathlete.\"    Three eyewitnesses said they saw the athlete violently\n\npush another student. Caputo, however, and five other eyewitnesses\n\nwho observed the event from a different vantage point, claimed that\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fthere was no pushing.          Jamieson and Burruto did not believe\n\nCaputo's version of events and subsequently suspended the athlete.\n\nAs a result, the athlete could not compete in track meets over a\n\nten day holiday period. According to Caputo, this incident was the\n\n\"straw that broke the camel's back,\" and during a meeting with\n\nJamieson on April 26, 1999, Caputo announced her resignation.\n\nAfter Caputo resigned, Jamieson asked her to reconsider, but she\n\ndeclined.   Haverhill twice posted advertisements to fill Caputo's\n\npositions, although there is no evidence that the positions were\n\nactually filled.\n\n     Following her resignation, Caputo filed suit in the district\n\ncourt.      Caputo   alleged    that     the    defendants   violated   her\n\nconstitutional rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection\n\nClauses of the Fourteenth Amendment; discriminated against her\n\nbased on her gender in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000(e); and violated various state laws.\n\nThe defendants moved for summary judgment.            The district court\n\ngranted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the federal\n\nclaims and declined to exercise jurisdiction over the pendent state\n\nlaw claims.    On appeal, Caputo challenges the district court's\n\nruling on the federal gender discrimination claim, but not the due\n\nprocess or equal protection claims.            Caputo also challenges the\n\ndistrict court's failure to consider her state law claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fII.     DISCUSSION\n\n      We review a district court's entry of summary judgment de\n\nnovo.    Segrets, Inc. v. Gillman Knitwear Co., Inc., 207 F.3d 56, 61\n\n(1st Cir.     2000).       Summary   judgment   is   appropriate    when    \"the\n\npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the nonmoving party is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"            Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n        The primary issue in this case is whether Caputo lost her job\n\nbecause of gender discrimination.             In discrimination discharge\n\ncases, we apply the McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792\n\n(1973), burden shifting analysis.           The first step in the analysis\n\nrequires a plaintiff to establish a prima facie case.                 This is\n\naccomplished when a plaintiff shows that: (1) she is a member of a\n\nprotected class; (2) she was meeting the employer's legitimate\n\nemployment expectations; (3) she was actually or constructively\n\ndischarged; and (4) she was replaced by another individual of\n\nsimilar skills or qualifications, thereby confirming the employer's\n\ncontinued    need    for   equivalent   services.      See   Vega   v.     Kodak\n\nCaribbean, 3 F.3d 476, 479 (1st Cir. 1993).          The third prong is the\n\nportion of the prima facie case that is disputed by the parties and\n\nour discussion is focused accordingly.\n\n        A constructive discharge is a \"label for treatment so hostile\n\nor degrading that no reasonable employee would tolerate continuing\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fin the position.\"      Melendez-Arroyo v. Cutler-Hammer de P.R. Co.,\n\nInc., 273 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir. 2001).             The standard is an\n\nobjective one:      \"it cannot be triggered solely by the employee's\n\nsubjective beliefs, no matter how sincerely held.\" Marrero v. Goya\n\nof P.R., Inc., 304 F.3d 7, 28 (1st Cir. 2002).       When this standard\n\nis properly applied, it \"does not guarantee a workplace free from\n\nthe usual ebb and flow of power relationships and inter-office\n\npolitics.\"    Suarez v. Pueblo Intern, Inc., 229 F.3d 49, 54 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).      An injury to Caputo's \"ego or prestige does not\n\nfurnish a legally cognizable reason to treat a resignation as a\n\nconstructive discharge.\"       Id. at 55.\n\n     In the instant case, Caputo claims that she was forced to\n\nresign from her position due to hostile and degrading treatment.\n\nCaputo maintains that three pieces of evidence support her claim.\n\nFirst, Caputo says that she was treated in a hostile and degrading\n\nmanner when Jamieson and Burruto restructured the track program.\n\nA constructive discharge can arise from, among other things,\n\n\"reassignment with significantly diminished job responsibilities,\n\nor   a   decision    causing   a   significant   change   in   benefits.\"\n\nBurlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 761 (1998).\n\nHowever, \"a reduction in responsibility or a change in the way\n\nbusiness is done, unaccompanied by a diminution in salary or some\n\nother marked lessening of the quality of working conditions, does\n\nnot constitute a constructive discharge.\"        Suarez 229 F.3d at 55.\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f     There is no evidence that the restructured track program\n\nsignificantly     diminished   Caputo's   job   responsibilities     or   the\n\nquality of her working conditions. While the new program decreased\n\nthe number of students for which Caputo was responsible, her new\n\nposition left her in charge of two high school track teams:               the\n\nboys indoor and outdoor teams.     This is not a case where Caputo was\n\ndemoted from a supervisory position to one with little or no\n\nmanagerial responsibilities whatsoever.         Cf.    Melendez-Arroyo v.\n\nCutler-Hammer de P.R. Co., Inc., 273 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(employee was \"taken from a position of substantial responsibility\n\nsupervising a number of employees,\" and transferred to a job\n\ninvolving only \"sketchy menial\" tasks); Jirau-Bernal v. Agrait, 37\n\nF.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1994) (employee \"was transferred from a\n\nposition   with    supervisory   responsibility       for   more   than   200\n\nemployees, to a nonsupervisory position . . . .\").           Coaching these\n\ntwo particular track teams may have been less prestigious than\n\ncoaching just one team, but a loss of prestige is not sufficient,\n\nstanding alone, to support a finding of constructive discharge.\n\nSee Serrano-Cruz v. DFI P.R., Inc., 109 F.3d 23, 27 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n     Nor did Caputo suffer a reduction in salary.                  Id. at 26\n\n(\"Salary considerations are important in determining whether a job\n\ntransfer can support a claim of constructive dismissal.\").                 In\n\nfact, Caputo was making more money after the restructuring than she\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fhad been previously making. In short, the record before us reveals\n\nthat Caputo \"still retained duties and emoluments appropriate to\n\n[her] rank.\"      Suarez, F.3d at 55.           Therefore, we find that the\n\nrestructuring of the track program is not sufficient evidence of\n\nhostile   or    degrading     treatment        by   the    defendants    to   be   a\n\nconstructive discharge.\n\n     Caputo also claims that she was treated in a hostile and\n\ndegrading      manner    by   being    subjected      to    written     reprimands,\n\nunsatisfactory performance evaluations, and being asked to sign a\n\nlist of contingencies before she was able to accept her new\n\ncoaching position.        Caputo, however, admits to partaking in the\n\nunderlying behavior for which she was disciplined.                      Under such\n\ncircumstances,      we    cannot      say   that    Caputo    was     subjected    to\n\nobjectively hostile or degrading treatment.                 Being disciplined is\n\ncertainly unpleasant, but if Caputo wanted the reprimands to cease,\n\nshe simply could have complied with her employers' professional\n\nstandards.\n\n     Finally, Caputo cites the suspension of her best athlete as\n\nevidence of the defendants' hostile treatment towards her.                    There\n\nis simply no evidence in the record that this event adversely\n\naffected Caputo's job responsibilities or working conditions.                      We\n\ndo not think that an objectively reasonable coach would construe\n\nthe suspension of an athlete who violently pushed a fellow student\n\nas creating hostile working conditions so severe that she would\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\ffeel compelled to resign.\n\n       We       also   note    that   Caputo    was   asked     to   reconsider   her\n\nresignation, but refused to do so.                She resigned voluntarily.\n\n       In sum, we rule that Caputo failed to present a prima facie\n\ncase       of   gender   discrimination        because    the   restructured   track\n\nprogram, the written reprimands and unsatisfactory performance\n\nevaluations, and the suspension of a talented athlete do not\n\nconstitute a constructive discharge.                     We need not address the\n\nremaining steps in the McDonnell Douglas burden shifting analysis.1\n\nSummary judgment for the defendants was correctly granted.\n\n       We now briefly turn to whether the district court erred in not\n\ndeciding Caputo's pendent state law claims.                 Caputo addresses this\n\nmatter in the statement of issues section of her appellate brief,\n\nbut completely fails to subsequently argue it.                        The issue is\n\ntherefore waived.             See Brown v. Tr. of Brown Univ., 891 F.2d 337,\n\n352 (1st Cir. 1989) (issues not argued in brief are abandoned); see\n\nalso Fed. R. App. P. 28(a) (brief must contain statement of issues\n\n\n\n       1\n      While our above ruling ends the matter, we note further that\neven supposing error in granting summary judgement for failure to\npresent a prima facie case of discrimination, the defendants would\nstill prevail under the McDonnell Douglas framework.           The\ndefendants' decision to increase coaching supervision in the track\nprogram conformed with the prevailing practice at similar schools\nin the area.      Thus, the defendants presented a legitimate\nnondiscriminatory reason for their changes in the structure of the\ncoaching staff. Straughn v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 250 F.3d 23, 33-\n34 (1st Cir. 2001).      Caputo has presented no evidence even\nsuggesting, let alone demonstrating, that the defendants' reason\nfor changing her responsibilities was pretextual.\n\n                                         -11-\n\fpresented for review and argument with respect to such issues).\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\n     After viewing the record in the light most favorable to\n\nCaputo, we rule that she has not presented a prima facie case of\n\ngender discrimination.   Caputo also waived her argument regarding\n\nthe state law claims.     The district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment for the defendants is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f",

BACKGROUND\n\n     Taken in the light most favorable to Caputo, MacGlashing v.\n\nDunlop Equip. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196891\"><a href=\"/opinion/196891/macglashing-v-restoration/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 936 (1st Cir. 1996), the facts\n\nare as follows.     In 1994, Caputo was hired as head coach of\n\nHaverhill High School's boys and girls track team.       She maintained\n\nthis position until it was eliminated in September 1998.         Caputo\n\nexperienced great success as head coach.       Under her tutelage, the\n\nboys indoor track team won the State Championship for the first\n\ntime in Haverhill High School's history.\n\n     In July 1996, Martha Jamieson (\"Jamieson\") became Haverhill's\n\nnew athletic director.      Under Jamieson's direction, assistant\n\ncoaches were added to the track program.       According to Caputo, she\n\nwas \"extremely elated\" by this addition because the track \"program\n\nwas dramatically understaffed.\"\n\n     Beginning in the spring of 1997, Caputo began to have problems\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fwith her supervisors.            Caputo was reprimanded for allowing a\n\nstudent-athlete to practice without having completed the required\n\nphysical consent forms.         In June, Jamieson spoke to Caputo about a\n\nphone call Caputo placed to the home of the Brockton track coach,\n\nwhose team      had   recently    defeated      Haverhill          in   a    track   meet.\n\nAccording to Caputo, she told the coach's son that, \"if your dad\n\nhas   any   class,    he'll     give   the    trophy     back.\"         In    September,\n\nPrincipal     Burruto    disciplined         Caputo    for    writing        a   critical\n\nmemorandum about the cross country coach, Mike McGuire (\"McGuire\").\n\nDespite     Burruto's    warning,      Caputo's       comments      continued.          She\n\nrepeatedly made \"evaluative statements\" about McGuire to the cross\n\ncountry athletes, including telling them that she should have been\n\ntheir coach and that they would have achieved more success under\n\nher leadership.         Caputo also spoke to students and a newspaper\n\nreporter     about    McGuire    not   being     hired       for    the     position     of\n\nassistant indoor track coach.\n\n      Burruto met with Caputo in response to these incidents, but no\n\ndisciplinary action was taken.           In a memorandum dated December 12,\n\n1997, Burruto informed Caputo that her behavior was intolerable and\n\nif it persisted, she would be subjected to \"disciplinary action\n\nwhich   could    include      suspension,      or     even    dismissal          from   her\n\nemployment.\"\n\n      Caputo continued to make comments into 1998.                      In May, Caputo\n\ntold some of her physical education students that she would no\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\flonger be coaching the outdoor track team.                   When asked by her\n\nstudents if McGuire would be replacing her, Caputo told them that\n\nhe would not because he was \"not half the coach that [she] was.\"\n\nIn response to this incident, Burruto held a meeting with three\n\nstudents and questioned them about Caputo's comments.                      All three\n\nstudents   concurred       that   Caputo   was   speaking      negatively      about\n\nMcGuire.    Burruto then met with Caputo to discuss the matter, but\n\ntook no disciplinary action.\n\n       On September 16, 1998, Caputo met with both Jamieson and\n\nBurruto for a performance review.            Two written evaluations, dated\n\nNovember 12, 1997, and March 12, 1998, found \"unsatisfactory\" job\n\nratings.        Areas of improvement included \"professionalism with\n\ncolleagues,\"      and    \"professionalism     with   her     relationships      with\n\nstudent-athletes.\"         These same evaluations, however, commended\n\nCaputo for her work ethic and the time she invested in the track\n\nprogram.     Approximately ten percent of the other coaches also\n\nreceived \"unsatisfactory\" evaluations.\n\n       At this same meeting, Jamieson told Caputo about a plan to\n\nrestructure the track program which would eliminate the position of\n\nhead    track    coach.        The   new   track     program       would    resemble\n\napproximately sixty to seventy percent of the other schools in the\n\nMerrimack Valley Conference, of which Haverhill High School was a\n\nmember.    Jamieson explained that the program would be divided into\n\nfour parts,       with   one   coach   overseeing     each    of    the    following\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fprograms:     boys indoor track; girls indoor track; boys outdoor\n\ntrack; and girls outdoor track.            The impetus for the change was\n\nthat Haverhill had one of the largest track programs in the\n\nconference, but one of the smallest coaching staffs.\n\n      Although Caputo was \"shocked\" and \"devastated\" by the news,\n\nJamieson encouraged her to reapply for one of the new coaching\n\nappointments.     Shortly thereafter, Caputo was named head coach of\n\nthe   boys   indoor    track    team.     Before   hiring   her,   the    School\n\nSuperintendent of Haverhill had Caputo sign and agree to a list of\n\ncontingencies. These included agreeing to work professionally with\n\nother coaches and students, and refraining from criticizing fellow\n\nstaff   members   in    front    of   students.     After   signing      the    new\n\ncontract, Caputo was not subjected to any further discipline.                    At\n\nthe completion of the winter season, Caputo was hired as head coach\n\nof the boys outdoor track team.           This placed Caputo in charge of\n\ntwo of the four track teams.            As head coach of two teams, Caputo\n\nmade more money than she had when she was the head coach of the\n\nentire track team.      Caputo previously made $4,230 a season.                Now,\n\nCaputo earned $5,200 a season.\n\n      During the 1999 season, Caputo became outraged by Jamieson's\n\nand Burruto's handling of a disciplinary matter involving her \"best\n\nathlete.\"    Three eyewitnesses said they saw the athlete violently\n\npush another student. Caputo, however, and five other eyewitnesses\n\nwho observed the event from a different vantage point, claimed that\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fthere was no pushing.          Jamieson and Burruto did not believe\n\nCaputo's version of events and subsequently suspended the athlete.\n\nAs a result, the athlete could not compete in track meets over a\n\nten day holiday period. According to Caputo, this incident was the\n\n\"straw that broke the camel's back,\" and during a meeting with\n\nJamieson on April 26, 1999, Caputo announced her resignation.\n\nAfter Caputo resigned, Jamieson asked her to reconsider, but she\n\ndeclined.   Haverhill twice posted advertisements to fill Caputo's\n\npositions, although there is no evidence that the positions were\n\nactually filled.\n\n     Following her resignation, Caputo filed suit in the district\n\ncourt.      Caputo   alleged    that     the    defendants   violated   her\n\nconstitutional rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection\n\nClauses of the Fourteenth Amendment; discriminated against her\n\nbased on her gender in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000(e); and violated various state laws.\n\nThe defendants moved for summary judgment.            The district court\n\ngranted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the federal\n\nclaims and declined to exercise jurisdiction over the pendent state\n\nlaw claims.    On appeal, Caputo challenges the district court's\n\nruling on the federal gender discrimination claim, but not the due\n\nprocess or equal protection claims.            Caputo also challenges the\n\ndistrict court's failure to consider her state law claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fII.

R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n        The primary issue in this case is whether Caputo lost her job\n\nbecause of gender discrimination.

This is\n\naccomplished when a plaintiff shows that: (1) she is a member of a\n\nprotected class; (2) she was meeting the employer's legitimate\n\nemployment expectations; (3) she was actually or constructively\n\ndischarged; and (4) she was replaced by another individual of\n\nsimilar skills or qualifications, thereby confirming the employer's\n\ncontinued    need    for   equivalent   services.

While the new program decreased\n\nthe number of students for which Caputo was responsible, her new\n\nposition left her in charge of two high school track teams:               the\n\nboys indoor and outdoor teams.     This is not a case where Caputo was\n\ndemoted from a supervisory position to one with little or no\n\nmanagerial responsibilities whatsoever.         Cf.

Coaching these\n\ntwo particular track teams may have been less prestigious than\n\ncoaching just one team, but a loss of prestige is not sufficient,\n\nstanding alone, to support a finding of constructive discharge.\n\nSee Serrano-Cruz v. DFI P.R., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"738222\"><a href=\"/opinion/738222/digna-serrano-cruz-hector-irizarry-and-the-conjugal-society-comprised/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n     Nor did Caputo suffer a reduction in salary.                  Id. at 26\n\n(\"Salary considerations are important in determining whether a job\n\ntransfer can support a claim of constructive dismissal.\").                 In\n\nfact, Caputo was making more money after the restructuring than she\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fhad been previously making. In short, the record before us reveals\n\nthat Caputo \"still retained duties and emoluments appropriate to\n\n[her] rank.\"      Suarez, F.3d at 55.           Therefore, we find that the\n\nrestructuring of the track program is not sufficient evidence of\n\nhostile   or    degrading     treatment        by   the    defendants    to   be   a\n\nconstructive discharge.\n\n     Caputo also claims that she was treated in a hostile and\n\ndegrading      manner    by   being    subjected      to    written     reprimands,\n\nunsatisfactory performance evaluations, and being asked to sign a\n\nlist of contingencies before she was able to accept her new\n\ncoaching position.        Caputo, however, admits to partaking in the\n\nunderlying behavior for which she was disciplined.                      Under such\n\ncircumstances,      we    cannot      say   that    Caputo    was     subjected    to\n\nobjectively hostile or degrading treatment.                 Being disciplined is\n\ncertainly unpleasant, but if Caputo wanted the reprimands to cease,\n\nshe simply could have complied with her employers' professional\n\nstandards.\n\n     Finally, Caputo cites the suspension of her best athlete as\n\nevidence of the defendants' hostile treatment towards her.                    There\n\nis simply no evidence in the record that this event adversely\n\naffected Caputo's job responsibilities or working conditions.                      We\n\ndo not think that an objectively reasonable coach would construe\n\nthe suspension of an athlete who violently pushed a fellow student\n\nas creating hostile working conditions so severe that she would\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\ffeel compelled to resign.\n\n       We       also   note    that   Caputo    was   asked     to   reconsider   her\n\nresignation, but refused to do so.                She resigned voluntarily.\n\n       In sum, we rule that Caputo failed to present a prima facie\n\ncase       of   gender   discrimination        because    the   restructured   track\n\nprogram, the written reprimands and unsatisfactory performance\n\nevaluations, and the suspension of a talented athlete do not\n\nconstitute a constructive discharge.                     We need not address the\n\nremaining steps in the McDonnell Douglas burden shifting analysis.1\n\nSummary judgment for the defendants was correctly granted.\n\n       We now briefly turn to whether the district court erred in not\n\ndeciding Caputo's pendent state law claims.                 Caputo addresses this\n\nmatter in the statement of issues section of her appellate brief,\n\nbut completely fails to subsequently argue it.                        The issue is\n\ntherefore waived.             See Brown v. Tr. of Brown Univ., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n352 (1st Cir. 1989) (issues not argued in brief are abandoned); see\n\nalso Fed. R. App. P. 28(a) (brief must contain statement of issues\n\n\n\n       1\n      While our above ruling ends the matter, we note further that\neven supposing error in granting summary judgement for failure to\npresent a prima facie case of discrimination, the defendants would\nstill prevail under the McDonnell Douglas framework.           The\ndefendants' decision to increase coaching supervision in the track\nprogram conformed with the prevailing practice at similar schools\nin the area.      Thus, the defendants presented a legitimate\nnondiscriminatory reason for their changes in the structure of the\ncoaching staff. Straughn v.

CONCLUSION\n\n     After viewing the record in the light most favorable to\n\nCaputo, we rule that she has not presented a prima facie case of\n\ngender discrimination.   Caputo also waived her argument regarding\n\nthe state law claims.     The district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment for the defendants is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f</pre>",
