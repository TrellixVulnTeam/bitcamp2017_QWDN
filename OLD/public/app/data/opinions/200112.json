Appellant Donald Dolinger\n\nseeks to set aside a district court judgment which dismissed the\n\nhabeas corpus petition in which he claimed that his criminal\n\nconvictions for child rape under Massachusetts law were obtained in\n\nviolation of the Confrontation Clause. See U.S. Const. amends. VI,\n\nXIV.       We affirm the district court judgment.\n\n                                         I\n\n                                    BACKGROUND\n\n               The   record    on   appeal   reflects   that   in   early    1993\n\nDolinger's      putative      fourteen-year-old    victim   (\"Jonathan      Doe\")1\n\nallegedly had begun having oral and anal intercourse three to four\n\ntimes a week with an even younger boy.            During the summer of 1993,\n\nDolinger's wife, Robin, complained to Jonathan Doe's mother that\n\nJonathan had kissed the Dolinger's minor daughter, yet there is no\n\nevidence that Dolinger himself ever learned of the alleged \"kissing\n\nincident.\"\n\n               Dolinger and Jonathan Doe met for the first time in the\n\nfall of 1993, when Dolinger hired Doe to assist him with various\n\nmaintenance      and   renovation      jobs.      Shortly   thereafter,     as   a\n\n\"Christmas gift,\" Dolinger hired a female prostitute to perform\n\nfellatio on Jonathan, who subsequently told Dolinger that he had\n\nnot enjoyed the experience because he was \"bisexual.\"               During the\n\n\n\n       1\n      The pseudonym \"Jonathan Doe\" is used simply to protect the\nidentity of the victim.\n\n                                         2\n\fensuing months, Dolinger and Doe mutually engaged in acts of\n\nfellatio.       On one such occasion, Dolinger inquired whether Doe\n\nwould allow Dolinger to \"poke\" him.           Upon being asked by Doe what\n\n\"poke\" meant, Dolinger explained: \"That's where I put my penis in\n\nyour bum.\"       Although Doe verbally agreed, he soon began to cry,\n\ntelling Dolinger to stop because it hurt.              Dolinger initially\n\nrefused, then relented.\n\n              Early in 1994, Dolinger made a remark which caused\n\nJonathan to cry, though by the time of the March 1996 trial\n\nJonathan could not recall what Dolinger had said which upset him.\n\nAt about the same time, Jonathan's mother reported to her therapist\n\nthat Jonathan's behavior had become belligerent and erratic.\n\n              Following the ensuing police investigation, eleven counts\n\nof child rape were lodged against Dolinger.           See Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nAnn. ch. 265, § 23.2      At trial, the defense contended that Dolinger\n\nhad   never     engaged   in   any   sexual    relations   with   Jonathan.3\n\nAdditionally, in an effort to impeach the trial testimony of the\n\nthen seventeen-year-old Jonathan — to the effect that he was\n\nsexually naive at the time of the rapes, viz., unfamiliar with such\n\nconcepts as \"bisexuality,\" \"oral sex,\" and \"anal sex\" — Dolinger\n\n\n\n      2\n      The Massachusetts child-rape statute makes it a crime\n\"unlawfully [to] ha[ve] sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual\nintercourse, and abuse[] a child under sixteen years of age.\"\nMass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 265, § 23.\n      3\n          Dolinger elected not to testify.\n\n                                      3\n\funsuccessfully     sought     to   adduce       evidence    regarding      Jonathan's\n\nearlier homosexual relationship with the younger boy.                      Citing the\n\nMassachusetts rape-shield statute, Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 233, §\n\n21B,4 the trial court ruled that, whatever its relevance, the\n\nproffered     evidence    was      \"well       overshadowed    .   .   .    [by   its]\n\nprejudicial effect.\"          Ultimately, the jury convicted Dolinger on\n\neight of the eleven child-rape charges.\n\n             On direct appeal, Dolinger contended that the trial\n\ncourt's evidentiary ruling infringed his Sixth Amendment right to\n\ncross-examine     Doe    in   order   to       test   the   credibility     of    Doe's\n\n\n     4\n         The Massachusetts rape-shield statute provides, in pertinent\npart:\n\n             Evidence of the reputation of a victim's\n             sexual conduct shall not be admissible in any\n             investigation or proceeding before a grand\n             jury or any court of the commonwealth for a\n             violation of [Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 265, §\n             23]. Evidence of specific instances of a\n             victim's    sexual   conduct   in    such   an\n             investigation or proceeding shall not be\n             admissible except evidence of the victim's\n             sexual conduct with the defendant or evidence\n             of recent conduct of the victim alleged to be\n             the   cause    of   any   physical    feature,\n             characteristic, or condition of the victim;\n             provided, however, that such evidence shall be\n             admissible only after an in camera hearing on\n             a written motion for admission of same and an\n             offer of proof. If, after said hearing, the\n             court finds that the weight and relevancy of\n             said evidence is sufficient to outweigh its\n             prejudicial effect to the victim, the evidence\n             shall be admitted; otherwise not.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 233, § 21B.\n\n\n                                           4\n\ftestimony to the effect that he had been sexually naive in 1993-94\n\nwhen the alleged rapes occurred.             Dolinger reasons that had the\n\njury determined that Doe lied regarding his naiveté, it may also\n\nhave found that Doe was fabricating the central trial testimony\n\nthat he had been raped by Dolinger.\n\n           In due course, the Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed\n\nthe Dolinger convictions.         See Commonwealth v. Dolinger, No. 97-P-\n\n558 (Mass. App. Ct. Mar. 6, 1998) (unpublished opinion). First, it\n\nrejected Dolinger's contention that the excluded evidence would\n\nhave explained how Doe had acquired his sexual knowledge, thereby\n\naffirming the trial court observations that (i) \"it strain[ed]\n\ncredulity that a fifteen-year old wouldn't know about anal and oral\n\nsex,\" and (ii) Doe's \"consensual\" homosexual relationship with the\n\nyounger boy bore little similarity to Doe's relationship with\n\nDolinger. Id. at 2 (citing Commonwealth v. Ruffen, 507 N.E.2d 684,\n\n687-88   (Mass.    1987)   (\"If    the   [ten-year-old]     victim   had     been\n\nsexually abused in the past in a manner similar to the abuse in the\n\ninstant case, such evidence would be admissible at trial because it\n\nis relevant on the issue of the victim's knowledge about sexual\n\nmatters.\") (emphasis added)).\n\n           Second, the Appeals Court rejected Dolinger's contention\n\nthat,    even     assuming    fifteen-year-olds       normally       would     be\n\nknowledgeable     regarding       the    sexual   matters   at   issue,       the\n\nprosecution had gone out of its way to portray Doe as a sexual\n\n\n                                         5\n\fneophyte before the jury.    In addition, the Appeals Court noted\n\nthat the jury had not been invited to infer that Doe either\n\npossessed \"unusual knowledge or [an] unusual lack of knowledge\n\nabout sex.\"   Id. at 3.\n\n          Moreover, the Appeals Court rejected Dolinger's claim\n\nthat the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the\n\nrelevance of the excluded evidence was not outweighed by its\n\npotential prejudice to Doe, particularly since the evidence of\n\nDoe's prior homosexual relationship with the younger boy tended\n\ndirectly to undermine Doe's overall credibility regarding his\n\nsexual naiveté (e.g., Doe's testimony that he did not understand\n\nwhat Dolinger had meant by the word \"poke\"), thereby inviting the\n\njury to infer that Doe may have fabricated the rape charges against\n\nDolinger as well.     Finally, the Appeals Court ruled that the\n\nprosecution had not attempted to establish that Doe was sexually\n\nnaive, but merely that he was \"an emotionally and financially needy\n\nchild,\" and, in addition, that Dolinger had been able to present\n\nother   impeachment   evidence   to   the   jury,   viz.,   Doe's   prior\n\ninconsistent statements that (i) Dolinger had raped him every day,\n\nand (ii) Dolinger had raped him only on the eleven occasions\n\nalleged in the indictment.   Id. at 4 & n.3.\n\n          After the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court summarily\n\nrejected the Dolinger application for further appellate review, see\n\nCommonwealth v. Dolinger, 695 N.E.2d 667 (1998), the United States\n\n\n                                  6\n\fDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts denied the ensuing\n\npetition for habeas corpus relief, see 28 U.S.C. § 2254, then\n\nissued its certificate of appealability.\n\n                                 II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n\n          The district court order denying the petition for habeas\n\ncorpus is subject to de novo review.   See Almanzar v. Maloney, 281\n\nF.3d 300, 303 (1st Cir. 2002).   Additionally, Dolinger is entitled\n\nto relief only if we determine that the adverse decisions reached\n\nby the Commonwealth courts were \"contrary to, or involved an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"   28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d)(1).5\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      Dolinger also contends on appeal that the determinations of\nfact made by the Commonwealth courts were unreasonable. See 28\nU.S.C. § 2254(d)(2) (requiring habeas relief where state court\nissues decision \"based on an unreasonable determination of the\nfacts in light of the evidence presented\"). But see Mastracchio v.\nVose, 274 F.3d 590, 598 (1st Cir. 2001) (noting that findings of\nfact made by state courts are entitled to a presumption of\ncorrectness which can be rebutted only by \"clear and convincing\"\nevidence); 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e).     Subsection 2254(d)(2) applies\nexclusively to determinations of \"'basic, primary, or historical\nfacts,'\" however, Sanna v. Dipaolo, 265 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2001)\n(citation omitted), not to mixed questions of fact and law, which\nare more amenable to analysis under section 2254(d)(1). See Ouber\nv. Guarino, 293 F.3d 19, 27 (1st Cir. 2002). Since the issue as to\nwhether the trial court violated Dolinger's rights under the\nConfrontation Clause presents a mixed question of law and fact,\nsee, e.g., Wilkerson v. Cain, 233 F.3d 886, 890 (5th Cir. 2000), we\nneed not address the Dolinger contention predicated on subsection\n2254(d)(2).\n\n                                 7\n\f               \"Under the 'contrary to' clause, a federal habeas court\n\nmay grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion\n\nopposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of\n\nlaw or if the state court decides a case differently than [the\n\nSupreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\n\nUnder the 'unreasonable application' clause, a federal habeas court\n\nmay grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct\n\ngoverning legal principle from [the Supreme] Court's decisions but\n\nunreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's\n\ncase.\"    Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412-13 (2000).\n\n               The parties are in agreement that Olden v. Kentucky, 488\n\nU.S.     227    (1988),   provides   the   controlling   Supreme   Court\n\nconfrontation-clause precedent.       Olden, an African-American male,\n\nwas charged with sodomizing a white female.          During trial, the\n\ncourt rejected an evidentiary proffer by the defense — viz., that\n\nthe alleged victim was living with another African-American male at\n\nthe time of trial — notwithstanding the victim's inconsistent trial\n\ntestimony that she had been living with her mother.      Id. at 229-30.\n\nDespite the impeachment value inherent in the defense proffer, the\n\ntrial court reasoned that the jury might harbor a racial bias which\n\ncould prompt it unfairly to hold the victim's current interracial\n\nrelationship against her.       Id. at 232.\n\n               The Supreme Court reversed the Olden conviction, id. at\n\n233, explaining that \"[w]hile a trial court may, of course, impose\n\n\n                                     8\n\freasonable limits on defense counsel's inquiry into the potential\n\nbias of a prosecution witness, to take account of such factors as\n\n'harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness'\n\nsafety,    or     interrogation      that        [would    be]    repetitive     or    only\n\nmarginally relevant,' the limitation here was beyond reason, [and\n\namounted to] [s]peculation as to the effect of jurors' racial\n\nbiases.\"      Id. at 232; see also Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S.\n\n673,    679   (1986)      (\"'[T]he      Confrontation          Clause   guarantees       an\n\nopportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination\n\nthat is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the\n\ndefense might wish.'\") (citation omitted).                        Further, the Supreme\n\nCourt concluded that the erroneous evidentiary ruling was not\n\nharmless.       Olden, 488 U.S. at 233.\n\n              Turning now to the \"contrary to\" clause in 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2254(d)(1), we cannot conclude that the Appeals Court came to \"a\n\nconclusion opposite to that reached by [the United States Supreme]\n\nCourt   on    a   question      of   law    or     .   .   .     decide[d]    [the]    case\n\ndifferently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially\n\nindistinguishable facts.\"            Williams, 529 U.S. at 412-13.                   For one\n\nthing, although the legal rule announced in Olden delineates a\n\nnonexclusive       list    of   criteria         which     may    inform     trial    court\n\nevidentiary       rulings       under      the     Confrontation        Clause       (e.g.,\n\nharassment), these criteria are not susceptible to bright-line\n\ndefinition, but rather require that the trial court apply a case-\n\n\n                                             9\n\fand-fact-specific balancing test.              Furthermore, as our case\n\nsummary   demonstrates,   the     facts   in    Olden   are   in   no    sense\n\n\"materially indistinguishable\" from those in the present case. For\n\ninstance, Olden asserted the defense of consent, whereas no such\n\ndefense is available under the Massachusetts child-rape statute,\n\nsee supra note 2, and unlike the Dolinger proffer, the Olden\n\nproffer was not barred by the state rape-shield law.\n\n           As the Appeals Court \"identifie[d] the correct governing\n\nlegal principle from [the Supreme] Court's decisions,\" we need only\n\ninquire as to whether it \"unreasonably applie[d] that principle to\n\nthe facts.\"    Williams, 529 U.S. at 412-13.          It is clear that the\n\nAppeals   Court   appropriately    focused     its   determination      on   the\n\ncomponents of the Olden analysis most pertinent to the Dolinger\n\nproffer excluded below, by balancing (i) its degree of relevance;\n\n(ii) its potential to cause unfair prejudice to Doe; and (iii) the\n\nextent to which the proffer was repetitive or duplicative of other\n\navailable impeachment evidence.\n\nA. Relevance\n\n           On appeal, Dolinger contends that the proffer made before\n\nthe trial court was relevant to (i) whether Jonathan Doe perjured\n\nhimself when he testified that he had been sexually naive in 1993-\n\n94, thus making it more likely that he had fabricated the child\n\nrape accusations as well; (ii) whether Doe wanted revenge against\n\nDolinger, who in early 1994 angrily had confronted him about the\n\n\n                                    10\n\f\"kissing incident\" involving Dolinger's minor daughter; and (iii)\n\nwhether Doe was sufficiently sophisticated to understand that\n\nDolinger would be arrested and prosecuted if Doe were falsely to\n\naccuse Dolinger of child rape.\n\n           Like    the    trial   court,        the    Appeals    Court     reasonably\n\nrecognized that this evidence was relevant to impeach Jonathan Doe\n\non the issue relating to his sexual naiveté.                    Dolinger, No. 97-P-\n\n558, at 4 (Mass. App. Ct. Mar. 6, 1998) (\"[Doe's] testimony\n\ndisplays a certain unsureness about oral and anal sex, and . . .\n\ntestimony as to [Doe's] prior acts with another might have the\n\ntendency   to   impeach    the    witness.\").           Doe     testified    that,   in\n\nDecember 1993, when Dolinger asked whether he had enjoyed his\n\nexperience with the female prostitute, Doe replied that he had not,\n\nbecause he thought he was bisexual.              Similarly, Doe testified that\n\nhe did not understand what Dolinger meant by the term \"poke,\" and\n\nhad not understood it until Dolinger defined it for him.                     See supra\n\nat p. 3.\n\n           On     the    other    hand,        the    Appeals     Court     reasonably\n\ndiscounted the relevance of the proffer relating to the \"revenge\"\n\ntheory as propounded by Dolinger.                    First, although the defense\n\nmaintained that Dolinger had confronted Doe in early 1994 about the\n\n\"kissing incident,\" Doe testified that he could not remember the\n\nreason for the confrontation.                  More importantly, Doe's prior\n\nhomosexual relationship with a younger boy at most would tend to\n\n\n                                          11\n\fshow Doe's precocious understanding regarding sexual mechanics,\n\nrather than demonstrate his awareness that an allegation that an\n\nadult had raped a child could be used as a weapon of revenge.\n\nDolinger, No. 97-P-558, at 5 (Mass. App. Ct. Mar. 6, 1998).\n\n            Accordingly, we conclude that the Commonwealth courts\n\nappropriately    evaluated   the    materiality    and   relevance   of   the\n\nDolinger proffer.\n\nB.   Prejudice\n\n            Next, Dolinger contends that (i) the Massachusetts rape-\n\nshield statute precludes evidence of a victim's predisposition to\n\nsexual promiscuity, unless independently relevant to the victim's\n\nbiases, see Commonwealth v. O.C Houston, 722 N.E.2d 942, 945 (Mass.\n\n2000); and (ii) in all events the protections afforded under the\n\nrape-shield statute cannot trump the Confrontation Clause.\n\n            The Appeals Court recognized that the analyses required\n\nunder Olden and the Massachusetts rape-shield statute are not\n\nincompatible, but rather that each requires a similar balancing of\n\ncompeting    factors.    The       rape-shield    statute   establishes    a\n\nrebuttable presumption that evidence of a victim's alleged sexual\n\npromiscuity would be prejudicial to the rape victim, see Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws Ann. ch. 233, § 21B (\"Evidence of the reputation of a victim's\n\nsexual conduct shall not be admissible . . . provided, however,\n\nthat such evidence shall be admissible only after an in camera\n\nhearing [at which] . . . the court finds that the weight and\n\n\n                                     12\n\frelevancy     of   said      evidence       is   sufficient    to     outweigh       its\n\nprejudicial effect to the victim.\"), since it seriously intrudes\n\nupon his privacy and threatens to permit the jury unfairly to\n\nextrapolate, from the victim's prior consensual sexual acts, his\n\nconsensual participation in the crime charged.                  See Houston, 722\n\nN.E.2d at 945; see also Michigan v. Lucas, 500 U.S. 145, 149 (1991)\n\n(holding that rape-shield evidentiary exclusions are not per se\n\nSixth Amendment violations, because, depending on the facts of the\n\ncase,   an   exclusion       may    serve    legitimate   State       interests       in\n\nprotecting victim); Stephens v. Miller, 13 F.3d 998, 1002 (7th Cir.\n\n1994) (observing that rape victims \"deserve heightened protection\n\nagainst . . . unnecessary invasions of privacy\"); cf. Fed. R. Evid.\n\n412.\n\n             Echoing      the      rape-shield      statute,        Olden    likewise\n\ncontemplates that the trial court should weigh factors such as the\n\npotential    for   \"harassment,        prejudice,     [and]    confusion       of    the\n\nissues.\"     Olden,    488      U.S.   at    232.    Thus,     it    is     hardly   an\n\nunreasonable application of Olden to conclude, in light of the\n\npotential for substantial jury confusion, that trial courts should\n\nfirst find compelling reasons before setting aside the presumption\n\nof nonadmissibility, particularly where, as here, the prejudice and\n\nharassing cross-examination proffered is to be inflicted upon a\n\nvictim who is a minor. Accord, e.g., Quinn v. Haynes, 234 F.3d 837,\n\n850 (4th Cir. 2000) (observing that state court appropriately\n\n\n                                            13\n\fconsidered minor victim's age and emotional susceptibility in\n\ndetermining whether to admit evidence of prior sexual conduct).\n\nC.   Redundancy\n\n            Dolinger maintains that no redundancy would have resulted\n\nhad the trial court admitted his excluded proffer along with the\n\nother impeachment evidence.        He contends that (i) Doe's motive to\n\nframe him, by way of revenge, was not strongly established by the\n\nother evidence admitted in the trial court — i.e., that Dolinger\n\nhad confronted Doe in early 1994 regarding the \"kissing incident\"\n\n— since Doe testified that he could not remember what Dolinger had\n\nsaid to him during that confrontation, and the jury therefore could\n\ninfer no concrete motive for Doe's revenge; and (ii) evidence that\n\nDoe previously had told his counselor that Dolinger raped him every\n\nday, instead of on the eleven occasions charged in the indictment,\n\nmerely demonstrated       Doe's   predisposition     to   exaggerate   facts,\n\nrather than a predisposition to fabricate events (i.e., the rapes)\n\nout of whole cloth.   On the other hand, however, given the level of\n\nprejudice    threatened    by     the    Dolinger   proffer,   it   was   not\n\nunreasonable for the state courts to determine that Dolinger had\n\nbeen accorded an adequate opportunity to challenge Doe's bias and\n\ntruthfulness in other meaningful ways.\n\n            First, whether or not the \"kissing incident\" constituted\n\nthe motive for Doe's alleged revenge is largely immaterial.               The\n\njury was presented with evidence that Dolinger had confronted Doe\n\n\n                                        14\n\fangrily a few days before Doe made the rape accusations, and in\n\nfact had made Doe cry.   We think that this evidence, if accepted by\n\nthe jury, was itself sufficient to support the defense theory that\n\nDoe had framed Dolinger out of revenge.     See, e.g., Stephens, 13\n\nF.3d at 1002 (noting that the defendant adduced evidence that \"he\n\nsaid something to [his victim] that angered her and caused her to\n\nfabricate the attempted rape charge,\" but trial court properly\n\nexcluded further lurid details of the victim's past sexual conduct\n\n\"to avoid embarrassing her and subjecting her to possible public\n\ndenigration\").\n\n          Second, as concerns the prior inconsistent statement by\n\nDoe, in the present context we perceive no significant distinction\n\nbetween Doe's predispositions to exaggerate and to lie, since each\n\nstrongly suggests his tendency to speak untruthfully:       whether\n\nregarding the occurrence of the rapes or their frequency. Thus, we\n\nconclude that it was not beyond the realm of reason for the\n\nCommonwealth courts to determine that the Dolinger proffer was\n\nlargely cumulative.6\n\n\n     6\n      Of course, Confrontation Clause claims are subject to\n\"harmless error\" analysis as well. See Olden, 488 U.S. at 232:\n\n          \"The correct inquiry is whether, assuming that\n          the     damaging     potential      of     the\n          cross-examination [or excluded evidence] were\n          fully realized, a reviewing court might\n          nonetheless say that the error was harmless\n          beyond a reasonable doubt. Whether such error\n          is harmless in a particular case depends upon\n          a host of factors, all readily accessible to\n\n                                 15\n\f           Under section 2254(d)(1), it is immaterial whether we\n\nwould assess the Olden factors as the Commonwealth courts have done\n\nin the instant case had we been directly presented with these\n\nissues in a non-habeas context.         Of necessity, a balancing test\n\nnormally occasions an exercise of the trial court's informed\n\ndiscretion.   See Domaingue v. MacDonald, 978 F. Supp. 53, 58 (D.\n\nMass. 1997) (upholding discretionary exclusion of evidence of\n\nincest victim's alleged prior sexual promiscuity, given that trial\n\ncourt otherwise afforded defendant \"a reasonable opportunity to\n\nquestion the witness' veracity and motivation,\" and to present \"a\n\nreasonably complete picture of the witness's bias\") (citing United\n\nStates v. LaBoy-Delgado, 84 F.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir. 1996)).         Thus, it\n\nis sufficient that we are able to conclude that the Commonwealth\n\ncourts \"identifie[d] the correct governing legal principle from\n\n[the   Supreme]   Court's   decisions    [viz.,   the   Olden   factors],\"\n\n\"appl[ied] that principle to the facts of the . . . case,\" and\n\nreasonably balanced the competing factors.        Williams, 529 U.S. at\n\n412-13.\n\n\n           reviewing courts. These factors include the\n           importance of the witness' testimony in the\n           prosecution's case, whether the testimony was\n           cumulative, the presence or absence of\n           evidence corroborating or contradicting the\n           testimony of the witness on material points,\n           the extent of cross-examination otherwise\n           permitted, and, of course, the overall\n           strength of the prosecution's case.\"\n\nId. at 232-33 (citation omitted) (emphasis added).\n\n                                  16\n\fAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n            17\n\f",

During the summer of 1993, Dolinger's wife, Robin, complained to Jonathan Doe's mother that Jonathan had kissed the Dolinger's minor daughter, yet there is no evidence that Dolinger himself ever learned of the alleged \"kissing incident.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dolinger and Jonathan Doe met for the first time in the fall of 1993, when Dolinger hired Doe to assist him with various maintenance and renovation jobs. Shortly thereafter, as a \"Christmas gift,\" Dolinger hired a female prostitute to perform fellatio on Jonathan, who subsequently told Dolinger that he had not enjoyed the experience because he was \"bisexual.\" During the ensuing months, Dolinger and Doe mutually engaged in acts of fellatio. On one such occasion, Dolinger inquired whether Doe would allow Dolinger to \"poke\" him. Upon being asked by Doe what \"poke\" meant, Dolinger explained: \"That's where I put my penis in your bum.\" Although Doe verbally agreed, he soon began to cry, telling Dolinger to stop because it hurt. Dolinger initially refused, then relented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in 1994, Dolinger made a remark which caused Jonathan to cry, though by the time of the March 1996 trial Jonathan could not recall what Dolinger had said which upset him. At about the same time, Jonathan's mother reported to her therapist that Jonathan's behavior had become belligerent and erratic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the ensuing police investigation, eleven counts of child rape were lodged against Dolinger. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 265, &#167; 23.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> At trial, the defense contended that Dolinger had never engaged in any sexual relations with Jonathan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Additionally, in an effort to impeach the trial testimony of the then seventeen-year-old Jonathan &#8212; to the effect that he was sexually naive at the time of the rapes, <i>viz.,</i> unfamiliar with such concepts as \"bisexuality,\" \"oral sex,\" and \"anal sex\" &#8212; Dolinger unsuccessfully sought to adduce evidence regarding Jonathan's earlier homosexual relationship with the younger boy. Citing the Massachusetts rape-shield statute, Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 233, &#167; 21B,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the trial court ruled that, whatever its relevance, the proffered evidence was \"well overshadowed ... [by its] prejudicial effect.\" Ultimately, the jury convicted Dolinger on eight of the eleven child-rape charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct appeal, Dolinger contended that the trial court's evidentiary ruling infringed his Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine Doe in order to test the credibility of Doe's testimony to the effect that he had been sexually naive in 1993-94 when the alleged rapes occurred. Dolinger reasons that had the jury determined that Doe lied regarding his naivet&#233;, it may also have found that Doe was fabricating the central trial testimony that he had been raped by Dolinger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed the Dolinger convictions. <i>See Commonwealth v. Dolinger,</i> No. 97-P-558 (Mass.App.Ct. March 6, 1998) (unpublished opinion). First, it rejected Dolinger's contention that the excluded evidence would have explained how Doe had acquired his sexual knowledge, thereby affirming the trial court observations that (i) \"it strain[ed] credulity that a fifteen-year old wouldn't know about anal and oral sex,\" and (ii) Doe's \"consensual\" homosexual relationship with the younger boy bore little similarity to Doe's relationship with Dolinger. <i>Id.</i> at 2 (citing <i>Commonwealth v. Ruffen,</i> 399 Mass. 811, 507 N.E.2d 684, 687-88 (Mass.1987) (\"If the [<i>ten-year-old</i>] victim had been <i>sexually abused in the past</i> in a manner similar to the abuse in the instant case, such evidence would be admissible at trial because it is relevant on the issue of the victim's knowledge about sexual matters.\") (emphasis added)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Appeals Court rejected Dolinger's contention that, even assuming fifteen-year-olds normally would be knowledgeable regarding the sexual matters at issue, the prosecution had gone out of its way to portray Doe as a sexual neophyte before the jury. In addition, the Appeals Court noted that the jury had not been invited to infer that Doe either possessed \"unusual knowledge or [an] unusual lack of knowledge about sex.\" <i>Id.</i> at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the Appeals Court rejected Dolinger's claim that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the relevance of the excluded evidence was not outweighed by its potential prejudice to Doe, particularly since the evidence of Doe's prior homosexual relationship with the younger boy tended directly to undermine Doe's overall credibility regarding his sexual naivet&#233; (<i>e.g.,</i> Doe's testimony that he did not understand what Dolinger had meant by the word \"poke\"), thereby inviting the jury to infer that Doe may have fabricated the rape charges against Dolinger as well. Finally, the Appeals Court ruled that the prosecution had not attempted to establish that Doe was sexually naive, but merely that he was \"an emotionally and financially needy child,\" and, in addition, that Dolinger had been able to present other impeachment evidence to the jury, <i>viz.,</i> Doe's prior inconsistent statements that (i) Dolinger had raped him every day, and (ii) Dolinger had raped him only on the eleven occasions alleged in the indictment. <i>Id.</i> at 4 &amp; n. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court summarily rejected the Dolinger application for further appellate review, <i>see Commonwealth v. Dolinger,</i> 427 Mass. 1104, 695 N.E.2d 667 (1998), the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts denied the ensuing petition for habeas corpus relief, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254, then issued its certificate of appealability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court order denying the petition for habeas corpus is subject to <i>de novo</i> review. <i>See Almanzar v. Maloney,</i> 281 F.3d 300, 303 (1st Cir.2002). Additionally, Dolinger is entitled to relief only if we determine that the adverse decisions reached by the Commonwealth courts were \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Under the `contrary to' clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts. Under the `unreasonable application' clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme] Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case.\" <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties are in agreement that <i>Olden v. Kentucky,</i> 488 U.S. 227, 109 S.Ct. 480, 102 L.Ed.2d 513 (1988), provides the controlling Supreme Court confrontation-clause precedent. Olden, an African-American male, was charged with sodomizing a white female. During trial, the court rejected an evidentiary proffer by the defense &#8212; <i>viz.,</i> that the alleged victim was living with another African-American male at the time of trial &#8212; notwithstanding the victim's inconsistent trial testimony that she had been living with her mother. <i>Id.</i> at 229-30, 109 S.Ct. 480. Despite the impeachment value inherent in the defense proffer, the trial court reasoned that the jury might harbor a racial bias which could prompt it unfairly to hold the victim's current interracial relationship against her. <i>Id.</i> at 232, 109 S.Ct. 480.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court reversed the Olden conviction, <i>id.</i> at 233, 109 S.Ct. 480, explaining that \"[w]hile a trial court may, of course, impose reasonable limits on defense counsel's inquiry into the potential bias of a prosecution witness, to take account of such factors as `harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness' safety, or interrogation that [would be] repetitive or only marginally relevant,' the limitation here was beyond reason, [and amounted to] [s]peculation as to the effect of jurors' racial biases.\" <i>Id.</i> at 232, 109 S.Ct. 480; <i>see also Delaware v. Van Arsdall,</i> 475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) (\"`[T]he Confrontation Clause guarantees an <i>opportunity</i> for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.'\") (citation omitted). Further, the Supreme Court concluded that the erroneous evidentiary ruling was not harmless. <i>Olden,</i> 488 U.S. at 233, 109 S.Ct. 480.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning now to the \"contrary to\" clause in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1), we cannot conclude that the Appeals Court came to \"a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the United States Supreme] Court on a question of law or ... decide[d][the] case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\" <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495. For one thing, although the legal rule announced in <i>Olden</i> delineates a nonexclusive list of criteria which may inform trial court evidentiary rulings under the Confrontation Clause (<i>e.g.,</i> harassment), these criteria are not susceptible to brightline definition, but rather require that the trial court apply a case-and-fact-specific balancing test. Furthermore, as our case summary demonstrates, the facts in <i>Olden</i> are in no sense \"materially indistinguishable\" from those in the present case. For instance, Olden asserted the defense of consent, whereas no such defense is available under the Massachusetts child-rape statute, <i>see supra</i> note 2, and unlike the Dolinger proffer, the <i>Olden</i> proffer was not barred by the state rape-shield law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Appeals Court \"identifie[d] the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme] Court's decisions,\" we need only inquire as to whether it \"unreasonably applie[d] that principle to the facts.\" <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495. It is clear that the Appeals Court appropriately focused its determination on the components of the <i>Olden</i> analysis most pertinent to the Dolinger proffer excluded below, by balancing (i) its degree of relevance; (ii) its potential to cause unfair prejudice to Doe; and (iii) the extent to which the proffer was repetitive or duplicative of other available impeachment evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Relevance</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Dolinger contends that the proffer made before the trial court was relevant to (i) whether Jonathan Doe perjured himself when he testified that he had been sexually naive in 1993-94, thus making it more likely that he had fabricated the child rape accusations as well; (ii) whether Doe wanted revenge against Dolinger, who in early 1994 angrily had confronted him about the \"kissing incident\" involving Dolinger's minor daughter; and (iii) whether Doe was sufficiently sophisticated to understand that Dolinger would be arrested and prosecuted if Doe were falsely to accuse Dolinger of child rape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the trial court, the Appeals Court reasonably recognized that this evidence was relevant to impeach Jonathan Doe on the issue relating to his sexual naivet&#233;. <i>Dolinger,</i> No. 97-P-558, at 4 (Mass.App. Ct. Mar.6, 1998) (\"[Doe's] testimony displays a certain unsureness about oral and anal sex, and ... testimony as to [Doe's] prior acts with another might have the tendency to impeach the witness.\"). Doe testified that, in December 1993, when Dolinger asked whether he had enjoyed his experience with the female prostitute, Doe replied that he had not, because he thought he was bisexual. Similarly, Doe testified that he did not understand what Dolinger meant by the term \"poke,\" and had not understood it until Dolinger defined it for him. <i>See supra</i> at p. 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the Appeals Court reasonably discounted the relevance of the proffer relating to the \"revenge\" theory as propounded by Dolinger. First, although the defense maintained that Dolinger had confronted Doe in early 1994 about the \"kissing incident,\" Doe testified that he could not remember the reason for the confrontation. More importantly, Doe's prior homosexual relationship with a younger boy at most would tend to show Doe's precocious understanding regarding sexual mechanics, rather than demonstrate his awareness that an allegation that an adult had raped a child could be used as a weapon of revenge. <i>Dolinger,</i> No. 97-P-558, at 5 (Mass.App.Ct. Mar.6, 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Commonwealth courts appropriately evaluated the materiality and relevance of the Dolinger proffer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Prejudice</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Dolinger contends that (i) the Massachusetts rape-shield statute precludes evidence of a victim's predisposition to sexual promiscuity, <i>unless independently relevant to the victim's biases, see Commonwealth v. O.C Houston,</i> 430 Mass. 616, 722 N.E.2d 942, 945 (Mass.2000); and (ii) in all events the protections afforded under the rape-shield statute cannot trump the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Appeals Court recognized that the analyses required under <i>Olden</i> and the Massachusetts rape-shield statute are not incompatible, but rather that each requires a similar balancing of competing factors. The rape-shield statute establishes a rebuttable presumption that evidence of a victim's alleged sexual promiscuity would be prejudicial to the rape victim, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 233, &#167; 21B (\"Evidence of the reputation of a victim's sexual conduct shall not be admissible ... provided, however, that such evidence shall be admissible only after an in camera hearing [at which] ... the court finds that the weight and relevancy of said evidence is sufficient to outweigh its prejudicial effect to the victim.\"), since it seriously intrudes upon his privacy and threatens to permit the jury unfairly to extrapolate, from the victim's prior consensual sexual acts, his consensual participation in the crime charged. <i>See Houston,</i> 722 N.E.2d at 945; <i>see also Michigan v. Lucas,</i> 500 U.S. 145, 149, 111 S.Ct. 1743, 114 L.Ed.2d 205 (1991) (holding that rape-shield evidentiary exclusions are not <i>per se</i> Sixth Amendment violations, because, depending on the facts of the case, an exclusion may serve legitimate State interests in protecting victim); <i>Stephens v. Miller,</i> 13 F.3d 998, 1002 (7th Cir.1994) (observing that rape victims \"deserve heightened protection against ... unnecessary invasions of privacy\"); <i>cf.</i> Fed.R.Evid. 412.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Echoing the rape-shield statute, <i>Olden</i> likewise contemplates that the trial court should weigh factors such as the potential for \"harassment, prejudice, [and] confusion of the issues.\" <i>Olden,</i> 488 U.S. at 232, 109 S.Ct. 480. Thus, it is hardly an unreasonable application of <i>Olden</i> to conclude, in light of the potential for substantial jury confusion, that trial courts should first find compelling reasons before setting aside the presumption of nonadmissibility, particularly where, as here, the prejudice and harassing cross-examination proffered is to be inflicted upon a victim who is a minor. <i>Accord, e.g., Quinn v. Haynes,</i> 234 F.3d 837, 850 (4th Cir.2000) (observing that state court appropriately considered minor victim's age and emotional susceptibility in determining whether to admit evidence of prior sexual conduct).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Redundancy</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dolinger maintains that no redundancy would have resulted had the trial court admitted his excluded proffer <i>along with</i> the other impeachment evidence. He contends that (i) Doe's motive to frame him, by way of revenge, was not strongly established by the other evidence admitted in the trial court &#8212; i.e., that Dolinger had confronted Doe in early 1994 regarding the \"kissing incident\" &#8212; since Doe testified that he could not remember what Dolinger had said to him during that confrontation, and the jury therefore could infer no concrete motive for Doe's revenge; and (ii) evidence that Doe previously had told his counselor that Dolinger raped him every day, instead of on the eleven occasions charged in the indictment, merely demonstrated Doe's predisposition to exaggerate facts, rather than a predisposition to fabricate events (i.e., the rapes) out of whole cloth. On the other hand, however, given the level of prejudice threatened by the Dolinger proffer, it was not unreasonable for the state courts to determine that Dolinger had been accorded an <i>adequate opportunity</i> to challenge Doe's bias and truthfulness <i>in other meaningful ways.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, whether or not the \"kissing incident\" constituted the motive for Doe's alleged revenge is largely immaterial. The jury was presented with evidence that Dolinger had confronted Doe angrily a few days before Doe made the rape accusations, and in fact had made Doe cry. We think that this evidence, if accepted by the jury, was itself sufficient to support the defense theory that Doe had framed Dolinger out of revenge. <i>See, e.g., Stephens,</i> 13 F.3d at 1002 (noting that the defendant adduced evidence that \"he said something to [his victim] that angered her and caused her to fabricate the attempted rape charge,\" but trial court properly excluded further lurid details of the victim's past sexual conduct \"to avoid embarrassing her and subjecting her to possible public denigration\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as concerns the prior inconsistent statement by Doe, in the present context we perceive no significant distinction between Doe's predispositions to exaggerate and to lie, since each strongly suggests his tendency to speak untruthfully: whether regarding the occurrence of the rapes or their frequency. Thus, we conclude that it was not beyond the realm of reason for the Commonwealth courts to determine that the `Dolinger proffer was largely cumulative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under section 2254(d)(1), it is immaterial whether we would assess the <i>Olden</i> factors as the Commonwealth courts have done in the instant case had we been directly presented with these issues in a non-habeas context. Of necessity, a balancing test normally occasions an exercise of the trial court's informed discretion. <i>See Domaingue v. MacDonald,</i> 978 F.Supp. 53, 58 (D.Mass.1997) (upholding discretionary exclusion of evidence of incest victim's alleged prior sexual promiscuity, given that trial court otherwise afforded defendant \"a reasonable opportunity to question the witness' veracity and motivation,\" and to present \"a reasonably complete picture of the witness's bias\") (citing <i>United States v. Laboy-Delgado,</i> 84 F.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir.1996)). Thus, it is sufficient that we are able to conclude that the Commonwealth courts \"identifie[d] the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme] Court's decisions [<i>viz.,</i> the <i>Olden</i> factors],\" \"appl[ied] that principle to the facts of the ... case,\" and reasonably balanced the competing factors. <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>AFFIRMED.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The pseudonym \"Jonathan Doe\" is used simply to protect the identity of the victim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Massachusetts child-rape statute makes it a crime \"unlawfully [to] ha[ve] sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse, and abuse[] a child under sixteen years of age.\" Mass.

During the summer of 1993, Dolinger's wife, Robin, complained to Jonathan Doe's mother that Jonathan had kissed the Dolinger's minor daughter, yet there is no evidence that Dolinger himself ever learned of the alleged \"kissing incident.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dolinger and Jonathan Doe met for the first time in the fall of 1993, when Dolinger hired Doe to assist him with various maintenance and renovation jobs. Shortly thereafter, as a \"Christmas gift,\" Dolinger hired a female prostitute to perform fellatio on Jonathan, who subsequently told Dolinger that he had not enjoyed the experience because he was \"bisexual.\" During the ensuing months, Dolinger and Doe mutually engaged in acts of fellatio. On one such occasion, Dolinger inquired whether Doe would allow Dolinger to \"poke\" him. Upon being asked by Doe what \"poke\" meant, Dolinger explained: \"That's where I put my penis in your bum.\" Although Doe verbally agreed, he soon began to cry, telling Dolinger to stop because it hurt. Dolinger initially refused, then relented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in 1994, Dolinger made a remark which caused Jonathan to cry, though by the time of the March 1996 trial Jonathan could not recall what Dolinger had said which upset him. At about the same time, Jonathan's mother reported to her therapist that Jonathan's behavior had become belligerent and erratic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the ensuing police investigation, eleven counts of child rape were lodged against Dolinger. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 265, &#167; 23.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> At trial, the defense contended that Dolinger had never engaged in any sexual relations with Jonathan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Additionally, in an effort to impeach the trial testimony of the then seventeen-year-old Jonathan &#8212; to the effect that he was sexually naive at the time of the rapes, <i>viz.,</i> unfamiliar with such concepts as \"bisexuality,\" \"oral sex,\" and \"anal sex\" &#8212; Dolinger unsuccessfully sought to adduce evidence regarding Jonathan's earlier homosexual relationship with the younger boy. Citing the Massachusetts rape-shield statute, Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 233, &#167; 21B,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the trial court ruled that, whatever its relevance, the proffered evidence was \"well overshadowed ... [by its] prejudicial effect.\" Ultimately, the jury convicted Dolinger on eight of the eleven child-rape charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct appeal, Dolinger contended that the trial court's evidentiary ruling infringed his Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine Doe in order to test the credibility of Doe's testimony to the effect that he had been sexually naive in 1993-94 when the alleged rapes occurred. Dolinger reasons that had the jury determined that Doe lied regarding his naivet&#233;, it may also have found that Doe was fabricating the central trial testimony that he had been raped by Dolinger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed the Dolinger convictions. <i>See Commonwealth v. Dolinger,</i> No. 97-P-558 (Mass.App.Ct. March 6, 1998) (unpublished opinion). First, it rejected Dolinger's contention that the excluded evidence would have explained how Doe had acquired his sexual knowledge, thereby affirming the trial court observations that (i) \"it strain[ed] credulity that a fifteen-year old wouldn't know about anal and oral sex,\" and (ii) Doe's \"consensual\" homosexual relationship with the younger boy bore little similarity to Doe's relationship with Dolinger. <i>Id.</i> at 2 (citing <i>Commonwealth v.

In addition, the Appeals Court noted that the jury had not been invited to infer that Doe either possessed \"unusual knowledge or [an] unusual lack of knowledge about sex.\" <i>Id.</i> at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the Appeals Court rejected Dolinger's claim that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the relevance of the excluded evidence was not outweighed by its potential prejudice to Doe, particularly since the evidence of Doe's prior homosexual relationship with the younger boy tended directly to undermine Doe's overall credibility regarding his sexual naivet&#233; (<i>e.g.,</i> Doe's testimony that he did not understand what Dolinger had meant by the word \"poke\"), thereby inviting the jury to infer that Doe may have fabricated the rape charges against Dolinger as well. Finally, the Appeals Court ruled that the prosecution had not attempted to establish that Doe was sexually naive, but merely that he was \"an emotionally and financially needy child,\" and, in addition, that Dolinger had been able to present other impeachment evidence to the jury, <i>viz.,</i> Doe's prior inconsistent statements that (i) Dolinger had raped him every day, and (ii) Dolinger had raped him only on the eleven occasions alleged in the indictment. <i>Id.</i> at 4 &amp; n. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court summarily rejected the Dolinger application for further appellate review, <i>see Commonwealth v.

For one thing, although the legal rule announced in <i>Olden</i> delineates a nonexclusive list of criteria which may inform trial court evidentiary rulings under the Confrontation Clause (<i>e.g.,</i> harassment), these criteria are not susceptible to brightline definition, but rather require that the trial court apply a case-and-fact-specific balancing test. Furthermore, as our case summary demonstrates, the facts in <i>Olden</i> are in no sense \"materially indistinguishable\" from those in the present case. For instance, Olden asserted the defense of consent, whereas no such defense is available under the Massachusetts child-rape statute, <i>see supra</i> note 2, and unlike the Dolinger proffer, the <i>Olden</i> proffer was not barred by the state rape-shield law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Appeals Court \"identifie[d] the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme] Court's decisions,\" we need only inquire as to whether it \"unreasonably applie[d] that principle to the facts.\" <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 412-13, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is clear that the Appeals Court appropriately focused its determination on the components of the <i>Olden</i> analysis most pertinent to the Dolinger proffer excluded below, by balancing (i) its degree of relevance; (ii) its potential to cause unfair prejudice to Doe; and (iii) the extent to which the proffer was repetitive or duplicative of other available impeachment evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Relevance</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Dolinger contends that the proffer made before the trial court was relevant to (i) whether Jonathan Doe perjured himself when he testified that he had been sexually naive in 1993-94, thus making it more likely that he had fabricated the child rape accusations as well; (ii) whether Doe wanted revenge against Dolinger, who in early 1994 angrily had confronted him about the \"kissing incident\" involving Dolinger's minor daughter; and (iii) whether Doe was sufficiently sophisticated to understand that Dolinger would be arrested and prosecuted if Doe were falsely to accuse Dolinger of child rape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the trial court, the Appeals Court reasonably recognized that this evidence was relevant to impeach Jonathan Doe on the issue relating to his sexual naivet&#233;. <i>Dolinger,</i> No. 97-P-558, at 4 (Mass.App. Ct. Mar.6, 1998) (\"[Doe's] testimony displays a certain unsureness about oral and anal sex, and ... testimony as to [Doe's] prior acts with another might have the tendency to impeach the witness.\"). Doe testified that, in December 1993, when Dolinger asked whether he had enjoyed his experience with the female prostitute, Doe replied that he had not, because he thought he was bisexual. Similarly, Doe testified that he did not understand what Dolinger meant by the term \"poke,\" and had not understood it until Dolinger defined it for him. <i>See supra</i> at p. 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the Appeals Court reasonably discounted the relevance of the proffer relating to the \"revenge\" theory as propounded by Dolinger. First, although the defense maintained that Dolinger had confronted Doe in early 1994 about the \"kissing incident,\" Doe testified that he could not remember the reason for the confrontation. More importantly, Doe's prior homosexual relationship with a younger boy at most would tend to show Doe's precocious understanding regarding sexual mechanics, rather than demonstrate his awareness that an allegation that an adult had raped a child could be used as a weapon of revenge. <i>Dolinger,</i> No. 97-P-558, at 5 (Mass.App.Ct. Mar.6, 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Commonwealth courts appropriately evaluated the materiality and relevance of the Dolinger proffer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Prejudice</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Dolinger contends that (i) the Massachusetts rape-shield statute precludes evidence of a victim's predisposition to sexual promiscuity, <i>unless independently relevant to the victim's biases, see Commonwealth v. O.C Houston,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></span>, 945 (Mass.2000); and (ii) in all events the protections afforded under the rape-shield statute cannot trump the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Appeals Court recognized that the analyses required under <i>Olden</i> and the Massachusetts rape-shield statute are not incompatible, but rather that each requires a similar balancing of competing factors. The rape-shield statute establishes a rebuttable presumption that evidence of a victim's alleged sexual promiscuity would be prejudicial to the rape victim, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 233, &#167; 21B (\"Evidence of the reputation of a victim's sexual conduct shall not be admissible ... provided, however, that such evidence shall be admissible only after an in camera hearing [at which] ... the court finds that the weight and relevancy of said evidence is sufficient to outweigh its prejudicial effect to the victim.\"), since it seriously intrudes upon his privacy and threatens to permit the jury unfairly to extrapolate, from the victim's prior consensual sexual acts, his consensual participation in the crime charged. <i>See Houston,</i> 722 N.E.2d at 945; <i>see also Michigan v. Lucas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>, 149, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>. Thus, it is hardly an unreasonable application of <i>Olden</i> to conclude, in light of the potential for substantial jury confusion, that trial courts should first find compelling reasons before setting aside the presumption of nonadmissibility, particularly where, as here, the prejudice and harassing cross-examination proffered is to be inflicted upon a victim who is a minor. <i>Accord, e.g., Quinn v. Haynes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771397\"><a href=\"/opinion/771397/james-quinn-v-william-s-haynes-warden-huttonsville-correctional-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 850 (4th Cir.2000) (observing that state court appropriately considered minor victim's age and emotional susceptibility in determining whether to admit evidence of prior sexual conduct).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Redundancy</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dolinger maintains that no redundancy would have resulted had the trial court admitted his excluded proffer <i>along with</i> the other impeachment evidence. He contends that (i) Doe's motive to frame him, by way of revenge, was not strongly established by the other evidence admitted in the trial court &#8212; i.e., that Dolinger had confronted Doe in early 1994 regarding the \"kissing incident\" &#8212; since Doe testified that he could not remember what Dolinger had said to him during that confrontation, and the jury therefore could infer no concrete motive for Doe's revenge; and (ii) evidence that Doe previously had told his counselor that Dolinger raped him every day, instead of on the eleven occasions charged in the indictment, merely demonstrated Doe's predisposition to exaggerate facts, rather than a predisposition to fabricate events (i.e., the rapes) out of whole cloth. On the other hand, however, given the level of prejudice threatened by the Dolinger proffer, it was not unreasonable for the state courts to determine that Dolinger had been accorded an <i>adequate opportunity</i> to challenge Doe's bias and truthfulness <i>in other meaningful ways.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, whether or not the \"kissing incident\" constituted the motive for Doe's alleged revenge is largely immaterial. The jury was presented with evidence that Dolinger had confronted Doe angrily a few days before Doe made the rape accusations, and in fact had made Doe cry. We think that this evidence, if accepted by the jury, was itself sufficient to support the defense theory that Doe had framed Dolinger out of revenge. <i>See, e.g., Stephens,</i> 13 F.3d at 1002 (noting that the defendant adduced evidence that \"he said something to [his victim] that angered her and caused her to fabricate the attempted rape charge,\" but trial court properly excluded further lurid details of the victim's past sexual conduct \"to avoid embarrassing her and subjecting her to possible public denigration\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as concerns the prior inconsistent statement by Doe, in the present context we perceive no significant distinction between Doe's predispositions to exaggerate and to lie, since each strongly suggests his tendency to speak untruthfully: whether regarding the occurrence of the rapes or their frequency. Thus, we conclude that it was not beyond the realm of reason for the Commonwealth courts to determine that the `Dolinger proffer was largely cumulative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under section 2254(d)(1), it is immaterial whether we would assess the <i>Olden</i> factors as the Commonwealth courts have done in the instant case had we been directly presented with these issues in a non-habeas context. Of necessity, a balancing test normally occasions an exercise of the trial court's informed discretion. <i>See Domaingue v. MacDonald,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2135820\"><a href=\"/opinion/2135820/domaingue-v-macdonald/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 58 (D.Mass.1997) (upholding discretionary exclusion of evidence of incest victim's alleged prior sexual promiscuity, given that trial court otherwise afforded defendant \"a reasonable opportunity to question the witness' veracity and motivation,\" and to present \"a reasonably complete picture of the witness's bias\") (citing <i>United States v. Laboy-Delgado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196771\"><a href=\"/opinion/196771/united-states-v-laboy-delgado/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.1996)). Thus, it is sufficient that we are able to conclude that the Commonwealth courts \"identifie[d] the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme] Court's decisions [<i>viz.,</i> the <i>Olden</i> factors],\" \"appl[ied] that principle to the facts of the ... case,\" and reasonably balanced the competing factors. <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 412-13, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
