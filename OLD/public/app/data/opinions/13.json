Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge, and\n                 Gajarsa* and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n       Victor P. Miranda-Corrada for appellant.\n       María Teresa Juan Urrutia for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          February 23, 2010\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.          In this workplace discrimination\n\nand retaliation suit, the district court ruled that plaintiff,\n\nErick Carreras, failed to comply with Puerto Rico's anti-ferret\n\nrule, D.P.R.R. 56(c).          On this basis, it deemed as admitted\n\nportions of defendant Sajo, García & Partners' (\"SGP\") statement of\n\nuncontested   facts     and   granted      summary   judgment     to   defendant.\n\nCarreras argues on appeal that the district court improperly\n\ninvoked Local Rule 56 and erred in rejecting his claims under the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213\n\n(\"ADA\"), and various Puerto Rico anti-discrimination laws.                       We\n\ndisagree and affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n            We begin with a recitation of the basic facts underlying\n\nthe   dispute,     derived    from   the     facts   explicitly    admitted       by\n\nCarreras.   SGP,    a   marketing    agency,    hired   Carreras       as   an   Art\n\nDirector in December 2003.           Carreras' responsibilities included\n\npreparing the creative art for products being marketed by SGP.                    In\n\nAugust 2004, Carreras and Sajo Ruíz, an SGP partner, exchanged\n\nheated emails about Carreras' alleged failure to complete work on\n\ntime.1   Carreras has type II diabetes, which he controls by taking\n\ninsulin every morning and evening.              At the commencement of his\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Although Carreras characterizes Ruíz's email as a tantrum, he\ndoes not deny that it was sent and that he replied.\n\n                                      -2-\n\femployment with SGP, Carreras filled out a form on which he\n\nindicated that he had diabetes and was dependent on insulin.\n\n           On October 21, 2004, Carreras emailed Ruíz informing him\n\nthat he had worked late that evening and had been prevented from\n\ntaking his insulin shot.      Ruíz replied the next morning asking\n\nCarreras to clarify what had prevented him from taking his medicine\n\nand stating that there should be no obstacle to Carreras taking his\n\ntreatment. In response, Carreras stated that he was prevented from\n\nadministering his medicine because he had to stay late at the\n\noffice.2   SGP terminated Carreras' employment on October 25, 2004.\n\n           Carreras filed suit against SGP alleging that he had\n\nexperienced discrimination based on his disability and retaliation\n\nfor requesting a reasonable accommodation in violation of the ADA.\n\n42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213.    After discovery was complete, SGP moved\n\nfor summary judgment and filed a separate Statement of Uncontested\n\nFacts in support of its motion.    In response, Carreras submitted a\n\ndocument   styled   as   \"Plaintiff's   Response   and   Objections   to\n\nDefendant's Proposed Statement of Uncontested Facts.\" The district\n\ncourt found that statement to be defective under Puerto Rico Local\n\nRule 56 because it failed to admit, qualify or deny certain facts\n\n\n\n2\n  SGP's personnel manual listed working hours as 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.,\nbut expressly stated that working hours are irregular in the\nadvertising industry and that all employees must be available when\nnecessary during and/or after normal hours.      The only storage\nrequirement for Carreras' insulin was refrigeration. SGP had a\nrefrigerator available to employees at its offices.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fproposed by SGP, it did not contain a separate section for the new\n\nfacts it sought to introduce, and it did not contain appropriate\n\ncitation to the record to support denied facts.\n\n           In accordance with the anti-ferret rule, the district\n\ncourt disregarded those portions of Carreras' opposition it found\n\ndefective and deemed as admitted many of SGP's properly supported\n\nfacts.   See D.P.R.R. 56(e).      With its recitation of the facts in\n\nits written opinion, the district court made clear the facts it\n\ndeemed admitted.      The court focused primarily on those facts\n\npertaining to the effect, or lack thereof, of Carreras' diabetes on\n\nhis work and daily life.     In a footnote, the court explained that\n\n\"the reason for [Carreras'] dismissal is in dispute.              However,\n\nbecause it is immaterial for the resolution of this case, we will\n\neschew   any   discussion   in   this   regard.\"   Hence,   the   court's\n\nrecitation of \"Uncontested Facts\" in its opinion, where it sets\n\nforth the effect of its deeming analysis on the summary judgment\n\nrecord, does not focus on the retaliation claim.\n\n           After making its deeming determination, the district\n\ncourt granted summary judgment to SGP based on Carreras' failure to\n\ncreate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he is\n\ndisabled within the meaning of the ADA.       The court noted, however,\n\nthat even if Carreras qualified as disabled, his arguments that SGP\n\nfailed to accommodate his disability must fail because Carreras had\n\nneither requested nor been denied accommodation.            For the same\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\freason, the district court rejected Carreras' claim that he was\n\nretaliated    against     for    making   a     request    for    reasonable\n\naccommodation.\n\n            Carreras appeals, contending that his statement complied\n\nwith the local rule and that the district court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment based on its deeming order.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            Carreras    argues   that   the   district    court   improperly\n\napplied Local Rule 56(c), the District of Puerto Rico's anti-ferret\n\nrule.    The rule states, in relevant part:\n\n            A party opposing a motion for summary judgment\n            shall submit with its opposition a separate,\n            short, and concise statement of material\n            facts.   The opposing statement shall admit,\n            deny or qualify the facts by reference to each\n            numbered paragraph of the moving party's\n            statement of material facts and unless a fact\n            is admitted, shall support each denial or\n            qualification by a record citation as required\n            by this rule. The opposing statement may\n            contain in a separate section additional\n            facts,   set  forth   in   separate   numbered\n            paragraphs and supported by a record citation\n            as required by subsection (e) of this rule.\n\nD.P.R.R. 56(c).    Subsection (e) of the rule states that citations\n\nmust be \"to the specific page or paragraph of identified record\n\nmaterial supporting the assertion.\"           D.P.R.R. 56(e).     Failure to\n\ncomply with the anti-ferret rule permits the court to \"disregard\n\nany statement of fact not supported by a specific citation to\n\nrecord material properly considered on summary judgment.\" D.P.R.R.\n\n56(e).       We review the district court's application of a local\n\n                                    -5-\n\frule for abuse of discretion.          See Sánchez-Figueroa v. Banco\n\nPopular de Puerto Rico, 527 F.3d 209, 213 (1st Cir. 2008).           While\n\na district court may choose not to invoke the rule in response to\n\nevery violation, we have consistently upheld the enforcement of the\n\nrule, and we treat the district court's decision to apply it with\n\ndeference.    See CMI Capital Market Inv. v. González-Toro, 520 F.3d\n\n58, 62-63 (1st Cir. 2008); Mariani-Colón v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,\n\n511 F.3d 216, 219 (1st Cir. 2007); Cabán Hernández v. Philip Morris\n\nUSA, Inc., 486 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2007).     The rule is intended \"to\n\nrelieve the district court of any responsibility to ferret through\n\nthe record to discern whether any material fact is genuinely in\n\ndispute.\"    CMI Capital Market, 520 F.3d at 62.     It prevents parties\n\nfrom \"improperly shift[ing] the burden of organizing the evidence\n\npresented in a given case to the district court.\"           Mariani-Colón,\n\n511 F.3d at 219.   As such, the rule is important to the functioning\n\nof the district court.\n\n            Here, Carreras did submit a response to SGP's Statement\n\nof   Uncontested   Facts.   Although   he   argues   that    his   response\n\nproperly accepted or denied every fact with appropriate citation,\n\nCarreras properly denied only certain of SGP's facts. Accordingly,\n\nthe district court stated that it would \"partially disregard\"\n\nCarreras' opposing statement of unconstested facts.3           The record\n\n\n3\n  Carreras argues that, despite its assertion to the contrary, the\ndistrict court rejected his entire response to SGP's Statement of\nUncontested Facts. We disagree. In its recitation of the facts,\n\n                                 -6-\n\fshows that in many instances Carreras' response manifestly ignores\n\nthe express requirements of the anti-ferret rule.           Most blatantly,\n\nin at least two instances, Carreras' opposition fails to \"accept,\n\nqualify or deny\" the fact listed by his opponent.                 Instead, it\n\nexplains    discursively   why   Carreras     believes    the    fact    to   be\n\nirrelevant.   Furthermore, Carreras' opposition frequently fails to\n\nsupport denied facts with appropriate citation to the record.\n\n            Finally,   Carreras'    response     includes       argumentation\n\nasserting   numerous   additional    facts.      Those    facts    are   often\n\nunsupported by record citations, they are not numbered, and they\n\nare not \"contain[ed] in a separate section.\"             Carreras' argument\n\nthat the rule does not require additional facts to be adduced in a\n\nseparate section is unavailing.       The plain language of the rule\n\nspecifically requires that additional facts be put forward in a\n\n\"separate section.\" D.P.R.R. 56(c). In light of these substantial\n\nfailings, the district court acted well within its discretion when\n\nit deemed as admitted a portion of SGP's properly supported facts.\n\n\n\n\nset forth in a portion of the opinion entitled \"Uncontested Facts,\"\nthe district court made clear which facts it considered to be\nuncontested with citations to the record signifying that certain of\nthose facts were derived from SGP's Statement of Uncontested Facts.\nAs noted, the court's focus in this recitation was on Carreras'\nworkplace discrimination claim, not his retaliation claim.      The\ndistrict court was under no obligation to go beyond the relevant\nfacts, as it saw them, in order to catalogue the sufficiency of\nCarreras' opposition to every one of SGP's proposed facts.\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f                                          III.\n\n           To survive summary judgment on his discrimination and\n\nretaliation claims, Carreras must establish a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial   fact      as     to        whether     he     experienced        disability\n\ndiscrimination or was retaliated-against within the meaning of the\n\nADA.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).4            Our review of the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment is de novo. Cabán-Hernández, 486 F.3d at\n\n8.   We \"draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable\n\nto the nonmovant.\"        Id.    We will not, however, \"draw unreasonable\n\ninferences or credit bald assertions, empty conclusions, [or] rank\n\nconjecture.\" Id. (emphasis in original).\n\nA. Disability Discrimination under the ADA\n\n           The    district        court    found       that   Carreras   failed     to\n\nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA\n\nbecause he could not establish that he is disabled within the\n\nmeaning of the statute.          Under the ADA, a disability is defined as:\n\n(a) a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one\n\nor more of an individual's major life activities; (b) a record of\n\nsuch   impairment;    or        (c)    being     regarded     as   having    such   an\n\nimpairment.   42 U.S.C. § 12102(1).5              We have employed a three-part\n\n\n4\n  \"A 'genuine' issue is one that could be resolved in favor of\neither party, and a 'material fact' is one that has the potential\nof affecting the outcome of the case.\" Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't\nof Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19 (1st Cir. 2004).\n5\n Although Carreras states on appeal that he was regarded as having\nan impairment, he did not assert this argument below and we deem it\n\n                                          -8-\n\ftest to determine whether an individual qualifies as disabled under\n\nthe first definition, which is at issue here.               First, does the\n\nplaintiff suffer a mental or physical impairment? Second, does the\n\nlife activity limited by the impairment qualify as \"major\"?                And\n\nfinally, does the impairment, in fact, substantially limit that\n\nmajor life activity?         See Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 20.            The\n\nburden is on the plaintiff to establish these three elements.              Id.\n\nCarreras contends that he is disabled because his diabetes is a\n\nphysical impairment that substantially limits his ability to eat\n\nand see, two major life activities.\n\n           We must determine the existence of a disability \"on a\n\ncase-by-case basis.\"     Albertson's, Inc., v. Kirkingburg, 527 U.S.\n\n555, 566 (1999).       Thus, we must assess the effect of Carreras'\n\nalleged   impairment    on   his   life,    rather   than   relying   on   his\n\ndiagnoses alone, in order to determine whether he is disabled\n\nwithin the meaning of the ADA.        Id.    We agree with Carreras that\n\ninsulin-dependant diabetes is a physical impairment.             See, e.g.,\n\nRohr v. Salt River Project Agric. Improvements and Power Dist., 555\n\nF.3d 850, 858 (9th Cir. 2009) (\"Diabetes is a 'physical impairment'\n\nbecause it affects the digestive, hemic and endocrine systems. . .\n\n\nto be waived. Even if Carreras had not waived this argument below,\nit would fail here because his brief contains no support for the\nclaim. As we have explained on many occasions, \"'[i]ssues adverted\nto in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at\ndeveloped argumentation, are deemed waived.'\"    United States v.\nRivera Calderon, 578 F.3d 78, 94 n.4 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n                                    -9-\n\f.\"). It is similarly beyond dispute that eating and seeing qualify\n\nas \"major life activities.\"          See, e.g., Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance\n\nServ., Inc., 283 F.3d 11, 21 (1st Cir. 2002) (major life activities\n\ninclude \"functions such as caring for oneself, . . . seeing\");\n\nCalero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 21 (recognizing eating as a major life\n\nactivity for purposes of the ADA).\n\n               We cannot agree, however, that on the record before us\n\nthere is any genuine issue of material fact as to whether Carreras'\n\ndiabetes \"substantially limited\" his ability to eat or to see.\n\n\"The     ADA     does   not    define     'substantially         limits,'     but\n\n'substantially' suggests 'considerable' or 'specified to a large\n\ndegree.'\"       Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 491\n\n(1999), superseded by statute on other grounds, ADA Amendments Act\n\nof 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, 172 Stat. 3553 (2008).                        To be\n\nsubstantially limiting, an impairment must cause a person to be\n\n\"unable to perform a major life activity that an average person in\n\nthe    general    population   can    perform,\"   or   to   be   significantly\n\nrestricted in the performance of a particular major life activity\n\nas compared to an average person in the general population.                    29\n\nC.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1); see also Carroll v. Xerox Corp., 294 F.3d\n\n231, 239 (1st Cir. 2002).6      In assessing in this case the degree of\n\n\n6\n  In considering whether a litigant's physical impairment is\nsubstantially limiting for purposes of the ADA, the inquiry is not\nconfined to limitations that might occur in the workplace.

Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 200-01\n(2002), superseded by statute on other grounds, ADA Amendments Act\n\n                                       -10-\n\flimitation occasioned by a physical impairment, we also take into\n\nconsideration \"the effectiveness, side effects and burdens of a\n\nplaintiff's mitigating measures,\" in this case Carreras' twice-\n\ndaily insulin shots.        Rohr, 555 F.3d at 859 (citing Sutton, 482\n\nU.S.     at    482-84).7      Our      inquiry     is   \"fact-intensive    and\n\nindividualized.\"        Sepulveda v. Glickman, 167 F. Supp. 2d 186, 191\n\n(D.P.R. 2001); Sutton, 527 U.S. at 483.\n\n              1. Carreras' claim that his diabetes substantially limits\nhis vision\n\n              The facts of record fail to create a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to whether Carreras' vision is substantially\n\nlimited by his diabetes.          Carreras asserts that high blood sugar\n\nlevels    cause   his    vision   to   blur,     constituting   a   substantial\n\nlimitation under the ADA.         He does not contest, however, that his\n\n\n\nof 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, 172 Stat. 3553 (2008).        Rather,\ncourts must focus on whether a major life activity is substantially\nimpaired in the course of a litigant's daily life. Id. at 200-02.\n7\n  Carreras has made no argument about the effect of the ADA\nAmendments Act of 2008 on his claim. See Pub. L. No. 110-325, §\n2(a)(4)-(6), 122 Stat. 3553 (2008). Regardless, that law is not\nretroactive where, as here, the disputed activity occurred before\nits passage and Congress expressed no clear intent to make the\nstatute retroactive.    We have recently suggested as much, see\nThornton v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 587 F.3d 27, 34 n.3 (1st\nCir. 2009), and all circuits to consider the issue to date have so\nheld.   See Becerril v. Pima County Assessor's Office, 587 F.3d\n1162, 1164 (9th Cir. 2009) (per curiam); Fredericksen v. United\nParcel Serv., 581 F.3d 516, 521 n.1 (7th Cir. 2009); Lytes v. DC\nWater & Sewer Auth., 572 F.3d 936, 940 (D.C. Cir. 2009);\nMilholland v. Summer County Bd. of Educ., 569 F.3d 562 (6th Cir.\n2009); E.E.O.C. v. Agro Distribution, LLC, 555 F.3d 462, 469 n.8\n(5th Cir. 2009).\n\n                                       -11-\n\flatest blurred vision episode occurred a year before he was deposed\n\nin this case.        Nor does he set forth facts that would explain how\n\nsuch   infrequent      episodes    of    blurred    vision    cause     him   to    be\n\nsignificantly restricted in his ability to see.                    \"To qualify as\n\ndisabling, a limitation . . . must be permanent or long term, and\n\nconsiderable compared to the [seeing] most people do in their daily\n\nlives.\" Fredricksen v. United Parcel Serv., Co., 581 F.3d 516, 522\n\n(7th Cir. 2009) (citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n              The facts show that Carreras' ability to see does not\n\ndiffer in a significant way from the ability to see of the general\n\npopulation.     Cf. Albertson's, Inc., v. Kirkingburg, 527 U.S. 555,\n\n565-67 (1999) (finding that monocular individuals must \"prove a\n\ndisability by offering evidence that the extent of the limitation\n\nin terms of their own experience, as in loss of depth perception\n\nand visual field, is substantial\"); Kelly v. Drexel Univ., 94 F.3d\n\n102,   106,    108    (3d   Cir.   1996)      (finding    plaintiff's    limp      and\n\ninability to walk more than a mile or jog did not \"substantially\n\nlimit him in the relevant major life activity, walking\").                     It is\n\nundisputed that Carreras drives his son to school and himself to\n\nwork every morning, drives home again in the evening, reads as part\n\nof   his   current     employment,      and    performs    other   routine    daily\n\nactivities that presumably would not be possible if his vision were\n\nsubstantially impaired.        See Scheerer v. Potter, 443 F.3d 916, 920\n\n(7th Cir. 2006) (finding diabetic with \"intermittent episodes of\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fsignificant neuropathy\" not substantially limited in his ability to\n\nwalk because \"he nonetheless was generally able to walk and stand\n\nduring the pertinent time period\").               As described in the record,\n\nCarreras' diabetes does not limit his sight to a degree that would\n\ndifferentiate him from the rest of the population.\n\n              2. Carreras' claim that his diabetes substantially limits\nhis eating\n\n              Carreras has also failed to raise a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to whether his diabetes substantially limits his\n\nlife activity of eating.          It is undisputed that Carreras' diabetes\n\nrequires certain adjustments to his diet.                     He avoids refined\n\nflours, drinks juice that is not artificially sweetened, and eats\n\nsix   meals    a    day.    Proof      that   a   medical   condition   \"requires\n\nmedication, a fixed meal schedule, [and] timely snack breaks,\"\n\nwithout more, does not amount to a \"substantial limitation\" under\n\nthe ADA.       Sepulveda, 167 F. Supp. 2d at 191 (quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n              The analysis of when and under what conditions diabetes\n\nis considered a disability for ADA purposes \"is a matter of\n\ndegree.\"      Id. at 190.    We recognize that living with diabetes may\n\nresult in a complex calculus balancing food intake, activity level,\n\nand the amount of insulin administered.              An individual living with\n\ndiabetes may or may not experience a substantial limitation in his\n\nor    her   ability    to   eat   as    contrasted     with   the   rest   of   the\n\npopulation.        See, e.g., Lawson v. CSX Transp., Inc., 245 F.3d 916,\n\n                                         -13-\n\f924 (7th Cir. 2001) (describing substantial limitation on eating\n\nentailed   by   \"perpetual,   multi-faceted   and   demanding    treatment\n\nregime\" for plaintiff's diabetes (quotation marks omitted)); Rohr,\n\n555 F.3d at 859 (finding genuine issue of material fact as to\n\nwhether plaintiff had a substantial impairment in eating where he\n\ndescribed controlling his disease through a combination of diet and\n\ninsulin as \"being on a chemical rollercoaster\" (quotation marks\n\nomitted)).      Many diabetics follow a \"severely restrictive, and\n\nhighly demanding\" regimen to control their disease from which any\n\ndeviation could result in a trip to the emergency room.         See Fraser\n\nv. Goodale, 342 F.3d 1032, 1041 (9th Cir. 2003).\n\n           The record indicates, however, that Carreras is at the\n\nfar end of the spectrum from those plaintiffs who \"cannot put a\n\nmorsel of food\" into their mouths \"without carefully assessing\n\nwhether it will tip [their] blood sugar[]\" levels.        Id.8    He does\n\nnot dispute that his twice daily insulin shots successfully control\n\nhis diabetes.     Cf. Lawson, 245 F.3d at 924 (finding jury question\n\nas to whether diabetic could meet the substantial limitation\n\nthreshold because \"even when taking insulin, [plaintiff's] 'ability\n\nto regulate his blood sugar and metabolize food is difficult,\n\nerratic, and substantially limited'\"). Indeed, the facts are that,\n\nby taking two insulin shots each day and eating fairly often,\n\n\n8\n  Carreras' complaint states that failure to take his insulin\ncauses headaches and an undefined \"loss of control of his\ncondition.\"\n\n                                  -14-\n\fCarreras succeeds in preventing his diabetes from substantially\n\nlimiting any of his major life activities.             Compare Sutton, 527\n\nU.S. at 488-89 (the wearing of corrective lenses to neutralize the\n\neffects of myopia negated substantial impairment of vision caused\n\nby plaintiff's disability) with Lawson, 245 F.3d at 925-26 (the\n\nneed to coordinate \"multifaceted factors\" and to maintain \"constant\n\nvigilance\" over plaintiff's insulin regimen, coupled with the grave\n\neffects    of    noncompliance,   distinguished   plaintiff's     case   from\n\nSutton).\n\n            3. Summary\n\n            In    summary,   Carreras   adduces   no   evidence   that    his\n\ndiabetes causes more than minor limitations on his eating and\n\nseeing.    See Rohr, 555 F.3d at 860 (\"If daily insulin injections\n\nalone more or less stabilized [plaintiff's] blood sugar levels,\n\nsuch that any limitation imposed on his diet would be minor, then\n\n[his] major life activity of eating might not be substantially\n\nlimited.\").       We therefore agree with the district court that\n\nCarreras has not raised a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\nwhether he is disabled under the ADA.\n\nB. Retaliation under the ADA9\n\n            The retaliation provision in the ADA states that \"[n]o\n\nperson shall discriminate against any individual because such\n\n\n9\n  We note that the district court did not circumscribe the summary\njudgment record with a deeming order that applies to the\nretaliation claim.\n\n                                    -15-\n\findividual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this\n\nchapter.\"    42 U.S.C. § 12203(a).         In order to establish a claim of\n\nretaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show (1) that he\n\nengaged in protected conduct, (2) that he suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action, and (3) that there was a causal connection\n\nbetween the protected conduct and the adverse employment action.\n\nSoileau v. Guilford of Maine, Inc., 105 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).10   It is well established that \"requesting an accommodation,\n\nwithout filing a formal charge or engaging in other specific\n\nbehaviors listed in § 12203(a), is nonetheless behavior protected\n\nfrom an employer's retaliation.\" Wright v. CompUSA, Inc., 352 F.3d\n\n472,   477-78    (1st   Cir.   2003).      Even       if   he     fails   to   bring   a\n\nsuccessful      disability     claim    under    the       ADA,    a   plaintiff      may\n\nnonetheless assert a claim for retaliation.                  Soileau, 105 F.3d at\n\n16.\n\n            Once   a    plaintiff      makes    out    a    prima      facie   case    of\n\nretaliation, \"the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a\n\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision.\"\n\nWright, 352 F.3d at 478 (citation and quotation marks omitted); see\n\nalso McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-804 (1973)\n\n(establishing burden-shifting framework for Title VII cases).                         The\n\n10\n In Soileau, we explained that because of the relatedness of the\ntwo statutes, “guidance on the proper analysis of [an] ADA\nretaliation claim is found in Title VII cases.” 105 F.3d at 16.\nWe therefore refer to cases interpreting Title VII’s retaliation\nprovision as well as those specifically addressing the ADA in\nconducting our analysis of Carreras’ retaliation claim.\n\n                                        -16-\n\femployer's burden is \"one of production, not persuasion.\"    Reeves\n\nv. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 142 (2000).    If\n\nthe employer produces a legitimate reason for its decision, \"the\n\nburden under McDonnell Douglas shifts back to the plaintiff to show\n\nthat the motive was discriminatory [or retaliatory].\"    Sabinson v.\n\nTrs. of Dartmouth Coll., 542 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing\n\nReeves, 530 U.S. at 142-43); see also Kersey v. Wash. Metro. Area\n\nTransit Auth., 586 F.3d 13, 17 (D.C. Cir. 2009).          Thus, the\n\nplaintiff bears the ultimate burden to create a plausible inference\n\nthat the employer had a retaliatory motive.    Benoit v. Technical\n\nMfg. Corp., 331 F.3d 166, 174 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          Carreras argues that his email to Ruíz and three other\n\nSGP supervisors sent on October 21, 2004, in which he informed them\n\nthat he had to work late and had been prevented from taking his\n\ninsulin shot, constituted a request for a reasonable accommodation\n\nunder the ADA.11   He contends that his firing on October 25, 2004\n\nwas a direct result of that request for accommodation.   He asserts\n\nthat he is entitled to an inference of causal connection between\n\nthe two events because his termination occurred in such close\n\ntemporal proximity to his engaging in protected conduct.\n\n\n\n11\n  Carreras attempts to argue, in the alternative, that his email\nsomehow constituted opposition to his employer's \"interfer[ence]\nwith the treatment for his diabetes,\" and that such opposition is\nprotected conduct under the ADA. This claim is undeveloped and\ntherefore waived.    Even if it were not, our analysis of the\nretaliation claim would be the same.\n\n                               -17-\n\f           The district court found that Carreras had not requested\n\nan accommodation within the meaning of the ADA and granted summary\n\njudgment for SGP on the claim of retaliation.               We affirm that\n\njudgment, albeit on different grounds.             See Estades-Negroni v.\n\nAssocs. Corp. of North Am., 377 F.3d 58, 62 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"We\n\nmay affirm . . . on any grounds supported by the record.\").\n\n           For     convenience   we    assume,    without   deciding,      that\n\nCarreras has made his prima facie case.          As noted, once an employee\n\nhas made a prima facie showing of retaliation, the burden shifts to\n\nthe employer to produce evidence that there was a legitimate, non-\n\nretaliatory motive for the adverse employment action.             Wright, 352\n\nF.3d at 478.     SGP has met its burden.         SGP claims that Carreras'\n\ndeficient performance and insubordination prompted the SGP partners\n\nto   terminate   his   employment.      In   support   of   its   claim,    SGP\n\nintroduced the email from Ruíz to Carreras. That email, written in\n\nall capital letters and dated August 25, 2004, reads, in relevant\n\npart:\n\n           IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING TO NOT BE ABLE TO COUNT\n           ON YOUR PRESENCE WHEN I MOST NEED YOU.       I\n           CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE UNEXPECTED, BUT IT\n           ALWAYS HAPPENS THAT WHEN I HAVE A MEETING WITH\n           A CLIENT, I AM MISSING THE UNFINISHED\n           MATERIAL; AND THE RESPONSIBLE PERSON HAS A\n           PERSONAL ISSUE TO SOLVE.12\n\n           . . .\n\n12\n   From Carreras' response to this email, which is also in the\nrecord, we deduce that the \"personal issue\" to which Ruíz refers\nwas Carreras' failure to come to work on time because he did not\nhave his glasses.\n\n                                      -18-\n\f             IN THE FUTURE, CALL ME DIRECTLY AT THE CELL\n             PHONE OR AT MY HOME, AND I'LL COME AND FINISH\n             THE ART EVEN IF I HAVE TO WORK ALL NIGHT.\n\nThis    documentary     evidence    showing      Ruíz's   dissatisfaction        with\n\nCarreras meets SGP's burden of producing evidence that demonstrates\n\nits legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for firing Carreras.\n\n             In the face of such evidence, Carreras bears the ultimate\n\nburden of establishing that SGP's stated reason for his dismissal\n\nis a pretext for retaliation.             Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R.\n\nWireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46, 54 (1st Cir. 2000). Carreras attempts\n\nto meet this burden by pointing to what he characterizes as\n\ninconsistencies in statements given by SGP managers about the\n\nreason he was fired, when the decision to fire him was made, and\n\nwhy there was a delay between the making of that decision and the\n\nfiring.     Specifically, Carreras cites deposition testimony showing\n\nthat two of three members of SGP's management recalled that the\n\ndecision to terminate Carreras was made in early-to-mid October,\n\nwhile    another    thought   it    was   made     at   the    end   of   September.\n\nFurther, Carreras cites deposition testimony showing that one of\n\nthose managers thought there was some delay between the decision\n\nand Carreras' firing because Carreras might improve his performance\n\nin   that   time,   a   second     thought    it    was   in    order     to   hire   a\n\nreplacement, and a third thought the delay involved the need to\n\ncomplete legal paperwork. Finally, in its Joint Initial Scheduling\n\nConference Memorandum, SGP said the reason for Carreras' firing was\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fthat his \"output was not timely and up to the quality standards\n\nthat defendant requested for him.\"           By contrast, Carreras argues,\n\nRuíz stated in his deposition that Carreras did good work, but that\n\nhe was fired because of \"coworker complaints and because he was not\n\ngetting his job done in time.\"13\n\n              An employee can establish pretext \"by showing weaknesses,\n\nimplausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions\n\nin   the   employer's    proffered    legitimate     reasons     such   that   a\n\nfactfinder could infer that the employer did not act for the\n\nasserted non-discriminatory reasons.\"          Id. at 56 (quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted) (emphasis added).           The minor inconsistencies\n\ncited by Carreras, however, do not undermine SGP's contention that\n\nhis work performance was unsatisfactory. The slight differences in\n\nSGP's accounts of the timing of the decision or the reason for the\n\nshort delay before its implementation do not permit a reasonable\n\nfactfinder to infer that SGP did not fire Carreras because of his\n\npoor   work    performance.     The    evidence    was    consistent    on   the\n\nessential     point,   i.e.,   that   Carreras'    work    was   untimely    and\n\ntherefore unsatisfactory.       Our laws are designed to ensure against\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation, not \"inaccuracy by an employer.\"\n\nRivas Rosado v. Radio Shack, Inc., 312 F.3d 532, 535 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).     Moreover, the dissatisfaction with Carreras was expressed\n\n13\n   Carreras also cites the lack of \"written evidence\" of any\ndeficiencies in his performance during the months preceding his\nfiring. In making this argument, Carreras overlooks the August\n2004 email from Ruíz.\n\n                                      -20-\n\fin writing two months before he complained about having to work\n\nlate and was fired.          This is not a case in which the employer's\n\n\"nondiscriminatory      reasons     were   after-the-fact    justifications,\n\nprovided subsequent to the beginning of legal action.\"             Santiago-\n\nRamos, 217 F.3d at 56.\n\n            In the final analysis, the only evidence in the summary\n\njudgment record supporting Carreras' retaliation claim is the\n\ntemporal proximity between his October 21, 2004 email to Ruíz and\n\nhis firing on October 25, 2004.                Such temporal proximity may\n\nsuffice for a prima facie case of retaliation.          It does not satisfy\n\nCarreras' ultimate burden to establish that the true explanation\n\nfor his firing was retaliation for engaging in protected conduct\n\nrather than poor performance.          See Holloway, 275 F. App'x at 27\n\n(suspicions raised by temporal proximity \"can be authoritatively\n\ndispelled   .   .   .   by   an   employer's    convincing   account   of   the\n\nlegitimate reasons for the firing\"); see also Soileau, 105 F.3d at\n\n16-17 (rejecting claim of retaliation based solely on temporal\n\nproximity).     We affirm the entry of summary judgment for SGP on\n\nCarreras' retaliation claim under the ADA.14\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n14\n  We also affirm the district court's dismissal without prejudice\nof Carreras' claims arising under Puerto Rico law. See Penobscot\nIndian Nation v. Key Bank of Maine, 112 F.3d 538, 564 (1st Cir.\n1997) (\"[T]he decision to retain or disclaim jurisdiction over the\nremaining state law claims at issue in this case lies in the broad\ndiscretion of the district court.\")\n\n                                      -21-\n\f",

Miranda-Corrada for appellant.</p>\n<p>María Teresa Juan Urrutia for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, and GAJARSA<sup>[*]</sup> and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>In this workplace discrimination and retaliation suit, the district court ruled that plaintiff, Erick Carreras, failed to comply with Puerto Rico's anti-ferret rule, D.P.R.R. 56(c). On this basis, it deemed as admitted portions of defendant Sajo, García &amp; Partners' (\"SGP\") statement of uncontested facts and granted summary judgment to defendant. Carreras argues on appeal that the district court improperly invoked Local Rule 56 and erred in rejecting his claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213 (\"ADA\"), and various Puerto Rico anti-discrimination laws. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We begin with a recitation of the basic facts underlying the dispute, derived from the facts explicitly admitted by Carreras. SGP, a marketing agency, hired Carreras as an Art Director in December 2003. Carreras' responsibilities included preparing the creative art for products being marketed by SGP. In August 2004, Carreras <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> and Sajo Ruíz, an SGP partner, exchanged heated emails about Carreras' alleged failure to complete work on time.<sup>[1]</sup> Carreras has type II diabetes, which he controls by taking insulin every morning and evening. At the commencement of his employment with SGP, Carreras filled out a form on which he indicated that he had diabetes and was dependent on insulin.</p>\n<p>On October 21, 2004, Carreras emailed Ruíz informing him that he had worked late that evening and had been prevented from taking his insulin shot. Ruíz replied the next morning asking Carreras to clarify what had prevented him from taking his medicine and stating that there should be no obstacle to Carreras taking his treatment. In response, Carreras stated that he was prevented from administering his medicine because he had to stay late at the office.<sup>[2]</sup> SGP terminated Carreras' employment on October 25, 2004.</p>\n<p>Carreras filed suit against SGP alleging that he had experienced discrimination based on his disability and retaliation for requesting a reasonable accommodation in violation of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213. After discovery was complete, SGP moved for summary judgment and filed a separate Statement of Uncontested Facts in support of its motion. In response, Carreras submitted a document styled as \"Plaintiff's Response and Objections to Defendant's Proposed Statement of Uncontested Facts.\" The district court found that statement to be defective under Puerto Rico Local Rule 56 because it failed to admit, qualify or deny certain facts proposed by SGP, it did not contain a separate section for the new facts it sought to introduce, and it did not contain appropriate citation to the record to support denied facts.</p>\n<p>In accordance with the anti-ferret rule, the district court disregarded those portions of Carreras' opposition it found defective and deemed as admitted many of SGP's properly supported facts. <i>See</i> D.P.R.R. 56(e). With its recitation of the facts in its written opinion, the district court made clear the facts it deemed admitted. The court focused primarily on those facts pertaining to the effect, or lack thereof, of Carreras' diabetes on his work and daily life. In a footnote, the court explained that \"the reason for [Carreras'] dismissal is in dispute. However, because it is immaterial for the resolution of this case, we will eschew any discussion in this regard.\" Hence, the court's recitation of \"Uncontested Facts\" in its opinion, where it sets forth the effect of its deeming analysis on the summary judgment record, does not focus on the retaliation claim.</p>\n<p>After making its deeming determination, the district court granted summary judgment to SGP based on Carreras' failure to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA. The court noted, however, that even if Carreras qualified as disabled, his arguments that SGP failed to accommodate his disability must fail because Carreras had neither requested nor been denied accommodation. For the same reason, the district court rejected Carreras' claim that he was retaliated against for making a request for reasonable accommodation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> Carreras appeals, contending that his statement complied with the local rule and that the district court erred in granting summary judgment based on its deeming order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Carreras argues that the district court improperly applied Local Rule 56(c), the District of Puerto Rico's anti-ferret rule. The rule states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>A party opposing a motion for summary judgment shall submit with its opposition a separate, short, and concise statement of material facts. The opposing statement shall admit, deny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material facts and unless a fact is admitted, shall support each denial or qualification by a record citation as required by this rule. The opposing statement may contain in a separate section additional facts, set forth in separate numbered paragraphs and supported by a record citation as required by subsection (e) of this rule.</blockquote>\n<p>D.P.R.R. 56(c). Subsection (e) of the rule states that citations must be \"to the specific page or paragraph of identified record material supporting the assertion.\" D.P.R.R. 56(e). Failure to comply with the anti-ferret rule permits the court to \"disregard any statement of fact not supported by a specific citation to record material properly considered on summary judgment.\" D.P.R.R. 56(e). We review the district court's application of a local rule for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Sánchez-Figueroa v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico,</i> 527 F.3d 209, 213 (1st Cir.2008). While a district court may choose not to invoke the rule in response to every violation, we have consistently upheld the enforcement of the rule, and we treat the district court's decision to apply it with deference. <i>See </i><i>CMI Capital Market Inv. v. González-Toro,</i> 520 F.3d 58, 62-63 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Mariani-Colón v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</i> 511 F.3d 216, 219 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Cabán Hernández v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.,</i> 486 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2007). The rule is intended \"to relieve the district court of any responsibility to ferret through the record to discern whether any material fact is genuinely in dispute.\" <i>CMI Capital Market,</i> 520 F.3d at 62. It prevents parties from \"improperly shift[ing] the burden of organizing the evidence presented in a given case to the district court.\" <i>Mariani-Colón,</i> 511 F.3d at 219. As such, the rule is important to the functioning of the district court.</p>\n<p>Here, Carreras did submit a response to SGP's Statement of Uncontested Facts. Although he argues that his response properly accepted or denied every fact with appropriate citation, Carreras properly denied only certain of SGP's facts. Accordingly, the district court stated that it would \"<i>partially</i> disregard\" Carreras' opposing statement of uncontested facts.<sup>[3]</sup> The record shows that in many instances Carreras' response manifestly ignores the express requirements of the anti-ferret rule. Most blatantly, in at least two instances, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> Carreras' opposition fails to \"accept, qualify or deny\" the fact listed by his opponent. Instead, it explains discursively why Carreras believes the fact to be irrelevant. Furthermore, Carreras' opposition frequently fails to support denied facts with appropriate citation to the record.</p>\n<p>Finally, Carreras' response includes argumentation asserting numerous additional facts. Those facts are often unsupported by record citations, they are not numbered, and they are not \"contain[ed] in a separate section.\" Carreras' argument that the rule does not require additional facts to be adduced in a separate section is unavailing. The plain language of the rule specifically requires that additional facts be put forward in a \"separate section.\" D.P.R.R. 56(c). In light of these substantial failings, the district court acted well within its discretion when it deemed as admitted a portion of SGP's properly supported facts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>To survive summary judgment on his discrimination and retaliation claims, Carreras must establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he experienced disability discrimination or was retaliated-against within the meaning of the ADA. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).<sup>[4]</sup> Our review of the district court's grant of summary judgment is de novo. <i>Cabán-Hernández,</i> 486 F.3d at 8. We \"draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.\" <i>Id.</i> We will not, however, \"draw <i>unreasonable</i> inferences or credit bald assertions, empty conclusions, [or] rank conjecture.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Disability Discrimination under the ADA</h2>\n<p>The district court found that Carreras failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA because he could not establish that he is disabled within the meaning of the statute. Under the ADA, a disability is defined as: (a) a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of an individual's major life activities; (b) a record of such impairment; or (c) being regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1).<sup>[5]</sup> We have employed a three-part test to determine whether an individual qualifies as disabled under the first definition, which is at issue here. First, does the plaintiff suffer a mental or physical impairment? Second, does the life activity limited by the impairment qualify as \"major\"? And finally, does the impairment, in fact, substantially limit that major life activity? <i>See </i><i>Calero-Cerezo,</i> 355 F.3d at 20. The burden is on the plaintiff to establish these three elements. <i>Id.</i> Carreras contends that he is disabled because his diabetes is a physical impairment that substantially limits his ability to eat and see, two major life activities.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> We must determine the existence of a disability \"on a case-by-case basis.\" <i>Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg,</i> 527 U.S. 555, 566, 119 S.Ct. 2162, 144 L.Ed.2d 518 (1999). Thus, we must assess the effect of Carreras' alleged impairment on his life, rather than relying on his diagnoses alone, in order to determine whether he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA. <i>Id.</i> We agree with Carreras that insulin-dependent diabetes is a physical impairment. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rohr v. Salt River Project Agric. Improvements and Power Dist.,</i> 555 F.3d 850, 858 (9th Cir.2009) (\"Diabetes is a `physical impairment' because it affects the digestive, hemic and endocrine systems....\"). It is similarly beyond dispute that eating and seeing qualify as \"major life activities.\" <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., Inc.,</i> 283 F.3d 11, 21 (1st Cir.2002) (major life activities include \"functions such as caring for oneself, ... seeing\"); <i>Calero-Cerezo,</i> 355 F.3d at 21 (recognizing eating as a major life activity for purposes of the ADA).</p>\n<p>We cannot agree, however, that on the record before us there is any genuine issue of material fact as to whether Carreras' diabetes \"substantially limited\" his ability to eat or to see. \"The ADA does not define `substantially limits,' but `substantially' suggests `considerable' or `specified to a large degree.'\" <i>Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc.,</i> 527 U.S. 471, 491, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999), <i>superseded by statute on other grounds,</i> ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub.L. No. 110-325, 172 Stat. 3553 (2008). To be substantially limiting, an impairment must cause a person to be \"unable to perform a major life activity that an average person in the general population can perform,\" or to be significantly restricted in the performance of a particular major life activity as compared to an average person in the general population. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1); <i>see also </i><i>Carroll v. Xerox Corp.,</i> 294 F.3d 231, 239 (1st Cir.2002).<sup>[6]</sup> In assessing in this case the degree of limitation occasioned by a physical impairment, we also take into consideration \"the effectiveness, side effects and burdens of a plaintiff's mitigating measures,\" in this case Carreras' twice-daily insulin shots. <i>Rohr,</i> 555 F.3d at 859 (citing <i>Sutton,</i> 527 U.S. at 482-84, 119 S.Ct. 2139).<sup>[7]</sup> Our inquiry is \"fact-intensive and individualized.\" <i>Sepulveda v. Glickman,</i> 167 F.Supp.2d 186, 191 (D.P.R.2001); <i>Sutton,</i> 527 U.S. at 483, 119 S.Ct. 2139.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> 1. Carreras' claim that his diabetes substantially limits his vision</h2>\n<p>The facts of record fail to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Carreras' vision is substantially limited by his diabetes. Carreras asserts that high blood sugar levels cause his vision to blur, constituting a substantial limitation under the ADA. He does not contest, however, that his latest blurred vision episode occurred a year before he was deposed in this case. Nor does he set forth facts that would explain how such infrequent episodes of blurred vision cause him to be significantly restricted in his ability to see. \"To qualify as disabling, a limitation ... must be permanent or long term, and considerable compared to the [seeing] most people do in their daily lives.\" <i>Fredricksen v. United Parcel Serv., Co.,</i> 581 F.3d 516, 522 (7th Cir.2009) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The facts show that Carreras' ability to see does not differ in a significant way from the ability to see of the general population. <i>Cf. </i><i>Albertson's, Inc., v. Kirkingburg,</i> 527 U.S. 555, 565-67, 119 S.Ct. 2162, 144 L.Ed.2d 518 (1999) (finding that monocular individuals must \"prove a disability by offering evidence that the extent of the limitation in terms of their own experience, as in loss of depth perception and visual field, is substantial\"); <i>Kelly v. Drexel Univ.,</i> 94 F.3d 102, 106, 108 (3d Cir.1996) (finding plaintiff's limp and inability to walk more than a mile or jog did not \"substantially limit him in the relevant major life activity, walking\"). It is undisputed that Carreras drives his son to school and himself to work every morning, drives home again in the evening, reads as part of his current employment, and performs other routine daily activities that presumably would not be possible if his vision were substantially impaired. <i>See </i><i>Scheerer v. Potter,</i> 443 F.3d 916, 920 (7th Cir.2006) (finding diabetic with \"intermittent episodes of significant neuropathy\" not substantially limited in his ability to walk because \"he nonetheless was generally able to walk and stand during the pertinent time period\"). As described in the record, Carreras' diabetes does not limit his sight to a degree that would differentiate him from the rest of the population.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Carreras' claim that his diabetes substantially limits his eating</h2>\n<p>Carreras has also failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his diabetes substantially limits his life activity of eating. It is undisputed that Carreras' diabetes requires certain adjustments to his diet. He avoids refined flours, drinks juice that is not artificially sweetened, and eats six meals a day. Proof that a medical condition \"requires medication, a fixed meal schedule, [and] timely snack breaks,\" without more, does not amount to a \"substantial limitation\" under the ADA. <i>Sepulveda,</i> 167 F.Supp.2d at 191 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The analysis of when and under what conditions diabetes is considered a disability for ADA purposes \"is a matter of degree.\" <i>Id.</i> at 190. We recognize that living with diabetes may result in a complex calculus balancing food intake, activity level, and the amount of insulin administered. An individual living with diabetes may or may not experience a substantial limitation in his or her ability to eat as contrasted with the rest of the population. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Lawson v. CSX Transp., Inc.,</i> 245 F.3d 916, 924 (7th Cir.2001) (describing substantial limitation on eating entailed by \"perpetual, multi-faceted and demanding treatment regime\" for plaintiff's diabetes (quotation marks omitted)); <i>Rohr,</i> 555 F.3d at 859 (finding genuine issue of material fact as to whether plaintiff had a substantial impairment in eating where he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> described controlling his disease through a combination of diet and insulin as \"being on a chemical rollercoaster\" (quotation marks omitted)). Many diabetics follow a \"severely restrictive, and highly demanding\" regimen to control their disease from which any deviation could result in a trip to the emergency room. <i>See </i><i>Fraser v. Goodale,</i> 342 F.3d 1032, 1041 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p>The record indicates, however, that Carreras is at the far end of the spectrum from those plaintiffs who \"cannot put a morsel of food\" into their mouths \"without carefully assessing whether it will tip [their] blood sugar[ ]\" levels. <i>Id.</i><sup>[8]</sup> He does not dispute that his twice daily insulin shots successfully control his diabetes. <i>Cf. </i><i>Lawson,</i> 245 F.3d at 924 (finding jury question as to whether diabetic could meet the substantial limitation threshold because \"even when taking insulin, [plaintiff's] `ability to regulate his blood sugar and metabolize food is difficult, erratic, and substantially limited'\"). Indeed, the facts are that, by taking two insulin shots each day and eating fairly often, Carreras succeeds in preventing his diabetes from substantially limiting any of his major life activities. <i>Compare </i><i>Sutton,</i> 527 U.S. at 488-89, 119 S.Ct. 2139 (the wearing of corrective lenses to neutralize the effects of myopia negated substantial impairment of vision caused by plaintiff's disability) <i>with </i><i>Lawson,</i> 245 F.3d at 925-26 (the need to coordinate \"multifaceted factors\" and to maintain \"constant vigilance\" over plaintiff's insulin regimen, coupled with the grave effects of noncompliance, distinguished plaintiff's case from <i>Sutton</i>).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Summary</h2>\n<p>In summary, Carreras adduces no evidence that his diabetes causes more than minor limitations on his eating and seeing. <i>See </i><i>Rohr,</i> 555 F.3d at 860 (\"If daily insulin injections alone more or less stabilized [plaintiff's] blood sugar levels, such that any limitation imposed on his diet would be minor, then [his] major life activity of eating might not be substantially limited.\"). We therefore agree with the district court that Carreras has not raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he is disabled under the ADA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Retaliation under the ADA<sup>[9]</sup></h2>\n<p>The retaliation provision in the ADA states that \"[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). In order to establish a claim of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show (1) that he engaged in protected conduct, (2) that he suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) that there was a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action. <i>Soileau v. Guilford of Maine, Inc.,</i> 105 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.1997).<sup>[10]</sup> It is well established that \"requesting an accommodation, without filing a formal charge or engaging in other specific behaviors listed in § 12203(a), is nonetheless behavior protected from an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> employer's retaliation.\" <i>Wright v. CompUSA, Inc.,</i> 352 F.3d 472, 477-78 (1st Cir. 2003). Even if he fails to bring a successful disability claim under the ADA, a plaintiff may nonetheless assert a claim for retaliation. <i>Soileau,</i> 105 F.3d at 16.</p>\n<p>Once a plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of retaliation, \"the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision.\" <i>Wright,</i> 352 F.3d at 478 (citation and quotation marks omitted); <i>see also </i><i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 802-804, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) (establishing burden-shifting framework for Title VII cases). The employer's burden is \"one of production, not persuasion.\" <i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 142, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). If the employer produces a legitimate reason for its decision, \"the burden under <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the motive was discriminatory [or retaliatory].\" <i>Sabinson v. Trs. of Dartmouth Coll.,</i> 542 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2008) (citing <i>Reeves,</i> 530 U.S. at 142-43, 120 S.Ct. 2097); <i>see also </i><i>Kersey v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth.,</i> 586 F.3d 13, 17 (D.C.Cir.2009). Thus, the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden to create a plausible inference that the employer had a retaliatory motive. <i>Benoit v. Technical Mfg. Corp.,</i> 331 F.3d 166, 174 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>Carreras argues that his email to Ruíz and three other SGP supervisors sent on October 21, 2004, in which he informed them that he had to work late and had been prevented from taking his insulin shot, constituted a request for a reasonable accommodation under the ADA.<sup>[11]</sup> He contends that his firing on October 25, 2004 was a direct result of that request for accommodation. He asserts that he is entitled to an inference of causal connection between the two events because his termination occurred in such close temporal proximity to his engaging in protected conduct.</p>\n<p>The district court found that Carreras had not requested an accommodation within the meaning of the ADA and granted summary judgment for SGP on the claim of retaliation. We affirm that judgment, albeit on different grounds. <i>See </i><i>Estades-Negroni v. Assocs. Corp. of North Am.,</i> 377 F.3d 58, 62 (1st Cir.2004) (\"We may affirm ... on any grounds supported by the record.\").</p>\n<p>For convenience we assume, without deciding, that Carreras has made his prima facie case. As noted, once an employee has made a prima facie showing of retaliation, the burden shifts to the employer to produce evidence that there was a legitimate, non-retaliatory motive for the adverse employment action. <i>Wright,</i> 352 F.3d at 478. SGP has met its burden. SGP claims that Carreras' deficient performance and insubordination prompted the SGP partners to terminate his employment. In support of its claim, SGP introduced the email from Ruíz to Carreras. That email, written in all capital letters and dated August 25, 2004, reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING TO NOT BE ABLE TO COUNT ON YOUR PRESENCE WHEN I MOST NEED YOU. I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE UNEXPECTED, BUT IT ALWAYS HAPPENS THAT WHEN I <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> HAVE A MEETING WITH A CLIENT, I AM MISSING THE UNFINISHED MATERIAL; AND THE RESPONSIBLE PERSON HAS A PERSONAL ISSUE TO SOLVE.<sup>[12]</sup></blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>IN THE FUTURE, CALL ME DIRECTLY AT THE CELL PHONE OR AT MY HOME, AND I'LL COME AND FINISH THE ART EVEN IF I HAVE TO WORK ALL NIGHT.</blockquote>\n<p>This documentary evidence showing Ruíz's dissatisfaction with Carreras meets SGP's burden of producing evidence that demonstrates its legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for firing Carreras.</p>\n<p>In the face of such evidence, Carreras bears the ultimate burden of establishing that SGP's stated reason for his dismissal is a pretext for retaliation. <i>Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp.,</i> 217 F.3d 46, 54 (1st Cir.2000). Carreras attempts to meet this burden by pointing to what he characterizes as inconsistencies in statements given by SGP managers about the reason he was fired, when the decision to fire him was made, and why there was a delay between the making of that decision and the firing. Specifically, Carreras cites deposition testimony showing that two of three members of SGP's management recalled that the decision to terminate Carreras was made in early-to-mid October, while another thought it was made at the end of September. Further, Carreras cites deposition testimony showing that one of those managers thought there was some delay between the decision and Carreras' firing because Carreras might improve his performance in that time, a second thought it was in order to hire a replacement, and a third thought the delay involved the need to complete legal paperwork. Finally, in its Joint Initial Scheduling Conference Memorandum, SGP said the reason for Carreras' firing was that his \"output was not timely and up to the quality standards that defendant requested for him.\" By contrast, Carreras argues, Ruíz stated in his deposition that Carreras did good work, but that he was fired because of \"coworker complaints and because he was not getting his job done in time.\"<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>An employee can establish pretext \"by showing weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions <i>in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons</i> such that a factfinder could infer that the employer did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory reasons.\" <i>Id.</i> at 56 (quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis added). The minor inconsistencies cited by Carreras, however, do not undermine SGP's contention that his work performance was unsatisfactory. The slight differences in SGP's accounts of the timing of the decision or the reason for the short delay before its implementation do not permit a reasonable factfinder to infer that SGP did not fire Carreras because of his poor work performance. The evidence was consistent on the essential point, i.e., that Carreras' work was untimely and therefore unsatisfactory. Our laws are designed to ensure against discrimination and retaliation, not \"inaccuracy by an employer.\" <i>Rivas Rosado v. Radio Shack, Inc.,</i> 312 F.3d 532, 535 (1st Cir.2002). Moreover, the dissatisfaction with Carreras was expressed in writing two months <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> before he complained about having to work late and was fired. This is not a case in which the employer's \"nondiscriminatory reasons were after-the-fact justifications, provided subsequent to the beginning of legal action.\" <i>Santiago-Ramos,</i> 217 F.3d at 56.</p>\n<p>In the final analysis, the only evidence in the summary judgment record supporting Carreras' retaliation claim is the temporal proximity between his October 21, 2004 email to Ruíz and his firing on October 25, 2004. Such temporal proximity may suffice for a prima facie case of retaliation. It does not satisfy Carreras' ultimate burden to establish that the true explanation for his firing was retaliation for engaging in protected conduct rather than poor performance. <i>See Holloway,</i> 275 Fed.Appx at 27 (suspicions raised by temporal proximity \"can be authoritatively dispelled ... by an employer's convincing account of the legitimate reasons for the firing\"); <i>see also </i><i>Soileau,</i> 105 F.3d at 16-17 (rejecting claim of retaliation based solely on temporal proximity). We affirm the entry of summary judgment for SGP on Carreras' retaliation claim under the ADA.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Although Carreras characterizes Ruíz's email as a tantrum, he does not deny that it was sent and that he replied.</p>\n<p>[2]  SGP's personnel manual listed working hours as 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., but expressly stated that working hours are irregular in the advertising industry and that all employees must be available when necessary during and/or after normal hours. The only storage requirement for Carreras' insulin was refrigeration. SGP had a refrigerator available to employees at its offices.</p>\n<p>[3]  Carreras argues that, despite its assertion to the contrary, the district court rejected his entire response to SGP's Statement of Uncontested Facts. We disagree. In its recitation of the facts, set forth in a portion of the opinion entitled \"Uncontested Facts,\" the district court made clear which facts it considered to be uncontested with citations to the record signifying that certain of those facts were derived from SGP's Statement of Uncontested Facts. As noted, the court's focus in this recitation was on Carreras' workplace discrimination claim, not his retaliation claim. The district court was under no obligation to go beyond the relevant facts, as it saw them, in order to catalogue the sufficiency of Carreras' opposition to every one of SGP's proposed facts.</p>\n<p>[4]  \"A `genuine' issue is one that could be resolved in favor of either party, and a `material fact' is one that has the potential of affecting the outcome of the case.\" <i>Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,</i> 355 F.3d 6, 19 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>[5]  Although Carreras states on appeal that he was regarded as having an impairment, he did not assert this argument below and we deem it to be waived. Even if Carreras had not waived this argument below, it would fail here because his brief contains no support for the claim. As we have explained on many occasions, \"`[i]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.'\" <i>United States v. Rivera Calderon,</i> 578 F.3d 78, 94 n. 4 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p>[6]  In considering whether a litigant's physical impairment is substantially limiting for purposes of the ADA, the inquiry is not confined to limitations that might occur in the workplace. <i>Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams,</i> 534 U.S. 184, 200-01, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002), <i>superseded by statute on other grounds,</i> ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub.L. No. 110-325, 172 Stat. 3553 (2008). Rather, courts must focus on whether a major life activity is substantially impaired in the course of a litigant's daily life. <i>Id.</i> at 200-02.</p>\n<p>[7]  Carreras has made no argument about the effect of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 on his claim. <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 110-325, § 2(a)(4)-(6), 122 Stat. 3553 (2008). Regardless, that law is not retroactive where, as here, the disputed activity occurred before its passage and Congress expressed no clear intent to make the statute retroactive. We have recently suggested as much, <i>see </i><i>Thornton v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.,</i> 587 F.3d 27, 34 n. 3 (1st Cir.2009), and all circuits to consider the issue to date have so held. <i>See </i><i>Becerril v. Pima County Assessor's Office,</i> 587 F.3d 1162, 1164 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam); <i>Fredericksen v. United Parcel Serv.,</i> 581 F.3d 516, 521 n. 1 (7th Cir.2009); <i>Lytes v. DC Water &amp; Sewer Auth.,</i> 572 F.3d 936, 940 (D.C.Cir.2009); <i>Milholland v. Summer County Bd. of Educ.,</i> 569 F.3d 562 (6th Cir.2009); <i>E.E.O.C. v. Agro Distribution, LLC,</i> 555 F.3d 462, 469 n. 8 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>[8]  Carreras' complaint states that failure to take his insulin causes headaches and an undefined \"loss of control of his condition.\"</p>\n<p>[9]  We note that the district court did not circumscribe the summary judgment record with a deeming order that applies to the retaliation claim.</p>\n<p>[10]  In <i>Soileau,</i> we explained that because of the relatedness of the two statutes, \"guidance on the proper analysis of [an] ADA retaliation claim is found in Title VII cases.\" 105 F.3d at 16. We therefore refer to cases interpreting Title VII's retaliation provision as well as those specifically addressing the ADA in conducting our analysis of Carreras' retaliation claim.</p>\n<p>[11]  Carreras attempts to argue, in the alternative, that his email somehow constituted opposition to his employer's \"interfer[ence] with the treatment for his diabetes,\" and that such opposition is protected conduct under the ADA. This claim is undeveloped and therefore waived. Even if it were not, our analysis of the retaliation claim would be the same.</p>\n<p>[12]  From Carreras' response to this email, which is also in the record, we deduce that the \"personal issue\" to which Ruíz refers was Carreras' failure to come to work on time because he did not have his glasses.</p>\n<p>[13]  Carreras also cites the lack of \"written evidence\" of any deficiencies in his performance during the months preceding his firing. In making this argument, Carreras overlooks the August 2004 email from Ruíz.</p>\n<p>[14]  We also affirm the district court's dismissal without prejudice of Carreras' claims arising under Puerto Rico law. <i>See </i><i>Penobscot Indian Nation v. Key Bank of Maine,</i> 112 F.3d 538, 564 (1st Cir.1997) (\"[T]he decision to retain or disclaim jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims at issue in this case lies in the broad discretion of the district court.\")</p>\n\n</div>",

On this basis, it deemed as admitted portions of defendant Sajo, García &amp; Partners' (\"SGP\") statement of uncontested facts and granted summary judgment to defendant. Carreras argues on appeal that the district court improperly invoked Local Rule 56 and erred in rejecting his claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213 (\"ADA\"), and various Puerto Rico anti-discrimination laws. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We begin with a recitation of the basic facts underlying the dispute, derived from the facts explicitly admitted by Carreras. SGP, a marketing agency, hired Carreras as an Art Director in December 2003. Carreras' responsibilities included preparing the creative art for products being marketed by SGP. In August 2004, Carreras <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> and Sajo Ruíz, an SGP partner, exchanged heated emails about Carreras' alleged failure to complete work on time.<sup>[1]</sup> Carreras has type II diabetes, which he controls by taking insulin every morning and evening. At the commencement of his employment with SGP, Carreras filled out a form on which he indicated that he had diabetes and was dependent on insulin.</p>\n<p>On October 21, 2004, Carreras emailed Ruíz informing him that he had worked late that evening and had been prevented from taking his insulin shot. Ruíz replied the next morning asking Carreras to clarify what had prevented him from taking his medicine and stating that there should be no obstacle to Carreras taking his treatment. In response, Carreras stated that he was prevented from administering his medicine because he had to stay late at the office.<sup>[2]</sup> SGP terminated Carreras' employment on October 25, 2004.</p>\n<p>Carreras filed suit against SGP alleging that he had experienced discrimination based on his disability and retaliation for requesting a reasonable accommodation in violation of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213. After discovery was complete, SGP moved for summary judgment and filed a separate Statement of Uncontested Facts in support of its motion. In response, Carreras submitted a document styled as \"Plaintiff's Response and Objections to Defendant's Proposed Statement of Uncontested Facts.\" The district court found that statement to be defective under Puerto Rico Local Rule 56 because it failed to admit, qualify or deny certain facts proposed by SGP, it did not contain a separate section for the new facts it sought to introduce, and it did not contain appropriate citation to the record to support denied facts.</p>\n<p>In accordance with the anti-ferret rule, the district court disregarded those portions of Carreras' opposition it found defective and deemed as admitted many of SGP's properly supported facts. <i>See</i> D.P.R.R. 56(e). With its recitation of the facts in its written opinion, the district court made clear the facts it deemed admitted. The court focused primarily on those facts pertaining to the effect, or lack thereof, of Carreras' diabetes on his work and daily life. In a footnote, the court explained that \"the reason for [Carreras'] dismissal is in dispute. However, because it is immaterial for the resolution of this case, we will eschew any discussion in this regard.\" Hence, the court's recitation of \"Uncontested Facts\" in its opinion, where it sets forth the effect of its deeming analysis on the summary judgment record, does not focus on the retaliation claim.</p>\n<p>After making its deeming determination, the district court granted summary judgment to SGP based on Carreras' failure to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA. The court noted, however, that even if Carreras qualified as disabled, his arguments that SGP failed to accommodate his disability must fail because Carreras had neither requested nor been denied accommodation. For the same reason, the district court rejected Carreras' claim that he was retaliated against for making a request for reasonable accommodation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> Carreras appeals, contending that his statement complied with the local rule and that the district court erred in granting summary judgment based on its deeming order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Carreras argues that the district court improperly applied Local Rule 56(c), the District of Puerto Rico's anti-ferret rule. The rule states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>A party opposing a motion for summary judgment shall submit with its opposition a separate, short, and concise statement of material facts. The opposing statement shall admit, deny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material facts and unless a fact is admitted, shall support each denial or qualification by a record citation as required by this rule. The opposing statement may contain in a separate section additional facts, set forth in separate numbered paragraphs and supported by a record citation as required by subsection (e) of this rule.</blockquote>\n<p>D.P.R.R. 56(c). Subsection (e) of the rule states that citations must be \"to the specific page or paragraph of identified record material supporting the assertion.\" D.P.R.R. 56(e). Failure to comply with the anti-ferret rule permits the court to \"disregard any statement of fact not supported by a specific citation to record material properly considered on summary judgment.\" D.P.R.R. 56(e). We review the district court's application of a local rule for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Sánchez-Figueroa v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1458137\"><a href=\"/opinion/1458137/sanchez-figueroa-v-banco-popular-de-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span>, 213 (1st Cir.2008). While a district court may choose not to invoke the rule in response to every violation, we have consistently upheld the enforcement of the rule, and we treat the district court's decision to apply it with deference. <i>See </i><i>CMI Capital Market Inv. v. González-Toro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203192\"><a href=\"/opinion/203192/cmi-capital-market-v-gonzalez-toro/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 62-63 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Mariani-Colón v.

The rule is intended \"to relieve the district court of any responsibility to ferret through the record to discern whether any material fact is genuinely in dispute.\" <i>CMI Capital Market,</i> 520 F.3d at 62. It prevents parties from \"improperly shift[ing] the burden of organizing the evidence presented in a given case to the district court.\" <i>Mariani-Colón,</i> 511 F.3d at 219. As such, the rule is important to the functioning of the district court.</p>\n<p>Here, Carreras did submit a response to SGP's Statement of Uncontested Facts. Although he argues that his response properly accepted or denied every fact with appropriate citation, Carreras properly denied only certain of SGP's facts. Accordingly, the district court stated that it would \"<i>partially</i> disregard\" Carreras' opposing statement of uncontested facts.<sup>[3]</sup> The record shows that in many instances Carreras' response manifestly ignores the express requirements of the anti-ferret rule. Most blatantly, in at least two instances, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> Carreras' opposition fails to \"accept, qualify or deny\" the fact listed by his opponent. Instead, it explains discursively why Carreras believes the fact to be irrelevant. Furthermore, Carreras' opposition frequently fails to support denied facts with appropriate citation to the record.</p>\n<p>Finally, Carreras' response includes argumentation asserting numerous additional facts. Those facts are often unsupported by record citations, they are not numbered, and they are not \"contain[ed] in a separate section.\" Carreras' argument that the rule does not require additional facts to be adduced in a separate section is unavailing. The plain language of the rule specifically requires that additional facts be put forward in a \"separate section.\" D.P.R.R. 56(c). In light of these substantial failings, the district court acted well within its discretion when it deemed as admitted a portion of SGP's properly supported facts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>To survive summary judgment on his discrimination and retaliation claims, Carreras must establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he experienced disability discrimination or was retaliated-against within the meaning of the ADA. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).<sup>[4]</sup> Our review of the district court's grant of summary judgment is de novo. <i>Cabán-Hernández,</i> 486 F.3d at 8. We \"draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.\" <i>Id.</i> We will not, however, \"draw <i>unreasonable</i> inferences or credit bald assertions, empty conclusions, [or] rank conjecture.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Disability Discrimination under the ADA</h2>\n<p>The district court found that Carreras failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA because he could not establish that he is disabled within the meaning of the statute. Under the ADA, a disability is defined as: (a) a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of an individual's major life activities; (b) a record of such impairment; or (c) being regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1).<sup>[5]</sup> We have employed a three-part test to determine whether an individual qualifies as disabled under the first definition, which is at issue here. First, does the plaintiff suffer a mental or physical impairment? Second, does the life activity limited by the impairment qualify as \"major\"? And finally, does the impairment, in fact, substantially limit that major life activity? <i>See </i><i>Calero-Cerezo,</i> 355 F.3d at 20. The burden is on the plaintiff to establish these three elements. <i>Id.</i> Carreras contends that he is disabled because his diabetes is a physical impairment that substantially limits his ability to eat and see, two major life activities.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> We must determine the existence of a disability \"on a case-by-case basis.\" <i>Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118314\"><a href=\"/opinion/118314/albertsons-inc-v-kirkingburg/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 566, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118314\"><a href=\"/opinion/118314/albertsons-inc-v-kirkingburg/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, we must assess the effect of Carreras' alleged impairment on his life, rather than relying on his diagnoses alone, in order to determine whether he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA. <i>Id.</i> We agree with Carreras that insulin-dependent diabetes is a physical impairment. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rohr v.

Carreras asserts that high blood sugar levels cause his vision to blur, constituting a substantial limitation under the ADA. He does not contest, however, that his latest blurred vision episode occurred a year before he was deposed in this case. Nor does he set forth facts that would explain how such infrequent episodes of blurred vision cause him to be significantly restricted in his ability to see. \"To qualify as disabling, a limitation ... must be permanent or long term, and considerable compared to the [seeing] most people do in their daily lives.\" <i>Fredricksen v.

It is undisputed that Carreras drives his son to school and himself to work every morning, drives home again in the evening, reads as part of his current employment, and performs other routine daily activities that presumably would not be possible if his vision were substantially impaired. <i>See </i><i>Scheerer v.

As described in the record, Carreras' diabetes does not limit his sight to a degree that would differentiate him from the rest of the population.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Carreras' claim that his diabetes substantially limits his eating</h2>\n<p>Carreras has also failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his diabetes substantially limits his life activity of eating. It is undisputed that Carreras' diabetes requires certain adjustments to his diet. He avoids refined flours, drinks juice that is not artificially sweetened, and eats six meals a day. Proof that a medical condition \"requires medication, a fixed meal schedule, [and] timely snack breaks,\" without more, does not amount to a \"substantial limitation\" under the ADA. <i>Sepulveda,</i> 167 F.Supp.2d at 191 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The analysis of when and under what conditions diabetes is considered a disability for ADA purposes \"is a matter of degree.\" <i>Id.</i> at 190. We recognize that living with diabetes may result in a complex calculus balancing food intake, activity level, and the amount of insulin administered. An individual living with diabetes may or may not experience a substantial limitation in his or her ability to eat as contrasted with the rest of the population. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Lawson v. CSX Transp., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772738\"><a href=\"/opinion/772738/john-lawson-sr-v-csx-transportation-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></a></span>, 924 (7th Cir.2001) (describing substantial limitation on eating entailed by \"perpetual, multi-faceted and demanding treatment regime\" for plaintiff's diabetes (quotation marks omitted)); <i>Rohr,</i> 555 F.3d at 859 (finding genuine issue of material fact as to whether plaintiff had a substantial impairment in eating where he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> described controlling his disease through a combination of diet and insulin as \"being on a chemical rollercoaster\" (quotation marks omitted)). Many diabetics follow a \"severely restrictive, and highly demanding\" regimen to control their disease from which any deviation could result in a trip to the emergency room. <i>See </i><i>Fraser v. Goodale,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783489\"><a href=\"/opinion/783489/rebecca-ann-fraser-v-carol-goodale-jeff-erwin-terri-mckinnis-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1032</span></a></span>, 1041 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p>The record indicates, however, that Carreras is at the far end of the spectrum from those plaintiffs who \"cannot put a morsel of food\" into their mouths \"without carefully assessing whether it will tip [their] blood sugar[ ]\" levels. <i>Id.</i><sup>[8]</sup> He does not dispute that his twice daily insulin shots successfully control his diabetes. <i>Cf. </i><i>Lawson,</i> 245 F.3d at 924 (finding jury question as to whether diabetic could meet the substantial limitation threshold because \"even when taking insulin, [plaintiff's] `ability to regulate his blood sugar and metabolize food is difficult, erratic, and substantially limited'\"). Indeed, the facts are that, by taking two insulin shots each day and eating fairly often, Carreras succeeds in preventing his diabetes from substantially limiting any of his major life activities. <i>Compare </i><i>Sutton,</i> 527 U.S. at 488-89, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118311\"><a href=\"/opinion/118311/sutton-v-united-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Summary</h2>\n<p>In summary, Carreras adduces no evidence that his diabetes causes more than minor limitations on his eating and seeing. <i>See </i><i>Rohr,</i> 555 F.3d at 860 (\"If daily insulin injections alone more or less stabilized [plaintiff's] blood sugar levels, such that any limitation imposed on his diet would be minor, then [his] major life activity of eating might not be substantially limited.\"). We therefore agree with the district court that Carreras has not raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he is disabled under the ADA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Retaliation under the ADA<sup>[9]</sup></h2>\n<p>The retaliation provision in the ADA states that \"[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). In order to establish a claim of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show (1) that he engaged in protected conduct, (2) that he suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) that there was a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action. <i>Soileau v. Guilford of Maine, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197175\"><a href=\"/opinion/197175/soileau-v-guilford-of-me/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1997).<sup>[10]</sup> It is well established that \"requesting an accommodation, without filing a formal charge or engaging in other specific behaviors listed in § 12203(a), is nonetheless behavior protected from an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> employer's retaliation.\" <i>Wright v.

Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200493\"><a href=\"/opinion/200493/benoit-v-technical/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span>, 174 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>Carreras argues that his email to Ruíz and three other SGP supervisors sent on October 21, 2004, in which he informed them that he had to work late and had been prevented from taking his insulin shot, constituted a request for a reasonable accommodation under the ADA.<sup>[11]</sup> He contends that his firing on October 25, 2004 was a direct result of that request for accommodation. He asserts that he is entitled to an inference of causal connection between the two events because his termination occurred in such close temporal proximity to his engaging in protected conduct.</p>\n<p>The district court found that Carreras had not requested an accommodation within the meaning of the ADA and granted summary judgment for SGP on the claim of retaliation. We affirm that judgment, albeit on different grounds. <i>See </i><i>Estades-Negroni v. Assocs. Corp. of North Am.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></span>, 62 (1st Cir.2004) (\"We may affirm ... on any grounds supported by the record.\").</p>\n<p>For convenience we assume, without deciding, that Carreras has made his prima facie case. As noted, once an employee has made a prima facie showing of retaliation, the burden shifts to the employer to produce evidence that there was a legitimate, non-retaliatory motive for the adverse employment action. <i>Wright,</i> 352 F.3d at 478. SGP has met its burden. SGP claims that Carreras' deficient performance and insubordination prompted the SGP partners to terminate his employment. In support of its claim, SGP introduced the email from Ruíz to Carreras. That email, written in all capital letters and dated August 25, 2004, reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING TO NOT BE ABLE TO COUNT ON YOUR PRESENCE WHEN I MOST NEED YOU. I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE UNEXPECTED, BUT IT ALWAYS HAPPENS THAT WHEN I <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> HAVE A MEETING WITH A CLIENT, I AM MISSING THE UNFINISHED MATERIAL; AND THE RESPONSIBLE PERSON HAS A PERSONAL ISSUE TO SOLVE.<sup>[12]</sup></blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>IN THE FUTURE, CALL ME DIRECTLY AT THE CELL PHONE OR AT MY HOME, AND I'LL COME AND FINISH THE ART EVEN IF I HAVE TO WORK ALL NIGHT.</blockquote>\n<p>This documentary evidence showing Ruíz's dissatisfaction with Carreras meets SGP's burden of producing evidence that demonstrates its legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for firing Carreras.</p>\n<p>In the face of such evidence, Carreras bears the ultimate burden of establishing that SGP's stated reason for his dismissal is a pretext for retaliation. <i>Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198991\"><a href=\"/opinion/198991/santiago-ramos-v-centennial-pr-wire/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.2000). Carreras attempts to meet this burden by pointing to what he characterizes as inconsistencies in statements given by SGP managers about the reason he was fired, when the decision to fire him was made, and why there was a delay between the making of that decision and the firing. Specifically, Carreras cites deposition testimony showing that two of three members of SGP's management recalled that the decision to terminate Carreras was made in early-to-mid October, while another thought it was made at the end of September. Further, Carreras cites deposition testimony showing that one of those managers thought there was some delay between the decision and Carreras' firing because Carreras might improve his performance in that time, a second thought it was in order to hire a replacement, and a third thought the delay involved the need to complete legal paperwork. Finally, in its Joint Initial Scheduling Conference Memorandum, SGP said the reason for Carreras' firing was that his \"output was not timely and up to the quality standards that defendant requested for him.\" By contrast, Carreras argues, Ruíz stated in his deposition that Carreras did good work, but that he was fired because of \"coworker complaints and because he was not getting his job done in time.\"<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>An employee can establish pretext \"by showing weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions <i>in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons</i> such that a factfinder could infer that the employer did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory reasons.\" <i>Id.</i> at 56 (quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis added). The minor inconsistencies cited by Carreras, however, do not undermine SGP's contention that his work performance was unsatisfactory. The slight differences in SGP's accounts of the timing of the decision or the reason for the short delay before its implementation do not permit a reasonable factfinder to infer that SGP did not fire Carreras because of his poor work performance. The evidence was consistent on the essential point, i.e., that Carreras' work was untimely and therefore unsatisfactory. Our laws are designed to ensure against discrimination and retaliation, not \"inaccuracy by an employer.\" <i>Rivas Rosado v. Radio Shack, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200242\"><a href=\"/opinion/200242/rivas-rosado-v-radio-shack-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span>, 535 (1st Cir.2002). Moreover, the dissatisfaction with Carreras was expressed in writing two months <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> before he complained about having to work late and was fired. This is not a case in which the employer's \"nondiscriminatory reasons were after-the-fact justifications, provided subsequent to the beginning of legal action.\" <i>Santiago-Ramos,</i> 217 F.3d at 56.</p>\n<p>In the final analysis, the only evidence in the summary judgment record supporting Carreras' retaliation claim is the temporal proximity between his October 21, 2004 email to Ruíz and his firing on October 25, 2004. Such temporal proximity may suffice for a prima facie case of retaliation. It does not satisfy Carreras' ultimate burden to establish that the true explanation for his firing was retaliation for engaging in protected conduct rather than poor performance. <i>See Holloway,</i> 275 Fed.Appx at 27 (suspicions raised by temporal proximity \"can be authoritatively dispelled ... by an employer's convincing account of the legitimate reasons for the firing\"); <i>see also </i><i>Soileau,</i> 105 F.3d at 16-17 (rejecting claim of retaliation based solely on temporal proximity). We affirm the entry of summary judgment for SGP on Carreras' retaliation claim under the ADA.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Although Carreras characterizes Ruíz's email as a tantrum, he does not deny that it was sent and that he replied.</p>\n<p>[2]  SGP's personnel manual listed working hours as 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., but expressly stated that working hours are irregular in the advertising industry and that all employees must be available when necessary during and/or after normal hours. The only storage requirement for Carreras' insulin was refrigeration. SGP had a refrigerator available to employees at its offices.</p>\n<p>[3]  Carreras argues that, despite its assertion to the contrary, the district court rejected his entire response to SGP's Statement of Uncontested Facts. We disagree. In its recitation of the facts, set forth in a portion of the opinion entitled \"Uncontested Facts,\" the district court made clear which facts it considered to be uncontested with citations to the record signifying that certain of those facts were derived from SGP's Statement of Uncontested Facts. As noted, the court's focus in this recitation was on Carreras' workplace discrimination claim, not his retaliation claim. The district court was under no obligation to go beyond the relevant facts, as it saw them, in order to catalogue the sufficiency of Carreras' opposition to every one of SGP's proposed facts.</p>\n<p>[4]  \"A `genuine' issue is one that could be resolved in favor of either party, and a `material fact' is one that has the potential of affecting the outcome of the case.\" <i>Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201012\"><a href=\"/opinion/201012/calero-cerezo-v-us-dep-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>[5]  Although Carreras states on appeal that he was regarded as having an impairment, he did not assert this argument below and we deem it to be waived. Even if Carreras had not waived this argument below, it would fail here because his brief contains no support for the claim. As we have explained on many occasions, \"`[i]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.'\" <i>United States v. Rivera Calderon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203972\"><a href=\"/opinion/203972/united-states-v-rivera-calderon/\"><span class=\"volume\">578</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 94 n. 4 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting <i>United States v.

Rather, courts must focus on whether a major life activity is substantially impaired in the course of a litigant's daily life. <i>Id.</i> at 200-02.</p>\n<p>[7]  Carreras has made no argument about the effect of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 on his claim. <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 110-325, § 2(a)(4)-(6), 122 Stat. 3553 (2008). Regardless, that law is not retroactive where, as here, the disputed activity occurred before its passage and Congress expressed no clear intent to make the statute retroactive. We have recently suggested as much, <i>see </i><i>Thornton v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204062\"><a href=\"/opinion/204062/thornton-v-united-parcel-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 34 n. 3 (1st Cir.2009), and all circuits to consider the issue to date have so held. <i>See </i><i>Becerril v.

We therefore refer to cases interpreting Title VII's retaliation provision as well as those specifically addressing the ADA in conducting our analysis of Carreras' retaliation claim.</p>\n<p>[11]  Carreras attempts to argue, in the alternative, that his email somehow constituted opposition to his employer's \"interfer[ence] with the treatment for his diabetes,\" and that such opposition is protected conduct under the ADA. This claim is undeveloped and therefore waived. Even if it were not, our analysis of the retaliation claim would be the same.</p>\n<p>[12]  From Carreras' response to this email, which is also in the record, we deduce that the \"personal issue\" to which Ruíz refers was Carreras' failure to come to work on time because he did not have his glasses.</p>\n<p>[13]  Carreras also cites the lack of \"written evidence\" of any deficiencies in his performance during the months preceding his firing. In making this argument, Carreras overlooks the August 2004 email from Ruíz.</p>\n<p>[14]  We also affirm the district court's dismissal without prejudice of Carreras' claims arising under Puerto Rico law. <i>See </i><i>Penobscot Indian Nation v.
