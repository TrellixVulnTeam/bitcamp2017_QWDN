In this immigration case, petitioner Onan\n\nFlores-Coreas, a citizen of El Salvador, seeks judicial review of\n\na final decree of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dated\n\nApril 3, 2007.      That decree affirmed a decision of an immigration\n\njudge   (IJ)    declaring    the   petitioner    ineligible    for    asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and/or protection under the United Nations\n\nConvention Against Torture (CAT).          For the reasons that follow, we\n\ndeny the petition.\n\n            The relevant facts are straightforward.         The petitioner,\n\nnow in his late twenties, was born in El Salvador.            After spending\n\nmuch of his childhood there, he lived for a period of time in the\n\nUnited States.      He then repaired to El Salvador.          The events at\n\nissue in this proceeding transpired after he had returned to his\n\nhomeland.\n\n            The IJ credited the petitioner's testimony, so we start\n\nthere. The petitioner testified to a number of negative encounters\n\nwith gang members in El Salvador from and after 1999.                    These\n\nencounters included a robbery and a concomitant assault, at least\n\none attempt to recruit him as a gang member, efforts to extort\n\nmoney, and a variety of threats.        The petitioner attributed these\n\nmaraudings     to   his   active   membership   in   a   liberal     apostolic\n\nChristian church (El Salvador is a largely Catholic country) and to\n\nhis refusal to join a gang.         He also admitted, however, that (i)\n\nthe gangs aspired to recruit individuals who, like himself, owned\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fautomobiles, and (ii) the gangs also aspired to recruit individuals\n\nwho, like himself, had lived in the continental United States\n\n(assuming that such individuals had money).\n\n            The adverse experiences chronicled by the petitioner\n\nspanned a three-year period from 1999 to the end of 2001.                After\n\nthat, he hid in his house but still could not escape the gangs'\n\nunrequited attention.\n\n            The dénouement occurred in 2003.          On one occasion during\n\nthat year, gang members came to the petitioner's home after a\n\ndrinking spree and waited for him to emerge.           They left when others\n\ntold them (falsely) that the petitioner was not there.\n\n            A month later, the petitioner fled.               He entered the\n\nUnited States, without inspection, at or near Columbus, New Mexico,\n\naround November 7, 2003.         He was immediately detained, and the\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings.                In\n\ndue course, the petitioner conceded removability and cross-applied\n\nfor asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.\n\n            Following an evidentiary hearing, the IJ concluded that\n\nthe petitioner's testimony was credible but that he had failed to\n\nestablish    that   he   was   targeted    by   the   gangs   because   of   his\n\nreligious or political beliefs.             In the IJ's view, the gangs\n\nappeared to be harassing the petitioner because of his perceived\n\naffluence.    Thus, the petitioner had not carried the burden of\n\ndemonstrating a nexus between the claimed persecution (the gangs'\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\foffensive    conduct)      and    a    characteristic    protected      under   the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act.\n\n            The    IJ   also     found    that     although   gang    members   had\n\naddressed some threats to the petitioner concerning his refusal to\n\njoin their ranks, these threats were neither \"of an escalating\n\nnature\" nor \"severe.\"       As to the fact that the petitioner had been\n\nphysically assaulted on one occasion, the IJ noted that the assault\n\ntranspired \"in connection with being robbed.\"                 In sum, the series\n\nof incidents that had occurred did not add up to persecution.\n\n            Based on these and other findings, the IJ denied all\n\nthree forms of requested relief.            On appeal, the BIA affirmed the\n\nIJ's decision, stating that the petitioner had \"failed to establish\n\nthat the gangs in El Salvador, who attempted to rob him and extort\n\nmoney from him, were motivated by his political opinion, imputed\n\npolitical opinion, religion, or another protected ground, rather\n\nthan by financial gain.\"          In addition, the BIA observed that the\n\npetitioner had not established that the gangs were working with the\n\ngovernment    or    that    the       government    lacked    power   over   them.\n\nConsequently, the petitioner's generalized fear that he would fall\n\nprey to gang violence should he be returned to El Salvador did not\n\nrender him eligible either for protection under the CAT or for any\n\nother relief.\n\n            Once the BIA ruled that the petitioner had failed to\n\nsatisfy the requirements for asylum, withholding of removal, or\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fprotection under the CAT, the petitioner filed this petition for\n\njudicial    review.        The   petition    is    timely,    see    8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1252(b)(1), and we have jurisdiction to entertain it under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252, as amended.\n\n            We    begin    our   substantive      analysis   by     examining the\n\npetitioner's      asylum   claim.     To    qualify   for    asylum,     an   alien\n\ninitially must establish his status as a refugee, that is, a person\n\nwho is unable or unwilling to return to his homeland \"because of\n\npersecution . . . on account of race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\"                   8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421,\n\n428 (1987); Jiang v. Gonzales, 474 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n\"Persecution is a protean term, not defined by statute.\"                  Lopez de\n\nHincapie v. Gonzales, 494 F.3d 213, 217 (1st Cir. 2007).                       \"One\n\nelement in the decisional calculus involves the degree of the harm\n\ninflicted    or    threatened.\"       Id.      To    sink    to   the    level    of\n\npersecution, \"the sum of an alien's experiences must add up to more\n\nthan ordinary harassment, mistreatment, or suffering.\"                   Id.; see\n\nBocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 263 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Given a sufficient showing of harm, an alien can base an\n\nasylum claim on a showing that he has been persecuted in the past\n\nor, alternatively, that he harbors a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.      See Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).   In either event, however, he must show a nexus between the\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fharm (whether past or threatened) and one of the five statutorily\n\nprotected grounds. See, e.g., Raza v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 125, 128-\n\n29 (1st Cir. 2007); Makhoul, 387 F.3d at 79.    To accomplish this\n\nfeat, the petitioner must \"provide sufficient evidence to forge an\n\nactual connection between the harm and some statutorily protected\n\nground.\"   Lopez de Hincapie, 494 F.3d at 218; see Da Silva v.\n\nAshcroft 394 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2005); see also 8 C.F.R. §\n\n208.13(b)(1).\n\n           The question of whether persecution is on account of one\n\nof the five statutorily protected grounds is factbound.   Hence, we\n\nreview the BIA's answer to that question through the prism of the\n\nsubstantial evidence rule. See Lopez de Hincapie, 494 F.3d at 218.\n\n\"This is a highly deferential standard, under which we must uphold\n\nthe BIA's determination as long as that determination is 'supported\n\nby reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.'\"   Id. (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502\n\nU.S. 478, 481 (1992)).     \"That the record supports a conclusion\n\ncontrary to that reached by the BIA is not enough to warrant\n\nupsetting the BIA's view of the matter; for that to occur, the\n\nrecord must compel the contrary conclusion.\"    Id. (citing Elias-\n\nZacarias, 502 U.S. at 481 n.1)(emphasis in original); see 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(b)(4)(B) (mandating that, in this context, \"administrative\n\nfindings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator\n\nwould be compelled to conclude to the contrary\").\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f          Here, the petitioner tries to connect the gangs' unruly\n\nconduct to his religious persuasion (membership in an apostolic\n\nChristian church) or, alternatively, to his political opinion\n\n(imputed from his refusal to join a gang).          But he weaves these\n\nconnections out of the gossamer strands of speculation and surmise.\n\nIn support, he offers only his personal (subjective) conviction and\n\nweak circumstantial evidence that either or both of these reasons\n\nspurred the gangs' actions. Hard evidence of the required nexus is\n\nconspicuously absent.\n\n          We add, moreover, that what evidence exists in the record\n\ninvites the inference that the gangs targeted the petitioner\n\nbecause of greed, not religion or politics.          That inference is\n\nreinforced by its plausibility: gangs typically are composed of\n\ncommon criminals who are apt to resort to force to accomplish their\n\nnefarious ends.    See Romilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).   Even reading the record with a charitable eye, the gangs'\n\nactions (as the petitioner describes them) could just as easily\n\nhave been prompted by a desire to extort money as by any motive\n\nconnected to a statutorily protected ground. That state of affairs\n\nleaves   us   no   principled   choice   but   to    uphold   the   BIA's\n\ndetermination.1    After all, where the record admits of plausible\n\n\n\n     1\n      Because this ground suffices to sustain the denial of the\nclaim for asylum, we need not consider the BIA's alternative\nholding that the conduct complained of, though harassing, did not\nsink to the level of persecution.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fbut conflicting inferences, the agency's choice between those\n\ninferences is necessarily supported by substantial evidence.                          See\n\nBocova, 412 F.3d at 264; Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 571\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            Let us be perfectly clear.              We are not without empathy\n\nfor the petitioner's plight.             Gang violence apparently is endemic\n\nin El Salvador, and the events described by the petitioner paint an\n\nunattractive picture.           But the substantial evidence rule demands\n\nthat we uphold the agency's determination unless the evidence\n\n\"points   unerringly       in     the    opposite     direction.\"           Laurent    v.\n\nAshcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 2004).                     The evidence here does\n\nnot   approach    that    level     of    certitude       in    connection     with   the\n\nputative relationship between the gangs' menacing actions and the\n\npetitioner's religious and/or political beliefs.\n\n            We need not linger long over the petitioner's claim for\n\nwithholding      of    removal.         Although    the    tests      for   asylum    and\n\nwithholding      of    removal    differ    somewhat,          the   \"on    account   of\"\n\nrequirement is embedded identically in each formulation.                        See INS\n\nv.    Stevic,    467    U.S.     420,    429-30    (1984).           Accordingly,     the\n\npetitioner's failure to establish a nexus between the conduct\n\ncomplained of and some statutorily protected ground serves equally\n\nto defeat his withholding of removal claim.                      See, e.g., Lopez de\n\nHincapie, 494 F.3d at 220.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f          This leaves the petitioner's CAT claim. Unlike his other\n\ntwo claims, this claim does not embody an \"on account of\" element.\n\nAn alien can prevail on a CAT claim simply by showing that, more\n\nlikely than not, he will be tortured if repatriated.             See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.16(c)(2); see also Ang v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir.\n\n2005). He need not establish a nexus between the predicted torture\n\nand some statutorily protected ground.\n\n          We   review   the   BIA's    disposition   of    a   CAT   claim   by\n\napplication of the substantial evidence rule.              See Settenda v.\n\nAshcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004).      Thus, we must honor the\n\nBIA's resolution of the petitioner's CAT claim unless the evidence\n\ncompels us to reach a different conclusion.          Id.       The petitioner\n\ncannot surmount this hurdle.\n\n          In order to qualify for protection under the CAT, an\n\nalien must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he will\n\nbe tortured if returned to his country of origin.                 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1208.16(c)(2).   For purposes of the CAT, \"[t]orture is defined as\n\nany act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or\n\nmental, is intentionally inflicted on a person . . . by or at the\n\n. . . acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in\n\nan official capacity.\"    Id. § 208.18(a)(1).        Passing the question\n\nof whether the actions of which the petitioner complains can be\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fequated with torture,2 there is nothing in the record that compels\n\nthe conclusion that the petitioner, if remitted to his homeland, is\n\nlikely   to    be   tortured     either     by       the   government     or     through\n\ngovernmental acquiescence.         We explain briefly.\n\n              In this instance, the petitioner avers that he would be\n\nharmed (i.e., tortured) by gangs upon his return to El Salvador.\n\nWhile he acknowledges that the gangs are not officially sanctioned,\n\nhe asserts that the government is unable to control them.\n\n              Admittedly,    the   record       is    tenebrous      on   this   point.\n\nNevertheless, the BIA concluded, inter alia, that the petitioner\n\nhad failed to establish that the El Salvadoran government would\n\nacquiesce in the gangs' infliction of harm upon private citizens.\n\nThe very murkiness of the record means that we are not compelled to\n\ndecide otherwise, and it therefore makes the BIA's conclusion\n\ninvulnerable.\n\n              At   any   rate,   there    is     evidence     that    gang     violence\n\nconstitutes a serious problem in El Salvador, but that the police\n\nattempt with some success to prevent that activity.3                       While that\n\n\n     2\n      Torture is \"an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment\nand does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading\ntreatment . . . .\"      8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(2). The government\nasseverates that no conduct extreme enough to constitute \"torture\"\nwas in prospect here.    Given our ratio decidendi, we need not\naddress this argument.\n     3\n      Indeed, this evidence is buttressed by the petitioner's\naffidavit, in which he states that it was the intercession of a\nguard that stopped gang members from harassing him in the December\n2001 incident of which he complains.\n\n                                         -10-\n\fsort of stand-off may be of scant solace to the citizenry, it\n\nplainly supports an inference that the government neither condones\n\ngang violence nor is helpless in the face of it.4\n\n                The short of it is that the petitioner has not adduced\n\nany compelling evidence that the putative torturers are state\n\nactors or, alternatively, that the authorities would be in some way\n\ncomplicit (or at least acquiescent) in the infliction of harm.\n\nThis       is   dispositive   because   the    infliction   of   harm   does   not\n\nconstitute torture within the meaning of the CAT unless that harm\n\nis inflicted by, at the direction of, or with the acquiescence of\n\ngovernment officials.          See 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1); Sharari v.\n\nGonzales, 407 F.3d 467, 475-76 (1st Cir. 2005).              Given this gap in\n\nthe proof, the agency's denial of the petitioner's claim for\n\nprotection under the CAT must stand.\n\n                We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe uphold the BIA's rejection of the petitioner's claims.\n\n\n\nThe petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      To be sure, the petitioner did submit some \"country\nconditions\" evidence suggesting that the El Salvadoran government\nhas not been fully able to bring gang violence to heel. But the\npetitioner has fallen short of providing compelling evidence to\nsupport the conclusion that gang violence is either out of control\nor conducted with the government's tacit consent.\n\n                                        -11-\n\f",

In this immigration case, petitioner Onan\n\nFlores-Coreas, a citizen of El Salvador, seeks judicial review of\n\na final decree of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dated\n\nApril 3, 2007.      That decree affirmed a decision of an immigration\n\njudge   (IJ)    declaring    the   petitioner    ineligible    for    asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and/or protection under the United Nations\n\nConvention Against Torture (CAT).          For the reasons that follow, we\n\ndeny the petition.\n\n            The relevant facts are straightforward.         The petitioner,\n\nnow in his late twenties, was born in El Salvador.            After spending\n\nmuch of his childhood there, he lived for a period of time in the\n\nUnited States.      He then repaired to El Salvador.          The events at\n\nissue in this proceeding transpired after he had returned to his\n\nhomeland.\n\n            The IJ credited the petitioner's testimony, so we start\n\nthere. The petitioner testified to a number of negative encounters\n\nwith gang members in El Salvador from and after 1999.                    These\n\nencounters included a robbery and a concomitant assault, at least\n\none attempt to recruit him as a gang member, efforts to extort\n\nmoney, and a variety of threats.        The petitioner attributed these\n\nmaraudings     to   his   active   membership   in   a   liberal     apostolic\n\nChristian church (El Salvador is a largely Catholic country) and to\n\nhis refusal to join a gang.         He also admitted, however, that (i)\n\nthe gangs aspired to recruit individuals who, like himself, owned\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fautomobiles, and (ii) the gangs also aspired to recruit individuals\n\nwho, like himself, had lived in the continental United States\n\n(assuming that such individuals had money).\n\n            The adverse experiences chronicled by the petitioner\n\nspanned a three-year period from 1999 to the end of 2001.                After\n\nthat, he hid in his house but still could not escape the gangs'\n\nunrequited attention.\n\n            The dénouement occurred in 2003.          On one occasion during\n\nthat year, gang members came to the petitioner's home after a\n\ndrinking spree and waited for him to emerge.           They left when others\n\ntold them (falsely) that the petitioner was not there.\n\n            A month later, the petitioner fled.               He entered the\n\nUnited States, without inspection, at or near Columbus, New Mexico,\n\naround November 7, 2003.         He was immediately detained, and the\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings.                In\n\ndue course, the petitioner conceded removability and cross-applied\n\nfor asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.\n\n            Following an evidentiary hearing, the IJ concluded that\n\nthe petitioner's testimony was credible but that he had failed to\n\nestablish    that   he   was   targeted    by   the   gangs   because   of   his\n\nreligious or political beliefs.             In the IJ's view, the gangs\n\nappeared to be harassing the petitioner because of his perceived\n\naffluence.    Thus, the petitioner had not carried the burden of\n\ndemonstrating a nexus between the claimed persecution (the gangs'\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\foffensive    conduct)      and    a    characteristic    protected      under   the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act.\n\n            The    IJ   also     found    that     although   gang    members   had\n\naddressed some threats to the petitioner concerning his refusal to\n\njoin their ranks, these threats were neither \"of an escalating\n\nnature\" nor \"severe.\"       As to the fact that the petitioner had been\n\nphysically assaulted on one occasion, the IJ noted that the assault\n\ntranspired \"in connection with being robbed.\"                 In sum, the series\n\nof incidents that had occurred did not add up to persecution.\n\n            Based on these and other findings, the IJ denied all\n\nthree forms of requested relief.            On appeal, the BIA affirmed the\n\nIJ's decision, stating that the petitioner had \"failed to establish\n\nthat the gangs in El Salvador, who attempted to rob him and extort\n\nmoney from him, were motivated by his political opinion, imputed\n\npolitical opinion, religion, or another protected ground, rather\n\nthan by financial gain.\"          In addition, the BIA observed that the\n\npetitioner had not established that the gangs were working with the\n\ngovernment    or    that    the       government    lacked    power   over   them.\n\nConsequently, the petitioner's generalized fear that he would fall\n\nprey to gang violence should he be returned to El Salvador did not\n\nrender him eligible either for protection under the CAT or for any\n\nother relief.\n\n            Once the BIA ruled that the petitioner had failed to\n\nsatisfy the requirements for asylum, withholding of removal, or\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fprotection under the CAT, the petitioner filed this petition for\n\njudicial    review.        The   petition    is    timely,    see    8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1252(b)(1), and we have jurisdiction to entertain it under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252, as amended.\n\n            We    begin    our   substantive      analysis   by     examining the\n\npetitioner's      asylum   claim.     To    qualify   for    asylum,     an   alien\n\ninitially must establish his status as a refugee, that is, a person\n\nwho is unable or unwilling to return to his homeland \"because of\n\npersecution . . . on account of race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\"                   8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see INS v.

To accomplish this\n\nfeat, the petitioner must \"provide sufficient evidence to forge an\n\nactual connection between the harm and some statutorily protected\n\nground.\"   Lopez de Hincapie, 494 F.3d at 218; see Da Silva v.\n\nAshcroft </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201398\"><a href=\"/opinion/201398/da-silva-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (1st Cir. 2005); see also 8 C.F.R. §\n\n208.13(b)(1).\n\n           The question of whether persecution is on account of one\n\nof the five statutorily protected grounds is factbound.   Hence, we\n\nreview the BIA's answer to that question through the prism of the\n\nsubstantial evidence rule. See Lopez de Hincapie, 494 F.3d at 218.\n\n\"This is a highly deferential standard, under which we must uphold\n\nthe BIA's determination as long as that determination is 'supported\n\nby reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.'\"   Id. (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 481 (1992)).     \"That the record supports a conclusion\n\ncontrary to that reached by the BIA is not enough to warrant\n\nupsetting the BIA's view of the matter; for that to occur, the\n\nrecord must compel the contrary conclusion.\"    Id. (citing Elias-\n\nZacarias, 502 U.S. at 481 n.1)(emphasis in original); see 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(b)(4)(B) (mandating that, in this context, \"administrative\n\nfindings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator\n\nwould be compelled to conclude to the contrary\").\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f          Here, the petitioner tries to connect the gangs' unruly\n\nconduct to his religious persuasion (membership in an apostolic\n\nChristian church) or, alternatively, to his political opinion\n\n(imputed from his refusal to join a gang).          But he weaves these\n\nconnections out of the gossamer strands of speculation and surmise.\n\nIn support, he offers only his personal (subjective) conviction and\n\nweak circumstantial evidence that either or both of these reasons\n\nspurred the gangs' actions. Hard evidence of the required nexus is\n\nconspicuously absent.\n\n          We add, moreover, that what evidence exists in the record\n\ninvites the inference that the gangs targeted the petitioner\n\nbecause of greed, not religion or politics.          That inference is\n\nreinforced by its plausibility: gangs typically are composed of\n\ncommon criminals who are apt to resort to force to accomplish their\n\nnefarious ends.    See Romilus v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201241\"><a href=\"/opinion/201241/romilus-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6-7 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).   Even reading the record with a charitable eye, the gangs'\n\nactions (as the petitioner describes them) could just as easily\n\nhave been prompted by a desire to extort money as by any motive\n\nconnected to a statutorily protected ground. That state of affairs\n\nleaves   us   no   principled   choice   but   to    uphold   the   BIA's\n\ndetermination.1    After all, where the record admits of plausible\n\n\n\n     1\n      Because this ground suffices to sustain the denial of the\nclaim for asylum, we need not consider the BIA's alternative\nholding that the conduct complained of, though harassing, did not\nsink to the level of persecution.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fbut conflicting inferences, the agency's choice between those\n\ninferences is necessarily supported by substantial evidence.                          See\n\nBocova, 412 F.3d at 264; Aguilar-Solis v.

We are not without empathy\n\nfor the petitioner's plight.             Gang violence apparently is endemic\n\nin El Salvador, and the events described by the petitioner paint an\n\nunattractive picture.           But the substantial evidence rule demands\n\nthat we uphold the agency's determination unless the evidence\n\n\"points   unerringly       in     the    opposite     direction.\"           Laurent    v.\n\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200882\"><a href=\"/opinion/200882/laurent-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 64 (1st Cir. 2004).                     The evidence here does\n\nnot   approach    that    level     of    certitude       in    connection     with   the\n\nputative relationship between the gangs' menacing actions and the\n\npetitioner's religious and/or political beliefs.\n\n            We need not linger long over the petitioner's claim for\n\nwithholding      of    removal.         Although    the    tests      for   asylum    and\n\nwithholding      of    removal    differ    somewhat,          the   \"on    account   of\"\n\nrequirement is embedded identically in each formulation.

Accordingly,     the\n\npetitioner's failure to establish a nexus between the conduct\n\ncomplained of and some statutorily protected ground serves equally\n\nto defeat his withholding of removal claim.                      See, e.g., Lopez de\n\nHincapie, 494 F.3d at 220.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f          This leaves the petitioner's CAT claim. Unlike his other\n\ntwo claims, this claim does not embody an \"on account of\" element.\n\nAn alien can prevail on a CAT claim simply by showing that, more\n\nlikely than not, he will be tortured if repatriated.             See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.16(c)(2); see also Ang v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201939\"><a href=\"/opinion/201939/ang-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58 (1st Cir.\n\n2005). He need not establish a nexus between the predicted torture\n\nand some statutorily protected ground.\n\n          We   review   the   BIA's    disposition   of    a   CAT   claim   by\n\napplication of the substantial evidence rule.              See Settenda v.\n\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201166\"><a href=\"/opinion/201166/settenda-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 93 (1st Cir. 2004).      Thus, we must honor the\n\nBIA's resolution of the petitioner's CAT claim unless the evidence\n\ncompels us to reach a different conclusion.          Id.       The petitioner\n\ncannot surmount this hurdle.\n\n          In order to qualify for protection under the CAT, an\n\nalien must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he will\n\nbe tortured if returned to his country of origin.                 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1208.16(c)(2).   For purposes of the CAT, \"[t]orture is defined as\n\nany act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or\n\nmental, is intentionally inflicted on a person . . . by or at the\n\n. . . acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in\n\nan official capacity.\"    Id. § 208.18(a)(1).        Passing the question\n\nof whether the actions of which the petitioner complains can be\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fequated with torture,2 there is nothing in the record that compels\n\nthe conclusion that the petitioner, if remitted to his homeland, is\n\nlikely   to    be   tortured     either     by       the   government     or     through\n\ngovernmental acquiescence.         We explain briefly.\n\n              In this instance, the petitioner avers that he would be\n\nharmed (i.e., tortured) by gangs upon his return to El Salvador.\n\nWhile he acknowledges that the gangs are not officially sanctioned,\n\nhe asserts that the government is unable to control them.\n\n              Admittedly,    the   record       is    tenebrous      on   this   point.\n\nNevertheless, the BIA concluded, inter alia, that the petitioner\n\nhad failed to establish that the El Salvadoran government would\n\nacquiesce in the gangs' infliction of harm upon private citizens.\n\nThe very murkiness of the record means that we are not compelled to\n\ndecide otherwise, and it therefore makes the BIA's conclusion\n\ninvulnerable.\n\n              At   any   rate,   there    is     evidence     that    gang     violence\n\nconstitutes a serious problem in El Salvador, but that the police\n\nattempt with some success to prevent that activity.3                       While that\n\n\n     2\n      Torture is \"an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment\nand does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading\ntreatment . . . .\"      8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(2). The government\nasseverates that no conduct extreme enough to constitute \"torture\"\nwas in prospect here.    Given our ratio decidendi, we need not\naddress this argument.\n     3\n      Indeed, this evidence is buttressed by the petitioner's\naffidavit, in which he states that it was the intercession of a\nguard that stopped gang members from harassing him in the December\n2001 incident of which he complains.\n\n                                         -10-\n\fsort of stand-off may be of scant solace to the citizenry, it\n\nplainly supports an inference that the government neither condones\n\ngang violence nor is helpless in the face of it.4\n\n                The short of it is that the petitioner has not adduced\n\nany compelling evidence that the putative torturers are state\n\nactors or, alternatively, that the authorities would be in some way\n\ncomplicit (or at least acquiescent) in the infliction of harm.\n\nThis       is   dispositive   because   the    infliction   of   harm   does   not\n\nconstitute torture within the meaning of the CAT unless that harm\n\nis inflicted by, at the direction of, or with the acquiescence of\n\ngovernment officials.          See 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1); Sharari v.\n\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201584\"><a href=\"/opinion/201584/sharari-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 475-76 (1st Cir. 2005).              Given this gap in\n\nthe proof, the agency's denial of the petitioner's claim for\n\nprotection under the CAT must stand.\n\n                We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe uphold the BIA's rejection of the petitioner's claims.\n\n\n\nThe petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      To be sure, the petitioner did submit some \"country\nconditions\" evidence suggesting that the El Salvadoran government\nhas not been fully able to bring gang violence to heel. But the\npetitioner has fallen short of providing compelling evidence to\nsupport the conclusion that gang violence is either out of control\nor conducted with the government's tacit consent.\n\n                                        -11-\n\f</pre>",
