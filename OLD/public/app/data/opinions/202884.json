Gary Pratt appeals his conviction\n\nfor being a felon in possession of a handgun under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 922(g)(1) and contests an enhanced sentence imposed under the\n\nArmed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).         He argues\n\nthat his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence\n\nbecause    the   government   failed   to   introduce   into   evidence    a\n\nstipulation as to two elements of his offense.          He also contends\n\nthat he did not qualify for an enhanced sentence under the ACCA\n\nbecause he had not been convicted of three violent felonies.              We\n\naffirm the conviction and sentence.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            We state the facts \"as the jury could have found them,\n\ndrawing all inferences in the light most consistent with the jury\n\nverdict.\" United States v. Milkiewicz, 470 F.3d 390, 392 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).    Immediately following his release from prison, Pratt lived\n\non and off with Melody Isham-Pilotte, who purchased a .357 caliber\n\nGlock semiautomatic pistol at his instruction and filled out the\n\npaperwork as the purchaser.      Pratt then kept the gun with him and\n\nused it on several occasions to fire at signs and beer cans.              At\n\none point, after crashing Isham-Pilotte's car and leaving the scene\n\nof the accident, he called to tell her that he had left the gun in\n\nthe trunk of the car.    Isham-Pilotte was able to retrieve the gun.\n\n            Eventually, Pratt was arrested for failure to appear in\n\ncourt on an unrelated matter, and, after an investigation uncovered\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fthe events described above, he was charged with being a felon in\n\npossession of a firearm. His indictment stated that the government\n\nintended to seek a sentencing enhancement under the ACCA, which\n\nprovides a fifteen-year mandatory minimum term for a defendant with\n\nthree prior violent felonies or serious drug offenses.\n\n          Before trial, the parties filed a stipulation agreeing\n\nthat the handgun had been transported in interstate or foreign\n\ncommerce. The stipulation also identified five previous crimes for\n\nwhich Pratt had been convicted.    With respect to those crimes, the\n\nstipulation stated that \"the jury should be instructed by the Court\n\nthat 'the defendant agrees he was previously convicted of a crime\n\npunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year' without\n\nfurther elaboration or explanation.\"    See infra Section II.A.\n\n          At trial, the prosecution told the jury in its opening\n\nstatement that the gun in question had traveled in interstate\n\ncommerce and that Pratt previously had been convicted of a crime\n\npunishable by imprisonment for more than one year.     However, the\n\nstipulation providing the evidentiary support for this statement\n\nwas never presented to the jury as evidence prior to the close of\n\nevidence, and the prosecution did not introduce other evidence that\n\nthe gun had traveled in interstate commerce or that Pratt was a\n\nconvicted felon.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f          After    the   close   of   evidence,   the   court   issued   its\n\ninstructions to the jury.     It first provided a general instruction\n\non stipulations:\n\n          During the course of trial, you were told that\n          the government and the defendant agreed or\n          stipulated to certain facts.      This simply\n          means that both sides accept those facts to be\n          true.    Because there is no disagreement\n          regarding those facts, there was no need for\n          either side to introduce evidence relating to\n          them. You may accept as true those facts to\n          which the government and the defendant have\n          stipulated.\n\nWith respect to the charged offense, the court instructed the jury\n\nthat, under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), the government must prove that:\n\n(1) the defendant had been convicted of a felony (which it defined\n\nas a \"crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one\n\nyear\"); (2) the defendant possessed a firearm; and (3) the firearm\n\nhad traveled in interstate commerce.        It then explained that Pratt\n\n          has stipulated or agreed that . . . he was\n          convicted   of  an   offense  punishable   by\n          imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\n          Because there is no disagreement regarding\n          that fact, there was no need for the\n          government to introduce any evidence relating\n          to it. As I mentioned earlier, you may accept\n          as true the facts to which the government and\n          the defendant have stipulated or agreed.\n\nThe court also stated that Pratt\n\n          has stipulated that the Glock semi-automatic\n          pistol at issue in this case traveled across\n          the state boundary line at some time after its\n          manufacture.    Because the parties do not\n          disagree as to that fact, there was no need\n          for the government to introduce any evidence\n          relating to it and you may accept as true the\n\n                                      -4-\n\f           fact that the Glock semi-automatic pistol\n           traveled in or affected interstate commerce.\n\nPratt did not object to these instructions.       The jury returned a\n\nguilty verdict.\n\n           During his sentencing hearing, Pratt objected that he did\n\nnot qualify for an enhanced sentence under the ACCA because his\n\nprior offenses did not include three violent felonies.          The court\n\nrejected his objections and imposed the statutory minimum sentence\n\nof fifteen years.    This appeal ensued.\n\n                                   II.\n\nA. Stipulation to Essential Elements\n\n           To establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), the\n\ngovernment must prove three elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1)\n\nthe defendant possessed a firearm; (2) the firearm had traveled in\n\ninterstate commerce; and (3) the defendant had been convicted of a\n\nfelony prior to his possession of the firearm.        Although Pratt did\n\nnot claim at trial that his stipulation relating to the interstate\n\ncommerce   element   and   the   prior   conviction   element    was   not\n\nintroduced into evidence, he now challenges the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence to support his conviction on those elements. We review an\n\nunpreserved challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence only for\n\nplain error, United States v. Peña-Lora, 225 F.3d 17, 26 (1st Cir.\n\n2000), and will reverse only if the conviction would result in a\n\n\"clear and gross injustice,\" United States v. Bello-Perez, 977 F.2d\n\n664, 668 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n                                   -5-\n\f            Technically, the court erred by first presenting the\n\nsubject   matter   of   the   stipulation   to   the   jury   in   its   jury\n\ninstructions, after the close of evidence.             Ordinarily, unless\n\nthere is a contrary agreement between the parties, district courts\n\nshould ensure that a stipulation, or the content thereof, is\n\npresented to the jurors prior to the close of evidence.                  This\n\npresentation may take various forms: the stipulation itself could\n\nbe entered into evidence, the court could read the stipulation into\n\nevidence, or the parties could agree that one of them will publish\n\nthe stipulation to the jury.      The presentation will often include\n\nan explanation by the court that the stipulation means that the\n\ngovernment and the defendant accept the truth of a particular\n\nproposition of fact, and, hence, there is no need for evidence\n\napart from the stipulation itself.\n\n            The concurrence suggests that \"no settled rule exists as\n\nto how the jury is to be informed of a stipulation.\"1              We do not\n\ndisagree.   In fact, we have suggested a variety of ways in which a\n\n\n\n     1\n       The concurrence also states that there is no recurring\nproblem relating to the handling of stipulations.          However,\ndisputes regarding the handling of stipulations have arisen with\nsome frequency in the appellate courts. See, e.g., United States\nv. Harrison, 204 F.3d 236, 238-43 (D.C. Cir. 2000); United States\nv. Meade, 175 F.3d 215, 222-24 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v.\nHardin, 139 F.3d 813, 814-17 (11th Cir. 1998); United States v.\nMelina, 101 F.3d 567, 572-73 (8th Cir. 1996); United States v.\nMuse, 83 F.3d 672, 677-81 (4th Cir. 1996); United States v. Branch,\n46 F.3d 440, 441-42 (5th Cir. 1995); United States v. James, 987\nF.2d 648, 648-52 (9th Cir. 1993); United States v. Clark, 993 F.2d\n402, 405-06 (4th Cir. 1993).\n\n                                   -6-\n\fjury could be informed of the content of a stipulation.           However,\n\nin our view, there is a settled rule that the content of a\n\nstipulation must be published to the jury prior to the close of\n\nevidence.      That settled rule is confirmed by a review of the\n\npattern jury instructions from the circuits.            For example, the\n\nPattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the\n\nFirst Circuit state, with respect to stipulations:\n\n            The evidence in this case includes facts to\n            which the lawyers have agreed or stipulated.\n            A stipulation means simply that the government\n            and the defendant accept the truth of a\n            particular proposition or fact. Since there\n            is no disagreement, there is no need for\n            evidence apart from the stipulation. You must\n            accept the stipulation as fact to be given\n            whatever weight you choose.\n\nPattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the First\n\nCircuit         §     2.01        (1998),          available           at\n\nhttp://www.med.uscourts.gov/practices/crpji.97nov.pdf (last visited July\n\n19, 2007)(emphasis added).2   Other circuits similarly acknowledge the\n\nevidentiary nature of stipulations.     See e.g., Pattern Criminal Jury\n\nInstructions    for    the     Sixth     Circuit    §      1.04     (2007)\n\nhttp://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/crim_jury_insts/pdf/crmpattjur_full\n\n.pdf (last visited July 29, 2007)(“The evidence in this case includes\n\nonly what the witnesses said while they were testifying under oath;\n\nthe exhibits that I allowed into evidence; the stipulations that\n\n\n     2\n       As we have previously noted, the Pattern Criminal Jury\nInstructions are not mandatory in the First Circuit. See United\nStates v. Sabetta, 373 F.3d 75, 82 n.2 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                  -7-\n\fthe lawyers agreed to; and the facts that I have judicially\n\nnoticed.”);    Pattern       Criminal   Jury   Instructions      for   the   Tenth\n\nCircuit            §        1.01        (2005),          available              at\n\nhttp://www.ck10.uscourts.gov/downloads/pji10-cir-crim.pdf                    (last\n\nvisited July 29, 2007)(“Evidence will be presented from which you\n\nwill have to determine the facts.         The evidence will consist of the\n\ntestimony of the witnesses, documents and other things received\n\ninto the record as exhibits, and any facts about which the lawyers\n\nagree    or   to   which     they   stipulate.”);      Pattern   Criminal      Jury\n\nInstructions for the Seventh Circuit § 1.02 (1998), available at\n\nhttp://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/pjury.pdf (last visited July 29, 2007)\n\n(“The evidence consists of the testimony of the witnesses, the\n\nexhibits entered in evidence, and stipulations.”).                     The Fourth\n\nCircuit, in United States v. Muse, 83 F.3d 672, 678 (4th Cir.\n\n1996), reinforced the assumption of these instructions with its\n\nstatement     that     \"a   defendant   waives   the    requirement     that   the\n\ngovernment produce evidence (other than the stipulation itself) to\n\nestablish the facts stipulated to beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\n(Emphasis added.)3\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Muse is not entirely on point because the stipulation to two\nessential elements of the charged offense was read to the jury, and\nthe issue was whether the jury instructions properly conveyed the\nevidentiary force of the stipulation.      Muse, 83 F.3d at 678.\nHowever, the case does reflect the prevalent understanding that a\nstipulation should be introduced into evidence.\n\n                                        -8-\n\f            The handling of Pratt's stipulation did not comply with\n\nthe   standard   practice   surrounding   stipulations     that   we   have\n\ndescribed above,4 and the language of the stipulation offers no\n\nindication that the parties intended to depart from this standard\n\npractice.    In full, the stipulation reads as follows:\n\n            The United States and the defendant stipulate\n            to the following facts, which the parties\n            agree can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt:\n\n            1. That the .375 caliber Glock Semiautomatic\n            Pistol   Serial   #   EWU023US,    which   was\n            manufactured in Austria, had been transported\n            in interstate or foreign commerce, and that it\n            is a \"firearm\" for purposes of 18 U.S.C.\n            § 921(a)(3).\n\n            2. That Mr. Pratt      was    convicted   of   the\n            following crimes:\n\n            A. On September 12, 1986, the defendant was\n            convicted in Hillsborough County Superior\n            Court of Armed Robbery [under N.H. Rev. Stat.\n            Ann. § 636:1].\n\n            B. On January 9, 1995, the defendant was\n            convicted in Hillsborough Superior Court of\n            Accomplice to Armed Robbery [under N.H. Rev.\n            Stat. Ann. §§ 629:1, 636:1].\n\n\n\n      4\n       To the extent that some of the other circuits have held\nthat, by stipulating, a defendant waives his right to have the\ngovernment enter the content of the stipulation into evidence, they\nare at odds with the prevalent understanding of how a stipulation\nshould be handled. See Hardin, 139 F.3d at 816 (\"Hardin waived his\nright to have the government produce evidence of his felon status,\nincluding the stipulation itself.\"); Harrison, 204 F.3d at 242;\n(\"[T]here is little to be gained from holding that a stipulation,\nwhich unarguably waives a defendant's right to require the\ngovernment to produce any evidence regarding that stipulation,\nnevertheless fails to waive the defendant's right to require that\nstipulation to be read to the jury.\").\n\n                                  -9-\n\f          C. On 21, 1988, the defendant was convicted in\n          Merrimack County Superior Court of Assault by\n          a Prisoner [under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n          § 642:9].\n\n          D. On June 15, 1990, the defendant was\n          convicted in Carroll County Superior Court of\n          Burglary [under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 635:1].\n\n          E. On April 5, 1990, the defendant was\n          convicted in Hillsborough County Superior\n          Court of Escape [under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n          § 642:6].\n\n          which   are   all    crimes   punishable    by\n          imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\n\n          The parties further stipulate that the jury\n          should be instructed by the Court that \"the\n          defendant agrees he was previously convicted\n          of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a\n          term exceeding one year\" without further\n          elaboration or explanation.\n\nThis text indicates that the parties contemplated that the judge\n\nwould read the appropriate portions of the stipulation to the jury\n\nat a mutually agreeable time.5\n\n\n     5\n      The brief conversation regarding the stipulation between the\nprosecutor and the court, which took place prior to the swearing in\nof the jury, supports this understanding:\n\n     Prosecutor: Judge, the United States would like to file\n     a stipulation between the parties as to certain elements\n     of the crime. It's been executed by the defendant, his\n     counsel, and the United States.\n\n     The Court: All right, at the appropriate time do you\n     expect me to read it or would you like to read it . . .\n     it's up to you . . . .\n\n     Prosecutor: There's references to the conviction, judge.\n     The very last part of the stipulation is the agreement as\n     to what you should read to them.      I don't think it's\n     necessary to read it to them at this point in the case.\n\n                                 -10-\n\f            Given the agreement that the jury should be told that\n\nPratt had a prior felony conviction \"without further elaboration or\n\nexplanation,\" the parties did not intend for the stipulation itself\n\nto be introduced into evidence. Indeed, part of the motivation for\n\nthe stipulation on the part of the defense was to prevent detailed\n\nevidence of Pratt's criminal history from coming before the jury.\n\nThus, the stipulation reveals an understanding that the judge would\n\npresent the material regarding the interstate commerce element and\n\nthe prior conviction element to the jury as evidence on those\n\nelements,   with   the   further   understanding,   as   the   stipulation\n\nstates, that the facts set forth in the stipulation \"can be proved\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\" We do not interpret the statement that\n\n\"the jury should be instructed\" regarding the prior convictions to\n\nmean that the parties agreed that this information should have been\n\nconveyed during the jury instructions, after the close of evidence,\n\ncontrary to the usual practice.       Instead, \"instructed\" just means\n\nthat the court should explain to the jury at the appropriate time\n\nthat the defendant was previously convicted of a felony.             That\n\nappropriate time would be at some point during the presentation of\n\nevidence to the jury.     However, the judge did not read the agreed-\n\nupon portion of the stipulation to the jury during the presentation\n\nof evidence, conveying the requisite material to the jury only in\n\nthe jury instructions, following the close of evidence.              Jury\n\n\nDefense counsel was silent during this interaction.\n\n                                   -11-\n\finstructions themselves are not evidence, and so, again, this\n\nomission was an error, albeit a technical one.6\n\n          Ultimately,     however,    this   technical   error   does   not\n\nremotely warrant reversal of Pratt’s conviction.           As noted, the\n\nparticularly stringent form of plain error review we apply to an\n\nunpreserved challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence asks\n\nwhether the conviction resulted in a \"clear and gross injustice.\"\n\nBello-Perez, 977 F.2d at 668.        Because Pratt had in fact conceded\n\nthe elements addressed by the stipulation, no such injustice\n\noccurred here.     Consequently, we reject Pratt's claim of plain\n\nerror.\n\nB. Stipulation to Prior Offenses\n\n          Pratt    also    challenges     the   fifteen-year     term    of\n\nimprisonment he received under the ACCA, which mandates such a\n\nsentence for an individual convicted of being a felon in possession\n\nof a firearm who also has \"three previous convictions . . . for a\n\nviolent felony.\"     18 U.S.C. § 924(e).         Pratt claims that the\n\ngovernment failed to establish three such convictions.           Whether a\n\ncrime qualifies as a violent felony is a legal question that we\n\n\n\n     6\n        The concurrence suggests that we have manufactured\nunnecessary law in this opinion. We respectfully disagree. Our\nholding is simply a reminder to the trial courts of some well-\nestablished propositions — namely, that stipulations are evidence,\njury instructions are not, and a stipulation should be presented to\nthe jury, in whatever manner the parties and the courts agree to,\nprior to the close of evidence. We doubt that the trial courts, or\nthe litigants, will feel unduly burdened by these reminders.\n\n                                 -12-\n\freview de novo.      United States v. Mastera, 435 F.3d 56, 59 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n             As noted, before trial, Pratt stipulated to the fact of\n\nhis prior convictions for five offenses under New Hampshire law:\n\n(1) armed robbery; (2) accomplice to armed robbery; (3) assault by\n\na prisoner; (4) burglary; and (5) escape from prison.            See supra\n\nSection II.A.     On appeal, he argues that three of these offenses —\n\naccomplice to armed robbery, burglary, and escape from prison — do\n\nnot fall within the category of \"violent felonies\" for purposes of\n\n§ 924(e).\n\n             Pratt's claim fails in light of our precedents on the\n\ncrime of escape.        In United States v. Winn, 364 F.3d 7, 12 (1st\n\nCir. 2004), we held that a conviction under the New Hampshire\n\nescape statute \"is properly characterized as a crime of violence\n\nfor   the    purposes    of   career    offender   enhancement   under   the\n\nsentencing guidelines.\"        We have also held that \"the definitions\n\nof 'crime of violence' and 'violent felony' are mirror images of\n\neach other and that, therefore, cases construing one such term\n\nshould be considered instructive with respect to the scope of the\n\nother.\" United States v. Richards, 456 F.3d 260, 263 n.2 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).      Our case law thus establishes that the crime of escape is\n\na violent felony.       Pratt stipulated to two other offenses that he\n\ndoes not dispute were violent felonies — armed robbery and assault\n\nby a prisoner.      These three offenses were a sufficient predicate\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\ffor the sentencing enhancement under the ACCA, and we therefore\n\nneed not consider Pratt's arguments with respect to the remaining\n\ntwo stipulated offenses.7\n\n                               III.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Pratt's conviction\n\nand sentence.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n                  - Concurring Opinion Follows -\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       Pratt also asserts that his sentencing was in violation of\nthe Fifth and Sixth Amendments because the indictment did not\ncharge, he did not admit, and a jury did not find that his prior\nconvictions qualified as predicate offenses under the ACCA. The\nSupreme Court rejected this argument in Almendarez-Torres v. United\nStates, 523 U.S. 224, 239 (1998), and Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530\nU.S. 466, 489-90 (2000), but Pratt argues that a majority of the\nSupreme Court is now poised to overrule its prior holding. As he\nacknowledges, however, we have rejected this argument on numerous\noccasions. See, e.g., United States v. McKenney, 450 F.3d 39, 45-\n46 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v. Moore, 286 F.3d 47, 51 (1st\nCir. 2002). Thus, we need not give it further consideration here.\n\n                               -14-\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge, concurring in the judgment. No\n\nsingle ritual has been prescribed for advising the jury that a\n\nfactual issue has been stipulated to by the parties.                  In some cases\n\na written stipulation is introduced; in others, the jury is merely\n\ninformed; and no fixed rule exists as to timing.                     Surely if the\n\nparties are content and the pertinent information is conveyed, this\n\nis a matter that should be left to the informed discretion of the\n\ndistrict judge.\n\n            The parties in this case agreed that the defendant had a\n\nprior   felony    conviction       and   the    gun   had   moved    in   interstate\n\ncommerce.     They signed and filed a stipulation to this effect\n\nlisting the specific felonies.           The government in opening argument\n\ntold the jury as to what had been stipulated, without identifying\n\nthe three specific felonies--an omission helpful to the defendant.\n\nIn the instructions, the judge repeated the substance to the jury.\n\n            The defendant did not object either to the opening\n\nstatement or the court's handling of the matter at the instruction\n\nstage and even on appeal cannot explain how he was disadvantaged by\n\nthe   procedure       followed,    arguing      instead     that    there   was    \"no\n\nevidence\" as to the stipulated facts.                 Of course, the point of a\n\nstipulation      is   to   avoid   the   need    to    present     evidence   of   an\n\nuncontested fact.\n\n            Merely to read the panel opinion is to confirm that no\n\nsettled rule exists as to how the jury is to be informed of a\n\n                                         -15-\n\fstipulation.     And, in the absence of a governing rule or some\n\nprejudicial action, what the district judge did was assuredly not\n\n\"error.\"   Nor is there any indication of any \"standard practice\"--\n\nwhatever this may mean--or that the district judge departed from\n\nwhat the parties intended.\n\n           If a recurring problem were presented as to handling of\n\nstipulations, it might be acceptable to say that--though there was\n\nno error--the matter ought in the future to be handled in a\n\ndifferent way.     But no such problem exists. Manufacturing more\n\nunnecessary \"law,\" of which there is already no shortage, merely\n\ncreates new traps for trial judges and litigants who are trying to\n\nget their jobs done under pressures far exceeding our own.\n\n\n\n\n                                -16-\n\f",

Mizner, Assistant Federal Public Defender, for appellant.</p>\n<p>Terry L. Ollila, with whom Thomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, and Aixa Maldonado-Quiñones, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, Chief Judge, LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, and SHADUR,<sup>[*]</sup> Senior District Judge.</p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Gary Pratt appeals his conviction for being a felon in possession of a handgun under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) and contests an enhanced sentence imposed under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). He argues that his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence because the government failed to introduce into evidence a stipulation as to two elements of his offense. He also contends that he did not qualify for an enhanced sentence under the ACCA because he had not been convicted of three violent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> felonies. We affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We state the facts \"as the jury could have found them, drawing all inferences in the light most consistent with the jury verdict.\" <i>United States v. Milkiewicz,</i> 470 F.3d 390, 392 (1st Cir.2006). Immediately following his release from prison, Pratt lived on and off with Melody Isham-Pilotte, who purchased a .357 caliber Glock semiautomatic pistol at his instruction and filled out the paperwork as the purchaser. Pratt then kept the gun with him and used it on several occasions to fire at signs and beer cans. At one point, after crashing Isham-Pilotte's car and leaving the scene of the accident, he called to tell her that he had left the gun in the trunk of the car. Isham-Pilotte was able to retrieve the gun.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Pratt was arrested for failure to appear in court on an unrelated matter, and, after an investigation uncovered the events described above, he was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm. His indictment stated that the government intended to seek a sentencing enhancement under the ACCA, which provides a fifteen-year mandatory minimum term for a defendant with three prior violent felonies or serious drug offenses.</p>\n<p>Before trial, the parties filed a stipulation agreeing that the handgun had been transported in interstate or foreign commerce. The stipulation also identified five previous crimes for which Pratt had been convicted. With respect to those crimes, the stipulation stated that \"the jury should be instructed by the Court that `the defendant agrees he was previously convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year' without further elaboration or explanation.\" <i>See infra</i> Section II.A.</p>\n<p>At trial, the prosecution told the jury in its opening statement that the gun in question had traveled in interstate commerce and that Pratt previously had been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. However, the stipulation providing the evidentiary support for this statement was never presented to the jury as evidence prior to the close of evidence, and the prosecution did not introduce other evidence that the gun had traveled in interstate commerce or that Pratt was a convicted felon.</p>\n<p>After the close of evidence, the court issued its instructions to the jury. It first provided a general instruction on stipulations:</p>\n<blockquote>During the course of trial, you were told that the government and the defendant agreed or stipulated to certain facts. This simply means that both sides accept those facts to be true. Because there is no disagreement regarding those facts, there was no need for either side to introduce evidence relating to them. You may accept as true those facts to which the government and the defendant have stipulated.</blockquote>\n<p>With respect to the charged offense, the court instructed the jury that, under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), the government must prove that: (1) the defendant had been convicted of a felony (which it defined as a \"crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\"); (2) the defendant possessed a firearm; and (3) the firearm had traveled in interstate commerce. It then explained that Pratt</p>\n<blockquote>has stipulated or agreed that . . . he was convicted of an offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. Because there is no disagreement regarding that fact, there was no need for the government to introduce any evidence relating to it. As I mentioned <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> earlier, you may accept as true the facts to which the government and the defendant have stipulated or agreed.</blockquote>\n<p>The court also stated that Pratt</p>\n<blockquote>has stipulated that the Glock semi-automatic pistol at issue in this case traveled across the state boundary line at some time after its manufacture. Because the parties do not disagree as to that fact, there was no need for the government to introduce any evidence relating to it and you may accept as true the fact that the Glock semi-automatic pistol traveled in or affected interstate commerce.</blockquote>\n<p>Pratt did not object to these instructions. The jury returned a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p>During his sentencing hearing, Pratt objected that he did not qualify for an enhanced sentence under the ACCA because his prior offenses did not include three violent felonies. The court rejected his objections and imposed the statutory minimum sentence of fifteen years. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>A. Stipulation to Essential Elements</p>\n<p>To establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), the government must prove three elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the defendant possessed a firearm; (2) the firearm had traveled in interstate commerce; and (3) the defendant had been convicted of a felony prior to his possession of the firearm. Although Pratt did not claim at trial that his stipulation relating to the interstate commerce element and the prior conviction element was not introduced into evidence, he now challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction on those elements. We review an unpreserved challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence only for plain error, <i>United States v. Peña-Lora,</i> 225 F.3d 17, 26 (1st Cir.2000), and will reverse only if the conviction would result in a \"clear and gross injustice,\" <i>United States v. Bello-Perez,</i> 977 F.2d 664, 668 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p>Technically, the court erred by first presenting the subject matter of the stipulation to the jury in its jury instructions, after the close of evidence. Ordinarily, unless there is a contrary agreement between the parties, district courts should ensure that a stipulation, or the content thereof, is presented to the jurors prior to the close of evidence. This presentation may take various forms: the stipulation itself could be entered into evidence, the court could read the stipulation into evidence, or the parties could agree that one of them will publish the stipulation to the jury. The presentation will often include an explanation by the court that the stipulation means that the government and the defendant accept the truth of a particular proposition of fact, and, hence, there is no need for evidence apart from the stipulation itself.</p>\n<p>The concurrence suggests that \"no settled rule exists as to how the jury is to be informed of a stipulation.\"<sup>[1]</sup> We do not disagree. In fact, we have suggested a variety of ways in which a jury could be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> informed of the content of a stipulation. However, in our view, there is a settled rule that the content of a stipulation must be published to the jury prior to the close of evidence. That settled rule is confirmed by a review of the pattern jury instructions from the circuits. For example, the Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the First Circuit state, with respect to stipulations:</p>\n<blockquote>The evidence in this case includes facts to which the lawyers have agreed or stipulated. A stipulation means simply that the government and the defendant accept the truth of a particular proposition or fact. Since there is no disagreement, there is no need for evidence <i>apart from the stipulation.</i> You must accept the stipulation as fact to be given whatever weight you choose.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the First Circuit</i> § 2.01 (1998), <i>available at http://www.med. uscourts.gov/practices/crpji.97nov.pdf</i> (last visited July 19, 2007)(emphasis added).<sup>[2]</sup> Other circuits similarly acknowledge the evidentiary nature of stipulations. <i>See e.g., Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the Sixth Circuit</i> § 1.04 (2007) <i>http:// www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/crim  jury  insts/pdf/crmpattjur  full.pdf</i> (last visited July 29, 2007)(\"The evidence in this case includes only what the witnesses said while they were testifying under oath; the exhibits that I allowed into evidence; the stipulations that the lawyers agreed to; and the facts that I have judicially noticed.\"); <i>Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the Tenth Circuit</i> § 1.01 (2005), <i>available at http: //www.ck10.uscourts.gov/ downloads/pji10-cir-crim.pdf</i> (last visited July 29, 2007)(\"Evidence will be presented from which you will have to determine the facts. The evidence will consist of the testimony of the witnesses, documents and other things received into the record as exhibits, and any facts about which the lawyers agree or to which they stipulate.\"); <i>Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the Seventh Circuit</i> § 1.02 (1998), <i>available at http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/pjury. pdf</i> (last visited July 29, 2007) (\"The evidence consists of the testimony of the witnesses, the exhibits entered in evidence, and stipulations.\"). The Fourth Circuit, in <i>United States v. Muse,</i> 83 F.3d 672, 678 (4th Cir.1996), reinforced the assumption of these instructions with its statement that \"a defendant waives the requirement that the government produce evidence (<i>other than the stipulation itself</i>) to establish the facts stipulated to beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Emphasis added.)<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The handling of Pratt's stipulation did not comply with the standard practice surrounding stipulations that we have described above,<sup>[4]</sup> and the language of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> stipulation offers no indication that the parties intended to depart from this standard practice. In full, the stipulation reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>The United States and the defendant stipulate to the following facts, which the parties agree can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1. That the .375 caliber Glock Semiautomatic Pistol Serial # EWU023US, which was manufactured in Austria, had been transported in interstate or foreign commerce, and that it is a \"firearm\" for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. That Mr. Pratt was convicted of the following crimes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. On September 12, 1986, the defendant was convicted in Hillsborough County Superior Court of Armed Robbery [under N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 636:1].</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B. On January 9, 1995, the defendant was convicted in Hillsborough Superior Court of Accomplice to Armed Robbery [under N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. §§ 629:1, 636:1].</blockquote>\n<blockquote>C. On 21, 1988, the defendant was convicted in Merrimack County Superior Court of Assault by a Prisoner [under N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 642:9].</blockquote>\n<blockquote>D. On June 15, 1990, the defendant was convicted in Carroll County Superior Court of Burglary [under N.H.Rev. Stat. Ann. § 635:1].</blockquote>\n<blockquote>E. On April 5, 1990, the defendant was convicted in Hillsborough County Superior Court of Escape [under N.H.Rev. Stat. Ann. § 642:6]. which are all crimes punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The parties further stipulate that the jury should be instructed by the Court that \"the defendant agrees he was previously convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" without further elaboration or explanation.</blockquote>\n<p>This text indicates that the parties contemplated that the judge would read the appropriate portions of the stipulation to the jury at a mutually agreeable time.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Given the agreement that the jury should be told that Pratt had a prior felony conviction \"without further elaboration or explanation,\" the parties did not intend for the stipulation itself to be introduced into evidence. Indeed, part of the motivation for the stipulation on the part of the defense was to prevent detailed evidence of Pratt's criminal history from coming before the jury. Thus, the stipulation reveals an understanding that the judge would present the material regarding the interstate commerce element and the prior conviction element to the jury as evidence on those elements, with the further understanding, as the stipulation states, that the facts set forth in the stipulation \"can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" We do not interpret the statement that \"the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> jury should be instructed\" regarding the prior convictions to mean that the parties agreed that this information should have been conveyed during the jury instructions, <i>after</i> the close of evidence, contrary to the usual practice. Instead, \"instructed\" just means that the court should explain to the jury at the appropriate time that the defendant was previously convicted of a felony. That appropriate time would be at some point during the presentation of evidence to the jury. However, the judge did not read the agreed-upon portion of the stipulation to the jury during the presentation of evidence, conveying the requisite material to the jury only in the jury instructions, following the close of evidence. Jury instructions themselves are not evidence, and so, again, this omission was an error, albeit a technical one.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Ultimately, however, this technical error does not remotely warrant reversal of Pratt's conviction. As noted, the particularly stringent form of plain error review we apply to an unpreserved challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence asks whether the conviction resulted in a \"clear and gross injustice.\" <i>Bello-Perez,</i> 977 F.2d at 668. Because Pratt had in fact conceded the elements addressed by the stipulation, no such injustice occurred here. Consequently, we reject Pratt's claim of plain error.</p>\n<p>B. Stipulation to Prior Offenses</p>\n<p>Pratt also challenges the fifteen-year term of imprisonment he received under the ACCA, which mandates such a sentence for an individual convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm who also has \"three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). Pratt claims that the government failed to establish three such convictions. Whether a crime qualifies as a violent felony is a legal question that we review de novo. <i>United States v. Mastera,</i> 435 F.3d 56, 59 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>As noted, before trial, Pratt stipulated to the fact of his prior convictions for five offenses under New Hampshire law: (1) armed robbery; (2) accomplice to armed robbery; (3) assault by a prisoner; (4) burglary; and (5) escape from prison. <i>See supra</i> Section II.A. On appeal, he argues that three of these offenses  accomplice to armed robbery, burglary, and escape from prison  do not fall within the category of \"violent felonies\" for purposes of § 924(e).</p>\n<p>Pratt's claim fails in light of our precedents on the crime of escape. In <i>United States v. Winn,</i> 364 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 2004), we held that a conviction under the New Hampshire escape statute \"is properly characterized as a crime of violence for the purposes of career offender enhancement under the sentencing guidelines.\" We have also held that \"the definitions of `crime of violence' and `violent felony' are mirror images of each other and that, therefore, cases construing one such term should be considered instructive with respect to the scope of the other.\" <i>United States v. Richards,</i> 456 F.3d 260, 263 n. 2 (1st Cir.2006). Our case law thus establishes that the crime of escape is a violent felony. Pratt stipulated to two other offenses that he does not dispute were violent felonies  armed robbery and assault by a prisoner. These three offenses were a sufficient predicate for the sentencing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*131</span> enhancement under the ACCA, and we therefore need not consider Pratt's arguments with respect to the remaining two stipulated offenses.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> Pratt's conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Chief Judge, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>No single ritual has been prescribed for advising the jury that a factual issue has been stipulated to by the parties. In some cases a written stipulation is introduced; in others, the jury is merely informed; and no fixed rule exists as to timing. Surely if the parties are content and the pertinent information is conveyed, this is a matter that should be left to the informed discretion of the district judge.</p>\n<p>The parties in this case agreed that the defendant had a prior felony conviction and the gun had moved in interstate commerce. They signed and filed a stipulation to this effect listing the specific felonies. The government in opening argument told the jury as to what had been stipulated, without identifying the three specific feloniesan omission helpful to the defendant. In the instructions, the judge repeated the substance to the jury.</p>\n<p>The defendant did not object either to the opening statement or the court's handling of the matter at the instruction stage and even on appeal cannot explain how he was disadvantaged by the procedure followed, arguing instead that there was \"no evidence\" as to the stipulated facts. Of course, the point of a stipulation is to avoid the need to present evidence of an uncontested fact.</p>\n<p>Merely to read the panel opinion is to confirm that no settled rule exists as to how the jury is to be informed of a stipulation. And, in the absence of a governing rule or some prejudicial action, what the district judge did was assuredly not \"error.\" Nor is there any indication of any \"standard practice\"whatever this may meanor that the district judge departed from what the parties intended.</p>\n<p>If a recurring problem were presented as to handling of stipulations, it might be acceptable to say thatthough there was no errorthe matter ought in the future to be handled in a different way. But no such problem exists. Manufacturing more unnecessary \"law,\" of which there is already no shortage, merely creates new traps for trial judges and litigants who are trying to get their jobs done under pressures far exceeding our own.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The concurrence also states that there is no recurring problem relating to the handling of stipulations. However, disputes regarding the handling of stipulations have arisen with some frequency in the appellate courts. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Harrison,</i> 204 F.3d 236, 238-43 (D.C.Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Meade,</i> 175 F.3d 215, 222-24 (1st Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Hardin,</i> 139 F.3d 813, 814-17 (11th Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Melina,</i> 101 F.3d 567, 572-73 (8th Cir.1996); <i>United States v. Muse,</i> 83 F.3d 672, 677-81 (4th Cir. 1996); <i>United States v. Branch,</i> 46 F.3d 440, 441-42 (5th Cir.1995); <i>United States v. James,</i> 987 F.2d 648, 648-52 (9th Cir.1993); <i>United States v. Clark,</i> 993 F.2d 402, 405-06 (4th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p>[2]  As we have previously noted, the Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions are not mandatory in the First Circuit. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Sabetta,</i> 373 F.3d 75, 82 n. 2 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>[3]  <i>Muse</i> is not entirely on point because the stipulation to two essential elements of the charged offense <i>was</i> read to the jury, and the issue was whether the jury instructions properly conveyed the evidentiary force of the stipulation. <i>Muse,</i> 83 F.3d at 678. However, the case does reflect the prevalent understanding that a stipulation should be introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p>[4]  To the extent that some of the other circuits have held that, by stipulating, a defendant waives his right to have the government enter the content of the stipulation into evidence, they are at odds with the prevalent understanding of how a stipulation should be handled. <i>See </i><i>Hardin,</i> 139 F.3d at 816 (\"Hardin waived his right to have the government produce evidence of his felon status, including the stipulation itself.\"); <i>Harrison,</i> 204 F.3d at 242; (\"[T]here is little to be gained from holding that a stipulation, which unarguably waives a defendant's right to require the government to produce any evidence regarding that stipulation, nevertheless fails to waive the defendant's right to require that stipulation to be read to the jury.\").</p>\n<p>[5]  The brief conversation regarding the stipulation between the prosecutor and the court, which took place prior to the swearing in of the jury, supports this understanding:\n</p>\n<p>Prosecutor: Judge, the United States would like to file a stipulation between the parties as to certain elements of the crime. It's been executed by the defendant, his counsel, and the United States.</p>\n<p>The Court: All right, at the appropriate time do you expect me to read it or would you like to read it . . . it's up to you. . . .</p>\n<p>Prosecutor: There's references to the conviction, judge. The very last part of the stipulation is the agreement as to what you should read to them. I don't think it's necessary to read it to them at this point in the case.</p>\n<p>Defense counsel was silent during this interaction.</p>\n<p>[6]  The concurrence suggests that we have manufactured unnecessary law in this opinion. We respectfully disagree. Our holding is simply a reminder to the trial courts of some well-established propositions  namely, that stipulations are evidence, jury instructions are not, and a stipulation should be presented to the jury, in whatever manner the parties and the courts agree to, prior to the close of evidence. We doubt that the trial courts, or the litigants, will feel unduly burdened by these reminders.</p>\n<p>[7]  Pratt also asserts that his sentencing was in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments because the indictment did not charge, he did not admit, and a jury did not find that his prior convictions qualified as predicate offenses under the ACCA. The Supreme Court rejected this argument in <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 239, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and <i>Apprendi v.

As he acknowledges, however, we have rejected this argument on numerous occasions. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. McKenney,</i> 450 F.3d 39, 45-46 (1st Cir.2006); <i>United States v.

He argues that his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence because the government failed to introduce into evidence a stipulation as to two elements of his offense. He also contends that he did not qualify for an enhanced sentence under the ACCA because he had not been convicted of three violent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> felonies. We affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We state the facts \"as the jury could have found them, drawing all inferences in the light most consistent with the jury verdict.\" <i>United States v. Milkiewicz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202533\"><a href=\"/opinion/202533/united-states-v-milkiewicz/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span>, 392 (1st Cir.2006). Immediately following his release from prison, Pratt lived on and off with Melody Isham-Pilotte, who purchased a .357 caliber Glock semiautomatic pistol at his instruction and filled out the paperwork as the purchaser. Pratt then kept the gun with him and used it on several occasions to fire at signs and beer cans. At one point, after crashing Isham-Pilotte's car and leaving the scene of the accident, he called to tell her that he had left the gun in the trunk of the car. Isham-Pilotte was able to retrieve the gun.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Pratt was arrested for failure to appear in court on an unrelated matter, and, after an investigation uncovered the events described above, he was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm. His indictment stated that the government intended to seek a sentencing enhancement under the ACCA, which provides a fifteen-year mandatory minimum term for a defendant with three prior violent felonies or serious drug offenses.</p>\n<p>Before trial, the parties filed a stipulation agreeing that the handgun had been transported in interstate or foreign commerce. The stipulation also identified five previous crimes for which Pratt had been convicted. With respect to those crimes, the stipulation stated that \"the jury should be instructed by the Court that `the defendant agrees he was previously convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year' without further elaboration or explanation.\" <i>See infra</i> Section II.A.</p>\n<p>At trial, the prosecution told the jury in its opening statement that the gun in question had traveled in interstate commerce and that Pratt previously had been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. However, the stipulation providing the evidentiary support for this statement was never presented to the jury as evidence prior to the close of evidence, and the prosecution did not introduce other evidence that the gun had traveled in interstate commerce or that Pratt was a convicted felon.</p>\n<p>After the close of evidence, the court issued its instructions to the jury. It first provided a general instruction on stipulations:</p>\n<blockquote>During the course of trial, you were told that the government and the defendant agreed or stipulated to certain facts. This simply means that both sides accept those facts to be true. Because there is no disagreement regarding those facts, there was no need for either side to introduce evidence relating to them. You may accept as true those facts to which the government and the defendant have stipulated.</blockquote>\n<p>With respect to the charged offense, the court instructed the jury that, under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), the government must prove that: (1) the defendant had been convicted of a felony (which it defined as a \"crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\"); (2) the defendant possessed a firearm; and (3) the firearm had traveled in interstate commerce. It then explained that Pratt</p>\n<blockquote>has stipulated or agreed that . . . he was convicted of an offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. Because there is no disagreement regarding that fact, there was no need for the government to introduce any evidence relating to it. As I mentioned <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> earlier, you may accept as true the facts to which the government and the defendant have stipulated or agreed.</blockquote>\n<p>The court also stated that Pratt</p>\n<blockquote>has stipulated that the Glock semi-automatic pistol at issue in this case traveled across the state boundary line at some time after its manufacture. Because the parties do not disagree as to that fact, there was no need for the government to introduce any evidence relating to it and you may accept as true the fact that the Glock semi-automatic pistol traveled in or affected interstate commerce.</blockquote>\n<p>Pratt did not object to these instructions. The jury returned a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p>During his sentencing hearing, Pratt objected that he did not qualify for an enhanced sentence under the ACCA because his prior offenses did not include three violent felonies. The court rejected his objections and imposed the statutory minimum sentence of fifteen years. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>A. Stipulation to Essential Elements</p>\n<p>To establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), the government must prove three elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the defendant possessed a firearm; (2) the firearm had traveled in interstate commerce; and (3) the defendant had been convicted of a felony prior to his possession of the firearm. Although Pratt did not claim at trial that his stipulation relating to the interstate commerce element and the prior conviction element was not introduced into evidence, he now challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction on those elements. We review an unpreserved challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence only for plain error, <i>United States v. Peña-Lora,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770240\"><a href=\"/opinion/770240/united-states-v-luis-manuel-pea-lora-united-states-of-america-v-jorge/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2000), and will reverse only if the conviction would result in a \"clear and gross injustice,\" <i>United States v. Bello-Perez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593168\"><a href=\"/opinion/593168/united-states-v-andres-gabriel-bello-perez-aka-garby/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span>, 668 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p>Technically, the court erred by first presenting the subject matter of the stipulation to the jury in its jury instructions, after the close of evidence. Ordinarily, unless there is a contrary agreement between the parties, district courts should ensure that a stipulation, or the content thereof, is presented to the jurors prior to the close of evidence. This presentation may take various forms: the stipulation itself could be entered into evidence, the court could read the stipulation into evidence, or the parties could agree that one of them will publish the stipulation to the jury. The presentation will often include an explanation by the court that the stipulation means that the government and the defendant accept the truth of a particular proposition of fact, and, hence, there is no need for evidence apart from the stipulation itself.</p>\n<p>The concurrence suggests that \"no settled rule exists as to how the jury is to be informed of a stipulation.\"<sup>[1]</sup> We do not disagree. In fact, we have suggested a variety of ways in which a jury could be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> informed of the content of a stipulation. However, in our view, there is a settled rule that the content of a stipulation must be published to the jury prior to the close of evidence. That settled rule is confirmed by a review of the pattern jury instructions from the circuits. For example, the Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the First Circuit state, with respect to stipulations:</p>\n<blockquote>The evidence in this case includes facts to which the lawyers have agreed or stipulated. A stipulation means simply that the government and the defendant accept the truth of a particular proposition or fact. Since there is no disagreement, there is no need for evidence <i>apart from the stipulation.</i> You must accept the stipulation as fact to be given whatever weight you choose.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the First Circuit</i> § 2.01 (1998), <i>available at http://www.med. uscourts.gov/practices/crpji.97nov.pdf</i> (last visited July 19, 2007)(emphasis added).<sup>[2]</sup> Other circuits similarly acknowledge the evidentiary nature of stipulations. <i>See e.g., Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the Sixth Circuit</i> § 1.04 (2007) <i>http:// www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/crim  jury  insts/pdf/crmpattjur  full.pdf</i> (last visited July 29, 2007)(\"The evidence in this case includes only what the witnesses said while they were testifying under oath; the exhibits that I allowed into evidence; the stipulations that the lawyers agreed to; and the facts that I have judicially noticed.\"); <i>Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the Tenth Circuit</i> § 1.01 (2005), <i>available at http: //www.ck10.uscourts.gov/ downloads/pji10-cir-crim.pdf</i> (last visited July 29, 2007)(\"Evidence will be presented from which you will have to determine the facts. The evidence will consist of the testimony of the witnesses, documents and other things received into the record as exhibits, and any facts about which the lawyers agree or to which they stipulate.\"); <i>Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the Seventh Circuit</i> § 1.02 (1998), <i>available at http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/pjury. pdf</i> (last visited July 29, 2007) (\"The evidence consists of the testimony of the witnesses, the exhibits entered in evidence, and stipulations.\"). The Fourth Circuit, in <i>United States v. Muse,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718207\"><a href=\"/opinion/718207/united-states-v-randall-dwayne-muse/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span>, 678 (4th Cir.1996), reinforced the assumption of these instructions with its statement that \"a defendant waives the requirement that the government produce evidence (<i>other than the stipulation itself</i>) to establish the facts stipulated to beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Emphasis added.)<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The handling of Pratt's stipulation did not comply with the standard practice surrounding stipulations that we have described above,<sup>[4]</sup> and the language of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> stipulation offers no indication that the parties intended to depart from this standard practice. In full, the stipulation reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>The United States and the defendant stipulate to the following facts, which the parties agree can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1. That the .375 caliber Glock Semiautomatic Pistol Serial # EWU023US, which was manufactured in Austria, had been transported in interstate or foreign commerce, and that it is a \"firearm\" for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. That Mr. Pratt was convicted of the following crimes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. On September 12, 1986, the defendant was convicted in Hillsborough County Superior Court of Armed Robbery [under N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 636:1].</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B. On January 9, 1995, the defendant was convicted in Hillsborough Superior Court of Accomplice to Armed Robbery [under N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. §§ 629:1, 636:1].</blockquote>\n<blockquote>C. On 21, 1988, the defendant was convicted in Merrimack County Superior Court of Assault by a Prisoner [under N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 642:9].</blockquote>\n<blockquote>D. On June 15, 1990, the defendant was convicted in Carroll County Superior Court of Burglary [under N.H.Rev. Stat. Ann. § 635:1].</blockquote>\n<blockquote>E. On April 5, 1990, the defendant was convicted in Hillsborough County Superior Court of Escape [under N.H.Rev. Stat. Ann. § 642:6]. which are all crimes punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The parties further stipulate that the jury should be instructed by the Court that \"the defendant agrees he was previously convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" without further elaboration or explanation.</blockquote>\n<p>This text indicates that the parties contemplated that the judge would read the appropriate portions of the stipulation to the jury at a mutually agreeable time.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Given the agreement that the jury should be told that Pratt had a prior felony conviction \"without further elaboration or explanation,\" the parties did not intend for the stipulation itself to be introduced into evidence. Indeed, part of the motivation for the stipulation on the part of the defense was to prevent detailed evidence of Pratt's criminal history from coming before the jury. Thus, the stipulation reveals an understanding that the judge would present the material regarding the interstate commerce element and the prior conviction element to the jury as evidence on those elements, with the further understanding, as the stipulation states, that the facts set forth in the stipulation \"can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" We do not interpret the statement that \"the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> jury should be instructed\" regarding the prior convictions to mean that the parties agreed that this information should have been conveyed during the jury instructions, <i>after</i> the close of evidence, contrary to the usual practice. Instead, \"instructed\" just means that the court should explain to the jury at the appropriate time that the defendant was previously convicted of a felony. That appropriate time would be at some point during the presentation of evidence to the jury. However, the judge did not read the agreed-upon portion of the stipulation to the jury during the presentation of evidence, conveying the requisite material to the jury only in the jury instructions, following the close of evidence. Jury instructions themselves are not evidence, and so, again, this omission was an error, albeit a technical one.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Ultimately, however, this technical error does not remotely warrant reversal of Pratt's conviction. As noted, the particularly stringent form of plain error review we apply to an unpreserved challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence asks whether the conviction resulted in a \"clear and gross injustice.\" <i>Bello-Perez,</i> 977 F.2d at 668. Because Pratt had in fact conceded the elements addressed by the stipulation, no such injustice occurred here. Consequently, we reject Pratt's claim of plain error.</p>\n<p>B. Stipulation to Prior Offenses</p>\n<p>Pratt also challenges the fifteen-year term of imprisonment he received under the ACCA, which mandates such a sentence for an individual convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm who also has \"three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). Pratt claims that the government failed to establish three such convictions. Whether a crime qualifies as a violent felony is a legal question that we review de novo. <i>United States v. Mastera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202030\"><a href=\"/opinion/202030/united-states-v-mastera/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 59 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>As noted, before trial, Pratt stipulated to the fact of his prior convictions for five offenses under New Hampshire law: (1) armed robbery; (2) accomplice to armed robbery; (3) assault by a prisoner; (4) burglary; and (5) escape from prison. <i>See supra</i> Section II.A. On appeal, he argues that three of these offenses  accomplice to armed robbery, burglary, and escape from prison  do not fall within the category of \"violent felonies\" for purposes of § 924(e).</p>\n<p>Pratt's claim fails in light of our precedents on the crime of escape. In <i>United States v. Winn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200958\"><a href=\"/opinion/200958/united-states-v-winn/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir. 2004), we held that a conviction under the New Hampshire escape statute \"is properly characterized as a crime of violence for the purposes of career offender enhancement under the sentencing guidelines.\" We have also held that \"the definitions of `crime of violence' and `violent felony' are mirror images of each other and that, therefore, cases construing one such term should be considered instructive with respect to the scope of the other.\" <i>United States v. Richards,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795168\"><a href=\"/opinion/795168/united-states-v-arnold-richards-iii/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></a></span>, 263 n. 2 (1st Cir.2006). Our case law thus establishes that the crime of escape is a violent felony. Pratt stipulated to two other offenses that he does not dispute were violent felonies  armed robbery and assault by a prisoner. These three offenses were a sufficient predicate for the sentencing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*131</span> enhancement under the ACCA, and we therefore need not consider Pratt's arguments with respect to the remaining two stipulated offenses.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> Pratt's conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Chief Judge, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>No single ritual has been prescribed for advising the jury that a factual issue has been stipulated to by the parties. In some cases a written stipulation is introduced; in others, the jury is merely informed; and no fixed rule exists as to timing. Surely if the parties are content and the pertinent information is conveyed, this is a matter that should be left to the informed discretion of the district judge.</p>\n<p>The parties in this case agreed that the defendant had a prior felony conviction and the gun had moved in interstate commerce. They signed and filed a stipulation to this effect listing the specific felonies. The government in opening argument told the jury as to what had been stipulated, without identifying the three specific feloniesan omission helpful to the defendant. In the instructions, the judge repeated the substance to the jury.</p>\n<p>The defendant did not object either to the opening statement or the court's handling of the matter at the instruction stage and even on appeal cannot explain how he was disadvantaged by the procedure followed, arguing instead that there was \"no evidence\" as to the stipulated facts. Of course, the point of a stipulation is to avoid the need to present evidence of an uncontested fact.</p>\n<p>Merely to read the panel opinion is to confirm that no settled rule exists as to how the jury is to be informed of a stipulation. And, in the absence of a governing rule or some prejudicial action, what the district judge did was assuredly not \"error.\" Nor is there any indication of any \"standard practice\"whatever this may meanor that the district judge departed from what the parties intended.</p>\n<p>If a recurring problem were presented as to handling of stipulations, it might be acceptable to say thatthough there was no errorthe matter ought in the future to be handled in a different way. But no such problem exists. Manufacturing more unnecessary \"law,\" of which there is already no shortage, merely creates new traps for trial judges and litigants who are trying to get their jobs done under pressures far exceeding our own.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The concurrence also states that there is no recurring problem relating to the handling of stipulations.

However, the case does reflect the prevalent understanding that a stipulation should be introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p>[4]  To the extent that some of the other circuits have held that, by stipulating, a defendant waives his right to have the government enter the content of the stipulation into evidence, they are at odds with the prevalent understanding of how a stipulation should be handled. <i>See </i><i>Hardin,</i> 139 F.3d at 816 (\"Hardin waived his right to have the government produce evidence of his felon status, including the stipulation itself.\"); <i>Harrison,</i> 204 F.3d at 242; (\"[T]here is little to be gained from holding that a stipulation, which unarguably waives a defendant's right to require the government to produce any evidence regarding that stipulation, nevertheless fails to waive the defendant's right to require that stipulation to be read to the jury.\").</p>\n<p>[5]  The brief conversation regarding the stipulation between the prosecutor and the court, which took place prior to the swearing in of the jury, supports this understanding:\n</p>\n<p>Prosecutor: Judge, the United States would like to file a stipulation between the parties as to certain elements of the crime. It's been executed by the defendant, his counsel, and the United States.</p>\n<p>The Court: All right, at the appropriate time do you expect me to read it or would you like to read it . . . it's up to you. . . .</p>\n<p>Prosecutor: There's references to the conviction, judge. The very last part of the stipulation is the agreement as to what you should read to them. I don't think it's necessary to read it to them at this point in the case.</p>\n<p>Defense counsel was silent during this interaction.</p>\n<p>[6]  The concurrence suggests that we have manufactured unnecessary law in this opinion. We respectfully disagree. Our holding is simply a reminder to the trial courts of some well-established propositions  namely, that stipulations are evidence, jury instructions are not, and a stipulation should be presented to the jury, in whatever manner the parties and the courts agree to, prior to the close of evidence. We doubt that the trial courts, or the litigants, will feel unduly burdened by these reminders.</p>\n<p>[7]  Pratt also asserts that his sentencing was in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments because the indictment did not charge, he did not admit, and a jury did not find that his prior convictions qualified as predicate offenses under the ACCA.
