Loranger with whom Nichols, Webb & Loranger was\non brief for appellant.\n          Mark Diana with whom Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak &\nStewart, P.C., Peter Bennett and The Bennett Law Firm, P.A. were\non brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                             October 21, 2005\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the    Northern       District      of     California,      sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f               Schwarzer,       Senior    District    Judge.      Plaintiff     Angela\n\nStinson       appeals    from    the     judgment    dismissing    her    action   for\n\nretaliation in violation of the Maine Human Rights Act (“MHRA”).\n\nThe District Court, having granted leave to amend Stinson’s initial\n\ncomplaint, granted defendant SimplexGrinnell’s Federal Rule of\n\nCivil       Procedure    Rule    12(b)(6)    motion    to   dismiss      the   amended\n\ncomplaint, holding that Stinson had failed to state a claim.                       For\n\nthe reasons stated, we affirm.1\n\n                        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n               Stinson’s initial complaint stated that she was employed\n\nby SimplexGrinnell as a service sales representative.                    She alleged\n\nthat on April 9, 2003, she sent an email to her district manager\n\n\n\n        1\n       We note certain facial deficiencies in Stinson’s pleadings\nregarding diversity jurisdiction. First, Stinson failed to allege\nan amount in controversy in excess of the requisite jurisdictional\namount under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a). Second, Stinson alleged that she\nis a resident of Maine, rather than a citizen, as required by\n28 U.S.C. § 1332(a).      Finally, she sued SimplexGrinnell as a\nlimited partnership but failed to allege that none of the members\nof the partnership are citizens of Maine. While subject matter\njurisdiction deficiencies cannot be waived by the parties, the\ncourt may hold the parties to any admissions of jurisdictional\nfacts made in the course of litigation. SimplexGrinell concedes in\nits brief that the amount in controversy at the time of\ncommencement exceeds $75,000 and that Stinson is a citizen of\nMaine.    Moreover, it describes itself as a Delaware limited\npartnership.    Although that does not completely satisfy the\ntechnical requirements applicable to jurisdiction over a limited\npartnership, the parties have given no indication of the existence\nof a limited partner with Maine citizenship. We therefore amend\nStinson’s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1653. See Odishelidze\nv. Aetna Life & Cas. Co., 853 F.2d 21, 24-25 (1st Cir. 1988); see\nalso Snell v. Cleveland, Inc., 316 F.3d 822, 828 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fcomplaining about the unprofessional conduct of her supervisor,\n\nJoseph Correia (“Correia”). In this email, Stinson complained that\n\nCorreia took favorable accounts away from her, that he spoke to her\n\nin an unfavorable tone, and that he screamed at the staff.               She\n\nalleges that she received a written warning in response to her\n\nemail, and that Correia screamed and swore at her in a subsequent\n\nmeeting.      Following an investigation of her email, SimplexGrinnell\n\nterminated her, finding that employees were intimidated and afraid\n\nof her.\n\n              Stinson   filed   a   complaint   against    SimplexGrinnell,\n\nalleging that she was fired for complaining about a hostile work\n\nenvironment and arguing that such retaliatory action was illegal\n\nunder   the    MHRA.     SimplexGrinnell    moved   to    dismiss   Stinson’s\n\ncomplaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).                  In\n\nopposing SimplexGrinnell’s motion, Stinson requested permission to\n\namend her complaint, which the District Court granted.              In doing\n\nso, however, the court stated:        “Maine’s Human Rights Act does not\n\nprotect employees from (or forbid retaliation based on opposition\n\nto) all hostile work environments, only those where the hostility\n\nproceeds from one of the prohibited characteristics (such as sex)\n\n. . . . I will wait to see if the plaintiff, consistent with\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), alleges activity that states\n\na claim.”\n\n              Stinson then filed her amended complaint, which contained\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthe following factual allegations:\n\n     14.   Prior to the above incident, Correia frequently\n     screamed and cursed at the Plaintiff. He did not treat\n     similar male employees in a similar manner.\n\n     15. Because of Correia’s abuse and creation of a hostile\n     environment, in November of 2003, Plaintiff called\n     Defendant’s employee Concern Line to complain about\n     Correia. During the phone call, Plaintiff specifically\n     complained   Correia   had   created   a   hostile   work\n     environment. Plaintiff [sic] complaint to Defendant of\n     the hostile work environment was made in good faith\n     belief that he had created a hostile environment based on\n     her sex and she communicated her complaint to Defendant\n     in good faith.\n\n     . . .\n\n     21. When speaking to Plaintiff, Correia would frequently\n     raise his voice or yell at her. He did not treat male\n     workers in a similar manner.\n\nThe amended complaint then stated her claim under the MHRA in the\n\nfollowing terms:\n\n     32. In November of 2003, Plaintiff complained in good\n     faith to Defendant that her supervisor, Joseph Correia,\n     was subjecting her to a hostile work environment.\n     Plaintiff communicated the complaint to Defendant in good\n     faith and truly believed that she had been the victim of\n     a hostile environment.\n\n             The   District   Court   concluded     that    though   Stinson’s\n\namended   complaint      contained     references      to    alleged    sexual\n\nharassment,    she   failed   to   allege    that   she    complained   to   her\n\nemployer about a sexually hostile environment and thus “still\n\nfail[ed] to allege activity that states a claim for retaliation\n\nunder the Main Human Rights Act.”           The court considered Stinson’s\n\ncareful phrasing of the amended complaint as intentional, given its\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fprior   reference    to    the    strictures      of    Federal   Rule     of   Civil\n\nProcedure 11, and because Stinson had ample opportunity to cure the\n\ndeficiency    in   her    pleading,   the    court       dismissed    the   action.\n\nStinson now appeals the court’s judgment.\n\n                                   DISCUSSION\n\n           “This court applies a de novo standard of review to a\n\ndistrict court’s allowance of a motion to dismiss.” Martin v.\n\nApplied Cellular Tech., Inc., 284 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(citing TAG/ICIB Servs., Inc. v. Pan Am. Grain Co., 215 F.3d 172,\n\n175 (1st Cir. 2000)).       We accept as true “the well-pleaded factual\n\nallegations   of    the    complaint,      draw   all    reasonable       inferences\n\ntherefrom in the plaintiff’s favor and determine whether the\n\ncomplaint, so read, sets forth facts sufficient to justify recovery\n\non any cognizable theory.”         Martin, 284 F.3d at 6.            However, when\n\nit appears certain that the plaintiff would not be entitled to\n\nrelief even when allegations are viewed in the light most favorable\n\nto her, dismissal is appropriate.              See In re Colonial Mortgage\n\nBankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2003) (affirming the\n\nallowance of a motion to dismiss when “the plaintiff’s factual\n\naverments hold out no hope of recovery on any theory adumbrated in\n\nits complaint”).\n\n           To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the\n\nMHRA,   Stinson    “must   show    that:    (1)    she    engaged    in   protected\n\nactivity; (2) her employer thereafter subjected her to adverse\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\femployment action; and (3) a causal link existed between the two\n\nevents.”    Bowen v. Dep’t of Human Serv., 606 A.2d 1051, 1054 (Me.\n\n1992); see Bishop v. Bell Atl. Corp., 299 F.3d 53, 58 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).2     Specifically, to satisfy the third prong of this prima\n\nfacie test, Stinson “must present sufficient evidence to raise an\n\ninference that her protected activity was the likely reason for the\n\nadverse action and must show that her employer was aware that she\n\nwas engaged in the protected activity.”               Bowen, 606 A.2d at 1054\n\n(emphasis added); see also King v. Town of Hanover, 116 F.3d 965,\n\n968 (1st Cir. 1997); Oakstone v. Postmaster Gen., 332 F. Supp. 2d\n\n261, 268 (D. Me. 2004). Courts have consistently held the failure\n\nto   make   a   showing    of   causation   to   be    a   fatal   defect   in   a\n\nretaliation claim.        See Star v. Indiana Dep’t Of Transp., 344 F.3d\n\n720, 727 (7th Cir. 2003) (citing Miller v. Am. Family Mut. Ins.\n\nCo., 203 F.3d 997, 1008 (7th Cir. 2000) (“An employee can honestly\n\nbelieve she is the object of discrimination, but if she never\n\nmentions it, a claim of retaliation is not implicated, for an\n\nemployer cannot retaliate when it is unaware of any complaints.”));\n\nWatts v. Kroger Co., 170 F.3d 505, 512 (5th Cir. 1999); Galdieri-\n\n\n      2\n       The Supreme Court of Maine has stated that “the Maine\nlegislature by adopting provisions that generally track the federal\nantidiscrimination statutes intended the courts to look to the\nfederal case law to provide significant guidance in the\nconstruction of our statute.” Maine Human Rights Comm’n v. City of\nAuburn, 408 A.2d 1253, 1261 (Me. 1979) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).   Therefore, cases discussing Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), may be applied in\nadjudications under the MHRA. See Bowen, 606 A.2d at 1054-55.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fAmbrosini v. Nat’l Realty & Dev. Corp., 136 F.3d 276, 292 (2d Cir.\n\n1998); Wiehoff v. GTE Directories Corp., 61 F.3d 588, 597-98 (8th\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n            Stinson summarizes her argument on appeal so as to\n\nattempt to avoid the controlling law.          She states in her brief that\n\n“she told the employee hot line of Correia’s abusive behavior; that\n\nhe did not treat the male salesmen in a similar manner and that\n\nCorreia’s   behavior    was    based    on   her    gender.”    This   artful\n\ncircumlocution finds no support in her complaint, which carefully\n\navoids alleging that she complained to her employer of a hostile\n\nwork environment based on gender.            Stinson argues that the Court\n\ncould   infer   that   she    communicated     to   her   employer   that   her\n\ncomplaints of a hostile environment were based upon her sex or\n\ngender. But it hardly would be reasonable to draw an inference to\n\nsupply an essential element of Stinson’s case omitted from her\n\ncomplaint after the District Court had warned her that the omission\n\nwould be fatal. See In re Colonial Mortgage Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d\n\nat 15; see also Martin, 284 F.3d at 6. This Circuit has held that\n\n     minimal requirements [of notice pleading] are not\n     tantamount to nonexistent requirements. The threshold\n     may be low, but it is real--and it is the plaintiff's\n     burden to take the step which brings his case safely into\n     the next phase of the litigation. The court need not\n     conjure up unpled allegations or contrive elaborately\n     arcane scripts in order to carry the blushing bride\n     through the portal.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fGooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d 513, 514 (1st Cir. 1988).3\n\n          We conclude that Stinson’s factual allegations “hold out\n\nno hope of recovery on any theory adumbrated in [her] complaint.”\n\nIn re Colonial Mortgage Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d at 15.\n\n                           CONCLUSION\n\n     The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n        Materials beyond the amended complaint also fail to\ndemonstrate that Stinson registered a complaint of sex or gender-\nbased hostility. Stinson suggests that a memo summarizing her call\nto an employee concern line demonstrates sufficient allegations of\na sexually hostile environment.    However, Stinson’s second-hand\naccount of a single incident involving an employee (not Correia)\nand a customer lacks sufficient significance to demonstrate the\npresence of a sexually hostile workplace environment.          The\nincident’s placement in the memo as the final specific complaint,\nfollowing numerous other complaints unrelated to sex or gender,\nfurther mitigates its relevance.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",

Because of Correia’s abuse and creation of a hostile\n     environment, in November of 2003, Plaintiff called\n     Defendant’s employee Concern Line to complain about\n     Correia. During the phone call, Plaintiff specifically\n     complained   Correia   had   created   a   hostile   work\n     environment. Plaintiff [sic] complaint to Defendant of\n     the hostile work environment was made in good faith\n     belief that he had created a hostile environment based on\n     her sex and she communicated her complaint to Defendant\n     in good faith.\n\n     . . .\n\n     21. When speaking to Plaintiff, Correia would frequently\n     raise his voice or yell at her. He did not treat male\n     workers in a similar manner.\n\nThe amended complaint then stated her claim under the MHRA in the\n\nfollowing terms:\n\n     32. In November of 2003, Plaintiff complained in good\n     faith to Defendant that her supervisor, Joseph Correia,\n     was subjecting her to a hostile work environment.\n     Plaintiff communicated the complaint to Defendant in good\n     faith and truly believed that she had been the victim of\n     a hostile environment.\n\n             The   District   Court   concluded     that    though   Stinson’s\n\namended   complaint      contained     references      to    alleged    sexual\n\nharassment,    she   failed   to   allege    that   she    complained   to   her\n\nemployer about a sexually hostile environment and thus “still\n\nfail[ed] to allege activity that states a claim for retaliation\n\nunder the Main Human Rights Act.”           The court considered Stinson’s\n\ncareful phrasing of the amended complaint as intentional, given its\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fprior   reference    to    the    strictures      of    Federal   Rule     of   Civil\n\nProcedure 11, and because Stinson had ample opportunity to cure the\n\ndeficiency    in   her    pleading,   the    court       dismissed    the   action.\n\nStinson now appeals the court’s judgment.\n\n                                   DISCUSSION\n\n           “This court applies a de novo standard of review to a\n\ndistrict court’s allowance of a motion to dismiss.” Martin v.\n\nApplied Cellular Tech., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199871\"><a href=\"/opinion/199871/martin-v-applied-cellular-tec/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(citing TAG/ICIB Servs., Inc. v.

She states in her brief that\n\n“she told the employee hot line of Correia’s abusive behavior; that\n\nhe did not treat the male salesmen in a similar manner and that\n\nCorreia’s   behavior    was    based    on   her    gender.”    This   artful\n\ncircumlocution finds no support in her complaint, which carefully\n\navoids alleging that she complained to her employer of a hostile\n\nwork environment based on gender.            Stinson argues that the Court\n\ncould   infer   that   she    communicated     to   her   employer   that   her\n\ncomplaints of a hostile environment were based upon her sex or\n\ngender. But it hardly would be reasonable to draw an inference to\n\nsupply an essential element of Stinson’s case omitted from her\n\ncomplaint after the District Court had warned her that the omission\n\nwould be fatal. See In re Colonial Mortgage Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d\n\nat 15; see also Martin, 284 F.3d at 6. This Circuit has held that\n\n     minimal requirements [of notice pleading] are not\n     tantamount to nonexistent requirements. The threshold\n     may be low, but it is real--and it is the plaintiff's\n     burden to take the step which brings his case safely into\n     the next phase of the litigation. The court need not\n     conjure up unpled allegations or contrive elaborately\n     arcane scripts in order to carry the blushing bride\n     through the portal.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fGooley v.

Stinson suggests that a memo summarizing her call\nto an employee concern line demonstrates sufficient allegations of\na sexually hostile environment.    However, Stinson’s second-hand\naccount of a single incident involving an employee (not Correia)\nand a customer lacks sufficient significance to demonstrate the\npresence of a sexually hostile workplace environment.          The\nincident’s placement in the memo as the final specific complaint,\nfollowing numerous other complaints unrelated to sex or gender,\nfurther mitigates its relevance.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f</pre>",
