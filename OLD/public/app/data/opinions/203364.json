On November 18, 2005, the\n\nRodríguez family (\"Plaintiffs\") filed a medical malpractice claim\n\nagainst   Federico     Trilla   Hospital     (\"Federico     Trilla\"),     unnamed\n\ninsurers, companies, and persons (\"Defendants\").              The claim stems\n\nfrom incidents surrounding the June 1988 birth of Plaintiffs' son,\n\nJVR, at Federico Trilla, which after 1999 was known as Servicios\n\nMédicos Universitarios (\"SMU\").             Defendants filed a motion for\n\nsummary judgment, which the district court granted based on its\n\ninterpretation of the Asset Purchase Agreement (\"APA\") entered into\n\nby the past and present owners of the hospital. Plaintiffs appeal.\n\nAfter   careful    consideration,     we    affirm    the   grant    of   summary\n\njudgment.\n\n                                I.   Background\n\n            We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nnon-movant, here Plaintiffs.         See Ramos-Santiago v. United Parcel\n\nServ., 524 F.3d 120, 122 (1st Cir. 2008).            In 1997, the Puerto Rico\n\nlegislature    approved    an   amendment     to   the   organic    law   of   the\n\nUniversity of Puerto Rico (\"UPR\") to authorize the creation of a\n\nsubsidiary to offer services to the university community and the\n\ngeneral population.        Under this authority, SMU was created and\n\nincorporated      as   a   non-profit      organization.       SMU     commenced\n\noperations and administered Federico Trilla once it was acquired by\n\nUPR from the Department of Health in March 1999.                    SMU acquired\n\nFederico Trilla when it entered into the APA with the Health\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fFacilities     and   Services   Administration   (\"HFSA\")   and   other\n\ngovernment entities.\n\n             JVR, the son of Omayra Rodríguez Rivera and José Vázquez\n\nNieves, was born in June 1988 at Federico Trilla, where he suffered\n\ndistress, lack of oxygen, and a left parietal fracture resulting in\n\nsevere, long-term mental and physical damage.         On November 18,\n\n2005, Plaintiffs filed a medical malpractice claim in the district\n\ncourt against SMU claiming that the hospital inadequately managed\n\nthe labor and delivery of JVR.1\n\n             On September 26, 2006, SMU filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment on two grounds: Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity and\n\nimproper party because the hospital was purchased in 1999 by virtue\n\nof an APA.    Appellants asked the district court to deny the motion\n\nbecause SMU had not yet responded to all of the requests for\n\nadmission and interrogatories that pertained to the motion.         The\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment for SMU on the basis of\n\nthe APA.     Plaintiffs appealed.\n\n\n\n\n1\n   Appellants filed a prior lawsuit based on the same operative\nfacts against the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and other defendants\nin commonwealth court in 1997. After several years of litigation,\nPlaintiffs requested a voluntary dismissal without prejudice, but\nthe court ordered that the case be dismissed with prejudice, except\nas for JVR's claims since he was a minor.       Final judgment was\nentered on April 27, 2001.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f                            II.   Discussion\n\n            A.   Standard of Review\n\n            We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo.    See Thompson v. Coca-Cola Co., 522 F.3d 168, 175 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).     We will reverse only if, \"after reviewing the facts and\n\nmaking all inferences in favor of the non-moving party [here,\n\nPlaintiffs], the evidence on record is sufficiently open-ended to\n\npermit a rational factfinder to resolve the issue in favor of\n\neither side.\"    Maymí v. P.R. Ports Auth., 515 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir.\n\n2008) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n            Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law based on the pleadings, depositions,\n\nanswers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and any affidavits.\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Thompson, 522 F.3d at 175.     \"'A dispute\n\nis genuine if the evidence about the fact is such that a reasonable\n\njury could resolve the point in the favor of the non-moving\n\nparty.'\"    Thompson, 522 F.3d at 175 (quoting Sánchez v. Alvarado,\n\n101 F.3d 223, 227 (1st Cir. 1996)).      \"A fact is material if it has\n\nthe potential of determining the outcome of the litigation.\"\n\nMaymí, 515 F.3d at 25.\n\n            B.   Asset Purchase Agreement\n\n            Plaintiffs argue that the Defendants' motion for summary\n\njudgment should have been denied because SMU failed to provide\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fdiscovery that pertained to material facts.     Plaintiffs contend\n\nthat the interrogatories included specific questions and requests\n\nthat would have influenced the outcome of the summary judgment\n\nmotion.   We disagree.\n\n           District courts have broad discretion in determining the\n\ntiming of pre-trial discovery and we are reluctant to interfere\n\nunless it clearly appears that \"a discovery order was plainly wrong\n\nand resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.\"\n\nMack v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 186 (1st Cir.\n\n1989).    The question here is whether, according to the APA, SMU\n\ncould be held liable for any malpractice claims stemming from acts\n\nthat occurred prior to it acquiring the hospital.   We can discern\n\nthe answer to this question by simply reading the language of the\n\nAPA in the record we have before us.     Article 1.1(a) of the APA\n\nstates in unambiguous language:\n\n           Sale of Assets.     Subject to the terms and\n           conditions set fourth in this Agreement on\n           this date (the \"Closing Date\") and in this act\n           (the \"Closing\"), Sellers transfer, assign,\n           convey and deliver to Buyer, and cause the\n           transfer, assignment, conveyance and delivery\n           to Buyer of all rights, title and interests in\n           and to certain tangible assets consisting of\n           certain   real   properties,   the   buildings\n           thereon, equipment, and machinery, whether\n           installed     or    uninstalled,     leasehold\n           improvements, office equipment and furniture,\n           certain telephone lines, licenses and other\n           assets (of every kind, nature, character and\n           description, whether real or personal, which\n           are used in the Facilities), including all\n           rights and interests which are held for use in\n           or relating in any manner to the Facilities\n\n                                  -5-\n\f            (hereinafter collectively the \"Assets\"), free\n            and clear of all claims, liens, charges,\n            liabilities, obligations, contracts, rights,\n            options,   security   interests,   mortgages,\n            encumbrances and restrictions of any kind or\n            nature, whether absolute, accrued, contingent\n            or otherwise (collectively, the \"Claims\")\n            except for Permitted Liens (as defined in\n            Sections 3.2(c) and 3.3(c)).\n\nAsset Purchase Agreement, March 12, 1999 (emphasis added).\n\n            While     \"Rule    56(f)   allows   a     party   opposing   summary\n\njudgment additional time to conduct discovery on matters related to\n\nthe motion,\" C.B. Trucking, Inc. v. Waste Mgmt., Inc., 137 F.3d 41,\n\n44 (1st Cir. 1998), requests for additional discovery will not\n\nalways prevent the district court from acting on the motion for\n\nsummary judgment.          See Bank One Texas, N.A. v. A.J. Warehouse,\n\nInc., 968 F.2d 94, 100 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"'[A] court may grant\n\nsummary judgment despite an opposing party's claim that discovery\n\nwould yield additional facts where the opposing party has not\n\nalleged    specific    facts    that   could    be    developed   through     such\n\ndiscovery.'\" (quoting Taylor v. Gallagher, 737 F.2d 134, 137 (1st\n\nCir.   1984))).       In   their   opposition    to    summary    judgment,   the\n\nPlaintiffs failed to demonstrate how additional discovery might\n\nadvance their cause.          Moreover, in light of the clear wording of\n\nthe APA, we do not believe they can make such a showing.                      The\n\ninterrogatories that SMU allegedly failed to answer addressed facts\n\npertaining to the medical record and the treatment provided to JVR\n\nin 1988.     These interrogatories did not go to whether SMU had\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\facquired the liabilities of its predecessor, and so they were\n\nirrelevant.2\n\n           The discovery pertaining to the APA itself was also\n\nirrelevant.    The document spoke for itself.       Given the language of\n\nthe APA, it was clear to the district court, as it is clear to us,\n\nthat the answers that Plaintiffs sought would not have changed the\n\noutcome of the case.3    See id.    The terms and conditions of the APA\n\nclearly demonstrate that SMU did not assume \"any obligations or\n\nliabilities in connection with or related to the Facilities, or\n\nwhich may affect the Assets, or to which the Facilities or the\n\nAssets   are   subject   or   by   which   they   may   be   bound,   or   any\n\nliabilities or obligations of the Sellers which relate in any\n\nmanner to the operation of the Assets and the Facilities on or\n\nprior to the agreement.\"       Asset Purchase Agreement, art. 1.9(a).\n\n\n\n\n2\n   For example, the Plaintiffs requested answers to the following\ninterrogatories:   (1)   State whether SMU or the University of\nPuerto Rico assert or asserted that facts alleged in the complaint\nare an indemnifiable event pursuant to article 9 of APA. Provide\ncopies of documents relating to this assertion and provide the\nbasis for such assertion. (2) State whether SMU or UPR notified\nany of the Sellers of the APU regarding the filing or facts of\npresent case. Provide copy of relevant documentation.\n3\n   For example, the Plaintiff requested answers to the following\nadmissions: (1) Admit that the APA does not specifically waive\nbuyer's responsibility for malpractice claims with respect to facts\nthat occurred prior to the execution of the APA. (2) Admit that\nthe APA does not specifically waive buyer's responsibility for\nmalpractice claims initiated or filed after the execution of the\nAPA. (3) Admit that plaintiffs were not parties to the APA. (4)\nAdmit that plaintiffs did not consent to the APA.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fThe terms of the APA are clear and unmistakable and Plaintiffs'\n\nclaims fail.\n\n           There is no allegation that SMU was the owner of the\n\nhospital when JVR was born, or that it became the successor in\n\ninterest of the prior owner. As the APA demonstrates, the contract\n\nbetween UPR, HFSA, and other entities, specifically and expressly\n\nstates that the sale of the assets was made \"free and clear of all\n\nclaims,   liens,    charges,   liabilities,    obligations,   contracts,\n\nrights, options, etc.\"     Asset Purchase Agreement, art. 1.1.      The\n\nvery terms of the APA demonstrate that SMU cannot be held liable\n\nfor any acts or omissions of the previous owners and/or operators\n\nof the hospital.4\n\n                           III.   Conclusion\n\n           For the reasons mentioned above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  Because we find that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment\nbased on the APA, we do not need to examine the issues raised by\nthe Eleventh Amendment defense.\n\n                                   -8-\n\f",

(2) State whether SMU or UPR notified any of the Sellers of the APU regarding the filing or facts of present case. Provide copy of relevant documentation.</p>\n<p>[3]  For example, the Plaintiff requested answers to the following admissions: (1) Admit that the APA does not specifically waive buyer's responsibility for malpractice claims with respect to facts that occurred prior to the execution of the APA. (2) Admit that the APA does not specifically waive buyer's responsibility for malpractice claims initiated or filed after the execution of the APA. (3) Admit that plaintiffs were not parties to the APA. (4) Admit that plaintiffs did not consent to the APA.</p>\n<p>[4]  Because we find that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment based on the APA, we do not need to examine the issues raised by the Eleventh Amendment defense.</p>\n\n</div>",

The claim stems from incidents surrounding the June 1988 birth of Plaintiffs' son, JVR, at Federico Trilla, which after 1999 was known as Servicios Médicos Universitarios (\"SMU\"). Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted based on its interpretation of the Asset Purchase Agreement (\"APA\") entered into by the past and present owners of the hospital. Plaintiffs appeal. After careful consideration, we affirm the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant, here Plaintiffs. <i>See </i><i>Ramos-Santiago v. United Parcel Serv.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></span>, 122 (1st Cir.2008). In 1997, the Puerto Rico legislature approved an amendment to the organic law of the University of Puerto Rico (\"UPR\") to authorize the creation of a subsidiary to offer services to the university community <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> and the general population. Under this authority, SMU was created and incorporated as a non-profit organization. SMU commenced operations and administered Federico Trilla once it was acquired by UPR from the Department of Health in March 1999. SMU acquired Federico Trilla when it entered into the APA with the Health Facilities and Services Administration (\"HFSA\") and other government entities.</p>\n<p>JVR, the son of Omayra Rodríguez Rivera and José Vázquez Nieves, was born in June 1988 at Federico Trilla, where he suffered distress, lack of oxygen, and a left parietal fracture resulting in severe, long-term mental and physical damage. On November 18, 2005, Plaintiffs filed a medical malpractice claim in the district court against SMU claiming that the hospital inadequately managed the labor and delivery of JVR.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>On September 26, 2006, SMU filed a motion for summary judgment on two grounds: Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity and improper party because the hospital was purchased in 1999 by virtue of an APA. Appellants asked the district court to deny the motion because SMU had not yet responded to all of the requests for admission and interrogatories that pertained to the motion. The district court granted summary judgment for SMU on the basis of the APA. Plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo. See </i><i>Thompson v. Coca-Cola Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203244\"><a href=\"/opinion/203244/thompson-v-coca-cola-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span>, 175 (1st Cir.2008). We will reverse only if, \"after reviewing the facts and making all inferences in favor of the non-moving party [here, Plaintiffs], the evidence on record is sufficiently open-ended to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the issue in favor of either side.\" <i>Maymí v. P.R.

Alvarado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729931\"><a href=\"/opinion/729931/72-fair-emplpraccas-bna-975-69-empl-prac-dec-p-44489-maria-de-los/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 227 (1st Cir.1996)). \"A fact is material if it has the potential of determining the outcome of the litigation.\" <i>Maymí,</i> 515 F.3d at 25.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Asset Purchase Agreement</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that the Defendants' motion for summary judgment should have been denied because SMU failed to provide discovery that pertained to material facts. Plaintiffs contend that the interrogatories included specific questions and requests that would have influenced the outcome of the summary judgment motion. We disagree.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> District courts have broad discretion in determining the timing of pre-trial discovery and we are reluctant to interfere unless it clearly appears that \"a discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.\" <i>Mack v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520577\"><a href=\"/opinion/520577/thomasina-mack-v-the-great-atlantic-and-pacific-tea-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span>, 186 (1st Cir.1989). The question here is whether, according to the APA, SMU could be held liable for any malpractice claims stemming from acts that occurred prior to it acquiring the hospital. We can discern the answer to this question by simply reading the language of the APA in the record we have before us. Article 1.1(a) of the APA states in unambiguous language:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<i>Sale of Assets.</i> Subject to the terms and conditions set fourth in this Agreement on this date (the \"Closing Date\") and in this act (the \"Closing\"), Sellers transfer, assign, convey and deliver to Buyer, and cause the transfer, assignment, conveyance and delivery to Buyer of all rights, title and interests in and to certain tangible assets consisting of certain real properties, the buildings thereon, equipment, and machinery, whether installed or uninstalled, leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture, certain telephone lines, licenses and other assets (of every kind, nature, character and description, whether real or personal, which are used in the Facilities), including all rights and interests which are held for use in or relating in any manner to the Facilities (hereinafter collectively the \"Assets\"), <i>free and clear of all claims, liens, charges, liabilities, obligations,</i> contracts, rights, options, security interests, mortgages, encumbrances and restrictions <i>of any kind or nature, whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise</i> (collectively, the \"Claims\") except for Permitted Liens (as defined in Sections 3.2(c) and 3.3(c)).</blockquote>\n<p>Asset Purchase Agreement, March 12, 1999 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>While \"Rule 56(f) allows a party opposing summary judgment additional time to conduct discovery on matters related to the motion,\" <i>C.B. Trucking, Inc. v. Waste Mgmt., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197813\"><a href=\"/opinion/197813/cb-trucking-inc-v-waste/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.1998), requests for additional discovery will not always prevent the district court from acting on the motion for summary judgment. <i>See </i><i>Bank One Texas, N.A. v. A.J. Warehouse, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586284\"><a href=\"/opinion/586284/bank-one-texas-na-v-aj-warehouse-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 100 (1st Cir.1992) (\"`[A] court may grant summary judgment despite an opposing party's claim that discovery would yield additional facts where the opposing party has not alleged specific facts that could be developed through such discovery.'\" (quoting <i>Taylor v. Gallagher,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437456\"><a href=\"/opinion/437456/elliot-w-taylor-v-robert-j-gallagher/\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 137 (1st Cir.1984))). In their opposition to summary judgment, the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate how additional discovery might advance their cause. Moreover, in light of the clear wording of the APA, we do not believe they can make such a showing. The interrogatories that SMU allegedly failed to answer addressed facts pertaining to the medical record and the treatment provided to JVR in 1988. These interrogatories did not go to whether SMU had acquired the liabilities of its predecessor, and so they were irrelevant.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> The discovery pertaining to the APA itself was also irrelevant. The document spoke for itself. Given the language of the APA, it was clear to the district court, as it is clear to us, that the answers that Plaintiffs sought would not have changed the outcome of the case.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See id.</i> The terms and conditions of the APA clearly demonstrate that SMU did not assume \"any obligations or liabilities in connection with or related to the Facilities, or which may affect the Assets, or to which the Facilities or the Assets are subject or by which they may be bound, or any liabilities or obligations of the Sellers which relate in any manner to the operation of the Assets and the Facilities on or prior to the agreement.\" Asset Purchase Agreement, art. 1.9(a). The terms of the APA are clear and unmistakable and Plaintiffs' claims fail.</p>\n<p>There is no allegation that SMU was the owner of the hospital when JVR was born, or that it became the successor in interest of the prior owner. As the APA demonstrates, the contract between UPR, HFSA, and other entities, specifically and expressly states that the sale of the assets was made \"free and clear of all claims, liens, charges, liabilities, obligations, contracts, rights, options, etc.\" Asset Purchase Agreement, art. 1.1. The very terms of the APA demonstrate that SMU cannot be held liable for any acts or omissions of the previous owners and/or operators of the hospital.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the reasons mentioned above, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Appellants filed a prior lawsuit based on the same operative facts against the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and other defendants in commonwealth court in 1997. After several years of litigation, Plaintiffs requested a voluntary dismissal without prejudice, but the court ordered that the case be dismissed with prejudice, except as for JVR's claims since he was a minor. Final judgment was entered on April 27, 2001.</p>\n<p>[2]  For example, the Plaintiffs requested answers to the following interrogatories: (1) State whether SMU or the University of Puerto Rico assert or asserted that facts alleged in the complaint are an indemnifiable event pursuant to article 9 of APA. Provide copies of documents relating to this assertion and provide the basis for such assertion. (2) State whether SMU or UPR notified any of the Sellers of the APU regarding the filing or facts of present case. Provide copy of relevant documentation.</p>\n<p>[3]  For example, the Plaintiff requested answers to the following admissions: (1) Admit that the APA does not specifically waive buyer's responsibility for malpractice claims with respect to facts that occurred prior to the execution of the APA. (2) Admit that the APA does not specifically waive buyer's responsibility for malpractice claims initiated or filed after the execution of the APA. (3) Admit that plaintiffs were not parties to the APA. (4) Admit that plaintiffs did not consent to the APA.</p>\n<p>[4]  Because we find that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment based on the APA, we do not need to examine the issues raised by the Eleventh Amendment defense.</p>\n\n</div>",
