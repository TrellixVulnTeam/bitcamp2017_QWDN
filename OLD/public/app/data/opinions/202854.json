The en banc court has convened to\n\nconsider a series of issues concerning the relative powers of the\n\nfederal Secretary of the Interior, the State of Rhode Island, and\n\nthe Narragansett Tribe over a parcel of land taken into trust and\n\ndesignated for Indian housing.          The case is in many ways a proxy\n\nfor the State's larger concerns about its sovereignty vis-à-vis\n\nfederal and tribal control over lands within the state.\n\n           In 1998, the Secretary of the Interior agreed to take\n\ninto unreserved trust for the Tribe's benefit a 31- or 32-acre\n\nparcel in Charlestown, Rhode Island (the Parcel).             Then-Secretary\n\nGale   Norton   cited   her   powers    under   section   5   of   the    Indian\n\nReorganization Act of 1934 (IRA), 25 U.S.C. § 465.             The Tribe had\n\npurchased the Parcel in 1991.\n\n           Under the Indian Commerce Clause of the Constitution,\n\nU.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3, Congress has plenary power to\n\nlegislate on the subject of Indian tribes.         Cotton Petroleum Corp.\n\nv. New Mexico, 490 U.S. 163, 192 (1989).         As a result, Congress may\n\npreempt the operation of state law in Indian country.                    See New\n\nMexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe, 462 U.S. 324, 333 (1983).                Under\n\nsection 5 of the IRA, Congress has authorized the Secretary \"in his\n\ndiscretion\" to acquire and take into trust for Indian tribes \"any\n\ninterest in lands . . . within or without existing reservations\n\n. . . for the purpose of providing land for Indians.\"               25 U.S.C.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f§ 465.    The Secretary may take land into trust for these purposes,\n\nas was done here, without the consent of the State.1\n\n            The   Secretary's   acquisition   of   land   into   trust   for\n\nIndians results in the land becoming \"Indian country.\"            18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1151. Generally speaking, primary jurisdiction over land that is\n\nIndian country rests with the federal government and the Indian\n\ntribe inhabiting it, not with the state.      Alaska v. Native Vill. of\n\nVenetie Tribal Gov't, 522 U.S. 520, 527 n.1 (1988).              To be more\n\nprecise,\n\n            \"[w]hen on-reservation conduct involving only\n            Indians is at issue, state law is generally\n            inapplicable, for the State's regulatory\n            interest is likely to be minimal and the\n            federal interest in encouraging tribal self-\n            government is at its strongest.\"         When,\n            however,   state    interests    outside   the\n            reservation are implicated, States [sometimes]\n            may regulate the activities even of tribe\n            members on tribal land . . . .\n\nNevada v. Hicks, 533 U.S. 353, 362 (2001) (citation omitted)\n\n(quoting White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136, 144\n\n(1980)).\n\n            Recognizing a conflict between state jurisdiction and the\n\nfederal    interest   in   encouraging   tribal    self-governance,      the\n\nSecretary's regulations under the IRA provide that \"none of the\n\nlaws . . . of any State . . . limiting, zoning or otherwise\n\n\n\n     1\n          By contrast, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act provides\nthe State with a limited role in determining whether land is taken\ninto trust for gaming purposes. See 25 U.S.C. § 2719(b)(1)(A).\n\n                                   -5-\n\fgoverning, regulating, or controlling the use or development of any\n\nreal or personal property . . . shall be applicable\" to land held\n\nin trust for a tribe by the United States.     25 C.F.R. § 1.4(a).\n\nThis provision is subject to the Secretary's power in specific\n\ncases or areas to make applicable those local laws determined to be\n\nin the best interest of the Indian owners \"in achieving the highest\n\nand best use of [the] property.\"    Id. § 1.4(b).\n\n           Concerned over the loss of sovereignty over the Parcel\n\nand what it may portend for the future, the State, its Governor,\n\nand the town of Charlestown (collectively, the State), sued the\n\nSecretary of the Interior, now Dirk Kempthorne, and the Regional\n\nDirector of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Franklin Keel, in\n\nfederal court.   See Carcieri v. Norton, 290 F. Supp. 2d 167 (D.R.I.\n\n2003). Having exhausted administrative remedies, the State brought\n\nsuit under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 702,\n\nseeking review of the Secretary's decision to take the Parcel into\n\ntrust.   Id. at 169, 172.\n\n           The State's case asserts three major theories.    First,\n\nthe State argues that the IRA does not authorize the Secretary to\n\ntake land into trust for any tribe, including the Narragansetts,\n\nthat first received federal recognition after June 18, 1934, the\n\neffective date of the IRA.   Second, the State argues that the 1978\n\nRhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act (the Settlement Act), 25\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1701-1716, restricts the Secretary's authority to place\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fthe Parcel into trust pursuant to the IRA.   Third, the State argues\n\nthat the Constitution prohibits this exercise of authority by the\n\nSecretary.2\n\n          As to the IRA, the State argues that the Narragansetts do\n\nnot meet the definition of \"Indian\" contained in 25 U.S.C. § 479.\n\nThe pertinent definition recognizes, inter alia, \"all persons of\n\nIndian descent who are members of any recognized Indian tribe now\n\nunder Federal jurisdiction.\"    25 U.S.C. § 479 (emphasis added).\n\nThe State reads \"are members . . . now under Federal jurisdiction\"\n\nto plainly and literally mean the 1934 effective date of the IRA.\n\nThe State thus contends that the Secretary has no authority under\n\nthe IRA to take land into trust for any tribe that was not\n\nfederally recognized in 1934.   As a result, the State argues, the\n\nSecretary is precluded entirely from placing the Parcel into trust\n\nfor the Narragansetts, who were not recognized as a tribe until\n\n1983.\n\n          Next, the State argues that the terms of the Settlement\n\nAct preclude the Secretary from placing the Parcel into trust\n\n\n     2\n          The State's challenges to the Secretary's authority under\nthe IRA and the Constitution have national implications that reach\nbeyond Rhode Island; accordingly, ten states and the National\nCoalition Against Gambling Expansion have filed amicus briefs in\nsupport of Rhode Island. Similarly, numerous tribes and tribal\norganizations have filed amicus briefs in support of the Secretary.\nWe acknowledge the able assistance provided by the amici curiae\nstates and National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion on behalf\nof the State, and amici curiae National Congress of American\nIndians, individual Indian tribes and tribal organizations, and the\nMississippi Band of Choctaw Indians on behalf of the Secretary.\n\n                                -7-\n\fbecause the Settlement Act is a later specific act of Congress that\n\nmust be read to have explicitly and implicitly cabined the Tribe's\n\nand the Secretary's power as to the Parcel.         The State argues that\n\nthe Settlement Act bars the imposition of any trust.            The State's\n\nfallback position is that any trust must be restricted by the terms\n\nof the Settlement Act so that it is clear that state and local law\n\napply to the Parcel, just as they do to the settlement lands.\n\n            Finally,     the   State    asserts   various    constitutional\n\ntheories, with the common underpinning that the placing of the\n\nParcel into trust violates the State's sovereignty.               The State\n\nargues that the Indian Commerce Clause does not authorize the\n\nSecretary's exercise of power and that the exercise violates the\n\nTenth Amendment, as well as the Enclave and Admissions Clauses of\n\nthe Constitution.       The State also argues that section 5 of the IRA,\n\n25 U.S.C. § 465, constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of\n\nlegislative authority.\n\n            We hold that the language of 25 U.S.C. § 479 does not\n\nplainly refer to the 1934 enactment date of the IRA.            We find that\n\nthe text is sufficiently ambiguous in its use of the term \"now\"\n\nthat the Secretary has, under the Chevron doctrine, authority to\n\nconstrue the Act.       We reject the State's claim that we do not owe\n\ndeference    to   the    Secretary's    interpretation      because   he   has\n\ninconsistently interpreted or applied section 479.              The State's\n\nevidence of inconsistency is mixed and is not persuasive.                  The\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fSecretary's    position    has    not          been    inconsistent,      much    less\n\narbitrary.     The Secretary's interpretation is rational and not\n\ninconsistent with the statutory language or legislative history,\n\nand must be honored.\n\n           Likewise, the Settlement Act neither explicitly bars by\n\nits terms the Secretary's actions, nor implicitly repeals or\n\nconstrains the Secretary's authority under the IRA to place land\n\ninto trust for the Tribe.         While the State apparently failed to\n\nanticipate this particular problem at the time of the settlement,\n\nthe Settlement Act did specifically contemplate the event of\n\nfederal   recognition     of   the    Tribe       and     did   not   restrict    the\n\nSecretary's power, should the Tribe be recognized, to take into\n\ntrust land outside of the settlement lands.                     We are not free to\n\nreform the Act.     If aggrieved, the State must turn to Congress.\n\n           The State's arguments based on allocations of power under\n\nthe U.S. Constitution also do not prevail.                      They do, however,\n\nunderscore    the   seriousness      of    the        State's   concern   about   the\n\nabrogation of state sovereignty at stake here.\n\n                                          I.\n\n           In order to understand the nature of the controversy and\n\nthe consequences of this decision, a brief recounting of the\n\nhistory of relations between the State and the Tribe is required.\n\nFurther background can be found in the district court's opinion,\n\nCarcieri, 290 F. Supp. 2d 167, as well as the opinions previously\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fissued in the decades-long disputes between the State and the\n\nTribe, see Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Rhode Island (Narragansett\n\nIII), 449 F.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc); Narragansett Indian\n\nTribe v. Narragansett Elec. Co. (Narragansett II), 89 F.3d 908 (1st\n\nCir. 1996); Rhode Island v. Narragansett Indian Tribe (Narragansett\n\nI), 19 F.3d 685 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n          In 1880, the State acquired the majority of the Tribe's\n\nlands.    In   1934,   the   Tribe    organized    as   a   state-chartered\n\ncorporation. In 1975, the Tribe sued to recover its lands, arguing\n\nthat the State had acquired the lands in violation of the Indian\n\nNonintercourse Act, 25 U.S.C. § 177.         The Tribe claimed that this\n\nviolation rendered void the transfer of title to the lands.\n\n          This cloud on title prompted the State to enter into\n\nsettlement negotiations with the Tribe, which led in 1978 to an\n\nagreement embodied in a Joint Memorandum of Understanding (JMOU).\n\nUnder the JMOU, the Tribe would receive 1800 acres of \"settlement\n\nlands,\" half of which were provided by the State and half of which\n\nwere purchased with federal funds.          The State agreed to create an\n\nIndian-controlled corporation to hold the settlement lands in trust\n\nfor the Tribe, to exempt the settlement lands from local taxation,\n\nand to help secure the federal legislation necessary to implement\n\nthe agreement.    In exchange, the Tribe abandoned its claims of\n\naboriginal title and its claims to lands in the state other than\n\nthe settlement lands.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f             In turn, Congress approved and codified the agreement in\n\nthe   Settlement      Act.    The    Settlement     Act   provided    that   \"the\n\nsettlement lands shall be subject to the civil and criminal laws\n\nand jurisdiction of the State of Rhode Island.\"               Id. § 1708(a).\n\n             Five years later, in 1983, the Secretary granted the\n\nTribe official federal recognition.            See Final Determination for\n\nFederal   Acknowledgment      of     Narragansett    Indian   Tribe    of    Rhode\n\nIsland,   48   Fed.    Reg.   6177    (Feb.   10,   1983).     Following     that\n\nrecognition, in 1985, Rhode Island amended the pertinent state\n\nstatute to permit the conveyance of the settlement lands directly\n\nto the Tribe, explicitly preserving the State's jurisdiction over\n\nthe settlement lands, consistent with the Settlement Act, 25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1708(a).     See R.I. Gen. Laws § 37-18-13(b).           The holding company\n\nconveyed the settlement lands to the Tribe, and three years later,\n\nthe Tribe conveyed the settlement lands to the BIA as trustee.                The\n\ntrust deed confirmed the application of state law to the settlement\n\nlands, as provided in 25 U.S.C. § 1708(a).                The BIA continues to\n\nhold the settlement lands in trust for the Tribe, subject to this\n\ncongressionally-enacted restriction that state law applies.                   See\n\nNarragansett I, 19 F.3d at 689, 695 n.8.              Significantly, in our\n\nearlier en banc decision in Narragansett III, we held that the\n\nlanguage of section 1708(a) trumped any residual tribal sovereignty\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fover the settlement lands, under which the Tribe had refused to\n\ncomply with certain state laws.3     See 449 F.3d at 26.\n\n          Then, in 1991, the tribal housing authority purchased the\n\nParcel in fee simple, acquiring title through purchase from a\n\nprivate developer.   The Parcel was part of the Tribe's aboriginal\n\nlands claimed in the 1976 lawsuit.     Under the Settlement Act, the\n\nTribe had thus relinquished aboriginal title to the Parcel, but the\n\nParcel is not part of the 1800 acres of settlement lands.        It is\n\nadjacent to the settlement lands, across a town road.      In 1992, the\n\nHousing Authority transferred the Parcel to the Tribe with a deed\n\nrestriction that the Parcel be placed in trust with the BIA for the\n\npurpose of providing housing.\n\n          A dispute soon arose over whether development of the\n\nParcel had to comply with local law.    The Tribe began construction\n\non the planned housing project without obtaining a building permit\n\nfrom the Town or the State's approval of the individual sewage\n\ndisposal systems.    The Tribe essentially took the position that\n\nonce it had purchased the Parcel, the land had become tribal land,\n\nand the Tribe's inherent sovereignty meant that the Parcel was\n\nexempt from local law.    The State disagreed and filed suit in\n\nfederal court to enjoin the Tribe.     See Narragansett Indian   Tribe\n\n\n\n     3\n          In \"an abundance of caution,\" we recognized that the\nTribe may still possess some autonomy in local government matters\nsuch as membership rules, inheritance rules, and regulation of\ndomestic relations. Narragansett III, 449 F.3d at 26.\n\n                                -12-\n\fv.   Narragansett   Elec.   Co.,     878    F.   Supp.   349   (D.R.I.    1995).\n\nUltimately, the Tribe lost that litigation.4             See Narragansett II,\n\n89 F.3d at 922.\n\n           The    Tribe   had     sought    to   solve   the   issue     of   the\n\napplicability of state law to the Parcel by applying to the\n\nSecretary in 1993 to have the Parcel taken into trust under section\n\n5 of the IRA.     The Secretary's determination of whether to do so\n\nwas stayed pending the resolution of the federal court litigation.\n\nAfter the litigation was resolved against the Tribe by this court\n\nin 1996, id. at 922, the Tribe submitted a second application to\n\nthe Secretary.\n\n           The   Tribe    filed    this    updated   application       with   the\n\nSecretary in July 1997.     In determining whether to take lands into\n\n\n      4\n          The Housing Authority was a duly recognized Indian\nhousing authority and was given HUD funds to finance the purchase\nof the property and the construction of approximately 50 units of\nhousing.   See Indian Housing Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1437aa-\n1437ff (repealed by Native American Housing Assistance and Self-\nDetermination Act of 1996, 25 U.S.C. §§ 4101-4243).\n          The district court found the proposed housing project\ncould be detrimental to coastal and groundwater resources, but also\nheld that the Parcel was a \"dependent Indian community\" within the\nmeaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1151(b) and therefore partially denied\ninjunctive relief. Narragansett Elec. Co., 878 F. Supp. at 355-57,\n366.   On appeal, this court held that the land for the housing\nproject was not a \"dependent Indian community\" because federal\nownership of the land and federal action to \"set aside\" the land\nwere lacking.   Narragansett II, 89 F.3d at 921-22.      Thus, the\nParcel could not be considered Indian country under 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1151(b), and the housing project being constructed on the site\nwas not exempt from state and local building and zoning\nrestrictions. Accordingly, this court reversed the district court\nand directed the district court to enter an order granting the\ninjunction. 89 F.3d at 922.\n\n                                     -13-\n\ftrust, the Secretary follows a regulatory process set forth at 25\n\nC.F.R. part 151, which requires consideration of several factors.\n\nIf, as here, the land is off reservation, additional criteria\n\napply.    See 25 C.F.R. § 151.11.                 Generally, the farther from a\n\nreservation the land is, the greater the scrutiny the Secretary\n\ngives    to    the    justification       of    anticipated   benefits   from   the\n\nacquisition.         See id. § 151.11(e); see also M.J. Sheppard, Taking\n\nIndian Land into Trust, 44 S.D. L. Rev. 681, 686 (1999).\n\n              On March 6, 1998, the BIA notified the State of the\n\nSecretary's intent to take the Parcel into trust for the Tribe.\n\nThe State appealed the decision to the Interior Board of Indian\n\nAppeals (IBIA).            The State argued, inter alia, that the Settlement\n\nAct prohibited this action by the Secretary, and that in taking the\n\nland into trust without the State's consent, the Secretary had\n\nacted    unconstitutionally.                The     IBIA   affirmed   the      BIA's\n\ndetermination on June 29, 2000.                 Town of Charlestown v. E. Area\n\nDir., Bureau of Indian Affairs, 35 I.B.I.A. 93, 106 (2000).                      It\n\nnoted     it         had      no     jurisdiction      over    the    claims     of\n\nunconstitutionality.5              Id. at 97.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n          The IBIA rejected the State's insistence that the\nSecretary take account of the potential use of the Parcel for\ngaming purposes under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C.\n§ 2701, calling such a possibility merely speculative. 35 I.B.I.A.\nat 103. The IBIA also concluded that there had been no violation\nof the Coastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. § 1451. 35 I.B.I.A.\nat 103.\n\n                                          -14-\n\f               The State then instituted this action in federal court.\n\nThe district court, in a comprehensive decision, rejected the\n\nState's claims.          See Carcieri, 290 F. Supp. 2d 167.           A divided\n\npanel of this court affirmed.            Carcieri v. Norton, 423 F.3d 45 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).         The en banc court granted rehearing and withdrew the\n\npanel opinion.\n\n               As described above and recounted in our en banc decision\n\nin Narragansett III, 449 F.3d at 18-21, for several decades the\n\nrelationship between the Tribe and the State has been fraught with\n\ntension.\n\n               The State's short-term concerns in this case have to do\n\nwith whether the particular project will conform with state and\n\nlocal law.          The State also has concerns that once land is taken\n\ninto       trust,    there   will   be    very   few   mechanisms,   other   than\n\nnegotiation with the Tribe or appeal to the Secretary's authority\n\nunder 25 C.F.R. § 1.4(b), by which the State may secure compliance\n\nwith state and local laws.6              The State fears that the Tribe will\n\n\n       6\n          At oral argument, the Secretary indicated that although\na tribe has civil regulatory jurisdiction over lands taken into\ntrust, a state may seek to enforce its laws -- to the extent they\nare not preempted by federal law -- on trust lands either by\nagreement with the tribe or by seeking a determination in federal\ncourt that the State's interests with respect to enforcing a\nparticular regulation outweigh the interests of the tribe and the\nfederal government in fostering tribal self-government. See Hicks,\n533 U.S. at 362 (\"When . . . state interests outside the\nreservation are implicated, States [sometimes] may regulate the\nactivities even of tribe members on tribal land.\"); see also id. at\n364 (holding that state officers may execute on tribal lands\nprocess related to off-reservation violations of state law);\n\n                                          -15-\n\fconvert or otherwise use the Parcel, or any future parcels that\n\nmight   be   acquired      and    put     into   trust,    for     income-producing\n\nactivities in which it normally would not be permitted to engage\n\nunder state law.\n\n             There has been federal litigation between state officials\n\nand the Tribe and its members over such activities.                     In 2003, the\n\nTribe, seeking revenue, established on the settlement lands an\n\nIndian Smoke Shop that sold cigarettes without purchasing state\n\ncigarette stamps or collecting sales taxes then paid to the State,\n\nas required by state law.              The State Police raided the smoke shop\n\nand initiated criminal prosecutions against tribe members.                        The\n\nTribe sought a declaratory judgment in federal court asserting that\n\nits control over the smoke shop was an inherent function of tribal\n\nsovereignty that survived the Settlement Act, despite the explicit\n\nlanguage in section 1708(a).               We rejected that claim en banc.\n\nNarragansett III, 449 F.3d at 30-31.\n\n                                           II.\n\nA.           Standard of Review\n\n             Technically,        the    claims   at   issue      here   are   reviewed\n\nthrough the lens of an APA appeal under 5 U.S.C. § 706.                   Our review\n\nof   such    an   appeal    is    de     novo    as   to   the    district    court's\n\nconclusions.      See Harvey v. Veneman, 396 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir.\n\n\nConfederated Tribes, 447 U.S. at 151 (explaining that the state\ncould require Indian tribes to collect taxes on sales of cigarettes\nto non-Indians). That issue is beyond the scope of this opinion.\n\n                                          -16-\n\f2005).    The underlying issues remaining in the case are statutory\n\nand constitutional.     Statutory issues are reviewed de novo by the\n\ncourts, but subject to established principles of deference to the\n\nadministering agency.     Id.   Constitutional claims are reviewed de\n\nnovo.    See Cousins v. Sec'y of Transp., 880 F.2d 603, 610 (1st Cir.\n\n1989) (en banc).\n\nB.          The 1934 Indian Reorganization Act\n\n            The State argues that the Secretary lacks authority to\n\nplace the Parcel into trust under 25 U.S.C. § 465 since, under the\n\ndefinition of \"Indian\" in 25 U.S.C. § 479, that authority extends\n\nonly to tribes that were both federally \"recognized\" and \"under\n\n[f]ederal jurisdiction\" on June 18, 1934, the effective date of the\n\nIRA.\n\n            The State presents a series of cascading arguments.\n\nFirst, the State argues that the plain language of section 479 is\n\nclear, and that under that plain language, the Tribe's status is\n\nmeasured    as   of   1934.     The    State   further   argues   that   its\n\ninterpretation of the statute is the only one consistent with the\n\npurposes and legislative history of the Act.              Thus, the State\n\nargues that because the statute is unambiguous, deference to the\n\nSecretary is unwarranted. In any event, the State argues that even\n\nif deference might have been warranted, the Secretary's current\n\ninterpretation is not entitled to deference because it contradicts\n\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fthe Secretary's practice in the more than seventy years since the\n\npassage of the IRA.\n\n            1.      Chevron Analysis\n\n            The Secretary has offered an interpretation of the IRA\n\nthat permits trust acquisitions for tribes recognized and under\n\nfederal   jurisdiction       at   the    time   the     request    for     a    trust\n\nacquisition is made.       A court reviewing an agency's interpretation\n\nof a statute that it administers engages in a two-step analysis.\n\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S.\n\n837, 842-43 (1984).        We must first consider \"whether Congress has\n\ndirectly spoken to the precise question at issue.\"                Id. at 842.       If\n\ncongressional     intent    is    clear,   we   \"must    give     effect       to   the\n\nunambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\" Id. at 842-43. \"[I]f\n\nthe statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific\n\nissue,\"     however,   we     must      consider      \"whether     the     agency's\n\n[interpretation] is based on a permissible construction of the\n\nstatute.\"    Id. at 843.\n\n            (a)   Whether Section 479 Is Ambiguous\n\n            We begin our analysis with the statutory text. Rucker v.\n\nLee Holding Co., 471 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 2006).                  The language at\n\nissue is that contained in 25 U.S.C. § 479, which provides:\n\n            The term \"Indian\" as used in this Act shall\n            include all persons of Indian descent who are\n            members of any recognized Indian tribe now\n            under Federal jurisdiction, and all persons\n            who are descendants of such members who were,\n            on June 1, 1934, residing within the present\n\n                                        -18-\n\f             boundaries of any Indian reservation, and\n             shall further include all other persons of\n             one-half or more Indian blood.\n\nOne might have an initial instinct to read the word \"now\" in the\n\nstatute as the State does, to mean the date of enactment of the\n\nstatute, June 18, 1934. Congress certainly has used the word \"now\"\n\nin this way.       See, e.g., Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U.S. 308, 312\n\n(1961) (interpreting the word \"now\" in a reenactment of an earlier\n\nact to refer to the initial date of enactment).\n\n             Any   such   instinct   quickly    disappears    upon   further\n\nexamination, however.        This is not a case that can be resolved by\n\nlooking to the plain meaning of the term \"now\" standing by itself.\n\n\"Now\" means \"at the present time,\" but there is ambiguity as to\n\nwhether to view the term \"now\" as operating at the moment Congress\n\nenacted it or at the moment the Secretary invokes it.                 Indeed,\n\nCongress sometimes uses the word \"now\" to refer to a time other\n\nthan the moment of enactment.           See Difford v. Sec'y of Health &\n\nHuman Servs., 910 F.2d 1316, 1320 (6th Cir. 1990) (interpreting the\n\nword \"now\" in a disability benefits termination provision to refer\n\nto the time of the hearing); see also Pierce v. Pierce, 287 N.W.2d\n\n879,   882   (Iowa   1980)    (noting   that   the   phrase   \"now   hav[ing]\n\njurisdiction\" in the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act \"refers\n\nto the time of the filing of the petition\"); cf. Williams v.\n\nRagland, 567 So. 2d 63, 65-66 (La. 1990) (declining to interpret\n\n\"now serving\" in a mandatory judicial retirement provision to refer\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fto the date of enactment).       There also are other layers of\n\nambiguity.\n\n           Given that the word \"now\" does not itself have a clear\n\nmeaning, we must look to context.   Here, the context is equivocal.\n\nOn the one hand, the State points to 25 U.S.C. § 472, another\n\nprovision of the IRA, which refers to \"positions maintained, now or\n\nhereafter, by the Indian Office.\"     The State argues that this use\n\nof \"now\" unambiguously refers to the date of enactment and that had\n\nCongress wanted to include later-recognized tribes in section 479,\n\nit would have similarly added the words \"or hereafter.\"\n\n           On the other hand, the Secretary points out that section\n\n479 itself specifies the date of \"June 1, 1934\" as the relevant\n\ndate for determining eligibility based on \"residing within the\n\npresent boundaries of any Indian reservation.\"    The Secretary thus\n\ncounters that had Congress wanted to require recognition of a tribe\n\non the date of enactment, it would have specified that date, rather\n\nthan using the term \"now.\"    See also 25 U.S.C. § 478 (requiring\n\nelections to be held \"within one year after June 18, 1934\").\n\nHence, \"now\" might mean \"now or hereafter\" or it might mean \"June\n\n18, 1934\"; either would be consistent with some other part of the\n\nstatute.\n\n           Policy does not provide an obvious answer either: each\n\nside has a plausible explanation that policy considerations favor\n\nits interpretation.   The State argues that the principal, perhaps\n\n\n                               -20-\n\fexclusive, concern of the 1934 statute was with remedying the\n\nperceived ills of the prior practice of allotment. See Kahawaiolaa\n\nv. Norton, 222 F. Supp. 2d 1213, 1220 n.10 (D. Haw. 2002).                      Because\n\nthe IRA ended allotments in 1934, see 25 U.S.C. § 461, they would\n\nnot have affected later-recognized tribes, and hence there would\n\nhave been no reason to include such tribes within the ambit of the\n\nstatute.\n\n            The Secretary takes the view that the Act was intended\n\nnot only to remedy past wrongs, but also to set a template for the\n\nfuture that would encourage the strength and stability of tribal\n\ncommunities.      Based on this view, it would make no sense to\n\ndistinguish among tribes based on the happenstance of their federal\n\nrecognition status in 1934.              The Secretary's view is buttressed by\n\nthe fact that the Act contains a number of provisions that have\n\nnothing to do with land consolidation.                       See id. § 472 (Indian\n\nemployment preference); id. § 476 (tribal organization).\n\n            The State reads United States v. John, 437 U.S. 634\n\n(1978),    to   indicate      that       the   Supreme    Court    had    an    initial\n\ninterpretation     of    the       Act    that     coincides     with    the    State's\n\ninterpretation.         It    is    unclear       if   the    Court     had    any    such\n\ninterpretation,    and       in    any    event,    we   find    that    John    is   not\n\ncontrolling here.       In John, the Fifth Circuit had found that the\n\nMississippi Choctaws were not eligible for benefits under the IRA\n\nbecause the tribe had not been recognized in 1934.                      United States\n\n\n                                           -21-\n\fv. John, 560 F.2d 1202, 1212 (5th Cir. 1977); see also United\n\nStates v. Miss. Tax Comm'n, 505 F.2d 633, 642 (5th Cir. 1974).   The\n\nSupreme Court reversed, relying on a different clause in the\n\nstatute and finding the tribe eligible for benefits under the IRA,\n\nbut on the basis that its members were \"persons of one-half or more\n\nIndian blood.\"   437 U.S. at 650.\n\n          Along the way, the Supreme Court stated:\n\n          The 1934 Act defined \"Indians\" not only as\n          \"all persons of Indian descent who are members\n          of any recognized [in 1934] tribe now under\n          Federal jurisdiction,\" and their descendants\n          who   then  were   residing   on  any   Indian\n          reservation, but also as \"all other persons of\n          one-half or more Indian blood.\"\n\nId. (alteration in original) (quoting 25 U.S.C. § 479 (1976)). The\n\nbracketed addition may be read to support the State's position, but\n\nthe opinion contains no analysis on this point, and the Court\n\nrested its holding on an entirely separate provision of the Act,\n\none not at issue here.    We are mindful that the Supreme Court's\n\nmusings may warrant our attention.     See Rossiter v. Potter, 357\n\nF.3d 26, 31 n.3 (1st Cir. 2004); but see P. Leval, Judging Under\n\nthe Constitution: Dicta About Dicta, 81 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1249 (2006).\n\nIn this case, however, given John's complete lack of analysis of\n\nthe provision that concerns us, the relevant language seems to us\n\nto fall short even of being dicta.\n\n          Having found both text and context to be ambiguous, we\n\nturn to legislative history.   Despite the State's arguments to the\n\n\n                                -22-\n\fcontrary, that history also does not clearly resolve the issue.\n\nIndeed, it suggests a reading of the phrase \"now under federal\n\njurisdiction\" different from that offered by any of the parties,\n\nand is thus another source of ambiguity.\n\n          The congressional record establishes that the phrase \"now\n\nunder federal jurisdiction\" was specifically added to the statutory\n\ndefinition of \"Indian,\" a term defined separately from \"tribe.\"\n\nSee 25 U.S.C. § 479. The phrase was suggested by then-Commissioner\n\nof Indian Affairs John Collier in response to the concern that not\n\nall self-identified Indians deserved to benefit from the Act:\n\n          The Chairman. But the thing about it is this,\n          Senator; I think you have to sooner or later\n          eliminate those Indians who are at the present\n          time -- as I said the other day, you have a\n          tribe of Indians here, for instance in\n          northern   California,    several    so-called\n          \"tribes\" there. They are no more Indians than\n          you or I, perhaps.     I mean they are white\n          people essentially.   And yet they are under\n          the supervision of the Government of the\n          United States, and there is no reason for it\n          at all, in my judgment. Their lands ought to\n          be turned over to them in severalty and\n          divided up and let them go ahead and operate\n          their own property in their own way.\n\n          Senator O'Mahoney.    If I may suggest, that\n          could be handled by some separate provision\n          excluding from the benefits of the act certain\n          types, but must have a general definition.\n\n          Commissioner Collier.    Would this not meet\n          your thought, Senator:       After the words\n          \"recognized Indian tribe\" in line 1 insert\n          \"now under Federal jurisdiction\"? That would\n          limit the act to the Indians now under Federal\n          jurisdiction, except that other Indians of\n\n\n                               -23-\n\f            more than          one-half     Indian      blood   would    get\n            help.\n\nTo Grant to Indians Living Under Federal Tutelage the Freedom To\n\nOrganize    for    Purposes        of   Local      Self-Government       and     Economic\n\nEnterprise: Hearing on S.2755 and S.3645 Before the S. Comm. on\n\nIndian Affairs, 73d Cong. 266 (1934).\n\n            Commissioner Collier offered the phrase as a limitation,\n\nbut   it   is    not     clear    whether    it    was    intended      as   a   temporal\n\nlimitation. If the committee was concerned about the bona fides of\n\nan individual's status as an Indian and wanted to use the fact of\n\nfederal jurisdiction to measure those bona fides, then there would\n\nhave been no reason to distinguish between those under federal\n\njurisdiction      in     1934    and    those     who   later   came    under     federal\n\njurisdiction. In fact, the colloquy quoted above suggests that the\n\ncommittee       sought    to     exclude    some    Indians     already      \"under   the\n\nsupervision of the Government of the United States.\"                              If the\n\npurpose was to exclude those who might later be dropped from\n\nfederal jurisdiction, it would make more sense to measure status as\n\nof the date benefits were sought, not as of the date of enactment\n\nof the statute.\n\n            Indeed, the colloquy and the remainder of the hearing\n\nsuggest that the committee was focused on the issue of individual\n\nIndians who received benefits from the federal government on the\n\nbasis of a limited heritage and without acting as a part of a\n\ntribal community.         Earlier in the session, the chairman had raised\n\n                                           -24-\n\fthe case of a \"former Vice President of the United States,\" who was\n\napparently receiving Indian benefits, asking, \"Why should the\n\nGovernment of the United States be managing the property of a lot\n\nof Indians who are practically white and hold office and do\n\neverything else, but in order to evade taxes or in order to do\n\nsomething else they come in under the Government supervision and\n\ncontrol?\"   Id. at 264.\n\n            Thus, although none of the parties have raised this, it\n\nmay well be that the phrase \"now under federal jurisdiction\" was\n\nintended to modify not \"recognized Indian tribe,\" but rather \"all\n\npersons of Indian descent.\"     So interpreted, the purpose of the\n\nphrase might well have been to grandfather in those individuals\n\nalready receiving federal benefits, but to otherwise insist that in\n\nthe future, only individuals with at least one-half Indian blood\n\nwould qualify.   In that case, the limitation may well have been a\n\ntemporal one, but the limitation, temporal or not, may have been\n\nintended to affect only the Secretary's authority to act for the\n\nbenefit of an \"individual Indian,\" not an \"Indian tribe.\"     See 25\n\nU.S.C. § 465 (\"Title to any lands or rights acquired pursuant to\n\nthis Act . . . shall be taken in the name of the United States in\n\ntrust for the Indian tribe or individual Indian for which the land\n\nis acquired . . . .\"   (emphasis added)).   After all, while Congress\n\nmay have been concerned about misdirecting resources to individuals\n\nwho were only Indians in name, the same concern would not apply to\n\n\n                                -25-\n\ffederally recognized tribes, regardless of the date of federal\n\nrecognition. In any event, this piece of legislative history amply\n\nsupports the view that the statute is at least ambiguous and leaves\n\nroom for administrative interpretation.\n\n           The other relevant piece of legislative history, heavily\n\nrelied upon by the State, is the statement of Representative Edgar\n\nHoward, a cosponsor of the IRA:\n\n           For purposes of this act, [the definitional\n           section] defines the persons who shall be\n           classed as Indian. In essence, it recognizes\n           the status quo of the present reservation\n           Indians and further includes all other persons\n           of one-fourth Indian blood. The latter\n           provision is intended to prevent persons of\n           less than one-fourth Indian blood who are\n           already enrolled members of a tribe or\n           descendants of such members living on a\n           reservation from claiming financial and other\n           benefits of the act. Obviously the line must\n           be drawn somewhere . . .\n\nKahawaiolaa, 222 F. Supp. 2d at 1220 n.10 (emphasis omitted)\n\n(quoting Congressional Debate on Wheeler-Howard Bill (1934) in III\n\nThe   American   Indian   and    the    United   States   (1973))   (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n           The State interprets the reference to \"status quo\" as\n\nsupporting   its   view   that    federal     recognition    of   tribes   was\n\nessentially frozen for purposes of the IRA in 1934.           This seems to\n\nbe a misinterpretation of the quote, however.                Representative\n\nHoward did not say that the Act would \"maintain\" or \"preserve\" the\n\nstatus quo; rather he stated that the Act would \"recognize\" it.\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fMoreover,    the   quote   refers   not    to   Indian   tribes,   but     to\n\n\"reservation Indians.\"      Thus, in context, this sentence is more\n\nlikely a reference to that portion of the definition of an Indian,\n\nnot at issue here, that covers \"all persons who are descendants of\n\nsuch members who were, on June 1, 1934, residing within the present\n\nboundaries of any Indian reservation.\"          25 U.S.C. § 479.         This\n\nprovision, with its explicit reference to 1934, covered those\n\npeople of Indian descent then living on a reservation, without\n\nregard to whether they might independently qualify as Indians under\n\nthe Act.    In that sense, the definition accepted and \"recognized\"\n\nthe status quo of the reservations.\n\n            Thus, we find from the text, context, and legislative\n\nhistory that section 479 is at least ambiguous as to whether the\n\nphrase \"now under federal jurisdiction\" disqualifies tribes that\n\nwere federally recognized after 1934, such as the Narragansett\n\nTribe, from the benefits of the IRA.7\n\n\n     7\n          We reject two additional arguments offered by the State.\nFirst, it is not significant that 25 U.S.C. § 478 required tribes\nto opt out of the IRA by a fixed date, rather than one that\ndepended on the date of recognition. In general, it is difficult\nto see why any tribe would opt out of a statute designed to benefit\nit, and the legislative history suggests that the provision was a\nlegacy from earlier drafts of the bill that imposed duties on\ntribes in return for the benefits.      See Hearing on S.2755 and\nS.3645, supra, at 262. As eventually passed, the only potential\npurpose of the election was to protect the rights of those that\npreferred the allotment system, an issue not relevant to tribes\nrecognized after 1934.\n          Second, we hesitate to attach much weight to the fact\nthat later Congresses have explicitly provided for the IRA to apply\nto newly recognized tribes.     As the Supreme Court has recently\n\n                                    -27-\n\f          (b)        Whether   the     Secretary's      Interpretation      Is\n                     Permissible\n\n          As we have found the meaning of section 479 to be\n\nambiguous, we must consider whether the Secretary's interpretation\n\nis \"permissible.\"     Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843.        An interpretation is\n\npermissible if it is \"rational and consistent with the statute.\"\n\nNLRB v. United Food & Commercial Workers Union, Local 23, 484 U.S.\n\n112, 123 (1987). The Secretary's construction meets this test. As\n\ndiscussed above, it is reasonable and is consistent with the\n\nlanguage and legislative history of the IRA. It also is consistent\n\nwith the policy of the IRA, which, as we have indicated, may\n\npermissibly    be   viewed   not   only     as   intending   to   reverse   the\n\ngovernment's allotment policy, but also as affirmatively conferring\n\nbenefits on Indians, including Indian employment preferences and a\n\nstatutory right to organize and adopt governing documents.\n\n          We therefore reject the State's argument that the text\n\nand purposes of the IRA prohibit the Secretary's interpretation of\n\nsection 479.    Rather, we find that the Secretary's construction of\n\nsection 479 as allowing trust acquisitions for tribes that are\n\n\n\n\ncautioned again, the views of later Congresses carry little weight\nin determining the intent of the Congress that enacted the statute\nin question. See Massachusetts v. EPA, 127 S. Ct. 1438, 1460 &\nn.27 (2007). For the same reason, we do not take later enactments\nsuch as the 1994 amendments to section 476 to establish that\nCongress intended to make no distinctions among tribes in 1934.\nThe parties have not pointed us to contemporaneous legislation that\nsheds further light on the issue.\n\n                                     -28-\n\frecognized and under federal jurisdiction at the time of the trust\n\napplication is entitled to deference.\n\n          2.       Alleged   Inconsistency      of      the   Secretary's\n                   Interpretation\n\n          The State makes a separate argument on which it heavily\n\nrelies.   It argues that the Secretary's interpretation of section\n\n479 to allow trust acquisitions for tribes not federally recognized\n\nin 1934 represents a change in position as to the eligibility of\n\ntribes for IRA benefits, and that this interpretation therefore is\n\nnot entitled to deference.         The State relies particularly on\n\nhistorical practice, and says that the Secretary has never, or at\n\nleast has hardly ever, identified as IRA-eligible a tribal entity\n\nthat was not federally recognized in 1934 and does not meet the\n\nhalf-blood test.   The evidence is limited with respect to whether\n\nthe Secretary's interpretation of section 479 of the IRA has been\n\nconsistent over the past seventy-three years.8\n\n          The   consistency   of   the    Secretary's    construction   is\n\nsupported, though not directly, by a regulation promulgated by the\n\nSecretary in 1980.    The regulation, found at 25 C.F.R. § 151.2,\n\nsets forth definitions that pertain to the regulations governing\n\ntrust acquisitions.   25 C.F.R. § 151.2(b) defines a tribe that may\n\nbe eligible for a trust acquisition as \"any Indian tribe, band,\n\n\n\n     8\n          One difficulty arises from the fact that there seems to\nbe no comprehensive list of tribes that were recognized and under\nfederal jurisdiction as of June 18, 1934.\n\n                                   -29-\n\fnation, pueblo, community, rancheria, colony, or other group of\n\nIndians . . . which is recognized by the Secretary as eligible for\n\nthe   special     programs    and     services    from   the    Bureau    of   Indian\n\nAffairs.\"       The regulation does not distinguish between tribes\n\nrecognized before June 18, 1934 and those recognized thereafter.\n\nRather, it suggests that whether or not a group of Indians is\n\nconsidered a tribe, and therefore may be eligible to have land\n\ntaken into trust, turns on a tribe's federal recognition status at\n\nthe time a trust acquisition is requested.\n\n               Moreover, the Secretary's proffered interpretation of\n\n\"now\"     as    meaning      \"today\"     is     consistent      with     regulations\n\nimplementing other provisions of the IRA.9                      For example, the\n\nregulation      implementing     25    U.S.C.    §   466,      which   directs   the\n\nSecretary to regulate the operation and management of Indian\n\nforestry units,      states that it applies to \"any Indian tribe . . .\n\nwhich is recognized as eligible for the special programs and\n\nservices provided by the United States to Indians because of their\n\nstatus as Indians.\"       25 C.F.R. § 163.1.         Similarly, the regulation\n\n\n\n      9\n          The Secretary's interpretation also is consistent with\nregulations interpreting and implementing other federal statutes\nestablishing Indian programs and services.       For example, the\napplicability of the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1901-\n1963, the applicability of minimum standards for basic education of\nIndian children in schools operated by the BIA, id. § 2001, and\neligibility for Indian financial assistance and social services\nprograms, id. § 13, all are defined in terms of current federal\nrecognition. See 25 C.F.R. § 23.2; id. § 36.3; id. § 20.100.\n\n                                        -30-\n\fimplementing 25 U.S.C. § 476, which allows eligible Indian tribes\n\nto organize and adopt constitutions and bylaws, defines eligibility\n\nin current terms: all Indian entities that have not voted to\n\nexclude themselves from the IRA and that are \"included, or [are]\n\neligible to be included, among those tribes . . . recognized and\n\nreceiving services from the [BIA]\" are eligible to organize under\n\nsection 476.    25 C.F.R. § 81.1.\n\n           As to the Secretary's trust acquisition practice, it is\n\nnot seriously disputed that the Secretary has never rejected an\n\napplication to take land into trust for a federally recognized\n\ntribe on the ground that the tribe was not recognized and under\n\nfederal   jurisdiction     in   1934.      Responding    to    the   State's\n\nallegations about whose trust acquisition applications have been\n\ngranted, the Secretary and Indian amici have submitted to us lists\n\nof tribes that they assert were not federally recognized in 1934\n\nfor whom land has since been taken into trust.          The State disputes\n\nthis evidence, arguing that nearly all of the identified tribes\n\neither have no trust lands, are not \"newly recognized\" because they\n\nwere   under   federal    jurisdiction     in   1934,   or    have   obtained\n\nlegislation     from     Congress    specifically       permitting      trust\n\nacquisitions on their behalf.\n\n           The State's evidence of inconsistent practice is not\n\npersuasive.    For example, although the State seems to concede that\n\nthe Miccosukee Tribe was not recognized in 1934, it argues that the\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\flater trust acquisition for that tribe identified by Indian amici\n\nwas made pursuant to specific statutory authorization, not section\n\n465.   But the statute to which the State points us, 25 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1741-1750e, does not itself authorize acquisition of the parcel\n\nidentified by Indian amici.         Rather, it authorizes acquisition of\n\na different parcel.      Indeed, in taking the parcel identified by\n\nIndian amici into trust, the Secretary explicitly relied on his\n\nauthority under section 465.\n\n          Turning to a different distinction, the State argues that\n\neight of the tribes identified by Indian amici were recognized and\n\nunder federal jurisdiction in 1934 because they previously had\n\nsigned treaties with the United States.           It is not self-evident\n\nthat simply because a tribe had signed a treaty with the U.S.\n\ngovernment   it   necessarily       was   recognized   and   under    federal\n\njurisdiction in 1934; recognition as intended in section 479\n\nrequires an ongoing government-to-government relationship between\n\na tribe and the United States.            See Cohen's Handbook of Federal\n\nIndian Law § 3.02(3), at 138-40 (N.J. Newton et al., eds 2005).\n\n          Whether   or   not    a    treaty    executed   before     1934   has\n\nsignificance, however, the evidence is still that the Secretary has\n\ntaken land into trust for tribes that did not appear to be\n\nfederally recognized in 1934. We note two examples. The Secretary\n\nhas taken land into trust for the Sault Ste. Marie Band of Chippewa\n\nIndians despite the Secretary's position that, regardless of prior\n\n\n                                     -32-\n\ftreaties, the Band was not federally recognized in 1934. The Sault\n\nSte. Marie Band is a successor to some of the Chippewa tribes that\n\nhad signed treaties with the United States between 1785 and 1855.\n\nIn addition, in 1855 the Band had signed two treaties with the\n\nUnited States.    Despite those treaties, however, by 1917 the\n\nDepartment of the Interior did not recognize the Band as an entity\n\nwith which it had government-to-government relations.   Opinion of\n\nNat’l Indian Gaming Comm’n, The St. Ignace Parcel at 7 (July 31,\n\n2006); see also City of Sault Ste. Marie v. Andrus, 532 F. Supp.\n\n157, 161 (D.D.C. 1980) (indicating that a period of non-recognition\n\nexisted by stating that \"although the question of whether some\n\ngroups qualified as Indian tribes for purposes of IRA benefits\n\nmight have been unclear in 1934, that fact does not preclude the\n\nSecretary from subsequently determining that a given tribe deserved\n\nrecognition in 1934\").   The State rejoins that the Department of\n\nthe Interior cannot abrogate an Indian treaty. But the validity of\n\nthe Department’s treatment of the Sault Ste. Marie Band's status\n\nunder the treaties is not the issue before us.   What is important\n\nis the Department's position that the Band was not recognized and\n\nunder federal jurisdiction in 1934.    Id. at 16.    Nevertheless,\n\nafter 1934, the Secretary has invoked his section 465 authority to\n\ntake land into trust for the Band.\n\n          The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians\n\nprovides a similar example.    The Secretary has taken land into\n\n                               -33-\n\ftrust for the Grand Traverse Band, which the Department of the\n\nInterior ceased to recognize in 1872.      The Grand Traverse Band\n\nsigned the 1855 Treaty of Detroit with the United States.   In 1872,\n\nhowever, the then-Secretary of the Interior severed the United\n\nStates’ relationship with the Band and ceased to treat the Band as\n\na federally recognized tribe.     Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa &\n\nChippewa Indians v. U.S. Attorney for the W. Dist. of Mich., 369\n\nF.3d 960, 961 (6th Cir. 2004); see also Grand Traverse Band of\n\nOttawa & Chippewa Indians v. U.S. Attorney for the W. Dist. of\n\nMich., 198 F. Supp. 2d 920, 924 (W.D. Mich. 2002) (\"Between 1872\n\nand 1980, the Band continually sought to regain its status as a\n\nfederally recognized tribe.\").    Yet, the Secretary has invoked his\n\nauthority under section 465 to take twenty-one parcels of land into\n\ntrust for the Band.10\n\n\n     10\n          Indian amici also submitted opinions of the Solicitor of\nthe Department of the Interior discussing various tribes’\neligibility to organize under the IRA as evidence that the\nSecretary has consistently interpreted “now” in section 479 to mean\n“today.”   The State’s attempt to distinguish these opinions is\nunsuccessful. For example, in discussing the IRA eligibility of\nthe St. Croix Indians of Wisconsin, the Solicitor makes no mention\nwhatsoever of the tribe’s status as of 1934. Solicitor’s Opinion,\nJan. 29, 1941, 1 Op. Sol. on Indian Affairs 1026 (1979). The State\nargues that it is clear from context that the tribe was not\nrecognized as of 1934. Yet, although this is true, the Solicitor\ndiscusses the fact that the tribe has never had a separate tribal\nstatus, and that until it does so, only those Indians who meet the\nhalf-blood test are eligible to organize under the IRA. Id. at\n1027. Moreover, contrary to the State’s position, the Solicitor’s\nopinion indicates that if the tribe takes certain steps, it may\nlater become eligible to organize under the IRA as a recognized\nband. Id.\n          Similarly, in discussing the Nahma and Beaver Island\n\n                                 -34-\n\f             The State also concedes that the Secretary appears to\n\nhave taken land into trust for two tribes, the Tunica-Biloxi Indian\n\nTribe and the Narragansetts themselves, that were not under federal\n\njurisdiction in 1934 and for whom Congress has passed no specific\n\nact authorizing trust acquisitions.          Even if we had no reason to\n\ndoubt the State's argument that the Secretary has not historically\n\ntaken land into trust for tribes not recognized in 1934, however,\n\nin at least some cases the Secretary has not looked to the status\n\nof the tribe in 1934 or to the specific statutory authority\n\nidentified by the State in making the determination to take land\n\ninto trust.      In Baker v. Muskogee Area Dir., 19 I.B.I.A. 164\n\n(1991), for example, the IBIA, in concluding that particular\n\nmembers of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma were eligible to have\n\nland taken into trust, did not rely on the 1936 Oklahoma Indian\n\nWelfare Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 501-570, which authorized the Secretary\n\nto take land into trust for Indians in Oklahoma.          Rather, the IBIA\n\nstated that the Indians \"c[a]me within the IRA definition because\n\nthey   are   members   of   a   recognized   Indian   tribe   under   Federal\n\n\nIndians’ eligibility to organize under the IRA, the Solicitor\ndiscusses the tribe’s historical status, but then continues to\ndiscuss its then-current situation. Solicitor’s Opinion, May 31,\n1937, 1 Op. Sol. on Indian Affairs 747, 747-48 (1979).      If the\nSolicitor had been concerned only with the tribe’s status as of\n1934, there would have been no reason for him to have considered\nthe \"recent . . . attitude of the Interior Department on the band\nstatus\" of the Nahma and Beaver Indians, nor for him to state that\nit was \"out of the question to establish any existing band status\"\nbefore concluding that the Indians were eligible for organization\nonly under the IRA's half-blood provision. Id. at 748.\n\n                                     -35-\n\fjurisdiction.\"    19 I.B.I.A. at 179.   The Secretary thus seems to\n\nhave intended to exercise his section 465 authority to take land\n\ninto trust on the basis of current federal recognition.\n\n          The State has not met its burden of showing inconsistent\n\ninterpretation by the Secretary.    Moreover, even if the State had\n\nshown that the Secretary has changed his interpretation of section\n\n479 over time, that would not necessarily resolve the matter in the\n\nState's favor.     The Chevron doctrine permits the Secretary some\n\nability to alter his interpretation over time.    See Nat'l Cable &\n\nTelecomms. Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 967, 981-82\n\n(2005) (under Chevron, an agency should have flexibility to vary\n\nits interpretation of a statute over time).       The Secretary has\n\ngiven a reasoned explanation for his interpretation.\n\n          We reject the State's argument that the Secretary has\n\nbeen inconsistent in his interpretation of section 479 and is\n\ntherefore not entitled to deference.\n\nC.        The Settlement Act\n\n          The State's next attack is to argue that the Settlement\n\nAct repealed the Secretary's trust authority as to all lands in\n\nRhode Island.    Alternatively, the State argues that the Settlement\n\nAct at least curtailed that authority so that any trust must\n\npreserve the State's civil and criminal jurisdiction over the\n\nParcel.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -36-\n\f             There is simply nothing in the text of the Settlement\n\nAct, however, that accomplishes such a repeal or curtailment of the\n\nSecretary's trust authority.    25 U.S.C. § 1708(a) provides:\n\n             Except as otherwise provided in this [Act],\n             the settlement lands shall be subject to the\n             civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of\n             the State of Rhode Island.\n\n(emphasis added).     The State would have us read the Act as if\n\nsection 1708(a) applied to all lands the Tribe might ever acquire,\n\neither directly or as the beneficiary of a trust, but that is not\n\nwhat the section says. By its terms, section 1708(a) applies state\n\nlaw only to the 1800 acres of \"settlement lands.\"     The Parcel is\n\nnot part of the settlement lands.       No other provision of the\n\nSettlement Act directly provides for state jurisdiction outside of\n\nthe settlement lands.    No language in the Act applies state law to\n\nlands the Tribe might later acquire. More importantly, no language\n\nexplicitly curtails, or even references, the Secretary's power\n\nunder the IRA to take lands into trust and thereby to create Indian\n\ncountry.11\n\n\n\n     11\n          Nor is this case controlled by our en banc decision in\nNarragansett III.   That case concerned the State's jurisdiction\nover the settlement lands, see 449 F.3d at 20, and has no bearing\non whether the Settlement Act abrogates the Secretary's trust\nauthority outside of the settlement lands.        Similarly, cases\nholding that section 1708(a) survived federal recognition and the\nconveyance of the settlement lands to federal trust are of no help\nto the State, since section 1708(a) refers only to the settlement\nlands.   See Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Nat'l Indian Gaming\nComm'n, 158 F.3d 1335, 1341-42 (D.C. Cir. 1998); Narragansett I, 19\nF.3d at 694-95.\n\n                                 -37-\n\f               The State's argument thus depends on finding that the\n\nSettlement Act implicitly repealed the IRA, at least in part.12 The\n\nframework for evaluating such a claim of implicit repeal was set\n\nout by the Supreme Court in Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535 (1974).\n\nFirst, we must look to affirmative manifestations of congressional\n\nintent to repeal the prior act, mindful of the \"cardinal rule . . .\n\nthat repeals by implication are not favored.\" Id. at 549 (omission\n\nin original) (quoting Posadas v. Nat'l City Bank of N.Y., 296 U.S.\n\n497, 503 (1936)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                     \"In the\n\nabsence of some affirmative showing of an intention to repeal, the\n\nonly        permissible    justification       for   [finding]     a   repeal    by\n\nimplication       is   [that]    the    earlier      and   later   statutes     are\n\nirreconcilable.\"          Id. at 550.   Such a conflict is not lightly to be\n\nfound.       \"[A]bsent a clearly expressed congressional intention to\n\nthe contrary,\" we must \"give effect to both [acts] if possible.\"\n\nId. at 551 (quoting United States v. Borden Co., 308 U.S. 188, 198\n\n(1939)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n               A determination of congressional intent must be rooted in\n\nthe text of the Act.          Nothing in the Act explicitly curtails the\n\n\n       12\n          The State adds nothing to its argument by also styling it\nas an issue of claim preclusion. Obviously, the earlier litigation\nthat resulted in the Settlement Act could not have resolved the\nquestion raised in this case of whether the Settlement Act\nrestricts the Secretary's trust authority under the IRA.         By\ninvoking \"principles of res judicata,\" the State means nothing more\nthan that the Tribe should be held to the settlement to which it\npreviously agreed.    What precisely the Tribe agreed to in the\nsettlement is, of course, the question we are addressing.\n\n                                        -38-\n\fSecretary's trust authority.       The State offers two different lines\n\nof argument as to why provisions of the Act must be read to\n\nrestrict that authority.         One concerns how the Act affects the\n\nTribe's   rights;   the   other    concerns    how   the    Act   affects   the\n\nSecretary's authority.      The provisions of the Settlement Act cited\n\nby the State, however, are most naturally read as merely resolving\n\nthe claims that had clouded the titles of so much land in Rhode\n\nIsland and that had led to the settlement embodied in the Act.\n\n           As to the provisions affecting the Tribe, the State\n\nrelies independently on the extinguishment of aboriginal title in\n\n25   U.S.C.    §§   1705(a)(2)     and     1712(a)(2)      and    the   further\n\nextinguishment in sections 1705(a)(3) and 1712(a)(3) of \"all claims\n\n. . . based upon any interest in or right involving\" certain land\n\nor   natural   resources.         These    provisions,      however,    follow\n\nsections 1705(a)(1) and 1712(a)(1), respectively, which validate\n\n\"any transfer of land or natural resources\" in the United States by\n\nthe Narragansett Tribe or in Rhode Island by any Indian tribe \"as\n\nof the date of said transfer.\"13           The provisions then go on to\n\nstate:\n\n           (2) [T]o the extent that any transfer of land\n           or natural resources described in subsection\n           (a) of this section may involve land or\n\n\n     13\n          Section 1705 applies to the Narragansett Tribe and any\nland in Charlestown, Rhode Island. Section 1712 applies to land\nelsewhere in Rhode Island transferred by other Indian tribes. The\nrelevant provisions in each are materially the same for our\npurposes here.\n\n                                    -39-\n\f          natural resources to which [an Indian tribe]\n          had aboriginal title, subsection (a) of this\n          section shall be regarded as an extinguishment\n          of such aboriginal title as of the date of\n          said transfer; and\n\n          (3) by virtue of the approval of a transfer of\n          land or natural resources effected by this\n          section, or an extinguishment of aboriginal\n          title effected thereby, all claims . . . by\n          the [Narragansett Tribe], or any predecessor\n          or   successor   in    interest,   member   or\n          stockholder thereof, or any other Indian,\n          Indian nation, or tribe of Indians, arising\n          subsequent to the transfer and based upon any\n          interest in or right involving such land or\n          natural resources (including but not limited\n          to claims for trespass damages or claims for\n          use and occupancy) shall be regarded as\n          extinguished as of the date of the transfer.\n\n25 U.S.C. § 1705(a).   Given the references back to the transfers\n\nvalidated in paragraph (1), the evident purpose of these provisions\n\nis to extinguish claims based on the purported invalidity of those\n\ntransfers.\n\n          The State's arguments that the provisions should be read\n\nmore broadly are unavailing.    First, the State argues that the\n\nextinguishment of aboriginal title over land in Rhode Island\n\nprecludes the later exercise of tribal sovereignty over Rhode\n\nIsland land acquired by the Secretary in unrestricted trust.    The\n\nSecretary disputes whether aboriginal title is ever the basis for\n\ntribal sovereignty, but in any event, it is clear that such title\n\nis not the only basis for tribal sovereignty.   This is evident from\n\nthe Supreme Court's decision in City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian\n\nNation, 544 U.S. 197 (2005).   In Sherrill, the Supreme Court both\n\n                               -40-\n\fheld that \"the Tribe [could not] unilaterally revive its ancient\n\nsovereignty, in whole or in part, over the parcels at issue,\" id.\n\nat 202-03, and directed the Oneidas to 25 U.S.C. § 465 as \"the\n\nproper avenue for [the tribe] to reestablish sovereign authority\n\nover   [the    relevant]    territory,\"      id.    at   221.   The    State's\n\nprotestation     that      Sherrill    did    not    involve    a     statutory\n\nextinguishment of aboriginal title is beside the point.                However\n\naboriginal title or ancient sovereignty was lost, the IRA provides\n\nan alternative means of establishing tribal sovereignty over land.\n\n           Trust    acquisition       is     not    incompatible    with   the\n\nextinguishment of aboriginal title. The Mashantucket Pequot Indian\n\nClaims Settlement Act, for example, contains virtually identical\n\nlanguage extinguishing aboriginal title \"to any land or natural\n\nresources the transfer of which was approved and ratified\" by the\n\nAct.   25 U.S.C. § 1753(b).     At the same time, the Act provides that\n\ncertain land and natural resources \"located within the settlement\n\nlands shall be held in trust by the United States for the benefit\n\nof the Tribe,\" id. § 1754(b)(7), and that such lands are \"declared\n\nto be Indian country,\" id. §§ 1752(7), 1755.             It is implausible to\n\nthink that Congress intended the extinguishment of aboriginal title\n\nin the Rhode Island Settlement Act to preclude the taking of land\n\n\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\finto unrestricted trust, but did not intend for identical language\n\nin the Mashantucket Settlement Act to do so.14\n\n            Alternatively, the State argues that the \"all claims\"\n\nlanguage    in   paragraph   (3)   even   more   broadly   forecloses   the\n\nassertion of tribal sovereignty over non-settlement lands. To hold\n\notherwise, says the State, would render that language surplusage.\n\nParagraphs (2) and (3) are complementary, however, not duplicative.\n\nWhile paragraph (2) extinguishes a form of title, paragraph (3)\n\nextinguishes claims.     Moreover, paragraph (3) covers claims based\n\non other forms of title, besides aboriginal title, that the Tribe\n\nmight have held to land in Rhode Island prior to the Settlement\n\nAct.\n\n            The State's broad interpretation of paragraph (3) proves\n\ntoo much.        The State argues that the paragraph precludes an\n\nassertion of tribal sovereignty over any land in Rhode Island.\n\nNothing in the language of the provision, which refers to \"any\n\ninterest in or right involving\" such land, distinguishes between\n\nclaims of sovereignty and traditional property claims. Indeed, the\n\nlatter are explicitly included.       See id. § 1705(a)(3) (\"including\n\nbut not limited to claims for trespass damages or claims for use\n\nand occupancy\").       It would be highly improbable that Congress\n\n\n       14\n          We attach little significance to the fact that the\nMashantucket   Settlement   Act   explicitly   authorizes   trust\nacquisition, while the Rhode Island Settlement Act does not. The\nformer, unlike the latter, granted federal recognition to the\ntribe. See 25 U.S.C. § 1758(a).\n\n                                   -42-\n\fintended to prevent the Tribe from asserting any ownership interest\n\nover land it purchased outside the settlement lands, and it would\n\nbe contradictory as to the settlement lands themselves.                  Thus,\n\nthere is no support for reading this provision as precluding all\n\nfuture assertions of tribal sovereignty over land in Rhode Island.\n\n            Ultimately, this entire line of argument by the State\n\nmisses the point that what is at issue is not what the Tribe may do\n\nin the exercise of its rights, but what the Secretary may do.              The\n\ndisplacement of state law arises from the Secretary's authority and\n\nnot from the Tribe's mere purchase of the land.            See Cass County,\n\nMinn. v. Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, 524 U.S. 103, 113-15\n\n(1998).    In order to prevail on its claim of implied repeal, the\n\nState must show that the Settlement Act repeals the Secretary's\n\nauthority under the IRA.\n\n            As to the implied repeal of the Secretary's power, the\n\nState     first   argues   that   the     Secretary   is    bound   by    the\n\nextinguishment of the Tribe's claims because that extinguishment\n\nbinds the Tribe's \"successor in interest.\" 25 U.S.C. § 1705(a)(2),\n\n(3).    Even if the Secretary is such a \"successor in interest,\"\n\nhowever, those provisions cannot plausibly be read to repeal the\n\nSecretary's power under the IRA to take land into trust.                   The\n\nSecretary's power does not turn on the Tribe's original aboriginal\n\ninterest in the Parcel, before it purchased the land, nor does it\n\n\n\n\n                                   -43-\n\fturn on whether the Secretary is a successor in interest to the\n\nTribe.15\n\n            The State also relies on 25 U.S.C. § 1707(c), which\n\nprovides:\n\n            Upon the discharge of the Secretary's duties\n            under sections 1704, 1705, 1706, and 1707 of\n            this title, the United States shall have no\n            further duties or liabilities under this\n            subchapter   with  respect   to  the   Indian\n            Corporation or its successor, the State\n            Corporation, or the settlement lands. . . .\n\nThe language of this provision, however, cannot be read to have a\n\npreclusive effect or to limit the Secretary's powers in any way.\n\nThe statement that the United States has \"no further duties or\n\nliabilities under this subchapter\" merely delimits the federal\n\ngovernment's obligations in implementing the Settlement Act.\n\n            We reject the State's suggestion that this language\n\nparallels the language in the Mashantucket Settlement Act that the\n\nSecond Circuit found to prohibit certain trust acquisitions.   See\n\nConnecticut ex rel. Blumenthal v. U.S. Dep't of Interior, 228 F.3d\n\n82, 88 (2d Cir. 2000).   The Mashantucket Settlement Act uses very\n\n\n     15\n          We do not accept the State's comparison of the Rhode\nIsland Settlement Act to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act\n(ANCSA), 43 U.S.C. §§ 1601-1629h, and the resulting suggestion that\ntrust acquisition would be as inappropriate in Rhode Island as it\npurportedly would be in Alaska.       ANCSA eliminated previously\nexisting Indian country in Alaska. See Native Vill. of Venetie,\n522 U.S. at 532-34. Even if one might infer from that elimination\nan intent to preclude later trust acquisitions, no such intent can\nbe inferred from the Rhode Island Settlement Act's failure to\naffirmatively establish Indian country for an as-yet unrecognized\ntribe.\n\n                                -44-\n\fdifferent language that provides that \"the United States shall have\n\nno further trust responsibility with respect to [certain] land and\n\nnatural resources\" outside of the settlement lands.                       25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1754(b)(8).     Disclaiming \"trust responsibility\" over land is\n\nnothing   like   disclaiming       \"duties      or    liabilities       under   this\n\nsubchapter.\"\n\n            There is nothing in the text of the Settlement Act that\n\nclearly   indicates     an   intent     to   repeal     the    Secretary's      trust\n\nacquisition    powers    under    the    IRA,    or    that     is    fundamentally\n\ninconsistent with those powers.16             This lack of language is not\n\nbecause either Congress or the parties failed to anticipate that\n\nthe Tribe might later become federally recognized and eligible for\n\nthe benefits of the IRA.       The Settlement Act specifically provides\n\nfor a restraint on alienation of the settlement lands \"if the\n\nSecretary     subsequently       acknowledges         the     existence    of    the\n\nNarragansett Tribe of Indians.\"              Id. § 1707(c).          The underlying\n\nJMOU also explicitly recognized that the Tribe would \"not receive\n\nFederal recognition\" in the implementation of the settlement, but\n\nwould \"have the same right to petition for such recognition . . .\n\nas other groups.\"       JMOU para. 15.\n\n            Had the Act intended to limit the Secretary's trust\n\nauthority in case of federal recognition, it could have done so\n\n\n\n     16\n       The State has not cited any legislative history that might\nlead us to interpret the text differently.\n\n                                      -45-\n\fexplicitly.    It would have been easy to extend the provisions of\n\nsection 1708(a) preserving state sovereignty to cover all lands in\n\nRhode Island owned by or held in trust for the Tribe.              No such\n\nlanguage appears in the Act.        Similarly, as the IBIA also noted,\n\nparagraph 15 of the JMOU would have been \"a logical place for the\n\nparties to set out any restrictions\" on the Secretary's trust\n\nauthority following federal recognition of the Tribe.              Town of\n\nCharlestown, 35 I.B.I.A. at 101. No such restrictions appear. Nor\n\ndoes the Settlement Act contemplate any role for the State to play\n\nin the Secretary's decision whether to take the land into trust.\n\nThis is in contrast to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n\n          In   other   settlement    acts,    Congress   has   specifically\n\ndescribed limits on the Secretary's trust authority.           In the Maine\n\nIndian   Claims   Settlement   Act,        Congress   expressly   precluded\n\napplication of section 465.    25 U.S.C. § 1724(e) (\"Except for the\n\nprovisions of this [Act], the United States shall have no other\n\nauthority to acquire lands or natural resources in trust for the\n\nbenefit of Indians or Indian nations, or tribes, or bands of\n\nIndians in the State of Maine.\").          In the Mashantucket Settlement\n\nAct, Congress precluded the trust acquisition of non-settlement\n\nlands purchased with settlement funds. See Blumenthal, 228 F.3d at\n\n\n\n\n                                    -46-\n\f88. The absence of any restrictions in the Settlement Act supports\n\nour finding that no restrictions were intended.17         See id. at 90.\n\n            The State's fallback position is that the Settlement Act\n\nrequires that this court order the Secretary to honor the intent of\n\nthe bargain it believes is embodied in the Act by putting the\n\nParcel    into   a   restricted   trust,   subject   to   state   laws   and\n\njurisdiction.18      Acknowledging the genuineness of the State's sense\n\nthat its bargain has been upset, we find that the relief it seeks\n\nis not an appropriate exercise of judicial power.\n\n            In the Settlement Act, the State procured at least two\n\nclear benefits: (1) the settling of disputed land claims and (2)\n\nthe application of its civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction to\n\nthe settlement lands.      Beyond that, the State argues that it would\n\nnever have agreed to displacement of state law as to later acquired\n\nparcels if the issue had surfaced during the negotiations.               The\n\n\n\n     17\n          There are also other examples of Congress's imposing\nexplicit conditions on the taking of land into trust, for example,\nby limiting the number of acres of land and the number of acre feet\nof water rights.   See Nevada v. United States, 221 F. Supp. 2d\n1241, 1244 (D. Nev. 2002) (discussing section 103(A) of the Fallon\nPaiute Shoshone Indian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 1990,\nPub. L. No. 101-618, 104 Stat. 3289, 3291).\n     18\n          The Secretary takes the position that he has no authority\nto impose restrictions on land taken into trust under the IRA,\nabsent a statutory directive imposing such restrictions. We do not\nreach this issue. To the extent that the State argues that the\nSettlement Act itself is such a statutory directive requiring a\nrestricted trust, we reject that argument for the same reasons that\nwe found that the Settlement Act does not eliminate trust authority\naltogether.\n\n                                   -47-\n\fState argues that the practical consequences of the unrestricted\n\ntrust leave it in an entirely unsatisfactory position and undermine\n\nthe central bargain.          Rhode Island points out that it is a small,\n\nvery   populous       state   and     that    the   practical    consequences      of\n\nestablishing Indian country for its nearby towns may be far greater\n\nthan they would be in less densely populated areas.\n\n            Even so, we are still bound by the language of the\n\nSettlement Act.         Even viewing the State's argument in contract\n\nterms, it is rare that a court will step in and reform a contract.\n\nSee Broadley v. Mashpee Neck Marina, Inc., 471 F.3d 272, 275 (1st\n\nCir.   2006)    (reversing      the    district     court's     reformation   of    a\n\ncontract).      Our ability to edit, as opposed to interpret, an act of\n\nCongress is no less constrained: only a finding of absurdity, not\n\npresent here, provides the necessary precondition.

Constitutional Claims\n\n            In   support       of   recognition      of   its   state    sovereignty\n\ninterests    under      the     Constitution,     the      State      presents      four\n\narguments.    It argues first that the Indian Commerce Clause, U.S.\n\nConst. art. I, § 8, cl. 3, does not provide the Secretary the\n\nauthority to displace state law within a state's boundaries, and\n\nthat section 465 of the IRA therefore violates the Tenth Amendment.\n\nNext, it argues that the Secretary may not, in any event, displace\n\nstate law without the State's consent, by operation of the Enclave\n\nClause of the Constitution.            Id. art. I, § 8, cl. 17.            The State\n\nfurther   argues     that     the   Secretary's      action     is    barred   by   the\n\nAdmissions Clause, id. art. IV, § 3, cl. 1, which prohibits\n\nformation of new states within the jurisdiction of any other state.\n\nFinally, the State argues that section 465 is an unconstitutional\n\ndelegation of legislative authority.                  We reject all of these\n\narguments.\n\n            1.

Forty-Three Gallons of Whiskey, 93 U.S.\n\n188, 194 (1876) (\"Congress now has the exclusive and absolute power\n\nto regulate commerce with the Indian tribes . . . .\").\n\n          The Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reserves to\n\nthe states those powers not expressly delegated to the federal\n\ngovernment.     The powers delegated to the federal government and\n\nthose reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment are mutually\n\nexclusive.      \"If    a    power    is   delegated   to   Congress   in   the\n\nConstitution,    the       Tenth    Amendment   expressly    disclaims     any\n\nreservation of that power to the States . . . .\"                New York v.\n\nUnited States, 505 U.S. 144, 156 (1992).              Because Congress has\n\nplenary authority to regulate Indian affairs, section 465 of the\n\nIRA does not offend the Tenth Amendment.              Cf. Herrera-Inirio v.\n\nINS, 208 F.3d 299, 307 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"Because Congress possesses\n\nplenary authority over immigration-related matters, it may freely\n\ndisplace or preempt state laws in respect to such matters.\").\n\n          2.          The Enclave Clause\n\n          The Enclave Clause of the Constitution provides that\n\nCongress may \"exercise exclusive legislation . . . over all places\n\n\n                                      -50-\n\fpurchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which\n\nthe same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals,\n\ndockyards, and other needful buildings.\"             U.S. Const. art. I, § 8,\n\ncl. 17.     The Enclave Clause's provision for exclusive federal\n\njurisdiction was intended to ensure that \"places on which the\n\nsecurity of the entire Union may depend\" are not \"in any degree\n\ndependent on a particular member of it.\" Fort Leavenworth R.R. Co.\n\nv. Lowe, 114 U.S. 525, 530 (1885) (quoting The Federalist No. 43\n\n(James Madison)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                  The State\n\nargues    that   \"[p]rimary      federal     jurisdiction      through   federal\n\nsuperintendence    over    the    land   .   .   .   coupled   with   Congress's\n\nexclusive    legislative      authority      over    Indian    matters   .   .   .\n\ncollectively operate to exclude state law [on trust lands].\"                 As a\n\nresult, it argues, trust acquisitions create federal enclaves and\n\ntherefore require state consent.\n\n            We disagree.    First, trust land does not fall within the\n\nplain language of the Enclave Clause.            It is not purchased \"for the\n\nerection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, [or] other\n\nneedful buildings.\"    Rather, it is held in trust for the benefit of\n\nIndians.\n\n            Second, in Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook, 281 U.S. 647\n\n(1930), the Supreme Court offered an Indian reservation as a\n\n\"typical illustration\" of federally owned land that is not a\n\nfederal enclave because state civil and criminal laws may still\n\n\n                                     -51-\n\fhave partial application therein.     Id. at 651.   The Supreme Court\n\nrecently confirmed the reasoning underlying the observation that\n\nIndian lands are not federal enclaves:\n\n          Indians' right to make their own laws and be\n          governed by them does not exclude all state\n          regulatory authority on the reservation.\n          State   sovereignty   does   not  end   at   a\n          reservation's border. Though tribes are often\n          referred to as \"sovereign\" entities, it was\n          \"long ago\" that \"the Court departed from Chief\n          Justice Marshall's view that 'the laws of [a\n          State] can have no force' within reservation\n          boundaries.\"\n\nHicks, 533 U.S. at 361 (alteration in original) (quoting White\n\nMountain Apache Tribe, 448 U.S. at 141 (quoting Worcester v.\n\nGeorgia, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515, 561 (1832))).        As a result, the\n\nSecretary's trust acquisition of lands for the Narragansetts does\n\nnot even implicate the Enclave Clause.\n\n          3.     The Admissions Clause\n\n          The Admissions Clause of the Constitution provides that\n\n\"no new state shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of\n\nany other state; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or\n\nmore states, or parts of states, without the consent of the\n\nlegislatures of the states concerned as well as of the Congress.\"\n\nU.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 1.         The State argues that the\n\ncreation of Indian country within Rhode Island amounts to the\n\nformation of a new state within Rhode Island's jurisdiction.\n\n          This argument is without merit.     The Admissions Clause\n\nprohibits Congress only from unilaterally establishing within an\n\n                               -52-\n\fexisting state a body \"on an equal footing with the original states\n\nin all respects whatsoever.\"         Coyle v. Smith, 221 U.S. 559, 567\n\n(1911) (internal quotation marks omitted).             For purposes of the\n\nAdmissions Clause, a state is a body \"equal in power, dignity and\n\nauthority\"     to   existing   states.      Id.      The    Secretary's   trust\n\nacquisition for the Narragansetts does not establish such a body.\n\nAs a result, the acquisition does not violate the Admissions\n\nClause.\n\n           4.        The Nondelegation Doctrine\n\n           The      Constitution    vests    \"[a]ll        legislative    Powers\n\n[t]herein granted . . . in a Congress of the United States.\"                U.S.\n\nConst. art. I, § 1.      Congress \"is not permitted to abdicate, or to\n\ntransfer to others, the essential legislative functions with which\n\nit is . . . vested.\"        Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388,\n\n421 (1935).      Yet, the Supreme Court has recognized that \"in our\n\nincreasingly complex society, replete with ever changing and more\n\ntechnical problems, Congress simply cannot do its job absent an\n\nability   to     delegate   power   under    broad    general     directives.\"\n\nMistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 (1989).             As a result,\n\nthe Supreme Court has repeatedly held that Congress may confer\n\ndecisionmaking authority on agencies as long as it \"lay[s] down by\n\nlegislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or\n\nbody authorized to [act] is directed to conform.\"               Whitman v. Am.\n\nTrucking Ass'ns, 531 U.S. 457, 472 (2001) (second alteration in\n\n\n                                    -53-\n\foriginal) (quoting J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276\n\nU.S. 394, 409 (1928)) (internal quotation marks omitted).         The\n\nCourt \"has deemed it 'constitutionally sufficient if Congress\n\nclearly delineates the general policy, the public agency which is\n\nto apply it, and the boundaries of this delegated authority.'\"\n\nMistretta, 488 U.S. at 372-73 (quoting Am. Power & Light Co. v.\n\nSEC, 329 U.S. 90, 105 (1946)).\n\n            The State and its amici argue that section 465 lacks the\n\nrequisite    \"intelligible    principle\"   and   therefore   is   an\n\nunconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.\n\n            25 U.S.C. § 465 provides:\n\n            The Secretary of the Interior is authorized,\n            in his discretion, to acquire . . . any\n            interest in lands, . . . for the purpose of\n            providing land for Indians.\n\n            For the acquisition of such lands, . . . and\n            for expenses incident to such acquisition,\n            there is authorized to be appropriated, out of\n            any funds in the Treasury not otherwise\n            appropriated, a sum not to exceed $2,000,000\n            in any one fiscal year: Provided, That no part\n            of such funds shall be used to acquire\n            additional land outside of the exterior\n            boundaries of Navajo Indian Reservation for\n            the Navajo Indians in Arizona, nor in New\n            Mexico, in the event that legislation to\n            define the exterior boundaries of the Navajo\n            Indian Reservation in New Mexico . . . becomes\n            law.\n\n            . . . .\n\n            Title to any lands or rights acquired pursuant\n            to this Act . . . shall be taken in the name\n            of the United States in trust for the Indian\n            tribe or individual Indian for which the land\n\n                                 -54-\n\f            is acquired, and such lands or rights shall be\n            exempt from State and local taxation.\n\n25 U.S.C. § 465.\n\n            In support of its argument, the State relies primarily on\n\nan Eighth Circuit decision, South Dakota v. U.S. Dep't of the\n\nInterior, 69 F.3d 878 (8th Cir. 1995), vacated, 519 U.S. 919\n\n(1996), that held that section 465 was an impermissible delegation\n\nthat was completely lacking in \"boundaries\" and \"intelligible\n\nprinciples\" and that \"would permit the Secretary to purchase the\n\nEmpire State Building in trust for a tribal chieftain as a wedding\n\npresent.\"    Id. at 882.      The circuit opinion in South Dakota was\n\nvacated by the Supreme Court, which did not publish an opinion\n\nexplaining its decision, 519 U.S. at 919-20, and as a result has\n\nnot set any precedent.     Lovelace v. Se. Mass. Univ., 793 F.2d 419,\n\n422 (1st Cir. 1986) (per curiam).\n\n            On remand, the Eighth Circuit held that \"the purposes\n\nevidence in the whole of the IRA and its legislative history\n\nsufficiently   narrow   the    delegation   and   guide   the   Secretary's\n\ndiscretion in deciding when to take land into trust.\"19               South\n\nDakota v. U.S. Dep't of Interior, 423 F.3d 790, 797 (8th Cir.\n\n2005).    The court noted that the statute allows the Secretary to\n\n\n\n     19\n          In so holding, the Eighth Circuit agreed with the Tenth\nCircuit's decision in United States v. Roberts, 185 F.3d 1125 (10th\nCir. 1999), which held that section 465 contains standards\nsufficient to guide the Secretary's exercise of discretion. Id. at\n1137.\n\n                                   -55-\n\facquire trust lands only for Indians as defined in 25 U.S.C. § 479,\n\nand that the statute prohibits the Secretary from taking extra-\n\nreservation lands into trust for Navajo Indians.                  See 423 F.3d at\n\n797.        The South Dakota court also referred to the legislative\n\nhistory of the IRA,20 which explains that the goals motivating trust\n\nacquisitions are \"rehabilitati[on] [of] the Indian's economic life\"\n\nand    \"develop[ment]      [of]    the    initiative       destroyed    by    .     .   .\n\noppression and paternalism.\"            Id. at 798 (quoting Mescalero Apache\n\nTribe v. Jones, 411 U.S. 145, 152 (1973) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 73-\n\n1804, at 6-7 (1934))) (internal quotation marks omitted).                      As the\n\ndissent from the original South Dakota decision had noted, the\n\nhistorical       context   of     the    IRA    is   important;    section        465's\n\n\"direction that land be acquired 'for the purpose of providing land\n\nfor Indians[]' has specific meaning in light of the failure of the\n\nallotment policy and [c]ongressional rejection of assimilation as\n\na goal.\"       69 F.3d at 887 (Murphy, J., dissenting).\n\n               Other   provisions        of    the   IRA    reinforce        such       an\n\ninterpretation.        See 25 U.S.C. § 461 (prohibiting allotment of\n\nreservation lands to individual Indians); id. § 462 (extending\n\nindefinitely existing trust periods and restrictions on alienation\n\n\n\n       20\n          Amici states argue that legislative history should not\nfactor into the intelligible principle analysis. We note simply\nthat the Supreme Court in Mistretta referred to legislative history\nin explaining that the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 was not an\nunconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. See 488 U.S.\nat 375 n.9, 376 n.10.\n\n                                         -56-\n\fof Indian lands); id. § 463(a) (authorizing restoration of surplus\n\nlands to tribal ownership); id. § 464 (prohibiting the transfer of\n\nrestricted Indian lands except to Indian tribes).             We find the\n\nreasoning of the Eighth Circuit's second South Dakota opinion\n\npersuasive.\n\n            The Ninth Circuit's decision in Confederated Tribes of\n\nSiletz Indians of Oregon v. United States, 110 F.3d 688 (9th Cir.\n\n1997), also supports the Secretary's position that section 465 is\n\nnot   an   unconstitutional   delegation   of   legislative    authority.\n\nAlthough not addressing a nondelegation challenge to section 465,\n\nthe Confederated Tribes court stated that \"[t]he general delegation\n\nof power to the Executive to take land into trust for the Indians\n\nis a valid delegation because Congress has decided under what\n\ncircumstances land should be taken into trust and has delegated to\n\nthe Secretary of the Interior the task of deciding when this power\n\nshould be used.\"    Id. at 698.\n\n            The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of\n\nstatutes authorizing regulation in the \"public interest,\" see,\n\ne.g., Nat'l Broad. Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, 225-26\n\n(1943); N.Y. Cent. Sec. Corp. v. United States, 287 U.S. 12, 24-25\n\n(1932), as well as statutes authorizing regulation to ensure\n\nfairness and equity, see Am. Power & Light Co., 329 U.S. at 104-05;\n\nYakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 420, 426-27 (1944).          As the\n\nCourt stated in its most recent nondelegation decision, it has\n\n\n                                  -57-\n\f\"almost never felt qualified to second-guess Congress regarding the\n\npermissible degree of policy judgment that can be left to those\n\nexecuting or applying the law.\"        Am. Trucking Ass'ns, 531 U.S. at\n\n474-75     (quoting   Mistretta,     488   U.S.   at   416     (Scalia,    J.,\n\ndissenting)) (internal quotation marks omitted).               We similarly\n\ndecline to do so here.           We hold that section 465 is not an\n\nunconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.\n\nE.          APA-Related Claims\n\n            The focus of the en banc proceedings was on the three\n\nsets of arguments discussed above. The State presented another set\n\nof claims, rejected by the panel, that the Secretary's decision to\n\ntake the Parcel into trust for the Tribe violates the APA.                 The\n\nState did not seek en banc review of this issue.              In granting en\n\nbanc review, we withdrew our panel opinion, which had been reported\n\nat 423 F.3d 45.       In the interests of completeness, we now also\n\nreject the State's APA claims.\n\n            We set forth here a shortened and slightly modified\n\nversion of the panel's opinion as to this issue.\n\n            The State claims that the Secretary's action was an abuse\n\nof discretion under the APA.           Our review of the Secretary's\n\ndecision    is   governed   by   section   706(2)(A)   of    the   APA,   which\n\nprovides that a court may set aside agency action only where it\n\nfinds the action \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or\n\notherwise not in accordance with law.\"         5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).        An\n\n\n                                    -58-\n\fagency's determination is arbitrary and capricious if the agency\n\nlacks a rational basis for making the determination or if the\n\ndecision was not based on consideration of the relevant factors.\n\nSee Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463\n\nU.S. 29, 43 (1983); Associated Fisheries of Me., Inc. v. Daley, 127\n\nF.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 1997).     The Court's review under section\n\n706(2)(A) is highly deferential, and the Secretary's action is\n\npresumed to be valid.    See Conservation Law Found. of New Eng.,\n\nInc. v. Sec'y of Interior, 864 F.2d 954, 957-58 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\nA reviewing court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of\n\nthe agency.   Citizens To Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401\n\nU.S. 402, 416 (1971); Associated Fisheries, 127 F.3d at 109.     No\n\ndeference is given to the district court's decision.      Associate\n\nFisheries, 127 F.3d at 109.\n\n          The State makes five arguments as to why the Secretary's\n\ndecision was unlawful under section 706(2)(A): (1) the BIA relied\n\non the Tribe's findings, rather than conducting an independent\n\nevaluation of the Tribe's application; (2) the BIA misapplied the\n\nfactors enumerated in 25 C.F.R. § 151.10 for evaluating a fee-to-\n\ntrust transfer; (3) the Native American Housing Assistance and\n\nSelf-Determination Act cooperation agreement waiver violated due\n\nprocess; (4) the BIA failed to consider the environmental impact of\n\nthe housing project planned for the Parcel and the project's\n\ncompliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act; and (5) the BIA\n\n\n                                 -59-\n\ffailed to consider noncompliance with the Indian Gaming Regulatory\n\nAct.   We disagree, and we find that the Secretary's decision to\n\naccept the Parcel into trust did not violate the APA.\n\n            1.        Independent   Evaluation          of    the    Tribe's     Trust\n                      Application\n\n            The State claims that the BIA's decision to take the\n\nParcel into trust was arbitrary and capricious because it relied\n\nexclusively on the Tribe's assertions and failed to consider other\n\nimportant facts that occurred between 1993 and 1997.                        The State\n\npoints to substantial passages in the Secretary's decision that\n\ncontain    verbatim    restatements    of    information           provided    by    the\n\nNarragansett Tribe in support of their 1993 trust application as\n\nevidence that the BIA failed to conduct an independent evaluation\n\nof the Tribe's 1997 application.\n\n            There is ample evidence in the administrative record that\n\nthe BIA conducted its own, independent evaluation of the Tribe's\n\napplication and that it considered the events following the Tribe's\n\n1993 application.       For example, between 1993 and 1997, the BIA\n\nrequired    the   Tribe   to   supplement         its    initial         Environmental\n\nAssessment; conducted an environmental hazard survey of the Parcel;\n\nrequired confirmation of consistency with the State’s Coastal\n\nResources    Management    Plan;    was     apprised         of,    and    offered    to\n\nfacilitate, negotiations between the Tribe, the Town, and the State\n\nconcerning both environmental and jurisdictional issues attendant\n\nto   the   Tribe's    development   of      the    Parcel;         and    specifically\n\n                                      -60-\n\frequested that the Regional Solicitor address several legal and\n\njurisdictional issues raised by the State in its comments to the\n\nBIA on the Tribe's trust application.            This demonstrates that the\n\nBIA's     determination    was   the    result   of   its   own,   independent\n\nevaluation of the 1997 application.\n\n             2.       Application of the 25 C.F.R. § 151.10 Factors\n\n             The State claims that the BIA failed to apply the proper\n\ncriteria when it evaluated the Tribe's application for trust\n\nacquisition.        The regulations governing the BIA's evaluation of\n\napplications to have land taken in trust are laid out at 25 C.F.R.\n\npart 151.         The factors to be considered for an on-reservation\n\nacquisition are found in section 151.10, and the factors for an\n\noff-reservation acquisition are found in section 151.11.21                  In\n\nmaking the decision to accept the Parcel into trust, the BIA\n\nconsidered the on-reservation factors in section 151.10.22                 The\n\n\n     21\n          For the purpose of 25 C.F.R. part 151, land is considered\nto be on-reservation if it is \"located within or contiguous to an\nIndian reservation,\" 25 C.F.R. § 151.10, and off-reservation where\n\"the land is located outside of and noncontiguous to the tribe's\nreservation,\" id. § 151.11. The State challenges the finding by\nthe BIA and the district court that the Parcel is adjacent to the\nsettlement lands, yet recognizes that this determination is\ninsignificant to the application of either section in this case, as\nthe sections differ only slightly. Compare id. § 151.10, with id.\n§ 151.11.   The Parcel is adjacent to the Settlement Lands, but\nseparated from them by a town road.

The fact that\n\nthe BIA found the Parcel, which is across a town road from the\n\nsettlement lands, to be \"contiguous\" to the settlement lands that\n\nare currently in trust, and thus determined that it should consider\n\nthe \"on-reservation\" factors enumerated in 25 C.F.R. § 151.10, is\n\ncertainly not clear error and is within the Secretary's discretion.\n\nThe   record    shows   that    the    BIA    complied    with   section       151.10,\n\nincluding evaluating the Tribe's need for the additional land, and\n\nthe State has not shown that the Secretary made a clear error of\n\njudgment.\n\n            It was not necessary for the BIA to consider the factors\n\nunder   section    151.11,      since    it    found     section      151.10    to   be\n\napplicable to this trust determination.                While the Secretary need\n\nnot have considered section 151.11(b), the close proximity between\n\nthe Tribe's settlement lands and the Parcel would not have required\n\nthe   Secretary    to   give    the    greatest    scrutiny      to    the   \"tribe's\n\n\n                  reservation, shall be considered as\n                  follows: as the distance between the\n                  tribe's reservation and the land to be\n                  acquired increases, the Secretary shall\n                  give greater scrutiny to the tribe's\n                  justification of anticipated benefits\n                  from the acquisition. . . .\n\n25 C.F.R. § 151.11(b).\n\n                                        -63-\n\fjustification of anticipated benefits from the acquisition.\"                25\n\nC.F.R. § 151.11(b).\n\n            3.      The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-\n                    Determination    Act    Cooperation    Agreement\n                    Requirement\n\n            At the time of the BIA's decision to acquire the Parcel\n\ninto trust, HUD was precluded from releasing funds pursuant to the\n\nNative American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act for\n\nany tribe's housing development unless an agreement for local\n\ncooperation on issues such as taxes and jurisdiction had been\n\nentered into by the tribe and the local government where the\n\nhousing was located.       25 U.S.C. § 4111(c).       In the instant case,\n\nthe Narragansett Tribe did not obtain such an agreement with the\n\nTown.     However, section 4111(c) has since been amended to permit\n\nHUD to waive the cooperation agreement requirement, 25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 4111(c), as amended by Pub. L. No. 106-569, § 503(a)(2), 114\n\nStat. 2944, 2962 (2000), and the Tribe claims to have obtained such\n\na waiver.\n\n            The State argues that this waiver was invalid because the\n\nState apparently did not receive notice of the Tribe's application\n\nfor a waiver until after the waiver had been granted.               On appeal,\n\nthe State contends that if the BIA accepted the waiver, the BIA has\n\ninherited the legal error and acted in an arbitrary and capricious\n\nmanner.      As   the   district   court    noted,   \"25   U.S.C.   §   4111(c)\n\nestablishes a prerequisite to HUD's award of housing grants.

Nothing in the § 151.10 factors\n\nrequires the BIA to ensure that a local cooperation agreement is in\n\nplace for an Indian Housing project.\n\n              4.          Environmental Considerations\n\n              The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 4321-4370(f), and its supporting regulations promulgated by the\n\nCouncil on Environmental Quality (CEQ), 40 C.F.R. parts 1500-1518,\n\ndirect federal agencies to consider the environmental impact of\n\nagency decisions.           The State argues that the Secretary and the BIA\n\n(1) failed to consider the environmental impact in reaching the\n\ndecision to accept the Parcel into trust because no Environmental\n\nImpact Statement (EIS) was prepared, and (2) failed to conduct\n\ntheir own evaluation of the environmental impact and instead\n\nimproperly relied on an Environmental Assessment (EA) submitted by\n\nthe Narragansett Tribe.           We disagree.\n\n              Federal agencies are required to prepare an EIS for any\n\naction that could significantly affect the quality of the human\n\nenvironment.            42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C); 40 C.F.R. § 1502.3.             NEPA\n\nprovides that \"to the fullest extent possible . . . all agencies of\n\nthe Federal Government shall . . . include in every recommendation\n\nor     report      on    proposals     for    .     .   .   major   Federal   actions\n\nsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a\n\ndetailed statement by the responsible official on . . . the\n\n\n                                             -65-\n\fenvironmental     impact     of   the   proposed     action.\"    42   U.S.C.\n\n§ 4332(2)(C).         However, in the absence of a finding that the\n\nproposed action would significantly affect the quality of the human\n\nenvironment, the BIA was not required to prepare an EIS.               See,\n\ne.g., Londonderry Neighborhood Coal. v. Fed. Energy Regulatory\n\nComm'n, 273 F.3d 416, 419 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting Wyo. Outdoor\n\nCouncil v. U.S. Forest Serv., 165 F.3d 43, 49 (D.C. Cir. 1999)).\n\n             The CEQ has issued guidance on whether to prepare an EIS.\n\nThis guidance provides that \"if the agency determines on the basis\n\nof the environmental assessment not to prepare a statement,\" then\n\nthe agency should \"[p]repare a finding of no significant impact\"\n\npursuant to section 1508.13. 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(e). The applicant\n\nmay prepare the EA provided that the agency \"make[s] its own\n\nevaluation of the environmental issues and take[s] responsibility\n\nfor the scope and content of the environmental assessment.\"             Id.\n\n§ 1506.5(b). In this case, the BIA followed its standard operating\n\nprocedure for externally initiated proposals by obtaining an EA\n\nfrom   the    Tribe    and   considering    it   along   with   supplemental\n\ninformation the BIA requested from the Tribe and information\n\ngathered independently by the BIA.          See NEPA Handbook para. 4.2.B.\n\nAfter reviewing the EA and the requisite supplemental information,\n\nthe BIA completed its environmental analysis and issued a finding\n\nof no significant impact.         The BIA's issuance of a finding of no\n\n\n\n\n                                     -66-\n\fsignificant impact satisfied its responsibilities under NEPA.        See\n\n40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(e).\n\n           Separately, the State contends that the BIA should have\n\nobtained a federal consistency review in accordance with the\n\nCoastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), 16 U.S.C. §§ 1451-1466, before\n\nmaking    its   trust   determination.     The   CZMA   requires   state\n\nconsultation     on     federally    permitted   coastal    development\n\nactivities.24    The State asserts that the BIA's failure to take\n\n\n     24\n           Specifically, 16 U.S.C. § 1456(c) provides, in relevant\npart:\n\n                 (1)(A) Each Federal agency activity\n                 within or outside the coastal zone that\n                 affects any land or water use or natural\n                 resource of the coastal zone shall be\n                 carried out in a manner which is\n                 consistent   to    the   maximum   extent\n                 practicable with the enforceable policies\n                 of approved State management programs. A\n                 Federal agency activity shall be subject\n                 to this paragraph unless it is subject to\n                 paragraph (2) or (3).\n\n                 . . . .\n\n                 (C) Each Federal agency carrying out an\n                 activity subject to paragraph (1) shall\n                 provide a consistency determination to\n                 the relevant State agency . . . .\n\n                 (2) Any Federal agency which shall\n                 undertake any development project in the\n                 coastal zone of a state shall insure that\n                 the project is, to the maximum extent\n                 practicable,    consistent    with    the\n                 enforceable policies of approved State\n                 management programs.\n\n\n\n                                    -67-\n\fdirect action to ensure that the housing project was consistent\n\nwith the Rhode Island Coastal Zone Management Program (RICZMP)\n\nbefore making its trust determination was a violation of the CZMA.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n          The State has failed to demonstrate that a consistency\n\nreview of the Tribe's housing development was necessary at the\n\ntrust acquisition stage.    The development of the Parcel is a\n\nproject that was commenced by the Tribe, in conjunction with HUD,\n\nprior to the Tribe's application for trust acquisition.   The Rhode\n\nIsland Coastal Resources Management Council correctly recognized\n\nthat the development of the Parcel, which required its own federal\n\nconsistency determination, was a separate matter from the trust\n\nacquisition, and properly found that the Tribe's application for\n\ntrust status was consistent with the RICZMP.\n\n          5.     The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act\n\n          Finally, the State contends that the true purpose of the\n\nTribe's application for trust acquisition is the development of\n\ngambling facilities on the Parcel –- rather than development of\n\ntribal housing as the BIA found in its evaluation pursuant to 25\n\nC.F.R. § 151.10(c) -- and that the BIA's failure to consider the\n\nIndian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 2701-2721, in its\n\ndecision was an abuse of discretion.      We reject the State's\n\nargument that the Secretary's decision to acquire the Parcel in\n\n\n\n\n                              -68-\n\ftrust should be reversed and that further inquiry into whether the\n\nParcel would be used for gaming purposes is now required.\n\n          No evidence that the Tribe intends to use the Parcel for\n\nanything other than tribal housing, as determined by the BIA, was\n\npresented.   \"In fact, after the plaintiffs expressed concern over\n\nthe potential for development of a gaming facility on the parcel,\n\nthe tribe reaffirmed that it intended to use the parcel for a\n\nhousing development and stated that it had 'no immediate plans for\n\nany further future development.'\" Carcieri, 290 F. Supp. 2d at 178\n\n(quoting II Admin. Rec., tab N).\n\n          As support for its position, the State points to an IBIA\n\ndecision that reversed a trust acquisition decision due to the\n\nBIA's failure to consider the impact of a potential casino, even\n\nthough the applicants denied any intention of using the property\n\nfor a casino.   See Vill. of Ruidoso, N.M. v. Albuquerque Area Dir.,\n\nBureau of Indian Affairs, 32 I.B.I.A. 130 (1998).        However, in\n\nVillage of Ruidoso, the IBIA determined that, despite the tribe's\n\ndenial that the application for trust acquisition was for gaming\n\npurposes, it was clear from the planned gaming-related uses of the\n\nproperty and the fact that the property had been given to the tribe\n\nby a company that the BIA \"apparently understood to have some\n\ngaming connection with the Tribe\" that the application might well\n\nhave been for gaming purposes.   Id. at 136.   In that situation, the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -69-\n\fBIA should have further analyzed the possibility of gaming. Id. at\n\n140.\n\n          We agree with the district court that\n\n          although the possibility that the parcel might\n          be used for gaming activities was raised\n          before the BIA, the bureau's determination\n          that the parcel would be used to provide\n          housing was amply supported by the record. In\n          view of the deferential standard of review\n          afforded to agency decisions under the APA,\n          the bureau's determination in this regard must\n          be sustained.\n\nCarcieri, 290 F. Supp. 2d at 178.\n\n                                III.\n\n          The decision of the district court is affirmed.   Costs\n\nare awarded to the Secretary.\n\n                  -Dissenting opinion follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                -70-\n\f          HOWARD,    Circuit   Judge,    dissenting.   Respectfully,   I\n\ndisagree with the majority's analysis of the Settlement Act. In my\n\nview, the majority opinion disregards Congress's (and the parties')\n\npurpose in passing the Settlement Act and is inconsistent with our\n\nown recent interpretation of the Settlement Act.       See Narragansett\n\nIndian Tribe v. Rhode Island, 449 F.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2006) (en\n\nbanc). At bottom, under the Settlement Act, the Secretary may only\n\ntake the Parcel into a restricted trust25 that provides for Rhode\n\nIsland's continued criminal and civil jurisdiction over the Parcel.\n\nThe State makes this argument in two forms.      First, by arguing that\n\nthe Settlement Act effectuates a partial implied repeal of the IRA\n\nas to state jurisdiction on land taken into trust by the BIA.\n\nSecond, by arguing that the statutes can be harmonized       by reading\n\nthe IRA narrowly and subject to the Settlement Act's provisions.\n\nEither approach gets to the same conclusion. Significantly, the\n\ngenerous rules of \"Indian construction\" do not apply in analyzing\n\nan implied repeal.    See Passamaquoddy Tribe v. State of Maine, 75\n\nF.3d 784, 790 (1st Cir. 1996) (the normal principles of implied\n\nrepeal are applied in the Indian law context).\n\n\n\n\n     25\n          I do not challenge the majority's conclusion that the BIA\nmay take the Parcel into trust, as the State previously permitted\nthe Narragansetts to take the Settlement Lands into trust in 1988.\nBut any new trust lands must also be explicitly made subject to the\nState's criminal and civil laws.\n\n\n                                  -71-\n\f          The parties and amici do an excellent job in acquainting\n\nthe court with the many complexities of both the case and the\n\nissues inherent in \"Indian law.\"   However, the ultimate resolution\n\nof the case comes down to a very narrow question: In the specific\n\ncontext of the Tribe and State, what did Congress intend the\n\nSettlement Act to do?\n\n          The key provision is Section 1705, which is written far\n\nmore broadly than the majority concludes.26       In its first two\n\nprovisions that section retroactively ratifies all the Tribe's\n\nprior land transfers anywhere in the United States and extinguishes\n\nthe Tribe's aboriginal title in all such lands.    See 25 U.S.C. §\n\n1705(a)(1) & (2).   More significantly, Section 1705 goes on to\n\nextinguish future land claims:\n\n          (3)by virtue of the approval of a transfer of\n          land or natural resources effected by this\n          section, or an extinguishment of aboriginal\n          title effected thereby, all claims against the\n          United States, any State or subdivision\n          thereof, or any other person or entity, by the\n          Indian Corporation or any other entity\n          presently or at any time in the past known as\n          the Narragansett Tribe of Indians, or any\n          predecessor or successor in interest, member\n          of stockholder thereof, or any other Indian,\n          Indian nation, or tribe of Indians, arising\n          subsequent to the transfer and based upon any\n          interest in or right involving such land or\n          natural resources (including but not limited\n          to claims for trespass damages or claims for\n\n\n\n     26\n          Indeed, the very breadth of the language indicates more\nwas contemplated by the parties than merely resolving an immediate\ndispute over title.\n\n                                 -72-\n\f             use and occupancy) shall be regarded as\n             extinguished as of the date of the transfer.\n\nId. § 1705(a)(3). This provision obviously goes well beyond merely\n\nextinguishing aboriginal title (and claims based thereon), which\n\nwas accomplished in the prior subsection.             See id. § 1705(a)(2).\n\nThis language forecloses any future \"Indian\" land claim of any type\n\nby the Tribe regarding land in Rhode Island (or anywhere in the\n\nUnited States, for that matter).        Thus, Congress (and the parties)\n\nintended to resolve all the Tribe's land claims in the state once\n\nand for all.\n\n             The majority argues that Section 1705(a)(3) cannot be\n\nread    so   broadly;   otherwise,   the    Tribe   would   be   barred    from\n\nasserting any land claims.        See ante, at 42-43.       But the majority\n\ndisregards a significant factor -- the nature of the land claims\n\nthat were barred.       The legislative history of the Settlement Act\n\nspecifically states that the \"extinguishment of Indian land claims\n\nis limited to those claims raised by Indians qua Indians.\" H.R.\n\nRep. 95-1453, at 1955 (1978) (emphasis added).               As we recently\n\nstated, through the Settlement Act \"the Tribe abandoned any right\n\nto an autonomous enclave, submitting itself to state law as a quid\n\npro quo for obtaining the land that it cherished.\"               Narragansett\n\nTribe, 449 F.3d at 22.       Thus, the Tribe would be free to assert any\n\nclaim that any other landowner in Rhode Island could make under\n\nstate   law,   but   would   be   foreclosed   from   making     claims   based\n\nentirely on the Tribe's status as an Indian tribe.               It is beyond\n\n                                     -73-\n\fperadventure that asking to have land taken into trust by the BIA\n\nunder the IRA to effect an ouster of state jurisdiction is a\n\nquintessential \"Indian\" land claim.27\n\n           Moreover, \"Congress does not legislate in a vacuum,\" and\n\namong the matters that a court must consider in assessing a statute\n\nare   general   policies   and   pre-existing    statutory   provisions.\n\nPassamaquoddy Tribe, 75 F.3d at 789.            The Settlement Act was\n\nenacted over 40 years after Section 465 of the IRA and, given the\n\nexplicit acknowledgment of possible future recognition for the\n\nTribe,28 Congress was well aware of the IRA when enacting the\n\nSettlement Act.    It is neither logical nor necessary to find that\n\nCongress enacted legislation effectuating this carefully calibrated\n\ncompromise between three sovereigns, which required significant\n\nexpenditures by both the federal government and the State, which\n\nprovided a significant amount of land to the Tribe, and which\n\nprovided for a delicate balancing of the parties' interests, only\n\nto permit the legislation to be completely subverted by subsequent\n\nagency action.\n\n\n\n\n      27\n          The Tribe would still have the option of obtaining the\nState's consent to make certain Indian land claims -- such as the\n1988 placement of the settlement lands in trust (subject to Rhode\nIsland law) with the BIA.\n      28\n          The Tribe's recognition by the BIA changed little, as\nthis court has held that the jurisdictional grant to the State in\nthe Settlement Act survived such recognition.    See Narragansett\nIndian Tribe, 19 F.3d at 694-95.\n\n                                  -74-\n\f           On this score, the majority misses the exquisite irony\n\nthat the Parcel was part of the lands originally claimed by the\n\nTribe.    It would be antithetical to Congress' intent to allow the\n\nTribe to purchase a portion of the originally disputed lands that\n\nwere the subject of the earlier lawsuits that ultimately led to the\n\nJMOU and Settlement Act, place it in trust with the BIA, and\n\nthereby create \"Indian country\" in direct contravention of the\n\nSettlement      Act's   prohibitions.       For   this    same   reason,     the\n\nmajority's attempt to distinguish our recent Narragansett Tribe\n\nopinion    as    pertaining   only    to    the   \"Settlement       Lands\"    is\n\nunpersuasive.     See ante, at 37 n.11.      By that reasoning, the Tribe\n\ncould swap the Settlement Lands for adjacent land and undo any\n\nlimitations contained in the Settlement Act.              The Settlement Act\n\ncannot be reasonably construed to allow such absurd results.\n\n           Further, the Settlement Act was novel; it was the first\n\nstatute    resolving     Indian   land      claims,      premised   upon     the\n\nNonintercourse Act, growing out of an out-of-court settlement\n\nnegotiated by a tribe and the state/landowners.             See H.R. 95-1453,\n\nat 1951 (1978).     Indeed, it was expected to serve as a template for\n\nthe resolution of other Eastern tribes' land claims under the\n\nNonintercourse Act. See id.; see also Oneida Indian Nation, 125 S.\n\nCt. at 1483-85 (discussing Nonintercourse Act and original 13\n\nstates' \"pre-emptive right to purchase from the Indians\").                    In\n\nlight of the fact that the Settlement Act was the first statute of\n\n\n                                     -75-\n\fits kind, the majority's observation that subsequent statutes were\n\nmore explicit in limiting certain aspects of the Secretary's power\n\nproves    nothing.      Elaborate   statements      regarding   the    Tribe's\n\nrelationship with the BIA would have been unwarranted in the\n\nSettlement Act, given that the Tribe had not yet been recognized.\n\n            Moreover,    that   subsequent   acts    dealing    with   Eastern\n\ntribes made specific provision for the Secretary's ability to take\n\nland in trust for a tribe, see, e.g., 25 U.S.C. § 1771d(c) & (d)\n\n(Massachusetts Indian Claims Settlement); id. § 1724(d) (Maine\n\nIndian Claims Settlement); id. § 1754(b) (Connecticut Indian Claims\n\nSettlement), supports the conclusion that Congress anticipated no\n\nsuch result under the Settlement Act.          Given that the State had\n\nfull criminal and civil jurisdiction over its territory, that any\n\npotential jurisdictional issue concerning the Settlement Lands was\n\nspecifically addressed, and that all future Indian land claims were\n\nbarred, there would be no future land scenarios that Congress would\n\nneed to address more specifically (as it did in the other acts).29\n\nAs we have noted, \"the Settlement Act, properly read, ensures that\n\nthe State may demand the Tribe's compliance with state laws of\n\ngeneral application.\"      Narragansett Tribe, 449 F.3d at 26.\n\n\n     29\n          In extinguishing the Tribe's aboriginal title in the\nSettlement Act, Congress was inspired by the Alaska Native Claims\nSettlement Act (\"ANCSA\"). See H.R. Rep. 95-1453, at 1951. As\nnoted by the Supreme Court, the ANCSA sought to accomplish this\ngoal \"without creating a reservation system or lengthy wardship or\ntrusteeship.\" Alaska v. Native Village of Venetie Tribal Govt., 522\nU.S. 520, 524 (1998) (internal citation and quotation omitted).\n\n                                    -76-\n\f           There is also nothing novel about requiring the BIA to\n\naccept the Parcel into trust with restrictions.         The BIA is\n\nauthorized to take restricted interests in land into trust, see 25\n\nU.S.C. § 465, and, in dealing with other tribes, Congress has\n\nspecifically directed the BIA to take land into trust subject to a\n\nsettlement act's provisions, see, e.g., id. § 1771d(d); id. §\n\n1773b.\n\n           It is also worth noting that Congress acted promptly to\n\npreserve the State's jurisdiction over the Tribe's lands the last\n\ntime this court challenged it.   When this court held that the Tribe\n\nexercised sufficient jurisdiction and governmental authority over\n\nthe Settlement Lands to invoke the Indian Regulatory Gaming Act,\n\nsee Narragansett Tribe, 19 F.3d at 703, Congress promptly amended\n\nthe Settlement Act to provide explicitly that the Settlement Lands\n\nare not \"Indian lands\" for purposes of that Act, see 25 U.S.C. §\n\n1708(b).\n\n           I respectfully dissent.\n\n                   -Dissenting opinion follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                 -77-\n\f            SELYA,    Senior       Circuit    Judge,    dissenting.        I     am   in\n\ncomplete   agreement        with   Judge     Howard's    cogent     and   articulate\n\ndissent,   and   I   join     it   unreservedly.         Nevertheless,       I   write\n\nseparately to express my regret that, in taking far too narrow a\n\nview of the Settlement Act, the majority gives short shrift not\n\nonly to the interests of the State of Rhode Island but also to the\n\ncarefully calibrated arrangements crafted between the State and the\n\nTribe.\n\n            We previously have made clear that the touchstone in\n\nresolving jurisdictional disputes between the State and the Tribe\n\nis the full effectuation of the parties' intent. See Narrangansett\n\nIndian Tribe v. Rhode Island, 449 F.3d 16, 22, 25 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(en banc). Yet, today, the majority sets aside the parties' intent\n\nin favor of a wooden reading of one subsection of the Settlement\n\nAct.    See ante at 37 (\"By its terms, section 1708(a) applies state\n\nlaw only to the 1800 acres of 'settlement lands.' The Parcel is not\n\npart of the settlement lands.\").\n\n            Despite the artful draftmanship of the majority opinion,\n\nthe provision on which it relies cannot be wrested from its\n\nhistorical context and read in a vacuum.                The Settlement Act, when\n\ntaken    together    with    the    extinguishment       of   all   Indian       claims\n\nreferable to lands in Rhode Island, the Tribe's surrender of its\n\nright to an autonomous enclave, and the waiver of much of its\n\nsovereign immunity, see Narrangansett Indian Tribe, 449 F.3d at 22,\n\n\n                                        -78-\n\f24-25, suggests with unmistakable clarity that the parties intended\n\nto fashion a broad arrangement that preserved the State's civil,\n\ncriminal, and regulatory jurisdiction over any and all lands within\n\nits borders. Therefore, the Settlement Act logically and equitably\n\nshould be read to prohibit any unilateral action that would upset\n\nthis hard-bargained and delicate jurisdictional balance.\n\n            The Secretary's taking of an after-acquired parcel into\n\nan unrestricted trust is just such an event.       It strains credulity\n\nto surmise, as does the majority, that the State would have made\n\nsuch substantial concessions — including the transfer, free and\n\nclear, of 1800 acres of its land — while leaving open the gaping\n\nloophole that today's decision creates.\n\n            The majority admits that this case is \"in many ways a\n\nproxy for the State's larger concerns about its sovereignty,\" ante\n\nat 4, including the State's understandable worry that the Tribe\n\nwill use this parcel (or future parcels that might be acquired and\n\nplaced into trust) for activities that would be forbidden under\n\nState law and anathema to a majority of the State's citizens.          At\n\noral argument, the Secretary of the Interior and the Bureau of\n\nIndian Affairs appeared to disclaim any vestige of responsibility\n\nfor   the   State's   concerns.   Despite   this   disclaimer   and   \"the\n\ngenuineness of the State's sense that its bargain has been upset,\"\n\nante at 47, the majority turns its back on the State.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -79-\n\f             In my view, this is error — and error of the most\n\ndeleterious kind.       The majority, without anything approaching\n\nsufficient    justification, is engaging in pointless literalism and\n\nforcing the State to rely on the faint velleity that the Secretary\n\nwill   use   caution   in   the   exercise   of   his   responsibilities   in\n\nconnection with the Parcel.        While \"hope\" is the official motto of\n\nRhode Island,     the State should not be force-fed hope in place of\n\nrights for which it has bargained.\n\n             As Indian tribes evolve in modern society, old legal\n\nrules tend to blur.     The controversy that divides our court today\n\nis vexing and of paramount importance to both the State and the\n\nTribe.   Thus, the issue — as well as the underlying principles of\n\nIndian law — doubtless would benefit from consideration by the\n\nSupreme Court.     That is a consummation devoutly to be wished.           In\n\nthe meantime, however, there is too much at stake to allow the\n\nTribe, with the contrivance of the Secretary's taking the Parcel\n\ninto trust, to walk away from an arrangement that it helped to\n\nfashion and from which it has benefitted over the years.\n\n             I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -80-\n\f",

The case is in many ways a proxy for the State's larger concerns about its sovereignty vis-à-vis federal and tribal control over lands within the state.</p>\n<p>In 1998, the Secretary of the Interior agreed to take into unreserved trust for the Tribe's benefit a 31- or 32-acre parcel in Charlestown, Rhode Island (the Parcel). Then-Secretary Gale Norton cited her powers under section 5 of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (IRA), 25 U.S.C. § 465. The Tribe had purchased the Parcel in 1991.</p>\n<p>Under the Indian Commerce Clause of the Constitution, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3, Congress has plenary power to legislate on the subject of Indian tribes. <i>Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico,</i> 490 U.S. 163, 192, 109 S.Ct. 1698, 104 L.Ed.2d 209 (1989). As a result, Congress may preempt the operation of state law in Indian country. <i>See </i><i>New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe,</i> 462 U.S. 324, 333, 103 S.Ct. 2378, 76 L.Ed.2d 611 (1983). Under section 5 of the IRA, Congress has authorized the Secretary \"in his discretion\" to acquire and take into trust for Indian tribes \"any interest in lands . . . within or without existing reservations . . . for the purpose of providing land for Indians.\" 25 U.S.C. § 465. The Secretary may take land into trust for these purposes, as was done here, without the consent of the State.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The Secretary's acquisition of land into trust for Indians results in the land becoming \"Indian country.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1151. Generally speaking, primary jurisdiction over land that is Indian country <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> rests with the federal government and the Indian tribe inhabiting it, not with the state. <i>Alaska v. Native Vill. of Venetie Tribal Gov't,</i> 522 U.S. 520, 527 n. 1, 118 S.Ct. 948, 140 L.Ed.2d 30 (1988). To be more precise,</p>\n<blockquote>\"[w]hen on-reservation conduct involving only Indians is at issue, state law is generally inapplicable, for the State's regulatory interest is likely to be minimal and the federal interest in encouraging tribal self-government is at its strongest.\" When, however, state interests outside the reservation are implicated, States [sometimes] may regulate the activities even of tribe members on tribal land. . . .</blockquote>\n<p><i>Nevada v. Hicks,</i> 533 U.S. 353, 362, 121 S.Ct. 2304, 150 L.Ed.2d 398 (2001) (citation omitted) (quoting <i>White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker,</i> 448 U.S. 136, 144, 100 S.Ct. 2578, 65 L.Ed.2d 665 (1980)).</p>\n<p>Recognizing a conflict between state jurisdiction and the federal interest in encouraging tribal self-governance, the Secretary's regulations under the IRA provide that \"none of the laws . . . of any State . . . limiting, zoning or otherwise governing, regulating, or controlling the use or development of any real or personal property . . . shall be applicable\" to land held in trust for a tribe by the United States. 25 C.F.R. § 1.4(a). This provision is subject to the Secretary's power in specific cases or areas to make applicable those local laws determined to be in the best interest of the Indian owners \"in achieving the highest and best use of [the] property.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1.4(b).</p>\n<p>Concerned over the loss of sovereignty over the Parcel and what it may portend for the future, the State, its Governor, and the town of Charlestown (collectively, the State), sued the Secretary of the Interior, now Dirk Kempthorne, and the Regional Director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Franklin Keel, in federal court. <i>See </i><i>Carcieri v. Norton,</i> 290 F.Supp.2d 167 (D.R.I.2003). Having exhausted administrative remedies, the State brought suit under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 702, seeking review of the Secretary's decision to take the Parcel into trust. <i>Id.</i> at 169, 172.</p>\n<p>The State's case asserts three major theories. First, the State argues that the IRA does not authorize the Secretary to take land into trust for any tribe, including the Narragansetts, that first received federal recognition after June 18, 1934, the effective date of the IRA. Second, the State argues that the 1978 Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act (the Settlement Act), 25 U.S.C. §§ 1701-1716, restricts the Secretary's authority to place the Parcel into trust pursuant to the IRA. Third, the State argues that the Constitution prohibits this exercise of authority by the Secretary.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>As to the IRA, the State argues that the Narragansetts do not meet the definition of \"Indian\" contained in 25 U.S.C. § 479. The pertinent definition recognizes, inter alia, \"all persons of Indian descent who are members of any recognized Indian tribe <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> <i>now</i> under Federal jurisdiction.\" 25 U.S.C. § 479 (emphasis added). The State reads \"are members . . . now under Federal jurisdiction\" to plainly and literally mean the 1934 effective date of the IRA. The State thus contends that the Secretary has no authority under the IRA to take land into trust for any tribe that was not federally recognized in 1934. As a result, the State argues, the Secretary is precluded entirely from placing the Parcel into trust for the Narragansetts, who were not recognized as a tribe until 1983.</p>\n<p>Next, the State argues that the terms of the Settlement Act preclude the Secretary from placing the Parcel into trust because the Settlement Act is a later specific act of Congress that must be read to have explicitly and implicitly cabined the Tribe's and the Secretary's power as to the Parcel. The State argues that the Settlement Act bars the imposition of any trust. The State's fallback position is that any trust must be restricted by the terms of the Settlement Act so that it is clear that state and local law apply to the Parcel, just as they do to the settlement lands.</p>\n<p>Finally, the State asserts various constitutional theories, with the common underpinning that the placing of the Parcel into trust violates the State's sovereignty. The State argues that the Indian Commerce Clause does not authorize the Secretary's exercise of power and that the exercise violates the Tenth Amendment, as well as the Enclave and Admissions Clauses of the Constitution. The State also argues that section 5 of the IRA, 25 U.S.C. § 465, constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</p>\n<p>We hold that the language of 25 U.S.C. § 479 does not plainly refer to the 1934 enactment date of the IRA. We find that the text is sufficiently ambiguous in its use of the term \"now\" that the Secretary has, under the <i>Chevron</i> doctrine, authority to construe the Act. We reject the State's claim that we do not owe deference to the Secretary's interpretation because he has inconsistently interpreted or applied section 479. The State's evidence of inconsistency is mixed and is not persuasive. The Secretary's position has not been inconsistent, much less arbitrary. The Secretary's interpretation is rational and not inconsistent with the statutory language or legislative history, and must be honored.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the Settlement Act neither explicitly bars by its terms the Secretary's actions, nor implicitly repeals or constrains the Secretary's authority under the IRA to place land into trust for the Tribe. While the State apparently failed to anticipate this particular problem at the time of the settlement, the Settlement Act did specifically contemplate the event of federal recognition of the Tribe and did not restrict the Secretary's power, should the Tribe be recognized, to take into trust land outside of the settlement lands. We are not free to reform the Act. If aggrieved, the State must turn to Congress.</p>\n<p>The State's arguments based on allocations of power under the U.S. Constitution also do not prevail. They do, however, underscore the seriousness of the State's concern about the abrogation of state sovereignty at stake here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>In order to understand the nature of the controversy and the consequences of this decision, a brief recounting of the history of relations between the State and the Tribe is required. Further background can be found in the district court's opinion, <i>Carcieri,</i> 290 F.Supp.2d 167, as well as the opinions previously issued in the decades-long disputes between the State and the Tribe, <i>see </i><i>Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Rhode Island (Narragansett III),</i> 449 F.3d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> 16 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc); <i>Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Narragansett Elec. Co. (Narragansett II),</i> 89 F.3d 908 (1st Cir. 1996); <i>Rhode Island v. Narragansett Indian Tribe (Narragansett I),</i> 19 F.3d 685 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>In 1880, the State acquired the majority of the Tribe's lands. In 1934, the Tribe organized as a state-chartered corporation. In 1975, the Tribe sued to recover its lands, arguing that the State had acquired the lands in violation of the Indian Nonintercourse Act, 25 U.S.C. § 177. The Tribe claimed that this violation rendered void the transfer of title to the lands.</p>\n<p>This cloud on title prompted the State to enter into settlement negotiations with the Tribe, which led in 1978 to an agreement embodied in a Joint Memorandum of Understanding (JMOU). Under the JMOU, the Tribe would receive 1800 acres of \"settlement lands,\" half of which were provided by the State and half of which were purchased with federal funds. The State agreed to create an Indian-controlled corporation to hold the settlement lands in trust for the Tribe, to exempt the settlement lands from local taxation, and to help secure the federal legislation necessary to implement the agreement. In exchange, the Tribe abandoned its claims of aboriginal title and its claims to lands in the state other than the settlement lands.</p>\n<p>In turn, Congress approved and codified the agreement in the Settlement Act. The Settlement Act provided that \"the settlement lands shall be subject to the civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of the State of Rhode Island.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1708(a).</p>\n<p>Five years later, in 1983, the Secretary granted the Tribe official federal recognition. <i>See</i> Final Determination for Federal Acknowledgment of Narragansett Indian Tribe of Rhode Island, 48 Fed.Reg. 6177 (Feb. 10, 1983). Following that recognition, in 1985, Rhode Island amended the pertinent state statute to permit the conveyance of the settlement lands directly to the Tribe, explicitly preserving the State's jurisdiction over the settlement lands, consistent with the Settlement Act, 25 U.S.C. § 1708(a). <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws § 37-18-13(b). The holding company conveyed the settlement lands to the Tribe, and three years later, the Tribe conveyed the settlement lands to the BIA as trustee. The trust deed confirmed the application of state law to the settlement lands, as provided in 25 U.S.C. § 1708(a). The BIA continues to hold the settlement lands in trust for the Tribe, subject to this congressionally-enacted restriction that state law applies. <i>See </i><i>Narragansett I,</i> 19 F.3d at 689, 695 n. 8. Significantly, in our earlier en banc decision in <i>Narragansett III,</i> we held that the language of section 1708(a) trumped any residual tribal sovereignty over the settlement lands, under which the Tribe had refused to comply with certain state laws.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See</i> 449 F.3d at 26.</p>\n<p>Then, in 1991, the tribal housing authority purchased the Parcel in fee simple, acquiring title through purchase from a private developer. The Parcel was part of the Tribe's aboriginal lands claimed in the 1976 lawsuit. Under the Settlement Act, the Tribe had thus relinquished aboriginal title to the Parcel, but the Parcel is not part of the 1800 acres of settlement lands. It is adjacent to the settlement lands, across a town road. In 1992, the Housing Authority transferred the Parcel to the Tribe with a deed restriction that the Parcel be placed in trust with the BIA for the purpose of providing housing.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> A dispute soon arose over whether development of the Parcel had to comply with local law. The Tribe began construction on the planned housing project without obtaining a building permit from the Town or the State's approval of the individual sewage disposal systems. The Tribe essentially took the position that once it had purchased the Parcel, the land had become tribal land, and the Tribe's inherent sovereignty meant that the Parcel was exempt from local law. The State disagreed and filed suit in federal court to enjoin the Tribe. <i>See </i><i>Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Narragansett Elec. Co.,</i> 878 F.Supp. 349 (D.R.I.1995). Ultimately, the Tribe lost that litigation.<sup>[4]</sup><i>See </i><i>Narragansett II,</i> 89 F.3d at 922.</p>\n<p>The Tribe had sought to solve the issue of the applicability of state law to the Parcel by applying to the Secretary in 1993 to have the Parcel taken into trust under section 5 of the IRA. The Secretary's determination of whether to do so was stayed pending the resolution of the federal court litigation. After the litigation was resolved against the Tribe by this court in 1996, <i>id.</i> at 922, the Tribe submitted a second application to the Secretary.</p>\n<p>The Tribe filed this updated application with the Secretary in July 1997. In determining whether to take lands into trust, the Secretary follows a regulatory process set forth at 25 C.F.R. part 151, which requires consideration of several factors. If, as here, the land is off reservation, additional criteria apply. <i>See</i> 25 C.F.R. § 151.11. Generally, the farther from a reservation the land is, the greater the scrutiny the Secretary gives to the justification of anticipated benefits from the acquisition. <i>See id.</i> § 151.11(e); <i>see also</i> M.J. Sheppard, <i>Taking Indian Land into Trust,</i> 44 S.D. L.Rev. 681, 686 (1999).</p>\n<p>On March 6, 1998, the BIA notified the State of the Secretary's intent to take the Parcel into trust for the Tribe. The State appealed the decision to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals (IBIA). The State argued, inter alia, that the Settlement Act prohibited this action by the Secretary, and that in taking the land into trust without the State's consent, the Secretary had acted unconstitutionally. The IBIA affirmed the BIA's determination on June 29, 2000. <i>Town of Charlestown v. E. Area Dir., Bureau of Indian Affairs,</i> 35 I.B.I.A. 93, 106 (2000). It noted it had no jurisdiction over the claims of unconstitutionality.<sup>[5]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 97.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> The State then instituted this action in federal court. The district court, in a comprehensive decision, rejected the State's claims. <i>See </i><i>Carcieri,</i> 290 F.Supp.2d 167. A divided panel of this court affirmed. <i>Carcieri v. Norton,</i> 423 F.3d 45 (1st Cir. 2005). The en banc court granted rehearing and withdrew the panel opinion.</p>\n<p>As described above and recounted in our en banc decision in <i>Narragansett III,</i> 449 F.3d at 18-21, for several decades the relationship between the Tribe and the State has been fraught with tension.</p>\n<p>The State's short-term concerns in this case have to do with whether the particular project will conform with state and local law. The State also has concerns that once land is taken into trust, there will be very few mechanisms, other than negotiation with the Tribe or appeal to the Secretary's authority under 25 C.F.R. § 1.4(b), by which the State may secure compliance with state and local laws.<sup>[6]</sup> The State fears that the Tribe will convert or otherwise use the Parcel, or any future parcels that might be acquired and put into trust, for income-producing activities in which it normally would not be permitted to engage under state law.</p>\n<p>There has been federal litigation between state officials and the Tribe and its members over such activities. In 2003, the Tribe, seeking revenue, established on the settlement lands an Indian Smoke Shop that sold cigarettes without purchasing state cigarette stamps or collecting sales taxes then paid to the State, as required by state law. The State Police raided the smoke shop and initiated criminal prosecutions against tribe members. The Tribe sought a declaratory judgment in federal court asserting that its control over the smoke shop was an inherent function of tribal sovereignty that survived the Settlement Act, despite the explicit language in section 1708(a). We rejected that claim en banc. <i>Narragansett III,</i> 449 F.3d at 30-31.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n<p>Technically, the claims at issue here are reviewed through the lens of an APA appeal under 5 U.S.C. § 706. Our review of such an appeal is de novo as to the district court's conclusions. <i>See </i><i>Harvey v. Veneman,</i> 396 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 2005). The underlying issues remaining in the case are statutory and constitutional. Statutory issues are reviewed de novo by the courts, but subject to established principles of deference to the administering agency. <i>Id.</i> Constitutional claims are reviewed de novo. <i>See </i><i>Cousins v. Sec'y of Transp.,</i> 880 F.2d 603, 610 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> B. <i>The 1934 Indian Reorganization Act</i></p>\n<p>The State argues that the Secretary lacks authority to place the Parcel into trust under 25 U.S.C. § 465 since, under the definition of \"Indian\" in 25 U.S.C. § 479, that authority extends only to tribes that were both federally \"recognized\" and \"under [f]ederal jurisdiction\" on June 18, 1934, the effective date of the IRA.</p>\n<p>The State presents a series of cascading arguments. First, the State argues that the plain language of section 479 is clear, and that under that plain language, the Tribe's status is measured as of 1934. The State further argues that its interpretation of the statute is the only one consistent with the purposes and legislative history of the Act. Thus, the State argues that because the statute is unambiguous, deference to the Secretary is unwarranted. In any event, the State argues that even if deference might have been warranted, the Secretary's current interpretation is not entitled to deference because it contradicts the Secretary's practice in the more than seventy years since the passage of the IRA.</p>\n<p>1. Chevron <i>Analysis</i></p>\n<p>The Secretary has offered an interpretation of the IRA that permits trust acquisitions for tribes recognized and under federal jurisdiction at the time the request for a trust acquisition is made. A court reviewing an agency's interpretation of a statute that it administers engages in a two-step analysis. <i>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). We must first consider \"whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\" <i>Id.</i> at 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778. If congressional intent is clear, we \"must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\" <i>Id.</i> at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. \"[I]f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,\" however, we must consider \"whether the agency's [interpretation] is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\" <i>Id.</i> at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p>(a) <i>Whether Section 479 Is Ambiguous</i></p>\n<p>We begin our analysis with the statutory text. <i>Rucker v. Lee Holding Co.,</i> 471 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir.2006). The language at issue is that contained in 25 U.S.C. § 479, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote>The term \"Indian\" as used in this Act shall include all persons of Indian descent who are members of any recognized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction, and all persons who are descendants of such members who were, on June 1, 1934, residing within the present boundaries of any Indian reservation, and shall further include all other persons of one-half or more Indian blood.</blockquote>\n<p>One might have an initial instinct to read the word \"now\" in the statute as the State does, to mean the date of enactment of the statute, June 18, 1934. Congress certainly has used the word \"now\" in this way. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Montana v. Kennedy,</i> 366 U.S. 308, 312, 81 S.Ct. 1336, 6 L.Ed.2d 313 (1961) (interpreting the word \"now\" in a reenactment of an earlier act to refer to the initial date of enactment).</p>\n<p>Any such instinct quickly disappears upon further examination, however. This is not a case that can be resolved by looking to the plain meaning of the term \"now\" standing by itself. \"Now\" means \"at the present time,\" but there is ambiguity as to whether to view the term \"now\" as operating at the moment Congress enacted it or at the moment the Secretary invokes it. Indeed, Congress sometimes uses the word \"now\" to refer to a time other than the moment of enactment. <i>See</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> <i>Difford v. Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs.,</i> 910 F.2d 1316, 1320 (6th Cir.1990) (interpreting the word \"now\" in a disability benefits termination provision to refer to the time of the hearing); <i>see also </i><i>Pierce v. Pierce,</i> 287 N.W.2d 879, 882 (Iowa 1980) (noting that the phrase \"now hav[ing] jurisdiction\" in the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act \"refers to the time of the filing of the petition\"); <i>cf. </i><i>Williams v. Ragland,</i> 567 So.2d 63, 65-66 (La.1990) (declining to interpret \"now serving\" in a mandatory judicial retirement provision to refer to the date of enactment). There also are other layers of ambiguity.</p>\n<p>Given that the word \"now\" does not itself have a clear meaning, we must look to context. Here, the context is equivocal. On the one hand, the State points to 25 U.S.C. § 472, another provision of the IRA, which refers to \"positions maintained, now or hereafter, by the Indian Office.\" The State argues that this use of \"now\" unambiguously refers to the date of enactment and that had Congress wanted to include later-recognized tribes in section 479, it would have similarly added the words \"or hereafter.\"</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Secretary points out that section 479 itself specifies the date of \"June 1, 1934\" as the relevant date for determining eligibility based on \"residing within the present boundaries of any Indian reservation.\" The Secretary thus counters that had Congress wanted to require recognition of a tribe on the date of enactment, it would have specified that date, rather than using the term \"now.\" <i>See also</i> 25 U.S.C. § 478 (requiring elections to be held \"within one year after June 18, 1934\"). Hence, \"now\" might mean \"now or hereafter\" or it might mean \"June 18, 1934\"; either would be consistent with some other part of the statute.</p>\n<p>Policy does not provide an obvious answer either: each side has a plausible explanation that policy considerations favor its interpretation. The State argues that the principal, perhaps exclusive, concern of the 1934 statute was with remedying the perceived ills of the prior practice of allotment. <i>See </i><i>Kahawaiolaa v. Norton,</i> 222 F.Supp.2d 1213, 1220 n. 10 (D.Haw.2002). Because the IRA ended allotments in 1934, <i>see</i> 25 U.S.C. § 461, they would not have affected later-recognized tribes, and hence there would have been no reason to include such tribes within the ambit of the statute.</p>\n<p>The Secretary takes the view that the Act was intended not only to remedy past wrongs, but also to set a template for the future that would encourage the strength and stability of tribal communities. Based on this view, it would make no sense to distinguish among tribes based on the happenstance of their federal recognition status in 1934. The Secretary's view is buttressed by the fact that the Act contains a number of provisions that have nothing to do with land consolidation. <i>See id.</i> § 472 (Indian employment preference); <i>id.</i> § 476 (tribal organization).</p>\n<p>The State reads <i>United States v. John,</i> 437 U.S. 634, 98 S.Ct. 2541, 57 L.Ed.2d 489 (1978), to indicate that the Supreme Court had an initial interpretation of the Act that coincides with the State's interpretation. It is unclear if the Court had any such interpretation, and in any event, we find that <i>John</i> is not controlling here. In <i>John,</i> the Fifth Circuit had found that the Mississippi Choctaws were not eligible for benefits under the IRA because the tribe had not been recognized in 1934. <i>United States v. John,</i> 560 F.2d 1202, 1212 (5th Cir.1977); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Miss. Tax Comm'n,</i> 505 F.2d 633, 642 (5th Cir. 1974). The Supreme Court reversed, relying on a different clause in the statute and finding the tribe eligible for benefits under the IRA, but on the basis that its members <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> were \"persons of one-half or more Indian blood.\" 437 U.S. at 650, 98 S.Ct. 2541.</p>\n<p>Along the way, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>The 1934 Act defined \"Indians\" not only as \"all persons of Indian descent who are members of any recognized [in 1934] tribe now under Federal jurisdiction,\" and their descendants who then were residing on any Indian reservation, but also as \"all other persons of one-half or more Indian blood.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (alteration in original) (quoting 25 U.S.C. § 479 (1976)). The bracketed addition may be read to support the State's position, but the opinion contains no analysis on this point, and the Court rested its holding on an entirely separate provision of the Act, one not at issue here. We are mindful that the Supreme Court's musings may warrant our attention. <i>See </i><i>Rossiter v. Potter,</i> 357 F.3d 26, 31 n. 3 (1st Cir. 2004); <i>but see</i> P. Leval, <i>Judging Under the Constitution: Dicta About Dicta,</i> 81 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 1249 (2006). In this case, however, given <i>John's</i> complete lack of analysis of the provision that concerns us, the relevant language seems to us to fall short even of being dicta.</p>\n<p>Having found both text and context to be ambiguous, we turn to legislative history. Despite the State's arguments to the contrary, that history also does not clearly resolve the issue. Indeed, it suggests a reading of the phrase \"now under federal jurisdiction\" different from that offered by any of the parties, and is thus another source of ambiguity.</p>\n<p>The congressional record establishes that the phrase \"now under federal jurisdiction\" was specifically added to the statutory definition of \"Indian,\" a term defined separately from \"tribe.\" <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. § 479. The phrase was suggested by then-Commissioner of Indian Affairs John Collier in response to the concern that not all self-identified Indians deserved to benefit from the Act:</p>\n<blockquote>The Chairman. But the thing about it is this, Senator; I think you have to sooner or later eliminate those Indians who are at the present timeas I said the other day, you have a tribe of Indians here, for instance in northern California, several so-called \"tribes\" there. They are no more Indians than you or I, perhaps. I mean they are white people essentially. And yet they are under the supervision of the Government of the United States, and there is no reason for it at all, in my judgment. Their lands ought to be turned over to them in severalty and divided up and let them go ahead and operate their own property in their own way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Senator O'Mahoney. If I may suggest, that could be handled by some separate provision excluding from the benefits of the act certain types, but must have a general definition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Commissioner Collier. Would this not meet your thought, Senator: After the words \"recognized Indian tribe\" in line 1 insert \"now under Federal jurisdiction\"? That would limit the act to the Indians now under Federal jurisdiction, except that other Indians of more than one-half Indian blood would get help.</blockquote>\n<p><i>To Grant to Indians Living Under Federal Tutelage the Freedom To Organize for Purposes of Local Self-Government and Economic Enterprise: Hearing on S.2755 and S.3645 Before the S. Comm. on Indian Affairs,</i> 73d Cong. 266 (1934).</p>\n<p>Commissioner Collier offered the phrase as a limitation, but it is not clear whether it was intended as a temporal limitation. If the committee was concerned about the bona fides of an individual's status as an Indian and wanted to use the fact of federal jurisdiction to measure those bona fides, then there would have been no reason to distinguish between those under federal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> jurisdiction in 1934 and those who later came under federal jurisdiction. In fact, the colloquy quoted above suggests that the committee sought to exclude some Indians already \"under the supervision of the Government of the United States.\" If the purpose was to exclude those who might later be dropped from federal jurisdiction, it would make more sense to measure status as of the date benefits were sought, not as of the date of enactment of the statute.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the colloquy and the remainder of the hearing suggest that the committee was focused on the issue of <i>individual</i> Indians who received benefits from the federal government on the basis of a limited heritage and without acting as a part of a tribal community. Earlier in the session, the chairman had raised the case of a \"former Vice President of the United States,\" who was apparently receiving Indian benefits, asking, \"Why should the Government of the United States be managing the property of a lot of Indians who are practically white and hold office and do everything else, but in order to evade taxes or in order to do something else they come in under the Government supervision and control?\" <i>Id.</i> at 264.</p>\n<p>Thus, although none of the parties have raised this, it may well be that the phrase \"now under federal jurisdiction\" was intended to modify not \"recognized Indian tribe,\" but rather \"all persons of Indian descent.\" So interpreted, the purpose of the phrase might well have been to grandfather in those <i>individuals</i> already receiving federal benefits, but to otherwise insist that in the future, only individuals with at least one-half Indian blood would qualify. In that case, the limitation may well have been a temporal one, but the limitation, temporal or not, may have been intended to affect only the Secretary's authority to act for the benefit of an \"individual Indian,\" not an \"Indian tribe.\" <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. § 465 (\"Title to any lands or rights acquired pursuant to this Act . . . shall be taken in the name of the United States in trust for the <i>Indian tribe or individual Indian</i> for which the land is acquired. . . .\" (emphasis added)). After all, while Congress may have been concerned about misdirecting resources to individuals who were only Indians in name, the same concern would not apply to federally recognized tribes, regardless of the date of federal recognition. In any event, this piece of legislative history amply supports the view that the statute is at least ambiguous and leaves room for administrative interpretation.</p>\n<p>The other relevant piece of legislative history, heavily relied upon by the State, is the statement of Representative Edgar Howard, a cosponsor of the IRA:</p>\n<blockquote>For purposes of this act, [the definitional section] defines the persons who shall be classed as Indian. In essence, it recognizes the status quo of the present reservation Indians and further includes all other persons of one-fourth Indian blood. The latter provision is intended to prevent persons of less than one-fourth Indian blood who are already enrolled members of a tribe or descendants of such members living on a reservation from claiming financial and other benefits of the act. Obviously the line must be drawn somewhere . . .</blockquote>\n<p><i>Kahawaiolaa,</i> 222 F.Supp.2d at 1220 n. 10 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Congressional Debate on Wheeler-Howard Bill (1934) <i>in</i> III <i>The American Indian and the United States</i> (1973)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The State interprets the reference to \"status quo\" as supporting its view that federal recognition of tribes was essentially frozen for purposes of the IRA in 1934. This seems to be a misinterpretation of the quote, however. Representative Howard did not say that the Act would \"maintain\" or \"preserve\" the status quo; rather he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> stated that the Act would \"recognize\" it. Moreover, the quote refers not to Indian tribes, but to \"reservation Indians.\" Thus, in context, this sentence is more likely a reference to that portion of the definition of an Indian, not at issue here, that covers \"all persons who are descendants of such members who were, on June 1, 1934, residing within the present boundaries of any Indian reservation.\" 25 U.S.C. § 479. This provision, with its explicit reference to 1934, covered those people of Indian descent then living on a reservation, without regard to whether they might independently qualify as Indians under the Act. In that sense, the definition accepted and \"recognized\" the status quo of the reservations.</p>\n<p>Thus, we find from the text, context, and legislative history that section 479 is at least ambiguous as to whether the phrase \"now under federal jurisdiction\" disqualifies tribes that were federally recognized after 1934, such as the Narragansett Tribe, from the benefits of the IRA.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>(b) <i>Whether the Secretary's Interpretation Is Permissible</i></p>\n<p>As we have found the meaning of section 479 to be ambiguous, we must consider whether the Secretary's interpretation is \"permissible.\" <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. An interpretation is permissible if it is \"rational and consistent with the statute.\" <i>NLRB v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, Local 23,</i> 484 U.S. 112, 123, 108 S.Ct. 413, 98 L.Ed.2d 429 (1987). The Secretary's construction meets this test. As discussed above, it is reasonable and is consistent with the language and legislative history of the IRA. It also is consistent with the policy of the IRA, which, as we have indicated, may permissibly be viewed not only as intending to reverse the government's allotment policy, but also as affirmatively conferring benefits on Indians, including Indian employment preferences and a statutory right to organize and adopt governing documents.</p>\n<p>We therefore reject the State's argument that the text and purposes of the IRA prohibit the Secretary's interpretation of section 479. Rather, we find that the Secretary's construction of section 479 as allowing trust acquisitions for tribes that are recognized and under federal jurisdiction at the time of the trust application is entitled to deference.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Alleged Inconsistency of the Secretary's Interpretation</i></p>\n<p>The State makes a separate argument on which it heavily relies. It argues that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> the Secretary's interpretation of section 479 to allow trust acquisitions for tribes not federally recognized in 1934 represents a change in position as to the eligibility of tribes for IRA benefits, and that this interpretation therefore is not entitled to deference. The State relies particularly on historical practice, and says that the Secretary has never, or at least has hardly ever, identified as IRA-eligible a tribal entity that was not federally recognized in 1934 and does not meet the half-blood test. The evidence is limited with respect to whether the Secretary's interpretation of section 479 of the IRA has been consistent over the past seventy-three years.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>The consistency of the Secretary's construction is supported, though not directly, by a regulation promulgated by the Secretary in 1980. The regulation, found at 25 C.F.R. § 151.2, sets forth definitions that pertain to the regulations governing trust acquisitions. 25 C.F.R. § 151.2(b) defines a tribe that may be eligible for a trust acquisition as \"any Indian tribe, band, nation, pueblo, community, rancheria, colony, or other group of Indians . . . which is recognized by the Secretary as eligible for the special programs and services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\" The regulation does not distinguish between tribes recognized before June 18, 1934 and those recognized thereafter. Rather, it suggests that whether or not a group of Indians is considered a tribe, and therefore may be eligible to have land taken into trust, turns on a tribe's federal recognition status at the time a trust acquisition is requested.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Secretary's proffered interpretation of \"now\" as meaning \"today\" is consistent with regulations implementing other provisions of the IRA.<sup>[9]</sup> For example, the regulation implementing 25 U.S.C. § 466, which directs the Secretary to regulate the operation and management of Indian forestry units, states that it applies to \"any Indian tribe . . . which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.\" 25 C.F.R. § 163.1. Similarly, the regulation implementing 25 U.S.C. § 476, which allows eligible Indian tribes to organize and adopt constitutions and bylaws, defines eligibility in current terms: all Indian entities that have not voted to exclude themselves from the IRA and that are \"included, or [are] eligible to be included, among those tribes . . . recognized and receiving services from the [BIA]\" are eligible to organize under section 476. 25 C.F.R. § 81.1.</p>\n<p>As to the Secretary's trust acquisition practice, it is not seriously disputed that the Secretary has never <i>rejected</i> an application to take land into trust for a federally recognized tribe on the ground that the tribe was not recognized and under federal jurisdiction in 1934. Responding to the State's allegations about whose trust acquisition applications have been <i>granted,</i> the Secretary and Indian amici have submitted to us lists of tribes that they assert were not federally recognized in 1934 for whom land has since been taken into trust. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> The State disputes this evidence, arguing that nearly all of the identified tribes either have no trust lands, are not \"newly recognized\" because they were under federal jurisdiction in 1934, or have obtained legislation from Congress specifically permitting trust acquisitions on their behalf.</p>\n<p>The State's evidence of inconsistent practice is not persuasive. For example, although the State seems to concede that the Miccosukee Tribe was not recognized in 1934, it argues that the later trust acquisition for that tribe identified by Indian amici was made pursuant to specific statutory authorization, not section 465. But the statute to which the State points us, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1741-1750e, does not itself authorize acquisition of the parcel identified by Indian amici. Rather, it authorizes acquisition of a different parcel. Indeed, in taking the parcel identified by Indian amici into trust, the Secretary explicitly relied on his authority under section 465.</p>\n<p>Turning to a different distinction, the State argues that eight of the tribes identified by Indian amici were recognized and under federal jurisdiction in 1934 because they previously had signed treaties with the United States. It is not self-evident that simply because a tribe had signed a treaty with the U.S. government it necessarily was recognized and under federal jurisdiction in 1934; recognition as intended in section 479 requires an ongoing government-to-government relationship between a tribe and the United States. <i>See Cohen's Handbook of Federal Indian Law</i> § 3.02(3), at 138-40 (N.J. Newton et al., eds. 2005).</p>\n<p>Whether or not a treaty executed before 1934 has significance, however, the evidence is still that the Secretary has taken land into trust for tribes that did not <i>appear</i> to be federally recognized in 1934. We note two examples. The Secretary has taken land into trust for the Sault Ste. Marie Band of Chippewa Indians despite the Secretary's position that, regardless of prior treaties, the Band was not federally recognized in 1934. The Sault Ste. Marie Band is a successor to some of the Chippewa tribes that had signed treaties with the United States between 1785 and 1855. In addition, in 1855 the Band had signed two treaties with the United States. Despite those treaties, however, by 1917 the Department of the Interior did not recognize the Band as an entity with which it had government-to-government relations.

Andrus,</i> 532 F.Supp. 157, 161 (D.D.C.1980) (indicating that a period of non-recognition existed by stating that \"although the question of whether some groups qualified as Indian tribes for purposes of IRA benefits might have been unclear in 1934, that fact does not preclude the Secretary from subsequently determining that a given tribe deserved recognition in 1934\"). The State rejoins that the Department of the Interior cannot abrogate an Indian treaty. But the validity of the Department's treatment of the Sault Ste. Marie Band's status under the treaties is not the issue before us. What is important is the Department's position that the Band was not recognized and under federal jurisdiction in 1934. <i>Id.</i> at 16. Nevertheless, after 1934, the Secretary has invoked his section 465 authority to take land into trust for the Band.</p>\n<p>The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians provides a similar example. The Secretary has taken land into trust for the Grand Traverse Band, which the Department of the Interior ceased to recognize in 1872. The Grand Traverse Band signed the 1855 Treaty of Detroit with the United States. In 1872, however, the then-Secretary of the Interior severed the United States' relationship <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> with the Band and ceased to treat the Band as a federally recognized tribe. <i>Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa &amp; Chippewa Indians v. U.S. Attorney for the W. Dist. of Mich.,</i> 369 F.3d 960, 961 (6th Cir.2004); <i>see also </i><i>Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa &amp; Chippewa Indians v. U.S. Attorney for the W. Dist. of Mich.,</i> 198 F.Supp.2d 920, 924 (W.D.Mich.2002) (\"Between 1872 and 1980, the Band continually sought to regain its status as a federally recognized tribe.\"). Yet, the Secretary has invoked his authority under section 465 to take twenty-one parcels of land into trust for the Band.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>The State also concedes that the Secretary appears to have taken land into trust for two tribes, the Tunica-Biloxi Indian Tribe and the Narragansetts themselves, that were not under federal jurisdiction in 1934 and for whom Congress has passed no specific act authorizing trust acquisitions. Even if we had no reason to doubt the State's argument that the Secretary has not historically taken land into trust for tribes not recognized in 1934, however, in at least some cases the Secretary has not looked to the status of the tribe in 1934 or to the specific statutory authority identified by the State in making the determination to take land into trust. In <i>Baker v. Muskogee Area Dir.,</i> 19 I.B.I.A. 164 (1991), for example, the IBIA, in concluding that particular members of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma were eligible to have land taken into trust, did not rely on the 1936 Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 501-570, which authorized the Secretary to take land into trust for Indians in Oklahoma. Rather, the IBIA stated that the Indians \"c[a]me within the IRA definition because they are members of a recognized Indian tribe under Federal jurisdiction.\" 19 I.B.I.A. at 179. The Secretary thus seems to have <i>intended</i> to exercise his section 465 authority to take land into trust on the basis of current federal recognition.</p>\n<p>The State has not met its burden of showing inconsistent interpretation by the Secretary. Moreover, even if the State had shown that the Secretary has changed his interpretation of section 479 over time, that would not necessarily resolve the matter in the State's favor. The <i>Chevron</i> doctrine permits the Secretary some ability to alter his interpretation over time. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> <i>See </i><i>Nat'l Cable &amp; Telecomms. Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Servs.,</i> 545 U.S. 967, 981-82, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005) (under <i>Chevron,</i> an agency should have flexibility to vary its interpretation of a statute over time). The Secretary has given a reasoned explanation for his interpretation.</p>\n<p>We reject the State's argument that the Secretary has been inconsistent in his interpretation of section 479 and is therefore not entitled to deference.</p>\n<p>C. <i>The Settlement Act</i></p>\n<p>The State's next attack is to argue that the Settlement Act repealed the Secretary's trust authority as to all lands in Rhode Island. Alternatively, the State argues that the Settlement Act at least curtailed that authority so that any trust must preserve the State's civil and criminal jurisdiction over the Parcel.</p>\n<p>There is simply nothing in the text of the Settlement Act, however, that accomplishes such a repeal or curtailment of the Secretary's trust authority. 25 U.S.C. § 1708(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Except as otherwise provided in this [Act], the <i>settlement lands</i> shall be subject to the civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of the State of Rhode Island.</blockquote>\n<p>(emphasis added). The State would have us read the Act as if section 1708(a) applied to all lands the Tribe might ever acquire, either directly or as the beneficiary of a trust, but that is not what the section says. By its terms, section 1708(a) applies state law only to the 1800 acres of \"settlement lands.\" The Parcel is not part of the settlement lands. No other provision of the Settlement Act directly provides for state jurisdiction outside of the settlement lands. No language in the Act applies state law to lands the Tribe might later acquire. More importantly, no language explicitly curtails, or even references, the Secretary's power under the IRA to take lands into trust and thereby to create Indian country.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>The State's argument thus depends on finding that the Settlement Act <i>implicitly</i> repealed the IRA, at least in part.<sup>[12]</sup> The framework for evaluating such a claim of implicit repeal was set out by the Supreme Court in <i>Morton v. Mancari,</i> 417 U.S. 535, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974). First, we must look to affirmative manifestations of congressional intent to repeal the prior act, mindful of the \"cardinal rule . . . that repeals by implication are not favored.\" <i>Id.</i> at 549, 94 S.Ct. 2474 (omission in original) (quoting <i>Posadas v. Nat'l City Bank of N.Y.,</i> 296 U.S. 497, 503, 56 S.Ct. 349, 80 L.Ed. 351 (1936)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"In the absence of some affirmative showing of an intention <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> to repeal, the only permissible justification for [finding] a repeal by implication is [that] the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable.\" <i>Id.</i> at 550, 94 S.Ct. 2474. Such a conflict is not lightly to be found. \"[A]bsent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary,\" we must \"give effect to both [acts] if possible.\" <i>Id.</i> at 551, 94 S.Ct. 2474 (quoting <i>United States v. Borden Co.,</i> 308 U.S. 188, 198, 60 S.Ct. 182, 84 L.Ed. 181 (1939)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>A determination of congressional intent must be rooted in the text of the Act. Nothing in the Act explicitly curtails the Secretary's trust authority. The State offers two different lines of argument as to why provisions of the Act must be read to restrict that authority. One concerns how the Act affects the Tribe's rights; the other concerns how the Act affects the Secretary's authority. The provisions of the Settlement Act cited by the State, however, are most naturally read as merely resolving the claims that had clouded the titles of so much land in Rhode Island and that had led to the settlement embodied in the Act.</p>\n<p>As to the provisions affecting the Tribe, the State relies independently on the extinguishment of aboriginal title in 25 U.S.C. §§ 1705(a)(2) and 1712(a)(2) and the further extinguishment in sections 1705(a)(3) and 1712(a)(3) of \"all claims . . . based upon any interest in or right involving\" certain land or natural resources. These provisions, however, follow sections 1705(a)(1) and 1712(a)(1), respectively, which validate \"any transfer of land or natural resources\" in the United States by the Narragansett Tribe or in Rhode Island by any Indian tribe \"as of the date of said transfer.\"<sup>[13]</sup> The provisions then go on to state:</p>\n<blockquote>(2) [T]o the extent that any transfer of land or natural resources described in subsection (a) of this section may involve land or natural resources to which [an Indian tribe] had aboriginal title, subsection (a) of this section shall be regarded as an extinguishment of such aboriginal title as of the date of said transfer; and (3) by virtue of the approval of a transfer of land or natural resources effected by this section, or an extinguishment of aboriginal title effected thereby, all claims . . . by the [Narragansett Tribe], or any predecessor or successor in interest, member or stockholder thereof, or any other Indian, Indian nation, or tribe of Indians, arising subsequent to the transfer and based upon any interest in or right involving such land or natural resources (including but not limited to claims for trespass damages or claims for use and occupancy) shall be regarded as extinguished as of the date of the transfer.</blockquote>\n<p>25 U.S.C. § 1705(a). Given the references back to the transfers validated in paragraph (1), the evident purpose of these provisions is to extinguish claims based on the purported invalidity of those transfers.</p>\n<p>The State's arguments that the provisions should be read more broadly are unavailing. First, the State argues that the extinguishment of aboriginal title over land in Rhode Island precludes the later exercise of tribal sovereignty over Rhode Island land acquired by the Secretary in unrestricted trust. The Secretary disputes whether aboriginal title is ever the basis for tribal sovereignty, but in any event, it is clear that such title is not the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> only basis for tribal sovereignty. This is evident from the Supreme Court's decision in <i>City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation,</i> 544 U.S. 197, 125 S.Ct. 1478, 161 L.Ed.2d 386 (2005). In <i>Sherrill,</i> the Supreme Court both held that \"the Tribe [could not] unilaterally revive its ancient sovereignty, in whole or in part, over the parcels at issue,\" <i>id.</i> at 202-03, 125 S.Ct. 1478, and directed the Oneidas to 25 U.S.C. § 465 as \"the proper avenue for [the tribe] to reestablish sovereign authority over [the relevant] territory,\" <i>id.</i> at 221, 125 S.Ct. 1478. The State's protestation that <i>Sherrill</i> did not involve a statutory extinguishment of aboriginal title is beside the point. However aboriginal title or ancient sovereignty was lost, the IRA provides an alternative means of establishing tribal sovereignty over land.</p>\n<p>Trust acquisition is not incompatible with the extinguishment of aboriginal title. The Mashantucket Pequot Indian Claims Settlement Act, for example, contains virtually identical language extinguishing aboriginal title \"to any land or natural resources the transfer of which was approved and ratified\" by the Act. 25 U.S.C. § 1753(b). At the same time, the Act provides that certain land and natural resources \"located within the settlement lands shall be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Tribe,\" <i>id.</i> § 1754(b)(7), and that such lands are \"declared to be Indian country,\" <i>id.</i> §§ 1752(7), 1755. It is implausible to think that Congress intended the extinguishment of aboriginal title in the Rhode Island Settlement Act to preclude the taking of land into unrestricted trust, but did not intend for identical language in the Mashantucket Settlement Act to do so.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>Alternatively, the State argues that the \"all claims\" language in paragraph (3) even more broadly forecloses the assertion of tribal sovereignty over non-settlement lands. To hold otherwise, says the State, would render that language surplusage. Paragraphs (2) and (3) are complementary, however, not duplicative. While paragraph (2) extinguishes a form of title, paragraph (3) extinguishes claims. Moreover, paragraph (3) covers claims based on other forms of title, besides aboriginal title, that the Tribe might have held to land in Rhode Island prior to the Settlement Act.</p>\n<p>The State's broad interpretation of paragraph (3) proves too much. The State argues that the paragraph precludes an assertion of tribal sovereignty over any land in Rhode Island. Nothing in the language of the provision, which refers to \"any interest in or right involving\" such land, distinguishes between claims of sovereignty and traditional property claims. Indeed, the latter are explicitly included. <i>See id.</i> § 1705(a)(3) (\"including but not limited to claims for trespass damages or claims for use and occupancy\"). It would be highly improbable that Congress intended to prevent the Tribe from asserting any ownership interest over land it purchased outside the settlement lands, and it would be contradictory as to the settlement lands themselves. Thus, there is no support for reading this provision as precluding all future assertions of tribal sovereignty over land in Rhode Island.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this entire line of argument by the State misses the point that what is at issue is not what the <i>Tribe</i> may do in the exercise of its rights, but what the <i>Secretary</i> may do. The displacement of state law arises from the Secretary's authority and not from the Tribe's mere purchase <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> of the land. <i>See </i><i>Cass County, Minn. v. Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians,</i> 524 U.S. 103, 113-15, 118 S.Ct. 1904, 141 L.Ed.2d 90 (1998). In order to prevail on its claim of implied repeal, the State must show that the Settlement Act repeals the Secretary's authority under the IRA.</p>\n<p>As to the implied repeal of the Secretary's power, the State first argues that the Secretary is bound by the extinguishment of the Tribe's claims because that extinguishment binds the Tribe's \"successor in interest.\" 25 U.S.C. § 1705(a)(2), (3). Even if the Secretary is such a \"successor in interest,\" however, those provisions cannot plausibly be read to repeal the Secretary's power under the IRA to take land into trust. The Secretary's power does not turn on the Tribe's original aboriginal interest in the Parcel, before it purchased the land, nor does it turn on whether the Secretary is a successor in interest to the Tribe.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>The State also relies on 25 U.S.C. § 1707(c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Upon the discharge of the Secretary's duties under sections 1704, 1705, 1706, and 1707 of this title, the United States shall have no further duties or liabilities under this subchapter with respect to the Indian Corporation or its successor, the State Corporation, or the settlement lands. . . .</blockquote>\n<p>The language of this provision, however, cannot be read to have a preclusive effect or to limit the Secretary's powers in any way. The statement that the United States has \"no further duties or liabilities under this subchapter\" merely delimits the federal government's obligations in implementing the Settlement Act.</p>\n<p>We reject the State's suggestion that this language parallels the language in the Mashantucket Settlement Act that the Second Circuit found to prohibit certain trust acquisitions. <i>See </i><i>Connecticut ex rel. Blumenthal v. U.S. Dep't of Interior,</i> 228 F.3d 82, 88 (2d Cir.2000). The Mashantucket Settlement Act uses very different language that provides that \"the United States shall have no further trust responsibility with respect to [certain] land and natural resources\" outside of the settlement lands. 25 U.S.C. § 1754(b)(8). Disclaiming \"trust responsibility\" over land is nothing like disclaiming \"duties or liabilities under this subchapter.\"</p>\n<p>There is nothing in the text of the Settlement Act that clearly indicates an intent to repeal the Secretary's trust acquisition powers under the IRA, or that is fundamentally inconsistent with those powers.<sup>[16]</sup> This lack of language is not because either Congress or the parties failed to anticipate that the Tribe might later become federally recognized and eligible for the benefits of the IRA. The Settlement Act specifically provides for a restraint on alienation of the settlement lands \"if the Secretary subsequently acknowledges the existence of the Narragansett Tribe of Indians.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1707(c). The underlying <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> JMOU also explicitly recognized that the Tribe would \"not receive Federal recognition\" in the implementation of the settlement, but would \"have the same right to petition for such recognition . . . as other groups.\" JMOU para. 15.</p>\n<p>Had the Act intended to limit the Secretary's trust authority in case of federal recognition, it could have done so explicitly. It would have been easy to extend the provisions of section 1708(a) preserving state sovereignty to cover all lands in Rhode Island owned by or held in trust for the Tribe. No such language appears in the Act. Similarly, as the IBIA also noted, paragraph 15 of the JMOU would have been \"a logical place for the parties to set out any restrictions\" on the Secretary's trust authority following federal recognition of the Tribe. <i>Town of Charlestown,</i> 35 I.B.I.A. at 101. No such restrictions appear. Nor does the Settlement Act contemplate any role for the State to play in the Secretary's decision whether to take the land into trust. This is in contrast to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.</p>\n<p>In other settlement acts, Congress has specifically described limits on the Secretary's trust authority. In the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act, Congress expressly precluded application of section 465. 25 U.S.C. § 1724(e) (\"Except for the provisions of this [Act], the United States shall have no other authority to acquire lands or natural resources in trust for the benefit of Indians or Indian nations, or tribes, or bands of Indians in the State of Maine.\"). In the Mashantucket Settlement Act, Congress precluded the trust acquisition of non-settlement lands purchased with settlement funds. <i>See Blumenthal,</i> 228 F.3d at 88. The absence of any restrictions in the Settlement Act supports our finding that no restrictions were intended.<sup>[17]</sup><i>See id.</i> at 90.</p>\n<p>The State's fallback position is that the Settlement Act requires that this court order the Secretary to honor the intent of the bargain it believes is embodied in the Act by putting the Parcel into a restricted trust, subject to state laws and jurisdiction.<sup>[18]</sup> Acknowledging the genuineness of the State's sense that its bargain has been upset, we find that the relief it seeks is not an appropriate exercise of judicial power.</p>\n<p>In the Settlement Act, the State procured at least two clear benefits: (1) the settling of disputed land claims and (2) the application of its civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction to the settlement lands. Beyond that, the State argues that it would never have agreed to displacement of state law as to later acquired parcels if the issue had surfaced during the negotiations. The State argues that the practical consequences of the unrestricted trust leave it in an entirely unsatisfactory position and undermine the central bargain. Rhode Island points out that it is a small, very populous state and that the practical consequences of establishing Indian country for its nearby towns may be far greater <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> than they would be in less densely populated areas.</p>\n<p>Even so, we are still bound by the language of the Settlement Act. Even viewing the State's argument in contract terms, it is rare that a court will step in and reform a contract. <i>See </i><i>Broadley v. Mashpee Neck Marina, Inc.,</i> 471 F.3d 272, 275 (1st Cir.2006) (reversing the district court's reformation of a contract). Our ability to edit, as opposed to interpret, an act of Congress is no less constrained: only a finding of absurdity, not present here, provides the necessary precondition. <i>Compare </i><i>Green v. Bock Laundry Mach. Co.,</i> 490 U.S. 504, 510-11, 109 S.Ct. 1981, 104 L.Ed.2d 557 (1989) (editing a federal rule of evidence where the apparent distinction between civil plaintiffs and civil defendants would be \"unfathomable\"), <i>with </i><i>W. Va. Univ. Hosps. v. Casey,</i> 499 U.S. 83, 100-01, 111 S.Ct. 1138, 113 L.Ed.2d 68 (1991) (refusing to read in an additional component to a fee-shifting provision on the basis that Congress \"simply forgot\" to include it). <i>See also Blumenthal,</i> 228 F.3d at 91 (\"While we might question the wisdom of different jurisdictional provisions governing different trust lands, we will not provide a strained interpretation of the Settlement Act simply to avoid such a result.\"). The judiciary may not usurp the role of Congress.</p>\n<p>D. <i>Constitutional Claims</i></p>\n<p>In support of recognition of its state sovereignty interests under the Constitution, the State presents four arguments. It argues first that the Indian Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3, does not provide the Secretary the authority to displace state law within a state's boundaries, and that section 465 of the IRA therefore violates the Tenth Amendment. Next, it argues that the Secretary may not, in any event, displace state law without the State's consent, by operation of the Enclave Clause of the Constitution. <i>Id.</i> art. I, § 8, cl. 17. The State further argues that the Secretary's action is barred by the Admissions Clause, <i>id.</i> art. IV, § 3, cl. 1, which prohibits formation of new states within the jurisdiction of any other state. Finally, the State argues that section 465 is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. We reject all of these arguments.</p>\n<p>1. <i>The Indian Commerce Clause and the Tenth Amendment</i></p>\n<p>The authority to regulate Indian affairs is within the enumerated powers of the federal government. <i>Id.</i> art. I, § 8, cl. 3; <i>Cotton Petroleum Corp.,</i> 490 U.S. at 192, 109 S.Ct. 1698 (\"[T]he central function of the Indian Commerce Clause is to provide Congress with plenary power to legislate in the field of Indian affairs.\"); <i>Morton,</i> 417 U.S. at 551, 94 S.Ct. 2474 (noting that Congress has plenary power \"to deal with the special problems of Indians,\" including the power to legislate on their behalf). \"With the adoption of the Constitution, Indian relations became the exclusive province of federal law.\" <i>County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y.,</i> 470 U.S. 226, 234, 105 S.Ct. 1245, 84 L.Ed.2d 169 (1985); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Forty-Three Gallons of Whiskey,</i> 93 U.S. 188, 194, 23 L.Ed. 846 (1876) (\"Congress now has the exclusive and absolute power to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes. . . . \").</p>\n<p>The Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reserves to the states those powers not expressly delegated to the federal government. The powers delegated to the federal government and those reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment are mutually exclusive. \"If a power is delegated to Congress in the Constitution, the Tenth Amendment expressly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> disclaims any reservation of that power to the States. . . .\" <i>New York v. United States,</i> 505 U.S. 144, 156, 112 S.Ct. 2408, 120 L.Ed.2d 120 (1992). Because Congress has plenary authority to regulate Indian affairs, section 465 of the IRA does not offend the Tenth Amendment. <i>Cf. </i><i>Herrera-Inirio v. INS,</i> 208 F.3d 299, 307 (1st Cir.2000) (\"Because Congress possesses plenary authority over immigration-related matters, it may freely displace or preempt state laws in respect to such matters.\").</p>\n<p>2. <i>The Enclave Clause</i></p>\n<p>The Enclave Clause of the Constitution provides that Congress may \"exercise exclusive legislation . . . over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other needful buildings.\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 17. The Enclave Clause's provision for exclusive federal jurisdiction was intended to ensure that \"places on which the security of the entire Union may depend\" are not \"in any degree dependent on a particular member of it.\" <i>Fort Leavenworth R.R. Co. v. Lowe,</i> 114 U.S. 525, 530, 5 S.Ct. 995, 29 L.Ed. 264 (1885) (quoting <i>The Federalist</i> No. 43 (James Madison)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The State argues that \"[p]rimary federal jurisdiction through federal superintendence over the land . . . coupled with Congress's exclusive legislative authority over Indian matters . . . collectively operate to exclude state law [on trust lands].\" As a result, it argues, trust acquisitions create federal enclaves and therefore require state consent.</p>\n<p>We disagree. First, trust land does not fall within the plain language of the Enclave Clause. It is not purchased \"for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, [or] other needful buildings.\" Rather, it is held in trust for the benefit of Indians.</p>\n<p>Second, in <i>Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook,</i> 281 U.S. 647, 50 S.Ct. 455, 74 L.Ed. 1091 (1930), the Supreme Court offered an Indian reservation as a \"typical illustration\" of federally owned land that is not a federal enclave because state civil and criminal laws may still have partial application thereon. <i>Id.</i> at 651, 50 S.Ct. 455. The Supreme Court recently confirmed the reasoning underlying the observation that Indian lands are not federal enclaves:</p>\n<blockquote>Indians' right to make their own laws and be governed by them does not exclude all state regulatory authority on the reservation. State sovereignty does not end at a reservation's border. Though tribes are often referred to as \"sovereign\" entities, it was \"long ago\" that \"the Court departed from Chief Justice Marshall's view that `the laws of [a State] can have no force' within reservation boundaries.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Hicks,</i> 533 U.S. at 361, 121 S.Ct. 2304 (alteration in original) (quoting <i>White Mountain Apache Tribe,</i> 448 U.S. at 141, 100 S.Ct. 2578 (quoting <i>Worcester v. Georgia,</i> 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515, 561, 8 L.Ed. 483 (1832))). As a result, the Secretary's trust acquisition of lands for the Narragansetts does not even implicate the Enclave Clause.</p>\n<p>3. <i>The Admissions Clause</i></p>\n<p>The Admissions Clause of the Constitution provides that \"no new state shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states, or parts of states, without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the Congress.\" U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 1. The State argues that the creation of Indian country within Rhode Island <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> amounts to the formation of a new state within Rhode Island's jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>This argument is without merit. The Admissions Clause prohibits Congress only from unilaterally establishing within an existing state a body \"on an equal footing with the original states in all respects whatsoever.\" <i>Coyle v. Smith,</i> 221 U.S. 559, 567, 31 S.Ct. 688, 55 L.Ed. 853 (1911) (internal quotation marks omitted). For purposes of the Admissions Clause, a state is a body \"equal in power, dignity and authority\" to existing states. <i>Id.</i> The Secretary's trust acquisition for the Narragansetts does not establish such a body. As a result, the acquisition does not violate the Admissions Clause.</p>\n<p>4. <i>The Nondelegation Doctrine</i></p>\n<p>The Constitution vests \"[a]ll legislative Powers [t]herein granted . . . in a Congress of the United States.\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 1. Congress \"is not permitted to abdicate, or to transfer to others, the essential legislative functions with which it is . . . vested.\" <i>Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan,</i> 293 U.S. 388, 421, 55 S.Ct. 241, 79 L.Ed. 446 (1935). Yet, the Supreme Court has recognized that \"in our increasingly complex society, replete with ever changing and more technical problems, Congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives.\" <i>Mistretta v. United States,</i> 488 U.S. 361, 372, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989). As a result, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that Congress may confer decisionmaking authority on agencies as long as it \"lay[s] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [act] is directed to conform.\" <i>Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass'ns,</i> 531 U.S. 457, 472, 121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001) (second alteration in original) (quoting <i>J.W. Hampton, Jr., &amp; Co. v. United States,</i> 276 U.S. 394, 409, 48 S.Ct. 348, 72 L.Ed. 624 (1928)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court \"has deemed it `constitutionally sufficient if Congress clearly delineates the general policy, the public agency which is to apply it, and the boundaries of this delegated authority.'\" <i>Mistretta,</i> 488 U.S. at 372-73, 109 S.Ct. 647 (quoting <i>Am. Power &amp; Light Co. v. SEC,</i> 329 U.S. 90, 105, 67 S.Ct. 133, 91 L.Ed. 103 (1946)).</p>\n<p>The State and its amici argue that section 465 lacks the requisite \"intelligible principle\" and therefore is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</p>\n<p>25 U.S.C. § 465 provides:</p>\n<blockquote>The Secretary of the Interior is authorized, in his discretion, to acquire . . . any interest in lands, . . . for the purpose of providing land for Indians.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>For the acquisition of such lands, . . . and for expenses incident to such acquisition, there is authorized to be appropriated, out of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, a sum not to exceed $2,000,000 in any one fiscal year: Provided, That no part of such funds shall be used to acquire additional land outside of the exterior boundaries of Navajo Indian Reservation for the Navajo Indians in Arizona, nor in New Mexico, in the event that legislation to define the exterior boundaries of the Navajo Indian Reservation in New Mexico . . . becomes law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Title to any lands or rights acquired pursuant to this Act . . . shall be taken in the name of the United States in trust for the Indian tribe or individual Indian for which the land is acquired, and such lands or rights shall be exempt from State and local taxation.</blockquote>\n<p>25 U.S.C. § 465.</p>\n<p>In support of its argument, the State relies primarily on an Eighth Circuit decision, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> <i>South Dakota v. U.S. Dep't of the Interior,</i> 69 F.3d 878 (8th Cir.1995), <i>vacated,</i> 519 U.S. 919, 117 S.Ct. 286, 136 L.Ed.2d 205 (1996), that held that section 465 was an impermissible delegation that was completely lacking in \"boundaries\" and \"intelligible principles\" and that \"would permit the Secretary to purchase the Empire State Building in trust for a tribal chieftain as a wedding present.\" <i>Id.</i> at 882. The circuit opinion in <i>South Dakota</i> was vacated by the Supreme Court, which did not publish an opinion explaining its decision, 519 U.S. at 919-20, 117 S.Ct. 286, and as a result has not set any precedent. <i>Lovelace v. Se. Mass. Univ.,</i> 793 F.2d 419, 422 (1st Cir.1986) (per curiam).</p>\n<p>On remand, the Eighth Circuit held that \"the purposes evident in the whole of the IRA and its legislative history sufficiently narrow the delegation and guide the Secretary's discretion in deciding when to take land into trust.\"<sup>[19]</sup><i>South Dakota v. U.S. Dep't of Interior,</i> 423 F.3d 790, 797 (8th Cir.2005). The court noted that the statute allows the Secretary to acquire trust lands only for Indians as defined in 25 U.S.C. § 479, and that the statute prohibits the Secretary from taking extra-reservation lands into trust for Navajo Indians. <i>See</i> 423 F.3d at 797. The <i>South Dakota</i> court also referred to the legislative history of the IRA,<sup>[20]</sup> which explains that the goals motivating trust acquisitions are \"rehabilitati[on][of] the Indian's economic life\" and \"develop[ment] [of] the initiative destroyed by . . . oppression and paternalism.\" <i>Id.</i> at 798 (quoting <i>Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones,</i> 411 U.S. 145, 152, 93 S.Ct. 1267, 36 L.Ed.2d 114 (1973) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 73-1804, at 6-7 (1934))) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the dissent from the original <i>South Dakota</i> decision had noted, the historical context of the IRA is important; section 465's \"direction that land be acquired `for the purpose of providing land for Indians[]' has specific meaning in light of the failure of the allotment policy and [c]ongressional rejection of assimilation as a goal.\" 69 F.3d at 887 (Murphy, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>Other provisions of the IRA reinforce such an interpretation. <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. § 461 (prohibiting allotment of reservation lands to individual Indians); <i>id.</i> § 462 (extending indefinitely existing trust periods and restrictions on alienation of Indian lands); <i>id.</i> § 463(a) (authorizing restoration of surplus lands to tribal ownership); <i>id.</i> § 464 (prohibiting the transfer of restricted Indian lands except to Indian tribes). We find the reasoning of the Eighth Circuit's second <i>South Dakota</i> opinion persuasive.</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit's decision in <i>Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Oregon v. United States,</i> 110 F.3d 688 (9th Cir.1997), also supports the Secretary's position that section 465 is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. Although not addressing a nondelegation challenge to section 465, the <i>Confederated Tribes</i> court stated that \"[t]he general delegation of power to the Executive to take land into trust for the Indians is a valid delegation because Congress has decided under what <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> circumstances land should be taken into trust and has delegated to the Secretary of the Interior the task of deciding when this power should be used.\" <i>Id.</i> at 698.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of statutes authorizing regulation in the \"public interest,\" <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Nat'l Broad. Co. v. United States,</i> 319 U.S. 190, 225-26, 63 S.Ct. 997, 87 L.Ed. 1344 (1943); <i>N.Y. Cent. Sec. Corp. v. United States,</i> 287 U.S. 12, 24-25, 53 S.Ct. 45, 77 L.Ed. 138 (1932), as well as statutes authorizing regulation to ensure fairness and equity, <i>see </i><i>Am. Power &amp; Light Co.,</i> 329 U.S. at 104-05, 67 S.Ct. 133; <i>Yakus v. United States,</i> 321 U.S. 414, 420, 426-27, 64 S.Ct. 660, 88 L.Ed. 834 (1944). As the Court stated in its most recent nondelegation decision, it has \"almost never felt qualified to second-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree of policy judgment that can be left to those executing or applying the law.\" <i>Am. Trucking Ass'ns,</i> 531 U.S. at 474-75, 121 S.Ct. 903 (quoting <i>Mistretta,</i> 488 U.S. at 416, 109 S.Ct. 647 (Scalia, J., dissenting)) (internal quotation marks omitted). We similarly decline to do so here. We hold that section 465 is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</p>\n<p>E. <i>APA-Related Claims</i></p>\n<p>The focus of the en banc proceedings was on the three sets of arguments discussed above. The State presented another set of claims, rejected by the panel, that the Secretary's decision to take the Parcel into trust for the Tribe violates the APA. The State did not seek en banc review of this issue. In granting en banc review, we withdrew our panel opinion, which had been reported at 423 F.3d 45. In the interests of completeness, we now also reject the State's APA claims.</p>\n<p>We set forth here a shortened and slightly modified version of the panel's opinion as to this issue.</p>\n<p>The State claims that the Secretary's action was an abuse of discretion under the APA. Our review of the Secretary's decision is governed by section 706(2)(A) of the APA, which provides that a court may set aside agency action only where it finds the action \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). An agency's determination is arbitrary and capricious if the agency lacks a rational basis for making the determination or if the decision was not based on consideration of the relevant factors. <i>See </i><i>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,</i> 463 U.S. 29, 43, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983); <i>Associated Fisheries of Me., Inc. v. Daley,</i> 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir.1997). The Court's review under section 706(2)(A) is highly deferential, and the Secretary's action is presumed to be valid. <i>See </i><i>Conservation Law Found. of New Eng., Inc. v. Sec'y of Interior,</i> 864 F.2d 954, 957-58 (1st Cir.1989). A reviewing court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the agency. <i>Citizens To Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe,</i> 401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971); <i>Associated Fisheries,</i> 127 F.3d at 109. No deference is given to the district court's decision. <i>Associated Fisheries,</i> 127 F.3d at 109.</p>\n<p>The State makes five arguments as to why the Secretary's decision was unlawful under section 706(2)(A): (1) the BIA relied on the Tribe's findings, rather than conducting an independent evaluation of the Tribe's application; (2) the BIA misapplied the factors enumerated in 25 C.F.R. § 151.10 for evaluating a fee-to-trust transfer; (3) the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> Act cooperation agreement waiver violated due process; (4) the BIA failed to consider the environmental impact of the housing project planned for the Parcel and the project's compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act; and (5) the BIA failed to consider noncompliance with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. We disagree, and we find that the Secretary's decision to accept the Parcel into trust did not violate the APA.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Independent Evaluation of the Tribe's Trust Application</i></p>\n<p>The State claims that the BIA's decision to take the Parcel into trust was arbitrary and capricious because it relied exclusively on the Tribe's assertions and failed to consider other important facts that occurred between 1993 and 1997. The State points to substantial passages in the Secretary's decision that contain verbatim restatements of information provided by the Narragansett Tribe in support of their 1993 trust application as evidence that the BIA failed to conduct an independent evaluation of the Tribe's 1997 application.</p>\n<p>There is ample evidence in the administrative record that the BIA conducted its own, independent evaluation of the Tribe's application and that it considered the events following the Tribe's 1993 application. For example, between 1993 and 1997, the BIA required the Tribe to supplement its initial Environmental Assessment; conducted an environmental hazard survey of the Parcel; required confirmation of consistency with the State's Coastal Resources Management Plan; was apprised of, and offered to facilitate, negotiations between the Tribe, the Town, and the State concerning both environmental and jurisdictional issues attendant to the Tribe's development of the Parcel; and specifically requested that the Regional Solicitor address several legal and jurisdictional issues raised by the State in its comments to the BIA on the Tribe's trust application. This demonstrates that the BIA's determination was the result of its own, independent evaluation of the 1997 application.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Application of the 25 C.F.R. § 151.10 Factors</i></p>\n<p>The State claims that the BIA failed to apply the proper criteria when it evaluated the Tribe's application for trust acquisition. The regulations governing the BIA's evaluation of applications to have land taken in trust are laid out at 25 C.F.R. part 151. The factors to be considered for an on-reservation acquisition are found in section 151.10, and the factors for an off-reservation acquisition are found in section 151.11.<sup>[21]</sup> In making the decision to accept the Parcel into trust, the BIA considered the on-reservation factors in section 151.10.<sup>[22]</sup> The State claims that the BIA <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> failed to consider \"the need of . . . the tribe for additional land,\" 25 C.F.R. § 151.10(b). The State also questions whether the BIA sufficiently scrutinized \"the tribe's justification of anticipated benefits from the acquisition\" as required by section 151.11(b).<sup>[23]</sup></p>\n<p>A reviewing court will determine only \"whether the [BIA's] decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\" <i>Citizens To Preserve Overton Park,</i> 401 U.S. at 416, 91 S.Ct. 814. The fact that the BIA found the Parcel, which is across a town road from the settlement lands, to be \"contiguous\" to the settlement lands that are currently in trust, and thus determined that it should consider the \"on-reservation\" factors enumerated in 25 C.F.R. § 151.10, is certainly not clear error and is within the Secretary's discretion. The record shows that the BIA complied with section 151.10, including evaluating the Tribe's need for the additional land, and the State has not shown that the Secretary made a clear error of judgment.</p>\n<p>It was not necessary for the BIA to consider the factors under section 151.11, since it found section 151.10 to be applicable to this trust determination. While the Secretary need not have considered section 151.11(b), the close proximity between the Tribe's settlement lands and the Parcel would not have required the Secretary to give the greatest scrutiny to the \"tribe's justification of anticipated benefits from the acquisition.\" 25 C.F.R. § 151.11(b).</p>\n<p>3. <i>The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act Cooperation Agreement Requirement</i></p>\n<p>At the time of the BIA's decision to acquire the Parcel into trust, HUD was precluded from releasing funds pursuant to the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act for any tribe's housing development unless an agreement for local cooperation on issues such as taxes and jurisdiction had been entered into by the tribe and the local government where the housing was located. 25 U.S.C. § 4111(c). In the instant case, the Narragansett Tribe did not obtain such an agreement with the Town. However, section 4111(c) has since been amended to permit HUD to waive the cooperation agreement requirement, 25 U.S.C. § 4111(c), <i>as amended by</i> Pub.L. No. 106-569, § 503(a)(2), 114 Stat. 2944, 2962 (2000), and the Tribe claims to have obtained such a waiver.</p>\n<p>The State argues that this waiver is invalid because the State apparently did not receive notice of the Tribe's application for a waiver until after the waiver had been granted. On appeal, the State contends that if the BIA accepted the waiver, the BIA has inherited the legal error and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner. As the district court noted, \"25 U.S.C. § 4111(c) establishes a prerequisite to HUD's award of housing grants. It does not pertain to the BIA's trust acquisition authority.\" <i>Carcieri,</i> 290 F.Supp.2d at 178. Nothing in the § 151.10 factors requires the BIA to ensure that a local cooperation agreement is in place for an Indian Housing project.</p>\n<p>4. <i>Environmental Considerations</i></p>\n<p>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321-4370(f), and its supporting regulations promulgated by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), 40 C.F.R. parts 1500-1518, direct federal agencies to consider the environmental impact of agency decisions. The State argues that the Secretary and the BIA (1) failed to consider the environmental impact in reaching the decision to accept the Parcel into trust because no Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was prepared, and (2) failed to conduct their own evaluation of the environmental impact and instead improperly relied on an Environmental Assessment (EA) submitted by the Narragansett Tribe. We disagree.</p>\n<p>Federal agencies are required to prepare an EIS for any action that could significantly affect the quality of the human environment. 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C); 40 C.F.R. § 1502.3. NEPA provides that \"to the fullest extent possible . . . all agencies of the Federal Government shall . . . include in every recommendation or report on proposals for . . . major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on . . . the environmental impact of the proposed action.\" 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C). However, in the absence of a finding that the proposed action would significantly affect the quality of the human environment, the BIA was not required to prepare an EIS. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Londonderry Neighborhood Coal. v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm'n,</i> 273 F.3d 416, 419 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>Wyo. Outdoor Council v. U.S. Forest Serv.,</i> 165 F.3d 43, 49 (D.C.Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p>The CEQ has issued guidance on whether to prepare an EIS. This guidance provides that \"if the agency determines on the basis of the environmental assessment not to prepare a statement,\" then the agency should \"[p]repare a finding of no significant impact\" pursuant to section 1508.13. 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(e). The applicant may prepare the EA provided that the agency \"make[s] its own evaluation of the environmental issues and take[s] responsibility for the scope and content of the environmental assessment.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1506.5(b). In this case, the BIA followed its standard operating procedure for externally initiated proposals by obtaining an EA from the Tribe and considering it along with supplemental information the BIA requested from the Tribe and information gathered independently by the BIA. <i>See NEPA Handbook</i> para. 4.2.B. After reviewing the EA and the requisite supplemental information, the BIA completed its environmental analysis and issued a finding of no significant impact. The BIA's issuance of a finding of no significant impact satisfied its responsibilities under NEPA. <i>See</i> 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(e).</p>\n<p>Separately, the State contends that the BIA should have obtained a federal consistency review in accordance with the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), 16 U.S.C. §§ 1451-1465, before making its trust determination. The CZMA requires state consultation on federally permitted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> coastal development activities.<sup>[24]</sup> The State asserts that the BIA's failure to take direct action to ensure that the housing project was consistent with the Rhode Island Coastal Zone Management Program (RICZMP) before making its trust determination was a violation of the CZMA. We disagree.</p>\n<p>The State has failed to demonstrate that a consistency review of the Tribe's housing development was necessary at the trust acquisition stage. The development of the Parcel is a project that was commenced by the Tribe, in conjunction with HUD, prior to the Tribe's application for trust acquisition. The Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council correctly recognized that the development of the Parcel, which required its own federal consistency determination, was a separate matter from the trust acquisition, and properly found that the Tribe's application for trust status was consistent with the RICZMP.</p>\n<p>5. <i>The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act</i></p>\n<p>Finally, the State contends that the true purpose of the Tribe's application for trust acquisition is the development of gambling facilities on the Parcelrather than development of tribal housing as the BIA found in its evaluation pursuant to 25 C.F.R. § 151.10(c)and that the BIA's failure to consider the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 2701-2721, in its decision was an abuse of discretion. We reject the State's argument that the Secretary's decision to acquire the Parcel in trust should be reversed and that further inquiry into whether the Parcel would be used for gaming purposes is now required.</p>\n<p>No evidence that the Tribe intends to use the Parcel for anything other than tribal housing, as determined by the BIA, was presented. \"In fact, after the plaintiffs expressed concern over the potential for development of a gaming facility on the parcel, the tribe reaffirmed that it intended to use the parcel for a housing development and stated that it had `no immediate plans for any further future development.'\" <i>Carcieri,</i> 290 F.Supp.2d at 178 (quoting II Admin. Rec., tab N).</p>\n<p>As support for its position, the State points to an IBIA decision that reversed a trust acquisition decision due to the BIA's failure to consider the impact of a potential casino, even though the applicants denied any intention of using the property for a casino. <i>See </i><i>Vill. of Ruidoso, N.M. v. Albuquerque Area Dir., Bureau of Indian Affairs,</i> 32 I.B.I.A. 130 (1998). However, in <i>Village of Ruidoso,</i> the IBIA determined that, despite the tribe's denial that the application for trust acquisition was for gaming purposes, it was clear from the planned gaming-related uses of the property and the fact that the property had been given to the tribe by a company that the BIA \"apparently understood to have some gaming connection with the Tribe\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> that the application might well have been for gaming purposes. <i>Id.</i> at 136. In that situation, the BIA should have further analyzed the possibility of gaming. <i>Id.</i> at 140.</p>\n<blockquote>We agree with the district court that</blockquote>\n<blockquote>although the possibility that the parcel might be used for gaming activities was raised before the BIA, the bureau's determination that the parcel would be used to provide housing was amply supported by the record. In view of the deferential standard of review afforded to agency decisions under the APA, the bureau's determination in this regard must be sustained.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Carcieri,</i> 290 F.Supp.2d at 178.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The decision of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i> Costs are awarded to the Secretary.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Respectfully, I disagree with the majority's analysis of the Settlement Act. In my view, the majority opinion disregards Congress's (and the parties') purpose in passing the Settlement Act and is inconsistent with our own recent interpretation of the Settlement Act. <i>See </i><i>Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Rhode Island,</i> 449 F.3d 16 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc). At bottom, under the Settlement Act, the Secretary may only take the Parcel into a restricted trust<sup>[25]</sup> that provides for Rhode Island's continued criminal and civil jurisdiction over the Parcel. The State makes this argument in two forms. First, by arguing that the Settlement Act effectuates a partial implied repeal of the IRA as to state jurisdiction on land taken into trust by the BIA. Second, by arguing that the statutes can be harmonized by reading the IRA narrowly and subject to the Settlement Act's provisions. Either approach gets to the same conclusion. Significantly, the generous rules of \"Indian construction\" do not apply in analyzing an implied repeal. <i>See </i><i>Passamaquoddy Tribe v. State of Maine,</i> 75 F.3d 784, 790 (1st Cir.1996) (the normal principles of implied repeal are applied in the Indian law context).</p>\n<p>The parties and amici do an excellent job in acquainting the court with the many complexities of both the case and the issues inherent in \"Indian law.\" However, the ultimate resolution of the case comes down to a very narrow question: In the specific context of the Tribe and State, what did Congress intend the Settlement Act to do?</p>\n<p>The key provision is Section 1705, which is written far more broadly than the majority concludes.<sup>[26]</sup> In its first two provisions that section retroactively ratifies all the Tribe's prior land transfers anywhere in the United States and extinguishes the Tribe's aboriginal title in all such lands. <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. § 1705(a)(1) &amp; (2). More significantly, Section 1705 goes on to extinguish future land claims:</p>\n<blockquote>(3)by virtue of the approval of a transfer of land or natural resources effected by this section, or an extinguishment of aboriginal title effected thereby, all claims against the United States, any State or subdivision thereof, or any other person or entity, by the Indian Corporation or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> any other entity presently or at any time in the past known as the Narragansett Tribe of Indians, or any predecessor or successor in interest, member of stockholder thereof, or any other Indian, Indian nation, or tribe of Indians, arising subsequent to the transfer and based upon any interest in or right involving such land or natural resources (including but not limited to claims for trespass damages or claims for use and occupancy) shall be regarded as extinguished as of the date of the transfer.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 1705(a)(3). This provision obviously goes well beyond merely extinguishing aboriginal title (and claims based thereon), which was accomplished in the prior subsection. <i>See id.</i> § 1705(a)(2). This language forecloses any future \"Indian\" land claim of any type by the Tribe regarding land in Rhode Island (or anywhere in the United States, for that matter). Thus, Congress (and the parties) intended to resolve all the Tribe's land claims in the state once and for all.</p>\n<p>The majority argues that Section 1705(a)(3) cannot be read so broadly; otherwise, the Tribe would be barred from asserting any land claims. <i>See ante,</i> at 36-37. But the majority disregards a significant factorthe nature of the land claims that were barred. The legislative history of the Settlement Act specifically states that the \"extinguishment of Indian land claims is limited to those claims raised by Indians qua Indians.\" H.R. Rep. 95-1453, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, 1948, at 1955 (1978) (emphasis added). As we recently stated, through the Settlement Act \"the Tribe abandoned any right to an autonomous enclave, submitting itself to state law as a quid pro quo for obtaining the land that it cherished.\" <i>Narragansett Tribe,</i> 449 F.3d at 22. Thus, the Tribe would be free to assert any claim that any other landowner in Rhode Island could make under state law, but would be foreclosed from making claims based entirely on the Tribe's status as an Indian tribe. It is beyond peradventure that asking to have land taken into trust by the BIA under the IRA to effect an ouster of state jurisdiction is a quintessential \"Indian\" land claim.<sup>[27]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, \"Congress does not legislate in a vacuum,\" and among the matters that a court must consider in assessing a statute are general policies and pre-existing statutory provisions. <i>Passamaquoddy Tribe,</i> 75 F.3d at 789. The Settlement Act was enacted over 40 years after Section 465 of the IRA and, given the explicit acknowledgment of possible future recognition for the Tribe,<sup>[28]</sup> Congress was well aware of the IRA when enacting the Settlement Act. It is neither logical nor necessary to find that Congress enacted legislation effectuating this carefully calibrated compromise between three sovereigns, which required significant expenditures by both the federal government and the State, which provided a significant amount of land to the Tribe, and which provided for a delicate balancing of the parties' interests, only to permit the legislation to be completely subverted by subsequent agency action.</p>\n<p>On this score, the majority misses the exquisite irony that the Parcel was part of the lands originally claimed by the Tribe. It would be antithetical to Congress' intent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> to allow the Tribe to purchase a portion of the originally disputed lands that were the subject of the earlier lawsuits that ultimately led to the JMOU and Settlement Act, place it in trust with the BIA, and thereby create \"Indian country\" in direct contravention of the Settlement Act's prohibitions. For this same reason, the majority's attempt to distinguish our recent <i>Narragansett Tribe</i> opinion as pertaining only to the \"Settlement Lands\" is unpersuasive. <i>See ante,</i> at 34 n. 11. By that reasoning, the Tribe could swap the Settlement Lands for adjacent land and undo any limitations contained in the Settlement Act. The Settlement Act cannot be reasonably construed to allow such absurd results.</p>\n<p>Further, the Settlement Act was novel; it was the first statute resolving Indian land claims, premised upon the Nonintercourse Act, growing out of an out-of-court settlement negotiated by a tribe and the state/landowners. <i>See</i> H.R. 95-1453, at 1951 (1978). Indeed, it was expected to serve as a template for the resolution of other Eastern tribes' land claims under the Nonintercourse Act. <i>See id.; see also </i><i>Oneida Indian Nation,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 1483-85 (discussing Nonintercourse Act and original 13 states' \"pre-emptive right to purchase from the Indians\"). In light of the fact that the Settlement Act was the first statute of its kind, the majority's observation that subsequent statutes were more explicit in limiting certain aspects of the Secretary's power proves nothing. Elaborate statements regarding the Tribe's relationship with the BIA would have been unwarranted in the Settlement Act, given that the Tribe had not yet been recognized.</p>\n<p>Moreover, that subsequent acts dealing with Eastern tribes made specific provision for the Secretary's ability to take land in trust for a tribe, <i>see, e.g.,</i> 25 U.S.C. § 1771d(c) &amp; (d) (Massachusetts Indian Claims Settlement); <i>id.</i> § 1724(d) (Maine Indian Claims Settlement); <i>id.</i> § 1754(b) (Connecticut Indian Claims Settlement), supports the conclusion that Congress anticipated no such result under the Settlement Act. Given that the State had full criminal and civil jurisdiction over its territory, that any potential jurisdictional issue concerning the Settlement Lands was specifically addressed, and that all future Indian land claims were barred, there would be no future land scenarios that Congress would need to address more specifically (as it did in the other acts).<sup>[29]</sup> As we have noted, \"the Settlement Act, properly read, ensures that the State may demand the Tribe's compliance with state laws of general application.\" <i>Narragansett Tribe,</i> 449 F.3d at 26.</p>\n<p>There is also nothing novel about requiring the BIA to accept the Parcel into trust with restrictions. The BIA is authorized to take restricted interests in land into trust, <i>see</i> 25 U.S.C. § 465, and, in dealing with other tribes, Congress has specifically directed the BIA to take land into trust subject to a settlement act's provisions, <i>see, e.g., id.</i> § 1771d(d); <i>id.</i> § 1773b.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting that Congress acted promptly to preserve the State's jurisdiction over the Tribe's lands the last time this court challenged it. When this court held that the Tribe exercised sufficient <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> jurisdiction and governmental authority over the Settlement Lands to invoke the Indian Regulatory Gaming Act, <i>see Narragansett Tribe,</i> 19 F.3d at 703, Congress promptly amended the Settlement Act to provide explicitly that the Settlement Lands are not \"Indian lands\" for purposes of that Act, <i>see</i> 25 U.S.C. § 1708(b).</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I am in complete agreement with Judge Howard's cogent and articulate dissent, and I join it unreservedly. Nevertheless, I write separately to express my regret that, in taking far too narrow a view of the Settlement Act, the majority gives short shrift not only to the interests of the State of Rhode Island but also to the carefully calibrated arrangements crafted between the State and the Tribe.</p>\n<p>We previously have made clear that the touchstone in resolving jurisdictional disputes between the State and the Tribe is the full effectuation of the parties' intent. <i>See </i><i>Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Rhode Island,</i> 449 F.3d 16, 22, 25 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc). Yet, today, the majority sets aside the parties' intent in favor of a wooden reading of one subsection of the Settlement Act. <i>See ante</i> at 34 (\"By its terms, section 1708(a) applies state law only to the 1800 acres of `settlement lands.' The Parcel is not part of the settlement lands.\").</p>\n<p>Despite the artful draftmanship of the majority opinion, the provision on which it relies cannot be wrested from its historical context and read in a vacuum. The Settlement Act, when taken together with the extinguishment of all Indian claims referable to lands in Rhode Island, the Tribe's surrender of its right to an autonomous enclave, and the waiver of much of its sovereign immunity, <i>see </i><i>Narragansett Indian Tribe,</i> 449 F.3d at 22, 24-25, suggests with unmistakable clarity that the parties intended to fashion a broad arrangement that preserved the State's civil, criminal, and regulatory jurisdiction over any and all lands within its borders. Therefore, the Settlement Act logically and equitably should be read to prohibit <i>any</i> unilateral action that would upset this hard-bargained and delicate jurisdictional balance.</p>\n<p>The Secretary's taking of an after-acquired parcel into an unrestricted trust is just such an event. It strains credulity to surmise, as does the majority, that the State would have made such substantial concessionsincluding the transfer, free and clear, of 1800 acres of its landwhile leaving open the gaping loophole that today's decision creates.</p>\n<p>The majority admits that this case is \"in many ways a proxy for the State's larger concerns about its sovereignty,\" <i>ante</i> at 20, including the State's understandable worry that the Tribe will use this parcel (or future parcels that might be acquired and placed into trust) for activities that would be forbidden under State law and anathema to a majority of the State's citizens. At oral argument, the Secretary of the Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs appeared to disclaim any vestige of responsibility for the State's concerns. Despite this disclaimer and \"the genuineness of the State's sense that its bargain has been upset,\" <i>ante</i> at 38, the majority turns its back on the State.</p>\n<p>In my view, this is errorand error of the most deleterious kind. The majority, without anything approaching sufficient justification, is engaging in pointless literalism and forcing the State to rely on the faint velleity that the Secretary will use caution in the exercise of his responsibilities in connection with the Parcel. While <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> \"hope\" is the official motto of Rhode Island, the State should not be force-fed hope in place of rights for which it has bargained.</p>\n<p>As Indian tribes evolve in modern society, old legal rules tend to blur. The controversy that divides our court today is vexing and of paramount importance to both the State and the Tribe. Thus, the issueas well as the underlying principles of Indian lawdoubtless would benefit from consideration by the Supreme Court. That is a consummation devoutly to be wished. In the meantime, however, there is too much at stake to allow the Tribe, with the contrivance of the Secretary's taking the Parcel into trust, to walk away from an arrangement that it helped to fashion and from which it has benefitted over the years.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Defendant Gale A. Norton has been substituted with Dirk Kempthorne. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2).</p>\n<p>[1]  By contrast, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act provides the State with a limited role in determining whether land is taken into trust for gaming purposes. <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. § 2719(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>[2]  The State's challenges to the Secretary's authority under the IRA and the Constitution have national implications that reach beyond Rhode Island; accordingly, ten states and the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion have filed amicus briefs in support of Rhode Island. Similarly, numerous tribes and tribal organizations have filed amicus briefs in support of the Secretary. We acknowledge the able assistance provided by the amici curiae states and National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion on behalf of the State, and amici curiae National Congress of American Indians, individual Indian tribes and tribal organizations, and the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians on behalf of the Secretary.</p>\n<p>[3]  In \"an abundance of caution,\" we recognized that the Tribe may still possess some autonomy in local government matters such as membership rules, inheritance rules, and regulation of domestic relations. <i>Narragansett III,</i> 449 F.3d at 26.</p>\n<p>[4]  The Housing Authority was a duly recognized Indian housing authority and was given HUD funds to finance the purchase of the property and the construction of approximately 50 units of housing. <i>See</i> Indian Housing Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1437aa-1437ff (<i>repealed by</i> Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996, 25 U.S.C. §§ 4101-4243).\n</p>\n<p>The district court found the proposed housing project could be detrimental to coastal and groundwater resources, but also held that the Parcel was a \"dependent Indian community\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1151(b) and therefore partially denied injunctive relief. <i>Narragansett Elec. Co.,</i> 878 F.Supp. at 355-57, 366. On appeal, this court held that the land for the housing project was not a \"dependent Indian community\" because federal ownership of the land and federal action to \"set aside\" the land were lacking. <i>Narragansett II,</i> 89 F.3d at 921-22. Thus, the Parcel could not be considered Indian country under 18 U.S.C. § 1151(b), and the housing project being constructed on the site was not exempt from state and local building and zoning restrictions. Accordingly, this court reversed the district court and directed the district court to enter an order granting the injunction. 89 F.3d at 922.</p>\n<p>[5]  The IBIA rejected the State's insistence that the Secretary take account of the potential use of the Parcel for gaming purposes under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. § 2701, calling such a possibility merely speculative. 35 I.B.I.A. at 103. The IBIA also concluded that there had been no violation of the Coastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. § 1451. 35 I.B.I.A. at 103.</p>\n<p>[6]  At oral argument, the Secretary indicated that although a tribe has civil regulatory jurisdiction over lands taken into trust, a state may seek to enforce its lawsto the extent they are not preempted by federal lawon trust lands either by agreement with the tribe or by seeking a determination in federal court that the State's interests with respect to enforcing a particular regulation outweigh the interests of the tribe and the federal government in fostering tribal self-government. <i>See </i><i>Hicks,</i> 533 U.S. at 362, 121 S.Ct. 2304 (\"When . . . state interests outside the reservation are implicated, States [sometimes] may regulate the activities even of tribe members on tribal land.\"); <i>see also id.</i> at 364, 121 S.Ct. 2304 (holding that state officers may execute on tribal lands process related to off-reservation violations of state law); <i>Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville,</i> 447 U.S. 134, 151, 100 S.Ct. 2069, 65 L.Ed.2d 10 (1980) (explaining that the state could require Indian tribes to collect taxes on sales of cigarettes to non-Indians). That issue is beyond the scope of this opinion.</p>\n<p>[7]  We reject two additional arguments offered by the State. First, it is not significant that 25 U.S.C. § 478 required tribes to opt out of the IRA by a fixed date, rather than one that depended on the date of recognition. In general, it is difficult to see why any tribe would opt out of a statute designed to benefit it, and the legislative history suggests that the provision was a legacy from earlier drafts of the bill that imposed duties on tribes in return for the benefits. <i>See Hearing on S.2755 and S.3645, supra,</i> at 262. As eventually passed, the only potential purpose of the election was to protect the rights of those that preferred the allotment system, an issue not relevant to tribes recognized after 1934.\n</p>\n<p>Second, we hesitate to attach much weight to the fact that later Congresses have explicitly provided for the IRA to apply to newly recognized tribes. As the Supreme Court has recently cautioned again, the views of later Congresses carry little weight in determining the intent of the Congress that enacted the statute in question. <i>See </i><i>Massachusetts v. EPA,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 127 S.Ct. 1438, 1460 &amp; n. 27, 167 L.Ed.2d 248 (2007). For the same reason, we do not take later enactments such as the 1994 amendments to section 476 to establish that Congress intended to make no distinctions among tribes in 1934. The parties have not pointed us to contemporaneous legislation that sheds further light on the issue.</p>\n<p>[8]  One difficulty arises from the fact that there seems to be no comprehensive list of tribes that were recognized and under federal jurisdiction as of June 18, 1934.</p>\n<p>[9]  The Secretary's interpretation also is consistent with regulations interpreting and implementing other federal statutes establishing Indian programs and services. For example, the applicability of the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1901-1963, the applicability of minimum standards for basic education of Indian children in schools operated by the BIA, <i>id.</i> § 2001, and eligibility for Indian financial assistance and social services programs, <i>id.</i> § 13, all are defined in terms of current federal recognition. <i>See</i> 25 C.F.R. § 23.2; <i>id.</i> § 36.3; <i>id.</i> § 20.100.</p>\n<p>[10]  Indian amici also submitted opinions of the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior discussing various tribes' eligibility to organize under the IRA as evidence that the Secretary has consistently interpreted \"now\" in section 479 to mean \"today.\" The State's attempt to distinguish these opinions is unsuccessful. For example, in discussing the IRA eligibility of the St. Croix Indians of Wisconsin, the Solicitor makes no mention whatsoever of the tribe's status as of 1934. Solicitor's Opinion, Jan. 29, 1941, 1 <i>Op. Sol. on Indian Affairs</i> 1026 (1979). The State argues that it is clear from context that the tribe was not recognized as of 1934. Yet, although this is true, the Solicitor discusses the fact that the tribe has never had a separate tribal status, and that <i>until it does so,</i> only those Indians who meet the half-blood test are eligible to organize under the IRA. <i>Id.</i> at 1027. Moreover, contrary to the State's position, the Solicitor's opinion indicates that if the tribe takes certain steps, it may later become eligible to organize under the IRA as a recognized band. <i>Id.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Similarly, in discussing the Nahma and Beaver Island Indians' eligibility to organize under the IRA, the Solicitor discusses the tribe's historical status, but then continues to discuss its then-current situation. Solicitor's Opinion, May 31, 1937, 1 <i>Op. Sol. on Indian Affairs</i> 747, 747-48 (1979). If the Solicitor had been concerned only with the tribe's status as of 1934, there would have been no reason for him to have considered the \"recent . . . attitude of the Interior Department on the band status\" of the Nahma and Beaver Indians, nor for him to state that it was \"out of the question to establish any existing band status\" before concluding that the Indians were eligible for organization only under the IRA's half-blood provision. <i>Id.</i> at 748.</p>\n<p>[11]  Nor is this case controlled by our en banc decision in <i>Narragansett III.</i> That case concerned the State's jurisdiction over the settlement lands, <i>see</i> 449 F.3d at 20, and has no bearing on whether the Settlement Act abrogates the Secretary's trust authority outside of the settlement lands. Similarly, cases holding that section 1708(a) survived federal recognition and the conveyance of the settlement lands to federal trust are of no help to the State, since section 1708(a) refers only to the settlement lands. <i>See </i><i>Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Nat'l Indian Gaming Comm'n,</i> 158 F.3d 1335, 1341-42 (D.C.Cir.1998); <i>Narragansett I,</i> 19 F.3d at 694-95.</p>\n<p>[12]  The State adds nothing to its argument by also styling it as an issue of claim preclusion. Obviously, the earlier litigation that resulted in the Settlement Act could not have resolved the question raised in this case of whether the Settlement Act restricts the Secretary's trust authority under the IRA. By invoking \"principles of res judicata,\" the State means nothing more than that the Tribe should be held to the settlement to which it previously agreed. What precisely the Tribe agreed to in the settlement is, of course, the question we are addressing.</p>\n<p>[13]  Section 1705 applies to the Narragansett Tribe and any land in Charlestown, Rhode Island. Section 1712 applies to land elsewhere in Rhode Island transferred by other Indian tribes. The relevant provisions in each are materially the same for our purposes here.</p>\n<p>[14]  We attach little significance to the fact that the Mashantucket Settlement Act explicitly authorizes trust acquisition, while the Rhode Island Settlement Act does not. The former, unlike the latter, granted federal recognition to the tribe. <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. § 1758(a).</p>\n<p>[15]  We do not accept the State's comparison of the Rhode Island Settlement Act to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), 43 U.S.C. §§ 1601-1629h, and the resulting suggestion that trust acquisition would be as inappropriate in Rhode Island as it purportedly would be in Alaska. ANCSA eliminated previously existing Indian country in Alaska. <i>See Native Vill. of Venetie,</i> 522 U.S. at 532-34, 118 S.Ct. 948. Even if one might infer from that elimination an intent to preclude later trust acquisitions, no such intent can be inferred from the Rhode Island Settlement Act's failure to affirmatively establish Indian country for an as-yet unrecognized tribe.</p>\n<p>[16]  The State has not cited any legislative history that might lead us to interpret the text differently.</p>\n<p>[17]  There are also other examples of Congress's imposing explicit conditions on the taking of land into trust, for example, by limiting the number of acres of land and the number of acre feet of water rights. <i>See </i><i>Nevada v. United States,</i> 221 F.Supp.2d 1241, 1244 (D.Nev.2002) (discussing section 103(A) of the Fallon Paiute Shoshone Indian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 1990, Pub.L. No. 101-618, 104 Stat. 3289, 3291).</p>\n<p>[18]  The Secretary takes the position that he has no authority to impose restrictions on land taken into trust under the IRA, absent a statutory directive imposing such restrictions. We do not reach this issue. To the extent that the State argues that the Settlement Act itself is such a statutory directive requiring a restricted trust, we reject that argument for the same reasons that we found that the Settlement Act does not eliminate trust authority altogether.</p>\n<p>[19]  In so holding, the Eighth Circuit agreed with the Tenth Circuit's decision in <i>United States v. Roberts,</i> 185 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 1999), which held that section 465 contains standards sufficient to guide the Secretary's exercise of discretion. <i>Id.</i> at 1137.</p>\n<p>[20]  Amici states argue that legislative history should not factor into the intelligible principle analysis. We note simply that the Supreme Court in <i>Mistretta</i> referred to legislative history in explaining that the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. <i>See</i> 488 U.S. at 375 n. 9, 376 n. 10, 109 S.Ct. 647.</p>\n<p>[21]  For the purpose of 25 C.F.R. part 151, land is considered to be on-reservation if it is \"located within or contiguous to an Indian reservation,\" 25 C.F.R. § 151.10, and off-reservation where \"the land is located outside of and noncontiguous to the tribe's reservation,\" <i>id.</i> § 151.11. The State challenges the finding by the BIA and the district court that the Parcel is adjacent to the settlement lands, yet recognizes that this determination is insignificant to the application of either section in this case, as the sections differ only slightly. <i>Compare id.</i> § 151.10, <i>with id.</i> § 151.11. The Parcel is adjacent to the Settlement Lands, but separated from them by a town road. <i>Narragansett II,</i> 89 F.3d at 911.</p>\n<p>[22]  Those factors include:\n</p>\n<p>(a) The existence of statutory authority for the acquisition and any limitations contained in such authority;</p>\n<p>(b) The need of the individual Indian or the tribe for additional land;</p>\n<p>(c) The purposes for which the land will be used;</p>\n<p>. . .</p>\n<p>(e) If the land to be acquired is in unrestricted fee status, the impact on the State and its political subdivisions resulting from the removal of the land from the tax rolls;</p>\n<p>(f) Jurisdictional problems and potential conflicts of land use which may arise; and</p>\n<p>(g) If the land to be acquired is in fee status, whether the Bureau of Indian Affairs is equipped to discharge the additional responsibilities resulting from the acquisition of the land in trust status.</p>\n<p>. . . .</p>\n<p>25 C.F.R. § 151.10.</p>\n<p>[23]  The criteria to be considered pursuant to section 151.11(b) are as follows:\n</p>\n<p>The location of the land relative to state boundaries, and its distance from the boundaries of the tribe's reservation, shall be considered as follows: as the distance between the tribe's reservation and the land to be acquired increases, the Secretary shall give greater scrutiny to the tribe's justification of anticipated benefits from the acquisition. . . .</p>\n<p>25 C.F.R. § 151.11(b).</p>\n<p>[24]  Specifically, 16 U.S.C. § 1456(c) provides, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>(1)(A) Each Federal agency activity within or outside the coastal zone that affects any land or water use or natural resource of the coastal zone shall be carried out in a manner which is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the enforceable policies of approved State management programs. A Federal agency activity shall be subject to this paragraph unless it is subject to paragraph (2) or (3).</p>\n<p>. . . .</p>\n<p>(C) Each Federal agency carrying out an activity subject to paragraph (1) shall provide a consistency determination to the relevant State agency. . . .</p>\n<p>(2) Any Federal agency which shall undertake any development project in the coastal zone of a state shall insure that the project is, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with the enforceable policies of approved State management programs.</p>\n<p>[25]  I do not challenge the majority's conclusion that the BIA may take the Parcel into trust, as the State previously permitted the Narragansetts to take the Settlement Lands into trust in 1988. But any new trust lands must also be explicitly made subject to the State's criminal and civil laws.</p>\n<p>[26]  Indeed, the very breadth of the language indicates more was contemplated by the parties than merely resolving an immediate dispute over title.</p>\n<p>[27]  The Tribe would still have the option of obtaining the State's consent to make certain Indian land claimssuch as the 1988 placement of the settlement lands in trust (subject to Rhode Island law) with the BIA.</p>\n<p>[28]  The Tribe's recognition by the BIA changed little, as this court has held that the jurisdictional grant to the State in the Settlement Act survived such recognition. <i>See </i><i>Narragansett Indian Tribe,</i> 19 F.3d at 694-95.</p>\n<p>[29]  In extinguishing the Tribe's aboriginal title in the Settlement Act, Congress was inspired by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (\"ANCSA\"). <i>See</i> H.R. Rep. 95-1453, at 1951. As noted by the Supreme Court, the ANCSA sought to accomplish this goal \"without creating a reservation system or lengthy wardship or trusteeship.\" <i>Alaska v. Native Village of Venetie Tribal Govt.,</i> 522 U.S. 520, 524, 118 S.Ct. 948, 140 L.Ed.2d 30 (1998) (internal citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n\n</div>",

The case is in many ways a proxy for the State's larger concerns about its sovereignty vis-à-vis federal and tribal control over lands within the state.</p>\n<p>In 1998, the Secretary of the Interior agreed to take into unreserved trust for the Tribe's benefit a 31- or 32-acre parcel in Charlestown, Rhode Island (the Parcel). Then-Secretary Gale Norton cited her powers under section 5 of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (IRA), 25 U.S.C. § 465. The Tribe had purchased the Parcel in 1991.</p>\n<p>Under the Indian Commerce Clause of the Constitution, U.S. Const. art.

Under section 5 of the IRA, Congress has authorized the Secretary \"in his discretion\" to acquire and take into trust for Indian tribes \"any interest in lands . . . within or without existing reservations . . . for the purpose of providing land for Indians.\" 25 U.S.C. § 465. The Secretary may take land into trust for these purposes, as was done here, without the consent of the State.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The Secretary's acquisition of land into trust for Indians results in the land becoming \"Indian country.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1151.

This provision is subject to the Secretary's power in specific cases or areas to make applicable those local laws determined to be in the best interest of the Indian owners \"in achieving the highest and best use of [the] property.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1.4(b).</p>\n<p>Concerned over the loss of sovereignty over the Parcel and what it may portend for the future, the State, its Governor, and the town of Charlestown (collectively, the State), sued the Secretary of the Interior, now Dirk Kempthorne, and the Regional Director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Franklin Keel, in federal court. <i>See </i><i>Carcieri v. Norton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2326332\"><a href=\"/opinion/2326332/carcieri-v-norton/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span> (D.R.I.2003). Having exhausted administrative remedies, the State brought suit under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 702, seeking review of the Secretary's decision to take the Parcel into trust. <i>Id.</i> at 169, 172.</p>\n<p>The State's case asserts three major theories. First, the State argues that the IRA does not authorize the Secretary to take land into trust for any tribe, including the Narragansetts, that first received federal recognition after June 18, 1934, the effective date of the IRA. Second, the State argues that the 1978 Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act (the Settlement Act), 25 U.S.C. §§ 1701-1716, restricts the Secretary's authority to place the Parcel into trust pursuant to the IRA. Third, the State argues that the Constitution prohibits this exercise of authority by the Secretary.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>As to the IRA, the State argues that the Narragansetts do not meet the definition of \"Indian\" contained in 25 U.S.C. § 479. The pertinent definition recognizes, inter alia, \"all persons of Indian descent who are members of any recognized Indian tribe <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> <i>now</i> under Federal jurisdiction.\" 25 U.S.C. § 479 (emphasis added). The State reads \"are members . . . now under Federal jurisdiction\" to plainly and literally mean the 1934 effective date of the IRA. The State thus contends that the Secretary has no authority under the IRA to take land into trust for any tribe that was not federally recognized in 1934. As a result, the State argues, the Secretary is precluded entirely from placing the Parcel into trust for the Narragansetts, who were not recognized as a tribe until 1983.</p>\n<p>Next, the State argues that the terms of the Settlement Act preclude the Secretary from placing the Parcel into trust because the Settlement Act is a later specific act of Congress that must be read to have explicitly and implicitly cabined the Tribe's and the Secretary's power as to the Parcel. The State argues that the Settlement Act bars the imposition of any trust. The State's fallback position is that any trust must be restricted by the terms of the Settlement Act so that it is clear that state and local law apply to the Parcel, just as they do to the settlement lands.</p>\n<p>Finally, the State asserts various constitutional theories, with the common underpinning that the placing of the Parcel into trust violates the State's sovereignty. The State argues that the Indian Commerce Clause does not authorize the Secretary's exercise of power and that the exercise violates the Tenth Amendment, as well as the Enclave and Admissions Clauses of the Constitution. The State also argues that section 5 of the IRA, 25 U.S.C. § 465, constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</p>\n<p>We hold that the language of 25 U.S.C. § 479 does not plainly refer to the 1934 enactment date of the IRA. We find that the text is sufficiently ambiguous in its use of the term \"now\" that the Secretary has, under the <i>Chevron</i> doctrine, authority to construe the Act. We reject the State's claim that we do not owe deference to the Secretary's interpretation because he has inconsistently interpreted or applied section 479. The State's evidence of inconsistency is mixed and is not persuasive. The Secretary's position has not been inconsistent, much less arbitrary. The Secretary's interpretation is rational and not inconsistent with the statutory language or legislative history, and must be honored.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the Settlement Act neither explicitly bars by its terms the Secretary's actions, nor implicitly repeals or constrains the Secretary's authority under the IRA to place land into trust for the Tribe. While the State apparently failed to anticipate this particular problem at the time of the settlement, the Settlement Act did specifically contemplate the event of federal recognition of the Tribe and did not restrict the Secretary's power, should the Tribe be recognized, to take into trust land outside of the settlement lands. We are not free to reform the Act. If aggrieved, the State must turn to Congress.</p>\n<p>The State's arguments based on allocations of power under the U.S. Constitution also do not prevail. They do, however, underscore the seriousness of the State's concern about the abrogation of state sovereignty at stake here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>In order to understand the nature of the controversy and the consequences of this decision, a brief recounting of the history of relations between the State and the Tribe is required. Further background can be found in the district court's opinion, <i>Carcieri,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2326332\"><a href=\"/opinion/2326332/carcieri-v-norton/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, as well as the opinions previously issued in the decades-long disputes between the State and the Tribe, <i>see </i><i>Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Rhode Island (Narragansett III),</i> 449 F.3d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> 16 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc); <i>Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Narragansett Elec. Co. (Narragansett II),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196879\"><a href=\"/opinion/196879/narragansett-indians-v-state-of-ri/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1996); <i>Rhode Island v. Narragansett Indian Tribe (Narragansett I),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195256\"><a href=\"/opinion/195256/state-of-ri-v-narragansett-tribe/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>In 1880, the State acquired the majority of the Tribe's lands. In 1934, the Tribe organized as a state-chartered corporation. In 1975, the Tribe sued to recover its lands, arguing that the State had acquired the lands in violation of the Indian Nonintercourse Act, 25 U.S.C. § 177. The Tribe claimed that this violation rendered void the transfer of title to the lands.</p>\n<p>This cloud on title prompted the State to enter into settlement negotiations with the Tribe, which led in 1978 to an agreement embodied in a Joint Memorandum of Understanding (JMOU). Under the JMOU, the Tribe would receive 1800 acres of \"settlement lands,\" half of which were provided by the State and half of which were purchased with federal funds. The State agreed to create an Indian-controlled corporation to hold the settlement lands in trust for the Tribe, to exempt the settlement lands from local taxation, and to help secure the federal legislation necessary to implement the agreement. In exchange, the Tribe abandoned its claims of aboriginal title and its claims to lands in the state other than the settlement lands.</p>\n<p>In turn, Congress approved and codified the agreement in the Settlement Act. The Settlement Act provided that \"the settlement lands shall be subject to the civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of the State of Rhode Island.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1708(a).</p>\n<p>Five years later, in 1983, the Secretary granted the Tribe official federal recognition. <i>See</i> Final Determination for Federal Acknowledgment of Narragansett Indian Tribe of Rhode Island, 48 Fed.Reg. 6177 (Feb. 10, 1983). Following that recognition, in 1985, Rhode Island amended the pertinent state statute to permit the conveyance of the settlement lands directly to the Tribe, explicitly preserving the State's jurisdiction over the settlement lands, consistent with the Settlement Act, 25 U.S.C. § 1708(a). <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws § 37-18-13(b). The holding company conveyed the settlement lands to the Tribe, and three years later, the Tribe conveyed the settlement lands to the BIA as trustee. The trust deed confirmed the application of state law to the settlement lands, as provided in 25 U.S.C. § 1708(a). The BIA continues to hold the settlement lands in trust for the Tribe, subject to this congressionally-enacted restriction that state law applies. <i>See </i><i>Narragansett I,</i> 19 F.3d at 689, 695 n. 8. Significantly, in our earlier en banc decision in <i>Narragansett III,</i> we held that the language of section 1708(a) trumped any residual tribal sovereignty over the settlement lands, under which the Tribe had refused to comply with certain state laws.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See</i> 449 F.3d at 26.</p>\n<p>Then, in 1991, the tribal housing authority purchased the Parcel in fee simple, acquiring title through purchase from a private developer. The Parcel was part of the Tribe's aboriginal lands claimed in the 1976 lawsuit. Under the Settlement Act, the Tribe had thus relinquished aboriginal title to the Parcel, but the Parcel is not part of the 1800 acres of settlement lands. It is adjacent to the settlement lands, across a town road. In 1992, the Housing Authority transferred the Parcel to the Tribe with a deed restriction that the Parcel be placed in trust with the BIA for the purpose of providing housing.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> A dispute soon arose over whether development of the Parcel had to comply with local law. The Tribe began construction on the planned housing project without obtaining a building permit from the Town or the State's approval of the individual sewage disposal systems. The Tribe essentially took the position that once it had purchased the Parcel, the land had become tribal land, and the Tribe's inherent sovereignty meant that the Parcel was exempt from local law. The State disagreed and filed suit in federal court to enjoin the Tribe. <i>See </i><i>Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Narragansett Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1440189\"><a href=\"/opinion/1440189/narragansett-ind-tribe-of-ri-v-narragansett-elec/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span> (D.R.I.1995). Ultimately, the Tribe lost that litigation.<sup>[4]</sup><i>See </i><i>Narragansett II,</i> 89 F.3d at 922.</p>\n<p>The Tribe had sought to solve the issue of the applicability of state law to the Parcel by applying to the Secretary in 1993 to have the Parcel taken into trust under section 5 of the IRA. The Secretary's determination of whether to do so was stayed pending the resolution of the federal court litigation. After the litigation was resolved against the Tribe by this court in 1996, <i>id.</i> at 922, the Tribe submitted a second application to the Secretary.</p>\n<p>The Tribe filed this updated application with the Secretary in July 1997. In determining whether to take lands into trust, the Secretary follows a regulatory process set forth at 25 C.F.R. part 151, which requires consideration of several factors. If, as here, the land is off reservation, additional criteria apply. <i>See</i> 25 C.F.R. § 151.11. Generally, the farther from a reservation the land is, the greater the scrutiny the Secretary gives to the justification of anticipated benefits from the acquisition. <i>See id.</i> § 151.11(e); <i>see also</i> M.J. Sheppard, <i>Taking Indian Land into Trust,</i> 44 S.D. L.Rev. 681, 686 (1999).</p>\n<p>On March 6, 1998, the BIA notified the State of the Secretary's intent to take the Parcel into trust for the Tribe. The State appealed the decision to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals (IBIA). The State argued, inter alia, that the Settlement Act prohibited this action by the Secretary, and that in taking the land into trust without the State's consent, the Secretary had acted unconstitutionally. The IBIA affirmed the BIA's determination on June 29, 2000. <i>Town of Charlestown v. E. Area Dir., Bureau of Indian Affairs,</i> 35 I.B.I.A. 93, 106 (2000). It noted it had no jurisdiction over the claims of unconstitutionality.<sup>[5]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 97.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> The State then instituted this action in federal court. The district court, in a comprehensive decision, rejected the State's claims. <i>See </i><i>Carcieri,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2326332\"><a href=\"/opinion/2326332/carcieri-v-norton/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>. A divided panel of this court affirmed. <i>Carcieri v. Norton,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></span> (1st Cir. 2005). The en banc court granted rehearing and withdrew the panel opinion.</p>\n<p>As described above and recounted in our en banc decision in <i>Narragansett III,</i> 449 F.3d at 18-21, for several decades the relationship between the Tribe and the State has been fraught with tension.</p>\n<p>The State's short-term concerns in this case have to do with whether the particular project will conform with state and local law. The State also has concerns that once land is taken into trust, there will be very few mechanisms, other than negotiation with the Tribe or appeal to the Secretary's authority under 25 C.F.R. § 1.4(b), by which the State may secure compliance with state and local laws.<sup>[6]</sup> The State fears that the Tribe will convert or otherwise use the Parcel, or any future parcels that might be acquired and put into trust, for income-producing activities in which it normally would not be permitted to engage under state law.</p>\n<p>There has been federal litigation between state officials and the Tribe and its members over such activities. In 2003, the Tribe, seeking revenue, established on the settlement lands an Indian Smoke Shop that sold cigarettes without purchasing state cigarette stamps or collecting sales taxes then paid to the State, as required by state law. The State Police raided the smoke shop and initiated criminal prosecutions against tribe members. The Tribe sought a declaratory judgment in federal court asserting that its control over the smoke shop was an inherent function of tribal sovereignty that survived the Settlement Act, despite the explicit language in section 1708(a). We rejected that claim en banc. <i>Narragansett III,</i> 449 F.3d at 30-31.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n<p>Technically, the claims at issue here are reviewed through the lens of an APA appeal under 5 U.S.C. § 706. Our review of such an appeal is de novo as to the district court's conclusions. <i>See </i><i>Harvey v. Veneman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201417\"><a href=\"/opinion/201417/harvey-v-veneman/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir. 2005). The underlying issues remaining in the case are statutory and constitutional. Statutory issues are reviewed de novo by the courts, but subject to established principles of deference to the administering agency. <i>Id.</i> Constitutional claims are reviewed de novo. <i>See </i><i>Cousins v. Sec'y of Transp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526737\"><a href=\"/opinion/526737/michael-cousins-v-secretary-of-the-united-states-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, 610 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> B. <i>The 1934 Indian Reorganization Act</i></p>\n<p>The State argues that the Secretary lacks authority to place the Parcel into trust under 25 U.S.C. § 465 since, under the definition of \"Indian\" in 25 U.S.C. § 479, that authority extends only to tribes that were both federally \"recognized\" and \"under [f]ederal jurisdiction\" on June 18, 1934, the effective date of the IRA.</p>\n<p>The State presents a series of cascading arguments. First, the State argues that the plain language of section 479 is clear, and that under that plain language, the Tribe's status is measured as of 1934. The State further argues that its interpretation of the statute is the only one consistent with the purposes and legislative history of the Act. Thus, the State argues that because the statute is unambiguous, deference to the Secretary is unwarranted. In any event, the State argues that even if deference might have been warranted, the Secretary's current interpretation is not entitled to deference because it contradicts the Secretary's practice in the more than seventy years since the passage of the IRA.</p>\n<p>1. Chevron <i>Analysis</i></p>\n<p>The Secretary has offered an interpretation of the IRA that permits trust acquisitions for tribes recognized and under federal jurisdiction at the time the request for a trust acquisition is made. A court reviewing an agency's interpretation of a statute that it administers engages in a two-step analysis. <i>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def.

Lee Holding Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202558\"><a href=\"/opinion/202558/rucker-v-lee-holding-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.2006). The language at issue is that contained in 25 U.S.C. § 479, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote>The term \"Indian\" as used in this Act shall include all persons of Indian descent who are members of any recognized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction, and all persons who are descendants of such members who were, on June 1, 1934, residing within the present boundaries of any Indian reservation, and shall further include all other persons of one-half or more Indian blood.</blockquote>\n<p>One might have an initial instinct to read the word \"now\" in the statute as the State does, to mean the date of enactment of the statute, June 18, 1934. Congress certainly has used the word \"now\" in this way. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Montana v. Kennedy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106242\"><a href=\"/opinion/106242/montana-v-kennedy/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 312, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106242\"><a href=\"/opinion/106242/montana-v-kennedy/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This is not a case that can be resolved by looking to the plain meaning of the term \"now\" standing by itself. \"Now\" means \"at the present time,\" but there is ambiguity as to whether to view the term \"now\" as operating at the moment Congress enacted it or at the moment the Secretary invokes it. Indeed, Congress sometimes uses the word \"now\" to refer to a time other than the moment of enactment. <i>See</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> <i>Difford v.

On the one hand, the State points to 25 U.S.C. § 472, another provision of the IRA, which refers to \"positions maintained, now or hereafter, by the Indian Office.\" The State argues that this use of \"now\" unambiguously refers to the date of enactment and that had Congress wanted to include later-recognized tribes in section 479, it would have similarly added the words \"or hereafter.\"</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Secretary points out that section 479 itself specifies the date of \"June 1, 1934\" as the relevant date for determining eligibility based on \"residing within the present boundaries of any Indian reservation.\" The Secretary thus counters that had Congress wanted to require recognition of a tribe on the date of enactment, it would have specified that date, rather than using the term \"now.\" <i>See also</i> 25 U.S.C. § 478 (requiring elections to be held \"within one year after June 18, 1934\"). Hence, \"now\" might mean \"now or hereafter\" or it might mean \"June 18, 1934\"; either would be consistent with some other part of the statute.</p>\n<p>Policy does not provide an obvious answer either: each side has a plausible explanation that policy considerations favor its interpretation. The State argues that the principal, perhaps exclusive, concern of the 1934 statute was with remedying the perceived ills of the prior practice of allotment. <i>See </i><i>Kahawaiolaa v. Norton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2305444\"><a href=\"/opinion/2305444/kahawaiolaa-v-norton/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1213</span></a></span>, 1220 n. 10 (D.Haw.2002). Because the IRA ended allotments in 1934, <i>see</i> 25 U.S.C. § 461, they would not have affected later-recognized tribes, and hence there would have been no reason to include such tribes within the ambit of the statute.</p>\n<p>The Secretary takes the view that the Act was intended not only to remedy past wrongs, but also to set a template for the future that would encourage the strength and stability of tribal communities. Based on this view, it would make no sense to distinguish among tribes based on the happenstance of their federal recognition status in 1934. The Secretary's view is buttressed by the fact that the Act contains a number of provisions that have nothing to do with land consolidation. <i>See id.</i> § 472 (Indian employment preference); <i>id.</i> § 476 (tribal organization).</p>\n<p>The State reads <i>United States v.

It is unclear if the Court had any such interpretation, and in any event, we find that <i>John</i> is not controlling here. In <i>John,</i> the Fifth Circuit had found that the Mississippi Choctaws were not eligible for benefits under the IRA because the tribe had not been recognized in 1934. <i>United States v.

The Supreme Court reversed, relying on a different clause in the statute and finding the tribe eligible for benefits under the IRA, but on the basis that its members <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> were \"persons of one-half or more Indian blood.\" 437 U.S. at 650, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109917\"><a href=\"/opinion/109917/united-states-v-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The bracketed addition may be read to support the State's position, but the opinion contains no analysis on this point, and the Court rested its holding on an entirely separate provision of the Act, one not at issue here. We are mindful that the Supreme Court's musings may warrant our attention. <i>See </i><i>Rossiter v. Potter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200832\"><a href=\"/opinion/200832/rossiter-v-potter/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 31 n. 3 (1st Cir. 2004); <i>but see</i> P. Leval, <i>Judging Under the Constitution: Dicta About Dicta,</i> 81 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 1249 (2006). In this case, however, given <i>John's</i> complete lack of analysis of the provision that concerns us, the relevant language seems to us to fall short even of being dicta.</p>\n<p>Having found both text and context to be ambiguous, we turn to legislative history. Despite the State's arguments to the contrary, that history also does not clearly resolve the issue. Indeed, it suggests a reading of the phrase \"now under federal jurisdiction\" different from that offered by any of the parties, and is thus another source of ambiguity.</p>\n<p>The congressional record establishes that the phrase \"now under federal jurisdiction\" was specifically added to the statutory definition of \"Indian,\" a term defined separately from \"tribe.\" <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. § 479. The phrase was suggested by then-Commissioner of Indian Affairs John Collier in response to the concern that not all self-identified Indians deserved to benefit from the Act:</p>\n<blockquote>The Chairman. But the thing about it is this, Senator; I think you have to sooner or later eliminate those Indians who are at the present timeas I said the other day, you have a tribe of Indians here, for instance in northern California, several so-called \"tribes\" there. They are no more Indians than you or I, perhaps. I mean they are white people essentially. And yet they are under the supervision of the Government of the United States, and there is no reason for it at all, in my judgment. Their lands ought to be turned over to them in severalty and divided up and let them go ahead and operate their own property in their own way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Senator O'Mahoney. If I may suggest, that could be handled by some separate provision excluding from the benefits of the act certain types, but must have a general definition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Commissioner Collier. Would this not meet your thought, Senator: After the words \"recognized Indian tribe\" in line 1 insert \"now under Federal jurisdiction\"? That would limit the act to the Indians now under Federal jurisdiction, except that other Indians of more than one-half Indian blood would get help.</blockquote>\n<p><i>To Grant to Indians Living Under Federal Tutelage the Freedom To Organize for Purposes of Local Self-Government and Economic Enterprise: Hearing on S.2755 and S.3645 Before the S. Comm. on Indian Affairs,</i> 73d Cong. 266 (1934).</p>\n<p>Commissioner Collier offered the phrase as a limitation, but it is not clear whether it was intended as a temporal limitation. If the committee was concerned about the bona fides of an individual's status as an Indian and wanted to use the fact of federal jurisdiction to measure those bona fides, then there would have been no reason to distinguish between those under federal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> jurisdiction in 1934 and those who later came under federal jurisdiction. In fact, the colloquy quoted above suggests that the committee sought to exclude some Indians already \"under the supervision of the Government of the United States.\" If the purpose was to exclude those who might later be dropped from federal jurisdiction, it would make more sense to measure status as of the date benefits were sought, not as of the date of enactment of the statute.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the colloquy and the remainder of the hearing suggest that the committee was focused on the issue of <i>individual</i> Indians who received benefits from the federal government on the basis of a limited heritage and without acting as a part of a tribal community. Earlier in the session, the chairman had raised the case of a \"former Vice President of the United States,\" who was apparently receiving Indian benefits, asking, \"Why should the Government of the United States be managing the property of a lot of Indians who are practically white and hold office and do everything else, but in order to evade taxes or in order to do something else they come in under the Government supervision and control?\" <i>Id.</i> at 264.</p>\n<p>Thus, although none of the parties have raised this, it may well be that the phrase \"now under federal jurisdiction\" was intended to modify not \"recognized Indian tribe,\" but rather \"all persons of Indian descent.\" So interpreted, the purpose of the phrase might well have been to grandfather in those <i>individuals</i> already receiving federal benefits, but to otherwise insist that in the future, only individuals with at least one-half Indian blood would qualify. In that case, the limitation may well have been a temporal one, but the limitation, temporal or not, may have been intended to affect only the Secretary's authority to act for the benefit of an \"individual Indian,\" not an \"Indian tribe.\" <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. § 465 (\"Title to any lands or rights acquired pursuant to this Act . . . shall be taken in the name of the United States in trust for the <i>Indian tribe or individual Indian</i> for which the land is acquired. . . .\" (emphasis added)). After all, while Congress may have been concerned about misdirecting resources to individuals who were only Indians in name, the same concern would not apply to federally recognized tribes, regardless of the date of federal recognition. In any event, this piece of legislative history amply supports the view that the statute is at least ambiguous and leaves room for administrative interpretation.</p>\n<p>The other relevant piece of legislative history, heavily relied upon by the State, is the statement of Representative Edgar Howard, a cosponsor of the IRA:</p>\n<blockquote>For purposes of this act, [the definitional section] defines the persons who shall be classed as Indian. In essence, it recognizes the status quo of the present reservation Indians and further includes all other persons of one-fourth Indian blood. The latter provision is intended to prevent persons of less than one-fourth Indian blood who are already enrolled members of a tribe or descendants of such members living on a reservation from claiming financial and other benefits of the act. Obviously the line must be drawn somewhere . . .</blockquote>\n<p><i>Kahawaiolaa,</i> 222 F.Supp.2d at 1220 n. 10 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Congressional Debate on Wheeler-Howard Bill (1934) <i>in</i> III <i>The American Indian and the United States</i> (1973)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The State interprets the reference to \"status quo\" as supporting its view that federal recognition of tribes was essentially frozen for purposes of the IRA in 1934. This seems to be a misinterpretation of the quote, however. Representative Howard did not say that the Act would \"maintain\" or \"preserve\" the status quo; rather he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> stated that the Act would \"recognize\" it. Moreover, the quote refers not to Indian tribes, but to \"reservation Indians.\" Thus, in context, this sentence is more likely a reference to that portion of the definition of an Indian, not at issue here, that covers \"all persons who are descendants of such members who were, on June 1, 1934, residing within the present boundaries of any Indian reservation.\" 25 U.S.C. § 479. This provision, with its explicit reference to 1934, covered those people of Indian descent then living on a reservation, without regard to whether they might independently qualify as Indians under the Act. In that sense, the definition accepted and \"recognized\" the status quo of the reservations.</p>\n<p>Thus, we find from the text, context, and legislative history that section 479 is at least ambiguous as to whether the phrase \"now under federal jurisdiction\" disqualifies tribes that were federally recognized after 1934, such as the Narragansett Tribe, from the benefits of the IRA.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>(b) <i>Whether the Secretary's Interpretation Is Permissible</i></p>\n<p>As we have found the meaning of section 479 to be ambiguous, we must consider whether the Secretary's interpretation is \"permissible.\" <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S. at 843, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2778</span></a></span>. An interpretation is permissible if it is \"rational and consistent with the statute.\" <i>NLRB v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, Local 23,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111970\"><a href=\"/opinion/111970/nlrb-v-food-commercial-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>, 123, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111970\"><a href=\"/opinion/111970/nlrb-v-food-commercial-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span> (1987). The Secretary's construction meets this test. As discussed above, it is reasonable and is consistent with the language and legislative history of the IRA. It also is consistent with the policy of the IRA, which, as we have indicated, may permissibly be viewed not only as intending to reverse the government's allotment policy, but also as affirmatively conferring benefits on Indians, including Indian employment preferences and a statutory right to organize and adopt governing documents.</p>\n<p>We therefore reject the State's argument that the text and purposes of the IRA prohibit the Secretary's interpretation of section 479. Rather, we find that the Secretary's construction of section 479 as allowing trust acquisitions for tribes that are recognized and under federal jurisdiction at the time of the trust application is entitled to deference.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Alleged Inconsistency of the Secretary's Interpretation</i></p>\n<p>The State makes a separate argument on which it heavily relies. It argues that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> the Secretary's interpretation of section 479 to allow trust acquisitions for tribes not federally recognized in 1934 represents a change in position as to the eligibility of tribes for IRA benefits, and that this interpretation therefore is not entitled to deference. The State relies particularly on historical practice, and says that the Secretary has never, or at least has hardly ever, identified as IRA-eligible a tribal entity that was not federally recognized in 1934 and does not meet the half-blood test. The evidence is limited with respect to whether the Secretary's interpretation of section 479 of the IRA has been consistent over the past seventy-three years.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>The consistency of the Secretary's construction is supported, though not directly, by a regulation promulgated by the Secretary in 1980. The regulation, found at 25 C.F.R. § 151.2, sets forth definitions that pertain to the regulations governing trust acquisitions. 25 C.F.R. § 151.2(b) defines a tribe that may be eligible for a trust acquisition as \"any Indian tribe, band, nation, pueblo, community, rancheria, colony, or other group of Indians . . . which is recognized by the Secretary as eligible for the special programs and services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\" The regulation does not distinguish between tribes recognized before June 18, 1934 and those recognized thereafter. Rather, it suggests that whether or not a group of Indians is considered a tribe, and therefore may be eligible to have land taken into trust, turns on a tribe's federal recognition status at the time a trust acquisition is requested.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Secretary's proffered interpretation of \"now\" as meaning \"today\" is consistent with regulations implementing other provisions of the IRA.<sup>[9]</sup> For example, the regulation implementing 25 U.S.C. § 466, which directs the Secretary to regulate the operation and management of Indian forestry units, states that it applies to \"any Indian tribe . . . which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.\" 25 C.F.R. § 163.1. Similarly, the regulation implementing 25 U.S.C. § 476, which allows eligible Indian tribes to organize and adopt constitutions and bylaws, defines eligibility in current terms: all Indian entities that have not voted to exclude themselves from the IRA and that are \"included, or [are] eligible to be included, among those tribes . . . recognized and receiving services from the [BIA]\" are eligible to organize under section 476. 25 C.F.R. § 81.1.</p>\n<p>As to the Secretary's trust acquisition practice, it is not seriously disputed that the Secretary has never <i>rejected</i> an application to take land into trust for a federally recognized tribe on the ground that the tribe was not recognized and under federal jurisdiction in 1934. Responding to the State's allegations about whose trust acquisition applications have been <i>granted,</i> the Secretary and Indian amici have submitted to us lists of tribes that they assert were not federally recognized in 1934 for whom land has since been taken into trust. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> The State disputes this evidence, arguing that nearly all of the identified tribes either have no trust lands, are not \"newly recognized\" because they were under federal jurisdiction in 1934, or have obtained legislation from Congress specifically permitting trust acquisitions on their behalf.</p>\n<p>The State's evidence of inconsistent practice is not persuasive. For example, although the State seems to concede that the Miccosukee Tribe was not recognized in 1934, it argues that the later trust acquisition for that tribe identified by Indian amici was made pursuant to specific statutory authorization, not section 465. But the statute to which the State points us, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1741-1750e, does not itself authorize acquisition of the parcel identified by Indian amici. Rather, it authorizes acquisition of a different parcel. Indeed, in taking the parcel identified by Indian amici into trust, the Secretary explicitly relied on his authority under section 465.</p>\n<p>Turning to a different distinction, the State argues that eight of the tribes identified by Indian amici were recognized and under federal jurisdiction in 1934 because they previously had signed treaties with the United States. It is not self-evident that simply because a tribe had signed a treaty with the U.S. government it necessarily was recognized and under federal jurisdiction in 1934; recognition as intended in section 479 requires an ongoing government-to-government relationship between a tribe and the United States. <i>See Cohen's Handbook of Federal Indian Law</i> § 3.02(3), at 138-40 (N.J. Newton et al., eds. 2005).</p>\n<p>Whether or not a treaty executed before 1934 has significance, however, the evidence is still that the Secretary has taken land into trust for tribes that did not <i>appear</i> to be federally recognized in 1934. We note two examples. The Secretary has taken land into trust for the Sault Ste. Marie Band of Chippewa Indians despite the Secretary's position that, regardless of prior treaties, the Band was not federally recognized in 1934. The Sault Ste. Marie Band is a successor to some of the Chippewa tribes that had signed treaties with the United States between 1785 and 1855. In addition, in 1855 the Band had signed two treaties with the United States. Despite those treaties, however, by 1917 the Department of the Interior did not recognize the Band as an entity with which it had government-to-government relations. Opinion of Nat'l Indian Gaming Comm'n, The St. Ignace Parcel at 7 (July 31, 2006); <i>see also </i><i>City of Sault Ste. Marie v. Andrus,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2145709\"><a href=\"/opinion/2145709/city-of-sault-ste-marie-mich-v-andrus/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 161 (D.D.C.1980) (indicating that a period of non-recognition existed by stating that \"although the question of whether some groups qualified as Indian tribes for purposes of IRA benefits might have been unclear in 1934, that fact does not preclude the Secretary from subsequently determining that a given tribe deserved recognition in 1934\"). The State rejoins that the Department of the Interior cannot abrogate an Indian treaty. But the validity of the Department's treatment of the Sault Ste. Marie Band's status under the treaties is not the issue before us. What is important is the Department's position that the Band was not recognized and under federal jurisdiction in 1934. <i>Id.</i> at 16. Nevertheless, after 1934, the Secretary has invoked his section 465 authority to take land into trust for the Band.</p>\n<p>The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians provides a similar example. The Secretary has taken land into trust for the Grand Traverse Band, which the Department of the Interior ceased to recognize in 1872. The Grand Traverse Band signed the 1855 Treaty of Detroit with the United States. In 1872, however, the then-Secretary of the Interior severed the United States' relationship <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> with the Band and ceased to treat the Band as a federally recognized tribe. <i>Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa &amp; Chippewa Indians v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></a></span>, 924 (W.D.Mich.2002) (\"Between 1872 and 1980, the Band continually sought to regain its status as a federally recognized tribe.\"). Yet, the Secretary has invoked his authority under section 465 to take twenty-one parcels of land into trust for the Band.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>The State also concedes that the Secretary appears to have taken land into trust for two tribes, the Tunica-Biloxi Indian Tribe and the Narragansetts themselves, that were not under federal jurisdiction in 1934 and for whom Congress has passed no specific act authorizing trust acquisitions. Even if we had no reason to doubt the State's argument that the Secretary has not historically taken land into trust for tribes not recognized in 1934, however, in at least some cases the Secretary has not looked to the status of the tribe in 1934 or to the specific statutory authority identified by the State in making the determination to take land into trust. In <i>Baker v. Muskogee Area Dir.,</i> 19 I.B.I.A. 164 (1991), for example, the IBIA, in concluding that particular members of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma were eligible to have land taken into trust, did not rely on the 1936 Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 501-570, which authorized the Secretary to take land into trust for Indians in Oklahoma. Rather, the IBIA stated that the Indians \"c[a]me within the IRA definition because they are members of a recognized Indian tribe under Federal jurisdiction.\" 19 I.B.I.A. at 179. The Secretary thus seems to have <i>intended</i> to exercise his section 465 authority to take land into trust on the basis of current federal recognition.</p>\n<p>The State has not met its burden of showing inconsistent interpretation by the Secretary. Moreover, even if the State had shown that the Secretary has changed his interpretation of section 479 over time, that would not necessarily resolve the matter in the State's favor. The <i>Chevron</i> doctrine permits the Secretary some ability to alter his interpretation over time. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> <i>See </i><i>Nat'l Cable &amp; Telecomms. Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Servs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799969\"><a href=\"/opinion/799969/national-cable-telecommunications-assn-v-brand-x-internet-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 981-82, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799969\"><a href=\"/opinion/799969/national-cable-telecommunications-assn-v-brand-x-internet-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">820</span></a></span> (2005) (under <i>Chevron,</i> an agency should have flexibility to vary its interpretation of a statute over time). The Secretary has given a reasoned explanation for his interpretation.</p>\n<p>We reject the State's argument that the Secretary has been inconsistent in his interpretation of section 479 and is therefore not entitled to deference.</p>\n<p>C. <i>The Settlement Act</i></p>\n<p>The State's next attack is to argue that the Settlement Act repealed the Secretary's trust authority as to all lands in Rhode Island. Alternatively, the State argues that the Settlement Act at least curtailed that authority so that any trust must preserve the State's civil and criminal jurisdiction over the Parcel.</p>\n<p>There is simply nothing in the text of the Settlement Act, however, that accomplishes such a repeal or curtailment of the Secretary's trust authority. 25 U.S.C. § 1708(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Except as otherwise provided in this [Act], the <i>settlement lands</i> shall be subject to the civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of the State of Rhode Island.</blockquote>\n<p>(emphasis added). The State would have us read the Act as if section 1708(a) applied to all lands the Tribe might ever acquire, either directly or as the beneficiary of a trust, but that is not what the section says. By its terms, section 1708(a) applies state law only to the 1800 acres of \"settlement lands.\" The Parcel is not part of the settlement lands. No other provision of the Settlement Act directly provides for state jurisdiction outside of the settlement lands. No language in the Act applies state law to lands the Tribe might later acquire. More importantly, no language explicitly curtails, or even references, the Secretary's power under the IRA to take lands into trust and thereby to create Indian country.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>The State's argument thus depends on finding that the Settlement Act <i>implicitly</i> repealed the IRA, at least in part.<sup>[12]</sup> The framework for evaluating such a claim of implicit repeal was set out by the Supreme Court in <i>Morton v. Mancari,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109067\"><a href=\"/opinion/109067/morton-v-mancari/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109067\"><a href=\"/opinion/109067/morton-v-mancari/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nothing in the Act explicitly curtails the Secretary's trust authority. The State offers two different lines of argument as to why provisions of the Act must be read to restrict that authority. One concerns how the Act affects the Tribe's rights; the other concerns how the Act affects the Secretary's authority. The provisions of the Settlement Act cited by the State, however, are most naturally read as merely resolving the claims that had clouded the titles of so much land in Rhode Island and that had led to the settlement embodied in the Act.</p>\n<p>As to the provisions affecting the Tribe, the State relies independently on the extinguishment of aboriginal title in 25 U.S.C. §§ 1705(a)(2) and 1712(a)(2) and the further extinguishment in sections 1705(a)(3) and 1712(a)(3) of \"all claims . . . based upon any interest in or right involving\" certain land or natural resources. These provisions, however, follow sections 1705(a)(1) and 1712(a)(1), respectively, which validate \"any transfer of land or natural resources\" in the United States by the Narragansett Tribe or in Rhode Island by any Indian tribe \"as of the date of said transfer.\"<sup>[13]</sup> The provisions then go on to state:</p>\n<blockquote>(2) [T]o the extent that any transfer of land or natural resources described in subsection (a) of this section may involve land or natural resources to which [an Indian tribe] had aboriginal title, subsection (a) of this section shall be regarded as an extinguishment of such aboriginal title as of the date of said transfer; and (3) by virtue of the approval of a transfer of land or natural resources effected by this section, or an extinguishment of aboriginal title effected thereby, all claims . . . by the [Narragansett Tribe], or any predecessor or successor in interest, member or stockholder thereof, or any other Indian, Indian nation, or tribe of Indians, arising subsequent to the transfer and based upon any interest in or right involving such land or natural resources (including but not limited to claims for trespass damages or claims for use and occupancy) shall be regarded as extinguished as of the date of the transfer.</blockquote>\n<p>25 U.S.C. § 1705(a). Given the references back to the transfers validated in paragraph (1), the evident purpose of these provisions is to extinguish claims based on the purported invalidity of those transfers.</p>\n<p>The State's arguments that the provisions should be read more broadly are unavailing. First, the State argues that the extinguishment of aboriginal title over land in Rhode Island precludes the later exercise of tribal sovereignty over Rhode Island land acquired by the Secretary in unrestricted trust. The Secretary disputes whether aboriginal title is ever the basis for tribal sovereignty, but in any event, it is clear that such title is not the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> only basis for tribal sovereignty. This is evident from the Supreme Court's decision in <i>City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142882\"><a href=\"/opinion/142882/city-of-sherrill-v-oneida-indian-nation-of-ny/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142882\"><a href=\"/opinion/142882/city-of-sherrill-v-oneida-indian-nation-of-ny/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1478</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142882\"><a href=\"/opinion/142882/city-of-sherrill-v-oneida-indian-nation-of-ny/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span> (2005). In <i>Sherrill,</i> the Supreme Court both held that \"the Tribe [could not] unilaterally revive its ancient sovereignty, in whole or in part, over the parcels at issue,\" <i>id.</i> at 202-03, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142882\"><a href=\"/opinion/142882/city-of-sherrill-v-oneida-indian-nation-of-ny/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1478</span></a></span>, and directed the Oneidas to 25 U.S.C. § 465 as \"the proper avenue for [the tribe] to reestablish sovereign authority over [the relevant] territory,\" <i>id.</i> at 221, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142882\"><a href=\"/opinion/142882/city-of-sherrill-v-oneida-indian-nation-of-ny/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1478</span></a></span>. The State's protestation that <i>Sherrill</i> did not involve a statutory extinguishment of aboriginal title is beside the point. However aboriginal title or ancient sovereignty was lost, the IRA provides an alternative means of establishing tribal sovereignty over land.</p>\n<p>Trust acquisition is not incompatible with the extinguishment of aboriginal title. The Mashantucket Pequot Indian Claims Settlement Act, for example, contains virtually identical language extinguishing aboriginal title \"to any land or natural resources the transfer of which was approved and ratified\" by the Act. 25 U.S.C. § 1753(b). At the same time, the Act provides that certain land and natural resources \"located within the settlement lands shall be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Tribe,\" <i>id.</i> § 1754(b)(7), and that such lands are \"declared to be Indian country,\" <i>id.</i> §§ 1752(7), 1755. It is implausible to think that Congress intended the extinguishment of aboriginal title in the Rhode Island Settlement Act to preclude the taking of land into unrestricted trust, but did not intend for identical language in the Mashantucket Settlement Act to do so.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>Alternatively, the State argues that the \"all claims\" language in paragraph (3) even more broadly forecloses the assertion of tribal sovereignty over non-settlement lands. To hold otherwise, says the State, would render that language surplusage. Paragraphs (2) and (3) are complementary, however, not duplicative. While paragraph (2) extinguishes a form of title, paragraph (3) extinguishes claims. Moreover, paragraph (3) covers claims based on other forms of title, besides aboriginal title, that the Tribe might have held to land in Rhode Island prior to the Settlement Act.</p>\n<p>The State's broad interpretation of paragraph (3) proves too much. The State argues that the paragraph precludes an assertion of tribal sovereignty over any land in Rhode Island. Nothing in the language of the provision, which refers to \"any interest in or right involving\" such land, distinguishes between claims of sovereignty and traditional property claims. Indeed, the latter are explicitly included. <i>See id.</i> § 1705(a)(3) (\"including but not limited to claims for trespass damages or claims for use and occupancy\"). It would be highly improbable that Congress intended to prevent the Tribe from asserting any ownership interest over land it purchased outside the settlement lands, and it would be contradictory as to the settlement lands themselves. Thus, there is no support for reading this provision as precluding all future assertions of tribal sovereignty over land in Rhode Island.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this entire line of argument by the State misses the point that what is at issue is not what the <i>Tribe</i> may do in the exercise of its rights, but what the <i>Secretary</i> may do. The displacement of state law arises from the Secretary's authority and not from the Tribe's mere purchase <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> of the land. <i>See </i><i>Cass County, Minn. v. Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118222\"><a href=\"/opinion/118222/cass-county-v-leech-lake-band-of-chippewa-indians/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 113-15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118222\"><a href=\"/opinion/118222/cass-county-v-leech-lake-band-of-chippewa-indians/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span> (1998). In order to prevail on its claim of implied repeal, the State must show that the Settlement Act repeals the Secretary's authority under the IRA.</p>\n<p>As to the implied repeal of the Secretary's power, the State first argues that the Secretary is bound by the extinguishment of the Tribe's claims because that extinguishment binds the Tribe's \"successor in interest.\" 25 U.S.C. § 1705(a)(2), (3). Even if the Secretary is such a \"successor in interest,\" however, those provisions cannot plausibly be read to repeal the Secretary's power under the IRA to take land into trust. The Secretary's power does not turn on the Tribe's original aboriginal interest in the Parcel, before it purchased the land, nor does it turn on whether the Secretary is a successor in interest to the Tribe.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>The State also relies on 25 U.S.C. § 1707(c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Upon the discharge of the Secretary's duties under sections 1704, 1705, 1706, and 1707 of this title, the United States shall have no further duties or liabilities under this subchapter with respect to the Indian Corporation or its successor, the State Corporation, or the settlement lands. . . .</blockquote>\n<p>The language of this provision, however, cannot be read to have a preclusive effect or to limit the Secretary's powers in any way. The statement that the United States has \"no further duties or liabilities under this subchapter\" merely delimits the federal government's obligations in implementing the Settlement Act.</p>\n<p>We reject the State's suggestion that this language parallels the language in the Mashantucket Settlement Act that the Second Circuit found to prohibit certain trust acquisitions. <i>See </i><i>Connecticut ex rel. Blumenthal v. U.S. Dep't of Interior,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770600\"><a href=\"/opinion/770600/state-of-connecticut-ex-rel-richard-blumenthal-attorney-general-town-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 88 (2d Cir.2000). The Mashantucket Settlement Act uses very different language that provides that \"the United States shall have no further trust responsibility with respect to [certain] land and natural resources\" outside of the settlement lands. 25 U.S.C. § 1754(b)(8). Disclaiming \"trust responsibility\" over land is nothing like disclaiming \"duties or liabilities under this subchapter.\"</p>\n<p>There is nothing in the text of the Settlement Act that clearly indicates an intent to repeal the Secretary's trust acquisition powers under the IRA, or that is fundamentally inconsistent with those powers.<sup>[16]</sup> This lack of language is not because either Congress or the parties failed to anticipate that the Tribe might later become federally recognized and eligible for the benefits of the IRA. The Settlement Act specifically provides for a restraint on alienation of the settlement lands \"if the Secretary subsequently acknowledges the existence of the Narragansett Tribe of Indians.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1707(c). The underlying <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> JMOU also explicitly recognized that the Tribe would \"not receive Federal recognition\" in the implementation of the settlement, but would \"have the same right to petition for such recognition . . . as other groups.\" JMOU para. 15.</p>\n<p>Had the Act intended to limit the Secretary's trust authority in case of federal recognition, it could have done so explicitly. It would have been easy to extend the provisions of section 1708(a) preserving state sovereignty to cover all lands in Rhode Island owned by or held in trust for the Tribe. No such language appears in the Act. Similarly, as the IBIA also noted, paragraph 15 of the JMOU would have been \"a logical place for the parties to set out any restrictions\" on the Secretary's trust authority following federal recognition of the Tribe. <i>Town of Charlestown,</i> 35 I.B.I.A. at 101. No such restrictions appear. Nor does the Settlement Act contemplate any role for the State to play in the Secretary's decision whether to take the land into trust. This is in contrast to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.</p>\n<p>In other settlement acts, Congress has specifically described limits on the Secretary's trust authority. In the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act, Congress expressly precluded application of section 465. 25 U.S.C. § 1724(e) (\"Except for the provisions of this [Act], the United States shall have no other authority to acquire lands or natural resources in trust for the benefit of Indians or Indian nations, or tribes, or bands of Indians in the State of Maine.\"). In the Mashantucket Settlement Act, Congress precluded the trust acquisition of non-settlement lands purchased with settlement funds. <i>See Blumenthal,</i> 228 F.3d at 88. The absence of any restrictions in the Settlement Act supports our finding that no restrictions were intended.<sup>[17]</sup><i>See id.</i> at 90.</p>\n<p>The State's fallback position is that the Settlement Act requires that this court order the Secretary to honor the intent of the bargain it believes is embodied in the Act by putting the Parcel into a restricted trust, subject to state laws and jurisdiction.<sup>[18]</sup> Acknowledging the genuineness of the State's sense that its bargain has been upset, we find that the relief it seeks is not an appropriate exercise of judicial power.</p>\n<p>In the Settlement Act, the State procured at least two clear benefits: (1) the settling of disputed land claims and (2) the application of its civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction to the settlement lands. Beyond that, the State argues that it would never have agreed to displacement of state law as to later acquired parcels if the issue had surfaced during the negotiations. The State argues that the practical consequences of the unrestricted trust leave it in an entirely unsatisfactory position and undermine the central bargain. Rhode Island points out that it is a small, very populous state and that the practical consequences of establishing Indian country for its nearby towns may be far greater <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> than they would be in less densely populated areas.</p>\n<p>Even so, we are still bound by the language of the Settlement Act. Even viewing the State's argument in contract terms, it is rare that a court will step in and reform a contract. <i>See </i><i>Broadley v. Mashpee Neck Marina, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202567\"><a href=\"/opinion/202567/broadley-v-mashpee-neck-marina/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span>, 275 (1st Cir.2006) (reversing the district court's reformation of a contract).

The judiciary may not usurp the role of Congress.</p>\n<p>D. <i>Constitutional Claims</i></p>\n<p>In support of recognition of its state sovereignty interests under the Constitution, the State presents four arguments. It argues first that the Indian Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3, does not provide the Secretary the authority to displace state law within a state's boundaries, and that section 465 of the IRA therefore violates the Tenth Amendment. Next, it argues that the Secretary may not, in any event, displace state law without the State's consent, by operation of the Enclave Clause of the Constitution. <i>Id.</i> art. I, § 8, cl. 17. The State further argues that the Secretary's action is barred by the Admissions Clause, <i>id.</i> art. IV, § 3, cl. 1, which prohibits formation of new states within the jurisdiction of any other state. Finally, the State argues that section 465 is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. We reject all of these arguments.</p>\n<p>1. <i>The Indian Commerce Clause and the Tenth Amendment</i></p>\n<p>The authority to regulate Indian affairs is within the enumerated powers of the federal government. <i>Id.</i> art.

Though tribes are often referred to as \"sovereign\" entities, it was \"long ago\" that \"the Court departed from Chief Justice Marshall's view that `the laws of [a State] can have no force' within reservation boundaries.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Hicks,</i> 533 U.S. at 361, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118454\"><a href=\"/opinion/118454/nevada-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As a result, the Secretary's trust acquisition of lands for the Narragansetts does not even implicate the Enclave Clause.</p>\n<p>3. <i>The Admissions Clause</i></p>\n<p>The Admissions Clause of the Constitution provides that \"no new state shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states, or parts of states, without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the Congress.\" U.S. Const. art.

The State argues that the creation of Indian country within Rhode Island <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> amounts to the formation of a new state within Rhode Island's jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>This argument is without merit. The Admissions Clause prohibits Congress only from unilaterally establishing within an existing state a body \"on an equal footing with the original states in all respects whatsoever.\" <i>Coyle v.

As the dissent from the original <i>South Dakota</i> decision had noted, the historical context of the IRA is important; section 465's \"direction that land be acquired `for the purpose of providing land for Indians[]' has specific meaning in light of the failure of the allotment policy and [c]ongressional rejection of assimilation as a goal.\" 69 F.3d at 887 (Murphy, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>Other provisions of the IRA reinforce such an interpretation. <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. § 461 (prohibiting allotment of reservation lands to individual Indians); <i>id.</i> § 462 (extending indefinitely existing trust periods and restrictions on alienation of Indian lands); <i>id.</i> § 463(a) (authorizing restoration of surplus lands to tribal ownership); <i>id.</i> § 464 (prohibiting the transfer of restricted Indian lands except to Indian tribes).

Although not addressing a nondelegation challenge to section 465, the <i>Confederated Tribes</i> court stated that \"[t]he general delegation of power to the Executive to take land into trust for the Indians is a valid delegation because Congress has decided under what <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> circumstances land should be taken into trust and has delegated to the Secretary of the Interior the task of deciding when this power should be used.\" <i>Id.</i> at 698.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of statutes authorizing regulation in the \"public interest,\" <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Nat'l Broad.

No deference is given to the district court's decision. <i>Associated Fisheries,</i> 127 F.3d at 109.</p>\n<p>The State makes five arguments as to why the Secretary's decision was unlawful under section 706(2)(A): (1) the BIA relied on the Tribe's findings, rather than conducting an independent evaluation of the Tribe's application; (2) the BIA misapplied the factors enumerated in 25 C.F.R. § 151.10 for evaluating a fee-to-trust transfer; (3) the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> Act cooperation agreement waiver violated due process; (4) the BIA failed to consider the environmental impact of the housing project planned for the Parcel and the project's compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act; and (5) the BIA failed to consider noncompliance with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. We disagree, and we find that the Secretary's decision to accept the Parcel into trust did not violate the APA.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Independent Evaluation of the Tribe's Trust Application</i></p>\n<p>The State claims that the BIA's decision to take the Parcel into trust was arbitrary and capricious because it relied exclusively on the Tribe's assertions and failed to consider other important facts that occurred between 1993 and 1997. The State points to substantial passages in the Secretary's decision that contain verbatim restatements of information provided by the Narragansett Tribe in support of their 1993 trust application as evidence that the BIA failed to conduct an independent evaluation of the Tribe's 1997 application.</p>\n<p>There is ample evidence in the administrative record that the BIA conducted its own, independent evaluation of the Tribe's application and that it considered the events following the Tribe's 1993 application. For example, between 1993 and 1997, the BIA required the Tribe to supplement its initial Environmental Assessment; conducted an environmental hazard survey of the Parcel; required confirmation of consistency with the State's Coastal Resources Management Plan; was apprised of, and offered to facilitate, negotiations between the Tribe, the Town, and the State concerning both environmental and jurisdictional issues attendant to the Tribe's development of the Parcel; and specifically requested that the Regional Solicitor address several legal and jurisdictional issues raised by the State in its comments to the BIA on the Tribe's trust application. This demonstrates that the BIA's determination was the result of its own, independent evaluation of the 1997 application.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Application of the 25 C.F.R. § 151.10 Factors</i></p>\n<p>The State claims that the BIA failed to apply the proper criteria when it evaluated the Tribe's application for trust acquisition. The regulations governing the BIA's evaluation of applications to have land taken in trust are laid out at 25 C.F.R. part 151. The factors to be considered for an on-reservation acquisition are found in section 151.10, and the factors for an off-reservation acquisition are found in section 151.11.<sup>[21]</sup> In making the decision to accept the Parcel into trust, the BIA considered the on-reservation factors in section 151.10.<sup>[22]</sup> The State claims that the BIA <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> failed to consider \"the need of . . . the tribe for additional land,\" 25 C.F.R. § 151.10(b). The State also questions whether the BIA sufficiently scrutinized \"the tribe's justification of anticipated benefits from the acquisition\" as required by section 151.11(b).<sup>[23]</sup></p>\n<p>A reviewing court will determine only \"whether the [BIA's] decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\" <i>Citizens To Preserve Overton Park,</i> 401 U.S. at 416, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108283\"><a href=\"/opinion/108283/citizens-to-preserve-overton-park-inc-v-volpe/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">814</span></a></span>. The fact that the BIA found the Parcel, which is across a town road from the settlement lands, to be \"contiguous\" to the settlement lands that are currently in trust, and thus determined that it should consider the \"on-reservation\" factors enumerated in 25 C.F.R. § 151.10, is certainly not clear error and is within the Secretary's discretion. The record shows that the BIA complied with section 151.10, including evaluating the Tribe's need for the additional land, and the State has not shown that the Secretary made a clear error of judgment.</p>\n<p>It was not necessary for the BIA to consider the factors under section 151.11, since it found section 151.10 to be applicable to this trust determination. While the Secretary need not have considered section 151.11(b), the close proximity between the Tribe's settlement lands and the Parcel would not have required the Secretary to give the greatest scrutiny to the \"tribe's justification of anticipated benefits from the acquisition.\" 25 C.F.R. § 151.11(b).</p>\n<p>3. <i>The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act Cooperation Agreement Requirement</i></p>\n<p>At the time of the BIA's decision to acquire the Parcel into trust, HUD was precluded from releasing funds pursuant to the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act for any tribe's housing development unless an agreement for local cooperation on issues such as taxes and jurisdiction had been entered into by the tribe and the local government where the housing was located. 25 U.S.C. § 4111(c). In the instant case, the Narragansett Tribe did not obtain such an agreement with the Town. However, section 4111(c) has since been amended to permit HUD to waive the cooperation agreement requirement, 25 U.S.C. § 4111(c), <i>as amended by</i> Pub.L. No. 106-569, § 503(a)(2), 114 Stat. 2944, 2962 (2000), and the Tribe claims to have obtained such a waiver.</p>\n<p>The State argues that this waiver is invalid because the State apparently did not receive notice of the Tribe's application for a waiver until after the waiver had been granted. On appeal, the State contends that if the BIA accepted the waiver, the BIA has inherited the legal error and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner. As the district court noted, \"25 U.S.C. § 4111(c) establishes a prerequisite to HUD's award of housing grants. It does not pertain to the BIA's trust acquisition authority.\" <i>Carcieri,</i> 290 F.Supp.2d at 178. Nothing in the § 151.10 factors requires the BIA to ensure that a local cooperation agreement is in place for an Indian Housing project.</p>\n<p>4. <i>Environmental Considerations</i></p>\n<p>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321-4370(f), and its supporting regulations promulgated by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), 40 C.F.R. parts 1500-1518, direct federal agencies to consider the environmental impact of agency decisions. The State argues that the Secretary and the BIA (1) failed to consider the environmental impact in reaching the decision to accept the Parcel into trust because no Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was prepared, and (2) failed to conduct their own evaluation of the environmental impact and instead improperly relied on an Environmental Assessment (EA) submitted by the Narragansett Tribe. We disagree.</p>\n<p>Federal agencies are required to prepare an EIS for any action that could significantly affect the quality of the human environment. 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C); 40 C.F.R. § 1502.3. NEPA provides that \"to the fullest extent possible . . . all agencies of the Federal Government shall . . . include in every recommendation or report on proposals for . . . major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on . . . the environmental impact of the proposed action.\" 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C). However, in the absence of a finding that the proposed action would significantly affect the quality of the human environment, the BIA was not required to prepare an EIS. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Londonderry Neighborhood Coal. v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199723\"><a href=\"/opinion/199723/londonderry-neighbor-v-ferc/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">416</span></a></span>, 419 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>Wyo. Outdoor Council v. U.S. Forest Serv.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184751\"><a href=\"/opinion/184751/wy-outdoor-cncl-v-us-forest-svc/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 49 (D.C.Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p>The CEQ has issued guidance on whether to prepare an EIS. This guidance provides that \"if the agency determines on the basis of the environmental assessment not to prepare a statement,\" then the agency should \"[p]repare a finding of no significant impact\" pursuant to section 1508.13. 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(e). The applicant may prepare the EA provided that the agency \"make[s] its own evaluation of the environmental issues and take[s] responsibility for the scope and content of the environmental assessment.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1506.5(b). In this case, the BIA followed its standard operating procedure for externally initiated proposals by obtaining an EA from the Tribe and considering it along with supplemental information the BIA requested from the Tribe and information gathered independently by the BIA. <i>See NEPA Handbook</i> para. 4.2.B. After reviewing the EA and the requisite supplemental information, the BIA completed its environmental analysis and issued a finding of no significant impact. The BIA's issuance of a finding of no significant impact satisfied its responsibilities under NEPA. <i>See</i> 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(e).</p>\n<p>Separately, the State contends that the BIA should have obtained a federal consistency review in accordance with the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), 16 U.S.C. §§ 1451-1465, before making its trust determination. The CZMA requires state consultation on federally permitted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> coastal development activities.<sup>[24]</sup> The State asserts that the BIA's failure to take direct action to ensure that the housing project was consistent with the Rhode Island Coastal Zone Management Program (RICZMP) before making its trust determination was a violation of the CZMA. We disagree.</p>\n<p>The State has failed to demonstrate that a consistency review of the Tribe's housing development was necessary at the trust acquisition stage. The development of the Parcel is a project that was commenced by the Tribe, in conjunction with HUD, prior to the Tribe's application for trust acquisition. The Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council correctly recognized that the development of the Parcel, which required its own federal consistency determination, was a separate matter from the trust acquisition, and properly found that the Tribe's application for trust status was consistent with the RICZMP.</p>\n<p>5. <i>The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act</i></p>\n<p>Finally, the State contends that the true purpose of the Tribe's application for trust acquisition is the development of gambling facilities on the Parcelrather than development of tribal housing as the BIA found in its evaluation pursuant to 25 C.F.R. § 151.10(c)and that the BIA's failure to consider the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 2701-2721, in its decision was an abuse of discretion. We reject the State's argument that the Secretary's decision to acquire the Parcel in trust should be reversed and that further inquiry into whether the Parcel would be used for gaming purposes is now required.</p>\n<p>No evidence that the Tribe intends to use the Parcel for anything other than tribal housing, as determined by the BIA, was presented. \"In fact, after the plaintiffs expressed concern over the potential for development of a gaming facility on the parcel, the tribe reaffirmed that it intended to use the parcel for a housing development and stated that it had `no immediate plans for any further future development.'\" <i>Carcieri,</i> 290 F.Supp.2d at 178 (quoting II Admin. Rec., tab N).</p>\n<p>As support for its position, the State points to an IBIA decision that reversed a trust acquisition decision due to the BIA's failure to consider the impact of a potential casino, even though the applicants denied any intention of using the property for a casino. <i>See </i><i>Vill. of Ruidoso, N.M. v. Albuquerque Area Dir., Bureau of Indian Affairs,</i> 32 I.B.I.A. 130 (1998). However, in <i>Village of Ruidoso,</i> the IBIA determined that, despite the tribe's denial that the application for trust acquisition was for gaming purposes, it was clear from the planned gaming-related uses of the property and the fact that the property had been given to the tribe by a company that the BIA \"apparently understood to have some gaming connection with the Tribe\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> that the application might well have been for gaming purposes. <i>Id.</i> at 136. In that situation, the BIA should have further analyzed the possibility of gaming. <i>Id.</i> at 140.</p>\n<blockquote>We agree with the district court that</blockquote>\n<blockquote>although the possibility that the parcel might be used for gaming activities was raised before the BIA, the bureau's determination that the parcel would be used to provide housing was amply supported by the record. In view of the deferential standard of review afforded to agency decisions under the APA, the bureau's determination in this regard must be sustained.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Carcieri,</i> 290 F.Supp.2d at 178.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The decision of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i> Costs are awarded to the Secretary.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Respectfully, I disagree with the majority's analysis of the Settlement Act. In my view, the majority opinion disregards Congress's (and the parties') purpose in passing the Settlement Act and is inconsistent with our own recent interpretation of the Settlement Act. <i>See </i><i>Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Rhode Island,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></span> (1st Cir.2006) (en banc). At bottom, under the Settlement Act, the Secretary may only take the Parcel into a restricted trust<sup>[25]</sup> that provides for Rhode Island's continued criminal and civil jurisdiction over the Parcel. The State makes this argument in two forms. First, by arguing that the Settlement Act effectuates a partial implied repeal of the IRA as to state jurisdiction on land taken into trust by the BIA. Second, by arguing that the statutes can be harmonized by reading the IRA narrowly and subject to the Settlement Act's provisions. Either approach gets to the same conclusion. Significantly, the generous rules of \"Indian construction\" do not apply in analyzing an implied repeal. <i>See </i><i>Passamaquoddy Tribe v. State of Maine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196568\"><a href=\"/opinion/196568/passamaquoddy-tribe-v-state-of-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span>, 790 (1st Cir.1996) (the normal principles of implied repeal are applied in the Indian law context).</p>\n<p>The parties and amici do an excellent job in acquainting the court with the many complexities of both the case and the issues inherent in \"Indian law.\" However, the ultimate resolution of the case comes down to a very narrow question: In the specific context of the Tribe and State, what did Congress intend the Settlement Act to do?</p>\n<p>The key provision is Section 1705, which is written far more broadly than the majority concludes.<sup>[26]</sup> In its first two provisions that section retroactively ratifies all the Tribe's prior land transfers anywhere in the United States and extinguishes the Tribe's aboriginal title in all such lands. <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. § 1705(a)(1) &amp; (2). More significantly, Section 1705 goes on to extinguish future land claims:</p>\n<blockquote>(3)by virtue of the approval of a transfer of land or natural resources effected by this section, or an extinguishment of aboriginal title effected thereby, all claims against the United States, any State or subdivision thereof, or any other person or entity, by the Indian Corporation or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> any other entity presently or at any time in the past known as the Narragansett Tribe of Indians, or any predecessor or successor in interest, member of stockholder thereof, or any other Indian, Indian nation, or tribe of Indians, arising subsequent to the transfer and based upon any interest in or right involving such land or natural resources (including but not limited to claims for trespass damages or claims for use and occupancy) shall be regarded as extinguished as of the date of the transfer.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 1705(a)(3). This provision obviously goes well beyond merely extinguishing aboriginal title (and claims based thereon), which was accomplished in the prior subsection. <i>See id.</i> § 1705(a)(2). This language forecloses any future \"Indian\" land claim of any type by the Tribe regarding land in Rhode Island (or anywhere in the United States, for that matter). Thus, Congress (and the parties) intended to resolve all the Tribe's land claims in the state once and for all.</p>\n<p>The majority argues that Section 1705(a)(3) cannot be read so broadly; otherwise, the Tribe would be barred from asserting any land claims. <i>See ante,</i> at 36-37. But the majority disregards a significant factorthe nature of the land claims that were barred. The legislative history of the Settlement Act specifically states that the \"extinguishment of Indian land claims is limited to those claims raised by Indians qua Indians.\" H.R. Rep. 95-1453, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, 1948, at 1955 (1978) (emphasis added). As we recently stated, through the Settlement Act \"the Tribe abandoned any right to an autonomous enclave, submitting itself to state law as a quid pro quo for obtaining the land that it cherished.\" <i>Narragansett Tribe,</i> 449 F.3d at 22. Thus, the Tribe would be free to assert any claim that any other landowner in Rhode Island could make under state law, but would be foreclosed from making claims based entirely on the Tribe's status as an Indian tribe. It is beyond peradventure that asking to have land taken into trust by the BIA under the IRA to effect an ouster of state jurisdiction is a quintessential \"Indian\" land claim.<sup>[27]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, \"Congress does not legislate in a vacuum,\" and among the matters that a court must consider in assessing a statute are general policies and pre-existing statutory provisions. <i>Passamaquoddy Tribe,</i> 75 F.3d at 789. The Settlement Act was enacted over 40 years after Section 465 of the IRA and, given the explicit acknowledgment of possible future recognition for the Tribe,<sup>[28]</sup> Congress was well aware of the IRA when enacting the Settlement Act. It is neither logical nor necessary to find that Congress enacted legislation effectuating this carefully calibrated compromise between three sovereigns, which required significant expenditures by both the federal government and the State, which provided a significant amount of land to the Tribe, and which provided for a delicate balancing of the parties' interests, only to permit the legislation to be completely subverted by subsequent agency action.</p>\n<p>On this score, the majority misses the exquisite irony that the Parcel was part of the lands originally claimed by the Tribe. It would be antithetical to Congress' intent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> to allow the Tribe to purchase a portion of the originally disputed lands that were the subject of the earlier lawsuits that ultimately led to the JMOU and Settlement Act, place it in trust with the BIA, and thereby create \"Indian country\" in direct contravention of the Settlement Act's prohibitions. For this same reason, the majority's attempt to distinguish our recent <i>Narragansett Tribe</i> opinion as pertaining only to the \"Settlement Lands\" is unpersuasive. <i>See ante,</i> at 34 n. 11. By that reasoning, the Tribe could swap the Settlement Lands for adjacent land and undo any limitations contained in the Settlement Act. The Settlement Act cannot be reasonably construed to allow such absurd results.</p>\n<p>Further, the Settlement Act was novel; it was the first statute resolving Indian land claims, premised upon the Nonintercourse Act, growing out of an out-of-court settlement negotiated by a tribe and the state/landowners. <i>See</i> H.R. 95-1453, at 1951 (1978). Indeed, it was expected to serve as a template for the resolution of other Eastern tribes' land claims under the Nonintercourse Act. <i>See id.; see also </i><i>Oneida Indian Nation,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 1483-85 (discussing Nonintercourse Act and original 13 states' \"pre-emptive right to purchase from the Indians\"). In light of the fact that the Settlement Act was the first statute of its kind, the majority's observation that subsequent statutes were more explicit in limiting certain aspects of the Secretary's power proves nothing. Elaborate statements regarding the Tribe's relationship with the BIA would have been unwarranted in the Settlement Act, given that the Tribe had not yet been recognized.</p>\n<p>Moreover, that subsequent acts dealing with Eastern tribes made specific provision for the Secretary's ability to take land in trust for a tribe, <i>see, e.g.,</i> 25 U.S.C. § 1771d(c) &amp; (d) (Massachusetts Indian Claims Settlement); <i>id.</i> § 1724(d) (Maine Indian Claims Settlement); <i>id.</i> § 1754(b) (Connecticut Indian Claims Settlement), supports the conclusion that Congress anticipated no such result under the Settlement Act. Given that the State had full criminal and civil jurisdiction over its territory, that any potential jurisdictional issue concerning the Settlement Lands was specifically addressed, and that all future Indian land claims were barred, there would be no future land scenarios that Congress would need to address more specifically (as it did in the other acts).<sup>[29]</sup> As we have noted, \"the Settlement Act, properly read, ensures that the State may demand the Tribe's compliance with state laws of general application.\" <i>Narragansett Tribe,</i> 449 F.3d at 26.</p>\n<p>There is also nothing novel about requiring the BIA to accept the Parcel into trust with restrictions. The BIA is authorized to take restricted interests in land into trust, <i>see</i> 25 U.S.C. § 465, and, in dealing with other tribes, Congress has specifically directed the BIA to take land into trust subject to a settlement act's provisions, <i>see, e.g., id.</i> § 1771d(d); <i>id.</i> § 1773b.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting that Congress acted promptly to preserve the State's jurisdiction over the Tribe's lands the last time this court challenged it. When this court held that the Tribe exercised sufficient <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> jurisdiction and governmental authority over the Settlement Lands to invoke the Indian Regulatory Gaming Act, <i>see Narragansett Tribe,</i> 19 F.3d at 703, Congress promptly amended the Settlement Act to provide explicitly that the Settlement Lands are not \"Indian lands\" for purposes of that Act, <i>see</i> 25 U.S.C. § 1708(b).</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I am in complete agreement with Judge Howard's cogent and articulate dissent, and I join it unreservedly. Nevertheless, I write separately to express my regret that, in taking far too narrow a view of the Settlement Act, the majority gives short shrift not only to the interests of the State of Rhode Island but also to the carefully calibrated arrangements crafted between the State and the Tribe.</p>\n<p>We previously have made clear that the touchstone in resolving jurisdictional disputes between the State and the Tribe is the full effectuation of the parties' intent. <i>See </i><i>Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Rhode Island,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></span>, 22, 25 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc). Yet, today, the majority sets aside the parties' intent in favor of a wooden reading of one subsection of the Settlement Act. <i>See ante</i> at 34 (\"By its terms, section 1708(a) applies state law only to the 1800 acres of `settlement lands.' The Parcel is not part of the settlement lands.\").</p>\n<p>Despite the artful draftmanship of the majority opinion, the provision on which it relies cannot be wrested from its historical context and read in a vacuum. The Settlement Act, when taken together with the extinguishment of all Indian claims referable to lands in Rhode Island, the Tribe's surrender of its right to an autonomous enclave, and the waiver of much of its sovereign immunity, <i>see </i><i>Narragansett Indian Tribe,</i> 449 F.3d at 22, 24-25, suggests with unmistakable clarity that the parties intended to fashion a broad arrangement that preserved the State's civil, criminal, and regulatory jurisdiction over any and all lands within its borders. Therefore, the Settlement Act logically and equitably should be read to prohibit <i>any</i> unilateral action that would upset this hard-bargained and delicate jurisdictional balance.</p>\n<p>The Secretary's taking of an after-acquired parcel into an unrestricted trust is just such an event. It strains credulity to surmise, as does the majority, that the State would have made such substantial concessionsincluding the transfer, free and clear, of 1800 acres of its landwhile leaving open the gaping loophole that today's decision creates.</p>\n<p>The majority admits that this case is \"in many ways a proxy for the State's larger concerns about its sovereignty,\" <i>ante</i> at 20, including the State's understandable worry that the Tribe will use this parcel (or future parcels that might be acquired and placed into trust) for activities that would be forbidden under State law and anathema to a majority of the State's citizens. At oral argument, the Secretary of the Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs appeared to disclaim any vestige of responsibility for the State's concerns. Despite this disclaimer and \"the genuineness of the State's sense that its bargain has been upset,\" <i>ante</i> at 38, the majority turns its back on the State.</p>\n<p>In my view, this is errorand error of the most deleterious kind. The majority, without anything approaching sufficient justification, is engaging in pointless literalism and forcing the State to rely on the faint velleity that the Secretary will use caution in the exercise of his responsibilities in connection with the Parcel. While <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> \"hope\" is the official motto of Rhode Island, the State should not be force-fed hope in place of rights for which it has bargained.</p>\n<p>As Indian tribes evolve in modern society, old legal rules tend to blur. The controversy that divides our court today is vexing and of paramount importance to both the State and the Tribe. Thus, the issueas well as the underlying principles of Indian lawdoubtless would benefit from consideration by the Supreme Court. That is a consummation devoutly to be wished. In the meantime, however, there is too much at stake to allow the Tribe, with the contrivance of the Secretary's taking the Parcel into trust, to walk away from an arrangement that it helped to fashion and from which it has benefitted over the years.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Defendant Gale A. Norton has been substituted with Dirk Kempthorne. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2).</p>\n<p>[1]  By contrast, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act provides the State with a limited role in determining whether land is taken into trust for gaming purposes. <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. § 2719(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>[2]  The State's challenges to the Secretary's authority under the IRA and the Constitution have national implications that reach beyond Rhode Island; accordingly, ten states and the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion have filed amicus briefs in support of Rhode Island. Similarly, numerous tribes and tribal organizations have filed amicus briefs in support of the Secretary. We acknowledge the able assistance provided by the amici curiae states and National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion on behalf of the State, and amici curiae National Congress of American Indians, individual Indian tribes and tribal organizations, and the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians on behalf of the Secretary.</p>\n<p>[3]  In \"an abundance of caution,\" we recognized that the Tribe may still possess some autonomy in local government matters such as membership rules, inheritance rules, and regulation of domestic relations. <i>Narragansett III,</i> 449 F.3d at 26.</p>\n<p>[4]  The Housing Authority was a duly recognized Indian housing authority and was given HUD funds to finance the purchase of the property and the construction of approximately 50 units of housing. <i>See</i> Indian Housing Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1437aa-1437ff (<i>repealed by</i> Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996, 25 U.S.C. §§ 4101-4243).\n</p>\n<p>The district court found the proposed housing project could be detrimental to coastal and groundwater resources, but also held that the Parcel was a \"dependent Indian community\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1151(b) and therefore partially denied injunctive relief. <i>Narragansett Elec. Co.,</i> 878 F.Supp. at 355-57, 366. On appeal, this court held that the land for the housing project was not a \"dependent Indian community\" because federal ownership of the land and federal action to \"set aside\" the land were lacking. <i>Narragansett II,</i> 89 F.3d at 921-22. Thus, the Parcel could not be considered Indian country under 18 U.S.C. § 1151(b), and the housing project being constructed on the site was not exempt from state and local building and zoning restrictions. Accordingly, this court reversed the district court and directed the district court to enter an order granting the injunction. 89 F.3d at 922.</p>\n<p>[5]  The IBIA rejected the State's insistence that the Secretary take account of the potential use of the Parcel for gaming purposes under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. § 2701, calling such a possibility merely speculative. 35 I.B.I.A. at 103. The IBIA also concluded that there had been no violation of the Coastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. § 1451. 35 I.B.I.A. at 103.</p>\n<p>[6]  At oral argument, the Secretary indicated that although a tribe has civil regulatory jurisdiction over lands taken into trust, a state may seek to enforce its lawsto the extent they are not preempted by federal lawon trust lands either by agreement with the tribe or by seeking a determination in federal court that the State's interests with respect to enforcing a particular regulation outweigh the interests of the tribe and the federal government in fostering tribal self-government. <i>See </i><i>Hicks,</i> 533 U.S. at 362, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118454\"><a href=\"/opinion/118454/nevada-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That issue is beyond the scope of this opinion.</p>\n<p>[7]  We reject two additional arguments offered by the State. First, it is not significant that 25 U.S.C. § 478 required tribes to opt out of the IRA by a fixed date, rather than one that depended on the date of recognition. In general, it is difficult to see why any tribe would opt out of a statute designed to benefit it, and the legislative history suggests that the provision was a legacy from earlier drafts of the bill that imposed duties on tribes in return for the benefits. <i>See Hearing on S.2755 and S.3645, supra,</i> at 262. As eventually passed, the only potential purpose of the election was to protect the rights of those that preferred the allotment system, an issue not relevant to tribes recognized after 1934.\n</p>\n<p>Second, we hesitate to attach much weight to the fact that later Congresses have explicitly provided for the IRA to apply to newly recognized tribes. As the Supreme Court has recently cautioned again, the views of later Congresses carry little weight in determining the intent of the Congress that enacted the statute in question. <i>See </i><i>Massachusetts v. EPA,</i> ___ U.S. ____, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145749\"><a href=\"/opinion/145749/massachusetts-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span> (2007). For the same reason, we do not take later enactments such as the 1994 amendments to section 476 to establish that Congress intended to make no distinctions among tribes in 1934. The parties have not pointed us to contemporaneous legislation that sheds further light on the issue.</p>\n<p>[8]  One difficulty arises from the fact that there seems to be no comprehensive list of tribes that were recognized and under federal jurisdiction as of June 18, 1934.</p>\n<p>[9]  The Secretary's interpretation also is consistent with regulations interpreting and implementing other federal statutes establishing Indian programs and services. For example, the applicability of the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1901-1963, the applicability of minimum standards for basic education of Indian children in schools operated by the BIA, <i>id.</i> § 2001, and eligibility for Indian financial assistance and social services programs, <i>id.</i> § 13, all are defined in terms of current federal recognition. <i>See</i> 25 C.F.R. § 23.2; <i>id.</i> § 36.3; <i>id.</i> § 20.100.</p>\n<p>[10]  Indian amici also submitted opinions of the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior discussing various tribes' eligibility to organize under the IRA as evidence that the Secretary has consistently interpreted \"now\" in section 479 to mean \"today.\" The State's attempt to distinguish these opinions is unsuccessful. For example, in discussing the IRA eligibility of the St. Croix Indians of Wisconsin, the Solicitor makes no mention whatsoever of the tribe's status as of 1934. Solicitor's Opinion, Jan. 29, 1941, 1 <i>Op. Sol. on Indian Affairs</i> 1026 (1979). The State argues that it is clear from context that the tribe was not recognized as of 1934. Yet, although this is true, the Solicitor discusses the fact that the tribe has never had a separate tribal status, and that <i>until it does so,</i> only those Indians who meet the half-blood test are eligible to organize under the IRA. <i>Id.</i> at 1027. Moreover, contrary to the State's position, the Solicitor's opinion indicates that if the tribe takes certain steps, it may later become eligible to organize under the IRA as a recognized band. <i>Id.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Similarly, in discussing the Nahma and Beaver Island Indians' eligibility to organize under the IRA, the Solicitor discusses the tribe's historical status, but then continues to discuss its then-current situation. Solicitor's Opinion, May 31, 1937, 1 <i>Op. Sol. on Indian Affairs</i> 747, 747-48 (1979). If the Solicitor had been concerned only with the tribe's status as of 1934, there would have been no reason for him to have considered the \"recent . . . attitude of the Interior Department on the band status\" of the Nahma and Beaver Indians, nor for him to state that it was \"out of the question to establish any existing band status\" before concluding that the Indians were eligible for organization only under the IRA's half-blood provision. <i>Id.</i> at 748.</p>\n<p>[11]  Nor is this case controlled by our en banc decision in <i>Narragansett III.</i> That case concerned the State's jurisdiction over the settlement lands, <i>see</i> 449 F.3d at 20, and has no bearing on whether the Settlement Act abrogates the Secretary's trust authority outside of the settlement lands. Similarly, cases holding that section 1708(a) survived federal recognition and the conveyance of the settlement lands to federal trust are of no help to the State, since section 1708(a) refers only to the settlement lands. <i>See </i><i>Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Nat'l Indian Gaming Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184663\"><a href=\"/opinion/184663/narrangansett-tribe-v-natl-indian-cmsn/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1335</span></a></span>, 1341-42 (D.C.Cir.1998); <i>Narragansett I,</i> 19 F.3d at 694-95.</p>\n<p>[12]  The State adds nothing to its argument by also styling it as an issue of claim preclusion. Obviously, the earlier litigation that resulted in the Settlement Act could not have resolved the question raised in this case of whether the Settlement Act restricts the Secretary's trust authority under the IRA. By invoking \"principles of res judicata,\" the State means nothing more than that the Tribe should be held to the settlement to which it previously agreed. What precisely the Tribe agreed to in the settlement is, of course, the question we are addressing.</p>\n<p>[13]  Section 1705 applies to the Narragansett Tribe and any land in Charlestown, Rhode Island. Section 1712 applies to land elsewhere in Rhode Island transferred by other Indian tribes. The relevant provisions in each are materially the same for our purposes here.</p>\n<p>[14]  We attach little significance to the fact that the Mashantucket Settlement Act explicitly authorizes trust acquisition, while the Rhode Island Settlement Act does not. The former, unlike the latter, granted federal recognition to the tribe. <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. § 1758(a).</p>\n<p>[15]  We do not accept the State's comparison of the Rhode Island Settlement Act to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), 43 U.S.C. §§ 1601-1629h, and the resulting suggestion that trust acquisition would be as inappropriate in Rhode Island as it purportedly would be in Alaska. ANCSA eliminated previously existing Indian country in Alaska. <i>See Native Vill. of Venetie,</i> 522 U.S. at 532-34, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></span>. Even if one might infer from that elimination an intent to preclude later trust acquisitions, no such intent can be inferred from the Rhode Island Settlement Act's failure to affirmatively establish Indian country for an as-yet unrecognized tribe.</p>\n<p>[16]  The State has not cited any legislative history that might lead us to interpret the text differently.</p>\n<p>[17]  There are also other examples of Congress's imposing explicit conditions on the taking of land into trust, for example, by limiting the number of acres of land and the number of acre feet of water rights. <i>See </i><i>Nevada v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2486260\"><a href=\"/opinion/2486260/nevada-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1241</span></a></span>, 1244 (D.Nev.2002) (discussing section 103(A) of the Fallon Paiute Shoshone Indian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 1990, Pub.L. No. 101-618, 104 Stat. 3289, 3291).</p>\n<p>[18]  The Secretary takes the position that he has no authority to impose restrictions on land taken into trust under the IRA, absent a statutory directive imposing such restrictions. We do not reach this issue. To the extent that the State argues that the Settlement Act itself is such a statutory directive requiring a restricted trust, we reject that argument for the same reasons that we found that the Settlement Act does not eliminate trust authority altogether.</p>\n<p>[19]  In so holding, the Eighth Circuit agreed with the Tenth Circuit's decision in <i>United States v. Roberts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158305\"><a href=\"/opinion/158305/united-states-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1125</span></a></span> (10th Cir. 1999), which held that section 465 contains standards sufficient to guide the Secretary's exercise of discretion. <i>Id.</i> at 1137.</p>\n<p>[20]  Amici states argue that legislative history should not factor into the intelligible principle analysis. We note simply that the Supreme Court in <i>Mistretta</i> referred to legislative history in explaining that the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. <i>See</i> 488 U.S. at 375 n. 9, 376 n. 10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112173\"><a href=\"/opinion/112173/mistretta-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">647</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>[21]  For the purpose of 25 C.F.R. part 151, land is considered to be on-reservation if it is \"located within or contiguous to an Indian reservation,\" 25 C.F.R. § 151.10, and off-reservation where \"the land is located outside of and noncontiguous to the tribe's reservation,\" <i>id.</i> § 151.11. The State challenges the finding by the BIA and the district court that the Parcel is adjacent to the settlement lands, yet recognizes that this determination is insignificant to the application of either section in this case, as the sections differ only slightly. <i>Compare id.</i> § 151.10, <i>with id.</i> § 151.11. The Parcel is adjacent to the Settlement Lands, but separated from them by a town road. <i>Narragansett II,</i> 89 F.3d at 911.</p>\n<p>[22]  Those factors include:\n</p>\n<p>(a) The existence of statutory authority for the acquisition and any limitations contained in such authority;</p>\n<p>(b) The need of the individual Indian or the tribe for additional land;</p>\n<p>(c) The purposes for which the land will be used;</p>\n<p>. . .</p>\n<p>(e) If the land to be acquired is in unrestricted fee status, the impact on the State and its political subdivisions resulting from the removal of the land from the tax rolls;</p>\n<p>(f) Jurisdictional problems and potential conflicts of land use which may arise; and</p>\n<p>(g) If the land to be acquired is in fee status, whether the Bureau of Indian Affairs is equipped to discharge the additional responsibilities resulting from the acquisition of the land in trust status.</p>\n<p>. . . .</p>\n<p>25 C.F.R. § 151.10.</p>\n<p>[23]  The criteria to be considered pursuant to section 151.11(b) are as follows:\n</p>\n<p>The location of the land relative to state boundaries, and its distance from the boundaries of the tribe's reservation, shall be considered as follows: as the distance between the tribe's reservation and the land to be acquired increases, the Secretary shall give greater scrutiny to the tribe's justification of anticipated benefits from the acquisition. . . .</p>\n<p>25 C.F.R. § 151.11(b).</p>\n<p>[24]  Specifically, 16 U.S.C. § 1456(c) provides, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>(1)(A) Each Federal agency activity within or outside the coastal zone that affects any land or water use or natural resource of the coastal zone shall be carried out in a manner which is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the enforceable policies of approved State management programs. A Federal agency activity shall be subject to this paragraph unless it is subject to paragraph (2) or (3).</p>\n<p>. . . .</p>\n<p>(C) Each Federal agency carrying out an activity subject to paragraph (1) shall provide a consistency determination to the relevant State agency. . . .</p>\n<p>(2) Any Federal agency which shall undertake any development project in the coastal zone of a state shall insure that the project is, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with the enforceable policies of approved State management programs.</p>\n<p>[25]  I do not challenge the majority's conclusion that the BIA may take the Parcel into trust, as the State previously permitted the Narragansetts to take the Settlement Lands into trust in 1988. But any new trust lands must also be explicitly made subject to the State's criminal and civil laws.</p>\n<p>[26]  Indeed, the very breadth of the language indicates more was contemplated by the parties than merely resolving an immediate dispute over title.</p>\n<p>[27]  The Tribe would still have the option of obtaining the State's consent to make certain Indian land claimssuch as the 1988 placement of the settlement lands in trust (subject to Rhode Island law) with the BIA.</p>\n<p>[28]  The Tribe's recognition by the BIA changed little, as this court has held that the jurisdictional grant to the State in the Settlement Act survived such recognition. <i>See </i><i>Narragansett Indian Tribe,</i> 19 F.3d at 694-95.</p>\n<p>[29]  In extinguishing the Tribe's aboriginal title in the Settlement Act, Congress was inspired by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (\"ANCSA\"). <i>See</i> H.R. Rep. 95-1453, at 1951. As noted by the Supreme Court, the ANCSA sought to accomplish this goal \"without creating a reservation system or lengthy wardship or trusteeship.\" <i>Alaska v.
