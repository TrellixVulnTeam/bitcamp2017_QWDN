Bueker, with whom Ropes & Gray LLP and Bradford E.\nSteiner were on brief, for petitioner.\n\n     Alison Marie Igoe, with whom Peter D. Keisler, Assistant\nAttorney General, Civil Division, and Michael P. Lindemann,\nAssistant Director, Office of Immigration Litigation, were on\nbrief, for respondent.\n\n\n\n                         February 25, 2004\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.              Jose Teodoro Navarro-Chalan, a\n\nnative and citizen of Peru, was arrested by INS agents on February\n\n20, 1996 for having overstayed his permission to be in this\n\ncountry.     He was ordered deported in August 1998, and the BIA\n\naffirmed that order in March 2003.              Navarro has never argued that\n\nhe should be allowed to stay in the United States because he is\n\nlegally    here;   he   argues   only     that    the   INS   arrest   and   later\n\nproceedings were so flawed as to entitle him to the relief of\n\ncancellation of deportation. On his petition for review, we uphold\n\nthe order of deportation.\n\n                                          I.\n\n            The following facts appear from the decision of the\n\nImmigration     Judge   or    from   the       record   and   are   supported   by\n\nsubstantial evidence.        In February 1996, based on information from\n\nthe United States Customs Service and from INS Special Agent\n\nJarvis, the INS determined that a man named Jose Teodoro Navarro-\n\nChalan had entered the United States in New Orleans on August 2,\n\n1990 and was presently working in Boston for Dobbs, a catering\n\ncompany    at   Logan   Airport,     in    violation     of   immigration    laws.\n\nAlthough it is not clear from the record how this information was\n\nobtained, Navarro admitted entering the United States as a crewman,\n\nand INS regulations require that crewmen register with the INS in\n\norder to receive landing privileges, which allow them to stay in\n\nthe United States for up 29 days while their ship remains at port.\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f8 C.F.R. § 252.1(c)-(d).     Presumably, the INS had some record of\n\nNavarro's admission as a crewman and suspected from the length of\n\nhis stay and his current job that he had overstayed his landing\n\nprivileges.\n\n             The INS issued a warrant for Navarro's arrest.   The INS\n\narranged for Dobbs to instruct five of its employees to go to the\n\ninternational terminal at Logan Airport, where the INS had an\n\nupstairs facility, on February 20, 1996. Navarro testified that he\n\ncould have chosen not to go, but only at the risk of losing his\n\njob.\n\n             At around 10:20 a.m., the employees arrived at the\n\nterminal and were met by six government agents, including three\n\narmed police officers.      Several employees were questioned and,\n\nafter they produced identification, were allowed to step away from\n\nthe group.    When Navarro was asked for his name and nationality, he\n\nproduced a driver's license and stated that he was from Peru.      At\n\n10:30 a.m., an INS agent filled out a Form I-213 (Record of\n\nDeportable Alien) indicating that Navarro was a Peruvian citizen\n\nwho had entered this country as a crewman on August 2, 1990 and had\n\nbeen authorized to stay for no longer than thirty days.       About 15\n\nminutes later, Navarro was served with the previously prepared\n\narrest warrant.      He was simultaneously served with Form I-286\n\n(Notification to Alien of Conditions of Release or Detention),\n\nwhich informed him in English and Spanish that he was being\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\freleased on his own recognizance, that he had the right to legal\n\nrepresentation, that free representation was available, and that a\n\nhearing would be held before an immigration judge.           Navarro signed\n\nthe form, acknowledging its receipt.\n\n            Navarro testified that he was then taken upstairs to an\n\ninterrogation room at around 11:00 a.m., where he answered several\n\nagents' questions about when and how he had entered the country.\n\nHe testified that one agent told him that he would be deported from\n\nthe United States that very day.           At some point before Navarro was\n\nreleased, he was served with a copy of an Order to Show Cause,\n\nwhich notified him in Spanish and English that any statements he\n\nmade to an INS officer could be used against him and which\n\nreiterated that Navarro had the right to representation, that free\n\nrepresentation was available, and that he would have a hearing\n\nbefore an immigration judge. Although Navarro later testified that\n\nhe was never informed of his rights orally, the order indicates\n\nthat it was read orally in Spanish to Navarro.           Physical force was\n\nnot used at any time, nor was Navarro deprived of the use of the\n\nbathroom.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            On July 2, 1997, Navarro had a hearing before an IJ.           He\n\ntestified, invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege several times.\n\nHe   also   sought   to   suppress,   on    both   constitutional   and   non-\n\nconstitutional grounds, all evidence arising from his February 20,\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f1996 statements to the INS agents, including Form I-213.                      The IJ\n\nheld an evidentiary hearing on the issue of suppression, in which\n\nNavarro again testified. After the hearing, the IJ made a specific\n\nfinding that Navarro's statements to the INS agents were voluntary,\n\nnoting, inter alia, that \"[r]espondent presented no evidence that\n\nhe was threatened or coerced to answer the questions by the agent.\"\n\nThe IJ also rejected Navarro's Fourth Amendment argument on the\n\nground       that   the   exclusionary    rule    does   not     apply   to    civil\n\ndeportation hearings, at least absent extraordinary circumstances\n\nnot present here.         The IJ did not address certain claims arising\n\nunder INS       regulations.     The     IJ    found   Navarro    deportable     and\n\npermitted voluntary departure.            The BIA affirmed without opinion.\n\n                                       III.\n\n               Petitioning for review from the deportation decision,\n\nNavarro argues that his statements on February 20, 1996 should have\n\nbeen suppressed as the fruit of an unlawful interrogation in\n\nviolation of his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights and that,\n\nwithout this information, there is insufficient evidence to deport\n\nhim.       He also says that the procedures used by the agents violated\n\nINS regulations 8 C.F.R. §§ 287.3 and 242.2(c) (1995).1                   We deal\n\nwith each argument in turn.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          The 1995 version of the regulations applies because the\nalleged violations occurred on February 20, 1996.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f            As    to   Navarro's      first    argument,    we   note   that    the\n\ngovernment    need     only    establish      the   respondent's   identity     and\n\nalienage to meet its burden on deportation.               INS v. Lopez-Mendoza,\n\n468 U.S. 1032, 1039 (1984).                The burden then shifts to the\n\nrespondent to show the time, place, and manner of entry in order to\n\ndefeat deportation.       Id.; see 8 U.S.C. § 1361.         The government has\n\nmet its burden here based on Navarro's pre-arrest statements of his\n\nname and nationality, as recorded on Form I-213, which the IJ\n\nproperly refused to suppress for the reasons described below.2\n\nNavarro, however, has made no effort to carry his burden other than\n\nmoving to suppress.\n\n            Navarro's name is not information even subject to being\n\nsuppressed.       The identity of an alien, or even of a defendant, is\n\n\"never itself suppressible as a fruit of an unlawful arrest, even\n\nif it is conceded that an unlawful arrest, search, or interrogation\n\noccurred.\"       INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1039 (1984).\n\n            The next issue is whether Navarro's pre-arrest statement\n\nof   his   alienage,     and    its   recording      in   Form   I-213,   may    be\n\n\n      2\n          Navarro goes on to complain about statements made later\nthat day, arguing that he was inadequately advised of his rights.\nWe do not reach the question of the suppression of Navarro's later\nstatements, since the government has already met its burden on\ndeportation based on his pre-arrest statements.       We do note,\nhowever, that the record flatly refutes Navarro's assertion to this\ncourt that he was never advised of his rights. Navarro was served\nwith Form I-286, which informed him in Spanish of his right to a\nhearing and to representation, simultaneously with his arrest\nwarrant. Navarro's counsel conceded to the IJ that Navarro can\nread Spanish.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fsuppressed.      Navarro     first   argues   that   his    statement   of   his\n\nalienage should be suppressed because the arrest was in violation\n\nof the Fourth Amendment.       We reject this argument for two reasons.\n\nFirst, Navarro's statement of alienage was made before he was\n\narrested. Navarro was not in custody until the warrant was served.\n\nThe IJ had adequate support for his finding that, before that\n\npoint, Navarro voluntarily chose to be there rather than to risk\n\nlosing his job, and there was no evidence that Navarro asked to\n\nleave, was told that he could not leave, or was restrained from\n\nleaving until the warrant was served.             Second, Navarro has not\n\ndemonstrated that his arrest violated the Fourth Amendment.                  Once\n\nNavarro's identity was confirmed, he was lawfully arrested pursuant\n\nto the warrant.    The arrest was the prelude to a civil immigration\n\nproceeding, and not to a criminal proceeding.\n\n             Navarro, attempting to bring himself within the glimmer\n\nof hope of suppression left open by Lopez-Mendoza, also argues that\n\nhis statement of his alienage should be suppressed as involuntary.\n\nIn Lopez-Mendoza, the Supreme Court concluded that the cost of the\n\nexclusionary rule generally outweighs its benefits in the context\n\nof civil deportation hearings.          Id. at 1050-51.          The Court thus\n\nheld that the exclusionary rule generally should not apply in that\n\ncontext, but may have left the door open in cases of \"egregious\n\nviolations of Fourth Amendment or other liberties that might\n\ntransgress    notions   of    fundamental     fairness     and   undermine   the\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fprobative value of the evidence obtained.\"          Id.    Navarro's list of\n\ncomplaints, however, does not rise to that level of egregiousness.\n\nThe IJ found, with adequate support, that Navarro's statements were\n\nvoluntary.\n\n            Navarro disagrees, insisting that his statement of his\n\nalienage must be found involuntary because of the site of the\n\nquestioning and because he was not given a statement of rights\n\nbefore he revealed his nationality. We reject these arguments. As\n\nto the site of the questioning, nothing requires the INS to perform\n\nan immigration raid on the premises of an employer, particularly\n\nwhen the employer cooperates with the INS to make its suspect\n\nemployees available at another location.                Employers have good\n\nbusiness reasons for such agreements, which avoid disruption of the\n\nworkplace.    As to the statement of rights, the failure to notify a\n\nrespondent of his or her rights does not render an otherwise\n\nvoluntary statement inadmissible in a deportation case.                   See\n\nNavia-Duran v. INS, 568 F.2d 803, 808 (1st Cir. 1977).             Here, the\n\nIJ had adequate evidence to conclude that Navarro's decision to\n\ncooperate    by   giving   his    name   and   nationality   was   voluntary.\n\nNavarro saw others being asked to step back, away from the INS\n\nquestioners,      when     they     cooperated     by     presenting    their\n\nidentification.\n\n             We turn to Navarro's argument that the INS did not follow\n\nits own regulatory procedures.           Again, the record flatly refutes\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fthese claims.   Regulation 287.3, by its own terms, applies only to\n\nwarrantless arrests.   8 C.F.R. § 287.3; see Navia-Duran, 568 F.2d\n\nat 809.   Navarro's arrest occurred pursuant to a warrant.   Navarro\n\nargues, however, that in the 20 to 25 minutes after he got to the\n\nterminal but before the arrest warrant was served, he was being\n\nheld without a warrant and was thus within the scope of § 287.3.\n\nWe reject this argument.     As we have said, Navarro was not in\n\ncustody until the arrest warrant was served.   And even if he was in\n\ncustody during that 20 to 25 minute period, the fact that the\n\nofficers took time to confirm his name and nationality before\n\nserving the warrant does not mean that he was somehow \"arrested\n\nwithout a warrant.\"    Finally, even if § 287.3 were applicable and\n\nwere violated, INS regulations state that § 287.3 and the other\n\nregulations in its subpart \"do not, are not intended to, shall not\n\nbe construed to, and may not be relied upon to create any rights,\n\nsubstantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any\n\nmatter, civil or criminal.\"     8 C.F.R. § 287.11 (1995) (current\n\nversion at 8 C.F.R. § 287.12).3\n\n\n\n     3\n          Navarro argues that § 287.11 does not bar him from\n\"pursu[ing] remedies for regulatory violations where constitutional\nrights are at stake or where the violation affects the overall\nfairness of the proceeding.\" But even if this were so, he has not\nshown that those conditions are present here. As we have said,\nNavarro's statements were voluntary. Cf. Navia-Duran, 568 F.2d at\n810 (reversing a deportation order when an INS officer never\nnotified the respondent of her rights, thus violating 8 C.F.R. §\n287.3, because this failure, combined with other facts, indicated\nthat respondent's statements were coerced).\n\n                                  -9-\n\f          Regulation 242.2(c), which does apply to arrests by\n\nwarrants, was satisfied when Navarro was given Form I-286 and the\n\nOrder to Show Cause, both of which contained statements of his\n\nrights.   Navarro argues that § 242.2(c) requires that the Order to\n\nShow Cause must be explained to the respondent contemporaneously\n\nwith the service of the arrest warrant, and that, here, it was read\n\nto Navarro (in Spanish) five hours late.       Regulation 242.2(c)\n\nstates that \"[w]hen a warrant of arrest is served under this part,\n\nthe respondent shall have explained to him/her the contents of the\n\norder to show cause . . . .\"   The regulation does not specify how\n\nlong an agent can wait after the service of the warrant before\n\nexplaining the Order to Show Cause.   But even if Navarro is correct\n\nthat five hours is too long, he concedes that his statements could\n\nbe suppressed only if he could show prejudice from the violation of\n\nthe regulation.   No such prejudice has been shown here.        The\n\nstatements upon which Navarro's deportation was based were made\n\nbefore the arrest warrant was served, so even if the Order to Show\n\nCause had been read simultaneously with the service of the warrant,\n\nit would not have affected the evidence supporting Navarro's\n\ndeportability.\n\n          In sum, the arguments presented in this petition for\n\nreview are without merit.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f                                  IV.\n\n          We   affirm   the   order   of   deportation,   including   the\n\nprivilege of voluntary departure from this country.        So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f",

He was ordered deported in August 1998, and the BIA affirmed that order in March 2003. Navarro has never argued that he should be allowed to stay in the United States because he is legally here; he argues only that the INS arrest and later proceedings were so flawed as to entitle him to the relief of cancellation of deportation. On his petition for review, we uphold the order of deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts appear from the decision of the Immigration Judge or from the record and are supported by substantial evidence. In February 1996, based on information from the United States Customs Service and from INS Special Agent Jarvis, the INS determined that a man named Jose Teodoro Navarro-Chalan had entered the United States in New Orleans on August 2, 1990 and was presently working in Boston for Dobbs, a catering company at Logan Airport, in violation of immigration laws. Although it is not clear from the record how this information was obtained, Navarro admitted entering the United States as a crewman, and INS regulations require that crewmen register with the INS in order to receive landing privileges, which allow them to stay in the United States for up 29 days while their ship remains at port. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 252.1(c)-(d). Presumably, the INS had some record of Navarro's admission as a crewman and suspected from the length of his stay and his current job that he had overstayed his landing privileges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INS issued a warrant for Navarro's arrest. The INS arranged for Dobbs to instruct five of its employees to go to the international terminal at Logan Airport, where the INS had an upstairs facility, on February 20, 1996. Navarro testified that he could have chosen not to go, but only at the risk of losing his job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At around 10:20 a.m., the employees arrived at the terminal and were met by six government agents, including three armed police officers. Several employees were questioned and, after they produced identification, were allowed to step away from the group. When Navarro was asked for his name and nationality, he produced a driver's license and stated that he was from Peru. At 10:30 a.m., an INS agent filled out a Form I-213 (Record of Deportable Alien) indicating that Navarro was a Peruvian citizen who had entered this country as a crewman on August 2, 1990 and had been authorized to stay for no longer than thirty days. About 15 minutes later, Navarro was served with the previously prepared arrest warrant. He was simultaneously served with Form I-286 (Notification to Alien of Conditions of Release or Detention), which informed him in English and Spanish that he was being released on his own recognizance, that he had the right to legal representation, that free representation was available, and that a hearing would be held before an immigration judge.

At some point before Navarro was released, he was served with a copy of an Order to Show Cause, which notified him in Spanish and English that any statements he made to an INS officer could be used against him and which reiterated that Navarro had the right to representation, that free representation was available, and that he would have a hearing before an immigration judge. Although Navarro later testified that he was never informed of his rights orally, the order indicates that it was read orally in Spanish to Navarro.

He testified, invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege several times. He also sought to suppress, on both constitutional and non-constitutional grounds, all evidence arising from his February 20, 1996 statements to the INS agents, including Form I-213. The IJ held an evidentiary hearing on the issue of suppression, in which Navarro again testified. After the hearing, the IJ made a specific finding that Navarro's statements to the INS agents were voluntary, noting, inter alia, that \"[r]espondent presented no evidence that he was threatened or coerced to answer the questions by the agent.\" The IJ also rejected Navarro's Fourth Amendment argument on the ground that the exclusionary rule does not apply to civil deportation hearings, at least absent extraordinary circumstances not present here. The IJ did not address certain claims arising under INS regulations. The IJ found Navarro deportable and permitted voluntary departure.

He also says that the procedures used by the agents violated INS regulations 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 287.3 and 242.2(c) (1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> We deal with each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Navarro's first argument, we note that the government need only establish the respondent's identity and alienage to meet its burden on deportation. <i>INS v. Lopez-Mendoza,</i> 468 U.S. 1032, 1039, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984). The burden then shifts to the respondent to show the time, place, and manner of entry in order to defeat deportation. <i>Id.; see</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1361. The government has met its burden here based on Navarro's pre-arrest statements of his name and nationality, as recorded on Form I-213, which the IJ properly refused to suppress for the reasons described below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Navarro, however, has made no effort to carry his burden other than moving to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Navarro's name is not information even subject to being suppressed. The identity of an alien, or even of a defendant, is \"never itself suppressible as a fruit of an unlawful arrest, even if it is conceded that an unlawful arrest, search, or interrogation occurred.\" <i>INS v. Lopez-Mendoza,</i> 468 U.S. 1032, 1039, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next issue is whether Navarro's pre-arrest statement of his alienage, and its recording in Form I-213, may be suppressed. Navarro first argues that his statement of his alienage should be suppressed because the arrest was in violation of the Fourth Amendment. We reject this argument for two reasons. First, Navarro's statement of alienage was made before he was arrested. Navarro was not in custody until the warrant was served. The IJ had adequate support for his finding that, before that point, Navarro voluntarily chose to be there rather than to risk losing his job, and there was no evidence that Navarro asked to leave, was told that he could not leave, or was restrained from leaving until the warrant was served. Second, Navarro has not demonstrated that his arrest violated the Fourth Amendment. Once Navarro's identity was confirmed, he was lawfully arrested pursuant to the warrant. The arrest was the prelude to a civil immigration proceeding, and not to a criminal proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Navarro, attempting to bring himself within the glimmer of hope of suppression left open by <i>Lopez-Mendoza,</i> also argues that his statement of his alienage should be suppressed as involuntary. In <i>Lopez-Mendoza,</i> the Supreme Court concluded that the cost of the exclusionary rule generally outweighs its benefits in the context of civil deportation hearings. <i>Id.</i> at 1050-51, 104 S.Ct. 3479. The Court thus held that the exclusionary rule generally should not apply in that context, but may have left the door open in cases of \"egregious violations of Fourth Amendment or other liberties that might transgress notions of fundamental fairness and undermine the probative value of the evidence obtained.\" <i>Id.</i> Navarro's list of complaints, however, does not rise to that level of egregiousness. The IJ found, with adequate support, that Navarro's statements were voluntary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Navarro disagrees, insisting that his statement of his alienage must be found involuntary because of the site of the questioning and because he was not given a statement of rights before he revealed his nationality. We reject these arguments. As to the site of the questioning, nothing requires the INS to perform an immigration raid on the premises of an employer, particularly when the employer cooperates with the INS to make its suspect employees available at another location. Employers have good business reasons for such agreements, which avoid disruption of the workplace. As to the statement of rights, the failure to notify a respondent of his or her rights does not render an otherwise voluntary statement inadmissible in a deportation case. <i>See Navia Duran v. INS,</i> 568 F.2d 803, 808 (1st Cir.1977). Here, the IJ had adequate evidence to conclude that Navarro's decision to cooperate by giving his name and nationality was voluntary. Navarro saw others being asked to step back, away from the INS questioners, when they cooperated by presenting their identification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to Navarro's argument that the INS did not follow its own regulatory procedures. Again, the record flatly refutes these claims. Regulation 287.3, by its own terms, applies only to warrantless arrests. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 287.3; <i>see Navia-Duran,</i> 568 F.2d at 809. Navarro's arrest occurred pursuant to a warrant. Navarro argues, however, that in the 20 to 25 minutes after he got to the terminal but before the arrest warrant was served, he was being held without a warrant and was thus within the scope of &#167; 287.3. We reject this argument. As we have said, Navarro was not in custody until the arrest warrant was served. And even if he was in custody during that 20 to 25 minute period, the fact that the officers took time to confirm his name and nationality before serving the warrant does not mean that he was somehow \"arrested without a warrant.\" Finally, even if &#167; 287.3 were applicable and were violated, INS regulations state that &#167; 287.3 and the other regulations in its subpart \"do not, are not intended to, shall not be construed to, and may not be relied upon to create any rights, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any matter, civil or criminal.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 287.11 (1995) (current version at 8 C.F.R. &#167; 287.12).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regulation 242.2(c), which does apply to arrests by warrants, was satisfied when Navarro was given Form I-286 and the Order to Show Cause, both of which contained statements of his rights. Navarro argues that &#167; 242.2(c) requires that the Order to Show Cause must be explained to the respondent contemporaneously with the service of the arrest warrant, and that, here, it was read to Navarro (in Spanish) five hours late. Regulation 242.2(c) states that \"[w]hen a warrant of arrest is served under this part, the respondent shall have explained to him/her the contents of the order to show cause....\" The regulation does not specify how long an agent can wait after the service of the warrant before explaining the Order to Show Cause. But even if Navarro is correct that five hours is too long, he concedes that his statements could be suppressed only if he could show prejudice from the violation of the regulation. No such prejudice has been shown here. The statements upon which Navarro's deportation was based were made before the arrest warrant was served, so even if the Order to Show Cause had been read simultaneously with the service of the warrant, it would not have affected the evidence supporting Navarro's deportability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the arguments presented in this petition for review are without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>affirm</i> the order of deportation, including the privilege of voluntary departure from this country.

He was ordered deported in August 1998, and the BIA affirmed that order in March 2003. Navarro has never argued that he should be allowed to stay in the United States because he is legally here; he argues only that the INS arrest and later proceedings were so flawed as to entitle him to the relief of cancellation of deportation. On his petition for review, we uphold the order of deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts appear from the decision of the Immigration Judge or from the record and are supported by substantial evidence. In February 1996, based on information from the United States Customs Service and from INS Special Agent Jarvis, the INS determined that a man named Jose Teodoro Navarro-Chalan had entered the United States in New Orleans on August 2, 1990 and was presently working in Boston for Dobbs, a catering company at Logan Airport, in violation of immigration laws. Although it is not clear from the record how this information was obtained, Navarro admitted entering the United States as a crewman, and INS regulations require that crewmen register with the INS in order to receive landing privileges, which allow them to stay in the United States for up 29 days while their ship remains at port. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 252.1(c)-(d). Presumably, the INS had some record of Navarro's admission as a crewman and suspected from the length of his stay and his current job that he had overstayed his landing privileges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INS issued a warrant for Navarro's arrest. The INS arranged for Dobbs to instruct five of its employees to go to the international terminal at Logan Airport, where the INS had an upstairs facility, on February 20, 1996. Navarro testified that he could have chosen not to go, but only at the risk of losing his job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At around 10:20 a.m., the employees arrived at the terminal and were met by six government agents, including three armed police officers. Several employees were questioned and, after they produced identification, were allowed to step away from the group. When Navarro was asked for his name and nationality, he produced a driver's license and stated that he was from Peru. At 10:30 a.m., an INS agent filled out a Form I-213 (Record of Deportable Alien) indicating that Navarro was a Peruvian citizen who had entered this country as a crewman on August 2, 1990 and had been authorized to stay for no longer than thirty days. About 15 minutes later, Navarro was served with the previously prepared arrest warrant. He was simultaneously served with Form I-286 (Notification to Alien of Conditions of Release or Detention), which informed him in English and Spanish that he was being released on his own recognizance, that he had the right to legal representation, that free representation was available, and that a hearing would be held before an immigration judge. Navarro signed the form, acknowledging its receipt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Navarro testified that he was then taken upstairs to an interrogation room at around 11:00 a.m., where he answered several agents' questions about when and how he had entered the country. He testified that one agent told him that he would be deported from the United States that very day. At some point before Navarro was released, he was served with a copy of an Order to Show Cause, which notified him in Spanish and English that any statements he made to an INS officer could be used against him and which reiterated that Navarro had the right to representation, that free representation was available, and that he would have a hearing before an immigration judge. Although Navarro later testified that he was never informed of his rights orally, the order indicates that it was read orally in Spanish to Navarro. Physical force was not used at any time, nor was Navarro deprived of the use of the bathroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 2, 1997, Navarro had a hearing before an IJ. He testified, invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege several times. He also sought to suppress, on both constitutional and non-constitutional grounds, all evidence arising from his February 20, 1996 statements to the INS agents, including Form I-213. The IJ held an evidentiary hearing on the issue of suppression, in which Navarro again testified. After the hearing, the IJ made a specific finding that Navarro's statements to the INS agents were voluntary, noting, inter alia, that \"[r]espondent presented no evidence that he was threatened or coerced to answer the questions by the agent.\" The IJ also rejected Navarro's Fourth Amendment argument on the ground that the exclusionary rule does not apply to civil deportation hearings, at least absent extraordinary circumstances not present here. The IJ did not address certain claims arising under INS regulations. The IJ found Navarro deportable and permitted voluntary departure.

We do not reach the question of the suppression of Navarro's later statements, since the government has already met its burden on deportation based on his pre-arrest statements. We do note, however, that the record flatly refutes Navarro's assertion to this court that he was never advised of his rights. Navarro was served with Form I-286, which informed him in Spanish of his right to a hearing and to representation, simultaneously with his arrest warrant.
