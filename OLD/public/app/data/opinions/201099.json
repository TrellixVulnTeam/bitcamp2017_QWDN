Plaintiff-appellant\n\nSupermercados       Econo    (\"Econo\")       appeals       the     district    court's\n\ndismissal of its flood insurance money recovery claim against\n\ndefendant-appellee Integrand Assurance Co. (\"Integrand\").                            The\n\ndistrict    court    found    that    Econo       failed      to   comply     with   the\n\nrequirement of the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (\"SFIP\") that a\n\nsworn proof of loss be submitted within sixty days after a flood\n\nloss.    Econo does not contest this holding but argues instead that\n\nthe case should be remanded to the district court for consideration\n\nof Econo's claim as a loss payee.                 As the findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law in the district court's order and opinion do not\n\npermit meaningful appellate review, we vacate the judgment and\n\nremand to the district court with directions to address Econo's\n\nloss payee claim in compliance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n52(a).\n\n                                I.    Background\n\n            We briefly summarize the relevant facts as found by the\n\ndistrict court. In August 1994, Integrand issued a flood insurance\n\npolicy to Atlantic Cold Storage, Inc. (\"Atlantic\") under the\n\nNational Flood Insurance Program (\"NFIP\"), covering the risk of\n\nloss of     property   and    perishable         items   stored     in   the   Bechara\n\nIndustrial Park.        In September 1994, Atlantic entered into an\n\nagreement    with    Econo   for     the    storage      of   Econo's    goods.       On\n\nSeptember 23, 1994, in response to a request from Atlantic's\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\finsurance broker, Integrand issued an endorsement to Atlantic's\n\npolicy including Econo as an additional insured and loss payee.\n\n           On September 10, 1996, Hurricane Hortense's rains flooded\n\nthe   Bechara    warehouse,   damaging      all   stored     merchandise.     On\n\nNovember   14,    1996,    Econo   sent     Integrand   a    letter   informing\n\nIntegrand that Econo suffered the loss of all goods stored at\n\nAtlantic's      facilities,   estimating       the   inventory's      value   at\n\n$131,423.54.      On November 19, Atlantic filed a signed and sworn\n\nproof of loss with Integrand, which did not include the loss\n\nsuffered by Econo.     On December 12, 1996, Integrand issued a check\n\npayable to Atlantic in the amount of $250,144.               The check did not\n\ninclude Econo as a payee, and Atlantic did not disburse any payment\n\nto Econo from these funds.\n\n             On December 4, 1997, Econo filed a complaint seeking\n\ncompensation for insured property losses and monetary damages\n\nagainst Integrand,        Atlantic,   Atlantic's     owner,     president,    and\n\nprincipal shareholder, Ernesto Cabezas (\"Cabezas\"), and Atlantic's\n\ninsurance agent, Colonial Insurance Agency, Inc. (\"Colonial\"),\n\npursuant to the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (\"NFIA\"), 42\n\nU.S.C. § 4001 et seq., and Puerto Rico law.                 Econo and Colonial\n\nsettled their claims and partial judgment was entered on July 12,\n\n2000, dismissing the action against Colonial.               After a bench trial\n\non June 24, 2002, the district court ordered the parties to submit\n\nproposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f           On    February    28,   2003,      the   district   court   dismissed\n\nEcono's claims against Integrand for failure to comply with the\n\nSFIP's requirement that a sworn proof of loss be submitted within\n\nsixty   days    of   a   flood   loss   and    because   Econo's   merchandise\n\nconstituted bailee goods excluded from the SFIP's coverage. On the\n\nbasis of default judgments entered against Atlantic and Cabezas,\n\nthe district court granted Econo's negligence claims for failure to\n\nsafeguard Econo's goods and found Atlantic and Cabezas jointly\n\nliable for the value of the damaged merchandise, $131,423.54. This\n\nappeal followed, in which Econo contends that the district court\n\nerred by failing to make findings of fact and conclusions of law,\n\nas required by Rule 52(a), regarding Econo's claim that, as a loss\n\npayee under the flood policy, Econo should have been included as a\n\npayee in the payment of any claim to Atlantic by Integrand.1\n\n                                 II.    Analysis\n\n           Rule 52(a) provides that \"[i]n all actions tried upon the\n\nfacts without a jury . . ., the court shall find the facts\n\nspecially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon.\"\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).             \"The requirements of Rule 52(a) are\n\nintended to assure that the district court gives appropriate\n\n\n\n1\n  A loss payee is a \"person or entity named in an insurance policy\n. . . to be paid if the insured property suffers a loss.\" Black's\nLaw Dictionary 958 (7th ed. 1999). Econo thus argues that when\nIntegrand accepted and paid Atlantic's claim, Econo should have\nbeen included as a loss payee, regardless of the failure of its\nclaim as an additional insured.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fconsideration to all essential relevant factors and provides an\n\nadequate basis for meaningful appellate review of its decision.\"\n\nTEC Eng'g Corp. v. Budget Molders Supply, Inc., 82 F.3d 542, 545\n\n(1st Cir. 1996)(citing 9A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure, § 2571, at 478-80 (2d ed. 1994)).               We have previously\n\nnoted   that   while   \"it   is   of   vital   importance       that    the   court\n\nscrupulously follow the requirements of Rule 52(a), . . . [t]he\n\nburden is not a heavy one.             'The judge need only make brief,\n\ndefinite, pertinent findings and conclusions upon the contested\n\nmatters.'\"     In re Rare Coin Galleries of Am., Inc., 862 F.2d 896,\n\n900   (1st   Cir.   1988)(quoting      Fed.    R.   Civ.   P.   52(a)    Advisory\n\nCommittee Note (1946 Amendment)). We may even overlook the absence\n\nof Rule 52(a) findings and conclusions \"if our own review of the\n\nrecord substantially eliminates all reasonable doubt as to the\n\nbasis of the district court's decision.\"            TEC Eng'g Corp., 82 F.3d\n\nat 545 (citations omitted).        Nonetheless, when \"the absence of any\n\nsubsidiary findings of fact or conclusions of law renders it\n\nvirtually impossible for this court to do anything but speculate as\n\nto the basis of the district court's ruling,\" we are unable to\n\nengage in meaningful appellate review and must remand to the\n\ndistrict court.     Id. (citations omitted).\n\n             The district court made no conclusions of law regarding\n\nEcono's claim as a loss payee.         The district court did indeed find\n\nthat Econo's claim as an additional insured must fail because Econo\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\ffailed to comply with the SFIP requirement of a signed and sworn\n\nproof of loss within sixty days and because the merchandise stored\n\nby   Econo   constituted      bailee   goods      excluded    from     the    SFIP's\n\ncoverage.      Econo does not dispute these determinations but argues\n\nthat the SFIP's exclusion of bailee goods has no bearing on its\n\nclaim as a loss payee, because a loss payee is merely a party\n\ndesignated to be included in the payment of the successful claim of\n\nthe named insured, in this case Atlantic.                  The district court\n\nopinion does not indicate on what basis, legal or factual, Econo's\n\nloss   payee    claim   was   rejected;      it   simply     ignores    the    issue\n\naltogether.\n\n             Integrand directs our attention to precedent suggesting\n\nthat \"appellate tribunals should not stand unduly on ceremony, but\n\nshould fill in the blanks in the district court's account when the\n\nrecord and the circumstances permit this to be done without short-\n\nchanging the parties.\"        Vecinos de Barrio Uno v. City of Holyoke,\n\n72 F.3d 973, 989 (1st Cir. 1995)(citing Applewood Landscape &\n\nNursery Co. v. Hollingsworth, 884 F.2d 1502, 1503-04 (1st Cir.\n\n1989)). Even when specific findings are lacking, Integrand reminds\n\nus, appellate review is not necessarily precluded, and we may\n\nproceed \"view[ing] the record in the light most favorable to the\n\nruling [and] making all reasonably supported inferences.\"                     Arthur\n\nD. Little, Inc. v. Dooyang Corp., 147 F.3d 47, 49 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f1998)(quoting Roche v. Royal Bank of Canada, 109 F.3d 820, 821 (1st\n\nCir. 1997)).\n\n          To review the district court opinion as to the loss payee\n\nclaim, however, even in the light most favorable to the implicit\n\nrejection of the loss payee claim, would require us to infer the\n\nconclusions    of   law   as   well   as    the   factual   basis   of   those\n\nconclusions. \"As we have stressed repeatedly in the past, the Rule\n\n52(a) requirements that facts be stated specially, and conclusions\n\nof law separately, impose on the trial court an obligation to\n\nensure that its ratio decidendi is set forth with enough clarity to\n\nenable a reviewing court reliably to perform its function; namely,\n\nto review the conclusions of law de novo and the essential findings\n\nof fact for clear error.\"       Touch v. Master Unit Die Prods., Inc.,\n\n43 F.3d 754, 759 (1st Cir. 1995)(collecting cases).            The district\n\ncourt's opinion does not afford us this opportunity. We must again\n\n\"emphasize that appellate review is utterly impracticable when\n\nneither the conclusions of law which guided the district court\n\nruling, nor the findings of fact essential to a principled decision\n\nunder the applicable law, are discernible from its decision.\"             Id.\n\n          Integrand argues that the loss payee claim was not a\n\ncontested matter before the district court and thus did not require\n\nRule 52(a) findings and conclusions.          To support this contention,\n\nIntegrand argues that Econo's \"mention\" of the loss payee status\n\ndoes not establish a controversy between the parties. As Integrand\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fconcedes,   however,        Econo      listed       in    the    Ultimate       Facts    to    be\n\nDisputed    section        of    the    Pretrial         Order    \"[t]he    validity          and\n\nenforceability        of        the    additional         insured     and       loss     payee\n\nendorsements, in full force and effect from 1994 to 1996 inclusive,\n\nissued to Econo and if it afforded coverage to Econo's property\n\n. . . under its contents coverage section.\"                       Additionally, Econo's\n\nstatus as an additional insured and loss payee was discussed\n\nrepeatedly at trial.             Econo's counsel elicited specific testimony\n\non the loss payee claim from the manager of Integrand's Flood\n\nInsurance Department, Freddie Acevedo-Toledo, in the following\n\nmanner:\n\n            Q.        Isn't it true, Mr. Acevedo, that as a loss\n                      payee under a policy such as the one in\n                      this case, any payments made for a claim\n                      under that policy have to include as a\n                      payee Econo Supermarkets, Inc.?\n            A:        Correct.\n\nThus, we find that Econo's loss payee claim was a contested matter\n\ntriggering the district court's duties under Rule 52(a).\n\n            Integrand           also   puts    forth       a     series    of    substantive\n\narguments regarding the validity of Econo's loss payee claim.\n\nIntegrand argues, inter alia, that the claim is barred because\n\nEcono did not comply with all the requirements of the SFIP and\n\nthat the policy in its entirety was null and void due to alleged\n\nmisrepresentation by Atlantic regarding the warehouse's ownership.\n\nThe   merits     of   these       assertions        and    their     relevance          to    the\n\n\n\n                                              -8-\n\fdisposition of Econo's loss payee claim are properly left to the\n\ndistrict court on remand.\n\n            Integrand's final argument is that Econo's failure to\n\nfile a Rule 52(b) motion in the district court precludes Econo from\n\nchallenging the district court's compliance with Rule 52(a) on\n\nappeal.     Rule 52(b) provides that \"[o]n a party's motion filed no\n\nlater than 10 days after entry of judgment, the court may amend its\n\nfindings -- or make additional findings -- and may amend the\n\njudgment accordingly.\"      Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(b).         While \"[a]ppeals\n\nbased on the insufficiency of the findings should not be overused\n\nas substitutes for motions to amend findings,\" 9A Wright & Miller,\n\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 2582 (2d ed. Supp. 2003), failure\n\nto file such a motion in the district court does not preclude\n\nappeal.     See, e.g., Touch, 43 F.3d at 759 (noting that \"neither\n\nparty sought reconsideration under Rule 52(a)\").           Nevertheless, we\n\nemphasize     again,   as   we    have    before,   that      \"although   all\n\nresponsibility under Rule 52(a) rests with the trial judge, . . .\n\ncounsel might have avoided the unnecessary expense and delay\n\noccasioned in this case simply by submitting a timely request for\n\nreconsideration based on the need for adequate findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law as required by Rule 52(a).\"          Id.\n\n            In   vacating   and   remanding   for   further    findings   and\n\nconclusions in compliance with Rule 52(a), we do not disturb our\n\nprecedent indicating that \"the district court was not required to\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fmake findings on every detail, was not required to discuss all of\n\nthe evidence that supports each of the findings made, and was not\n\nrequired to respond individually to each evidentiary or factual\n\ncontention made by the losing side.\"                Addamax Corp. v. Open\n\nSoftware   Foundation,     Inc.,    152   F.3d    48,   55   (1st   Cir.   1998)\n\n(citations omitted).       \"As long as the trial court clearly relates\n\nthe findings of fact upon which its decision rests and articulates\n\nin a readily intelligible manner the conclusions that it draws by\n\napplying the controlling law to the facts as found, no more is\n\nexigible.\"    Sierra Fría Corp. v. Donald J. Evans, P.C., 127 F.3d\n\n175, 180 (1st Cir. 1997)(citing Peckham v. Continental Cas. Ins.\n\nCo., 895 F.2d 830, 842 (1st Cir. 1990)).                While \"[t]here is no\n\nmechanical    rule   for   determining      the   exact   level     of   findings\n\nrequired by Rule 52(a),\" Addamax Corp., 152 F.3d 4 at 55, we find\n\nthat the district court's failure to provide any indication of the\n\nlegal or factual basis of its disposition of Econo's loss payee\n\nclaim precludes meaningful appellate review.\n\n                             III.    Conclusion\n\n           We vacate the judgment and remand to the district court\n\nfor further findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by\n\nRule 52(a).    In doing so, we do not express any opinion as to the\n\nmerits and the district court may alter or maintain the ultimate\n\nresolution of the case.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f           The judgment of the district court is vacated and the\n\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                              -11-\n\f",

On the basis of default judgments entered against Atlantic and Cabezas, the district court granted Econo's negligence claims for failure to safeguard Econo's goods and found Atlantic and Cabezas jointly liable for the value of the damaged merchandise, $131,423.54. This appeal followed, in which Econo contends that the district court erred by failing to make findings of fact and conclusions of law, as required by Rule 52(a), regarding Econo's claim that, as a loss payee under the flood policy, Econo should have been included as a payee in the payment of any claim to Atlantic by Integrand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 52(a) provides that \"[i]n all actions tried upon the facts without a jury ..., the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). \"The requirements of Rule 52(a) are intended to assure that the district court gives appropriate consideration to all essential relevant factors and provides an adequate basis for meaningful appellate review of its decision.\" <i>TEC Eng'g Corp. v.

Integrand argues, <i>inter alia,</i> that the claim is barred because Econo did not comply with all the requirements of the SFIP and that the policy in its entirety was null and void due to alleged misrepresentation by Atlantic regarding the warehouse's ownership.

Nevertheless, we emphasize again, as we have before, that \"although all responsibility under Rule 52(a) rests with the trial judge, ... counsel might have avoided the unnecessary expense and delay occasioned in this case simply by submitting a timely request for reconsideration based on the need for adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by Rule 52(a).\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In vacating and remanding for further findings and conclusions in compliance with Rule 52(a), we do not disturb our precedent indicating that \"the district court was not required to make findings on every detail, was not required to discuss all of the evidence that supports each of the findings made, and was not required to respond individually to each evidentiary or factual contention made by the losing side.\" <i>Addamax Corp. v.

In August 1994, Integrand issued a flood insurance policy to Atlantic Cold Storage, Inc. (\"Atlantic\") under the National Flood Insurance Program (\"NFIP\"), covering the risk of loss of property and perishable items stored in the Bechara Industrial Park. In September 1994, Atlantic entered into an agreement with Econo for the storage of Econo's goods. On September 23, 1994, in response to a request from Atlantic's insurance broker, Integrand issued an endorsement to Atlantic's policy including Econo as an additional insured and loss payee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 10, 1996, Hurricane Hortense's rains flooded the Bechara warehouse, damaging all stored merchandise. On November 14, 1996, Econo sent Integrand a letter informing Integrand that Econo suffered the loss of all goods stored at Atlantic's facilities, estimating the inventory's value at $131,423.54. On November 19, Atlantic filed a signed and sworn proof of loss with Integrand, which did not include the loss suffered by Econo. On December 12, 1996, Integrand issued a check payable to Atlantic in the amount of $250,144. The check did not include Econo as a payee, and Atlantic did not disburse any payment to Econo from these funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 4, 1997, Econo filed a complaint seeking compensation for insured property losses and monetary damages against Integrand, Atlantic, Atlantic's owner, president, and principal shareholder, Ernesto Cabezas (\"Cabezas\"), and Atlantic's insurance agent, Colonial Insurance Agency, Inc. (\"Colonial\"), pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (\"NFIA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 4001 <i>et seq.,</i> and Puerto Rico law. Econo and Colonial settled their claims and partial judgment was entered on July 12, 2000, dismissing the action against Colonial.

On the basis of default judgments entered against Atlantic and Cabezas, the district court granted Econo's negligence claims for failure to safeguard Econo's goods and found Atlantic and Cabezas jointly liable for the value of the damaged merchandise, $131,423.54.

Supp.2003), failure to file such a motion in the district court does not preclude appeal. <i>See, e.g., Touch,</i> 43 F.3d at 759 (noting that \"neither party sought reconsideration under Rule 52(a)\"). Nevertheless, we emphasize again, as we have before, that \"although all responsibility under Rule 52(a) rests with the trial judge, ... counsel might have avoided the unnecessary expense and delay occasioned in this case simply by submitting a timely request for reconsideration based on the need for adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by Rule 52(a).\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In vacating and remanding for further findings and conclusions in compliance with Rule 52(a), we do not disturb our precedent indicating that \"the district court was not required to make findings on every detail, was not required to discuss all of the evidence that supports each of the findings made, and was not required to respond individually to each evidentiary or factual contention made by the losing side.\" <i>Addamax Corp. v.

While \"[t]here is no mechanical rule for determining the exact level of findings required by Rule 52(a),\" <i>Addamax Corp.,</i> 152 F.3d at 55, we find that the district court's failure to provide any indication of the legal or factual basis of its disposition of Econo's loss payee claim precludes meaningful appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We vacate the judgment and remand to the district court for further findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by Rule 52(a).
