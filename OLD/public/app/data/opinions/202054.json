This case requires us to analyze\n\nthe statutory provision (8 U.S.C. § 1326(d)) that defines the\n\ncircumstances       under   which      a    defendant      charged   with    illegally\n\nreentering the United States after deportation may collaterally\n\nattack   the   validity      of   the       removal     order.1      The    defendant,\n\nDagoberto Luna, appeals from the district court's denial of his\n\nmotion to dismiss his indictment for illegal reentry. The district\n\ncourt held that the defendant did not meet the requirements of\n\n§ 1326(d).     We affirm.\n\n                                             I.\n\nA.   Luna's Background and Deportation Proceedings\n\n           Luna, a citizen of the Dominican Republic, entered the\n\nUnited States as a 5-day-old lawful permanent resident in 1973.\n\nHis immediate family members, including his mother, father, and\n\nsiblings, all live in the United States.                    Luna spent most of his\n\nchildhood in Rhode Island, where he attended school until the 9th\n\ngrade.   Since that time, he has lived in New York and Rhode Island.\n\n           On April 9, 1993, at age 20, Luna was ordered deported\n\nafter he was convicted in state court of third degree grand\n\nlarceny.       He    returned     to       the    United   States    at    some   point\n\nthereafter.     On January 22, 1996, Luna pled guilty in state court\n\nto second degree assault.           He was sentenced to three to six years\n\n\n\n1\n We use the terms \"removal\" and \"deportation\" interchangeably in\nthis opinion.\n\n                                            -2-\n\fimprisonment.   While he was serving his sentence, the Immigration\n\nand Naturalization Service (\"INS\") issued an Order to Show Cause\n\ncharging that Luna was deportable on several grounds, including his\n\nassault conviction and his previous deportation order and reentry.\n\nGiven \"serious problems\" regarding the validity of the previous\n\ndeportation order,2 the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") found that Luna\n\nwas deportable on the sole ground of being an alien convicted of an\n\naggravated felony, see Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\")\n\n§ 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (formerly    INA\n\n§ 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. § 1251 (redesignated 1996)), based on\n\nhis second degree assault conviction.\n\n          During his hearing before the IJ, Luna applied for\n\ndiscretionary relief, requesting a waiver of deportation under\n\nformer INA § 212(c).   8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (repealed 1996).3   The IJ\n\n\n2\n The IJ in Luna's second deportation hearing noted that both Luna\nand the INS agreed that there were \"serious problems with the\nrespondent's original deportation hearing,\" because \"the respondent\nwas deported as having been convicted of two crimes involving moral\nturpitude . . . which was not shown in the respondent's case.\"\nSpecifically, the IJ noted that \"one of the underlying crimes,\nburglary in the third degree, is not necessarily a crime involving\nmoral turpitude, unless it can be shown what specific crime the\nburglary was meant to commit\" and that the INS had failed to\nestablish its case. In addition, the IJ noted that \"as a matter of\nequity, [Luna] testified that he did not appear in court because\nhis child died immediately before the immigration hearing . . . and\ntherefore his attendance there was impossible.\"\n3\n Former § 212(c) provided that \"[a]liens lawfully admitted for\npermanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily\nand not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a\nlawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be\nadmitted in the discretion of the Attorney General . . . . [T]his\n\n                                -3-\n\fdid not consider the merits of Luna's application for relief,\n\nstating in his oral decision that \"the respondent is statutorily\n\nbarred from this and any other forms of relief from deportation\"\n\nunder the Attorney General's decision in In re Soriano, 21 I. & N.\n\nDec. 516 (BIA 1996, A.G. 1997).4\n\n          In Soriano, the Attorney General determined that recent\n\nstatutory amendments to the INA prevented all individuals with\n\n\"aggravated   felony\"   convictions    in   removal   proceedings   from\n\nobtaining discretionary relief from deportation.        See id. at 533-\n\n40; see also Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n\n(\"AEDPA\"), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996) (codified in\n\nvarious   titles);   Illegal   Immigration     Reform   and   Immigrant\n\nResponsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\"), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110\n\nStat. 3009 (1996) (codified in various titles).5         Although Luna\n\n\nsubsection shall not apply to an alien who has been convicted of\none or more aggravated felonies and has served for such felony or\nfelonies a term of imprisonment of at least 5 years.\" 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1182(c)(repealed 1996). By its terms, the statute appears to\nhave applied only to lawful permanent residents \"returning\" to the\nUnited States and facing exclusion. However, the statute has been\ninterpreted to be applicable to any lawful permanent resident,\nfacing exclusion or deportation, who met its eligibility\nrequirements. See Gomes v. Ashcroft, 311 F.3d 43, 44-45 (1st Cir.\n2002).\n4\n Decisions by the Attorney General in immigration proceedings are\nbinding on the Board of Immigration Appeals and Immigration Judges.\nSee 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(g) (stating that \"decisions of the Attorney\nGeneral . . . shall be binding . . . [and] shall serve as\nprecedents in all proceedings involving the same issue or issues\").\n5\n AEDPA amended INA § 212(c) to preclude relief for immigrants\nfacing deportation due to an \"aggravated felony.\"      IIRIRA\n\n                                 -4-\n\fpled guilty to second degree assault before the relevant provisions\n\nof AEDPA and IIRIRA went into effect, the IJ concluded that, under\n\nSoriano, Luna could not apply for discretionary relief.\n\n          Luna, who was represented by a non-lawyer \"accredited\n\nrepresentative,\"6   appealed   the     IJ   decision   to    the    Board   of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\").     On June 10, 1998, the BIA affirmed,\n\nalso relying on Soriano, telling Luna that he was \"statutorily\n\nineligible for [§ 212(c)] relief.\"              Luna did not appeal the\n\nagency's decision in federal court.         On November 8, 1999, he was\n\ndeported for a second time.\n\nB. St. Cyr and Eligibility for INA § 212(c) Relief\n\n          In   2001,   the   Supreme    Court    corrected    the   Attorney\n\nGeneral's misapplication of law.       See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289\n\n(2001).   The Supreme Court emphasized that \"the class of aliens\n\nwhose continued residence in this country has depended on their\n\neligibility for § 212(c) relief is extremely large,\" and that the\n\nretroactive repeal of such relief \"would surely be contrary to\n\nfamiliar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and\n\nsettled expectations.\" Id. at 295-96, 323 (citations and internal\n\n\ncompletely repealed § 212(c) and created a new form of\ndiscretionary relief, \"cancellation of removal,\" which also was not\navailable for immigrants with \"aggravated felony\" convictions. See\nINA § 240A, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a).\n6\n Under certain conditions, non-lawyers, including \"accredited\nrepresentatives\" of approved non-profit organizations, may\nrepresent individuals in removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. §§\n292.1, 292.2.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fquotation marks omitted).          The Court concluded that the repeal of\n\n§ 212(c) relief did not apply retroactively to individuals who had\n\npled guilty to a criminal charge prior to the effective date of the\n\nrepeal.      Id. at 326.\n\n              After St. Cyr was decided, the government changed its\n\nposition on the availability of § 212(c) relief for individuals who\n\npled guilty or nolo contendere to crimes before the effective date\n\nof   AEDPA    and    IRRIRA.       In   2004,     the   government   implemented\n\nprocedures for immigrants to reopen their removal cases in light of\n\nSt. Cyr.     See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44.        However, the procedures were not\n\navailable for immigrants who had already \"departed\" the country.\n\nSee 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(k).\n\nC.   Luna's Indictment for Reentry and the District Court Decision\n\n              At    some   point   after    his    second   deportation,    Luna\n\nreentered the United States.               On November 21, 2003, Luna was\n\nindicted for illegally reentering the United States without the\n\nexpress permission of the Attorney General, in violation of 8\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1326(a) and (b)(2).            He filed a motion to dismiss the\n\nindictment, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1326(d),7 arguing that his\n\n\n\n\n7\n Under the statute, a defendant may challenge the validity of a\ndeportation order that serves as the basis for an indictment for\nillegal reentry.   See infra, Part III(A) (describing 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1326(d)).\n\n                                        -6-\n\fdeportation was fundamentally unfair and thus could not serve as\n\nthe basis for his illegal reentry indictment.8\n\n          In its Memorandum and Decision of April 13, 2004 (\"April\n\n13 Decision\"), the district court denied Luna's motion to dismiss,\n\nholding that he failed to establish, as required by 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1326(d)(3), that the IJ's failure to adjudicate his § 212(c)\n\napplication    prejudiced   him.    Luna   filed   a   motion   asking   the\n\ndistrict court to reconsider.      On June 1, 2004, the district court\n\nissued a second Memorandum and Decision (\"June 1 Decision\") again\n\ndenying the motion to dismiss.     The court held that, in addition to\n\nLuna’s failure to demonstrate prejudice, Luna also failed to\n\nestablish the requirement under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(d)(2) that his\n\nunderlying    deportation   proceedings    improperly   deprived   him   of\n\njudicial review.    Luna appealed.\n\n                                   III.\n\n          The underlying facts are not in dispute, and we review\n\nthe district court's legal conclusions de novo.         See United States\n\n\n\n8\n During the hearing on the motion to dismiss, the district court\nquestioned whether the first deportation order, issued in 1993,\ncould serve as a basis for the indictment for illegal reentry.\nHowever, the district court did not resolve the issue. In response\nto the district court's questioning during the hearing, the\ngovernment stated that it focused on the second order of\ndeportation because it believed that the first order of deportation\nwas defective. On appeal, both the government and the defendant\ncontinue to focus solely on the second order of deportation,\nraising no arguments regarding the possible validity of the first\ndeportation order as a basis for the indictment. Accordingly, our\nreview will focus on the second order of deportation.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fv. Loaisiga, 104 F.3d 484, 486 (1st Cir. 1997) (applying de novo\n\nstandard of review to district court's decision to grant motion to\n\ndismiss an indictment for illegal reentry under a prior version of\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1326).\n\n            The government argues that we should review the district\n\ncourt's prejudice determination for clear error.                 While we review\n\nfactual findings under a clear error standard, the prejudice\n\nanalysis in this case involves the application of law to undisputed\n\nfacts and is part of an inquiry to determine whether the defendant\n\nhas established the fundamental unfairness of his deportation\n\nhearing.     Under these circumstances, we agree with our sister\n\ncircuits    that    a    district     court's   determination     of   whether   a\n\ndefendant    has        established    prejudice      pursuant    to   8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1326(d)(3) is subject to de novo review.               See United States v.\n\nScott, 394 F.3d 111, 116-17 (2d Cir. 2005) (applying de novo review\n\nto   district      court's    determination      of   whether     defendant   has\n\nestablished prejudice under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(d)(3)); United States\n\nv. Aguirre-Tello, 353 F.3d 1199, 1204 (10th Cir. 2004) (en banc)\n\n(same); United States v. Ubaldo-Figueroa, 364 F.3d 1042, 1047 (9th\n\nCir. 2003) (same).\n\nA.   Mendoza-Lopez and 8 U.S.C. § 1326\n\n            Under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a), it is a crime for an individual\n\nwho has been deported, removed, excluded, or denied admission to\n\nenter the United States unless he or she has the prior approval of\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fthe Attorney General or shows that no such approval was needed.\n\nSection 1326(b) specifies enhanced penalties for illegal reentry\n\nbased on the person's criminal history.\n\n              In United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S. 828 (1987),\n\nthe Supreme Court held that a person who is prosecuted for illegal\n\nreentry      based    on    a    previous      order    of    deportation       must   have\n\nmeaningful review of the validity of his or her deportation order.\n\nThe defendants in Mendoza-Lopez, having been indicted for illegally\n\nreentering      the        United      States,       argued   that     their     previous\n\ndeportation proceedings were fundamentally unfair because the IJ\n\nhad failed to inform them adequately of their eligibility for\n\n\"suspension of deportation,\" a form of discretionary relief.                           See\n\nid. at 831-32.        The Supreme Court concluded that the defendants'\n\nmotions to dismiss their indictments should be granted because they\n\nhad   been    \"deprived         of    their    rights   to    appeal    [their    removal\n\norders], and of any basis to appeal since the only relief [from\n\ndeportation] for which they would have been eligible was not\n\nadequately explained to them.\" Id. at 842. As the Court explained,\n\n\"where a determination made in an administrative proceeding is to\n\nplay a critical role in the subsequent imposition of a criminal\n\nsanction,      there        must       be     some    meaningful       review     of   the\n\nadministrative proceeding.\" Id. at 837-38 (emphasis in original).\n\n              Congress essentially codified the Mendoza-Lopez decision\n\nas 8 U.S.C. § 1326(d).               See United States v. Wilson, 316 F.3d 506,\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\f515 n.1 (4th Cir. 2003) (Motz, J., concurring) (discussing the\n\nlegislative history of § 1326(d)).    Section 1326(d) provides:\n\n           In a criminal proceeding under this section,\n           an alien may not challenge the validity of the\n           deportation order . . . unless the alien\n           demonstrates that --\n                  (1)    the    alien    exhausted    any\n                  administrative remedies that may have\n                  been available to seek relief against\n                  the order;\n                  (2) the deportation proceedings at\n                  which the order was issued improperly\n                  deprived the alien of the opportunity\n                  for judicial review; and\n                  (3) the entry of the order was\n                  fundamentally unfair.\n\nThese elements are in the conjunctive; therefore, a defendant must\n\nsatisfy all of them to successfully attack his removal order. See\n\nUnited States v. Roque-Espinoza, 338 F.3d 724, 728 (7th Cir. 2003);\n\nWilson, 316 F.3d at 509; United States v. Fernandez-Antonia, 278\n\nF.3d 150, 157 (2d Cir. 2002); United States v. Lepore, 304 F. Supp.\n\n2d 183, 186 (D. Mass. 2004).\n\nB.   Application of § 1326(d) to Luna’s Case\n\n           The interpretation of this statute presents us with\n\nseveral difficult issues of first impression.    While the parties\n\nagree that Luna has met the administrative exhaustion requirement\n\nof 8 U.S.C. § 1326(d)(1),9 they disagree about whether Luna has met\n\n\n9\n Under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(d)(1), a defendant who seeks to challenge\nthe validity of his deportation order must have exhausted the\nadministrative remedies during his removal proceedings or show that\nan appropriate exception applies. See United States v. Sosa, 387\nF.3d 131, 136-37 (2d Cir. 2004) (explaining the scope of the 8\nU.S.C. § 1326(d)(1) requirement); Lepore, 304 F. Supp. 2d at 192\n\n                               -10-\n\fthe other statutory requirements.           The government argues that we\n\ncan affirm the district court's order on either of its stated\n\ngrounds –- that Luna was not deprived of judicial review under\n\n§ 1326(d)(2) or that Luna has not established prejudice as part of\n\nthe   fundamental   unfairness   inquiry       under    §    1326(d)(3).        The\n\ngovernment also argues that, alternatively, we can affirm the\n\ndistrict court's order because the defendant failed to establish\n\nthat the errors in his hearing, even if prejudicial, rendered his\n\ndeportation order fundamentally unfair under § 1326(d)(3).                      Luna\n\nargues that he meets all the statutory requirements.                  We address\n\nthese   arguments   and    discuss    the   second     and    third   prongs     of\n\n§   1326(d).    However,    because    we    conclude       that   Luna   has   not\n\nestablished prejudice under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(d)(3), we need not\n\nultimately resolve all the statutory issues.\n\n           1.   Section 1326(d)(2):         Deprivation of Judicial Review\n\n           Under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(d)(2), a defendant who seeks to\n\nchallenge the validity of his deportation order must demonstrate\n\nthat \"the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued\n\nimproperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial\n\nreview.\"   In its June 1 Decision, the district court held that Luna\n\ndid not meet this requirement because he had an opportunity for\n\n\n(same). We agree with the parties and the district court that Luna\nmet this requirement by appealing the IJ's decision to the BIA in\nhis case. See United States v. Perez, 330 F.3d 97, 100-01 (2d Cir.\n2003) (indicating that an appeal of an IJ's decision or a denial of\na motion to reopen to the BIA will satisfy 8 U.S.C. § 1326(d)(1)).\n\n                                     -11-\n\fjudicial review -- a writ of habeas corpus -- but failed to pursue\n\nit.10   Luna argues that the IJ and the BIA effectively deprived him\n\nof judicial review by failing to properly inform him of his\n\neligibility for relief, adjudicate his application for relief, or\n\ninform him of any right to appeal.\n\n            We   have   not   previously   interpreted   § 1326(d)(2).11\n\n\n10\n The availability of habeas review was a contested issue at the\ntime of Luna's deportation proceedings. AEDPA and IIRIRA amended\nthe INA to statutorily bar people with certain criminal convictions\nfrom seeking review of their final orders of removal through a\npetition for review to the courts of appeals. See 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1252(a)(2)(c) (\"[N]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any\nfinal order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason\nof having committed a criminal offense [under certain sections of\nthe INA] . . . .\") (amended 2005).      During the time of Luna's\ndeportation proceedings, the government was advancing the argument\nthat no court had jurisdiction over such cases, even if the\nindividual filed a writ of habeas corpus.        The Supreme Court\neventually rejected this argument. See St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 314\n(concluding that provisions barring certain people from pursuing\ndirect review of their orders of removal do not apply to habeas\nreview under 28 U.S.C. § 2241).\n11\n We reject the government's suggestion that our precedent\ninterpreting Mendoza-Lopez resolves this issue.       Prior to the\nenactment of § 1326(d), we applied Mendoza-Lopez and held that\ndefendants who deliberately and voluntarily withdrew their right to\nadministratively appeal an IJ's decision to the BIA under the\nadvice of counsel cannot show that they were deprived of meaningful\njudicial review. See United States v. Smith, 36 F.3d 128, 130-31\n(1st Cir. 1994) (no deprivation of meaningful review where\ndefendant under advice of counsel signed a motion withdrawing his\nappeal and provided no evidence that his waiver was involuntary);\nUnited States v. Smith, 14 F.3d 662, 664-65 (1st Cir. 1994) (no\ndeprivation of meaningful review where defendant under advice of\ncounsel filed an appeal but then later voluntarily withdrew his\nappeal); United States v. Vieira-Candelario, 6 F.3d 12, 15 (1st\nCir. 1993) (same).     These cases are distinguishable from the\ninstant case because the defendants in those cases, unlike Luna,\nchose, on the advice of legal counsel, to affirmatively abandon\ntheir appeals.   See Lepore, 304 F. Supp. 2d at 195 (discussing\n\n                                   -12-\n\fHowever, Mendoza-Lopez provides some guidance.            The Supreme Court\n\nheld that an IJ's failure to adequately explain the availability of\n\nrelief, resulting in an uninformed waiver of the right to appeal,\n\nwas an error that deprived the individuals in that case of their\n\nopportunity for judicial review.        Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S. at 842.\n\nOther than this specific holding, however, the Supreme Court has\n\ndeclined to further \"enumerate which procedural errors are so\n\nfundamental    that   they    may   functionally    deprive     the   alien    of\n\njudicial review.\"     See id. at 839 n.17.\n\n             In this case, the government essentially argues that, as\n\nthe district court concluded, the availability of judicial review\n\nthrough a writ of habeas corpus is fatal to the defendant's claim\n\nunder § 1326(d)(2).         However, the conclusions of the few courts\n\nthat have considered this argument have not been uniform.              Compare\n\nSosa, 387 F.3d at 137 (\"[T]he fact that [a chance to file a habeas\n\npetition] technically existed does not necessarily mean that [the\n\ndefendant] had an 'opportunity for judicial review' within the\n\nmeaning of Section 1326(d)(2).\") and United States v. Copeland, 376\n\nF.3d 61, 68 (2d Cir. 2004) (noting that \"[i]n Mendoza-Lopez itself,\n\nhabeas review was apparently available to the aliens, yet the Court\n\nheld that they were deprived of judicial review\") with Roque-\n\nEspinoza, 338 F.3d at 729 (\"Even though [the defendant] may have\n\nhad   good   reason   for    thinking   that   he   was   not   eligible      for\n\n\ncases).\n\n                                     -13-\n\fdiscretionary relief from removal, because the IJ had so informed\n\nhim, he should have realized that avenues of judicial review were\n\navailable to him.\").\n\n           Given the uncertainty in the law on this issue, we turn\n\nto § 1326(d)(3).     Because, as we explain below, we conclude that\n\nLuna has not established prejudice, we need not decide whether,\n\nunder § 1326(d)(2), the errors in Luna's case functionally deprived\n\nhim of judicial review despite the availability of habeas review.\n\n           2. Section 1326(d)(3): Fundamental Unfairness\n\n           A defendant who seeks to challenge the validity of his\n\ndeportation order must demonstrate that \"the entry of the order was\n\nfundamentally unfair.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1326(d)(3).         Under this prong,\n\ncourts   uniformly   require   a   showing   of   procedural   error   and\n\nprejudice.   See, e.g., Aguirre-Tello, 353 F.3d at 1207-08; Perez,\n\n330 F.3d at 103-04; Ubaldo-Figueroa, 364 F.3d at 1050; Wilson, 316\n\nF.3d at 510.\n\n           Courts disagree, however, on what type of procedural\n\nerror, if prejudicial, would result in a fundamentally unfair\n\ndeportation order under the statute.      The Third, Fourth, and Fifth\n\nCircuits have held that § 1326(d)(3) requires a showing that the\n\nerror in the deportation hearing has resulted in a deprivation of\n\na liberty or property interest.      See United States v. Torres, 383\n\nF.3d 92, 103 (3rd Cir. 2004); Wilson, 316 F.3d at 510; United\n\nStates v. Lopez-Ortiz, 313 F.3d 225, 230 (5th Cir. 2002).          These\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fcourts have rejected the argument that an agency's failure to\n\nadequately inform an immigrant of his or her eligibility for\n\n§ 212(c) relief can establish fundamental unfairness, because an\n\napplicant has no liberty or property interest in discretionary\n\nrelief.     See Torres, 383 F.3d at 103 (\"[B]ecause discretionary\n\nrelief is necessarily a matter of grace rather than of right,\n\naliens do not have a due process liberty interest in consideration\n\nfor such relief.\"); Wilson, 316 F.3d at 510 (\"[S]ection 212(c) does\n\nnot create an entitlement, but is rather completely discretionary\n\nin nature.\"); Lopez-Ortiz, 313 F.3d at 230 (\"Because eligibility\n\nfor   §   212(c)   relief   is    not    a     liberty   or    property   interest\n\nwarranting due process protection, we hold that the Immigration\n\nJudge's error in failing to explain Lopez-Ortiz's eligibility does\n\nnot rise to the level of fundamental unfairness.\").\n\n            The Second and Ninth Circuits have taken a different\n\napproach. These courts have held that an agency's violation of the\n\nprocedural    protections        in   its      statute    or    regulations,    if\n\nprejudicial to the person facing deportation, can demonstrate\n\nfundamental unfairness under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(d)(3).                See Copeland,\n\n376 F.3d at 71-73; Ubaldo-Figueroa, 364 F.3d at 1042.                          They\n\nconclude, therefore, that an agency's failure to adequately inform\n\nan immigrant of his or her eligibility for § 212(c) relief, if\n\nprejudicial, can render the deportation fundamentally unfair.                   See\n\nCopeland, 376 F.3d at 72 (\"The decisions holding that a failure to\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\finform an alien about Section 212(c) relief cannot be a fundamental\n\nerror collapse [the] distinction [between a right to seek relief\n\nand the right to that relief itself] . . . .           The issue, therefore,\n\nis not whether Section 212(c) relief is constitutionally mandated,\n\nbut    whether   a   denial   of   an    established   right    [under   agency\n\nregulations] to be informed of the possibility of such relief can,\n\nif prejudicial, be a fundamental procedural error.\"); Ubaldo-\n\nFigueroa, 364 F.3d at 1042 (\"The requirement that the IJ inform an\n\nalien of his or her ability to apply for relief from removal is\n\n'mandatory,' and 'failure to so inform the alien [of his or her\n\neligibility for relief from removal] is a denial of due process\n\nthat    invalidates     the   underlying       deportation     proceedings.'\")\n\n(quoting United States v. Muro-Inclan, 249 F.3d 1180, 1183 (9th\n\nCir. 2001)).\n\n            Although we have not interpreted § 1326(d)(3), we have\n\nanalyzed whether a deportation order was \"fundamentally flawed\" in\n\nthe context of a defendant's challenge to his indictment for\n\nillegal reentry after Mendoza-Lopez. Loaisiga, 104 F.3d at 484-85.\n\nThe defendant in Loaisiga claimed that he was not adequately\n\nadvised of his right to self-obtained counsel.           Id.    We stated that\n\nwe would \"assume without deciding that it would be a fundamental\n\nflaw under Mendoza-Lopez to fail to advise one threatened with\n\ndeportation of his statutory right to self-obtained counsel.\"               Id.\n\nat 486.    However, we found that the IJ complied with all relevant\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fstatutory and regulatory requirements. See id. at 485-86. We then\n\nstated that \"it has been left primarily to Congress and to INS\n\nregulations to dictate the course of proceedings -- which both\n\nbodies have done in some detail . . . .     Courts normally require\n\nnothing more in the way of procedural protection, except to prevent\n\nflagrant abuses -- normally those rising to the level of due\n\nprocess violations.\" Id. at 486 (emphasis in original).      Having\n\nfound no statutory or regulatory violations, we asked whether the\n\nIJ violated the defendant's constitutional rights.\n\n             We did not resolve all of the constitutional issues,\n\nhowever.12    We held that, \"for a collateral attack on a now-final\n\ndeportation order, the defendant must show prejudice.\"   Id. at 487\n\n(emphasis in original).      Because Loaisiga had not demonstrated\n\nprejudice, we held that he could not collaterally attack the\n\nvalidity of his deportation order.\n\n\n\n12\n We noted that the IJ had repeatedly advised Loaisiga of his right\nto self-obtained counsel and had given him three weeks to seek an\nattorney prior to his deportation hearing. See Loaisiga, 104 F.3d\nat 486. In light of those facts, we rejected Loaisiga's claim that\nthe IJ violated due process by failing to advise Loaisiga again of\nhis right to counsel at the beginning of the hearing. Id.\n(\"[A]bsent some signal from Loaisiga -- such as a plausible request\nfor a further delay -- we do not think that it was even close to a\ndue process violation for the immigration judge to move on to the\nmerits.\").    However, we did not decide whether \"due process\nrequired that Loaisiga be advised again at the close of the []\nhearing of his right to obtain his own counsel for an appeal.\" Id.\nat 487 (emphasis in original) (noting that \"a respondent's\ninclination to appeal might be affected by being told (again) that\nhe could be represented by counsel\" but concluding that \"this\ninteresting issue need not be decided here\").\n\n                                -17-\n\f          In this case, the IJ failed to inform Luna of his\n\neligibility for § 212(c) relief, provide him with an opportunity to\n\napply for that relief, or adjudicate his application for relief.13\n\nThe government argues that the errors do not render the entry of\n\nthe   deportation     order   fundamentally         unfair      under    8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1326(d)(3).    However, as was the case in Loaisiga, we do not have\n\nto resolve the question of whether the agency's errors in this case\n\nwould,   if    prejudicial,    render       the     deportation         proceedings\n\nfundamentally unfair.      We agree with the district court's holding\n\nthat Luna has not demonstrated prejudice.\n\n          As    discussed     above,    the       facts    of    this    case   are\n\nundisputed,     and   we    review     de   novo     the     district        court's\n\ndetermination that Luna has failed to establish prejudice.                      The\n\nstandard for prejudice in this context is \"a reasonable likelihood\n\nthat the result would have been different if the error in the\n\ndeportation proceeding had not occurred.”                 Loaisiga, 104 F.3d at\n\n\n\n13\n See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.11(a)(2) (\"The immigration judge shall inform\nthe alien of his or her apparent eligibility to apply for any of\nthe benefits [of relief from deportation] enumerated in this\nchapter and shall afford the alien an opportunity to make an\napplication during the hearing.\") (emphasis added); 8 C.F.R. §\n242.17(a) (amended 1998) (\"The immigration judge shall inform the\nrespondent of his or her apparent eligibility to apply for any of\nthe benefits enumerated in this paragraph and shall afford the\nrespondent an opportunity to make application therefor during the\nhearing.\"); 8 C.F.R. § 212.3(e) (\"An application for the exercise\nof discretion under section 212(c) of the Act may be . . .\nsubmitted in proceedings before an Immigration Judge. . . . Such\napplication shall be adjudicated by the Immigration Judge.\")\n(emphasis added).\n\n                                     -18-\n\f487.14    In other words, the defendant must show that, if the IJ had\n\nadjudicated      his   §   212(c)   application,   there   is    a   reasonable\n\nlikelihood that he would have received relief from deportation.\n\n               Given the undisputed factual findings of the district\n\ncourt, we therefore must consider how the IJ itself would consider\n\nthese factors when adjudicating a § 212(c) waiver application.               In\n\nits decisions, the agency has \"developed criteria, comparable to\n\ncommon-law rules, for deciding when deportation is appropriate.\"\n\nSt. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 295 n.5 (citing Matter of Marin, 16 I. & N.\n\nDec.     581    (BIA   1978)).      These    criteria   have    included   \"the\n\nseriousness of the offense, evidence of either rehabilitation or\n\nrecidivism, the duration of the alien's residence, the impact of\n\ndeportation on the family, the number of citizens in the family,\n\nand the character of any service in the Armed Forces.\"               Id.   Other\n\nfactors include arrival in the United States as a child, history of\n\nemployment, property or business ties, community service, and\n\nevidence of good character.           Marin, 16 I. & N. Dec. at 584-85.\n\nAfter noting all the factors in an individual's case, an IJ \"must\n\nbalance the adverse factors evidencing an alien's undesirability .\n\n. . with the social and humane considerations presented in his\n\nbehalf.\"       Id. at 584.\n\n\n14\n There may be some cases where the agency’s violation of a\npetitioner’s rights was \"so flagrant, and the difficulty of proving\nprejudice so great\" that prejudice may be presumed, Loaisiga, 104\nF.3d at 488, but no court has applied that concept to the context\nof the failure to adjudicate an application for § 212(c) relief.\n\n                                      -19-\n\f            Individuals with particularly lengthy or violent criminal\n\nhistories   are   generally   required     to   show   particularly      strong\n\ncountervailing    equities    or   rehabilitation      to   obtain   §   212(c)\n\nrelief.15 See Scott, 394 F.3d at 120-21. However, criminal history\n\nis not a per-se bar to relief.16     See Lepore, 304 F. Supp. 2d at 199\n\n(\"It is important to remember that, by definition, 'aggravated\n\nfelons' are eligible for relief, so the fact that [an applicant for\n\n§ 212(c) relief] is a convicted criminal cannot be dispositive.\").\n\n\n\n15\n The BIA has explained that, \"as the negative factors grow more\nserious, it becomes incumbent upon the alien to introduce\nadditional offsetting favorable evidence, which in some cases may\nhave to involve unusual or outstanding equities.\" Marin, 16 I. & N.\nDec. at 585. A single criminal act, depending on the seriousness\nof the underlying conduct, or \"a succession of criminal acts, which\ntogether establish a pattern of serious criminal misconduct\" can\ntrigger this heightened requirement. Matter of Buscemi, 19 I. & N.\nDec. 628, 633 (BIA 1988). While evidence of rehabilitation is one\nfactor often considered in this context, the BIA has indicated that\nan IJ must consider the circumstances faced by the applicant for\n§ 212(c) relief, particularly the difficulties that incarceration\nmay pose. See In re Arreguin De Rodriguez, 21 I. & N. Dec. 38, 40\n(BIA 1995) (\"A clear showing of reformation is not an absolute\nprerequisite to a favorable exercise of discretion in every section\n212(c) application involving an alien with a criminal record.\nSection 212(c) applications involving convicted aliens must be\nevaluated on a case-by-case basis, with rehabilitation a factor to\nbe considered in the exercise of discretion. . . . We recognize\nthe difficulties an incarcerated alien faces in demonstrating\nconvincing efforts towards rehabilitation. . . . [A]ny efforts\nwill be considered, and the applicant is not barred automatically\nfrom discretionary relief by her incarceration.\" (citations\nomitted)).\n16\n Indeed, we have noted that the grant of discretionary relief for\nindividuals with criminal convictions \"was not rare: in the years\nimmediately preceding the [statutory repeal of § 212(c) relief for\n'aggravated felons'], over half the applications were granted.\"\nMattis v. Reno, 212 F.3d 31, 33 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                                    -20-\n\fFurthermore, only criminal history that occurred prior to the\n\nchallenged deportation hearing should be considered when assessing\n\nprejudice in the § 1326(d) context.         See Scott, 394 F.3d at 118\n\n(\"[Section 1326(d)(3)]’s focus on the 'entry' of the order suggests\n\na temporal limitation on the district court’s inquiry.           In other\n\nwords, the statute itself indicates that . . .        the only pertinent\n\nissue is whether entry of the deportation order . . . prejudiced\n\n[the   defendant]   --   regardless   of   [the   defendant]’s   potential\n\ndeportability for some later crimes.”).\n\n           Because of the multitude of factors involved in this\n\ninquiry, the “[r]esolution of the prejudice issue in the Section\n\n1326(d)(3) context is somewhat akin to a trial within a trial. . .\n\n.    The court must first obtain all of the facts relevant to the\n\nparticular alien and then apply standards established under Section\n\n212(c) to those facts . . . .”        Copeland, 376 F.3d at 73-74.\n\n           In this case, the district court heard arguments on the\n\nmotion to dismiss and considered the entire record.17       The district\n\ncourt noted six factors that could weigh in favor of Luna’s case,\n\nincluding that (1) over fifty percent of those who apply for\n\n§ 212(c) relief are granted such relief; (2) defendants with felony\n\nrecords are eligible for § 212(c) waivers; (3) Luna was abused as\n\na child for ten years, (4) most of Luna's family members, including\n\n\n\n17\n The defendant, through counsel, did not request to submit any\nadditional evidence in support of his prejudice argument.\n\n                                  -21-\n\fhis parents and five siblings, were present in the United States at\n\nthe time of his deportation hearing; (5) Luna had an opportunity to\n\nrehabilitate himself in prison; and (6) Luna has lived in the\n\nUnited States for the majority of his life.\n\n          The district court then considered three factors weighing\n\nagainst Luna’s case, including that (1) Luna returned to the United\n\nStates in defiance of a court order (referencing Luna's first\n\ndeportation hearing and reentry); (2) Luna admitted to convictions\n\nfor grand larceny and assault (for the brutal assault of a twelve-\n\nyear-old child) in his deportation hearings18 and (3) Luna's lack\n\nof specific employment history.       The court concluded that Luna\n\nfailed to establish prejudice, noting that \"[a]lthough Defendant\n\nrecites several factors he believes support his application for\n\nsection 212(c) relief, he falls short of convincing this Court that\n\nthose favorable factors outweigh the adverse ones, especially\n\nDefendant's violent criminal history.\"\n\n          As a preliminary matter, we note that Luna’s first\n\ndeportation order and reentry should not factor into the prejudice\n\nanalysis, given the agency’s recognition of the “serious errors”\n\nmade in his first deportation proceedings. The IJ in Luna’s second\n\ndeportation hearing was so troubled by the errors that he did not\n\nconsider the first deportation hearing and reentry as grounds for\n\n\n18\n Along with these convictions, Luna's criminal history prior to his\nsecond deportation includes convictions for possession of a stolen\nvehicle and burglary.\n\n                               -22-\n\fdeportation.    Given this determination, it is unlikely that the IJ\n\nwould have considered that reentry in an adjudication of Luna's\n\n§ 212(c) application.\n\n            Putting aside that factor, however, we nonetheless agree\n\nwith the district court’s conclusion.         Luna has a serious criminal\n\nhistory, including numerous offenses and a violent crime against a\n\nchild.     Although he asserts that he has had the opportunity to\n\nrehabilitate    himself,   he   fails    to   specify   any   evidence   of\n\nrehabilitation or good character.        Luna lacks a history of steady\n\nemployment and points to no evidence of positive contributions to\n\nsociety.    Furthermore, although Luna's parents and siblings are in\n\nthis country, Luna fails to describe his relationship with them and\n\nthe extent of the hardship that they will face if he is deported.\n\nWe have carefully considered the favorable equities that Luna does\n\nassert, particularly his lengthy residency here since infancy.\n\nHowever, on the balance, we conclude that there is no reasonable\n\nlikelihood that the agency would have granted a waiver in his case.\n\nWhile none of the aforementioned factors, taken alone, would\n\nnecessarily doom Luna's application, we conclude that his lengthy\n\ncriminal history, the violent nature of his criminal activity, and\n\nthe relative lack of positive equities eliminate any reasonable\n\nlikelihood that he would have received a grant of relief.\n\n            Because Luna has failed to demonstrate prejudice under\n\n§ 1326(d), the district court properly denied his motion to dismiss\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\fthe indictment for illegal reentry.   The decision of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -24-\n\f",

His immediate family members, including his mother, father, and siblings, all live in the United States. Luna spent most of his childhood in Rhode Island, where he attended school until the 9th grade.

He returned to the United States at some point thereafter. On January 22, 1996, Luna pled guilty in state court to second degree assault. He was sentenced to three to six years imprisonment. While he was serving his sentence, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") issued an Order to Show Cause charging that Luna was deportable on several grounds, including his assault conviction and his previous deportation order and reentry. Given \"serious problems\" regarding the validity of the previous deportation order,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") found that Luna was deportable on the sole ground of being an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, <i>see</i> Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") &#167; 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (formerly INA &#167; 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1251 (redesignated 1996)), based on his second degree assault conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During his hearing before the IJ, Luna applied for discretionary relief, requesting a waiver of deportation under former INA &#167; 212(c). 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c) (repealed 1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The IJ did not consider the merits of Luna's application for relief, stating in his oral decision that \"the respondent is statutorily barred from this and any other forms of relief from deportation\" under the Attorney General's decision in <i>In re Soriano,</i> 21 I. &amp; N.

He filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(d),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> arguing that his deportation was fundamentally unfair and thus could not serve as the basis for his illegal reentry indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its Memorandum and Decision of April 13, 2004 (\"April 13 Decision\"), the district court denied Luna's motion to dismiss, holding that he failed to establish, as required by 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(d)(3), that the IJ's failure to adjudicate his &#167; 212(c) application prejudiced him. Luna filed a motion asking the district court to reconsider. On June 1, 2004, the district court issued a second Memorandum and Decision (\"June 1 Decision\") again denying the motion to dismiss. The court held that, in addition to Luna's failure to demonstrate prejudice, Luna also failed to establish the requirement under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(d)(2) that his underlying deportation proceedings improperly deprived him of judicial review.

While we review factual findings under a clear error standard, the prejudice analysis in this case involves the application of law to undisputed facts and is part of an inquiry to determine whether the defendant has established the fundamental unfairness of his deportation hearing. Under these circumstances, we agree with our sister circuits that a district court's determination of whether a defendant has established prejudice pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(d)(3) is subject to <i>de novo</i> review. <i>See United States v.

The defendants in <i>Mendoza-Lopez,</i> having been indicted for illegally reentering the United States, argued that their previous deportation proceedings were fundamentally unfair because the IJ had failed to inform them adequately of their eligibility for \"suspension of deportation,\" a form of discretionary relief. <i>See id.</i> at 831-32, 107 S.Ct. 2148. The Supreme Court concluded that the defendants' motions to dismiss their indictments should be granted because they had been \"deprived of their rights to appeal [their removal orders], and of any basis to appeal since the only relief [from deportation] for which they would have been eligible was not adequately explained to them.\" <i>Id.</i> at 842, 107 S.Ct. 2148. As the Court explained, \"where a determination made in an administrative proceeding is to play a critical role in the subsequent imposition of a criminal sanction, there must be <i>some</i> meaningful review of the administrative proceeding.\" <i>Id.</i> at 837-38, 107 S.Ct. 2148 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress essentially codified the <i>Mendoza-Lopez</i> decision as 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(d). <i>See United States v.

While the parties agree that Luna has met the administrative exhaustion requirement of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(d)(1),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> they disagree about whether Luna has met the other statutory requirements. The government argues that we can affirm the district court's order on either of its stated grounds &#8212; that Luna was not deprived of judicial review under &#167; 1326(d)(2) or that Luna has not established prejudice as part of the fundamental unfairness inquiry under &#167; 1326(d)(3). The government also argues that, alternatively, we can affirm the district court's order because the defendant failed to establish that the errors in his hearing, even if prejudicial, rendered his deportation order fundamentally unfair under &#167; 1326(d)(3). Luna argues that he meets all the statutory requirements. We address these arguments and discuss the second and third prongs of &#167; 1326(d). However, because we conclude that Luna has not established prejudice under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(d)(3), we need not ultimately resolve all the statutory issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

The Supreme Court held that an IJ's failure to adequately explain the availability of relief, resulting in an uninformed waiver of the right to appeal, was an error that deprived the individuals in that case of their opportunity for judicial review. <i>Mendoza-Lopez,</i> 481 U.S. at 842, 107 S.Ct. 2148. Other than this specific holding, however, the Supreme Court has declined to further \"enumerate which procedural errors are so fundamental that they may functionally deprive the alien of judicial review.\" <i>See id.</i> at 839, 107 S.Ct. 2148 n. 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the government essentially argues that, as the district court concluded, the availability of judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus is fatal to the defendant's claim under &#167; 1326(d)(2). However, the conclusions of the few courts that have considered this argument have not been uniform. <i>Compare Sosa,</i> 387 F.3d at 137 (\"[T]he fact that [a chance to file a habeas petition] technically existed does not necessarily mean that [the defendant] had an `opportunity for judicial review' within the meaning of Section 1326(d)(2).\") <i>and United States v. Copeland,</i> 376 F.3d 61, 68 (2d Cir.2004) (noting that \"[i]n <i>Mendoza-Lopez</i> itself, habeas review was apparently available to the aliens, yet the Court held that they were deprived of judicial review\") <i>with Roque-Espinoza,</i> 338 F.3d at 729 (\"Even though [the defendant] may have had good reason for thinking that he was not eligible for discretionary relief from removal, because the IJ had so informed him, he should have realized that avenues of judicial review were available to him.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the uncertainty in the law on this issue, we turn to &#167; 1326(d)(3). Because, as we explain below, we conclude that Luna has not established prejudice, we need not decide whether, under &#167; 1326(d)(2), the errors in Luna's case functionally deprived him of judicial review despite the availability of habeas review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

Under this prong, courts uniformly require a showing of procedural error and prejudice. <i>See, e.g., Aguirre-Tello,</i> 353 F.3d at 1207-08; <i>Perez,</i> 330 F.3d at 103-04; <i>Ubaldo-Figueroa,</i> 364 F.3d at 1050; <i>Wilson,</i> 316 F.3d at 510.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts disagree, however, on what type of procedural error, if prejudicial, would result in a fundamentally unfair deportation order under the statute. The Third, Fourth, and Fifth Circuits have held that &#167; 1326(d)(3) requires a showing that the error in the deportation hearing has resulted in a deprivation of a liberty or property interest. <i>See United States v. Torres,</i> 383 F.3d 92, 103 (3rd Cir.2004); <i>Wilson,</i> 316 F.3d at 510; <i>United States v. Lopez-Ortiz,</i> 313 F.3d 225, 230 (5th Cir.2002). These courts have rejected the argument that an agency's failure to adequately inform an immigrant of his or her eligibility for &#167; 212(c) relief can establish fundamental unfairness, because an applicant has no liberty or property interest in discretionary relief. <i>See Torres,</i> 383 F.3d at 103 (\"[B]ecause discretionary relief is necessarily a matter of grace rather than of right, aliens do not have a due process liberty interest in consideration for such relief.\"); <i>Wilson,</i> 316 F.3d at 510 (\"[S]ection 212(c) does not create an entitlement, but is rather completely discretionary in nature.\"); <i>Lopez-Ortiz,</i> 313 F.3d at 230 (\"Because eligibility for &#167; 212(c) relief is not a liberty or property interest warranting due process protection, we hold that the Immigration Judge's error in failing to explain Lopez-Ortiz's eligibility does not rise to the level of fundamental unfairness.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second and Ninth Circuits have taken a different approach. These courts have held that an agency's violation of the procedural protections in its statute or regulations, if prejudicial to the person facing deportation, can demonstrate fundamental unfairness under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(d)(3). <i>See Copeland,</i> 376 F.3d at 71-73; <i>Ubaldo-Figueroa,</i> 364 F.3d at 1042. They conclude, therefore, that an agency's failure to adequately inform an immigrant of his or her eligibility for &#167; 212(c) relief, if prejudicial, can render the deportation fundamentally unfair. <i>See Copeland,</i> 376 F.3d at 72 (\"The decisions holding that a failure to inform an alien about Section 212(c) relief cannot be a fundamental error collapse [the] distinction [between a right to seek relief and the right to that relief itself].... The issue, therefore, is not whether Section 212(c) relief is constitutionally mandated, but whether a denial of an established right [under agency regulations] to be informed of the possibility of such relief can, if prejudicial, be a fundamental procedural error.\"); <i>Ubaldo-Figueroa,</i> 364 F.3d at 1042 (\"The requirement that the IJ inform an alien of his or her ability to apply for relief from removal is `mandatory,' and `failure to so inform the alien [of his or her eligibility for relief from removal] is a denial of due process that invalidates the underlying deportation proceedings.'\") (quoting <i>United States v.

The defendant in <i>Loaisiga</i> claimed that he was not adequately advised of his right to self-obtained counsel. <i>Id.</i> We stated that we would \"assume without deciding that it would be a fundamental flaw under <i>Mendoza-Lopez</i> to fail to advise one threatened with deportation of his statutory right to self-obtained counsel.\" <i>Id.</i> at 486. However, we found that the IJ complied with all relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. <i>See id.</i> at 485-86. We then stated that \"it has been left primarily to Congress and to INS regulations to dictate the course of proceedings &#8212; which both bodies have done in some detail....

The standard for prejudice in this context is \"a reasonable likelihood that the result would have been different if the error in the deportation proceeding had not occurred.\" <i>Loaisiga,</i> 104 F.3d at 487.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> In other words, the defendant must show that, if the IJ had adjudicated his &#167; 212(c) application, there is a reasonable likelihood that he would have received relief from deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the undisputed factual findings of the district court, we therefore must consider how the IJ itself would consider these factors when adjudicating a &#167; 212(c) waiver application. In its decisions, the agency has \"developed criteria, comparable to common-law rules, for deciding when deportation is appropriate.\" <i>St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. at 295, 121 S.Ct. 2271 n. 5 (citing <i>Matter of Marin,</i> 16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 581 (BIA 1978)). These criteria have included \"the seriousness of the offense, evidence of either rehabilitation or recidivism, the duration of the alien's residence, the impact of deportation on the family, the number of citizens in the family, and the character of any service in the Armed Forces.\" <i>Id.</i> Other factors include arrival in the United States as a child, history of employment, property or business ties, community service, and evidence of good character. <i>Marin,</i> 16 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 584-85. After noting all the factors in an individual's case, an IJ \"must balance the adverse factors evidencing an alien's undesirability ... with the social and humane considerations presented in his behalf.\" <i>Id.</i> at 584.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Individuals with particularly lengthy or violent criminal histories are generally required to show particularly strong countervailing equities or rehabilitation to obtain &#167; 212(c) relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> <i>See Scott,</i> 394 F.3d at 120-21. However, criminal history is not a per-se bar to relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> <i>See Lepore,</i> 304 F.Supp.2d at 199 (\"It is important to remember that, by definition, `aggravated felons' are eligible for relief, so the fact that [an applicant for &#167; 212(c) relief] is a convicted criminal cannot be dispositive.\"). Furthermore, only criminal history that occurred prior to the challenged deportation hearing should be considered when assessing prejudice in the &#167; 1326(d) context. <i>See Scott,</i> 394 F.3d at 118 (\"[Section 1326(d)(3)]'s focus on the `entry' of the order suggests a temporal limitation on the district court's inquiry. In other words, the statute itself indicates that ... the only pertinent issue is whether entry of the deportation order ... prejudiced [the defendant] &#8212; regardless of [the defendant]'s potential deportability for some later crimes.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the multitude of factors involved in this inquiry, the \"[r]esolution of the prejudice issue in the Section 1326(d)(3) context is somewhat akin to a trial within a trial.... The court must first obtain all of the facts relevant to the particular alien and then apply standards established under Section 212(c) to those facts....\" <i>Copeland,</i> 376 F.3d at 73-74.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court heard arguments on the motion to dismiss and considered the entire record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> The district court noted six factors that could weigh in favor of Luna's case, including that (1) over fifty percent of those who apply for &#167; 212(c) relief are granted such relief; (2) defendants with felony records are eligible for &#167; 212(c) waivers; (3) Luna was abused as a child for ten years, (4) most of Luna's family members, including his parents and five siblings, were present in the United States at the time of his deportation hearing; (5) Luna had an opportunity to rehabilitate himself in prison; and (6) Luna has lived in the United States for the majority of his life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then considered three factors weighing against Luna's case, including that (1) Luna returned to the United States in defiance of a court order (referencing Luna's first deportation hearing and reentry); (2) Luna admitted to convictions for grand larceny and assault (for the brutal assault of a twelve-year-old child) in his deportation hearings<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> and (3) Luna's lack of specific employment history. The court concluded that Luna failed to establish prejudice, noting that \"[a]lthough Defendant recites several factors he believes support his application for section 212(c) relief, he falls short of convincing this Court that those favorable factors outweigh the adverse ones, especially Defendant's violent criminal history.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preliminary matter, we note that Luna's first deportation order and reentry should not factor into the prejudice analysis, given the agency's recognition of the \"serious errors\" made in his first deportation proceedings. The IJ in Luna's second deportation hearing was so troubled by the errors that he did not consider the first deportation hearing and reentry as grounds for deportation. Given this determination, it is unlikely that the IJ would have considered that reentry in an adjudication of Luna's &#167; 212(c) application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Putting aside that factor, however, we nonetheless agree with the district court's conclusion. Luna has a serious criminal history, including numerous offenses and a violent crime against a child. Although he asserts that he has had the opportunity to rehabilitate himself, he fails to specify any evidence of rehabilitation or good character. Luna lacks a history of steady employment and points to no evidence of positive contributions to society. Furthermore, although Luna's parents and siblings are in this country, Luna fails to describe his relationship with them and the extent of the hardship that they will face if he is deported. We have carefully considered the favorable equities that Luna does assert, particularly his lengthy residency here since infancy. However, on the balance, we conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the agency would have granted a waiver in his case. While none of the aforementioned factors, taken alone, would necessarily doom Luna's application, we conclude that his lengthy criminal history, the violent nature of his criminal activity, and the relative lack of positive equities eliminate any reasonable likelihood that he would have received a grant of relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Luna has failed to demonstrate prejudice under &#167; 1326(d), the district court properly denied his motion to dismiss the indictment for illegal reentry.

In addition, the IJ noted that \"as a matter of equity, [Luna] testified that he did not appear in court because his child died immediately before the immigration hearing ... and therefore his attendance there was impossible.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Former &#167; 212(c) provided that \"[a]liens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General....

During the time of Luna's deportation proceedings, the government was advancing the argument that no court had jurisdiction over such cases, even if the individual filed a writ of habeas corpus. The Supreme Court eventually rejected this argument. <i>See St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. at 314, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (concluding that provisions barring certain people from pursuing direct review of their orders of removal do not apply to habeas review under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> We reject the government's suggestion that our precedent interpreting<i>Mendoza-Lopez</i> resolves this issue. Prior to the enactment of &#167; 1326(d), we applied <i>Mendoza-Lopez</i> and held that defendants who deliberately and voluntarily withdrew their right to administratively appeal an IJ's decision to the BIA under the advice of counsel cannot show that they were deprived of meaningful judicial review. <i>See United States v. Smith,</i> 36 F.3d 128, 130-31 (1st Cir.1994) (no deprivation of meaningful review where defendant under advice of counsel signed a motion withdrawing his appeal and provided no evidence that his waiver was involuntary); <i>United States v.

The government also argues that, alternatively, we can affirm the district court's order because the defendant failed to establish that the errors in his hearing, even if prejudicial, rendered his deportation order fundamentally unfair under &#167; 1326(d)(3). Luna argues that he meets all the statutory requirements. We address these arguments and discuss the second and third prongs of &#167; 1326(d). However, because we conclude that Luna has not established prejudice under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(d)(3), we need not ultimately resolve all the statutory issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

The Supreme Court held that an IJ's failure to adequately explain the availability of relief, resulting in an uninformed waiver of the right to appeal, was an error that deprived the individuals in that case of their opportunity for judicial review. <i>Mendoza-Lopez,</i> 481 U.S. at 842, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111894\"><a href=\"/opinion/111894/united-states-v-mendoza-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, the conclusions of the few courts that have considered this argument have not been uniform. <i>Compare Sosa,</i> 387 F.3d at 137 (\"[T]he fact that [a chance to file a habeas petition] technically existed does not necessarily mean that [the defendant] had an `opportunity for judicial review' within the meaning of Section 1326(d)(2).\") <i>and United States v.

Because, as we explain below, we conclude that Luna has not established prejudice, we need not decide whether, under &#167; 1326(d)(2), the errors in Luna's case functionally deprived him of judicial review despite the availability of habeas review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

The Third, Fourth, and Fifth Circuits have held that &#167; 1326(d)(3) requires a showing that the error in the deportation hearing has resulted in a deprivation of a liberty or property interest. <i>See United States v.

These courts have rejected the argument that an agency's failure to adequately inform an immigrant of his or her eligibility for &#167; 212(c) relief can establish fundamental unfairness, because an applicant has no liberty or property interest in discretionary relief. <i>See Torres,</i> 383 F.3d at 103 (\"[B]ecause discretionary relief is necessarily a matter of grace rather than of right, aliens do not have a due process liberty interest in consideration for such relief.\"); <i>Wilson,</i> 316 F.3d at 510 (\"[S]ection 212(c) does not create an entitlement, but is rather completely discretionary in nature.\"); <i>Lopez-Ortiz,</i> 313 F.3d at 230 (\"Because eligibility for &#167; 212(c) relief is not a liberty or property interest warranting due process protection, we hold that the Immigration Judge's error in failing to explain Lopez-Ortiz's eligibility does not rise to the level of fundamental unfairness.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second and Ninth Circuits have taken a different approach.

They conclude, therefore, that an agency's failure to adequately inform an immigrant of his or her eligibility for &#167; 212(c) relief, if prejudicial, can render the deportation fundamentally unfair. <i>See Copeland,</i> 376 F.3d at 72 (\"The decisions holding that a failure to inform an alien about Section 212(c) relief cannot be a fundamental error collapse [the] distinction [between a right to seek relief and the right to that relief itself]....

The court concluded that Luna failed to establish prejudice, noting that \"[a]lthough Defendant recites several factors he believes support his application for section 212(c) relief, he falls short of convincing this Court that those favorable factors outweigh the adverse ones, especially Defendant's violent criminal history.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preliminary matter, we note that Luna's first deportation order and reentry should not factor into the prejudice analysis, given the agency's recognition of the \"serious errors\" made in his first deportation proceedings. The IJ in Luna's second deportation hearing was so troubled by the errors that he did not consider the first deportation hearing and reentry as grounds for deportation. Given this determination, it is unlikely that the IJ would have considered that reentry in an adjudication of Luna's &#167; 212(c) application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Putting aside that factor, however, we nonetheless agree with the district court's conclusion. Luna has a serious criminal history, including numerous offenses and a violent crime against a child. Although he asserts that he has had the opportunity to rehabilitate himself, he fails to specify any evidence of rehabilitation or good character. Luna lacks a history of steady employment and points to no evidence of positive contributions to society. Furthermore, although Luna's parents and siblings are in this country, Luna fails to describe his relationship with them and the extent of the hardship that they will face if he is deported. We have carefully considered the favorable equities that Luna does assert, particularly his lengthy residency here since infancy. However, on the balance, we conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the agency would have granted a waiver in his case. While none of the aforementioned factors, taken alone, would necessarily doom Luna's application, we conclude that his lengthy criminal history, the violent nature of his criminal activity, and the relative lack of positive equities eliminate any reasonable likelihood that he would have received a grant of relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Luna has failed to demonstrate prejudice under &#167; 1326(d), the district court properly denied his motion to dismiss the indictment for illegal reentry.
