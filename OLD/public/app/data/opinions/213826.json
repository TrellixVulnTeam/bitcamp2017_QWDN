José A. Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                   Torruella, Lipez, and Thompson,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Raymond L.

Meconiates, Assistant United States Attorney, were on\nbrief for appellee.\n\fApril 1, 2011\n\n\n\n\n     -2-\n\f          TORRUELLA,      Circuit    Judge.       Alexis   Alverio-Meléndez\n\n(\"Alverio\")   and    Armando   Gómez-Ortiz    (\"Gómez\")     challenge   their\n\nconvictions for (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute\n\ncocaine and (2) aiding and abetting in the possession of a firearm\n\nin furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.          Gómez argues that the\n\nevidence was insufficient to convict him on either count; Alverio\n\nchallenges the sufficiency of the evidence against him on the\n\nfirearm count.      Gómez also contends that the government committed\n\na Brady violation, and both defendants argue that the district\n\ncourt erred in instructing the jury as to the firearm count.             For\n\nthe reasons below, we affirm both convictions.\n\n                               I.   Background1\n\n          Rafael       Rodríguez-Morales      (\"Rodríguez\"),       a    paid\n\nconfidential informant and one of the government's key witnesses at\n\ntrial, first met Alverio in approximately 2004.            At that time, one\n\nof Rodríguez's co-workers set up a meeting between Rodríguez and\n\nAlverio because the co-worker wanted Rodríguez to re-enter the drug\n\ntrafficking business.     Gómez also attended the meeting, which was\n\nat Rodríguez's mother's house.        Rodríguez did not find out Gómez's\n\nreal name at that meeting, but learned that his nickname was\n\n\"Flaco\" or \"El Flaco\" (i.e., \"the skinny one\").                  During the\n\n\n\n1\n   We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict\nbecause the defendants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence.\nSee United States v. García-Álvarez, 541 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir.\n2008).\n\n                                     -3-\n\fmeeting, Gómez spoke to Rodríguez about cocaine prices.            Alverio\n\nsaid nothing about prices and instead, according to Rodríguez's\n\ntestimony at trial, \"look[ed] at El Flaco, the one that would\n\ndictate the drug prices.\"\n\n            Approximately one and a half years later, Alverio started\n\ncalling Rodríguez and offering to sell him cocaine. Rodríguez, who\n\nwas by then an informant for the DEA, contacted the DEA but did not\n\nreceive authorization to proceed with a drug transaction.\n\n            In January 2009, Alverio again called Rodríguez.           This\n\ntime, the DEA authorized Rodríguez to proceed and worked with him\n\nto   record   two   conversations   between    him    and   Alverio.    On\n\nJanuary 29, 2009, Alverio said, among other things, that he would\n\ncontact Rodríguez as soon as he had drugs.           On February 4, 2009,\n\nRodríguez spoke to Alverio about purchasing six \"eighths\" (i.e.,\n\neighths of a kilogram) of cocaine.        The two men agreed to meet at\n\nten o'clock the next day.      Alverio said he was going to call a\n\nfriend in order for the friend to give him the cocaine.          Rodríguez\n\nasked if \"the man,\" or the owner of the drugs, could reduce the\n\nprice by one or two hundred dollars.        Later in the conversation,\n\nRodríguez asked Alverio if the drugs belonged to the skinny man to\n\nwhom Alverio had introduced Rodríguez, and Alverio responded that\n\nthey did.\n\n            On February 5, 2009, Rodríguez called Alverio to confirm\n\nthat they were ready for the drug transaction.               When Alverio\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\farrived at the K-Mart in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, the appointed\n\nmeeting place, he called Rodríguez, who was inside the store at\n\nthat point.     Alverio guided Rodríguez to the spot where his car was\n\nparked,   and   Rodríguez   noticed    that   there   was   another   man   in\n\nAlverio's car.     When Rodríguez asked Alverio if the second man was\n\n\"El Flaco,\" Alverio said that he was.             Alverio also said, in\n\nresponse to a question from Rodríguez, that the other man was the\n\nowner of the drugs.\n\n           When the time came to verify the drugs, Alverio asked\n\nRodríguez if they could move to Rodríguez's car. Rodríguez replied\n\nthat his car was far away and asked to verify the drugs in\n\nAlverio's car.     Alverio said that the other man in the car did not\n\nwant Rodríguez to verify the drugs in the car.               When Rodríguez\n\nasked again if the second man was the owner of the drugs, Alverio\n\nreplied affirmatively.       Before visually verifying the drugs in\n\nAlverio's car, Rodríguez attempted to say hello to Gómez.             Several\n\nseconds passed before Gómez responded, but when Rodríguez asked\n\nGómez if Gómez remembered him, Gómez said that he did.            According\n\nto Rodríguez's testimony at trial, Gómez was sitting sideways in\n\nthe passenger seat of the car with his right hand near his thigh,\n\ngiving Rodríguez the impression that there was a firearm in the\n\ncar.\n\n           After greeting Gómez, Rodríguez opened a small package,\n\nwhich Alverio had placed in the middle of the car's rear seat, that\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\flooked like a child's lunch box. The substance inside smelled like\n\ncocaine.   Rodríguez then said that the air seemed charged and\n\nsuggested that they move to another location, Monte Brisas.     The\n\ndefendants agreed that they should go to Monte Brisas and proceeded\n\nto pull away.   Rodríguez, who had one leg inside the car and the\n\nother outside, was able to get out before the car departed.    Once\n\nout of the car, Rodríguez reported to a DEA official that he felt\n\nhis life was in danger because there were firearms in the car, and\n\nsaid that the defendants took the cocaine away in their vehicle.\n\n           As the defendants drove toward Monte Brisas, they were\n\nstopped by a marked police vehicle.       DEA Special Agent Jimmy\n\nAlverio (\"Agent Alverio\"), who had been conducting surveillance in\n\nthe K-Mart parking lot and who had followed the defendants toward\n\nMonte Brisas, assisted.   From the driver's side of the car, Agent\n\nAlverio noticed a gun with an extended magazine in the passenger\n\ndoor \"pocket.\" A firearm examiner later tested the weapon, a Glock\n\n.40 caliber pistol, and discovered that it was capable of firing\n\nautomatically. Agent Alverio also saw, and later opened, the lunch\n\nbox in the back seat, which a chemist subsequently determined\n\ncontained just under three-fourths of a kilogram of 70.7% pure\n\ncocaine.\n\n           When law enforcement officers arrested Gómez and Alverio,\n\nthey seized a green fanny pack that Gómez was wearing.    The fanny\n\npack contained, among other things, three .40 caliber bullets, a\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fmagazine that contained fifteen .40 caliber bullets, a slide back\n\ncover for a Glock, a drug ledger, and nine vials of crack cocaine.\n\nOfficers also seized cellular phones from Alverio and Gómez and\n\nlearned the number of the phone that Gómez was carrying.2                              By\n\nanalyzing toll records, DEA Agent Álvaro Agreló learned that on at\n\nleast   two    occasions,          immediately     after     Rodríguez       spoke   with\n\nAlverio, Alverio's phone was used to dial the phone that Gómez had\n\nwith him on the day of the arrest.\n\n                                    II.    Discussion\n\n              A.    The Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n              We review de novo whether the evidence presented at trial\n\nis sufficient to support a conviction.                  United States v. Rosado-\n\nPérez, 605 F.3d 48, 52 (1st Cir. 2010).                    In doing so, \"[w]e take\n\nthe evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most\n\nfavorable to the prosecution.\"                    Id.   We will affirm \"[i]f a\n\nreasonable         jury    could    find   the     defendants       guilty    beyond    a\n\nreasonable doubt of all elements of the charged offense.\"                        Id.\n\n                          1.   Gómez's Drug Conviction\n\n              Gómez       argues   that    the    evidence    was    insufficient      to\n\nsupport his conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to\n\ndistribute cocaine. Gómez notes that Alverio, not he, spoke to and\n\nnegotiated with Rodríguez, and that he was never seen handling the\n\n\n\n2\n   They were already aware of the number of the phone that Alverio\nused because Alverio had called Rodríguez on that phone.\n\n                                            -7-\n\fdrugs. In addition, Gómez contends that because the government did\n\nnot perform any fingerprint analysis on the lunch box containing\n\nthe drugs, it is unclear whether or not he owned the drugs.\n\nFurthermore, Gómez points out that no government agent could\n\ncorroborate Rodríguez's testimony that Alverio identified Gómez as\n\nthe owner of the drugs on the day of the arrest.             Gómez suggests\n\nthat Rodríguez's testimony alone is insufficient to sustain his\n\nconviction because Rodríguez, who has been convicted of homicide\n\nand various other crimes, is not a credible witness.\n\n           In order to sustain a conviction for conspiracy under 21\n\nU.S.C. § 846, the evidence must show that (1) a conspiracy existed,\n\n(2) the defendant had knowledge of the conspiracy, and (3) the\n\ndefendant knowingly and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy.\n\nUnited States v. Pomales-Lebrón, 513 F.3d 262, 267 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\nTo prove the underlying offense of possession with intent to\n\ndistribute,   see   21   U.S.C.   §    841(a)(1),    the   government   must\n\nestablish that a defendant \"knowingly and intentionally possessed,\n\neither actually or constructively, a controlled substance with the\n\nspecific   intent   to   distribute.\"       United    States    v.   García-\n\nCarrasquillo, 483 F.3d 124, 130 (1st Cir. 2007).           In light of these\n\nstandards, we conclude that the government presented sufficient\n\nevidence for a rational trier of fact to find Gómez guilty.\n\n           The government provided abundant evidence that Gómez\n\nprovided the drugs for the transaction and was not merely an\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\funlucky bystander.     First, Rodríguez testified at trial that Gómez\n\nwas present when he first met with Alverio at his mother's house to\n\ndiscuss   re-entering   the   drug   business,    and   that   Gómez,    whom\n\nRodríguez knew as \"El Flaco,\" was the person who told him about\n\nprices    while   Alverio   looked   on    silently.    In   addition,    the\n\ngovernment played a recording of a conversation between Alverio and\n\nRodríguez from February 4, 2009, during which Rodríguez asked if\n\nthe drugs he was going to buy belonged to \"the skinny guy\" whom he\n\nhad met at his mother's house, and Alverio responded affirmatively.\n\n            Furthermore, toll records showed that after Alverio spoke\n\nwith Rodríguez on February 4, the same phone that Alverio had used\n\nto speak with Rodríguez was used to dial a cell phone number that\n\ncorresponded to the cell phone that Gómez had on the day of the\n\narrest.    Given Alverio's comment during the recorded phone call\n\nthat he was going to call the friend who had the cocaine, the fact\n\nthat his phone was used to call Gómez's phone provides particularly\n\nstrong support for the conclusion that Gómez was the source of the\n\ndrugs.    A second phone call from Alverio's phone to Gómez's phone,\n\nplaced immediately after Rodríguez called Alverio on the morning of\n\nFebruary 5th, also supports the government's theory.3\n\n\n3\n   Gómez argues that Agent Agreló's testimony explaining the toll\nrecords was impermissible \"overview\" testimony and should not be\nconsidered when analyzing whether the evidence was sufficient to\nsupport the verdict. This argument, which Gómez presents in one\nsentence in his brief, has been waived because it has not been\nsufficiently developed. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1,\n17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                     -9-\n\f             In addition, Rodríguez testified at trial that Alverio\n\nsaid on the day of the drug transaction that the man with him in\n\nthe car was the owner of the drugs.          Rodríguez also noted that\n\nGómez, after some delay, acknowledged that he remembered Rodríguez,\n\nwhich supports the government's theory that the man in the car was\n\nthe same man that Rodríguez met initially at his mother's house.\n\n             Moreover, the very fact that Gómez was in the car when\n\nthe   drug    transaction   took   place    provides   support   for   the\n\ngovernment's theory that he was a coconspirator.        As Agent Alverio\n\ntestified, it is not common for drug traffickers to bring innocent\n\npeople to drug transactions. Of course, however, \"mere presence at\n\nthe scene of conspiracy activities or simple association with\n\nconspirators     is   not   enough,    standing   alone,   to    establish\n\nparticipation in a conspiracy.\"        United States v. Rodríguez-Ortiz,\n\n455 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n             Finally, Gómez's argument that the evidence against him\n\nwas insufficient because Rodríguez was not a credible witness is\n\nmeritless. \"It is not for us to make credibility determinations in\n\nthe course of a review of the sufficiency of the evidence.\"        United\n\nStates v. Morales-Machuca, 546 F.3d 13, 21 (1st Cir. 2008).            \"A\n\nconviction may be based solely on the uncorroborated testimony of\n\na confidential informant so long as the testimony is not incredible\n\nor insubstantial on its face.\"        United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez,\n\n219 F.3d 37, 46 (1st Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fHere, Rodríguez's testimony is not \"incredible or insubstantial on\n\nits face,\" nor is it entirely uncorroborated.              Toll records and\n\nrecordings of phone conversations support his version of events.\n\n          For all these reasons, the evidence was sufficient to\n\nenable a rational factfinder to convict Gómez on the drug count.\n\n                  2.   Gómez's Firearm Conviction\n\n          Gómez   argues   that   the     evidence   was   insufficient   to\n\nsupport his firearm conviction. In order to convict a defendant of\n\npossessing a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking\n\ncrime under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), \"the government must prove\n\nthat the defendant[] 1) committed a drug trafficking crime; 2)\n\nknowingly possessed a firearm; and 3) possessed the firearm in\n\nfurtherance of the drug trafficking crime.\" United States v. Pena,\n\n586 F.3d 105, 112 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n          As discussed above, there was sufficient evidence here to\n\nsupport the conclusion that Gómez committed a drug trafficking\n\ncrime.   In addition, the government presented sufficient evidence\n\nthat Gómez knowingly possessed a firearm.        Agent Alverio testified\n\nat trial that he saw a handgun in the \"pocket\" of the front\n\npassenger door when the defendants were arrested, and that Gómez\n\nwas in the passenger's seat.      Another government witness testified\n\nthat the fanny pack that Gómez was wearing when he was arrested\n\ncontained three .40 caliber bullets and a magazine containing\n\nfifteen more .40 caliber bullets, both of which could be used to\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\ffire the gun, a Glock .40 caliber pistol, as well as a slide back\n\ncover that \"is the rear part of the Glock.\"                Finally, Rodríguez\n\ntestified at trial that he thought Gómez had a gun based on the way\n\nthat Gómez was positioned.           This evidence was sufficient for a\n\nrational finder of fact to determine that Gómez knowingly possessed\n\nthe firearm.\n\n             Finally, as discussed in the following section, the\n\nevidence     was   sufficient   to    support      the   conclusion   that    the\n\npossession was in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime. Thus,\n\nwe will not disturb the verdict on Gómez's firearm count.\n\n                     3.   Alverio's Firearm Conviction\n\n             Citing 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), Alverio argues that the\n\ngovernment had to prove that he \"1) committed a drug trafficking\n\ncrime; 2) knowingly possessed a firearm; and 3) possessed the\n\nfirearm in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime.\"                He insists\n\nthat the \"evidence was insufficient to convince a rational jury\n\nbeyond   a   reasonable   doubt      that   [he]   possessed   the    Glock   'in\n\nfurtherance of' a drug trafficking crime.\"                  He was indicted,\n\nhowever, for aiding and abetting in the possession of a firearm in\n\nfurtherance of a drug trafficking offense, which requires proof\n\nthat he knew to a practical certainty that Gómez would possess the\n\ngun in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime and that he took\n\nsome step to facilitate the possession.             See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Medina-Román, 376 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004).              Consequently, we\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fneed only consider that part of his argument that also applies to\n\nan aiding-and-abetting conviction -- namely, his claim that the\n\nevidence was insufficient to sustain his firearm conviction because\n\nthe government failed to show that the possession of the firearm\n\nwas in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.     To support this\n\ncontention, Alverio points to Rodríguez's testimony at trial that\n\nAlverio specifically told Rodríguez he did not want Rodríguez to\n\nverify the drugs in his vehicle, that Alverio said Gómez did not\n\nwant the transaction to take place in Alverio's car, and that\n\nAlverio proposed that they go to Rodríguez's car instead.    If the\n\ngun had been possessed in furtherance of the drug trafficking\n\ncrime, Alverio claims, Alverio and Gómez would not have wanted\n\nRodríguez to verify the drugs in his own car.\n\n          Alverio's argument is meritless because a gun need not be\n\npresent at the moment that drugs are verified, or at the moment\n\nthat money or drugs change hands, in order to be possessed in\n\nfurtherance of a drug trafficking crime.    Possession of a firearm\n\n\"to protect drugs or sales proceeds\" can constitute possession in\n\nfurtherance of a drug trafficking crime.    United States v. Marin,\n\n523 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2008).   Here, a rational factfinder could\n\nconclude that Gómez had the gun to protect the cocaine on the way\n\nto the transaction and the money that the defendants expected to\n\nreceive -- $3,300 for each of the six \"eighths\" -- on the way back\n\nfrom the transaction.   The evidence would have been sufficient to\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fsupport the conclusion that the gun was possessed in furtherance of\n\nthe drug trafficking crime regardless of where the transaction\n\noccurred.    Thus, we will not overturn the verdict on Alverio's gun\n\ncount.\n\n            B.    The Jury Instructions\n\n            Having concluded that the evidence was sufficient to\n\nsupport both defendants' convictions, we must separately address\n\nthe claim of instructional error.             See United States v. Baldyga,\n\n233 F.3d 674, 682 n.8 (1st Cir. 2000) (noting that a court could\n\nconsistently conclude both that the evidence was sufficient to\n\nsupport a verdict and that the jury instructions constituted\n\nreversible error because of the different legal standards governing\n\nthe two claims).\n\n            The     defendants    contend     that    the   district    court's\n\ninstructions on the firearm count were flawed in three ways.\n\nFirst, the court erred by instructing the jury on the meaning of\n\n\"us[ing] or carr[ying]\" a firearm \"during and in relation to\" a\n\ndrug   trafficking      crime,    18   U.S.C.   §    924(c)(1)(A),     when   the\n\ndefendants       were   charged   with    \"possess[ing]     a   firearm\"      \"in\n\nfurtherance of\" a drug trafficking crime, id.               Second, the court\n\nfailed to instruct the jury that the mere presence of a firearm in\n\nthe area where a drug trafficking offense occurs is insufficient to\n\nfind a defendant guilty of possessing a firearm in furtherance of\n\na drug trafficking crime.         Finally, the defendants allege that the\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fcourt improperly coached the jury by incorporating details that\n\nmirrored those of their own case into the jury instructions.\n\n           We review challenges to jury instructions for plain error\n\nwhere, as here, the defendants failed to object at trial.        United\n\nStates v. Riccio, 529 F.3d 40, 46 (1st Cir. 2008).       Thus, we will\n\nnot disturb the convictions unless the defendants can prove \"(1)\n\nthat an error occurred; (2) that the error was clear or obvious;\n\n(3) that the error affected [their] substantial rights; and (4)\n\nthat the error also seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.\"          United States v.\n\nGonzalez, 570 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); see also United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732\n\n(1993).4    \"[P]lain   error   review   tends   to   afford   relief   to\n\nappellants only for 'blockbuster[]' errors.\"          United States v.\n\nMoran, 393 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting United States v.\n\nGriffin, 818 F.2d 97, 100 (1st Cir. 1987)); see also United States\n\nv. Gomez, 255 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"[T]he plain-error\n\n\n\n\n4\n   The government raises the possibility that the district court\nmight have constructively amended the indictment when it instructed\nthe jury on using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to\na drug trafficking crime. We need not address this issue. Even if\nthe district court did constructively amend the indictment, the\ndefendants must still prove that prejudice resulted. See United\nStates v. Brandao, 539 F.3d 44, 62 (1st Cir. 2008) (holding that a\ndefendant who alleges constructive amendment of an indictment \"must\nmake the required showing of prejudice under Olano and its\nprogeny\"). For the reasons discussed below, they cannot do so.\n\n                                 -15-\n\fexception is cold comfort to most defendants pursuing claims of\n\ninstructional error.\").\n\n                  1.   Background\n\n          The   district   court    gave   the   following   instructions\n\nregarding the firearm count, referring throughout to the language\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) that addresses using and carrying a\n\nfirearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime:\n\n                  The defendants are accused of using or\n          carrying a firearm during and in relation to a\n          drug trafficking crime. Basically, what that\n          means is that while they conspired to commit\n          the offence of possessing with intent to\n          distribute, they at the same time used or\n          carried a firearm.\n          . . . .\n                  . . . You have to figure out from the\n          evidence you received here whether indeed\n          there was a gun here to begin with; and,\n          number two, whether this gun was possessed,\n          used, carried during the commission of a drug\n          trafficking offence.\n                  So the following things have to be\n          proven. First, that the defendant that you're\n          considering    indeed   committed   the   first\n          offence, the possession, the conspiracy to\n          possess with intent to distribute narcotics,\n          cocaine in this case.\n                  Number two, that during and in relation\n          to the commission of that crime, that\n          particular defendant knowingly used or carried\n          a firearm. . . .\n                  To carry a firearm means -- or to carry\n          a firearm during and in relation to a drug\n          trafficking crime means to move or transport\n          the firearm on one's person or in a vehicle or\n          in a container during and in relation to the\n          crime.    The firearm need not be immediately\n          accessible.\n                  To use a firearm during and in relation\n          to a crime of this kind means to employ the\n          firearm    actively,   such   as   brandishing,\n\n                                   -16-\n\f            displaying it, striking it, attempting to fire\n            it. In this case it's basically carrying it.\n                   The firearm must have played some sort\n            of important role in the commission of the\n            offense, must have been intended by the\n            defendant to play an important role in the\n            commission of the offence. And the role could\n            have been protection, the role could have been\n            security, whatever it may be. Okay.\n\nNeither defendant objected to these instructions.\n\n                   2.    Analysis\n\n            The government does not contest that the district court\n\nerred by instructing the jury regarding \"us[ing] or carr[ying]\" a\n\nfirearm \"during and in relation to\" a drug trafficking crime rather\n\nthan instructing it on \"possess[ing] a firearm\" \"in furtherance of\"\n\na   drug   trafficking    crime.     18    U.S.C.   §    924(c)(1)(A).        The\n\ngovernment    argues,    however,   and    we   agree,   that   there   was    no\n\nreversible error here.\n\n            Instructing the jury regarding \"use and carry\" instead of\n\n\"possession\" was not reversible error because \"use and carry\"\n\nnecessarily includes possession.          A person cannot \"use\" a firearm\n\nwithout possessing it.      See Pena, 586 F.3d at 114 (\"[E]ven if the\n\njury thought it had to find 'use[]' [instead of 'possession,'] that\n\nwould have been a benefit not a detriment to [the defendant].\").\n\nOne also cannot \"carry\" a firearm without possessing it.                      See\n\nUnited States v. Gill, 513 F.3d 836, 851 (8th Cir. 2008).\n\n            In addition, the instructions on \"use\" of a firearm\n\n\"during and in relation to\" a drug trafficking crime did not\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fconstitute reversible error. \"[W]e have understood 'in furtherance\n\nof' to demand showing a sufficient nexus between the firearm and\n\nthe drug crime such that the firearm advances or promotes the drug\n\ncrime.   For example, we have held that possession of a firearm to\n\nprotect drugs or sales proceeds can establish such a nexus.\"\n\nMarin, 523 F.3d at 27 (internal citations omitted).               Here, the\n\ncourt noted that \"the firearm must have played some sort of\n\nimportant role in the commission of the offense, must have been\n\nintended   by   the   defendant   to   play   an   important   role   in   the\n\ncommission of the offence,\" and specifically gave the example cited\n\nin Marin, see id., when explaining that \"the role could have been\n\nprotection, the role could have been security, whatever it may be.\"\n\n           This circuit has noted before that \"the 'in furtherance\n\nof' element of a firearm possession charge imposes a 'slightly\n\nhigher standard' of liability than the nexus element corresponding\n\nto the different charges of using or carrying a firearm, which need\n\nonly occur 'during and in relation to' the underlying crime.\"\n\nUnited States v. Delgado-Hernandez, 420 F.3d 16, 25 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(quoting H.R. Rep. No. 105-344, at 11 (1997)).                  We are not\n\nsuggesting otherwise here.        We cannot see, however, how the jury\n\ncould have concluded that the firearm here played an important role\n\nin the commission of the offense without concluding that the weapon\n\nmet the \"in furtherance of\" requirement. Thus, reviewing for plain\n\nerror, we will not overturn the jury's verdict.\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f           In light of the jury instructions described above, in\n\nconvicting the defendants on the firearm charges, the jury must\n\nhave concluded that the weapon was not merely present at the scene,\n\nbut that it played an important role in the commission of the\n\noffense.    Thus, we reject the claim that the district court's\n\nfailure    to   give   a   \"mere   presence\"   instruction   constituted\n\nreversible error.\n\n           Finally, we reject the defendants' coaching argument.\n\nThe defendants contend that the district court improperly coached\n\nthe jury when it explained that \"to carry a firearm during and in\n\nrelation to a drug trafficking crime means to move or transport the\n\nfirearm on one's person or in a vehicle or in a container during\n\nand in relation to the crime.\"      That this very language is part of\n\nthe First Circuit's pattern jury instructions emphasizes that,\n\nrather than coaching, the district court was merely explaining in\n\ngeneral terms the charge against the defendants.             See Pattern\n\nCriminal Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the First\n\nCircuit § 4.07 (1998).5        The defendants also allege that the\n\ndistrict court improperly coached the jury when it instructed that\n\nthe firearm \"must have played some sort of important role in the\n\ncommission of the offense\" and noted that \"the role could have been\n\n\n\n5\n  As we have noted previously, \"although pattern instructions are\noften helpful, their use is precatory, not mandatory.\"     United\nStates v. Jadlowe, 628 F.3d 1, 17 n.29 (1st Cir. 2010) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n                                   -19-\n\fprotection, . . . security,\" or some other role.               This guidance\n\ndoes   not    constitute   coaching    either.      See   United   States   v.\n\nHernández, 490 F.3d 81, 84 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"It is unquestioned\n\nthat, when instructing a jury, a judge 'may explain, comment upon\n\nand incorporate the evidence into the instructions in order to\n\nassist the jury to understand it in light of the applicable legal\n\nprinciples.'\" (quoting United States v. Maguire, 918 F.2d 254, 268\n\n(1st Cir. 1990))).\n\n             C.   The Brady Claim\n\n             Gómez   argues   that   the     government   committed   a   Brady\n\nviolation by failing to provide a fingerprint analysis of the\n\nweapon found in Alverio's car.        See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83\n\n(1963).      The government responds that no fingerprint analysis was\n\never performed, and thus there cannot have been a Brady violation.6\n\n             \"Review of the district court's decision to deny a\n\ndefendant's motion for a new trial on the basis of alleged Brady\n\nviolations is for manifest abuse of discretion.\"            United States v.\n\nBrandao, 539 F.3d 44, 64 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n\n\n\n6\n   The government also contends that the district court properly\ndenied the defendant's motion under Federal Rule of Criminal\nProcedure 33 for a new trial because the motion was untimely.\nBecause we resolve this issue on the merits and in favor of the\ngovernment, we need not address the timeliness argument.\n\n                                      -20-\n\f                    1.   Background\n\n            At trial, during cross-examination by Gómez's attorney,\n\nAgent Agreló testified as follows regarding fingerprints on the\n\nweapon:\n\n            Q.      Any fingerprints were taken from the\n                    pistol?\n            A.      A step was taken to take fingerprints\n                    of the evidence.\n            Q.      Were any fingerprints taken?\n            A.      No.   Steps were taken, but they were\n                    not able to do the analysis.\n            Q.      I didn't hear your answer, sir.\n            A.      They were not done.     They were not\n                    performed, sir.\n            Q.      You do have the equipment to do that\n                    job; is that correct?\n            A.      Our lab, yes, sir.\n            Q.      You didn't feel it necessary to take\n                    the fingerprints?\n            A.      Like I said before, yes, sir, I\n                    requested the test for the lab.\n\nAfter hearing this testimony, neither defense attorney requested a\n\ncontinuance in order to obtain a fingerprint analysis report for\n\nthe weapon.      The Brady issue did not arise until more than ten\n\nmonths later, when Gómez's attorney filed an emergency motion\n\nrequesting a new trial.     The motion noted that, according to Agent\n\nAgreló's testimony,      fingerprinting tests of the gun were ordered\n\nbut never performed, and argued that the results of such tests were\n\nexculpatory evidence and should have been disclosed pursuant to\n\nBrady.    The district court denied this motion.        Gómez now appeals\n\nthe   district    court's   determination   that   no    Brady   violation\n\noccurred.\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\f            At   oral    argument,        we   questioned    counsel       for   the\n\ngovernment about the possibility that a fingerprint analysis report\n\nexisted. Counsel explained that she had never received notice from\n\nthe government lab confirming that a fingerprint analysis report\n\nhad not been completed, but that she also had never received any\n\nsuch report.     Because the government \"'has a duty to learn of any\n\nfavorable evidence known to the others acting on the government's\n\nbehalf,'\" Moreno-Morales v. United States, 334 F.3d 140, 146 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (quoting Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 437 (1995)), we\n\nrequested   that   counsel      for   the      government    submit    a    proffer\n\nregarding   whether      or   not   the   government   lab    ever    produced    a\n\nfingerprint analysis report on the machine gun.                       The proffer\n\nconfirmed that no fingerprint analysis was ever conducted; the\n\nfirearm was only examined for \"operability.\"\n\n                    2.    Analysis\n\n            To establish a Brady violation, \"a defendant must make\n\nthree showings.     'The evidence at issue (whether exculpatory or\n\nimpeaching) must be favorable to the accused; that evidence must\n\nhave been either willfully or inadvertently suppressed by the\n\ngovernment; and prejudice must have ensued.'\"                 United States v.\n\nMathur, 624 F.3d 498, 503 (1st Cir. 2010) (quoting United States v.\n\nConnolly, 504 F.3d 206, 212 (1st Cir. 2007)).               \"Although it hardly\n\nbears mention, an implicit prerequisite of any Brady claim is that\n\nfavorable, material evidence actually exists.\"                United States v.\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fGarvin, 270 F. App'x 141, 144 (3d Cir. 2008).           Here, because no\n\nfingerprint analysis report existed, the government did not commit\n\na Brady violation in failing to turn over such a report.              The\n\nfailure to create exculpatory evidence does not constitute a Brady\n\nviolation.     See Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51, 59 (1988)\n\n(\"[T]he police do not have a constitutional duty to perform any\n\nparticular tests.\"); see also United States v. Nguyen, 98 F. App'x\n\n608, 609 (9th Cir. 2004) (\"Brady does not require the government to\n\ninterview witnesses or otherwise create exculpatory evidence not\n\nthen in existence.\" (citing United States v. Monroe, 943 F.2d 1007,\n\n1011 n.2 (9th Cir. 1991))).\n\n                           III.   Conclusion\n\n          For   the   reasons   stated,   we   affirm   both   defendants'\n\nconvictions.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\f",

Meconiates, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, LIPEZ, and THOMPSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Alexis Alverio-Meléndez (\"Alverio\") and Armando Gómez-Ortiz (\"Gómez\") challenge their convictions for (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and (2) aiding and abetting in the possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. Gómez argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him on either count; Alverio challenges the sufficiency of the evidence against him on the firearm count. Gómez also contends that the government committed a <i>Brady</i> violation, and both defendants argue that the district court erred in instructing the jury as to the firearm count. For the reasons below, we affirm both convictions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i><sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p>Rafael Rodríguez-Morales (\"Rodríguez\"), a paid confidential informant and one of the government's key witnesses at trial, first met Alverio in approximately 2004. At that time, one of Rodríguez's co-workers set up a meeting between Rodríguez and Alverio because the co-worker wanted Rodríguez to re-enter the drug trafficking business. Gómez also attended the meeting, which was at Rodríguez's mother's house. Rodríguez did not find out Gómez's real name at that meeting, but learned that his nickname was \"Flaco\" or \"El Flaco\" (i.e., \"the skinny one\"). During the meeting, Gómez spoke to Rodríguez about cocaine prices. Alverio said nothing about prices and instead, according to Rodríguez's testimony at trial, \"look[ed] at El Flaco, the one that would dictate the drug prices.\"</p>\n<p>Approximately one and a half years later, Alverio started calling Rodríguez and offering to sell him cocaine. Rodríguez, who was by then an informant for the DEA, contacted the DEA but did not receive authorization to proceed with a drug transaction.</p>\n<p>In January 2009, Alverio again called Rodríguez. This time, the DEA authorized Rodríguez to proceed and worked with him to record two conversations between him and Alverio. On January 29, 2009, Alverio said, among other things, that he would contact Rodríguez as soon as he had drugs. On February 4, 2009, Rodríguez spoke to Alverio about purchasing six \"eighths\" (i.e., eighths of a kilogram) of cocaine. The two men agreed to meet at ten o'clock the next day. Alverio said he was going to call a friend in order for the friend to give him the cocaine. Rodríguez asked if \"the man,\" or the owner of the drugs, could reduce the price by one or two hundred dollars. Later in the conversation, Rodríguez asked Alverio if the drugs belonged to the skinny man to whom Alverio had introduced Rodríguez, and Alverio responded that they did.</p>\n<p>On February 5, 2009, Rodríguez called Alverio to confirm that they were ready for the drug transaction. When Alverio arrived at the K-Mart in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, the appointed meeting place, he called Rodríguez, who was inside the store at that point. Alverio guided Rodríguez to the spot where his car was parked, and Rodríguez noticed that there was another man in Alverio's car. When Rodríguez asked Alverio if the second man was \"El Flaco,\" Alverio said that he was. Alverio <span class=\"star-pagination\">*417</span> also said, in response to a question from Rodríguez, that the other man was the owner of the drugs.</p>\n<p>When the time came to verify the drugs, Alverio asked Rodríguez if they could move to Rodríguez's car. Rodríguez replied that his car was far away and asked to verify the drugs in Alverio's car. Alverio said that the other man in the car did not want Rodríguez to verify the drugs in the car. When Rodríguez asked again if the second man was the owner of the drugs, Alverio replied affirmatively. Before visually verifying the drugs in Alverio's car, Rodríguez attempted to say hello to Gómez. Several seconds passed before Gómez responded, but when Rodríguez asked Gómez if Gómez remembered him, Gómez said that he did. According to Rodríguez's testimony at trial, Gómez was sitting sideways in the passenger seat of the car with his right hand near his thigh, giving Rodríguez the impression that there was a firearm in the car.</p>\n<p>After greeting Gómez, Rodríguez opened a small package, which Alverio had placed in the middle of the car's rear seat, that looked like a child's lunch box. The substance inside smelled like cocaine. Rodríguez then said that the air seemed charged and suggested that they move to another location, Monte Brisas. The defendants agreed that they should go to Monte Brisas and proceeded to pull away. Rodríguez, who had one leg inside the car and the other outside, was able to get out before the car departed. Once out of the car, Rodríguez reported to a DEA official that he felt his life was in danger because there were firearms in the car, and said that the defendants took the cocaine away in their vehicle.</p>\n<p>As the defendants drove toward Monte Brisas, they were stopped by a marked police vehicle. DEA Special Agent Jimmy Alverio (\"Agent Alverio\"), who had been conducting surveillance in the K-Mart parking lot and who had followed the defendants toward Monte Brisas, assisted. From the driver's side of the car, Agent Alverio noticed a gun with an extended magazine in the passenger door \"pocket.\" A firearm examiner later tested the weapon, a Glock .40 caliber pistol, and discovered that it was capable of firing automatically. Agent Alverio also saw, and later opened, the lunch box in the back seat, which a chemist subsequently determined contained just under three-fourths of a kilogram of 70.7% pure cocaine.</p>\n<p>When law enforcement officers arrested Gómez and Alverio, they seized a green fanny pack that Gómez was wearing. The fanny pack contained, among other things, three .40 caliber bullets, a magazine that contained fifteen .40 caliber bullets, a slide back cover for a Glock, a drug ledger, and nine vials of crack cocaine. Officers also seized cellular phones from Alverio and Gómez and learned the number of the phone that Gómez was carrying.<sup>[2]</sup> By analyzing toll records, DEA Agent Álvaro Agreló learned that on at least two occasions, immediately after Rodríguez spoke with Alverio, Alverio's phone was used to dial the phone that Gómez had with him on the day of the arrest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Sufficiency of the Evidence</h2>\n<p>We review <i>de novo</i> whether the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to support a conviction. <i>United States v. Rosado-Pérez,</i> 605 F.3d 48, 52 (1st Cir.2010). In doing so, \"[w]e take the evidence and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*418</span> draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the prosecution.\" <i>Id.</i> We will affirm \"[i]f a reasonable jury could find the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of all elements of the charged offense.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Gómez's Drug Conviction</h2>\n<p>Gómez argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine. Gómez notes that Alverio, not he, spoke to and negotiated with Rodríguez, and that he was never seen handling the drugs. In addition, Gómez contends that because the government did not perform any fingerprint analysis on the lunch box containing the drugs, it is unclear whether or not he owned the drugs. Furthermore, Gómez points out that no government agent could corroborate Rodríguez's testimony that Alverio identified Gómez as the owner of the drugs on the day of the arrest. Gómez suggests that Rodríguez's testimony alone is insufficient to sustain his conviction because Rodríguez, who has been convicted of homicide and various other crimes, is not a credible witness.</p>\n<p>In order to sustain a conviction for conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. § 846, the evidence must show that (1) a conspiracy existed, (2) the defendant had knowledge of the conspiracy, and (3) the defendant knowingly and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy. <i>United States v. Pomales-Lebrón,</i> 513 F.3d 262, 267 (1st Cir. 2008). To prove the underlying offense of possession with intent to distribute, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), the government must establish that a defendant \"knowingly and intentionally possessed, either actually or constructively, a controlled substance with the specific intent to distribute.\" <i>United States v. García-Carrasquillo,</i> 483 F.3d 124, 130 (1st Cir.2007). In light of these standards, we conclude that the government presented sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find Gómez guilty.</p>\n<p>The government provided abundant evidence that Gómez provided the drugs for the transaction and was not merely an unlucky bystander. First, Rodríguez testified at trial that Gómez was present when he first met with Alverio at his mother's house to discuss re-entering the drug business, and that Gómez, whom Rodríguez knew as \"El Flaco,\" was the person who told him about prices while Alverio looked on silently. In addition, the government played a recording of a conversation between Alverio and Rodríguez from February 4, 2009, during which Rodríguez asked if the drugs he was going to buy belonged to \"the skinny guy\" whom he had met at his mother's house, and Alverio responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, toll records showed that after Alverio spoke with Rodríguez on February 4, the same phone that Alverio had used to speak with Rodríguez was used to dial a cell phone number that corresponded to the cell phone that Gómez had on the day of the arrest. Given Alverio's comment during the recorded phone call that he was going to call the friend who had the cocaine, the fact that his phone was used to call Gómez's phone provides particularly strong support for the conclusion that Gómez was the source of the drugs. A second phone call from Alverio's phone to Gómez's phone, placed immediately after Rodríguez called Alverio on the morning of February 5th, also supports the government's theory.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*419</span> In addition, Rodríguez testified at trial that Alverio said on the day of the drug transaction that the man with him in the car was the owner of the drugs. Rodríguez also noted that Gómez, after some delay, acknowledged that he remembered Rodríguez, which supports the government's theory that the man in the car was the same man that Rodríguez met initially at his mother's house.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the very fact that Gómez was in the car when the drug transaction took place provides support for the government's theory that he was a coconspirator. As Agent Alverio testified, it is not common for drug traffickers to bring innocent people to drug transactions. Of course, however, \"mere presence at the scene of conspiracy activities or simple association with conspirators is not enough, standing alone, to establish participation in a conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Rodríguez-Ortiz,</i> 455 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p>Finally, Gómez's argument that the evidence against him was insufficient because Rodríguez was not a credible witness is meritless. \"It is not for us to make credibility determinations in the course of a review of the sufficiency of the evidence.\" <i>United States v. Morales-Machuca,</i> 546 F.3d 13, 21 (1st Cir.2008). \"A conviction may be based solely on the uncorroborated testimony of a confidential informant so long as the testimony is not incredible or insubstantial on its face.\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez,</i> 219 F.3d 37, 46 (1st Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Rodríguez's testimony is not \"incredible or insubstantial on its face,\" nor is it entirely uncorroborated. Toll records and recordings of phone conversations support his version of events.</p>\n<p>For all these reasons, the evidence was sufficient to enable a rational factfinder to convict Gómez on the drug count.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Gómez's Firearm Conviction</h2>\n<p>Gómez argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his firearm conviction. In order to convict a defendant of possessing a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), \"the government must prove that the defendant[] 1) committed a drug trafficking crime; 2) knowingly possessed a firearm; and 3) possessed the firearm in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime.\" <i>United States v. Pena,</i> 586 F.3d 105, 112 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>As discussed above, there was sufficient evidence here to support the conclusion that Gómez committed a drug trafficking crime. In addition, the government presented sufficient evidence that Gómez knowingly possessed a firearm. Agent Alverio testified at trial that he saw a handgun in the \"pocket\" of the front passenger door when the defendants were arrested, and that Gómez was in the passenger's seat. Another government witness testified that the fanny pack that Gómez was wearing when he was arrested contained three .40 caliber bullets and a magazine containing fifteen more .40 caliber bullets, both of which could be used to fire the gun, a Glock .40 caliber pistol, as well as a slide back cover that \"is the rear part of the Glock.\" Finally, Rodríguez testified at trial that he thought Gómez had a gun based on the way that Gómez was positioned. This evidence was sufficient for a rational finder of fact to determine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*420</span> that Gómez knowingly possessed the firearm.</p>\n<p>Finally, as discussed in the following section, the evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that the possession was in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime. Thus, we will not disturb the verdict on Gómez's firearm count.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Alverio's Firearm Conviction</h2>\n<p>Citing 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), Alverio argues that the government had to prove that he \"1) committed a drug trafficking crime; 2) knowingly possessed a firearm; and 3) possessed the firearm in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime.\" He insists that the \"evidence was insufficient to convince a rational jury beyond a reasonable doubt that [he] possessed the Glock `in furtherance of' a drug trafficking crime.\" He was indicted, however, for aiding and abetting in the possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, which requires proof that he knew to a practical certainty that Gómez would possess the gun in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime and that he took some step to facilitate the possession. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Medina-Román,</i> 376 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2004). Consequently, we need only consider that part of his argument that also applies to an aiding-and-abetting convictionnamely, his claim that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his firearm conviction because the government failed to show that the possession of the firearm was in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. To support this contention, Alverio points to Rodríguez's testimony at trial that Alverio specifically told Rodríguez he did not want Rodríguez to verify the drugs in his vehicle, that Alverio said Gómez did not want the transaction to take place in Alverio's car, and that Alverio proposed that they go to Rodríguez's car instead. If the gun had been possessed in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime, Alverio claims, Alverio and Gómez would not have wanted Rodríguez to verify the drugs in his own car.</p>\n<p>Alverio's argument is meritless because a gun need not be present at the moment that drugs are verified, or at the moment that money or drugs change hands, in order to be possessed in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. Possession of a firearm \"to protect drugs or sales proceeds\" can constitute possession in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. <i>United States v. Marin,</i> 523 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir.2008). Here, a rational factfinder could conclude that Gómez had the gun to protect the cocaine on the way to the transaction and the money that the defendants expected to receive$3,300 for each of the six \"eighths\"on the way back from the transaction. The evidence would have been sufficient to support the conclusion that the gun was possessed in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime regardless of where the transaction occurred. Thus, we will not overturn the verdict on Alverio's gun count.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Jury Instructions</h2>\n<p>Having concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support both defendants' convictions, we must separately address the claim of instructional error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Baldyga,</i> 233 F.3d 674, 682 n. 8 (1st Cir.2000) (noting that a court could consistently conclude both that the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict and that the jury instructions constituted reversible error because of the different legal standards governing the two claims).</p>\n<p>The defendants contend that the district court's instructions on the firearm count were flawed in three ways. First, the court erred by instructing the jury on the meaning of \"us[ing] or carr[ying]\" a firearm <span class=\"star-pagination\">*421</span> \"during and in relation to\" a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), when the defendants were charged with \"possess[ing] a firearm\" \"in furtherance of\" a drug trafficking crime, <i>id.</i> Second, the court failed to instruct the jury that the mere presence of a firearm in the area where a drug trafficking offense occurs is insufficient to find a defendant guilty of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. Finally, the defendants allege that the court improperly coached the jury by incorporating details that mirrored those of their own case into the jury instructions.</p>\n<p>We review challenges to jury instructions for plain error where, as here, the defendants failed to object at trial. <i>United States v. Riccio,</i> 529 F.3d 40, 46 (1st Cir.2008). Thus, we will not disturb the convictions unless the defendants can prove \"(1) that an error occurred; (2) that the error was clear or obvious; (3) that the error affected [their] substantial rights; and (4) that the error also seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez,</i> 570 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).<sup>[4]</sup> \"[P]lain error review tends to afford relief to appellants only for `blockbuster[]' errors.\" <i>United States v. Moran,</i> 393 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>United States v. Griffin,</i> 818 F.2d 97, 100 (1st Cir.1987)); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Gomez,</i> 255 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir.2001) (\"[T]he plain-error exception is cold comfort to most defendants pursuing claims of instructional error.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Background</h2>\n<p>The district court gave the following instructions regarding the firearm count, referring throughout to the language of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) that addresses using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime:</p>\n<blockquote>The defendants are accused of using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. Basically, what that means is that while they conspired to commit the offence of possessing with intent to distribute, they at the same time used or carried a firearm.. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . You have to figure out from the evidence you received here whether indeed there was a gun here to begin with; and, number two, whether this gun was possessed, used, carried during the commission of a drug trafficking offence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>So the following things have to be proven. First, that the defendant that you're considering indeed committed the first offence, the possession, the conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute narcotics, cocaine in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Number two, that during and in relation to the commission of that crime, that particular defendant knowingly used or carried a firearm. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>To carry a firearm meansor to carry a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime means to move or transport the firearm on one's person or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*422</span> in a vehicle or in a container during and in relation to the crime. The firearm need not be immediately accessible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>To use a firearm during and in relation to a crime of this kind means to employ the firearm actively, such as brandishing, displaying it, striking it, attempting to fire it. In this case it's basically carrying it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The firearm must have played some sort of important role in the commission of the offense, must have been intended by the defendant to play an important role in the commission of the offence. And the role could have been protection, the role could have been security, whatever it may be. Okay.</blockquote>\n<p>Neither defendant objected to these instructions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Analysis</h2>\n<p>The government does not contest that the district court erred by instructing the jury regarding \"us[ing] or carr[ying]\" a firearm \"during and in relation to\" a drug trafficking crime rather than instructing it on \"possess[ing] a firearm\" \"in furtherance of\" a drug trafficking crime. 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A). The government argues, however, and we agree, that there was no reversible error here.</p>\n<p>Instructing the jury regarding \"use and carry\" instead of \"possession\" was not reversible error because \"use and carry\" necessarily includes possession. A person cannot \"use\" a firearm without possessing it. <i>See </i><i>Pena,</i> 586 F.3d at 114 (\"[E]ven if the jury thought it had to find `use[]' [instead of `possession,'] that would have been a benefit not a detriment to [the defendant].\"). One also cannot \"carry\" a firearm without possessing it. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gill,</i> 513 F.3d 836, 851 (8th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p>In addition, the instructions on \"use\" of a firearm \"during and in relation to\" a drug trafficking crime did not constitute reversible error. \"[W]e have understood `in furtherance of' to demand showing a sufficient nexus between the firearm and the drug crime such that the firearm advances or promotes the drug crime. For example, we have held that possession of a firearm to protect drugs or sales proceeds can establish such a nexus.\" <i>Marin,</i> 523 F.3d at 27 (internal citations omitted). Here, the court noted that \"the firearm must have played some sort of important role in the commission of the offense, must have been intended by the defendant to play an important role in the commission of the offence,\" and specifically gave the example cited in <i>Marin, see id.,</i> when explaining that \"the role could have been protection, the role could have been security, whatever it may be.\"</p>\n<p>This circuit has noted before that \"the `in furtherance of' element of a firearm possession charge imposes a `slightly higher standard' of liability than the nexus element corresponding to the different charges of using or carrying a firearm, which need only occur `during and in relation to' the underlying crime.\" <i>United States v. Delgado-Hernandez,</i> 420 F.3d 16, 25 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 105-344, at 11 (1997)). We are not suggesting otherwise here. We cannot see, however, how the jury could have concluded that the firearm here played an important role in the commission of the offense without concluding that the weapon met the \"in furtherance of\" requirement. Thus, reviewing for plain error, we will not overturn the jury's verdict.</p>\n<p>In light of the jury instructions described above, in convicting the defendants on the firearm charges, the jury must have concluded that the weapon was not merely present at the scene, but that it played an important role in the commission <span class=\"star-pagination\">*423</span> of the offense. Thus, we reject the claim that the district court's failure to give a \"mere presence\" instruction constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p>Finally, we reject the defendants' coaching argument. The defendants contend that the district court improperly coached the jury when it explained that \"to carry a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime means to move or transport the firearm on one's person or in a vehicle or in a container during and in relation to the crime.\" That this very language is part of the First Circuit's pattern jury instructions emphasizes that, rather than coaching, the district court was merely explaining in general terms the charge against the defendants. <i>See Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the First Circuit</i> § 4.07 (1998).<sup>[5]</sup> The defendants also allege that the district court improperly coached the jury when it instructed that the firearm \"must have played some sort of important role in the commission of the offense\" and noted that \"the role could have been protection, . . . security,\" or some other role. This guidance does not constitute coaching either. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Hernández,</i> 490 F.3d 81, 84 (1st Cir.2007) (\"It is unquestioned that, when instructing a jury, a judge `may explain, comment upon and incorporate the evidence into the instructions in order to assist the jury to understand it in light of the applicable legal principles.'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Maguire,</i> 918 F.2d 254, 268 (1st Cir. 1990))).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The <i>Brady</i> Claim</h2>\n<p>Gómez argues that the government committed a <i>Brady</i> violation by failing to provide a fingerprint analysis of the weapon found in Alverio's car. <i>See </i><i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). The government responds that no fingerprint analysis was ever performed, and thus there cannot have been a <i>Brady</i> violation.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>\"Review of the district court's decision to deny a defendant's motion for a new trial on the basis of alleged <i>Brady</i> violations is for manifest abuse of discretion.\" <i>United States v. Brandao,</i> 539 F.3d 44, 64 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Background</h2>\n<p>At trial, during cross-examination by Gómez's attorney, Agent Agreló testified as follows regarding fingerprints on the weapon:</p>\n<blockquote>Q. Any fingerprints were taken from the pistol?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. A step was taken to take fingerprints of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Were any fingerprints taken?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No. Steps were taken, but they were not able to do the analysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. I didn't hear your answer, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. They were not done. They were not performed, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. You do have the equipment to do that job; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Our lab, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. You didn't feel it necessary to take the fingerprints?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*424</span> A. Like I said before, yes, sir, I requested the test for the lab.</blockquote>\n<p>After hearing this testimony, neither defense attorney requested a continuance in order to obtain a fingerprint analysis report for the weapon. The <i>Brady</i> issue did not arise until more than ten months later, when Gómez's attorney filed an emergency motion requesting a new trial. The motion noted that, according to Agent Agreló's testimony, fingerprinting tests of the gun were ordered but never performed, and argued that the results of such tests were exculpatory evidence and should have been disclosed pursuant to <i>Brady.</i> The district court denied this motion. Gómez now appeals the district court's determination that no <i>Brady</i> violation occurred.</p>\n<p>At oral argument, we questioned counsel for the government about the possibility that a fingerprint analysis report existed. Counsel explained that she had never received notice from the government lab confirming that a fingerprint analysis report had not been completed, but that she also had never received any such report. Because the government \"`has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government's behalf,'\" <i>Moreno-Morales v. United States,</i> 334 F.3d 140, 146 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>Kyles v. Whitley,</i> 514 U.S. 419, 437, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995)), we requested that counsel for the government submit a proffer regarding whether or not the government lab ever produced a fingerprint analysis report on the machine gun. The proffer confirmed that no fingerprint analysis was ever conducted; the firearm was only examined for \"operability.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Analysis</h2>\n<p>To establish a <i>Brady</i> violation, \"a defendant must make three showings. `The evidence at issue (whether exculpatory or impeaching) must be favorable to the accused; that evidence must have been either willfully or inadvertently suppressed by the government; and prejudice must have ensued.'\" <i>United States v. Mathur,</i> 624 F.3d 498, 503 (1st Cir.2010) (quoting <i>United States v. Connolly,</i> 504 F.3d 206, 212 (1st Cir.2007)). \"Although it hardly bears mention, an implicit prerequisite of any <i>Brady</i> claim is that favorable, material evidence actually exists.\" <i>United States v. Garvin,</i> 270 Fed.Appx. 141, 144 (3d Cir. 2008). Here, because no fingerprint analysis report existed, the government did not commit a <i>Brady</i> violation in failing to turn over such a report. The failure to create exculpatory evidence does not constitute a <i>Brady</i> violation. <i>See </i><i>Arizona v. Youngblood,</i> 488 U.S. 51, 59, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988) (\"[T]he police do not have a constitutional duty to perform any particular tests.\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Nguyen,</i> 98 Fed.Appx. 608, 609 (9th Cir.2004) (\"<i>Brady</i> does not require the government to interview witnesses or otherwise create exculpatory evidence not then in existence.\" (citing <i>United States v. Monroe,</i> 943 F.2d 1007, 1011 n. 2 (9th Cir.1991))).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, we affirm both defendants' convictions.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict because the defendants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence. <i>See </i><i>United States v. García-Álvarez,</i> 541 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>[2]  They were already aware of the number of the phone that Alverio used because Alverio had called Rodríguez on that phone.</p>\n<p>[3]  Gómez argues that Agent Agreló's testimony explaining the toll records was impermissible \"overview\" testimony and should not be considered when analyzing whether the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. This argument, which Gómez presents in one sentence in his brief, has been waived because it has not been sufficiently developed. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p>[4]  The government raises the possibility that the district court might have constructively amended the indictment when it instructed the jury on using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. We need not address this issue. Even if the district court did constructively amend the indictment, the defendants must still prove that prejudice resulted. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brandao,</i> 539 F.3d 44, 62 (1st Cir.2008) (holding that a defendant who alleges constructive amendment of an indictment \"must make the required showing of prejudice under <i>Olano</i> and its progeny\"). For the reasons discussed below, they cannot do so.</p>\n<p>[5]  As we have noted previously, \"although pattern instructions are often helpful, their use is precatory, not mandatory.\" <i>United States v. Jadlowe,</i> 628 F.3d 1, 17 n. 29 (1st Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>[6]  The government also contends that the district court properly denied the defendant's motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 for a new trial because the motion was untimely. Because we resolve this issue on the merits and in favor of the government, we need not address the timeliness argument.</p>\n\n</div>",

Gómez argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him on either count; Alverio challenges the sufficiency of the evidence against him on the firearm count. Gómez also contends that the government committed a <i>Brady</i> violation, and both defendants argue that the district court erred in instructing the jury as to the firearm count. For the reasons below, we affirm both convictions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i><sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p>Rafael Rodríguez-Morales (\"Rodríguez\"), a paid confidential informant and one of the government's key witnesses at trial, first met Alverio in approximately 2004. At that time, one of Rodríguez's co-workers set up a meeting between Rodríguez and Alverio because the co-worker wanted Rodríguez to re-enter the drug trafficking business. Gómez also attended the meeting, which was at Rodríguez's mother's house. Rodríguez did not find out Gómez's real name at that meeting, but learned that his nickname was \"Flaco\" or \"El Flaco\" (i.e., \"the skinny one\"). During the meeting, Gómez spoke to Rodríguez about cocaine prices. Alverio said nothing about prices and instead, according to Rodríguez's testimony at trial, \"look[ed] at El Flaco, the one that would dictate the drug prices.\"</p>\n<p>Approximately one and a half years later, Alverio started calling Rodríguez and offering to sell him cocaine. Rodríguez, who was by then an informant for the DEA, contacted the DEA but did not receive authorization to proceed with a drug transaction.</p>\n<p>In January 2009, Alverio again called Rodríguez. This time, the DEA authorized Rodríguez to proceed and worked with him to record two conversations between him and Alverio. On January 29, 2009, Alverio said, among other things, that he would contact Rodríguez as soon as he had drugs. On February 4, 2009, Rodríguez spoke to Alverio about purchasing six \"eighths\" (i.e., eighths of a kilogram) of cocaine. The two men agreed to meet at ten o'clock the next day. Alverio said he was going to call a friend in order for the friend to give him the cocaine. Rodríguez asked if \"the man,\" or the owner of the drugs, could reduce the price by one or two hundred dollars. Later in the conversation, Rodríguez asked Alverio if the drugs belonged to the skinny man to whom Alverio had introduced Rodríguez, and Alverio responded that they did.</p>\n<p>On February 5, 2009, Rodríguez called Alverio to confirm that they were ready for the drug transaction. When Alverio arrived at the K-Mart in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, the appointed meeting place, he called Rodríguez, who was inside the store at that point. Alverio guided Rodríguez to the spot where his car was parked, and Rodríguez noticed that there was another man in Alverio's car. When Rodríguez asked Alverio if the second man was \"El Flaco,\" Alverio said that he was. Alverio <span class=\"star-pagination\">*417</span> also said, in response to a question from Rodríguez, that the other man was the owner of the drugs.</p>\n<p>When the time came to verify the drugs, Alverio asked Rodríguez if they could move to Rodríguez's car. Rodríguez replied that his car was far away and asked to verify the drugs in Alverio's car. Alverio said that the other man in the car did not want Rodríguez to verify the drugs in the car. When Rodríguez asked again if the second man was the owner of the drugs, Alverio replied affirmatively. Before visually verifying the drugs in Alverio's car, Rodríguez attempted to say hello to Gómez. Several seconds passed before Gómez responded, but when Rodríguez asked Gómez if Gómez remembered him, Gómez said that he did. According to Rodríguez's testimony at trial, Gómez was sitting sideways in the passenger seat of the car with his right hand near his thigh, giving Rodríguez the impression that there was a firearm in the car.</p>\n<p>After greeting Gómez, Rodríguez opened a small package, which Alverio had placed in the middle of the car's rear seat, that looked like a child's lunch box. The substance inside smelled like cocaine. Rodríguez then said that the air seemed charged and suggested that they move to another location, Monte Brisas. The defendants agreed that they should go to Monte Brisas and proceeded to pull away. Rodríguez, who had one leg inside the car and the other outside, was able to get out before the car departed. Once out of the car, Rodríguez reported to a DEA official that he felt his life was in danger because there were firearms in the car, and said that the defendants took the cocaine away in their vehicle.</p>\n<p>As the defendants drove toward Monte Brisas, they were stopped by a marked police vehicle. DEA Special Agent Jimmy Alverio (\"Agent Alverio\"), who had been conducting surveillance in the K-Mart parking lot and who had followed the defendants toward Monte Brisas, assisted. From the driver's side of the car, Agent Alverio noticed a gun with an extended magazine in the passenger door \"pocket.\" A firearm examiner later tested the weapon, a Glock .40 caliber pistol, and discovered that it was capable of firing automatically. Agent Alverio also saw, and later opened, the lunch box in the back seat, which a chemist subsequently determined contained just under three-fourths of a kilogram of 70.7% pure cocaine.</p>\n<p>When law enforcement officers arrested Gómez and Alverio, they seized a green fanny pack that Gómez was wearing. The fanny pack contained, among other things, three .40 caliber bullets, a magazine that contained fifteen .40 caliber bullets, a slide back cover for a Glock, a drug ledger, and nine vials of crack cocaine. Officers also seized cellular phones from Alverio and Gómez and learned the number of the phone that Gómez was carrying.<sup>[2]</sup> By analyzing toll records, DEA Agent Álvaro Agreló learned that on at least two occasions, immediately after Rodríguez spoke with Alverio, Alverio's phone was used to dial the phone that Gómez had with him on the day of the arrest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Sufficiency of the Evidence</h2>\n<p>We review <i>de novo</i> whether the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to support a conviction. <i>United States v. Rosado-Pérez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1292494\"><a href=\"/opinion/1292494/united-states-v-rosado-perez/\"><span class=\"volume\">605</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.2010). In doing so, \"[w]e take the evidence and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*418</span> draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the prosecution.\" <i>Id.</i> We will affirm \"[i]f a reasonable jury could find the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of all elements of the charged offense.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Gómez's Drug Conviction</h2>\n<p>Gómez argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine. Gómez notes that Alverio, not he, spoke to and negotiated with Rodríguez, and that he was never seen handling the drugs. In addition, Gómez contends that because the government did not perform any fingerprint analysis on the lunch box containing the drugs, it is unclear whether or not he owned the drugs. Furthermore, Gómez points out that no government agent could corroborate Rodríguez's testimony that Alverio identified Gómez as the owner of the drugs on the day of the arrest. Gómez suggests that Rodríguez's testimony alone is insufficient to sustain his conviction because Rodríguez, who has been convicted of homicide and various other crimes, is not a credible witness.</p>\n<p>In order to sustain a conviction for conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. § 846, the evidence must show that (1) a conspiracy existed, (2) the defendant had knowledge of the conspiracy, and (3) the defendant knowingly and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy. <i>United States v. Pomales-Lebrón,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203104\"><a href=\"/opinion/203104/united-states-v-pomales-lebron/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span>, 267 (1st Cir. 2008). To prove the underlying offense of possession with intent to distribute, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), the government must establish that a defendant \"knowingly and intentionally possessed, either actually or constructively, a controlled substance with the specific intent to distribute.\" <i>United States v. García-Carrasquillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202688\"><a href=\"/opinion/202688/united-states-v-garcia-carrasquillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 130 (1st Cir.2007). In light of these standards, we conclude that the government presented sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find Gómez guilty.</p>\n<p>The government provided abundant evidence that Gómez provided the drugs for the transaction and was not merely an unlucky bystander. First, Rodríguez testified at trial that Gómez was present when he first met with Alverio at his mother's house to discuss re-entering the drug business, and that Gómez, whom Rodríguez knew as \"El Flaco,\" was the person who told him about prices while Alverio looked on silently. In addition, the government played a recording of a conversation between Alverio and Rodríguez from February 4, 2009, during which Rodríguez asked if the drugs he was going to buy belonged to \"the skinny guy\" whom he had met at his mother's house, and Alverio responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, toll records showed that after Alverio spoke with Rodríguez on February 4, the same phone that Alverio had used to speak with Rodríguez was used to dial a cell phone number that corresponded to the cell phone that Gómez had on the day of the arrest. Given Alverio's comment during the recorded phone call that he was going to call the friend who had the cocaine, the fact that his phone was used to call Gómez's phone provides particularly strong support for the conclusion that Gómez was the source of the drugs. A second phone call from Alverio's phone to Gómez's phone, placed immediately after Rodríguez called Alverio on the morning of February 5th, also supports the government's theory.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*419</span> In addition, Rodríguez testified at trial that Alverio said on the day of the drug transaction that the man with him in the car was the owner of the drugs. Rodríguez also noted that Gómez, after some delay, acknowledged that he remembered Rodríguez, which supports the government's theory that the man in the car was the same man that Rodríguez met initially at his mother's house.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the very fact that Gómez was in the car when the drug transaction took place provides support for the government's theory that he was a coconspirator. As Agent Alverio testified, it is not common for drug traffickers to bring innocent people to drug transactions. Of course, however, \"mere presence at the scene of conspiracy activities or simple association with conspirators is not enough, standing alone, to establish participation in a conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Rodríguez-Ortiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795065\"><a href=\"/opinion/795065/united-states-v-arsenio-rodriguez-ortiz-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p>Finally, Gómez's argument that the evidence against him was insufficient because Rodríguez was not a credible witness is meritless. \"It is not for us to make credibility determinations in the course of a review of the sufficiency of the evidence.\" <i>United States v. Morales-Machuca,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></span>, 21 (1st Cir.2008). \"A conviction may be based solely on the uncorroborated testimony of a confidential informant so long as the testimony is not incredible or insubstantial on its face.\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199008\"><a href=\"/opinion/199008/united-states-v-gonzales-vasquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 46 (1st Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Rodríguez's testimony is not \"incredible or insubstantial on its face,\" nor is it entirely uncorroborated. Toll records and recordings of phone conversations support his version of events.</p>\n<p>For all these reasons, the evidence was sufficient to enable a rational factfinder to convict Gómez on the drug count.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Gómez's Firearm Conviction</h2>\n<p>Gómez argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his firearm conviction. In order to convict a defendant of possessing a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), \"the government must prove that the defendant[] 1) committed a drug trafficking crime; 2) knowingly possessed a firearm; and 3) possessed the firearm in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime.\" <i>United States v. Pena,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204065\"><a href=\"/opinion/204065/united-states-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">586</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 112 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>As discussed above, there was sufficient evidence here to support the conclusion that Gómez committed a drug trafficking crime. In addition, the government presented sufficient evidence that Gómez knowingly possessed a firearm. Agent Alverio testified at trial that he saw a handgun in the \"pocket\" of the front passenger door when the defendants were arrested, and that Gómez was in the passenger's seat. Another government witness testified that the fanny pack that Gómez was wearing when he was arrested contained three .40 caliber bullets and a magazine containing fifteen more .40 caliber bullets, both of which could be used to fire the gun, a Glock .40 caliber pistol, as well as a slide back cover that \"is the rear part of the Glock.\" Finally, Rodríguez testified at trial that he thought Gómez had a gun based on the way that Gómez was positioned. This evidence was sufficient for a rational finder of fact to determine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*420</span> that Gómez knowingly possessed the firearm.</p>\n<p>Finally, as discussed in the following section, the evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that the possession was in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime. Thus, we will not disturb the verdict on Gómez's firearm count.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Alverio's Firearm Conviction</h2>\n<p>Citing 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), Alverio argues that the government had to prove that he \"1) committed a drug trafficking crime; 2) knowingly possessed a firearm; and 3) possessed the firearm in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime.\" He insists that the \"evidence was insufficient to convince a rational jury beyond a reasonable doubt that [he] possessed the Glock `in furtherance of' a drug trafficking crime.\" He was indicted, however, for aiding and abetting in the possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, which requires proof that he knew to a practical certainty that Gómez would possess the gun in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime and that he took some step to facilitate the possession. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Medina-Román,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201115\"><a href=\"/opinion/201115/united-states-v-medina-roman/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.2004). Consequently, we need only consider that part of his argument that also applies to an aiding-and-abetting convictionnamely, his claim that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his firearm conviction because the government failed to show that the possession of the firearm was in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. To support this contention, Alverio points to Rodríguez's testimony at trial that Alverio specifically told Rodríguez he did not want Rodríguez to verify the drugs in his vehicle, that Alverio said Gómez did not want the transaction to take place in Alverio's car, and that Alverio proposed that they go to Rodríguez's car instead. If the gun had been possessed in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime, Alverio claims, Alverio and Gómez would not have wanted Rodríguez to verify the drugs in his own car.</p>\n<p>Alverio's argument is meritless because a gun need not be present at the moment that drugs are verified, or at the moment that money or drugs change hands, in order to be possessed in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. Possession of a firearm \"to protect drugs or sales proceeds\" can constitute possession in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. <i>United States v. Marin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203236\"><a href=\"/opinion/203236/united-states-v-marin/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.2008). Here, a rational factfinder could conclude that Gómez had the gun to protect the cocaine on the way to the transaction and the money that the defendants expected to receive$3,300 for each of the six \"eighths\"on the way back from the transaction. The evidence would have been sufficient to support the conclusion that the gun was possessed in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime regardless of where the transaction occurred. Thus, we will not overturn the verdict on Alverio's gun count.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Jury Instructions</h2>\n<p>Having concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support both defendants' convictions, we must separately address the claim of instructional error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Baldyga,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199179\"><a href=\"/opinion/199179/united-states-v-baldyga/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span>, 682 n. 8 (1st Cir.2000) (noting that a court could consistently conclude both that the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict and that the jury instructions constituted reversible error because of the different legal standards governing the two claims).</p>\n<p>The defendants contend that the district court's instructions on the firearm count were flawed in three ways. First, the court erred by instructing the jury on the meaning of \"us[ing] or carr[ying]\" a firearm <span class=\"star-pagination\">*421</span> \"during and in relation to\" a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), when the defendants were charged with \"possess[ing] a firearm\" \"in furtherance of\" a drug trafficking crime, <i>id.</i> Second, the court failed to instruct the jury that the mere presence of a firearm in the area where a drug trafficking offense occurs is insufficient to find a defendant guilty of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. Finally, the defendants allege that the court improperly coached the jury by incorporating details that mirrored those of their own case into the jury instructions.</p>\n<p>We review challenges to jury instructions for plain error where, as here, the defendants failed to object at trial. <i>United States v. Riccio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203852\"><a href=\"/opinion/203852/united-states-v-riccio/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 46 (1st Cir.2008). Thus, we will not disturb the convictions unless the defendants can prove \"(1) that an error occurred; (2) that the error was clear or obvious; (3) that the error affected [their] substantial rights; and (4) that the error also seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v.

Background</h2>\n<p>The district court gave the following instructions regarding the firearm count, referring throughout to the language of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) that addresses using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime:</p>\n<blockquote>The defendants are accused of using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. Basically, what that means is that while they conspired to commit the offence of possessing with intent to distribute, they at the same time used or carried a firearm.. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . You have to figure out from the evidence you received here whether indeed there was a gun here to begin with; and, number two, whether this gun was possessed, used, carried during the commission of a drug trafficking offence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>So the following things have to be proven. First, that the defendant that you're considering indeed committed the first offence, the possession, the conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute narcotics, cocaine in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Number two, that during and in relation to the commission of that crime, that particular defendant knowingly used or carried a firearm. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>To carry a firearm meansor to carry a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime means to move or transport the firearm on one's person or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*422</span> in a vehicle or in a container during and in relation to the crime. The firearm need not be immediately accessible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>To use a firearm during and in relation to a crime of this kind means to employ the firearm actively, such as brandishing, displaying it, striking it, attempting to fire it. In this case it's basically carrying it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The firearm must have played some sort of important role in the commission of the offense, must have been intended by the defendant to play an important role in the commission of the offence. And the role could have been protection, the role could have been security, whatever it may be. Okay.</blockquote>\n<p>Neither defendant objected to these instructions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Analysis</h2>\n<p>The government does not contest that the district court erred by instructing the jury regarding \"us[ing] or carr[ying]\" a firearm \"during and in relation to\" a drug trafficking crime rather than instructing it on \"possess[ing] a firearm\" \"in furtherance of\" a drug trafficking crime. 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A). The government argues, however, and we agree, that there was no reversible error here.</p>\n<p>Instructing the jury regarding \"use and carry\" instead of \"possession\" was not reversible error because \"use and carry\" necessarily includes possession. A person cannot \"use\" a firearm without possessing it. <i>See </i><i>Pena,</i> 586 F.3d at 114 (\"[E]ven if the jury thought it had to find `use[]' [instead of `possession,'] that would have been a benefit not a detriment to [the defendant].\"). One also cannot \"carry\" a firearm without possessing it. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1270491\"><a href=\"/opinion/1270491/united-states-v-gill/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span>, 851 (8th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p>In addition, the instructions on \"use\" of a firearm \"during and in relation to\" a drug trafficking crime did not constitute reversible error. \"[W]e have understood `in furtherance of' to demand showing a sufficient nexus between the firearm and the drug crime such that the firearm advances or promotes the drug crime. For example, we have held that possession of a firearm to protect drugs or sales proceeds can establish such a nexus.\" <i>Marin,</i> 523 F.3d at 27 (internal citations omitted). Here, the court noted that \"the firearm must have played some sort of important role in the commission of the offense, must have been intended by the defendant to play an important role in the commission of the offence,\" and specifically gave the example cited in <i>Marin, see id.,</i> when explaining that \"the role could have been protection, the role could have been security, whatever it may be.\"</p>\n<p>This circuit has noted before that \"the `in furtherance of' element of a firearm possession charge imposes a `slightly higher standard' of liability than the nexus element corresponding to the different charges of using or carrying a firearm, which need only occur `during and in relation to' the underlying crime.\" <i>United States v. Delgado-Hernandez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201780\"><a href=\"/opinion/201780/united-states-v-delgado-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 105-344, at 11 (1997)). We are not suggesting otherwise here. We cannot see, however, how the jury could have concluded that the firearm here played an important role in the commission of the offense without concluding that the weapon met the \"in furtherance of\" requirement. Thus, reviewing for plain error, we will not overturn the jury's verdict.</p>\n<p>In light of the jury instructions described above, in convicting the defendants on the firearm charges, the jury must have concluded that the weapon was not merely present at the scene, but that it played an important role in the commission <span class=\"star-pagination\">*423</span> of the offense. Thus, we reject the claim that the district court's failure to give a \"mere presence\" instruction constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p>Finally, we reject the defendants' coaching argument. The defendants contend that the district court improperly coached the jury when it explained that \"to carry a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime means to move or transport the firearm on one's person or in a vehicle or in a container during and in relation to the crime.\" That this very language is part of the First Circuit's pattern jury instructions emphasizes that, rather than coaching, the district court was merely explaining in general terms the charge against the defendants. <i>See Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the First Circuit</i> § 4.07 (1998).<sup>[5]</sup> The defendants also allege that the district court improperly coached the jury when it instructed that the firearm \"must have played some sort of important role in the commission of the offense\" and noted that \"the role could have been protection, . . . security,\" or some other role. This guidance does not constitute coaching either. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Hernández,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202796\"><a href=\"/opinion/202796/united-states-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.2007) (\"It is unquestioned that, when instructing a jury, a judge `may explain, comment upon and incorporate the evidence into the instructions in order to assist the jury to understand it in light of the applicable legal principles.'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Maguire,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551274\"><a href=\"/opinion/551274/united-states-v-john-j-maguire-united-states-v-thomas-m-kavanagh/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span>, 268 (1st Cir. 1990))).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The <i>Brady</i> Claim</h2>\n<p>Gómez argues that the government committed a <i>Brady</i> violation by failing to provide a fingerprint analysis of the weapon found in Alverio's car. <i>See </i><i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The government responds that no fingerprint analysis was ever performed, and thus there cannot have been a <i>Brady</i> violation.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>\"Review of the district court's decision to deny a defendant's motion for a new trial on the basis of alleged <i>Brady</i> violations is for manifest abuse of discretion.\" <i>United States v.

Background</h2>\n<p>At trial, during cross-examination by Gómez's attorney, Agent Agreló testified as follows regarding fingerprints on the weapon:</p>\n<blockquote>Q. Any fingerprints were taken from the pistol?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. A step was taken to take fingerprints of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Were any fingerprints taken?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. No. Steps were taken, but they were not able to do the analysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. I didn't hear your answer, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. They were not done. They were not performed, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. You do have the equipment to do that job; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Our lab, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. You didn't feel it necessary to take the fingerprints?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*424</span> A. Like I said before, yes, sir, I requested the test for the lab.</blockquote>\n<p>After hearing this testimony, neither defense attorney requested a continuance in order to obtain a fingerprint analysis report for the weapon. The <i>Brady</i> issue did not arise until more than ten months later, when Gómez's attorney filed an emergency motion requesting a new trial. The motion noted that, according to Agent Agreló's testimony, fingerprinting tests of the gun were ordered but never performed, and argued that the results of such tests were exculpatory evidence and should have been disclosed pursuant to <i>Brady.</i> The district court denied this motion. Gómez now appeals the district court's determination that no <i>Brady</i> violation occurred.</p>\n<p>At oral argument, we questioned counsel for the government about the possibility that a fingerprint analysis report existed. Counsel explained that she had never received notice from the government lab confirming that a fingerprint analysis report had not been completed, but that she also had never received any such report. Because the government \"`has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government's behalf,'\" <i>Moreno-Morales v.

The proffer confirmed that no fingerprint analysis was ever conducted; the firearm was only examined for \"operability.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Analysis</h2>\n<p>To establish a <i>Brady</i> violation, \"a defendant must make three showings. `The evidence at issue (whether exculpatory or impeaching) must be favorable to the accused; that evidence must have been either willfully or inadvertently suppressed by the government; and prejudice must have ensued.'\" <i>United States v. Mathur,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"178676\"><a href=\"/opinion/178676/united-states-v-mathur/\"><span class=\"volume\">624</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span>, 503 (1st Cir.2010) (quoting <i>United States v. Connolly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202977\"><a href=\"/opinion/202977/united-states-v-connolly/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 212 (1st Cir.2007)). \"Although it hardly bears mention, an implicit prerequisite of any <i>Brady</i> claim is that favorable, material evidence actually exists.\" <i>United States v. Garvin,</i> 270 Fed.Appx. 141, 144 (3d Cir. 2008). Here, because no fingerprint analysis report existed, the government did not commit a <i>Brady</i> violation in failing to turn over such a report. The failure to create exculpatory evidence does not constitute a <i>Brady</i> violation. <i>See </i><i>Arizona v. Youngblood,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></span>, 59, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></span> (1988) (\"[T]he police do not have a constitutional duty to perform any particular tests.\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Nguyen,</i> 98 Fed.Appx. 608, 609 (9th Cir.2004) (\"<i>Brady</i> does not require the government to interview witnesses or otherwise create exculpatory evidence not then in existence.\" (citing <i>United States v. Monroe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567723\"><a href=\"/opinion/567723/united-states-v-walker-bennett-monroe/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1007</span></a></span>, 1011 n. 2 (9th Cir.1991))).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, we affirm both defendants' convictions.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict because the defendants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence. <i>See </i><i>United States v. García-Álvarez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203467\"><a href=\"/opinion/203467/united-states-v-garcia-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>[2]  They were already aware of the number of the phone that Alverio used because Alverio had called Rodríguez on that phone.</p>\n<p>[3]  Gómez argues that Agent Agreló's testimony explaining the toll records was impermissible \"overview\" testimony and should not be considered when analyzing whether the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. This argument, which Gómez presents in one sentence in his brief, has been waived because it has not been sufficiently developed. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p>[4]  The government raises the possibility that the district court might have constructively amended the indictment when it instructed the jury on using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. We need not address this issue. Even if the district court did constructively amend the indictment, the defendants must still prove that prejudice resulted. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brandao,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1427539\"><a href=\"/opinion/1427539/united-states-v-brandao/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir.2008) (holding that a defendant who alleges constructive amendment of an indictment \"must make the required showing of prejudice under <i>Olano</i> and its progeny\"). For the reasons discussed below, they cannot do so.</p>\n<p>[5]  As we have noted previously, \"although pattern instructions are often helpful, their use is precatory, not mandatory.\" <i>United States v. Jadlowe,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 17 n. 29 (1st Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>[6]  The government also contends that the district court properly denied the defendant's motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 for a new trial because the motion was untimely. Because we resolve this issue on the merits and in favor of the government, we need not address the timeliness argument.</p>\n\n</div>",
