Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Rachel Brill for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Senior\nAppellate Attorney, with whom H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney,\nwas on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                        December 30, 2005\n\f              BOUDIN, Chief Judge.          Jose Guillermo Rodriguez-Gonzalez\n\n(\"Rodriguez\") was indicted by a federal grand jury for conspiring\n\nto commit credit card fraud, for aiding and abetting bank fraud and\n\nfor money laundering.              18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1344, 1956(a)(1)(h)\n\n(2000).       In substance, the indictment charged Rodriguez with\n\nparticipating in a ring to obtain and improperly exploit credit\n\ncard numbers; his role was described as that of a \"runner\" who\n\nassisted      other   co-conspirators        in   the    illegal   acquisition    of\n\nmerchandise, in recruiting new conspirators and in arranging for\n\nthe transfer of devices to glean account information from credit\n\ncards.\n\n              Each count of the indictment specified that Rodriguez had\n\nconspired with others \"[f]rom in or about December of 2002, and\n\ncontinuing through in or about November of 2003.\"                  The indictment\n\ncharged Rodriguez with having committed an overt act in furtherance\n\nof the credit-card and bank-fraud offenses \"[o]n or about August\n\n18,   2003    through   on    or    about    August      20,   2003,\"   namely,   by\n\nrecruiting an unnamed individual to join the conspiracy and making\n\narrangements to transfer to him the device for gleaning information\n\nfrom credit cards.\n\n              Rodriguez thereafter entered into a plea agreement with\n\nthe government to plead guilty to the credit-card and bank-fraud\n\nviolations. The plea agreement described the indictment's counts--\n\nto    which   Rodriguez      was    pleading--as        charging   Rodriguez   with\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fparticipating from December 2002 through November 2003, leaving the\n\nimpression that he was accepting that premise.          In exchange, the\n\ngovernment said in the agreement that it would dismiss the money\n\nlaundering count and would recommend that Rodriguez be sentenced at\n\nthe lower end of the applicable guideline range.\n\n           Rodriguez and the government also expressly agreed to\n\nspecific guideline enhancements, based on the implicit assumption\n\nthat he was responsible for conduct throughout the conspiracy--a\n\nloss of over $400,000, U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1)(G), and between 10\n\nand 50 victims, U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(2)(A).       A separate stipulation\n\nof facts attached to the plea agreement referred to the 11-month\n\nduration of the conspiracy and the $400,000 loss but did not\n\nexpressly link Rodriguez' participation to any specific time period\n\napart from noting the dates of his overt act (August 18-20, 2003).\n\n           At the change of plea hearing, the judge was explaining\n\nthe nature of the charges to Rodriguez when his then-counsel\n\nconveyed   to   the   judge   Rodriguez'   assertion   that   he   \"did   not\n\nparticipate in the whole scheme of time on the conspiracy.\"               The\n\njudge replied:    \"[E]ven if you didn't start at the beginning, you\n\nare to be held accountable just as if you had been there since the\n\nbeginning and you would be responsible for the conduct of the co-\n\nconspirators, ever since the conspiracy started.\"         Defense counsel\n\ndid not disagree, and Rodriguez proceeded with his guilty plea.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f           Thereafter, a presentence report was prepared setting\n\nforth the guideline calculation to which the parties had agreed in\n\nthe plea agreement.    The report described the full duration of the\n\nconspiracy, the amount of the loss, and the number of victims\n\nwithout saying anything about when Rodriguez had joined.            By then\n\nRodriguez had acquired new counsel (who also represents him on\n\nappeal) who objected that the enhancements for loss and the number\n\nof victims should be reduced or eliminated because, according to\n\ncounsel, Rodriguez' participation had not been shown to extend\n\nbeyond the two days of his one overt act in August 2003.\n\n           At   sentencing,    defense    counsel   pressed      this   same\n\nobjection; the district judge rejected it.            The judge had (as\n\nalready   noted)   expressed   at   the   plea   hearing   the   view   that\n\nRodriguez was legally responsible for the actions of his co-\n\nconspirators from the start of the conspiracy; and the judge made\n\nclear that he believed that Rodriguez was seeking to escape from\n\nstipulations made in the plea agreement.             Rodriguez was then\n\nsentenced to 46 months' imprisonment at the bottom of the 46 to 57\n\nmonths range.\n\n           In the course of the sentencing, the government, seeking\n\nto refute defense counsel's suggestion that Rodriguez had joined\n\nthe conspiracy only in mid-August 2003, said that it had evidence\n\nto the contrary.      Although the proffer was not developed, it\n\nappears that the government may have had tape recordings indicating\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fthat Rodriguez was, at the very least, aware of the contours of the\n\nconspiracy and its key players well before August 2003.                      In any\n\nevent, the district judge made no independent findings as to the\n\ndate of Rodriguez' joinder, apparently relying instead on the plea\n\nagreement stipulations and the judge's own view that the precise\n\ndate   did   not    matter    under    existing    law    as    to     late-joining\n\nconspirators.\n\n             Rodriguez then appealed to this court to contest the\n\ninclusion in the guideline calculation of the $400,000 and 10 to 50\n\nvictim enhancements.         Viewing the plea agreement stipulation as\n\nclear, this court entered a judgment, whose mandate has not yet\n\nissued,   summarily       affirming    the    sentence.        Then,    on   defense\n\ncounsel's petition for rehearing, the court agreed to reexamine the\n\nmatter and held an expedited oral argument.              Although it is a close\n\ncall, we now conclude that a remand is appropriate and supplant our\n\nearlier            judgment           with        this          decision.\n\n             There is nothing surprising in the district judge's\n\nbelief, when confronted with defense counsel's objections to the\n\nenhancements,      that    Rodriguez    was    trying     to    back-pedal     from\n\nstipulations that he had made in the plea agreement.                   Ordinarily,\n\na defendant can be held to such stipulations.                   United States v.\n\nTeeter, 257 F.3d 14, 28 (1st Cir. 2001).                   Further, a special\n\nproblem exists where, as here, a defendant seems to disavow his\n\nstipulations without seeking to set aside the plea agreement, as\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fthe government has ordinarily paid a price for the agreement\n\n(although in this case defense counsel thinks that Rodriguez got\n\nlittle from the agreement).1\n\n           Over and above the stipulation as to the enhancements,\n\nthe plea agreement's description of the conspiracy charge as\n\nextending for 11 months and its assertion that Rodriguez was\n\npleading guilty to the two counts based on the indictment certainly\n\ninvited a reasonable reader to understand that Rodriguez was\n\nagreeing that in fact he had participated for the full period\n\ncharged.   The attached stipulation of facts, although it did not\n\nsay when he entered the conspiracy, said nothing that negated the\n\nagreement which indicated that he had participated throughout.\n\n           If this were the sum total of events, we would join with\n\nthe district judge in thinking that the stipulation and Rodriguez'\n\nunqualified guilty plea established that Rodriguez had participated\n\nin the full conspiracy.   The difficulty is that before the judge\n\naccepted the guilty plea, Rodriguez specifically told the judge\n\nthat he (Rodriguez) had not been in the conspiracy from the outset.\n\nAnd when one looks back at the plea agreement, it becomes clear--at\n\nleast in light of Rodriguez' disavowal--that it is not an airtight\n\n\n\n     1\n      Defense counsel did move to set aside the agreement on the\nground that the enhancements were not consistent with Blakely v.\nWashington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004); but that claim has not been\npursued on this appeal, and counsel never sought to withdraw the\nplea based on misunderstanding or mistaken advice given to\nRodriguez as to the enhancements.\n\n                                -6-\n\ffactual admission that Rodriguez participated from the beginning.\n\nHad he thought it relevant, doubtless the district judge would have\n\nsought to clear up the arguable inconsistency before accepting the\n\nplea.\n\n             The district judge did not do so because, at least in\n\npart,   he    relied     on   the    generalization     that   a    late-joining\n\nconspirator takes the conspiracy as he finds it and is responsible\n\nfor what happened prior to his joinder.                   This is true in one\n\ncontext: co-conspirator statements, made even before the defendant\n\njoined the conspiracy, are admissible against him as admissions by\n\na co-conspirator. United States v. O'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, 1022-23\n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (quoting United States v. Cintolo, 818 F.2d 980,\n\n997 (1st Cir. 1987)).\n\n             Events in a conspiracy prior to a defendant's joinder may\n\nbe   relevant    in    various    ways   beyond   the   admissibility     of    co-\n\nconspirator statements.          But there is no need to explore the ways\n\nin which such pre-joinder events might or might not be relevant to,\n\nsay, the statute of limitations or the characterization of the\n\nconspiracy      or    Pinkerton     liability.      For    when    it   comes   to\n\nsentencing, the guidelines say that a defendant is responsible only\n\nfor losses that occurred and victims who were injured after he\n\njoined and, then, only to the extent that they were foreseeable by\n\nhim.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f             In the words of the Sentencing Commission, \"A defendant's\n\nrelevant conduct does not include the conduct of members of a\n\nconspiracy prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy, even if\n\nthe defendant knows of that conduct . . . .\"                U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3,\n\ncomment. (n.2).       Rather, for sentencing purposes, the court \"is\n\nrequired to make an individualized finding as to [the conduct]\n\nattributable to, or foreseeable by, that defendant.\" United States\n\nv. Colin-Solis, 354 F.3d 101, 103 (1st Cir. 2004); see also\n\nU.S.S.G. § 1B1.3.      Thus, in our case, the factual question of when\n\nRodriguez joined the conspiracy is not made irrelevant by any legal\n\nprinciple imposing on him liability for sentencing purposes of\n\nprior acts of the conspiracy.\n\n             Yet   this   leaves   Rodriguez'   stipulation        that   he   was\n\nsubject   to    the   enhancements.     Defense    counsel    says    that     the\n\nsentencing judge is supposed to impose the correct sentence based\n\non the evidence regardless of the parties' stipulation, but this is\n\ntoo loose a statement:        Teeter makes clear that a trial judge,\n\nalthough not required to follow a stipulation (outside Fed. R.\n\nCrim.   P.     11(c)(1)©),   may   normally     rely   on    the    defendant's\n\nstipulation in determining what is the correct sentence.\n\n             There are qualifications on such reliance--for example,\n\na mistaken stipulation on a matter of law–-but the precise timing\n\nof Rodriguez' entry into the conspiracy is not of that kind.\n\nIndeed, there is still no affirmative evidence of record, beyond\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fthe defendant's summary say-so at the plea hearing, that the\n\nstipulation was factually mistaken.                 Certainly a summary and\n\nunilateral disavowal by the defendant does not itself negate a\n\nstipulation.\n\n               Thus, our original summary affirmance of the sentence was\n\nsupportable. Nevertheless, we now think that given the defendant's\n\ncaveat at the plea hearing, the district judge would likely have\n\ninsisted on clarifying the stipulation at the plea hearing, had it\n\nnot been for the court's seeming misunderstanding as to the law\n\ngoverning pre-joinder conduct of co-conspirators.                After all, the\n\ncontradiction between what the plea agreement suggested and the\n\ndefendant's own protest was stark.\n\n               Under these peculiar circumstances, we think the just\n\ncourse    is    to   remand   the    matter   to    the   district     court   for\n\nresentencing at which the court is free to reconsider afresh what\n\nweight, if any, to give to the possibly suspect stipulation.                   If\n\nthe court determines to give the stipulation less than ordinary\n\nweight,   it     will   presumably    warn    the   government    so    that   the\n\ngovernment can muster its own evidence of the extent of Rodriguez'\n\ninvolvement in the conspiracy.\n\n               The case does afford lessons all around:           the need for\n\ncare in the drafting of plea stipulations; the distinctions to be\n\ndrawn in the rules applying in different contexts to late-joining\n\nconspirators; the benefit of persistence by able defense counsel;\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fand   the   ability   of   the   iterative   judicial   process   to   remedy\n\nmistakes, whether in the trial court or on appeal.\n\n            The petition for rehearing is granted and this court's\n\njudgment of July 20, 2005 is vacated.         The sentence is vacated and\n\nthe matter remanded to the district court for resentencing in\n\naccordance with this opinion.\n\n            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f",

In substance, the indictment charged Rodriguez with participating in a ring to obtain and improperly exploit credit card numbers; his role was described as that of a \"runner\" who assisted other co-conspirators in the illegal acquisition of merchandise, in recruiting new conspirators and in arranging for the transfer of devices to glean account information from credit cards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each count of the indictment specified that Rodriguez had conspired with others \"[f]rom in or about December of 2002, and continuing through in or about November of 2003.\" The indictment charged Rodriguez with having committed an overt act in furtherance of the credit-card and bank-fraud offenses \"[o]n or about August 18, 2003 through on or about August 20, 2003,\" namely, by recruiting an unnamed individual to join the conspiracy and making arrangements to transfer to him the device for gleaning information from credit cards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez thereafter entered into a plea agreement with the government to plead guilty to the credit-card and bank-fraud violations.

A separate stipulation of facts attached to the plea agreement referred to the 11-month duration of the conspiracy and the $400,000 loss but did not expressly link Rodriguez' participation to any specific time period apart from noting the dates of his overt act (August 18-20, 2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the change of plea hearing, the judge was explaining the nature of the charges to Rodriguez when his then-counsel conveyed to the judge Rodriguez' assertion that he \"did not participate in the whole scheme of time on the conspiracy.\" The judge replied: \"[E]ven if you didn't start at the beginning, you are to be held accountable just as if you had been there since the beginning and you would be responsible for the conduct of the co-conspirators, ever since the conspiracy started.\" Defense counsel did not disagree, and Rodriguez proceeded with his guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, a presentence report was prepared setting forth the guideline calculation to which the parties had agreed in the plea agreement.

By then Rodriguez had acquired new counsel (who also represents him on appeal) who objected that the enhancements for loss and the number of victims should be reduced or eliminated because, according to counsel, Rodriguez' participation had not been shown to extend beyond the two days of his one overt act in August 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, defense counsel pressed this same objection; the district judge rejected it.

Ordinarily, a defendant can be held to such stipulations. <i>United States v. Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d 14, 28 (1st Cir.2001). Further, a special problem exists where, as here, a defendant seems to disavow his stipulations without seeking to set aside the plea agreement, as the government has ordinarily paid a price for the agreement (although in this case defense counsel thinks that Rodriguez got little from the agreement).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over and above the stipulation as to the enhancements, the plea agreement's description of the conspiracy charge as extending for 11 months and its assertion that Rodriguez was pleading guilty to the two counts based on the indictment certainly invited a reasonable reader to understand that Rodriguez was agreeing that <i>in fact</i> he had participated for the full period charged.

The difficulty is that before the judge accepted the guilty plea, Rodriguez specifically told the judge that he (Rodriguez) had not been in the conspiracy from the outset. And when one looks back at the plea agreement, it becomes clear&#8212;at least in light of Rodriguez' disavowal&#8212;that it is not an airtight factual admission that Rodriguez participated from the beginning. Had he thought it relevant, doubtless the district judge would have sought to clear up the arguable inconsistency before accepting the plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge did not do so because, at least in part, he relied on the generalization that a late-joining conspirator takes the conspiracy as he finds it and is responsible for what happened prior to his joinder. This is true in one context: co-conspirator statements, made even before the defendant joined the conspiracy, are admissible against him as admissions by a co-conspirator. <i>United States v. O'Campo,</i> 973 F.2d 1015, 1022-23 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting <i>United States v. Cintolo,</i> 818 F.2d 980, 997 (1st Cir.1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Events in a conspiracy prior to a defendant's joinder may be relevant in various ways beyond the admissibility of co-conspirator statements. But there is no need to explore the ways in which such pre-joinder events might or might not be relevant to, say, the statute of limitations or the characterization of the conspiracy or <i>Pinkerton</i> liability. For when it comes to sentencing, the guidelines say that a defendant is responsible only for losses that occurred and victims who were injured <i>after</i> he joined and, then, only to the extent that they were foreseeable by him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the words of the Sentencing Commission, \"A defendant's relevant conduct does not include the conduct of members of a conspiracy prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy, even if the defendant knows of that conduct....\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, comment. (n.2). Rather, for sentencing purposes, the court \"is required to make an individualized finding as to [the conduct] attributable to, or foreseeable by, that defendant.\" <i>United States v. Colon-Solis,</i> 354 F.3d 101, 103 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3. Thus, in our case, the factual question of when Rodriguez joined the conspiracy is not made irrelevant by any legal principle imposing on him liability for sentencing purposes of prior acts of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet this leaves Rodriguez' <i>stipulation</i> that he was subject to the enhancements. Defense counsel says that the sentencing judge is supposed to impose the correct sentence based on the evidence regardless of the parties' stipulation, but this is too loose a statement: <i>Teeter</i> makes clear that a trial judge, although not required to follow a stipulation (outside Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)&#169;), may normally rely on the defendant's stipulation in determining what is the correct sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are qualifications on such reliance&#8212;for example, a mistaken stipulation on a matter of law&#8212;but the precise timing of Rodriguez' entry into the conspiracy is not of that kind. Indeed, there is still no affirmative evidence of record, beyond the defendant's summary say-so at the plea hearing, that the stipulation was factually mistaken. Certainly a summary and unilateral disavowal by the defendant does not itself negate a stipulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, our original summary affirmance of the sentence was supportable. Nevertheless, we now think that given the defendant's caveat at the plea hearing, the district judge would likely have insisted on clarifying the stipulation at the plea hearing, had it not been for the court's seeming misunderstanding as to the law governing pre-joinder conduct of co-conspirators. After all, the contradiction between what the plea agreement suggested and the defendant's own protest was stark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these peculiar circumstances, we think the just course is to remand the matter to the district court for resentencing at which the court is free to reconsider afresh what weight, if any, to give to the possibly suspect stipulation. If the court determines to give the stipulation less than ordinary weight, it will presumably warn the government so that the government can muster its own evidence of the extent of Rodriguez' involvement in the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case does afford lessons all around: the need for care in the drafting of plea stipulations; the distinctions to be drawn in the rules applying in different contexts to late-joining conspirators; the benefit of persistence by able defense counsel; and the ability of the iterative judicial process to remedy mistakes, whether in the trial court or on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for rehearing is <i>granted</i> and this court's judgment of July 20, 2005 is <i>vacated.</i> The sentence is <i>vacated</i> and the matter <i>remanded</i> to the district court for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Defense counsel did move to set aside the agreement on the ground that the enhancements were not consistent with<i>Blakely v.

Garcia, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before BOUDIN, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOUDIN, Chief Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jose Guillermo Rodriguez-Gonzalez (\"Rodriguez\") was indicted by a federal grand jury for conspiring to commit credit card fraud, for aiding and abetting bank fraud and for money laundering. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 371, 1344, 1956(a)(1)(h) (2000). In substance, the indictment charged Rodriguez with participating in a ring to obtain and improperly exploit credit card numbers; his role was described as that of a \"runner\" who assisted other co-conspirators in the illegal acquisition of merchandise, in recruiting new conspirators and in arranging for the transfer of devices to glean account information from credit cards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each count of the indictment specified that Rodriguez had conspired with others \"[f]rom in or about December of 2002, and continuing through in or about November of 2003.\" The indictment charged Rodriguez with having committed an overt act in furtherance of the credit-card and bank-fraud offenses \"[o]n or about August 18, 2003 through on or about August 20, 2003,\" namely, by recruiting an unnamed individual to join the conspiracy and making arrangements to transfer to him the device for gleaning information from credit cards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez thereafter entered into a plea agreement with the government to plead guilty to the credit-card and bank-fraud violations. The plea agreement described the indictment's counts&#8212;to which Rodriguez was pleading&#8212;as charging Rodriguez with participating from December 2002 through November 2003, leaving the impression that he was accepting that premise. In exchange, the government said in the agreement that it would dismiss the money laundering count and would recommend that Rodriguez be sentenced at the lower end of the applicable guideline range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez and the government also expressly agreed to specific guideline enhancements, based on the implicit assumption that he was responsible for conduct throughout the conspiracy-a loss of over $400,000, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1(b)(1)(G), and between 10 and 50 victims, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1(b)(2)(A). A separate stipulation of facts attached to the plea agreement referred to the 11-month duration of the conspiracy and the $400,000 loss but did not expressly link Rodriguez' participation to any specific time period apart from noting the dates of his overt act (August 18-20, 2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the change of plea hearing, the judge was explaining the nature of the charges to Rodriguez when his then-counsel conveyed to the judge Rodriguez' assertion that he \"did not participate in the whole scheme of time on the conspiracy.\" The judge replied: \"[E]ven if you didn't start at the beginning, you are to be held accountable just as if you had been there since the beginning and you would be responsible for the conduct of the co-conspirators, ever since the conspiracy started.\" Defense counsel did not disagree, and Rodriguez proceeded with his guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, a presentence report was prepared setting forth the guideline calculation to which the parties had agreed in the plea agreement. The report described the full duration of the conspiracy, the amount of the loss, and the number of victims without saying anything about when Rodriguez had joined. By then Rodriguez had acquired new counsel (who also represents him on appeal) who objected that the enhancements for loss and the number of victims should be reduced or eliminated because, according to counsel, Rodriguez' participation had not been shown to extend beyond the two days of his one overt act in August 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, defense counsel pressed this same objection; the district judge rejected it. The judge had (as already noted) expressed at the plea hearing the view that Rodriguez was legally responsible for the actions of his co-conspirators from the start of the conspiracy; and the judge made clear that he believed that Rodriguez was seeking to escape from stipulations made in the plea agreement. Rodriguez was then sentenced to 46 months' imprisonment at the bottom of the 46 to 57 months range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of the sentencing, the government, seeking to refute defense counsel's suggestion that Rodriguez had joined the conspiracy only in mid-August 2003, said that it had evidence to the contrary. Although the proffer was not developed, it appears that the government may have had tape recordings indicating that Rodriguez was, at the very least, aware of the contours of the conspiracy and its key players well before August 2003. In any event, the district judge made no independent findings as to the date of Rodriguez' joinder, apparently relying instead on the plea agreement stipulations and the judge's own view that the precise date did not matter under existing law as to late-joining conspirators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez then appealed to this court to contest the inclusion in the guideline calculation of the $400,000 and 10 to 50 victim enhancements. Viewing the plea agreement stipulation as clear, this court entered a judgment, whose mandate has not yet issued, summarily affirming the sentence. Then, on defense counsel's petition for rehearing, the court agreed to reexamine the matter and held an expedited oral argument. Although it is a close call, we now conclude that a remand is appropriate and supplant our earlier judgment with this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing surprising in the district judge's belief, when confronted with defense counsel's objections to the enhancements, that Rodriguez was trying to back-pedal from stipulations that he had made in the plea agreement. Ordinarily, a defendant can be held to such stipulations. <i>United States v. Teeter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199507\"><a href=\"/opinion/199507/united-states-v-teeter/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.2001). Further, a special problem exists where, as here, a defendant seems to disavow his stipulations without seeking to set aside the plea agreement, as the government has ordinarily paid a price for the agreement (although in this case defense counsel thinks that Rodriguez got little from the agreement).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over and above the stipulation as to the enhancements, the plea agreement's description of the conspiracy charge as extending for 11 months and its assertion that Rodriguez was pleading guilty to the two counts based on the indictment certainly invited a reasonable reader to understand that Rodriguez was agreeing that <i>in fact</i> he had participated for the full period charged. The attached stipulation of facts, although it did not say when he entered the conspiracy, said nothing that negated the agreement which indicated that he had participated throughout.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this were the sum total of events, we would join with the district judge in thinking that the stipulation and Rodriguez' unqualified guilty plea established that Rodriguez had participated in the full conspiracy. The difficulty is that before the judge accepted the guilty plea, Rodriguez specifically told the judge that he (Rodriguez) had not been in the conspiracy from the outset.

This is true in one context: co-conspirator statements, made even before the defendant joined the conspiracy, are admissible against him as admissions by a co-conspirator. <i>United States v.
