A Massachusetts Superior Court\n\njury convicted Tabue Smiley of first-degree felony murder, illegal\n\npossession of a firearm, kidnaping, and armed assault in connection\n\nwith a joint venture to rob a drug dealer which ended with one\n\nperson dead and two others wounded.           Smiley appeals the district\n\ncourt's denial of his habeas petition, challenging the first-degree\n\nmurder conviction with claims of ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nin the pre-trial proceedings.             Since the state court decision\n\naffirming    his   conviction   was       neither   contrary   to,   nor   an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), we affirm.\n\n                                      I\n\n            On October 31, 1993, Smiley and four other individuals --\n\nDennis Hardy, Fred Shinholster, Calvashon Johnson, and Shandell\n\nRedd (\"defendants\") -- decided to rob Oliver Edwards of drugs and\n\nmoney.1     They went to the apartment of Eric Williams, who sold\n\ndrugs for Edwards, under the pretense of buying drugs so that\n\nWilliams could page Edwards.     Upon Edwards's arrival at Williams's\n\n\n\n\n1\n   These facts are taken from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\nCourt’s recitation of the facts, Commonwealth v. Smiley, 727 N.E.2d\n1182, 1185 (Mass. 2000), which is entitled to a presumption of\ncorrectness under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1). See, e.g., Coombs v.\nMaine, 202 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 2000); cf. Sumner v. Mata, 449\nU.S. 539, 545-47 (1981) (presumption of correctness under former\nhabeas statute applied to \"factual determinations made by state\ncourts, whether the court be a trial court or appellate court\").\n\n                                  -2-\n\fapartment, the defendants held both at gunpoint and forced them to\n\ngo to Edwards's apartment.\n\n          When they arrived at Edwards's apartment, Hardy confined\n\nWilliams in a closet and the defendants forced Edwards onto a\n\nliving room couch, along with Edwards's girlfriend,       June Johnson,\n\nwho was present in the apartment when they arrived.           Hardy and\n\nShinholster then threatened Edwards and Johnson to disclose the\n\nlocation of drugs and money.     Edwards eventually said that there\n\nwas cocaine in the basement, after which Smiley and Redd went to\n\nsearch the basement.\n\n          Hardy took Edwards to the basement stairs and shot him,\n\ncausing Edwards to fall down the stairs.        Hardy returned to the\n\nliving room and shot Johnson, despite Smiley's protestations.         In\n\nthe process, Hardy's pistol jammed, so Hardy took Smiley's pistol\n\nand went to the basement to shoot Edwards two more times.           Hardy\n\nalso shot Williams twice.    Although Williams and Johnson survived,\n\nEdwards died from his wounds.\n\n          Before   Hardy   finished   his   shooting   rampage,   Smiley,\n\nShinholster, and Johnson ran out of the apartment.        They then met\n\nwith Hardy and Redd at Rasheem Reid's house.       At Hardy's request,\n\nShinholster hid the semiautomatic gun in a cemetery behind Reid's\n\nhouse.\n\n          A few days later, Shinholster turned himself in and led\n\nthe police to the cemetery where he hid the gun.            Shinholster\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\feventually testified against Smiley. On November 3, 2003, Smiley's\n\nmother   engaged   the   services   of     Attorney    Elton     Williams     to\n\nfacilitate Smiley's surrender.          After consulting with Attorney\n\nWilliams, Smiley gave a detailed statement to the police regarding\n\nthe   incident.      Williams    served      as     Smiley's    counsel       for\n\napproximately four more weeks, after which he was replaced by\n\nappointed counsel.\n\n           A Hampden County grand jury indicted Smiley for the\n\nmurder of Edwards, illegal possession of a firearm, the kidnaping\n\nof Williams and Johnson, and armed assault in a dwelling.               Prior to\n\ntrial, Smiley moved to suppress his police statement on the basis\n\nof ineffective assistance by Attorney Williams.               The trial judge\n\ndenied the motion, finding that \"Mr. Williams advised the defendant\n\nof the consequences of making a statement to the police; that there\n\nwas advice given and understood; that the defendant could be\n\nconvicted of first degree murder on the felony murder theory as\n\nwell as on the joint venture theory.\"            See Smiley, 727 N.E.2d at\n\n1187 (citing trial judge's findings).\n\n           On August 21, 1994, the jury convicted Smiley of first-\n\ndegree felony murder, indicating by special verdicts that both\n\narmed robbery and armed assault in a dwelling constituted the\n\nunderlying   felonies.     The   jury     also    convicted    Smiley    of   the\n\nremaining charges.   Smiley received a mandatory life term for the\n\nmurder conviction and lesser concurrent sentences for the kidnaping\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fand illegal possession of a firearm convictions.             On November 28,\n\n1997, Smiley filed a motion for a new trial, which the trial court\n\ndenied after a non-evidentiary hearing.\n\n            On May 12, 2000, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\n\n(SJC)     affirmed    the    convictions,     finding,   inter    alia,     that\n\n\"defendant    was    not    denied    effective   assistance     of    counsel.\"\n\nSmiley, 727 N.E.2d at 1182.           The SJC rejected Smiley's arguments\n\nthat Attorney Williams failed to complete an adequate factual\n\ninvestigation, that he provided inadequate and misleading legal\n\nadvice, and that he failed to pursue the opportunity of Smiley\n\nbecoming a cooperating witness.           Id. at 1186-88.      In so finding,\n\nthe SJC deferred to the trial judge's findings of facts, as it\n\n\"accept[s] the motion judge's subsidiary findings of fact absent\n\nclear error.\"       Id. at 1186-87 (citing Commonwealth v. Yesilciman,\n\n550 N.E.2d 378 (Mass. 1990)).\n\n            In 2001, Smiley petitioned for habeas relief under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254, arguing, among other things, ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel that led to an unprotected confession.                     In 2003, a\n\nmagistrate judge recommended that the petition be dismissed, and in\n\n2004, the district court agreed.          Smiley filed a timely notice of\n\nappeal,     and   the      district   court   granted    a   certificate      of\n\nappealability on September 9, 2004.           We review a district court's\n\ndenial of habeas relief de novo.          See, e.g., Mello v. DiPaulo, 295\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fF.3d 137, 145 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing Nadeau v. Matesanz, 289 F.3d\n\n13, 15 (1st Cir. 2002)).\n\n                                       II\n\n            A    criminal   defendant        claiming    a   Sixth     Amendment\n\nineffective assistance violation must establish that (1) \"counsel's\n\nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\"\n\nand   (2)   \"a    reasonable   probability       that,   but    for    counsel's\n\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\n\ndifferent.\"      Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984).\n\nSee also Mello, 295 F.3d at 142.             \"A reasonable probability is a\n\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\"\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\n\n            A    habeas   petitioner    must     further     show,    under   the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, Pub. L. No. 104-132,\n\n110 Stat. 1214 (1996), that the state court's decision \"resulted in\n\na decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\n\napplication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\n\nthe Supreme Court of the United States.\"            Id. § 2254(d)(1).         The\n\n\"contrary to\" prong is satisfied when the state court \"applies a\n\nrule that contradicts the governing law set forth in [the Supreme\n\nCourt's] cases,\" Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 405 (2000), or\n\nif \"the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially\n\nindistinguishable from a decision of [the Supreme Court] and\n\nnevertheless arrives at a [different] result,\" id. at 406.                    The\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f\"unreasonable application\" prong is satisfied if the state court\n\n\"identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme\n\nCourt's] decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the\n\nfacts of the prisoner's case.\"            Id. at 413.           Moreover, \"a federal\n\nhabeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court\n\nconcludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court\n\ndecision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or\n\nincorrectly.       Rather, that application must also be unreasonable.\"\n\nId. at 411.\n\n            On     previous    occasions,       we       have    noted    that   \"[t]he\n\nStrickland    principles       for     deciding      ineffective         assistance   of\n\ncounsel claims are 'clearly established' for purposes of the\n\nAEDPA.\"    Ouber v. Guarino       293 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing\n\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 371-74).                 We have also noted that \"'the\n\nstandard for ineffective assistance under Massachusetts law appears\n\nfunctionally equivalent to the federal standard.'\"                         Stephens v.\n\nHall, 294 F.3d 210, 214-15 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Phoenix v.\n\nMatesanz, 189 F.3d 20, 27 n.4 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            In the instant case, Smiley argues that Attorney Williams\n\nrendered     ineffective      assistance       by    arranging       an    unprotected\n\nconfession    to    first     degree    murder      --    without    conducting       any\n\nindependent fact investigation or adequate legal research -- in\n\nhopes of being offered cooperating witness status and a second\n\ndegree murder plea, and then abandoned all negotiations with the\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fDistrict Attorney after the confession.         The confession, Smiley\n\nargues, prejudiced his defense because it was used against him in\n\ncross-examination,   it     helped   form   Shinholster's      account     and\n\n\"devastating\"   testimony    against   him,   and   it   was   used   in   the\n\nprosecutor's closing argument.\n\n          We cannot conclude, however, that the SJC unreasonably\n\napplied the legal principles of Strickland to the facts of Smiley's\n\ncase.2   The SJC, in finding that counsel's performance was not\n\ndeficient, deferred to the motion judge's finding that counsel\n\nadvised Smiley not to make any statements to the police, that it\n\nwas Smiley who wanted to cooperate with the prosecutor and had\n\ninitiated the subject himself, and that counsel advised Smiley,\n\nbefore meeting with the police, that \"he could be responsible for\n\nthe homicide even though he never pulled the trigger himself.\"\n\nSmiley, 727 N.E.2d at 1187.     Counsel also explained to Smiley that\n\n\n\n2\n   Although the SJC did not specifically refer to Strickland, it\ndid refer to cases which cite the seminal Massachusetts case on\nineffective assistance, Commonwealth v. Saferian, 315 N.E.2d 878\n(Mass. 1974).    Smiley, 727 N.E.2d at 1186-87 (citing Care &\nProtection of Stephen, 514 N.E.2d 1087 (Mass. 1987); Commonwealth\nv. Chetwynde, 574 N.E.2d 407 (Mass. 1991)).      We have noted on\nseveral occasions that even if the SJC does not cite Strickland for\nthe ineffective assistance of counsel standard, the Saferian\nstandard is \"functionally identical to the federal standard,\"\nMello, 295 F.3d at 144 (citing Scarpa v. DuBois, 38 F.3d 1, 7 n.4;\nOuber, 293 F.3d at 35), and is therefore sufficient for habeas\nineffective assistance claims. In the instant case, we note that\nthe SJC decision is not \"contrary to\" Strickland, as the SJC did\nnot apply a rule that contradicts the Strickland principles, nor\nconfronted a set of facts materially indistinguishable from the\nStrickland facts. Williams, 529 U.S. at 405-06.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fa possible benefit of cooperation, while not guaranteed, could be\n\na possible plea of second degree murder,3 and counsel did not rush\n\nSmiley into making a statement.       Moreover, contrary to Smiley's\n\ncontention, the motion judge found that counsel did investigate the\n\nfacts of the case by interviewing Smiley and other witnesses, by\n\nspeaking with a co-defendant's attorney, and by reviewing written\n\ndiscovery materials.   Thus, the SJC agreed with the motion judge's\n\nfinding that \"defendant did not receive any 'bad' or incorrect\n\nlegal advice,\" id., and Smiley presents no \"clear and convincing\n\nevidence\" that their factual findings are otherwise incorrect. See\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(e).    Smiley does not cite to any Supreme Court\n\nprecedent to support his contention, and we cannot find any reason\n\nat this juncture to hold, that an attorney's inability to secure a\n\ncooperating witness status or inability to continue negotiations\n\nwith the district attorney after a confession constitutes a Sixth\n\nAmendment ineffective assistance violation. Thus, we find that the\n\n\n\n\n3\n   Smiley argues that his attorney misunderstood Massachusetts'\nhomicide sentencing laws and misadvised him that he could plead to\nsecond degree murder and negotiate for a term of years sentence,\nrather than the mandated life sentence (with a possibility of\nparole after 15 years).     Even assuming that this is true, the\nopportunity to plead to second degree murder was later offered to,\nand rejected by, Smiley. In any event, the motion judge had found\nthat \"Attorney Williams advised the defendant that he could be\nresponsible for the homicide even though he never pulled the\ntrigger himself . . . under the theory of joint venture or a theory\nof felony murder.\"\n\n                                -9-\n\fSJC's holding was not an unreasonable application of the first\n\nStrickland prong.4\n\n                                  III\n\n           Since we cannot say that the SJC's rejection of Smiley's\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim \"was contrary to, or\n\ninvolved   an   unreasonable   application   of,   clearly   established\n\nFederal law,\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), the district court's judgment\n\nis affirmed.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n4\n   Even if we assume, however, that \"counsel's representation fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness,\" we fail to find\nprejudice resulting therefrom. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. As\nSmiley concedes, the Commonwealth never introduced his police\nstatement during the trial, and to the extent that it was used to\nimpeach his testimony, the trial judge specifically instructed the\njury that prior inconsistent statements could not be used as\nsubstantive evidence. Under similar reasoning, we cannot conclude\nthat the prosecutor's use of that statement during closing\narguments would have substantially altered the outcome of the case.\nOuber, 293 F.3d at 25-26. It was Smiley's trial counsel who first\nintroduced that statement, and Smiley cites no precedent holding\nthat such a statement used only for impeachment purposes is\nunconstitutional and warrants habeas relief. Smiley's remaining\nprejudice argument -- that his police statement was used by\nShinholster in testifying against him -- also falters. The record\nis devoid of any suggestion that Shinholster used Smiley's\nstatement to craft a different story at trial, and in any event, we\nfind no Supreme Court precedent suggesting -- and we find no reason\nto now hold -- that such a statement shown to a prosecution witness\nwarrants habeas relief. Because we find it difficult to accept\nthat \"but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the\nproceeding would have been different,\" no Strickland prejudice\nexists.

The confession, Smiley argues, prejudiced his defense because it was used against him in cross-examination, it helped form Shinholster's account and \"devastating\" testimony against him, and it was used in the prosecutor's closing argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot conclude, however, that the SJC unreasonably applied the legal principles of <i>Strickland</i> to the facts of Smiley's case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The SJC, in finding that counsel's performance was not deficient, deferred to the motion judge's finding that counsel advised Smiley not to make any statements to the police, that it was Smiley who wanted to cooperate with the prosecutor and had initiated the subject himself, and that counsel advised Smiley, before meeting with the police, that \"he could be responsible for the homicide even though he never pulled the trigger himself.\" <i>Smiley,</i> 727 N.E.2d at 1187. Counsel also explained to Smiley that a possible benefit of cooperation, while not guaranteed, could be a possible plea of second degree murder,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and counsel did not rush Smiley into making a statement. Moreover, contrary to Smiley's contention, the motion judge found that counsel did investigate the facts of the case by interviewing Smiley and other witnesses, by speaking with a co-defendant's attorney, and by reviewing written discovery materials. Thus, the SJC agreed with the motion judge's finding that \"defendant did not receive any `bad' or incorrect legal advice,\" <i>id.,</i> and Smiley presents no \"clear and convincing evidence\" that their factual findings are otherwise incorrect. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(e). Smiley does not cite to any Supreme Court precedent to support his contention, and we cannot find any reason at this juncture to hold, that an attorney's inability to secure a cooperating witness status or inability to continue negotiations with the district attorney after a confession constitutes a Sixth Amendment ineffective assistance violation.

In the instant case, we note that the SJC decision is not \"contrary to\" <i>Strickland,</i> as the SJC did not apply a rule that contradicts the <i>Strickland</i> principles, nor confronted a set of facts materially indistinguishable from the <i>Strickland</i> facts. <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 405-06, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Smiley argues that his attorney misunderstood Massachusetts' homicide sentencing laws and misadvised him that he could plead to second degree murder and negotiate for a term of years sentence, rather than the mandated life sentence (with a possibility of parole after 15 years). Even assuming that this is true, the opportunity to plead to second degree murder was later offered to, and rejected by, Smiley. In any event, the motion judge had found that \"Attorney Williams advised the defendant that he could be responsible for the homicide even though he never pulled the trigger himself ... under the theory of joint venture or a theory of felony murder.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Even if we assume, however, that \"counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\" we fail to find prejudice resulting therefrom<i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. As Smiley concedes, the Commonwealth never introduced his police statement during the trial, and to the extent that it was used to impeach his testimony, the trial judge specifically instructed the jury that prior inconsistent statements could not be used as substantive evidence. Under similar reasoning, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor's use of that statement during closing arguments would have substantially altered the outcome of the case. <i>Ouber,</i> 293 F.3d at 25-26. It was Smiley's trial counsel who first introduced that statement, and Smiley cites no precedent holding that such a statement used only for impeachment purposes is unconstitutional and warrants habeas relief. Smiley's remaining prejudice argument &#8212; that his police statement was used by Shinholster in testifying against him &#8212; also falters. The record is devoid of any suggestion that Shinholster used Smiley's statement to craft a different story at trial, and in any event, we find no Supreme Court precedent suggesting &#8212; and we find no reason to now hold &#8212; that such a statement shown to a prosecution witness warrants habeas relief. Because we find it difficult to accept that \"but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\" no <i>Strickland</i> prejudice exists. <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Edwards eventually said that there was cocaine in the basement, after which Smiley and Redd went to search the basement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hardy took Edwards to the basement stairs and shot him, causing Edwards to fall down the stairs.

Moreover, contrary to Smiley's contention, the motion judge found that counsel did investigate the facts of the case by interviewing Smiley and other witnesses, by speaking with a co-defendant's attorney, and by reviewing written discovery materials. Thus, the SJC agreed with the motion judge's finding that \"defendant did not receive any `bad' or incorrect legal advice,\" <i>id.,</i> and Smiley presents no \"clear and convincing evidence\" that their factual findings are otherwise incorrect. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(e). Smiley does not cite to any Supreme Court precedent to support his contention, and we cannot find any reason at this juncture to hold, that an attorney's inability to secure a cooperating witness status or inability to continue negotiations with the district attorney after a confession constitutes a Sixth Amendment ineffective assistance violation.

As Smiley concedes, the Commonwealth never introduced his police statement during the trial, and to the extent that it was used to impeach his testimony, the trial judge specifically instructed the jury that prior inconsistent statements could not be used as substantive evidence. Under similar reasoning, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor's use of that statement during closing arguments would have substantially altered the outcome of the case. <i>Ouber,</i> 293 F.3d at 25-26. It was Smiley's trial counsel who first introduced that statement, and Smiley cites no precedent holding that such a statement used only for impeachment purposes is unconstitutional and warrants habeas relief. Smiley's remaining prejudice argument &#8212; that his police statement was used by Shinholster in testifying against him &#8212; also falters. The record is devoid of any suggestion that Shinholster used Smiley's statement to craft a different story at trial, and in any event, we find no Supreme Court precedent suggesting &#8212; and we find no reason to now hold &#8212; that such a statement shown to a prosecution witness warrants habeas relief. Because we find it difficult to accept that \"but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\" no <i>Strickland</i> prejudice exists. <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 694, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
