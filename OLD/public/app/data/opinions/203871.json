Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr. U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jonathan R. Saxe, Assistant Federal Public Defender, on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Aixa Maldonado-Quiñones, Assistant United States Attorney, and\nThomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                              June 16, 2009\n\f           Per Curiam.      This is the defendant's appeal from the\n\ndistrict court's discretionary denial of his motion for a sentence\n\nreduction under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and the retroactively\n\namended crack guidelines.        As discussed more fully below, because\n\nthe   district   court   acted   within    its   discretion   in   denying   a\n\nsentence reduction, primarily because of the defendant's misconduct\n\nwhile incarcerated, we summarily affirm the district court's order\n\ndenying the reduction.\n\n           For these purposes, we accept the parties' agreement that\n\nthe defendant's eligibility for a sentence reduction is undisputed.\n\nThus, the only issue before us is whether the district court abused\n\nits discretion in denying a reduction under the circumstances\n\npresented here.    See United States v. Caraballo, 552 F.3d 6, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 2008) (stating applicable standard of appellate review), cert.\n\ndenied, 129 S. Ct. 1929 (2009).\n\n           In denying a reduction, the district court expressly\n\n\"t[ook] into account all of the facts and circumstances of this\n\ncase up to the time of the original sentencing, public safety\n\nconsiderations, the post-sentencing conduct of the defendant, and\n\nthe factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. §] 3553(a).\"              Based on those\n\nappropriate considerations, see USSG § 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(B))\n\n(eff. Mar. 3, 2008); United States v. Borden, 564 F.3d 100, 103 (2d\n\nCir. 2009), the court concluded \"that the defendant's sentence\n\nshould not be reduced because the defendant remains at a high risk\n\n                                     -2-\n\fof recidivism, he poses a threat to the safety of the community,\n\nand he has failed to engage in the ordinary rehabilitative efforts\n\nthat are expected of a prisoner prior to being released into the\n\ncommunity\"   and    that   the   87-month    sentence    originally     imposed\n\ntherefore remained sufficient but not greater than necessary.\n\nThose conclusions were based on uncontested evidence that, while\n\nincarcerated,      the   defendant   refused   to     participate     in    drug-\n\ntreatment, GED, and release-preparation programs recommended by\n\nprison staff, refused to follow through on recommendations to\n\nobtain   work,   repeatedly      disobeyed   orders     of   prison   officials\n\nthereby interfering with prison operations and jeopardizing prison\n\nsecurity, and twice threatened prison officials with physical harm.\n\n           The court expressly considered the defendant's argument,\n\nreiterated on appeal, that he had already been punished for his\n\ndisciplinary infractions.        As grounds for rejecting that argument,\n\nthe court reasoned that \"the Sentencing Commission was undoubtedly\n\naware of the fact that prisoners who violate disciplinary rules are\n\nsubject to disciplinary action when it provided in the application\n\nnotes to Section 1B1.10 that the court shall consider public safety\n\nand may consider post-sentencing conduct in determining whether a\n\nreduction is warranted and the extent of such reduction.\"                  Id. at\n\n3 (referring to USSG § 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(B)).                     The court\n\nfurther explained that \"[t]he mere fact that the defendant has been\n\ndisciplined for his conduct does not mitigate the seriousness of\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthat conduct when viewed from the perspective of public safety or\n\nobviate the need on his part to engage in ordinary rehabilitative\n\nefforts that are indicative of a prisoner's preparation to re-enter\n\nsociety as a law abiding citizen.\"              Those remarks echoed the\n\ncourt's warning at the defendant's original sentencing that if the\n\ndefendant did not begin to deal with his long-standing drug problem\n\nwhile incarcerated, \"then in the end, it will deal with you.\"             We\n\nsee nothing unreasonable or arbitrary in that analysis.\n\n            The    court   also    implicitly   rejected   the   defendant's\n\nargument, also reiterated on appeal, that he was not a threat to\n\npublic safety because, once he had served his prison term, he would\n\nbe detained and subject to deportation.          As grounds for rejecting\n\nthat   argument,    the    court   implicitly   adopted    the   government's\n\ncounter-argument that, even if detained and ultimately deported,\n\nthe defendant would still pose a threat to immigration authorities\n\nuntil deported and to the public in his native country after that.\n\nThat rationale is not unreasonable either.           See generally United\n\nStates v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514 at 519, 520 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(en banc)     (rejecting a similar argument and stating that \"a\n\n[sentencing] court's reasoning can often be inferred by comparing\n\nwhat was argued by the parties or contained in the pre-sentence\n\nreport with what the judge did\").\n\n            The defendant's primary argument on appeal is that the\n\ndistrict court placed too much emphasis on his post-sentencing\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fconduct and too little on various purportedly mitigating factors,\n\nwhich factors, he argues, rendered his original sentence too high.\n\nHowever, the weight to be given to various factors is for the\n\ndistrict court to determine and not for an appellate court to\n\nsecond-guess.        United States v. Pulido, 2009 WL 1395838, at *11\n\n(1st Cir. May 20, 2009); United States v. Dixon, 449 F.3d 194, 205\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).       And a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding is not the\n\nforum for relitigating the propriety of the defendant's original\n\nsentence.      See   USSG   §    1B1.10(b)(1)        (providing    that,      in    such\n\nproceedings,    \"the    court     shall     substitute      only   the     [relevant\n\nretroactive] amendments . . . for the corresponding guideline\n\nprovisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and\n\nshall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected\").\n\n             That the district court referred to the defendant's\n\noriginal guideline range as \"advisory\" even though the defendant\n\nwas sentenced before United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005),\n\nwhen   the    guidelines        were     considered     mandatory,       is    of    no\n\nconsequence.         From   the        record   of    the   section      3582(c)(2)\n\nproceedings, it is obvious that the district court was aware that\n\nit had originally sentenced the defendant before Booker.                             As\n\nrecounted in the defendant's memorandum in support of his request\n\nfor a sentence reduction, the defendant had previously sought a\n\nremand for resentencing for that very reason. See United States v.\n\nJoseph, 278 F. App'x 1, 1 (1st Cir. May 23, 2008) (per curiam)\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f(unpublished).   Moreover, although the guidelines were mandatory\n\nwhen the defendant was originally sentenced, the district court\n\nexpressly considered the section 3553(a) factors, including the\n\ndefendant's need for deterrence and rehabilitation, in declining to\n\ndepart downward from the otherwise applicable guideline range.\n\nThus, contrary to the defendant's contention, the district court\n\nconsidered   those   factors   both    at   the   defendant's    original\n\nsentencing and in the section 3553(a) proceedings.\n\n          Accordingly,   the   district     court's   order     denying   a\n\nsentence reduction is summarily affirmed. See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",
