This is an appeal by Marisol\n\nRodríguez-Díaz and her husband José Rafael Ferreras-Durán from a\n\ndecision granting summary judgment to Dr. Javier J. Rodríguez-\n\nBecerra (\"Dr. Rodríguez\") and his insurer Seguros Triple-S, Inc. in\n\na medical malpractice action brought under Article 1802 of the\n\nPuerto Rico Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5141 (1990).             We\n\nrecount the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs as\n\nthe non-moving parties.       Statchen v. Palmer, 623 F.3d 15, 16 (1st\n\nCir. 2010).\n\n           In early 2007, Rodríguez-Díaz, a forty-five-year-old\n\nwoman then resident in Puerto Rico with a personal and family\n\nhistory of thyroid cancer, felt a lesion in her left parotid gland,\n\nwhich is one of the salivary glands.            Her treating physician, Dr.\n\nJosé   Arsuaga,    referred   her   to   Hato    Rey   Pathology   Associates\n\n(\"HRPA\") to undergo a fine needle aspiration biopsy of her left\n\nparotid gland.     Dr. Rodríguez, a physician at HRPA, performed the\n\nbiopsy on March 1 and issued a cytology report on March 6.\n\n           Dr. Rodríguez's report provided a pathologic diagnosis of\n\npleomorphic adenoma, which is a benign tumor of the salivary\n\nglands.   That diagnosis--and Dr. Rodríguez's failure to conduct a\n\n\"differential diagnosis\"--is the basis of this suit.            Differential\n\ndiagnosis is a standard technique for \"the determination of which\n\nof two or more diseases with similar symptoms is the one from which\n\nthe    patient    is   suffering,   by     a    systematic   comparison   and\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fcontrasting    of    the     clinical      findings.\"         Stedman's     Medical\n\nDictionary 492 (27th ed. 2000); see also Baker v. Dalkon Shield\n\nClaimants Trust, 156 F.3d 248, 252-53 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n              Dr. Arsuaga told Rodríguez-Díaz of Dr. Rodríguez's\n\ndiagnosis on March 30, 2007, and recommended surgical removal of\n\nthe tumor--the standard treatment for pleomorphic adenoma--but said\n\nthat there was no urgency.                Rodríguez-Díaz later scheduled a\n\nconsultation    with      Dr.    Thomas   Shellenberger,      a   head    and   neck\n\nsurgical oncologist at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Orlando,\n\nFlorida, and requested her biopsy slides from HRPA to take to Dr.\n\nShellenberger.      Under HRPA policy, this request required a review\n\nof the slides by another HRPA physician.\n\n           Dr. Víctor J. Carlo-Chévere (\"Dr. Carlo\"), one of Dr.\n\nRodríguez's colleagues at HRPA, reviewed Rodríguez-Díaz's slides\n\nand diagnosis.       Dr. Carlo conducted a differential diagnosis,\n\nincluded mucoepidermoid carcinoma--a malignant tumor--as one of the\n\npossibilities, and therefore conducted a mucicarmine stain (which\n\nDr.   Rodríguez     had    not   done)    to    check   for   mucin,     indicating\n\nmucoepidermoid carcinoma.          Dr. Carlo produced an amended cytology\n\nreport that changed Rodríguez-Díaz's pathologic diagnosis from\n\npleomorphic adenoma to low grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma.\n\n           On July 18, 2007, Rodríguez-Díaz picked up the slides and\n\nDr. Carlo's amended cytology report with the revised diagnosis of\n\na malignant tumor.         She alleges that when she read Dr. Carlo's\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\freport, realized Dr. Rodríguez's report was not correct, and\n\nlearned she had cancer, she and her husband were shocked and their\n\nlives fell apart.         Now mistrusting Puerto Rico physicians, they\n\nresorted at great expense to health care in the continental United\n\nStates, which their health insurer refused to cover.\n\n           On    August    29,   2007,   Dr.    Shellenberger     successfully\n\noperated   on    Rodríguez-Díaz,    surgically      removing    the    malignant\n\ntumor.   The attendant pathology confirmed the revised diagnosis of\n\na malignant tumor.     Within the year, on August 8, 2008, Rodríguez-\n\nDíaz and her husband brought this malpractice action in federal\n\ndistrict court in Puerto Rico against Dr. Rodríguez and his medical\n\ninsurer.    Having    become     residents     of   Florida,    they    premised\n\njurisdiction on diversity.        Their claim was that Dr. Rodríguez had\n\nbeen negligent in failing to conduct a differential diagnosis.\n\n           During discovery, Dr. Rodríguez stated that he had not\n\nconducted a differential diagnosis because the evidence that he\n\ndiscerned in studying the biopsy slide and described in his report\n\n(specifically,     myxoid stroma, epithelioid cells, and plasmacytoid\n\ncells) persuaded him that Rodríguez-Díaz suffered from a benign\n\ntumor,   making    unnecessary     any    differential     diagnosis.       The\n\ndefendants thereafter moved for summary judgment. Their supporting\n\nevidence went considerably beyond Dr. Rodríguez's explanation.\n\n           The    defense    offered     by    expert   witness   report    and\n\ndeposition testimony that the treatment for pleomorphic adenoma--\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fwhich can become malignant--and low grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma\n\nare the same; that Rodríguez-Díaz had received the appropriate\n\ntreatment in sufficient time; that an Orlando specialist had in\n\nJuly 2007 reviewed the same slides and made no diagnosis of\n\nmalignancy; and that no definitive diagnosis could be made until\n\nsurgery.\n\n            In opposition, Rodríguez-Díaz offered no expert testimony\n\non the standard of care.     She relied primarily on the failure of\n\nDr. Rodríguez to conduct a differential diagnosis and thus to\n\nconsider low grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma as an alternative to\n\npleomorphic adenoma; on Dr. Carlo's use of the technique and the\n\nmucicarmine stain test in an attempt to exclude this alternative;\n\nand on Dr. Carlo's correct diagnosis and its confirmation after\n\nsurgery.    Rodríguez-Díaz made no claim of physical harm from the\n\ndelay in surgery but did claim emotional distress and increased\n\nexpenses due to her concern about medical care in Puerto Rico.\n\n            On September 22, 2009, the district court granted the\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment, ruling that the plaintiffs\n\ncould not establish a prima facie claim of medical malpractice\n\nunder Article 1802 because they had not offered expert evidence\n\nestablishing the relevant standard of care.        The plaintiffs now\n\nappeal.    Our review is de novo.    Great Clips, Inc. v. Hair Cuttery\n\nof Greater Bos., L.L.C., 591 F.3d 32, 35 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f           This being a diversity suit, the substantive law of\n\nPuerto Rico governs.   Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78\n\n(1938).   Under Puerto Rico law, the applicable rule of decision in\n\na medical malpractice action is fault-based, Martínez-Serrano v.\n\nQuality Health Servs. of P.R., Inc., 568 F.3d 278, 285 (1st Cir.\n\n2009); Article 1802 provides in pertinent part that \"[a] person who\n\nby an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or\n\nnegligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\"      P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 31, § 5141.\n\n           To show medical malpractice, a plaintiff must establish\n\nthat the care afforded did not meet \"the professional requirements\n\ngenerally acknowledged by the medical profession.\"   Santiago Otero\n\nv. Méndez, 1994 P.R.-Eng. 909,224, 135 P.R. Dec. 540 (1994); see\n\nalso Pagés-Ramírez v. Ramírez-González, 605 F.3d 109, 113 (1st Cir.\n\n2010) (listing the elements). This, in turn, \"[a]lmost invariably\"\n\nrequires the plaintiff to introduce expert testimony. Cruz-Vázquez\n\nv. Mennonite Gen. Hosp., Inc., 613 F.3d 54, 56 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\nUnder Puerto Rico law, to make out a prima facie case of physician\n\nnegligence:\n\n           Plaintiff must establish, through expert\n           evidence, the degree of care and scientific\n           knowledge required by the profession in the\n           treatment of a specific type of patient.\n\nRodríguez Crespo v. Hernández, 21 P.R. Offic. Trans. 637, 647\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f(1988).1\n           Despite such broad statements, the jury's own common\n\nsense could occasionally close the gap and establish that the care\n\nafforded did not meet minimal standards.                See Rolon-Alvarado v.\n\nMunicipality of San Juan, 1 F.3d 74, 79 (1st Cir. 1993) (offering\n\nexamples of possible exceptions); W. Keeton et al., Prosser and\n\nKeeton on the Law of Torts § 32, at 189 (5th ed. 1984) (same).               And\n\nthe   expert     evidence,    if   required,    might    come   not   from   the\n\nplaintiff's expert but rather from, say, the defense expert or\n\nadmissions by the defendant doctor.             See Chizmadia v. Smiley's\n\nPoint Clinic, 873 F.2d 1163, 1165 (8th Cir. 1989).                The present\n\ncase, however, fits neither of these possible exceptions.\n\n           Differential diagnosis is a standard tool, but as to what\n\nsymptoms   and    in   what   conditions    a   differential     diagnosis    is\n\nrequired for proper medical care, no lay jury would be likely to\n\nknow on its own.       Rolon-Alvarado, 1 F.3d at 79.        The fact that Dr.\n\nCarlo conducted a differential diagnosis in this case, and that its\n\napplication led to the correct diagnosis, does not show that\n\nfailing to use it was negligent.         There is no indication that Dr.\n\nCarlo or another physician testifying as an expert was prepared to\n\nsay otherwise.\n\n\n\n      1\n      See also Pagés-Ramírez, 605 F.3d at 113; Martínez-Serrano,\n568 F.3d at 285; Rojas-Ithier v. Sociedad Espanola de Auxilio Mutuo\ny Beneficiencia de P.R., 394 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir. 2005); Cortés-\nIrizarry v. Corporación Insular de Seguros, 111 F.3d 184, 190 (1st\nCir. 1997); Lama v. Borras, 16 F.3d 473, 478 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                                      -7-\n\f               In the present case, counsel for Rodríguez-Díaz was asked\n\nat oral argument why no expert was presented for the plaintiffs; he\n\nanswered, quite plausibly, that he made every effort to find one\n\nbut was unsuccessful. This hardly disproves the plaintiffs' claim:\n\ndoctors, especially in tightknit communities, may be hesitant to\n\naccuse each other; pathology is a specialized field which could\n\nfurther narrow the supply of experts; and although experts can\n\nusually be found somewhere at some price, the lack of physical\n\ninjury here likely limited what the plaintiffs could promise to\n\npay.\n\n               Plaintiffs' counsel made an admirable effort to do his\n\nown medical research.           He cited both in the district court and on\n\nthis       appeal    a   2002   study   in   a   medical   periodical      for   the\n\nproposition that low grade carcinoma is one of the differential\n\ndiagnoses of pleomorphic adenoma.2               Yet he has not argued directly\n\nthat this article, standing by itself, would allow the jury to\n\nconclude that every pleomorphic adenoma requires for proper medical\n\ntreatment a differential diagnosis or the mucicarmine stain test.\n\n               We think that the implicit concession is warranted.               The\n\narticle      is     highly   technical--even      to   understand   much    of   the\n\n\n       2\n      Stanley, Selected Problems in Fine Needle Aspiration of Head\nand Neck Masses, 15 Modern Pathology 342 (2002). He also cited\nliterature to support the view that, where mucin is present, a\ndefinitive judgment should be deferred pending further testing, see\nJacobs, Low Grade Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma ex Pleomorphic Adenoma,\n38 Acta Cytologica 93 (1994), but such literature is of no help in\nestablishing when proper care requires the test to identify mucin.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fterminology would require a medical dictionary and probably some\n\nscience--and nowhere does it contain a flat statement that in every\n\ncase    where   pleomorphic   adenoma      is   diagnosed    a   differential\n\ndiagnosis or the mucicarmine stain test is required.             To say that\n\na set of symptoms can encompass several different conditions says\n\nnothing about the precise mix in the case at hand, let alone what\n\nother factors might suggest about the need for differentiation.\n\n            One can easily conjecture reasons why differentiating\n\nmight matter; the most obvious is the relative urgency of the\n\nsurgery. The surgery itself would also differ, but it appears from\n\ntestimony that this would likely be determined definitively during\n\nthe preliminary steps of the surgery itself rather than by the\n\nstain test.     Absent an expert witness, however, it would be hard\n\nfor the jury to know anything about relative urgency or any need\n\nfor    differentiation   on   some   other      basis--let   alone   how   the\n\npatient's specific symptoms or the slide results in this case might\n\nbear upon the question.\n\n            We have, as required in a summary judgment case, drawn\n\nreasonable inferences in the favor of the plaintiffs as the parties\n\nresisting the judgment, Faiola v. APCO Graphics, Inc., 629 F.3d 43,\n\n45 (1st Cir. 2010), but the outcome does not turn on evaluating the\n\nevidence under a reasonable jury standard. Rather, the appeal fails\n\nbecause there is a legal rule requiring expert testimony in a case\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fof this character, and possible exceptions to the rule have not been\n\nshown to apply.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed. Each side\n\nis to bear its own costs on the appeal.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

Now mistrusting Puerto Rico physicians, they\n\nresorted at great expense to health care in the continental United\n\nStates, which their health insurer refused to cover.\n\n           On    August    29,   2007,   Dr.    Shellenberger     successfully\n\noperated   on    Rodríguez-Díaz,    surgically      removing    the    malignant\n\ntumor.   The attendant pathology confirmed the revised diagnosis of\n\na malignant tumor.     Within the year, on August 8, 2008, Rodríguez-\n\nDíaz and her husband brought this malpractice action in federal\n\ndistrict court in Puerto Rico against Dr. Rodríguez and his medical\n\ninsurer.    Having    become     residents     of   Florida,    they    premised\n\njurisdiction on diversity.        Their claim was that Dr. Rodríguez had\n\nbeen negligent in failing to conduct a differential diagnosis.\n\n           During discovery, Dr. Rodríguez stated that he had not\n\nconducted a differential diagnosis because the evidence that he\n\ndiscerned in studying the biopsy slide and described in his report\n\n(specifically,     myxoid stroma, epithelioid cells, and plasmacytoid\n\ncells) persuaded him that Rodríguez-Díaz suffered from a benign\n\ntumor,   making    unnecessary     any    differential     diagnosis.       The\n\ndefendants thereafter moved for summary judgment. Their supporting\n\nevidence went considerably beyond Dr. Rodríguez's explanation.\n\n           The    defense    offered     by    expert   witness   report    and\n\ndeposition testimony that the treatment for pleomorphic adenoma--\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fwhich can become malignant--and low grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma\n\nare the same; that Rodríguez-Díaz had received the appropriate\n\ntreatment in sufficient time; that an Orlando specialist had in\n\nJuly 2007 reviewed the same slides and made no diagnosis of\n\nmalignancy; and that no definitive diagnosis could be made until\n\nsurgery.\n\n            In opposition, Rodríguez-Díaz offered no expert testimony\n\non the standard of care.     She relied primarily on the failure of\n\nDr. Rodríguez to conduct a differential diagnosis and thus to\n\nconsider low grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma as an alternative to\n\npleomorphic adenoma; on Dr. Carlo's use of the technique and the\n\nmucicarmine stain test in an attempt to exclude this alternative;\n\nand on Dr. Carlo's correct diagnosis and its confirmation after\n\nsurgery.    Rodríguez-Díaz made no claim of physical harm from the\n\ndelay in surgery but did claim emotional distress and increased\n\nexpenses due to her concern about medical care in Puerto Rico.\n\n            On September 22, 2009, the district court granted the\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment, ruling that the plaintiffs\n\ncould not establish a prima facie claim of medical malpractice\n\nunder Article 1802 because they had not offered expert evidence\n\nestablishing the relevant standard of care.

The fact that Dr.\n\nCarlo conducted a differential diagnosis in this case, and that its\n\napplication led to the correct diagnosis, does not show that\n\nfailing to use it was negligent.

This hardly disproves the plaintiffs' claim:\n\ndoctors, especially in tightknit communities, may be hesitant to\n\naccuse each other; pathology is a specialized field which could\n\nfurther narrow the supply of experts; and although experts can\n\nusually be found somewhere at some price, the lack of physical\n\ninjury here likely limited what the plaintiffs could promise to\n\npay.\n\n               Plaintiffs' counsel made an admirable effort to do his\n\nown medical research.           He cited both in the district court and on\n\nthis       appeal    a   2002   study   in   a   medical   periodical      for   the\n\nproposition that low grade carcinoma is one of the differential\n\ndiagnoses of pleomorphic adenoma.2               Yet he has not argued directly\n\nthat this article, standing by itself, would allow the jury to\n\nconclude that every pleomorphic adenoma requires for proper medical\n\ntreatment a differential diagnosis or the mucicarmine stain test.\n\n               We think that the implicit concession is warranted.               The\n\narticle      is     highly   technical--even      to   understand   much    of   the\n\n\n       2\n      Stanley, Selected Problems in Fine Needle Aspiration of Head\nand Neck Masses, 15 Modern Pathology 342 (2002). He also cited\nliterature to support the view that, where mucin is present, a\ndefinitive judgment should be deferred pending further testing, see\nJacobs, Low Grade Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma ex Pleomorphic Adenoma,\n38 Acta Cytologica 93 (1994), but such literature is of no help in\nestablishing when proper care requires the test to identify mucin.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fterminology would require a medical dictionary and probably some\n\nscience--and nowhere does it contain a flat statement that in every\n\ncase    where   pleomorphic   adenoma      is   diagnosed    a   differential\n\ndiagnosis or the mucicarmine stain test is required.             To say that\n\na set of symptoms can encompass several different conditions says\n\nnothing about the precise mix in the case at hand, let alone what\n\nother factors might suggest about the need for differentiation.\n\n            One can easily conjecture reasons why differentiating\n\nmight matter; the most obvious is the relative urgency of the\n\nsurgery. The surgery itself would also differ, but it appears from\n\ntestimony that this would likely be determined definitively during\n\nthe preliminary steps of the surgery itself rather than by the\n\nstain test.     Absent an expert witness, however, it would be hard\n\nfor the jury to know anything about relative urgency or any need\n\nfor    differentiation   on   some   other      basis--let   alone   how   the\n\npatient's specific symptoms or the slide results in this case might\n\nbear upon the question.\n\n            We have, as required in a summary judgment case, drawn\n\nreasonable inferences in the favor of the plaintiffs as the parties\n\nresisting the judgment, Faiola v.
