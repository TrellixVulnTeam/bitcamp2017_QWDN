Petitioners Siti Maryam and Jamal\n\nHaji   Giling,1    a     married    couple,       are   natives    and    citizens      of\n\nIndonesia.        They    seek     review    of    an    order    of     the    Board   of\n\nImmigration       Appeals    (BIA)     denying          their    motion        to   reopen\n\nproceedings to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Because the\n\nBIA's decision did not constitute an abuse of discretion, we deny\n\nthe petition for review.\n\n                                            I.\n\n           Petitioners entered the United States with visitors'\n\nvisas.    Each petitioner's permission to remain in the country\n\nexpired, and on August 13, 2001, removal proceedings against\n\npetitioners were initiated by the filing of Notices to Appear.\n\nPetitioners were charged with removability for remaining longer\n\nthan permitted following admission as nonimmigrants.                       On November\n\n1, 2001, petitioners conceded removability, but sought asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.                          On May 14,\n\n2002, there was a hearing on these requests for relief.                             The IJ\n\npretermitted      petitioners'       application        for     asylum   as     untimely.\n\nFinding that the Indonesian government did not sanction persecution\n\nof ethnic Chinese persons -- a class of which petitioner Maryam is\n\n\n\n1\n    The record is inconsistent on the spelling of the latter\npetitioner's name.

Petitioners\n\npetitioned this court for review of that summary affirmance, but\n\ntheir petition was barred as untimely.\n\n           On October 12, 2004, petitioners filed a motion to reopen\n\nwith the BIA.   They argued that reopening was appropriate in light\n\nof changed circumstances in Indonesia.         In particular, petitioners\n\nargued that Indonesia had seen growing violence by extremist\n\nMuslims against Christians, and that as moderate Muslims, they\n\nwould be in danger if they returned.\n\n           The BIA denied the motion to reopen on February 10, 2005.\n\nIt found that petitioners had failed to show a change in country\n\nconditions that materially affected their claim for asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal.      The BIA noted that most of petitioners'\n\nevidence went to violence against Christians; that to the extent\n\nthe evidence pertained to violence against Muslims, it showed only\n\nisolated events that did not target mosques or moderate Muslims\n\n(for   instance,   some   Muslims   were    \"indirectly   injured\"      during\n\nattacks on Christian churches); that the rise -- if any -- of\n\nIslamic norms in Indonesian civil society had not been shown to\n\nconstitute   persecution     against       moderate   Muslims;    and    that\n\ngeneralized disorder or violence in Indonesia did not constitute\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fgrounds for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the\n\nCAT. The BIA also noted that the Indonesian government was engaged\n\nin efforts to reduce religious conflict.\n\n            Following      the   denial     of    their   request   to    reopen,\n\npetitioners timely filed this petition for review.2\n\n                                      II.\n\n            A motion to reopen \"shall state the new facts that will\n\nbe proven at a hearing\" and \"shall not be granted unless it appears\n\nto the [BIA] that evidence sought to be offered is material and was\n\nnot available and could not have been discovered or presented at\n\nthe former hearing.\"          8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).            One basis for\n\nreopening       is     changed   country         circumstances.          See    id.\n\n§ 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); see also id. § 1208.4(a)(4)(i)(A) (defining\n\n\"changed circumstances\" to include \"[c]hanges in conditions in the\n\napplicant's country of nationality\" that \"materially affect[] the\n\napplicant's eligibility for asylum\").\n\n            The BIA may deny a motion to reopen on the grounds that\n\n\"the   movant    has    not   established    a    prima   facie   case    for   the\n\nunderlying substantive relief sought.\"              INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94,\n\n2\n  In their motion to reopen, petitioners also alleged ineffective\nassistance of former counsel and requested that, based on this\nineffective assistance, the BIA either reopen the proceedings or\nreissue its November 28, 2003 order.     In its February 10, 2005\norder, the BIA denied this request.    In their petition to this\ncourt, petitioners have raised neither the ineffective assistance\nclaim nor the rejection of their request to reissue. We therefore\nconsider only the BIA's denial of petitioners' motion to reopen in\nlight of changed circumstances.\n\n                                      -4-\n\f104 (1988).3    \"The decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen .\n\n. . is within the discretion of the [BIA],\" and the BIA \"has\n\ndiscretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has\n\nmade out a prima facie case for relief.\"                 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).\n\n           This Court reviews a decision by the BIA to deny a motion\n\nto reopen only for abuse of discretion.             See Abudu, 485 U.S. at 96;\n\nMaindrond v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 98, 100 (1st Cir. 2004).                  \"An abuse\n\nof discretion will be found where the BIA misinterprets the law, or\n\nacts either arbitrarily or capriciously.\"                 Wang v. Ashcroft, 367\n\nF.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 2004).          Petitioners claim that the BIA abused\n\nits   discretion       by   failing     to   analyze    properly    the   evidence\n\nsupporting     their    claim    that    \"country      conditions   for   moderate\n\nMuslims had worsened.\"          We disagree.\n\n           The BIA thoroughly reviewed the evidence offered to show\n\npersecution and carefully -- and correctly -- explained how this\n\nevidence failed to show a \"material change in circumstances which\n\n\n\n3\n     Applicants for asylum have the burden of establishing\neligibility, which they may do by, inter alia, showing a well-\nfounded fear of persecution on account of one of five protected\ngrounds -- \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\nsocial group, or political opinion.\"       8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a),\n(b)(2)(i)(A).   As for withholding of removal, \"[t]he burden of\nproof is on the applicant . . . to establish that his or her life\nor freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal\"\non account of one of the five protected grounds. Id. § 1208.16(b);\nsee also 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A), (C). Lastly, with respect to\nprotection under the CAT, \"[t]he burden of proof is on the\napplicant . . . to establish that it is more likely than not that\nhe or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of\nremoval.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2).\n\n                                         -5-\n\festablishes prima facie evidence of persecution . . . on account of\n\na protected ground.\" Contrary to petitioners' suggestions, the BIA\n\ndid not fail to discuss \"background evidence that post-dated the\n\npetitioners' hearing\"; rather, it acknowledged this evidence but\n\nfound it insufficient to support their claim that they would be\n\npersecuted on the basis of their religious beliefs should they\n\nreturn to Indonesia.4\n\n          The   BIA   reasonably   found   that   the   record   contained\n\nessentially no direct evidence of persecution of moderate Muslims,\n\nand that any indirect evidence, based on persecution of Christians,\n\nwas too attenuated to be the basis of relief.       In petitioners' own\n\nsummary of the evidence in their brief to this court, virtually all\n\nof the even arguably state-sanctioned violence is targeted at\n\nChristians.     Although this violence may well be \"a matter of\n\ngrowing concern to . . . Muslim moderates,\" the BIA was hardly\n\ncompelled to find that this concern stemmed from a risk of actual\n\npersecution of moderate Muslims themselves.       The \"growing concern\"\n\nof moderate Muslims could be attributable to humanitarian values,\n\n\n\n4\n   The government notes that petitioners largely failed to show\nthat the conditions they described were new.          Although the\ngovernment might be correct that much of petitioners' evidence of\nviolent conditions in Indonesia predated the May 14, 2002 hearing\nand decision by the IJ, this fact was not relied upon by the BIA in\nits denial of reopening. Rather, the BIA based its decision upon\nthe ground that even if petitioners had proven a change in country\ncircumstances, that change was immaterial to their own applications\nfor relief. As we explain in the text, this conclusion was amply\njustified.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fthe desire to avoid becoming the accidental victim of an attack on\n\nChristians, or any number of other causes.        At least in the absence\n\nof more evidence on this point, it is simply not evident how any\n\nescalation of violence against Christians could be material to a\n\nclaim of persecution raised by moderate Muslims.              To the extent\n\nthat Islamic fundamentalism is on the rise in Indonesia, it is\n\nlikewise not obvious how, if at all, moderate Muslims are likely to\n\nbe   persecuted.       At   best,   petitioners   have      shown   religious\n\nintolerance against non-Muslims -- intolerance that, as the BIA\n\nnoted, the Indonesian government is taking steps to counteract.\n\n            Lastly, the BIA correctly noted that petitioners' showing\n\nof generalized disorder and even terrorist violence in Indonesia is\n\ninsufficient to make them eligible for relief.             As this court has\n\nstated, \"[g]enerally, evidence of widespread violence and human\n\nrights    violations   affecting    all    citizens   is    insufficient   to\n\nestablish persecution.\"       Debab v. INS, 163 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (quoting Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 759 (1st Cir.\n\n1992)).   See also Meguenine v. INS, 139 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(\"[G]eneral fears (even 'well-founded' ones) of future harm from\n\npolitical upheaval or terrorist violence are not sufficient to\n\nestablish eligibility for asylum under § 208(a) of the [Immigration\n\nand Nationality Act].\").\n\n     It is clear that the BIA's well-reasoned decision was anything\n\nbut arbitrary and capricious.         Cf. Maindrond, 385 F.3d at 100\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f(\"Since the BIA offered two rational explanations for the denial of\n\nthe   motion   to   reopen,   it   has    not   acted   arbitrarily   and\n\ncapriciously, and there was no abuse of discretion.\").\n\n                                   III.\n\n      Because the BIA's denial of petitioners' motion to reopen was\n\nnot an abuse of discretion, the petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f",

Each petitioner's permission to remain in the country expired, and on August 13, 2001, removal proceedings against petitioners were initiated by the filing of Notices to Appear. Petitioners were charged with removability for remaining longer than permitted following admission as nonimmigrants. On November 1, 2001, petitioners conceded removability, but sought asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. On May 14, 2002, there was a hearing on these requests for relief. The IJ pretermitted petitioners' application for asylum as untimely. Finding that the Indonesian government did not sanction persecution of ethnic Chinese persons &#8212; a class of which petitioner Maryam is a member &#8212; the IJ also denied their applications for withholding of removal and for protection under the CAT.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners timely appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA.

It found that petitioners had failed to show a change in country conditions that materially affected their claim for asylum and withholding of removal. The BIA noted that most of petitioners' evidence went to violence against Christians; that to the extent the evidence pertained to violence against Muslims, it showed only isolated events that did not target mosques or moderate Muslims (for instance, some Muslims were \"indirectly injured\" during attacks on Christian churches); that the rise &#8212; if any &#8212; of Islamic norms in Indonesian civil society had not been shown to constitute persecution against moderate Muslims; and that generalized disorder or violence in Indonesia did not constitute grounds for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the CAT.

In petitioners' own summary of the evidence in their brief to this court, virtually all of the even arguably state-sanctioned violence is targeted at Christians. Although this violence may well be \"a matter of growing concern to ... Muslim moderates,\" the BIA was hardly compelled to find that this concern stemmed from a risk of actual persecution of moderate Muslims themselves. The \"growing concern\" of moderate Muslims could be attributable to humanitarian values, the desire to avoid becoming the accidental victim of an attack on Christians, or any number of other causes. At least in the absence of more evidence on this point, it is simply not evident how any escalation of violence against Christians could be material to a claim of persecution raised by moderate Muslims. To the extent that Islamic fundamentalism is on the rise in Indonesia, it is likewise not obvious how, if at all, moderate Muslims are likely to be persecuted. At best, petitioners have shown religious intolerance against non-Muslims &#8212; intolerance that, as the BIA noted, the Indonesian government is taking steps to counteract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the BIA correctly noted that petitioners' showing of generalized disorder and even terrorist violence in Indonesia is insufficient to make them eligible for relief.
