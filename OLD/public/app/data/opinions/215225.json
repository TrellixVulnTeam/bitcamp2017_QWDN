Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n                  Torruella, Boudin and Lipez,\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Christopher M.

Richardson       with whom Boyajian, Harrington &\nRichardson was on brief for    appellee.\n\n\n\n                          April 21, 2011\n\f          Per Curiam.   Bruce Thunberg filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy\n\npetition in August 2000, 11 U.S.C. §§ 701-784 (2006), and Marc\n\nWallick was appointed trustee.    An order by the bankruptcy court\n\ndischarging Thunberg issued in December 2000, but in April 2002,\n\nthe trustee sought to revoke the discharge on the ground that it\n\nhad been procured by Thunberg's fraud.   Id. § 727(d)(2).   In August\n\n2009, the bankruptcy court revoked the discharge, and the district\n\ncourt affirmed.1   Thunberg now appeals from the revocation.\n\n          At issue is Thunberg's interest derived from a 1997\n\nsettlement agreement with his ex-wife incident to their divorce.\n\nThe settlement agreement specified that, each December for the next\n\n15 years, his former wife would pay Thunberg $30,000--$16,666.66\n\nbeing designated in the agreement as alimony and $13,333.33 being\n\ndesignated as a property settlement payment. Thunberg's bankruptcy\n\npetition listed the $160,000 over the remaining 12 years as a\n\nproperty settlement, asserting that it was subject to two liens,\n\nand listed the $1,333 per month in alimony as income.\n\n          Nevertheless, according to testimony accepted by the\n\nbankruptcy judge, Thunberg (or his lawyer with Thunberg remaining\n\nsilent) represented to the trustee that all the payments including\n\nthe alimony were subject to the liens; he accelerated by private\n\nagreement with his ex-wife two of the payments without advising the\n\n\n     1\n      Thunberg v. Wallick, CA. No. 09-419 S, 2010 WL 1838003\n(D.R.I. May 5, 2010); Wallick v. Thunberg (In re Thunberg), 413\nB.R. 20 (Bankr. D.R.I. 2009).\n\n                                 -2-\n\ftrustee or the court; he used funds from two sets of payments in\n\npart for private purposes; and--it turned out--the liens on which\n\nhe relied had not properly been perfected. The details are spelled\n\nout in the decisions of the bankruptcy and district courts and need\n\nnot be repeated.\n\n          Ultimately,    the   bankruptcy      court   revoked    Thunberg's\n\ndischarge,   agreeing   with   the   trustee    that   Thunberg    \"acquired\n\nproperty that is property of the estate . . . and knowingly and\n\nfraudulently failed to report the acquisition of or entitlement to\n\nsuch property, or to deliver or surrender such property to the\n\ntrustee,\" 11 U.S.C. § 727(d)(2); cf. Boroff v. Tully (In re Tully),\n\n818 F.2d 106, 110-12 (1st Cir. 1987).          The district court wrote a\n\ncogent decision upholding the revocation.\n\n          On appeal, Thunberg argues that his actions were at worst\n\nhonest mistakes.   We agree that Thunberg largely avoided explicit\n\nfalse statements and that the finding of fraudulent intent depends\n\nin part on seeing a pattern of evasion and silence in the face of\n\nculpable knowledge and in part on inferences drawn from Thunberg's\n\nconduct. But the perception and inferences are rational, and there\n\nis nothing close to clear error, which is the test on review of\n\nfactual findings, Gannett v. Carp (In re Carp), 340 F.3d 15, 21\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          Thunberg says that the bankruptcy court's understanding\n\nwas flawed by a mistaken belief that no security interests covered\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthe payments; this is doubtful, but in any event Thunberg allowed\n\nthe trustee and the court to believe that he was turning over\n\nwhatever he received to secured creditors, which was not true, and\n\nhe   withheld   knowledge   of   the    accelerated   payments.   Further\n\npayments to the estate shortly before the trial did not undo\n\nThunberg's earlier conduct and omissions.         Olsen v. Reese (In re\n\nReese), 203 B.R. 425, 431-32 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1997).\n\n           Thunberg also suggests (1) that the bankruptcy judge\n\nconflated the standard for denying a discharge with that for\n\nrevoking a discharge and (2) that the factual inferences drawn do\n\nnot support a holding of deliberate misconduct.              There is no\n\nindication of the former; and, as to the latter, the ultimate\n\nfindings met the statutory standard for revoking a discharge, and\n\nthe factual inferences drawn were reasonable.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f",
