George Z.

Curhan for appellant.\n     David G. Webbert, Johnson & Webbert, LLP, Stephen A. Roach,\nand Roach & Wise, LLP, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           December 19, 2003\n\n\n\n    *\n      Of the United States District Court for the District of\nColumbia, sitting by designation.\n\f              Per Curiam.       Jacquelyn Quint commenced a civil action\n\nagainst her employer, A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co., alleging\n\nemployment discrimination based on disability.                    Following a jury\n\ntrial,   an    appeal,    and    a    settlement       following    remand,   Quint\n\nrecovered a $485,000 award for back pay, compensatory damages, and\n\nfuture wages.      See Quint v. A.E. Staley Mfg. Co., 172 F.3d 1 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).      At issue in the instant appeal are the fees received\n\nby two attorneys Quint retained to litigate her case.                     Attorney\n\nDavid Webbert accepted Quint's case pursuant to a contingent fee\n\nagreement, wherein he agreed (i) to accept a 25% contingency fee,\n\nrather than his customary 40% contingency fee, as well as any\n\nstatutory fees awarded Quint under the pertinent fee-shifting\n\nstatute.       Attorney     Stephen       Roach   in    turn    negotiated    a   15%\n\ncontingency      fee,    plus    statutory        fees.        Attorney   Webbert's\n\ncontingent fee award amounted to $156,079.80; Attorney Roach's\n\ncontingent fee award came to $80,648.42. Finally, Attorney Webbert\n\nwas   awarded     $99,363.69         in   statutory       fees;    Attorney   Roach\n\n$52,811.92.      Quint v. A.E. Staley Mfg. Co., 245 F. Supp. 2d 162,\n\n182 (D. Me. 2003).\n\n              Quint contends on appeal that the district court erred in\n\ndeclining to reduce (i.e., offset) the contingent fees, awarded to\n\nher former attorneys, by the amount of the statutory fees they\n\nreceived, and that the fee award unfairly accorded Webbert and\n\nRoach “windfall” compensation exceeding their customary hourly\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\frates.   Quint's contentions fail.\n\n           First,    unlike   statutory    fees,       which     normally   are\n\ndelimited to “reasonable” compensation, fee awards predicated upon\n\nfee agreements privately negotiated between attorney and client are\n\nreviewed more deferentially; in the sense that we will exercise our\n\nsupervisory power to reduce a fee award predicated upon a fee\n\nagreement only in those “exceptional circumstances” where the fee\n\nassessed by counsel is “unethically excessive.” Sargeant v. Sharp,\n\n579 F.2d 645, 648 n.4 (1st Cir. 1978); see Gobert v. Williams, 323\n\nF.3d 1099, 1100 (5th Cir. 2003) (“‘[T]here is nothing in [the fee-\n\nshifting statute] to regulate what plaintiffs may or may not\n\npromise to pay their attorneys [in contingent fees] if they lose or\n\nif they win.’”) (quoting Venegas v. Mitchell, 495 U.S. 82, 87-88\n\n(1990)).\n\n           The record on appeal in the instant case discloses no\n\nsuch exceptional circumstances.         At the time she retained her\n\nformer attorneys, Quint voluntarily agreed not only to compensate\n\nthem with a substantially lower contingent fee, but to assign them\n\nher rights to any statutory fees as well.               The record further\n\nreveals that Attorney Webbert's able representation enabled Quint\n\nto surmount several significant legal obstacles – such as Quint’s\n\nconceded   failure    to   mitigate     damages    –     which     contributed\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fsubstantially to Quint’s $485,000 recovery.1    In turn, Attorney\n\nRoach skillfully prosecuted the first appeal Quint brought before\n\nthis court, and succeeded not only in increasing the back-pay award\n\nto Quint, from $8,000 to $46,000, but in securing a remand to the\n\ndistrict court to adjudicate her previously dismissed reinstatement\n\nclaim, which ultimately garnered Quint an additional $100,000.   As\n\nthe record on appeal plainly discloses, the instant appeal is\n\nutterly meritless.\n\n           Affirmed; double costs are awarded to the appellee.   SO\n\nORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Attorney Webbert acknowledges on appeal that, were he to\nreceive litigation expenses as part of his statutory and contingent\nfee awards, he might be realizing an impermissible double recovery\nof litigation expenses. In reliance upon Webbert’s representation\nto us that he will eschew such double reimbursement (if any), we\naffirm, subject to the district court’s prerogative to revisit this\naspect of the fee award should Webbert fail to honor this\nrepresentation.\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
