The   district    court\n\nbifurcated an action but, after the first-phase trial had been\n\ncompleted, misinterpreted the effect of the jury's verdict.                  That\n\nerror prompted a series of rulings which, among other things,\n\nforeclosed a second-phase trial.                  Because these rulings were\n\nerroneous and prejudiced substantial rights, we reverse one order,\n\nvacate another, and remand for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion and with Puerto Rico law governing the allocation of\n\ndamages between settling and non-settling successive tortfeasors.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            Edward and Myrella Fiorentino sojourned from Arizona to\n\nPuerto Rico to stay at the Westin Río Mar Beach Hotel.                 On December\n\n7, 2000, while swimming in the ocean, Edward was struck by a wave\n\nwhich   rendered       him    unconscious.          Following   his    shore-side\n\nresuscitation     by    a    group   of    vacationing    doctors,     lifeguards\n\nrealized that they lacked proper equipment for stabilization. When\n\nemergency    medical        personnel     finally    arrived,   they    placed   a\n\nsupportive collar around Edward's neck and transported him to the\n\nHospital San Pablo del Este (the Hospital).\n\n            Although a scan taken that same day indicated that a\n\ncervical vertebra had been broken, the medical staff failed to\n\ntreat the fracture. In the meantime, fragments pressed on Edward's\n\nspinal cord, causing swelling and nerve damage.                 Myrella had him\n\ntransferred to a hospital in Miami but, despite prompt surgical\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fintervention      there,        Edward    emerged     from     his    ordeal    as    a\n\nquadriplegic.\n\n            Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1),\n\nthe Fiorentinos filed suit in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico against the hotel and the entity that\n\nowned it (collectively, the Hotel) and against the Hospital.                        With\n\nrespect to the Hotel, the amended complaint alleged negligent\n\nfailure   to     warn   of    hazardous     beach    conditions       and    negligent\n\nentrustment      of     beach    safety    to     untrained     and    ill-equipped\n\nlifeguards.      With respect to the Hospital, the amended complaint\n\nalleged, among other things, medical malpractice.\n\n            Edward died before trial for reasons unconnected with the\n\naccident.      His wife, as personal representative of his estate and\n\nin her own behalf, pressed forward with the suit (accordingly, we\n\nhenceforth refer to her singularly as the plaintiff).                       Meanwhile,\n\nthe Hotel and the Hospital filed cross-claims against each other.\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(g).\n\n            As    trial      approached,    the     Hospital    settled      with    the\n\nplaintiff for $1,400,000, and the district court granted a motion\n\nto dismiss the amended complaint as to that defendant. The Hotel's\n\ncross-claim remained pending.             The court proceeded effectively to\n\nbifurcate what remained of the action, reserving the cross-claim\n\nfor a separate trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f           Before the first-phase trial commenced, the Hotel moved\n\nto compel disclosure of the release, settlement agreement, and\n\nrelated documents (collectively, the Release) memorializing the\n\nsettlement between the plaintiff and the Hospital.         The plaintiff\n\nopposed   the   motion.   The   court   did   not   act   on   the   matter\n\nimmediately, and the first-phase trial got underway.\n\n           The trial itself showcased the plaintiff's claims against\n\nthe Hotel (the Hospital did not participate).             At the charge\n\nconference, the judge reiterated how he had decided to structure\n\nthe proceedings, advising the Hotel that it could \"repeat against\n\nthe hospital\" in the second-phase trial all claims \"for any damages\n\nthat the hospital may have caused.\"      The judge then stated:\n\n           Basically, what I have done in this case is .\n           . . a bifurcation. I have tried plaintiffs'\n           causes of action against the hotel first.\n           Once that is over, if there is any reason to\n           go forward with [the] cross claim against the\n           hospital, then we'll have another jury trial,\n           and we'll go [forward with the] cross claim\n           against the hospital.\n\nLater that day, the court charged the jury. Pertinently, the court\n\ninstructed:\n\n                A person who by his negligence causes\n           physical   injuries    to   another  is   also\n           responsible   for   any   additional  injuries\n           suffered by that person as a result of the\n           medical services provided to treat the\n           original injuries.      Nothing precludes the\n           person who caused the original injuries to\n           recover from the hospital who provided the\n           medical services those additional injuries\n           caused by their insufficient care.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f                 If you find that the [Hotel] defendants .\n            . . are responsible for Mr. Fiorentino's\n            accident on December 7, 2000, you must also\n            determine that they are liable for all damages\n            sustained by him as a consequence of the\n            medical services provided to him to treat the\n            physical injuries suffered at the beach of the\n            Westin Río Mar Beach Hotel . . . .\n\nAfter deliberations, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the\n\nplaintiff in the amount of $1,844,000.\n\n            The    district    court   subsequently          granted     the   Hotel's\n\npending motion for disclosure of the Release.                   When produced, the\n\nsettlement accord proved to be fashioned along the lines of a\n\nPierringer release.      See Pierringer v. Hoger, 124 N.W.2d 106, 112\n\n(Wis.   1963)     (interpreting    such      a     release    as    discharging       the\n\nsettling    defendant    entirely      and       discharging       the   non-settling\n\ndefendant    from    responsibility          for    the      settling     defendant's\n\nproportionate share of liability).                  Such \"proportionate share\"\n\nreleases are not uncommon.         See, e.g., McDermott v. AmCLYDE, 511\n\nU.S. 202, 205, 217 (1994); In re Exxon Valdez, 229 F.3d 790, 797-98\n\n(9th Cir. 2000); Austin v. Raymark Indus., Inc., 841 F.2d 1184,\n\n1188-91 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n            The Release purported not only to free the Hospital from\n\nany   and   all   further     liability      to    the    plaintiff      but   also    to\n\ndischarge it from liability for any associated third-party claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fAn additional provision in the Release assured the Hospital of\n\nindemnification should any such claim be pressed.2\n\n             Armed with the Release, the Hotel filed a flurry of post-\n\ntrial motions, including a motion for a new trial, see Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 59(a), and a motion to alter or amend the verdict by, say, a\n\ndollar-for-dollar setoff of the settlement amount, see Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 59(e).     The district court denied both motions.     The court's\n\nrejection of the new trial motion is not seriously disputed on\n\nappeal. With respect to the Rule 59(e) motion, the court expressed\n\na belief that the Hotel, in filing it, had misconstrued the import\n\nof the jury's verdict.     The court wrote:\n\n                  During the trial, the jury was only\n             considering [the Hotel's] participation in the\n             event that caused plaintiff's damages.     The\n             only defendant at trial was [the Hotel]. The\n             evidence that was presented pertained to [the\n             Hotel's] negligence and involvement in the\n             events leading to plaintiff's injury.      The\n             jury was instructed to consider the damages\n             only as to [the Hotel] . . . .      Therefore,\n             this is not a situation of double recovery\n             because the jury was only considering the\n             damages as to [the Hotel].\n\n\n\n\n     2\n         Specifically the Release stated:\n\n          Plaintiffs shall indemnify and hold harmless the\n     settling Defendants . . . from and against all claims,\n     damages, and losses arising out of any claim made by an\n     entity to recover any amounts from the settling\n     Defendants which arise out of the incident alleged in the\n     Complaint, including any claims for medical expenses and\n     any and all claims for subrogation.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fIn line with this understanding, the court entered judgment against\n\nthe Hotel for the total amount of the verdict, denied its motion\n\nfor a setoff, and dismissed its cross-claim.   These timely appeals\n\nensued.\n\n II.   ANALYSIS\n\n           Our analysis is divided into three parts.    We begin by\n\naddressing the district court's rulings during the proceedings that\n\nfollowed the first-phase trial.    We then canvass the case law to\n\ndetermine the proper allocation of damages between settling and\n\nnon-settling tortfeasors in a successive tortfeasor case governed\n\nby Puerto Rico law.      Lastly, we turn to the remedy for the\n\ndiscerned error and furnish a roadmap for further proceedings.\n\n                    A.   The Post-Trial Rulings.\n\n           In the final analysis, the Hotel's assignments of error\n\nhinge upon the contention that the district court misconstrued the\n\nlegal import of the first-phase verdict — a misconception that it\n\nsays tainted the post-trial rulings.    The most critical of those\n\nrulings was made in connection with the Rule 59(e) motion.\n\n           Ordinarily, we review a district court's disposition of\n\na Rule 59(e) motion for abuse of discretion.       See Vasapolli v.\n\nRostoff, 39 F.3d 27, 36 (1st Cir. 1994).       But this is not the\n\nordinary circumstance.   Where, as here, the disposition of a Rule\n\n59(e) motion depends entirely on a question of law, our review is\n\nplenary.   See Pérez v. Volvo Car Corp., 247 F.3d 303, 319 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f2001); see also Charlesbank Equity Fund II v. Blinds to Go, Inc.,\n\n370 F.3d 151, 158 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"An error of law is, of course,\n\nalways an abuse of discretion.\").     Since the cross-claim is at\n\nbottom a legal claim like any other, its dismissal is examined\n\nunder the de novo standard of review.        See Ruiz v. Bally Total\n\nFitness Holding Corp., 496 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2007); see also\n\nUnited States v. Hardage, 985 F.2d 1427, 1433 (10th Cir. 1993)\n\n(applying de novo standard to lower court's dismissal of cross-\n\nclaim).\n\n          The underlying legal question is nuanced, and it is\n\nunderstandable why the able district judge struggled with it.     We\n\nhave the luxury of time and, after careful consideration of the\n\nrecord, we conclude that both the district court's disposition of\n\nthe Rule 59(e) motion and its concomitant dismissal of the cross-\n\nclaim rest upon an incorrect interpretation of the effect of the\n\nfirst-phase verdict.   We elaborate below.\n\n          The jury instruction, quoted above, scarcely could have\n\nbeen more lucid in its exposition of an uncontroversial rule of\n\nPuerto Rico tort law: that tortfeasors must answer not only for the\n\ndamages immediately caused by their own negligence but also for any\n\nforeseeable aggravation thereof caused by the subsequent negligence\n\nof others. See Corey Lanuza v. Medic Emerg. Specialties, Inc., 229\n\nF. Supp. 2d 92, 100 (D.P.R. 2002) (\"A person is responsible not\n\nonly for those damages directly caused by his or her own negligence\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fbut also for the aggravation of injuries brought about by the\n\nnegligence of a third party in the course of providing medical\n\ntreatment.\"); Merced v. Gobierno de la Capital, 85 D.P.R. 552, 556-\n\n57 (P.R. 1962) (same).      No one claims that this instruction is an\n\nincorrect statement of law, nor is there the slightest reason to\n\nbelieve that the jury did not scrupulously adhere to it.            In any\n\nevent,     jurors    are   presumed    to    follow   the   trial   court's\n\ninstructions.       See Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 206 (1987);\n\nUnited States v. Sampson, 486 F.3d 13, 39 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            The district court's explanation of how the instruction\n\nfunctioned, quoted above, was accurate.               The court, however,\n\nappears to have misconceived the import of the ensuing verdict.\n\nApplying the instruction to the facts of this case, the verdict\n\nmust be presumed to have encompassed all the damages caused by both\n\nthe Hotel and the Hospital.      But the district court seems to have\n\nconstrued this fact as equivalent to a finding that the Hospital\n\nbore no responsibility for any part of those damages.          That is not\n\ncorrect.\n\n            Seeking to avoid the inevitable result of this reasoning,\n\nthe appellees asseverate that the Hotel failed to interpose a\n\ntimely objection to the instruction, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(d)(2),\n\nand that, therefore, the claim of error is forfeit. The appellees'\n\npremise is sound — no such contemporaneous objection was lodged —\n\nbut the conclusion that the appellees draw is insupportable.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f          The Hotel has not challenged the instruction itself\n\n(indeed, as we have said, no party has identified any flaw in the\n\ninstruction).     The challenge here concerns the district court's\n\ninterpretation of the effect of that instruction — no more and no\n\nless.   That interpretation did not emerge until after the first-\n\nphase verdict had been returned.\n\n          In such a situation, demanding that a party object at the\n\nconclusion of the charge in order to preserve its rights would be\n\ntantamount   to   demanding   that   a   party   anticipate   a   future\n\nhermeneutic misstep on the part of the trial court.       The law does\n\nnot require parties to possess that degree of clairvoyance.         Cf.\n\nUnited States v. Ladd, 885 F.2d 954, 961 (1st Cir. 1989) (remarking\n\nthat \"robes and gavels are the tools of a jurist's trade — not tea\n\nleaves or crystal balls\").\n\n          In an effort to dilute the force of the district court's\n\ninterpretive bevue, the appellees emphasize a number of facts (such\n\nas expert testimony that Edward's fracture was so severe that it\n\nmight have rendered him a quadriplegic even if he had received the\n\nbest of care thereafter) suggesting that the jury might have\n\nconcluded that the Hotel was to be held responsible only for the\n\ndirect consequences of its own negligence.       Taken to its logical\n\nconclusion, this argument suggests that the jury might have awarded\n\n$1,844,000 even while excluding from the amount awarded any damages\n\nflowing from shortcomings in Edward's care at the Hospital.\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f           That is not enough to render the court's error harmless.\n\nThe possibility that the jury could have followed such a path, as\n\nopposed to persuasive evidence that the jury actually did so, is\n\ninsufficient to overcome the Hotel's presumptive right to pursue\n\nits cross-claim and motion for setoff.              See United States v.\n\nCarney,   387   F.3d   436,   449   (6th   Cir.    2004)   (observing   that\n\n\"speculation, conjecture, empty hypothesizing, creative guesswork,\n\nand wishful thinking\" are insufficient to overcome presumption);\n\nBreeden v. ABF Freight Sys., Inc., 115 F.3d 749, 753-54 (10th Cir.\n\n1997) (holding in multiple defendant tort context that presumption\n\nwas not overcome by mere speculation that jury ignored specific\n\ninstruction).\n\n           To say more on this point would be supererogatory.            We\n\nconclude that the district court erred as a matter of law in its\n\nassessment of the effect of its own instruction and, thus, erred in\n\nits interpretation of what the first-phase verdict signified.\n\nUnder the instruction as given, the award encompassed both the\n\ndamages attributable to the Hotel's beachfront negligence and the\n\naggravating     damages   attributable     to     the   Hospital's   alleged\n\nmalpractice. Consequently, the district court erred in foreclosing\n\nfurther litigation; the Hotel was entitled to some process by which\n\nit could test how the plaintiff's total damages — $1,844,000 —\n\nshould be allocated as between it and the Hospital.            The district\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fcourt should not have denied the Rule 59(e) motion or dismissed the\n\ncross-claim without pursuing that inquiry.\n\n                      B.    Allocation of Damages.\n\n           The Release, by its terms, purports to free the Hospital\n\nfrom any further obligations arising out of Edward's injuries.                   A\n\nquestion   nonetheless     remains   as     to    its   overall     effect.    The\n\nplaintiff and the Hospital cannot by contracting between themselves\n\ndeny a third party rights that the third party (here, the Hotel)\n\nenjoys under the law.        We must, therefore, go beyond the four\n\ncorners of the Release in order to determine the rights of the\n\nparties inter sese.\n\n           Simply   put,    the   pivotal        question    here   concerns   the\n\nallocation   of   damages    as   between         settling    and    non-settling\n\ntortfeasors in a successive tortfeasor case.                 Because this is an\n\naction brought under diversity jurisdiction, the appropriate rule\n\nmust be gleaned from Puerto Rico law, not federal law.                         See\n\nVillarini-García v. Hosp. del Maestro, 112 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n           The protagonists recommend different models for the rule\n\nof decision.      The appellees contend that the Hotel's right of\n\ncontribution is limited to that proportion of the award (if any)\n\nthat can be attributed to the Hospital's negligence.                  See Austin,\n\n841 F.2d at 1190 (collecting cases adhering to this \"proportionate\n\nshare\" view).     The Hotel argues instead that there should be a\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fdollar-for-dollar setoff of the settlement amount ($1,400,000)\n\nagainst   the    verdict   amount   ($1,844,000),     thus    limiting   its\n\nresponsibility to the balance ($444,000).            See, e.g., Brown v.\n\nUnited States, 838 F.2d 1157, 1161-62 (11th Cir. 1988) (applying\n\ndollar-for-dollar setoff paradigm); In re Piper Aircraft, 792 F.\n\nSupp. 1189, 1194 (N.D. Cal. 1992) (same).             Some jurisdictions\n\ndictate this choice by statute.         See, e.g., Neb. Rev. Stat. § 25-\n\n21, 185.11 (1992) (codifying \"proportionate share\" rule); N.Y. Gen.\n\nOblig.    §    15-108(a)   (McKinney     2008)   (entitling    non-settling\n\ndefendant to a setoff equal to the settlement amount or the\n\nsettling defendant's equitable share of liability, whichever proves\n\ngreater).     Puerto Rico has not enacted such a statute, so our task\n\nis to make an informed prophecy as to which of these rules the\n\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court would probably choose in a successive\n\ntortfeasor situation.       See Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 81\n\nF.3d 1148, 1151 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n              The case law is less than transparently clear.             One\n\npotentially useful precedent, much touted by the Hotel, is our\n\ndecision in Villarini-García.          There, we interpreted Puerto Rico\n\nlaw as favoring a dollar-for-dollar setoff in a case concerning\n\nvicarious liability. See Villarini-García, 112 F.3d at 8. In that\n\ncontext, a dollar-for-dollar setoff rule makes perfect sense; after\n\nall, when one tortfeasor is vicariously liable for the actions of\n\nanother, the same damages are by definition attributed to each of\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fthe two tortfeasors and the prevention of a double recovery is a\n\nparamount concern.   See id.\n\n           Another potentially useful precedent, much touted by the\n\nappellees, is the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision in Szendrey\n\nv. Hospicare, 158 D.P.R. 648 (P.R. 2003).        There, the court\n\nendorsed the concept of proportionate share setoffs in a case\n\ninvolving joint tortfeasors, one of whom had obtained a Pierringer\n\nrelease prior to trial.   See id. at 657; see also Toledo v. Hosp.\n\nNuestra Señora de la Guadalupe, 167 D.P.R. ___, ___, 2006 TSPR 47,\n\n2006 JTS 56 at 1115-17 (P.R. 2006) (reaffirming the Szendrey\n\napproach).\n\n           None of these cases directly controls the situation at\n\nhand.   Here, we are confronted with a multiple tortfeasor scenario\n\nthat does not fall precisely under either the rubric of vicarious\n\nliability or that of joint tortfeasor liability. Unlike Villarini-\n\nGarcía, in which the defendants' liability arose from the same\n\nconduct (one was vicariously liable for the other's acts and\n\nomissions through a master-servant relationship), the Hotel and the\n\nHospital are each alleged to have been guilty of independently\n\ntortious conduct.    And unlike Szendrey, in which each of the two\n\njoint tortfeasors directly contributed to the same harm, the harms\n\nfor which the Hotel and the Hospital are allegedly responsible\n\noverlap, but they are not congruent; while the Hotel became liable\n\nfor the entire bundle of harms (that is, its negligence made it\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fliable not only for the damages flowing immediately therefrom but\n\nalso    for    whatever     damages      were    caused   by    the   Hospital's\n\nindependently tortious conduct), the Hospital never became liable\n\nunder any theory for the entire bundle of harms (that is, it never\n\nbecame liable for the pre-hospitalization damages attributable\n\nexclusively to the Hotel's antecedent negligence).\n\n              This imbalance, which results from the operation of a\n\nspecial tort rule dealing with the aggravation of injuries, is\n\nimportant.         Both commentators and judges have recognized the\n\ndistinctive nature of this type of situation and have labeled\n\nparties     like    the    Hotel   and    the    Hospital      \"independent\"   or\n\n\"successive\" tortfeasors, thus distinguishing them from garden-\n\nvariety joint tortfeasors.         See, e.g., 6 Jerome H. Nates et al.,\n\nDamages in Tort Actions § 51.03[1][d] (2007); see also McInnis v.\n\nA.M.F., Inc., 765 F.2d 240, 250 n.10 (1st Cir. 1985).                    It is,\n\ntherefore,      apparent    that   successive      tortfeasor      liability   is\n\ndoctrinally distinct from joint tortfeasor liability.\n\n              We have considered these differences and have studied the\n\ntwo alternative approaches to possible setoffs.                 We believe that\n\nthe Puerto Rico Supreme Court would be more likely to employ\n\nSzendrey's proportionate share rule in a successive tortfeasor\n\ncase.   Our reasons are threefold.\n\n              In the first place, the analogue to a joint tortfeasor\n\nsituation      is    a    persuasive      one.       Easily      separable     and\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fdistinguishable tortious acts may be attributed to each tortfeasor.\n\nSee generally W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts §\n\n52, at 352 (5th ed. 1984).                Where successive tortfeasors are\n\nconcerned,   however,    the    initial      tortfeasor     is,    under   certain\n\ncircumstances,   accountable        for    tortious    conduct     of   the   later\n\ntortfeasor in order \"to ensure that a victim of negligence is not\n\nleft without recourse due to the inability to set apart the origin\n\nof the damages or to prove medical malpractice.\" Corey Lanuza, 229\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 101 (citing Merced, 85 D.P.R. at 557-58).                           A\n\nPierringer release executed with the second tortfeasor dissolves\n\nthis concern and molds the successive tortfeasor situation into one\n\nstrongly   resembling    a   joint    tortfeasor       situation     in    which   a\n\nPierringer   release    is     in   play    (that     is,   each   defendant       is\n\nultimately responsible only for its proportionate share of the\n\noverall damages).       See Austin, 841 F.2d at 1191; Szendrey, 158\n\nD.P.R. at 658-59.      The distinctions that exist between successive\n\ntortfeasors and tortfeasors who are linked only by principles of\n\nvicarious liability are, at one and the same time, much more stark\n\nand much less easily resolved.\n\n           Our two remaining reasons can be succinctly stated.\n\nFairly read, Szendrey seems to us to represent the default rule\n\nunder Puerto Rico law, which recognizes the settling parties'\n\nintent as controlling.       See Szendrey, 158 D.P.R. at 657-58 (\"This\n\nintention [to release the settling defendant from all liability] .\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f. . does not affect the cause of action asserted against the other\n\ncodefendants . . . insofar as it was so expressly agreed.\")\n\n(official translation, slip op. at 6).\n\n           Finally, Villarini-García was decided in 1997.            In our\n\nview, its reasoning has been colored, informed, and to some extent\n\nlimited by the later decision in Szendrey.          In this regard, it is\n\nespecially noteworthy that the Villarini-García court's focus on\n\nthe Puerto Rico courts' \"general hostility to double recovery,\"\n\n112 F.3d at 8, has been blurred by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's\n\nsubsequent selection of a proportionate setoff rule for joint\n\ntortfeasor cases despite the fact that, under this rule, plaintiffs\n\nmight   sometimes   receive   more    (or   less)   than   full    and    fair\n\ncompensation for their injuries.      See Szendrey, 158 D.P.R. at 658-\n\n59; see also Toledo, 167 D.P.R. at ___, 2006 TSPR 47, 2006 JTS 56\n\nat 1115-17 (affirming Szendrey).\n\n           These reasons lead us to conclude that in all likelihood\n\nthe Puerto Rico Supreme Court would find no meaningful difference\n\nbetween   successive   tortfeasors    and   joint   tortfeasors     for   the\n\npurpose of determining setoffs. Confirmation of this intuition can\n\nbe found in the fact that courts elsewhere tend to treat Pierringer\n\nreleases the same, whether the tortfeasors in question are joint or\n\nsuccessive.   Compare, e.g., Stueve v. Am. Honda Motors Co., 457 F.\n\nSupp. 740, 748-49 (D. Kan. 1978) (applying proportionate setoff in\n\nsuccessive    tortfeasor   context,   after   execution    of     Pierringer\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\frelease), and Hansen v. Crown Controls Corp., 512 N.W.2d 509, 513\n\nn.2, 514 (Wis. Ct. App. 1993) (similar), vacated in part on other\n\ngrounds, 519 N.W.2d 346, 346 (Wis. 1994), with, e.g., Nagunst v. W.\n\nUnion Tel. Co., 76 F.R.D. 631, 634-35 (D. Kan. 1977) (applying\n\nproportionate setoff in joint tortfeasor context, after execution\n\nof Pierringer release), and Johnson v. Misericordia Cmty. Hosp.,\n\n301 N.W.2d 156, 158 (Wis. 1981) (similar).         Legislatures have\n\ntended to do the same.    See, e.g., Iowa Code Ann. § 668.7 (West\n\n2007) (providing for proportionate setoff of settlements without\n\ndistinguishing between joint and successive tortfeasors); Ky. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. § 411.182 (West 2008) (similar); Neb. Rev. Stat. § 25-\n\n21, 185.11 (similar).    We hold, therefore, that the proportionate\n\nshare rule delineated in Szendrey applies in this case.\n\n                           C.   The Remedy.\n\n          The appellees attempt to avert a remand by suggesting\n\nthat even if the Hotel arguably may have been entitled to a\n\nproportionate setoff, it waived that entitlement by not objecting\n\nto bifurcation and not requesting a special verdict apportioning\n\ndamages as among the defendants.    The Hotel responds that the law\n\nof the case doctrine provides it shelter because, unless and until\n\noverruled on appeal, \"a legal decision made at one stage of a\n\ncriminal or civil case constitutes the law of the case throughout\n\nthe pendency of the litigation.\"        Flibotte v. Pa. Truck Lines,\n\nInc., 131 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f               The Hotel has the better of this argument.       The Hospital\n\nwas not represented at the first-phase trial and the district court\n\nexplicitly ruled that the Hotel would be entitled to pursue its\n\ncross-claim after the conclusion of the first-phase trial.3               The\n\nbifurcation order was well within the encincture of the district\n\ncourt's discretion.       See, e.g., Lisa v. Fournier Marine Corp., 866\n\nF.2d 530, 531 (1st Cir. 1989); Gonzalez-Marin v. Equitable Life\n\nAssur. Soc., 845 F.2d 1140, 1145 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Charles\n\nAlan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 2388, at 113-\n\n19 (3d ed. 2008).           Accordingly,     the Hotel had no basis for\n\nobjecting to the bifurcation order — let alone an obligation to\n\nobject to it.\n\n               Given the circumstances that obtained, the Hotel was\n\nentitled to rely on the district court's stated intention to try\n\nthe issues of relative fault among the defendants in a second-phase\n\ntrial.        That obviated any need either to object to the jury\n\ninstructions or to lobby for a special verdict.              Cf. Williams v.\n\nRunyon, 130 F.3d 568, 573 (3d Cir. 1997) (finding reversible error\n\nwhen       court   at   start   of   trial    ruled   that   exhaustion   of\n\nadministrative remedies was not at issue and in reliance on that\n\nruling plaintiff presented no evidence concerning that issue, only\n\nfor court to reverse its original ruling post-trial and hold that\n\nexhaustion was essential).\n\n\n       3\n           Indeed, the court told the jury as much.\n\n                                     -20-\n\f          The appellees have a fallback position: they ruminate,\n\nwith little elaboration, that remand would be improper because\n\nSzendrey bars separate contribution suits. This musing elevates\n\nhope over reason.\n\n          The    Szendrey   court   made   no   sweeping   prohibition   of\n\ncontribution actions but, rather, restricted its holding to a\n\nspecific procedural situation. See Szendrey, 158 D.P.R. at 658-59.\n\nAlthough the court did find a particular contribution suit barred,\n\nbifurcation was never at issue.        We decline to read Szendrey so\n\nexpansively as to prohibit a federal court from bifurcating a claim\n\nfor contribution and trying that claim separately.4          Accordingly,\n\nwe hold that the Hotel is entitled to a trial on its cross-claim\n\nagainst the Hospital.\n\n          A few observations about the trial on the cross-claim may\n\nprove helpful.    First, the parties have a right to trial by jury.5\n\nSee In re N-500L Cases, 691 F.2d 15, 21 (1st Cir. 1982).          Second,\n\n\n     4\n      In view of this conclusion, we have no need to decide whether\na prohibition against bifurcation would be preempted by a federal\ncourt's explicit authority to bifurcate trials. See Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 42(b); Hydrite Chem. Co. v. Calumet Lubrics. Co., 47 F.3d 887,\n890-91 (7th Cir. 1995); Moss v. Associated Transp., Inc., 344 F.2d\n25-27 (6th Cir. 1965) (holding that Rule 42(b) preempts Tennessee\nlaw guaranteeing right to try all facts at the same time before one\njury); see generally Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 463-74 (1965)\n(establishing test to determine whether a given Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure preempts state law).\n     5\n      Questions as to the plaintiff's responsibility under the\nterms of the Release to defend and hold the Hospital harmless, see\nsupra note 1, are beyond the scope of this opinion. Consequently,\nwe take no view as to any such matter.\n\n                                    -21-\n\fin mandating a trial to fix the proportionate shares of the Hotel\n\nand the Hospital, respectively, we do not eliminate the possibility\n\nthat the Hotel may prove to be entitled to something approaching a\n\ndollar-for-dollar setoff.    That depends on the jury's subsequent\n\nverdict.   Third, should the Hotel's proportionate share of damages\n\nbe determined to be less than $444,000 (the difference between the\n\njury's award in the first-phase trial and the amount of the\n\nsettlement negotiated by the Hospital), the Hotel would have a\n\nright to pay that lesser amount in full satisfaction of its\n\nproportionate share.\n\n           We need go no further.   Although the Hotel has appealed\n\nfrom the denial of its motion for new trial, it has offered no\n\ndeveloped argumentation in support of that appeal and, thus, the\n\njury verdict must stand.     The district court's other post-trial\n\nrulings, however, were premised on a fundamental misconception of\n\nthe effect of that verdict.     To correct the ensuing errors, we\n\nreverse the dismissal of the Hotel's cross-claim and vacate the\n\ndenial of its Rule 59(e) motion.       On remand, we suggest that the\n\ndistrict court hold the latter motion (which, at bottom, requests\n\na setoff) in abeyance pending resolution of the cross-claim.\n\n\n\nAffirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.\n\nCosts shall be taxed in favor of the appellants as against the\n\ncross-defendant, appellee.\n\n\n                                -22-\n\f",

The   district    court\n\nbifurcated an action but, after the first-phase trial had been\n\ncompleted, misinterpreted the effect of the jury's verdict.                  That\n\nerror prompted a series of rulings which, among other things,\n\nforeclosed a second-phase trial.                  Because these rulings were\n\nerroneous and prejudiced substantial rights, we reverse one order,\n\nvacate another, and remand for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion and with Puerto Rico law governing the allocation of\n\ndamages between settling and non-settling successive tortfeasors.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            Edward and Myrella Fiorentino sojourned from Arizona to\n\nPuerto Rico to stay at the Westin Río Mar Beach Hotel.                 On December\n\n7, 2000, while swimming in the ocean, Edward was struck by a wave\n\nwhich   rendered       him    unconscious.          Following   his    shore-side\n\nresuscitation     by    a    group   of    vacationing    doctors,     lifeguards\n\nrealized that they lacked proper equipment for stabilization. When\n\nemergency    medical        personnel     finally    arrived,   they    placed   a\n\nsupportive collar around Edward's neck and transported him to the\n\nHospital San Pablo del Este (the Hospital).\n\n            Although a scan taken that same day indicated that a\n\ncervical vertebra had been broken, the medical staff failed to\n\ntreat the fracture. In the meantime, fragments pressed on Edward's\n\nspinal cord, causing swelling and nerve damage.                 Myrella had him\n\ntransferred to a hospital in Miami but, despite prompt surgical\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fintervention      there,        Edward    emerged     from     his    ordeal    as    a\n\nquadriplegic.\n\n            Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1),\n\nthe Fiorentinos filed suit in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico against the hotel and the entity that\n\nowned it (collectively, the Hotel) and against the Hospital.                        With\n\nrespect to the Hotel, the amended complaint alleged negligent\n\nfailure   to     warn   of    hazardous     beach    conditions       and    negligent\n\nentrustment      of     beach    safety    to     untrained     and    ill-equipped\n\nlifeguards.      With respect to the Hospital, the amended complaint\n\nalleged, among other things, medical malpractice.\n\n            Edward died before trial for reasons unconnected with the\n\naccident.      His wife, as personal representative of his estate and\n\nin her own behalf, pressed forward with the suit (accordingly, we\n\nhenceforth refer to her singularly as the plaintiff).                       Meanwhile,\n\nthe Hotel and the Hospital filed cross-claims against each other.\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(g).\n\n            As    trial      approached,    the     Hospital    settled      with    the\n\nplaintiff for $1,400,000, and the district court granted a motion\n\nto dismiss the amended complaint as to that defendant. The Hotel's\n\ncross-claim remained pending.             The court proceeded effectively to\n\nbifurcate what remained of the action, reserving the cross-claim\n\nfor a separate trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f           Before the first-phase trial commenced, the Hotel moved\n\nto compel disclosure of the release, settlement agreement, and\n\nrelated documents (collectively, the Release) memorializing the\n\nsettlement between the plaintiff and the Hospital.         The plaintiff\n\nopposed   the   motion.   The   court   did   not   act   on   the   matter\n\nimmediately, and the first-phase trial got underway.\n\n           The trial itself showcased the plaintiff's claims against\n\nthe Hotel (the Hospital did not participate).             At the charge\n\nconference, the judge reiterated how he had decided to structure\n\nthe proceedings, advising the Hotel that it could \"repeat against\n\nthe hospital\" in the second-phase trial all claims \"for any damages\n\nthat the hospital may have caused.\"      The judge then stated:\n\n           Basically, what I have done in this case is .\n           . . a bifurcation. I have tried plaintiffs'\n           causes of action against the hotel first.\n           Once that is over, if there is any reason to\n           go forward with [the] cross claim against the\n           hospital, then we'll have another jury trial,\n           and we'll go [forward with the] cross claim\n           against the hospital.\n\nLater that day, the court charged the jury. Pertinently, the court\n\ninstructed:\n\n                A person who by his negligence causes\n           physical   injuries    to   another  is   also\n           responsible   for   any   additional  injuries\n           suffered by that person as a result of the\n           medical services provided to treat the\n           original injuries.      Nothing precludes the\n           person who caused the original injuries to\n           recover from the hospital who provided the\n           medical services those additional injuries\n           caused by their insufficient care.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f                 If you find that the [Hotel] defendants .\n            . . are responsible for Mr. Fiorentino's\n            accident on December 7, 2000, you must also\n            determine that they are liable for all damages\n            sustained by him as a consequence of the\n            medical services provided to him to treat the\n            physical injuries suffered at the beach of the\n            Westin Río Mar Beach Hotel . . . .\n\nAfter deliberations, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the\n\nplaintiff in the amount of $1,844,000.\n\n            The    district    court   subsequently          granted     the   Hotel's\n\npending motion for disclosure of the Release.                   When produced, the\n\nsettlement accord proved to be fashioned along the lines of a\n\nPierringer release.      See Pierringer v.

R. Civ.\n\nP. 59(a), and a motion to alter or amend the verdict by, say, a\n\ndollar-for-dollar setoff of the settlement amount, see Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 59(e).     The district court denied both motions.     The court's\n\nrejection of the new trial motion is not seriously disputed on\n\nappeal. With respect to the Rule 59(e) motion, the court expressed\n\na belief that the Hotel, in filing it, had misconstrued the import\n\nof the jury's verdict.     The court wrote:\n\n                  During the trial, the jury was only\n             considering [the Hotel's] participation in the\n             event that caused plaintiff's damages.     The\n             only defendant at trial was [the Hotel]. The\n             evidence that was presented pertained to [the\n             Hotel's] negligence and involvement in the\n             events leading to plaintiff's injury.      The\n             jury was instructed to consider the damages\n             only as to [the Hotel] . . . .      Therefore,\n             this is not a situation of double recovery\n             because the jury was only considering the\n             damages as to [the Hotel].\n\n\n\n\n     2\n         Specifically the Release stated:\n\n          Plaintiffs shall indemnify and hold harmless the\n     settling Defendants . . . from and against all claims,\n     damages, and losses arising out of any claim made by an\n     entity to recover any amounts from the settling\n     Defendants which arise out of the incident alleged in the\n     Complaint, including any claims for medical expenses and\n     any and all claims for subrogation.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fIn line with this understanding, the court entered judgment against\n\nthe Hotel for the total amount of the verdict, denied its motion\n\nfor a setoff, and dismissed its cross-claim.   These timely appeals\n\nensued.\n\n II.   ANALYSIS\n\n           Our analysis is divided into three parts.    We begin by\n\naddressing the district court's rulings during the proceedings that\n\nfollowed the first-phase trial.    We then canvass the case law to\n\ndetermine the proper allocation of damages between settling and\n\nnon-settling tortfeasors in a successive tortfeasor case governed\n\nby Puerto Rico law.      Lastly, we turn to the remedy for the\n\ndiscerned error and furnish a roadmap for further proceedings.\n\n                    A.   The Post-Trial Rulings.\n\n           In the final analysis, the Hotel's assignments of error\n\nhinge upon the contention that the district court misconstrued the\n\nlegal import of the first-phase verdict — a misconception that it\n\nsays tainted the post-trial rulings.    The most critical of those\n\nrulings was made in connection with the Rule 59(e) motion.\n\n           Ordinarily, we review a district court's disposition of\n\na Rule 59(e) motion for abuse of discretion.       See Vasapolli v.\n\nRostoff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195712\"><a href=\"/opinion/195712/vasapolli-v-rostoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 36 (1st Cir. 1994).       But this is not the\n\nordinary circumstance.   Where, as here, the disposition of a Rule\n\n59(e) motion depends entirely on a question of law, our review is\n\nplenary.   See Pérez v. Volvo Car Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199393\"><a href=\"/opinion/199393/perez-de-munoz-v-volvo-car-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f2001); see also Charlesbank Equity Fund II v.

Since the cross-claim is at\n\nbottom a legal claim like any other, its dismissal is examined\n\nunder the de novo standard of review.        See Ruiz v. Bally Total\n\nFitness Holding Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202864\"><a href=\"/opinion/202864/ruiz-v-bally-total-fitness-holding-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5 (1st Cir. 2007); see also\n\nUnited States v.

We\n\nhave the luxury of time and, after careful consideration of the\n\nrecord, we conclude that both the district court's disposition of\n\nthe Rule 59(e) motion and its concomitant dismissal of the cross-\n\nclaim rest upon an incorrect interpretation of the effect of the\n\nfirst-phase verdict.   We elaborate below.\n\n          The jury instruction, quoted above, scarcely could have\n\nbeen more lucid in its exposition of an uncontroversial rule of\n\nPuerto Rico tort law: that tortfeasors must answer not only for the\n\ndamages immediately caused by their own negligence but also for any\n\nforeseeable aggravation thereof caused by the subsequent negligence\n\nof others. See Corey Lanuza v. Medic Emerg. Specialties, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2396768\"><a href=\"/opinion/2396768/corey-lanuza-v-medic-emergency-specialties-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

Gobierno de la Capital, 85 D.P.R. 552, 556-\n\n57 (P.R. 1962) (same).      No one claims that this instruction is an\n\nincorrect statement of law, nor is there the slightest reason to\n\nbelieve that the jury did not scrupulously adhere to it.            In any\n\nevent,     jurors    are   presumed    to    follow   the   trial   court's\n\ninstructions.       See Richardson v.

The court, however,\n\nappears to have misconceived the import of the ensuing verdict.\n\nApplying the instruction to the facts of this case, the verdict\n\nmust be presumed to have encompassed all the damages caused by both\n\nthe Hotel and the Hospital.      But the district court seems to have\n\nconstrued this fact as equivalent to a finding that the Hospital\n\nbore no responsibility for any part of those damages.          That is not\n\ncorrect.\n\n            Seeking to avoid the inevitable result of this reasoning,\n\nthe appellees asseverate that the Hotel failed to interpose a\n\ntimely objection to the instruction, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(d)(2),\n\nand that, therefore, the claim of error is forfeit. The appellees'\n\npremise is sound — no such contemporaneous objection was lodged —\n\nbut the conclusion that the appellees draw is insupportable.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f          The Hotel has not challenged the instruction itself\n\n(indeed, as we have said, no party has identified any flaw in the\n\ninstruction).     The challenge here concerns the district court's\n\ninterpretation of the effect of that instruction — no more and no\n\nless.   That interpretation did not emerge until after the first-\n\nphase verdict had been returned.\n\n          In such a situation, demanding that a party object at the\n\nconclusion of the charge in order to preserve its rights would be\n\ntantamount   to   demanding   that   a   party   anticipate   a   future\n\nhermeneutic misstep on the part of the trial court.       The law does\n\nnot require parties to possess that degree of clairvoyance.         Cf.\n\nUnited States v.

Taken to its logical\n\nconclusion, this argument suggests that the jury might have awarded\n\n$1,844,000 even while excluding from the amount awarded any damages\n\nflowing from shortcomings in Edward's care at the Hospital.\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f           That is not enough to render the court's error harmless.\n\nThe possibility that the jury could have followed such a path, as\n\nopposed to persuasive evidence that the jury actually did so, is\n\ninsufficient to overcome the Hotel's presumptive right to pursue\n\nits cross-claim and motion for setoff.

We\n\nconclude that the district court erred as a matter of law in its\n\nassessment of the effect of its own instruction and, thus, erred in\n\nits interpretation of what the first-phase verdict signified.\n\nUnder the instruction as given, the award encompassed both the\n\ndamages attributable to the Hotel's beachfront negligence and the\n\naggravating     damages   attributable     to     the   Hospital's   alleged\n\nmalpractice. Consequently, the district court erred in foreclosing\n\nfurther litigation; the Hotel was entitled to some process by which\n\nit could test how the plaintiff's total damages — $1,844,000 —\n\nshould be allocated as between it and the Hospital.            The district\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fcourt should not have denied the Rule 59(e) motion or dismissed the\n\ncross-claim without pursuing that inquiry.\n\n                      B.    Allocation of Damages.\n\n           The Release, by its terms, purports to free the Hospital\n\nfrom any further obligations arising out of Edward's injuries.                   A\n\nquestion   nonetheless     remains   as     to    its   overall     effect.    The\n\nplaintiff and the Hospital cannot by contracting between themselves\n\ndeny a third party rights that the third party (here, the Hotel)\n\nenjoys under the law.        We must, therefore, go beyond the four\n\ncorners of the Release in order to determine the rights of the\n\nparties inter sese.\n\n           Simply   put,    the   pivotal        question    here   concerns   the\n\nallocation   of   damages    as   between         settling    and    non-settling\n\ntortfeasors in a successive tortfeasor case.                 Because this is an\n\naction brought under diversity jurisdiction, the appropriate rule\n\nmust be gleaned from Puerto Rico law, not federal law.                         See\n\nVillarini-García v. Hosp. del Maestro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197320\"><a href=\"/opinion/197320/villarini-garcia-v-tomasini/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n           The protagonists recommend different models for the rule\n\nof decision.      The appellees contend that the Hotel's right of\n\ncontribution is limited to that proportion of the award (if any)\n\nthat can be attributed to the Hospital's negligence.                  See Austin,\n\n841 F.2d at 1190 (collecting cases adhering to this \"proportionate\n\nshare\" view).     The Hotel argues instead that there should be a\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fdollar-for-dollar setoff of the settlement amount ($1,400,000)\n\nagainst   the    verdict   amount   ($1,844,000),     thus    limiting   its\n\nresponsibility to the balance ($444,000).

Puerto Rico has not enacted such a statute, so our task\n\nis to make an informed prophecy as to which of these rules the\n\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court would probably choose in a successive\n\ntortfeasor situation.       See Blinzler v.

One\n\npotentially useful precedent, much touted by the Hotel, is our\n\ndecision in Villarini-García.          There, we interpreted Puerto Rico\n\nlaw as favoring a dollar-for-dollar setoff in a case concerning\n\nvicarious liability. See Villarini-García, 112 F.3d at 8. In that\n\ncontext, a dollar-for-dollar setoff rule makes perfect sense; after\n\nall, when one tortfeasor is vicariously liable for the actions of\n\nanother, the same damages are by definition attributed to each of\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fthe two tortfeasors and the prevention of a double recovery is a\n\nparamount concern.   See id.\n\n           Another potentially useful precedent, much touted by the\n\nappellees, is the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision in Szendrey\n\nv. Hospicare, 158 D.P.R. 648 (P.R. 2003).        There, the court\n\nendorsed the concept of proportionate share setoffs in a case\n\ninvolving joint tortfeasors, one of whom had obtained a Pierringer\n\nrelease prior to trial.   See id. at 657; see also Toledo v. Hosp.\n\nNuestra Señora de la Guadalupe, 167 D.P.R. ___, ___, 2006 TSPR 47,\n\n2006 JTS 56 at 1115-17 (P.R. 2006) (reaffirming the Szendrey\n\napproach).\n\n           None of these cases directly controls the situation at\n\nhand.   Here, we are confronted with a multiple tortfeasor scenario\n\nthat does not fall precisely under either the rubric of vicarious\n\nliability or that of joint tortfeasor liability. Unlike Villarini-\n\nGarcía, in which the defendants' liability arose from the same\n\nconduct (one was vicariously liable for the other's acts and\n\nomissions through a master-servant relationship), the Hotel and the\n\nHospital are each alleged to have been guilty of independently\n\ntortious conduct.    And unlike Szendrey, in which each of the two\n\njoint tortfeasors directly contributed to the same harm, the harms\n\nfor which the Hotel and the Hospital are allegedly responsible\n\noverlap, but they are not congruent; while the Hotel became liable\n\nfor the entire bundle of harms (that is, its negligence made it\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fliable not only for the damages flowing immediately therefrom but\n\nalso    for    whatever     damages      were    caused   by    the   Hospital's\n\nindependently tortious conduct), the Hospital never became liable\n\nunder any theory for the entire bundle of harms (that is, it never\n\nbecame liable for the pre-hospitalization damages attributable\n\nexclusively to the Hotel's antecedent negligence).\n\n              This imbalance, which results from the operation of a\n\nspecial tort rule dealing with the aggravation of injuries, is\n\nimportant.         Both commentators and judges have recognized the\n\ndistinctive nature of this type of situation and have labeled\n\nparties     like    the    Hotel   and    the    Hospital      \"independent\"   or\n\n\"successive\" tortfeasors, thus distinguishing them from garden-\n\nvariety joint tortfeasors.         See, e.g., 6 Jerome H. Nates et al.,\n\nDamages in Tort Actions § 51.03[1][d] (2007); see also McInnis v.\n\nA.M.F., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454262\"><a href=\"/opinion/454262/patricia-j-mcinnis-v-amf-inc-patricia-j-mcinnis-v-amf-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 250 n.10 (1st Cir. 1985).                    It is,\n\ntherefore,      apparent    that   successive      tortfeasor      liability   is\n\ndoctrinally distinct from joint tortfeasor liability.\n\n              We have considered these differences and have studied the\n\ntwo alternative approaches to possible setoffs.                 We believe that\n\nthe Puerto Rico Supreme Court would be more likely to employ\n\nSzendrey's proportionate share rule in a successive tortfeasor\n\ncase.   Our reasons are threefold.\n\n              In the first place, the analogue to a joint tortfeasor\n\nsituation      is    a    persuasive      one.       Easily      separable     and\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fdistinguishable tortious acts may be attributed to each tortfeasor.\n\nSee generally W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts §\n\n52, at 352 (5th ed. 1984).                Where successive tortfeasors are\n\nconcerned,   however,    the    initial      tortfeasor     is,    under   certain\n\ncircumstances,   accountable        for    tortious    conduct     of   the   later\n\ntortfeasor in order \"to ensure that a victim of negligence is not\n\nleft without recourse due to the inability to set apart the origin\n\nof the damages or to prove medical malpractice.\" Corey Lanuza, 229\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 101 (citing Merced, 85 D.P.R. at 557-58).                           A\n\nPierringer release executed with the second tortfeasor dissolves\n\nthis concern and molds the successive tortfeasor situation into one\n\nstrongly   resembling    a   joint    tortfeasor       situation     in    which   a\n\nPierringer   release    is     in   play    (that     is,   each   defendant       is\n\nultimately responsible only for its proportionate share of the\n\noverall damages).       See Austin, 841 F.2d at 1191; Szendrey, 158\n\nD.P.R. at 658-59.      The distinctions that exist between successive\n\ntortfeasors and tortfeasors who are linked only by principles of\n\nvicarious liability are, at one and the same time, much more stark\n\nand much less easily resolved.\n\n           Our two remaining reasons can be succinctly stated.\n\nFairly read, Szendrey seems to us to represent the default rule\n\nunder Puerto Rico law, which recognizes the settling parties'\n\nintent as controlling.       See Szendrey, 158 D.P.R. at 657-58 (\"This\n\nintention [to release the settling defendant from all liability] .\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f. . does not affect the cause of action asserted against the other\n\ncodefendants . . . insofar as it was so expressly agreed.\")\n\n(official translation, slip op. at 6).\n\n           Finally, Villarini-García was decided in 1997.            In our\n\nview, its reasoning has been colored, informed, and to some extent\n\nlimited by the later decision in Szendrey.          In this regard, it is\n\nespecially noteworthy that the Villarini-García court's focus on\n\nthe Puerto Rico courts' \"general hostility to double recovery,\"\n\n112 F.3d at 8, has been blurred by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's\n\nsubsequent selection of a proportionate setoff rule for joint\n\ntortfeasor cases despite the fact that, under this rule, plaintiffs\n\nmight   sometimes   receive   more    (or   less)   than   full    and    fair\n\ncompensation for their injuries.      See Szendrey, 158 D.P.R. at 658-\n\n59; see also Toledo, 167 D.P.R. at ___, 2006 TSPR 47, 2006 JTS 56\n\nat 1115-17 (affirming Szendrey).\n\n           These reasons lead us to conclude that in all likelihood\n\nthe Puerto Rico Supreme Court would find no meaningful difference\n\nbetween   successive   tortfeasors    and   joint   tortfeasors     for   the\n\npurpose of determining setoffs. Confirmation of this intuition can\n\nbe found in the fact that courts elsewhere tend to treat Pierringer\n\nreleases the same, whether the tortfeasors in question are joint or\n\nsuccessive.   Compare, e.g., Stueve v. Am. Honda Motors Co., 457 F.\n\nSupp. 740, 748-49 (D. Kan. 1978) (applying proportionate setoff in\n\nsuccessive    tortfeasor   context,   after   execution    of     Pierringer\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\frelease), and Hansen v.

Legislatures have\n\ntended to do the same.

We hold, therefore, that the proportionate\n\nshare rule delineated in Szendrey applies in this case.\n\n                           C.   The Remedy.\n\n          The appellees attempt to avert a remand by suggesting\n\nthat even if the Hotel arguably may have been entitled to a\n\nproportionate setoff, it waived that entitlement by not objecting\n\nto bifurcation and not requesting a special verdict apportioning\n\ndamages as among the defendants.    The Hotel responds that the law\n\nof the case doctrine provides it shelter because, unless and until\n\noverruled on appeal, \"a legal decision made at one stage of a\n\ncriminal or civil case constitutes the law of the case throughout\n\nthe pendency of the litigation.\"        Flibotte v.

The Hospital\n\nwas not represented at the first-phase trial and the district court\n\nexplicitly ruled that the Hotel would be entitled to pursue its\n\ncross-claim after the conclusion of the first-phase trial.3               The\n\nbifurcation order was well within the encincture of the district\n\ncourt's discretion.

Accordingly,     the Hotel had no basis for\n\nobjecting to the bifurcation order — let alone an obligation to\n\nobject to it.\n\n               Given the circumstances that obtained, the Hotel was\n\nentitled to rely on the district court's stated intention to try\n\nthe issues of relative fault among the defendants in a second-phase\n\ntrial.        That obviated any need either to object to the jury\n\ninstructions or to lobby for a special verdict.              Cf. Williams v.\n\nRunyon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"748764\"><a href=\"/opinion/748764/davon-williams-v-marvin-t-runyon-postmaster-general-united-states-postal/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 573 (3d Cir. 1997) (finding reversible error\n\nwhen       court   at   start   of   trial    ruled   that   exhaustion   of\n\nadministrative remedies was not at issue and in reliance on that\n\nruling plaintiff presented no evidence concerning that issue, only\n\nfor court to reverse its original ruling post-trial and hold that\n\nexhaustion was essential).\n\n\n       3\n           Indeed, the court told the jury as much.\n\n                                     -20-\n\f          The appellees have a fallback position: they ruminate,\n\nwith little elaboration, that remand would be improper because\n\nSzendrey bars separate contribution suits. This musing elevates\n\nhope over reason.\n\n          The    Szendrey   court   made   no   sweeping   prohibition   of\n\ncontribution actions but, rather, restricted its holding to a\n\nspecific procedural situation. See Szendrey, 158 D.P.R. at 658-59.\n\nAlthough the court did find a particular contribution suit barred,\n\nbifurcation was never at issue.        We decline to read Szendrey so\n\nexpansively as to prohibit a federal court from bifurcating a claim\n\nfor contribution and trying that claim separately.4          Accordingly,\n\nwe hold that the Hotel is entitled to a trial on its cross-claim\n\nagainst the Hospital.\n\n          A few observations about the trial on the cross-claim may\n\nprove helpful.    First, the parties have a right to trial by jury.5\n\nSee In re N-500L Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409634\"><a href=\"/opinion/409634/in-re-n-500l-cases-cornhill-insurance-company-ltd-and-corporacion/\"><span class=\"volume\">691</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21 (1st Cir. 1982).          Second,\n\n\n     4\n      In view of this conclusion, we have no need to decide whether\na prohibition against bifurcation would be preempted by a federal\ncourt's explicit authority to bifurcate trials. See Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 42(b); Hydrite Chem. Co. v. Calumet Lubrics. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"689171\"><a href=\"/opinion/689171/hydrite-chemical-company-affiliated-chemical-group-and-national-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">887</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n890-91 (7th Cir. 1995); Moss v.

Consequently,\nwe take no view as to any such matter.\n\n                                    -21-\n\fin mandating a trial to fix the proportionate shares of the Hotel\n\nand the Hospital, respectively, we do not eliminate the possibility\n\nthat the Hotel may prove to be entitled to something approaching a\n\ndollar-for-dollar setoff.    That depends on the jury's subsequent\n\nverdict.   Third, should the Hotel's proportionate share of damages\n\nbe determined to be less than $444,000 (the difference between the\n\njury's award in the first-phase trial and the amount of the\n\nsettlement negotiated by the Hospital), the Hotel would have a\n\nright to pay that lesser amount in full satisfaction of its\n\nproportionate share.\n\n           We need go no further.   Although the Hotel has appealed\n\nfrom the denial of its motion for new trial, it has offered no\n\ndeveloped argumentation in support of that appeal and, thus, the\n\njury verdict must stand.     The district court's other post-trial\n\nrulings, however, were premised on a fundamental misconception of\n\nthe effect of that verdict.     To correct the ensuing errors, we\n\nreverse the dismissal of the Hotel's cross-claim and vacate the\n\ndenial of its Rule 59(e) motion.       On remand, we suggest that the\n\ndistrict court hold the latter motion (which, at bottom, requests\n\na setoff) in abeyance pending resolution of the cross-claim.\n\n\n\nAffirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.\n\nCosts shall be taxed in favor of the appellants as against the\n\ncross-defendant, appellee.\n\n\n                                -22-\n\f</pre>",
