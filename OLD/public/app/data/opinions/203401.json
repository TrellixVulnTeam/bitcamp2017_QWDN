Brock Hornby,    U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n               and Tashima,* Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Eric A. Vos, Assistant Federal Defender, with whom David\nBeneman, Federal Defender, was on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          July 18, 2008\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f                 TASHIMA, Senior Circuit Judge.         Defendant-Appellant Cori\n\nA. Godin challenges her conviction for aggravated identity theft\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1).            The statute adds a mandatory two-\n\nyear term of imprisonment to that otherwise provided for certain\n\nenumerated felonies if, “during and in relation to” the felony, the\n\nperpetrator        “knowingly    transfers,     possesses,      or   uses,   without\n\nlawful authority, a means of identification of another person.” 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1).           The question before this court is how far\n\nthe “knowingly” mens rea requirement extends.                  Must the defendant\n\nknow that the means of identification belongs to another person?\n\nWe conclude that the statute is ambiguous and that the legislative\n\nhistory does not clearly reveal congressional intent. Applying the\n\nrule of lenity, as we must, we hold that the “knowingly” mens rea\n\nrequirement extends to “of another person.”                    In other words, to\n\nobtain a conviction under § 1028A(a)(1), the government must prove\n\nthat       the    defendant   knew     that    the   means     of    identification\n\ntransferred,        possessed,    or   used    during    the    commission    of   an\n\nenumerated felony belonged to another person.                  The government did\n\nnot do so here.         Accordingly, we reverse Godin’s conviction.1\n\n                                  I.    Background\n\n                 In 2006, Godin defrauded eight banks and credit unions\n\n(collectively, the “banks”).            She opened accounts using fabricated\n\nsocial security numbers, closed some accounts, and then deposited\n\n\n       1\n                 We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fchecks drawn on the closed accounts into the still open accounts.\n\nGodin then withdrew funds from the falsely inflated accounts.        In\n\nthis manner, Godin defrauded the banks of approximately $40,000.\n\n           Godin fabricated seven different social security numbers\n\nby altering the fourth and fifth digits of her own social security\n\nnumber.    Godin’s social security number is 004-82-XXXX.2       Of the\n\nseven fabricated numbers, only one, number 004-44-XXXX, belonged to\n\nanother person.     Godin opened an account at Bank of America with\n\nthe fabricated 004-44-XXXX number but provided the bank with her\n\ncorrect name, address, date of birth, driver’s license number, and\n\ntelephone number.\n\n           The   government   charged   Godin   in   a   seventeen-count\n\nindictment: six counts of bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1344, ten counts of social security fraud in violation of 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 408(a)(7)(B), and one count of aggravated identity theft in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1).     In the aggravated identity\n\ntheft count, Godin was charged with knowingly using social security\n\nnumber 004-44-XXXX during and in relation to one of the bank fraud\n\ncounts (Count 4) and one of the social security fraud counts (Count\n\n15).\n\n           Godin moved to dismiss Count 17, the aggravated identity\n\ntheft count, arguing that the government had to prove that she knew\n\n\n\n       2\n          We redact the last four digits of each social security\nnumber for the sake of privacy.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fthat the 004-44-XXXX social security number belonged to another\n\nperson.         The District Court denied the motion to dismiss, but\n\ndeclined to reach the mens rea issue.               United States v. Godin\n\n(Godin I), 476 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D. Me. 2007).          Noting that what Godin\n\nknew about the number remained a question of fact,3 the District\n\nCourt “decline[d] to make an abstract decision on an issue that\n\nultimately may not reflect the actual facts.”            Id. at 3.\n\n                Thereafter, Godin pleaded guilty to the sixteen bank and\n\nsocial security fraud counts.             Godin proceeded to trial only on\n\nCount 17, the aggravated identity theft count.               At trial, Godin\n\nstipulated that she committed bank and social security fraud and\n\nthat she knew that the social security numbers she used in relation\n\nto those felonies were not her own.\n\n                The government called two witnesses.          The first was\n\nemployed by Bank of America and testified that Godin used number\n\n004-44-XXXX to open an account but that she gave the bank her\n\ncorrect name, address, phone number, driver’s license number, and\n\ndate of birth.          The government then called a Special Agent for the\n\nSocial Security Administration (“Agent”). The Agent testified that\n\nby   searching      a    secure   and   password-protected   Social   Security\n\nAdministration database, he determined that social security number\n\n\n        3\n                In opposing the motion to dismiss, the government argued\n“that       it [was] simply incredible for the Defendant to claim that\nthere       was no way she could have known at least one of these numbers\n. . .       was assigned to another individual.” Godin I, 476 F. Supp.\n2d at       3.\n\n                                         -4-\n\f004-44-XXXX was assigned to a man who resided in Maine.4                 The Agent\n\nalso testified that he could not tell by looking at the number that\n\nit   belonged   to    another   person     because   there    are   millions   of\n\nunassigned numbers. Godin did not dispute any of this evidence but\n\nput her true social security number, 004-82-XXXX, into evidence.\n\n           After the government’s case in chief, Godin moved for a\n\njudgment   of   acquittal       pursuant    to    Federal    Rule   of   Criminal\n\nProcedure 29.        She argued that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsupport a verdict because the government presented no evidence to\n\nshow that she knew the false number belonged to someone else.                  The\n\nDistrict Court denied the motion.                The District Court gave two\n\nreasons for its decision.           First, the scienter issue remained\n\nunresolved.     Second, the District Court believed that the jury\n\ncould find that Godin knew the number belonged to someone else.\n\n           Both parties debated the scienter requirement at a jury\n\ncharge conference.        While acknowledging that it was “a close\n\nissue,” the District Court instructed the jury as follows:\n\n           To convict Cori Godin of this offense, the\n      government must prove each of the following elements\n      beyond a reasonable doubt:\n           First, Cori Godin committed bank fraud and / or\n      social security fraud felony violations.     The parties\n      stipulate that she did so.\n           Second, during and in relation to one or both of\n      those other felony violations, Cori Godin knowingly used\n      a means of identification without lawful authority.\n           Third, that means of identification belonged to\n      another person.\n\n\n      4\n           The record does not reveal the individual’s name.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f       . . .\n            “Knowingly” means that the act was done voluntarily\n       and intentionally and not because of mistake or accident.\n       The government must prove that Cori Godin knew that she\n       did not have lawful authority to use the means of\n       identification in question.      The government is not\n       required to prove that she knew the means of\n       identification actually belonged to another person.\n\nUnited States v. Godin (Godin II), 489 F. Supp. 2d 118, 119-20 (D.\n\nMe. 2007).\n\n               In explaining its decision, the District Court first\n\nnoted    that    the       language   of     §    1028A(a)(1)       was   “not   strongly\n\npersuasive in either direction,” but permitted the District Court’s\n\nreading.      Id. at 120.       Second, the weight of case law at that time\n\nfavored a narrow scienter requirement. Id. Third, “knowingly” had\n\nto extend to “means of identification” because the statute requires\n\nthat    the    defendant       know   that       the   means   of   identification    is\n\nfraudulent.          Id.     Finally, the purpose of the statue, punishing\n\n“identity theft,” supported stopping the scienter requirement at\n\n“means of identification” and not extending it to “of another\n\nperson” because the person whose number Godin used “was a victim of\n\nidentity theft, whether Godin knew that she was stealing his\n\nidentity or not.”            Id. at 121.\n\n               The    jury    returned     a     guilty   verdict.         Godin   timely\n\nappeals, contending that the court charged the jury in error and\n\nthat the evidence was insufficient to convict her of aggravated\n\nidentity theft under § 1028A(a)(1).\n\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\f                        II.   Scienter Requirement\n\n            The circuits are divided on the issue of whether the\n\n“knowingly” scienter requirement in § 1028A(a)(1) extends to “of\n\nanother person.”    The Fourth, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits have\n\nconcluded that it does not. United States v. Mendoza-Gonzalez, 520\n\nF.3d 912, 915 (8th Cir. 2008); United States v. Hurtado, 508 F.3d\n\n603, 607 (11th Cir. 2007) cert. denied, ___ S. Ct. ___, 2008 WL\n\n488011 (June 9, 2008); United States v. Montejo, 442 F.3d 213, 214\n\n(4th Cir.), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 366 (2006).            The D.C. Circuit\n\nrecently concluded, however, that it does.                 United States v.\n\nVillanueva-Sotelo, 515 F.3d 1234, 1236 (D.C. Cir. 2008). We review\n\nde   novo    “alleged     jury      instruction   errors     involving   the\n\ninterpretation of the elements of a statutory offense.”              United\n\nStates v. Soto-Beniquez, 356 F.3d 1, 44-45 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            Our interpretive task begins with the statute’s text.\n\nUnited States v. Jimenez, 507 F.3d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 2007).           We look\n\nto the plain meaning of the words in “‘the broader context of the\n\nstatute as a whole.’”      United States v. Roberson, 459 F.3d 39, 51\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Mullane v. Chambers, 333 F.3d 322, 330\n\n(1st Cir. 2003)).       If the meaning of the text is unambiguous our\n\ntask ends there as well.      Id.    If the statute is ambiguous, we look\n\nbeyond the text to the legislative history in order to determine\n\ncongressional intent. Gen. Motors Corp. v. Darling’s, 444 F.3d 98,\n\n108 (1st Cir. 2006) (internal citations omitted).             “A statute is\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fambiguous    only   if     it        admits    of   more     than    one    reasonable\n\ninterpretation.”    Id. (citing Thinking Machs. Corp. v. Mellon Fin.\n\nServs. Corp. #1 (In re Thinking Machs. Corp.), 67 F.3d 1021, 1025\n\n(1st Cir. 1995)).\n\n            Section 1028A(a)(1) provides, in relevant part,\n\n      Whoever, during and in relation to any felony violation\n      enumerated in subsection (c), knowingly transfers,\n      possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of\n      identification of another person shall, in addition to\n      the punishment provided for such felony, be sentenced to\n      a term of imprisonment of 2 years.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1).5            “Knowingly,” as an adverb, modifies the\n\nverbs “transfers, possesses, or uses.”                    The prepositional phrase\n\n“without lawful authority” is an adverb phrase that also modifies\n\nthe verbs.      “Means” is the direct object of the verbs, and the\n\nprepositional phrase “of identification” is an adjective phrase\n\nthat modifies the direct object. Finally, the prepositional phrase\n\n“of   another    person”        is     an     adjective     phrase   that    modifies\n\n“identification.”        Together, “knowingly transfers, possesses, or\n\nuses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of\n\nanother person” is a participial phrase describing the subject\n\n“whoever.”\n\n            The government argues that “knowingly,” because it is an\n\nadverb, modifies the verbs, and the Fourth, Eighth, and Eleventh\n\n\n      5\n          Among the felonies enumerated in § 1028A(c) are social\nsecurity fraud and bank fraud. 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(c)(4) & (5).\n     A social security number is a “means of identification.” Id.\n§ 1028(d)(7)(A).\n\n                                            -8-\n\fCircuits agree.      Mendoza-Gonzalez, 520 F.3d at 915; Hurtado, 508\n\nF.3d at 609; Montejo, 442 F.3d at 215.              In a purely grammatical\n\nsense,   “knowingly,”       as   an    adverb,    modifies     only     the   verbs\n\n“transfers, possesses, or uses.” In interpreting § 1028A, however,\n\nwe are not engaged in a purely grammatical exercise.                   In criminal\n\nstatutes, adverbs that are also mens rea requirements frequently\n\nextend to non-verbs.         See Villanueva-Sotelo, 515 F.3d at 1238\n\n(explaining   that    the    term     “modify,”    when     used   in    statutory\n\ninterpretation,      is   better      equated    with   the    terms     “‘apply,’\n\n‘extend,’ or ‘attach.’”).        Cases holding that “knowingly” extends\n\nto words and phrases other than verbs are legion.                       See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Edgerton, 510 F.3d 54, 57 (1st Cir. 2007) (holding\n\nthat a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(6) requires proof that\n\na defendant knowingly made a false statement when purchasing a\n\nfirearm); United States v. Leahy, 473 F.3d 401, 408 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(noting that 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), the felon-in-possession statute,\n\nrequires   knowing    possession       of   a   firearm);     United    States   v.\n\nGonsalves, 435 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir. 2006) (affirming that 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1001, making false statements to the government, requires\n\nthat a defendant knowingly make a false statement); United States\n\nv. Hussein, 351 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 2003) (noting that under 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1), the government must prove that the defendant\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fknowingly possessed a controlled substance).6 Because we interpret\n\na criminal statute and not an English textbook, we cannot say that\n\nthe best or even most likely reading of § 1028A(a)(1) is to limit\n\nthe adverb “knowingly” to the verbs it modifies.\n\n          The Fourth Circuit also argues that “knowingly” only\n\nmodifies the verbs “transfers, possesses, or uses” because, “good\n\nusage” requires that it be placed “as close as possible to the\n\nwords which it modifies.”    Montejo, 442 F.3d at 215 (internal\n\ncitation omitted).   Thus, the court concludes, “knowingly” cannot\n\nmodify the entire “lengthy” phrase.7   Id.   We are not persuaded by\n\n\n     6\n          In United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64\n(1994), on which both parties rely, the Supreme Court applied a\n“knowingly” scienter requirement to non-verbs in a child\npornography statute.    We find this case to be inapposite.     The\nstatute at issue provided punishment for, in relevant part, “‘[a]ny\nperson who [] knowingly transports or ships . . . any visual\ndepiction, if – [] the producing of such visual depiction involves\nthe use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.’” Id. at\n67-68 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 2252 (1988 ed. and Supp. V)). The Court\nextended “knowingly” beyond the verbs it directly modified to “the\nuse of a minor” because there is a “presumption in favor of a\nscienter requirement . . . [for] each of the statutory elements\nthat criminalize otherwise innocent conduct.” Id. at 72. Here,\n“of another person” is not an element that criminalizes otherwise\ninnocent conduct, so the presumption does not apply. X-Citement\nVideo, however, does not instruct us that we may only extend a\nscienter requirement to an element of a crime when there is such a\npresumption. Thus, it does not speak directly to our case.\n     7\n          The Fourth Circuit appears to have mistakenly referred to\nthe phrase in question as a predicate. See Montejo, 442 F.3d at\n215. The predicate in 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1), however, is “shall\n. . . be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years.” See The\nChicago Manual of Style 5.23 (15th ed. 2003) (defining predicate as\n“the part that contains a verb and makes an assertion about the\nsubject” and providing examples).     Our phrase is a participial\nphrase because it begins with a participle and modifies the subject\n\n                               -10-\n\fthe Fourth Circuit’s reasoning.                The phrase is not very long\n\n(fifteen words out of a forty-seven word sentence), and it is one\n\nphrase out of four within the same sentence.                      There are three\n\nadditional phrases in the same sentence to which “of another\n\nperson” does not belong.          It is as reasonable to read “knowingly”\n\nto extend to all of the words within the phrase it inhabits as it\n\nis to further divide the phrase and limit the reach of “knowingly”\n\nto just a portion of the phrase.          See X-Citement Video, 513 U.S. at\n\n79   (Stevens,     J.,     concurring)     (“In   my     opinion,     the   normal,\n\ncommonsense      reading     of   a    subsection      of   a    criminal   statute\n\nintroduced by the word ‘knowingly’ is to treat that adverb as\n\nmodifying each of the elements of the offense identified in the\n\nremainder of the subsection.”).\n\n           Thus, we easily reach the conclusion that knowingly can\n\nextend beyond the verbs it directly modifies.                   The question still\n\nremains,     however,      does   it    extend    to    “of     another     person”?\n\n           The District Court concluded that “knowingly” has to\n\nextend at least to “a means of identification.”                  Godin II, 489 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 120; Godin I, 476 F. Supp. 2d at 2.                           We agree.\n\nOtherwise, the statute would criminalize the transfer, possession,\n\nor use of anything that contained a means of identification, e.g.,\n\na package, even if the person charged did not know that the thing\n\nhe or she transferred, possessed, or used contained a means of\n\n\n“whoever.”    See Id. at 5.109.\n\n                                        -11-\n\fidentification.       As the District Court noted, such a result would\n\nbe absurd.\n\n     If during a bank conspiracy, I hand a defendant a sealed\n     envelope asking her to transfer it and its contents to\n     another and she knowingly does so, she has knowingly\n     transferred the envelope and its contents. But, if she\n     believes my statement that the envelope contains only a\n     birthday card when in fact it contains a forged social\n     security card, the government surely would not contend\n     that she should receive the enhanced penalty.\n\nId.; see also Villanueva-Sotelo, 515 F.3d at 1238 (reaching the\n\nsame conclusion) (citing Godin I, 476 F. Supp. 2d at 2).\n\n              We are convinced our interpretation is correct to this\n\npoint.    We are also convinced that whether “knowingly” extends\n\nbeyond “means of identification” to its modifier “of another\n\nperson” is ambiguous.           In coming to this conclusion we rely\n\nprimarily on Liparota v. United States, 471 U.S. 419 (1985), in\n\nwhich the Court concluded that the plain text of a similarly\n\nstructured statute was ambiguous.\n\n              The Court analyzed the reach of the scienter requirement\n\nin a food stamp statute that punished “‘[w]hoever knowingly uses,\n\ntransfers, acquires, alters, or possesses coupons or authorization\n\ncards    in    any   manner   not   authorized   by   this   chapter   or   the\n\nregulations issued pursuant to this chapter.’”               Id. at 420 n.1\n\n(quoting 7 U.S.C. § 2024(b)(1) (1982)). The government argued that\n\n“knowingly” did not extend to “in any manner not authorized by this\n\nchapter or the regulations issued pursuant to this chapter.”                Id.\n\nat 421.       The Court concluded that the text could not answer the\n\n                                      -12-\n\fquestion.   Either limiting knowingly to the verbs and their direct\n\nobjects or extending it throughout the entire phrase “would accord\n\nwith ordinary usage.”      Id. at 424.\n\n            The Court then went a step further and explained that\n\nstatutes constructed in this manner are generally ambiguous. As an\n\nexample, the Court noted that the mens rea requirement in a statute\n\npunishing someone who “knowingly sells a security without a permit”\n\ncannot be determined by the plain text.              Id. at 424-25 n.7\n\n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted).        “As a matter of\n\ngrammar the statute is ambiguous; it is not at all clear how far\n\ndown the sentence the word ‘knowingly’ is intended to travel.” Id.\n\n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted).        We join with the\n\nD.C. Circuit and conclude that the text of § 1028A(a)(1) is\n\nambiguous because the Court has determined that “text alone cannot\n\nresolve statutes structured this way.”       See Villanueva-Sotelo, 515\n\nF.3d at 1241.\n\n            Because the plain meaning of the text is not clear, “we\n\nconsider    surrounding    language   and   the   statute’s   structure.”\n\nJimenez, 507 F.3d at 19.      As we explained in Jimenez, § 1028A has\n\n“two variations.”    Id.    The jury convicted Godin under the first,\n\n§ 1028A(a)(1).      The second, § 1028A(a)(2), provides a harsher\n\npunishment for those who commit aggravated identity theft in\n\nrelation to a “terrorism offense.”\n\n     Whoever, during and in relation to any [terrorism\n     offense] knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without\n\n                                  -13-\n\f      lawful authority, a means of identification of another\n      person or a false identification document shall in\n      addition to the punishment provided for such felony, be\n      sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 years.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(2) (emphasis added).              If “knowingly” reaches\n\n“of another person” in § 1028A(a)(2), then it should also stretch\n\nto “of another person” in § 1028A(a)(1).\n\n             When arguing Villanueva-Sotelo, the government conceded\n\nthat the scienter requirement in § 1028A(a)(2) extended to “false\n\nidentification document.”            Villanueva-Sotelo, 515 F.3d at 1239.\n\nThus, in paragraph (2), “knowingly” can reasonably be read to\n\nextend to “of another person” because it reaches all the way to\n\n“false identification document.”             See id. at 1239-40.     We do not\n\nsee   that   as    the    only   plausible     reading,   however.    A   second\n\nreasonable interpretation is that “knowingly” only extends to the\n\ntwo   direct      objects    and    their    primary   modifiers:    “means   of\n\nidentification” and “false identification documents.”                Thus, the\n\nstatute’s structure does not resolve the ambiguity.\n\n             We may also look to the title of a statute to resolve\n\nambiguity in the text.             Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523\n\nU.S. 224, 234 (1998).              Section 1028A is entitled “Aggravated\n\nidentity theft.”         As the D.C. Circuit noted, an element of theft is\n\nthe intent to deprive another of property.             Villanueva-Sotelo, 515\n\nF.3d at 1243 (internal citations omitted).                Thus, employing the\n\nD.C. Circuit’s reasoning, “knowingly” must extend to “of another\n\nperson” because, to convict someone of theft, the government must\n\n                                        -14-\n\fprove that the defendant knew he or she was taking something from\n\nanother.\n\n           We do not agree that the title resolves the ambiguity in\n\nthe text. Congress’ use of the word “theft” certainly supports the\n\nconclusion that “knowingly” extends to “of another person” and\n\nmakes this interpretation eminently reasonable.            See United States\n\nv.   Jahagirdar,   466   F.3d   149,   153   (1st   Cir.   2006)   (“‘[W]here\n\nCongress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal\n\ntradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows\n\nand adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed\n\nword . . . .’”) (quoting Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246,\n\n263 (1952)).    We do not believe, however, that the use of the word\n\n“theft” compels a broad scienter requirement. It is also plausible\n\nthat Congress intended to define “identity theft” as using someone\n\nelse’s identity rather than taking someone else’s identity.            After\n\nall, the effect on a victim’s credit rating is the same whether\n\nsomeone (1) makes up a social security number, procures credit with\n\nthat number, and does not repay or (2) steals a social security\n\nnumber from a database, procures credit with that number, and does\n\nnot repay.     It is not clear that, by using the word “theft,”\n\nCongress intended to limit “identity theft” to the latter scenario.\n\n           Because the structure and title of the statute do not\n\nresolve the ambiguity in the text, we turn next to the legislative\n\nhistory.   See Darling’s, 444 F.3d at 108.          Congress added § 1028A\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fto the United States Code through the “Identity Theft Penalty\n\nEnhancement Act,” Pub. L. No. 108-275, 118 Stat. 831 (2004).              The\n\nHouse Report accompanying the Act is replete with the terms “theft”\n\nand “thieves.”     “[T]he ‘Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act[]’\n\naddresses the growing problem of identity theft.”             H.R. Rep. No.\n\n108-528, at 3, as reprinted in          2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. 779, 780.       One\n\nstated   purpose   of   the   statute    is   to   increase   sentences   for\n\n“identity thieves.”8       Id.    The report also gives examples of\n\nidentity   theft    that   fit   comfortably       within   the   traditional\n\ndefinition of theft: a health club employee took credit-card and\n\nsocial security numbers from health club members; an individual\n\n“stole” identities from multiple people and then used the false\n\nidentities to file false tax returns; a woman used a “stolen\n\nidentity” to apply for social security benefits.            Id. at 5-6, 2004\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 781-82.\n\n           From this emphasis on “theft,” the D.C. Circuit concluded\n\nthat Congress intended only to punish “thieves,” or those who\n\nknowingly use another’s identification.             Villanueva-Sotelo, 515\n\nF.3d at 1244-45.    We agree that this is a reasonable reading of the\n\n\n     8\n          In Jimenez, we noted that another purpose of the\naggravated identity theft statute is to deter the use of real\nidentifications during the commission of a crime because real\nidentifications provide better cover than false identifications.\nJimenez, 507 F.3d at 20. We do not question this explanation of\nthe purpose of the statute, but we do not find it relevant to the\ncurrent discussion.   Those who use real identification so that\ntheir crimes will be harder to detect generally know that the\nidentification belongs to another person.\n\n                                   -16-\n\flegislative history.       The problem is that one can also reasonably\n\nglean from the legislative history an intent to cover actions that\n\ndo not fit the traditional definition of theft.                The same House\n\nReport defines identity theft broadly: “The terms ‘identity theft’\n\nand ‘identity fraud’ refer to all types of crimes in which someone\n\nwrongfully obtains and uses another person’s personal data . . . .”\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 108-528, at 4, 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 780.                     “All\n\ncrimes”      could   conceivably    cover   crimes      that    fall    outside\n\ntraditional theft.       Indeed, several of the anecdotal examples of\n\nidentity theft describe crimes that did not involve stealing a\n\nmeans of identification from another.            In one case, a woman used\n\nher    husband’s     social   security   number    to   collect    disability\n\nbenefits, and, in a similar case, a man used his brother-in-law’s\n\nname   and    social   security    number   to    receive   social     security\n\nbenefits.     Id. at 6, 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 782.           Neither of these\n\ncases describes a crime in which the defendant stole a means of\n\nidentification from another; the only victim was the government.\n\nIn another example, one closer to Godin’s case, a woman received\n\nsocial security benefits using her social security number but used\n\nanother’s social security number to procure employment. Id. It is\n\nnot clear whether or not the woman knew that the false number\n\nbelonged to someone else.\n\n             Additionally, the definition of “identity theft” given in\n\nthe House Report encompasses the use of false identification to\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\freceive immigration benefits.       Id. at 4, 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 780.\n\nIf an undocumented immigrant purchases a social security number\n\nfrom a third party and uses that number to obtain employment, he or\n\nshe may not know that it is assigned to another person.             The third\n\nparty may know that the number is a valid number, assigned to a\n\nreal person, but the immigrant may not.                 Yet Congress arguably\n\nintended “aggravated identity theft” to cover both the crime\n\ncommitted by the third party and that committed by the undocumented\n\nimmigrant.\n\n           Congress’ use of the term “theft” and the accompanying\n\ndescriptive anecdotes in the legislative history do not clearly\n\nevince   congressional    intent.     We       remain    unsure   whether,    in\n\ncodifying § 1028A(a)(1), Congress intended to increase punishment\n\nfor crimes in which a person knowingly uses a false means of\n\nidentification without knowing that the identification belongs to\n\nanother.   Thus, we conclude that the legislative history does not\n\nresolve the statute’s ambiguity.\n\n           If   a   statute   contains     a   “grievous     ambiguity,”     the\n\nambiguity must be resolved in the defendant’s favor. United States\n\nv. Councilman, 418 F.3d 67, 83 (1st Cir. 2005) (en banc); see also\n\nUnited States v. Santos, 128 S. Ct. 2020, 2025 (2008) (plurality\n\nopinion) (“The rule of lenity requires ambiguous criminal laws to\n\nbe interpreted in favor of the defendants subjected to them.”).\n\nThe rule of lenity “‘applies only if, after seizing everything from\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fwhich aid can be derived, [a court] can make no more than a guess\n\nas   to   what   Congress    intended.’”        Councilman,    418    F.3d   at    83\n\n(alteration in original) (quoting Reno v. Koray, 515 U.S. 50, 65\n\n(1995)).\n\n            Using all methods of statutory construction available to\n\nus, we are unable to ascertain whether Congress intended the\n\n“knowingly” mens rea requirement to extend to “of another person.”\n\nThe language of § 1028A is ambiguous.                The ambiguity cannot be\n\nresolved by the statutory structure, the title, or the legislative\n\nhistory.    We hold that the rule of lenity applies, and the scienter\n\nrequirement      must   stretch    to    “of    another    person.”    Thus,      the\n\nDistrict Court instructed the jury in error.\n\n                    III.    Sufficiency of the evidence\n\n            Generally,      if    an    erroneous   jury    instruction      is   not\n\nharmless error, we vacate the conviction and remand for a new\n\ntrial.     In the present case, however, Godin also argues that the\n\ngovernment presented insufficient evidence to support a conviction\n\nunder § 1028A(a)(1).        The two analyses differ as do the necessary\n\noutcomes.     United States v. Baldyga, 233 F.3d 674, 679 n.3 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n            When examining whether the omission of an element in a\n\njury instruction is harmless error, we ask “‘whether the record\n\ncontains evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding\n\nwith respect to the omitted element.’” Id. at 682 (quoting Neder v.\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fUnited States, 527 U.S. 1, 19 (1999)).                   If the error is not\n\nharmless, we vacate the conviction and remand for a new trial.                 Id.\n\nat 679 n.3.    When examining the sufficiency of the evidence, we ask\n\nwhether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\njury’s   verdict,      “a    rational    factfinder     could   find   that    the\n\ngovernment proved the essential elements of its case beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.”          United States v. Marin, 523 F.3d 24, 27 (1st\n\nCir. 2008) (citing United States v. Stark, 499 F.3d 72, 79 (1st\n\nCir. 2007)).         If we conclude the evidence is not sufficient to\n\nsupport a charge, we reverse the conviction and dismiss the charge.\n\nBaldyga, 233 F.3d at 679 n.3.                  When a defendant raises both\n\narguments, we address the sufficiency of the evidence first. If we\n\nconclude the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction, we\n\nthen ask whether the jury instruction error was harmless.                    If we\n\nconclude    that     the    evidence    is   not   sufficient   to   support   the\n\nconviction and that a motion to acquit should have been granted,\n\nthat conclusion is dispositive and we need go no further.                See id.\n\nat 682 n.8 (explaining that a court may still find that an\n\nerroneous     jury    instruction      constitutes    reversible     error   after\n\nfinding that evidence was sufficient to support the verdict);\n\nUnited States v. St. Michael’s Credit Union, 880 F.2d 579, 588-89\n\n(1st Cir. 1989) (holding that evidence was sufficient to support\n\nthe verdict but vacating conviction and remanding for jury trial\n\nbecause error in jury instruction was not harmless); United States\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\fv.

Villafane-Jimenez, 410 F.3d\n\n74, 80 n.6 (1st Cir. 2005).       In our review of the evidence\n\npresented at trial, we find nothing to support a finding that Godin\n\nknew that social security number 004-44-XXXX belonged to another\n\nperson.   The false number was identical to her own except for the\n\nfourth and fifth digits.   The only inference a rational jury could\n\nmake from this evidence is that Godin randomly selected the two\n\nfabricated numbers.   The Agent testified that one cannot know just\n\nby looking at a number whether it is assigned to another person\n\nbecause there are millions of unassigned numbers.    The Agent did\n\nnot know that the number was assigned to another until he ran a\n\nsearch in a secure, password-protected database.    The government\n\n\n     9\n          In Gens, the defendants were charged with eight counts of\nwillfully misapplying funds from a federally-insured bank. Gens,\n493 F.3d at 217. The defendants executed a scheme in which the two\ndefendants who controlled the bank loaned money to debtors who then\ngave the funds to a third defendant. Id. at 218-19. The district\ncourt instructed the jury that, to reach a guilty verdict, they\nneeded only to find that the defendants knew that loan proceeds\nwere going to a person other than the debtors. Id. at 221. We\nheld that this was error because the government also had to show\nthat the defendants knew that the debtors would not repay. Id. at\n222. We reversed the defendants’ convictions on seven of the eight\ncounts because substantial evidence did not support a finding of\nwillful misapplication.    Id. at 223.    On the eighth count, we\nvacated the conviction and remanded for a new trial because the\ngovernment had presented sufficient evidence for a jury to find\nthat the defendants knew that the debtor on one of the loans would\nnot repay. Id. at 223-24.\n\n                                -21-\n\fpresented no evidence showing that Godin had access to a similar\n\ndatabase, knew the individual to whom the social security number\n\nbelonged, or somehow accessed that person’s information.        The\n\ngovernment concedes as much on appeal, arguing only that the\n\nevidence was sufficient for a jury to find that Godin used a number\n\nthat did not belong to her, not that Godin knew it belonged to\n\nanother.\n\n            Because a rational fact-finder could not find beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that Godin knew that the false social security\n\nnumber was assigned to another person, we will reverse Godin’s\n\nconviction for aggravated identity theft under § 1028A(a)(1).\n\n                           IV.   Conclusion\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we reverse Godin’s conviction\n\nand remand with instructions to dismiss the aggravated identity\n\ntheft count in the indictment, and to vacate the sentence as to\n\nCount 17.\n\n\n\n                    -Concurring Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f            LYNCH,    Chief   Judge,    concurring.          I    concur    in    the\n\ncarefully reasoned panel opinion and wish to say a few words.\n\nUnder the aggravated identity theft statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1028A,\n\nCongress    created   a   crime   which   has   the    consequence         that   the\n\nconvicted defendant is given a mandatory consecutive sentence of\n\ntwo years in general, under § 1028A(a)(1), and five years in\n\nterrorism    offenses,    under   §    1028A(a)(2),     in       addition   to    the\n\nsentence for the underlying felony.          The statute itself shows how\n\nserious Congress was about increasing the mandatory sentence:\n\nsection 1028A(b) expressly cuts off most of the mechanisms through\n\nwhich such a sentence could be reduced.\n\n            Congress was responding to the drastic upsurge in what\n\nare called identity theft crimes and which encompass a variety of\n\nsituations.    The identity fraud statistics considered by Congress\n\nare staggering.       See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 108-528, at 4, as\n\nreprinted in 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. 779, 780 (\"[T]he loss to businesses\n\nand financial institutions from identity theft [is estimated] to be\n\n$47.6 billion.

The\n\nfirst is whether Congress intended this identify theft offense,\n\nmandating an enhanced sentence, to apply where the defendant knew\n\nfull   well    she   was      using,    without     lawful      authority,     an\n\nidentification which was not her own during a felony (here bank\n\nfraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1344), but did not know beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that the identification was that of another person.                     The\n\nsecond question is, if that was Congress's likely intent, whether\n\nCongress expressed that intent in the text of the statute in terms\n\nsufficiently clear that there is no occasion to resort to the rule\n\nof lenity, which operates in defendant's favor.\n\n           A   conviction     under    the    statute,    and   the   consequent\n\nmandatory sentence enhancement, requires a jury (or trier of fact)\n\nto find beyond a reasonable doubt that all of the statutory\n\nrequirements have been met.       Cf. Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S.\n\n466 (2000).    And so the issue has been framed as one of whether the\n\njury was correctly instructed that the knowledge needed was that\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fthe defendant \"knowingly used a means of identification without\n\nlawful authority,\" United States v. Godin, 489 F. Supp. 2d 118, 120\n\n(D. Me. 2007), or whether the knowledge needed also extended to the\n\nfact that the identification used was that of another person.\n\n          The circuit courts are divided on the issue.               Three\n\ncircuits and the district judge here would not extend the knowledge\n\nrequirement to the fact that the means of identification used was\n\nthat of an another person.        United States v. Mendoza-Gonzalez, 520\n\nF.3d 912, 915 (8th Cir. 2008); United States v. Hurtado, 508 F.3d\n\n603, 607 (11th Cir. 2007) cert. denied,       S. Ct. ___, 2008 WL 488011\n\n(June 9, 2008); United States v. Montejo, 442 F.3d 213, 214 (4th\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 366 (2006).\n\n          The     District   of   Columbia   Circuit,   United   States   v.\n\nVillanueva-Sotelo, 515 F.3d 1234, 1236 (D.C. Cir. 2008), and now\n\nthe panel here have concluded to the contrary: that the jury must\n\nbe charged that the defendant knew the means of identification used\n\nwas that of another person.\n\n          It would be beneficial if the Supreme Court resolved the\n\nmens rea issue.    The circuit conflict is certainly ripe.       And there\n\nare a large number of district court opinions on the issue.               The\n\nissue is important and affects a large number of cases and a large\n\nnumber of defendants.    For each of those defendants, an additional\n\nmandatory two-year sentence makes a great deal of difference.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\f            A large number of cases are involved.                      The range of\n\nunderlying felonies that can trigger this offense is broad.                            To\n\ngive but a few examples of the scope of the issue, this offense can\n\nbe charged when an unlawful means of identification is used in the\n\ncourse of Social Security fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(c)(11), passport\n\nfraud,    id.   §    1028A(c)(7),      theft   of       public      property,    id.    §\n\n1028A(c)(1),        fraud   in   the   acquisition        of    a   firearm,     id.   §\n\n1028A(c)(3),    citizenship       fraud,   id.      §    1028A(c)(2),      and   other\n\ncrimes.\n\n            I agree with the majority opinion that the terms of\n\n§ 1028A(a)(1), taken alone, are ambiguous.10                   Based on my reading,\n\nthe indications in the legislative history tend to support the\n\ndistrict court's interpretation that the term \"knowingly\" does not\n\nextend as far as knowledge that the means of identification used is\n\nthat of another person.           In the legislative history, there are\n\nreferences both to thefts of the identities of other persons and to\n\nthe use of false identifications, including (as here) use of Social\n\n\n\n     10\n          There are several other ambiguities which also may affect\nthe mens rea requirement.      One is what is meant by \"another\nperson.\" Presumably, the statute includes past persons as well as\nliving persons; it is also possible it was meant to include\nidentification such as Social Security numbers held in reserve for\nfuture persons.\n          In addition, the statute is not clear whether the means\nof identification must belong to another person, as the district\ncourt interpreted it, or whether the means of identification merely\nmust be based on the identity of another person. Those issues are\nnot before us. There is no question here that the Social Security\nnumber here belonged to the Maine resident.\n\n                                       -26-\n\fSecurity numbers.      See H.R. Rep. No. 108-528, at 5-6.               The\n\ndiscussion did not distinguish between the two, nor did it focus on\n\nthe mens rea issue which concerns us.           The opponents of the\n\nlegislation based their opposition on the mandatory nature of the\n\nsentences, and not on differing views of the mens rea requirement.\n\nSee 150 Cong. Rec. H4811 (statement of Rep. Scott).\n\n          It   would   be   quite   logical   for   Congress   to    impose\n\nadditional punishment when the means of a crime involves the use of\n\na false identity, both when the defendant knows the identification\n\nis \"of another person\" and when the defendant does not.             I doubt\n\nthat Congress would have intended, had it explicitly focused on the\n\nissue, to create an escape clause from the additional punishment\n\nfor felons who could not be shown to have known the identification\n\nthey used was that \"of another person.\"        It is not a stretch to\n\nconclude, as the district court did, that the purpose of the\n\nstatute encompassed the use of the Social Security number of an\n\ninnocent Maine resident whether the defendant knew the Social\n\nSecurity number was that person's or not.       Godin, 489 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 121.\n\n          Still, the text provides support for the other view.           In\n\nfavor of defendant's reading is the distinction in language between\n\nthe general offense in § 1028A(a)(1) and the terrorism offense in\n\n§ 1028A(a)(2), which could be read as explicitly covering knowing\n\nuse of both \"a means of identification of another person\" and \"a\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\ffalse identification document.\"        Congress could easily have used\n\nthe broader language of subsection (a)(2) in subsection (a)(1), but\n\ndid not.\n\n             In this situation, guidance may come from the Supreme\n\nCourt's latest opinion applying the rule of lenity, United States\n\nv. Santos, ___ U.S. ___, 128 S. Ct. 2020 (June 2, 2008).                    The\n\nplurality opinion stated that there was \"no more reason to think\"\n\nthat a key term in the statute that Congress had not defined meant\n\none thing over another.       Id. at 2025.    That is very close to this\n\ncase. Ultimately, Justice Stevens's opinion provided the necessary\n\nvote   for   a   majority   and   weighed   the   rule   of   lenity   in   the\n\ndetermination of the outcome where he believed Congress had left\n\nthe term undefined but he considered that Congress could not have\n\nintended a particular result. Id. at 2033 (Stevens, J., concurring\n\nin the judgment).     So too, here.\n\n             In the end, the Supreme Court may resolve this important\n\nquestion of interpretation of the present statute.            Alternatively,\n\nCongress may wish to clarify in new legislation the scope of the\n\nenhanced penalties.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -28-\n\f",

Vos, Assistant Federal Defender, with whom David Beneman, Federal Defender, was on brief for appellant.</p>\n<p>Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, and TASHIMA,<sup>[*]</sup> Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>TASHIMA, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Defendant-Appellant Cori A. Godin challenges her conviction for aggravated identity theft under 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1). The statute adds a mandatory two-year term of imprisonment to that otherwise provided for certain enumerated felonies if, \"during and in relation to\" the felony, the perpetrator \"knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1). The question before this court is how far the \"knowingly\" <i>mens rea</i> requirement extends. Must the defendant know that the means of identification belongs to another person? We conclude that the statute is ambiguous and that the legislative history does not clearly reveal congressional intent. Applying the rule of lenity, as we must, we hold that the \"knowingly\" <i>mens rea</i> requirement extends to \"of another person.\" In other words, to obtain a conviction under § 1028A(a)(1), the government must prove that the defendant knew <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> that the means of identification transferred, possessed, or used during the commission of an enumerated felony belonged to another person. The government did not do so here. Accordingly, we reverse Godin's conviction.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>In 2006, Godin defrauded eight banks and credit unions (collectively, the \"banks\"). She opened accounts using fabricated social security numbers, closed some accounts, and then deposited checks drawn on the closed accounts into the still open accounts. Godin then withdrew funds from the falsely inflated accounts. In this manner, Godin defrauded the banks of approximately $40,000.</p>\n<p>Godin fabricated seven different social security numbers by altering the fourth and fifth digits of her own social security number. Godin's social security number is 004-82-XXXX.<sup>[2]</sup> Of the seven fabricated numbers, only one, number 004-44-XXXX, belonged to another person. Godin opened an account at Bank of America with the fabricated 004-44-XXXX number but provided the bank with her correct name, address, date of birth, driver's license number, and telephone number.</p>\n<p>The government charged Godin in a seventeen-count indictment: six counts of bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1344, ten counts of social security fraud in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 408(a)(7)(B), and one count of aggravated identity theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1). In the aggravated identity theft count, Godin was charged with knowingly using social security number 004-44-XXXX during and in relation to one of the bank fraud counts (Count 4) and one of the social security fraud counts (Count 15).</p>\n<p>Godin moved to dismiss Count 17, the aggravated identity theft count, arguing that the government had to prove that she knew that the 004-44-XXXX social security number belonged to another person. The District Court denied the motion to dismiss, but declined to reach the <i>mens rea</i> issue. <i>United States v. Godin</i> (<i>Godin I</i>), 476 F.Supp.2d 1 (D.Me.2007). Noting that what Godin knew about the number remained a question of fact,<sup>[3]</sup> the District Court \"decline[d] to make an abstract decision on an issue that ultimately may not reflect the actual facts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 3.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, Godin pleaded guilty to the sixteen bank and social security fraud counts. Godin proceeded to trial only on Count 17, the aggravated identity theft count. At trial, Godin stipulated that she committed bank and social security fraud and that she knew that the social security numbers she used in relation to those felonies were not her own.</p>\n<p>The government called two witnesses. The first was employed by Bank of America and testified that Godin used number 004-44-XXXX to open an account but that she gave the bank her correct name, address, phone number, driver's license number, and date of birth. The government then called a Special Agent for the Social Security Administration (\"Agent\"). The Agent testified that by searching a secure and password-protected Social Security Administration database, he determined that social security number 004-44-XXXX was assigned to a man who resided in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> Maine.<sup>[4]</sup> The Agent also testified that he could not tell by looking at the number that it belonged to another person because there are millions of unassigned numbers. Godin did not dispute any of this evidence but put her true social security number, 004-82-XXXX, into evidence.</p>\n<p>After the government's case in chief, Godin moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29. She argued that the evidence was insufficient to support a verdict because the government presented no evidence to show that she knew the false number belonged to someone else. The District Court denied the motion. The District Court gave two reasons for its decision. First, the scienter issue remained unresolved. Second, the District Court believed that the jury could find that Godin knew the number belonged to someone else.</p>\n<p>Both parties debated the scienter requirement at a jury charge conference. While acknowledging that it was \"a close issue,\" the District Court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>To convict Cori Godin of this offense, the government must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<i>First,</i> Cori Godin committed bank fraud and/or social security fraud felony violations. The parties stipulate that she did so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<i>Second,</i> during and in relation to one or both of those other felony violations, Cori Godin knowingly used a means of identification without lawful authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<i>Third,</i> that means of identification belonged to another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Knowingly\" means that the act was done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of mistake or accident. The government must prove that Cori Godin knew that she did not have lawful authority to use the means of identification in question. The government is not required to prove that she knew the means of identification actually belonged to another person.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Godin</i> (<i>Godin II</i>), 489 F.Supp.2d 118, 119-20 (D.Me.2007).</p>\n<p>In explaining its decision, the District Court first noted that the language of § 1028A(a)(1) was \"not strongly persuasive in either direction,\" but permitted the District Court's reading. <i>Id.</i> at 120. Second, the weight of case law at that time favored a narrow scienter requirement. <i>Id.</i> Third, \"knowingly\" had to extend to \"means of identification\" because the statute requires that the defendant know that the means of identification is fraudulent. <i>Id.</i> Finally, the purpose of the statute, punishing \"identity theft,\" supported stopping the scienter requirement at \"means of identification\" and not extending it to \"of another person\" because the person whose number Godin used \"was a victim of identity theft, whether Godin knew that she was stealing his identity or not.\" <i>Id.</i> at 121.</p>\n<p>The jury returned a guilty verdict. Godin timely appeals, contending that the court charged the jury in error and that the evidence was insufficient to convict her of aggravated identity theft under § 1028A(a)(1).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Scienter Requirement</h2>\n<p>The circuits are divided on the issue of whether the \"knowingly\" scienter requirement in § 1028A(a)(1) extends to \"of another person.\" The Fourth, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits have concluded that it does not. <i>United States v. Mendoza-Gonzalez,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> 520 F.3d 912, 915 (8th Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Hurtado,</i> 508 F.3d 603, 607 (11th Cir.2007) <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2903, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2008); <i>United States v. Montejo,</i> 442 F.3d 213, 214 (4th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 366, 166 L.Ed.2d 138 (2006). The D.C. Circuit recently concluded, however, that it does. <i>United States v. Villanueva-Sotelo,</i> 515 F.3d 1234, 1236 (D.C.Cir.2008). We review de novo \"alleged jury instruction errors involving the interpretation of the elements of a statutory offense.\" <i>United States v. Soto-Beniquez,</i> 356 F.3d 1, 44-45 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>Our interpretive task begins with the statute's text. <i>United States v. Jimenez,</i> 507 F.3d 13, 19 (1st Cir.2007). We look to the plain meaning of the words in \"`the broader context of the statute as a whole.'\" <i>United States v. Roberson,</i> 459 F.3d 39, 51 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Mullane v. Chambers,</i> 333 F.3d 322, 330 (1st Cir.2003)). If the meaning of the text is unambiguous our task ends there as well. <i>Id.</i> If the statute is ambiguous, we look beyond the text to the legislative history in order to determine congressional intent. <i>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Darling's,</i> 444 F.3d 98, 108 (1st Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted). \"A statute is ambiguous only if it admits of more than one reasonable interpretation.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Thinking Machs. Corp. v. Mellon Fin. Servs. Corp. # 1</i> (<i>In re Thinking Machs. Corp.</i>), 67 F.3d 1021, 1025 (1st Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p>Section 1028A(a)(1) provides, in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote>Whoever, during and in relation to any felony violation enumerated in subsection (c), knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such felony, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years.</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1).<sup>[5]</sup> \"Knowingly,\" as an adverb, modifies the verbs \"transfers, possesses, or uses.\" The prepositional phrase \"without lawful authority\" is an adverb phrase that also modifies the verbs. \"Means\" is the direct object of the verbs, and the prepositional phrase \"of identification\" is an adjective phrase that modifies the direct object. Finally, the prepositional phrase \"of another person\" is an adjective phrase that modifies \"identification.\" Together, \"knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person\" is a participial phrase describing the subject \"whoever.\"</p>\n<p>The government argues that \"knowingly,\" because it is an adverb, modifies the verbs, and the Fourth, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits agree. <i>Mendoza-Gonzalez,</i> 520 F.3d at 915; <i>Hurtado,</i> 508 F.3d at 609; <i>Montejo,</i> 442 F.3d at 215. In a purely grammatical sense, \"knowingly,\" as an adverb, modifies only the verbs \"transfers, possesses, or uses.\" In interpreting § 1028A, however, we are not engaged in a purely grammatical exercise. In criminal statutes, adverbs that are also <i>mens rea</i> requirements frequently extend to non-verbs. <i>See </i><i>Villanueva-Sotelo,</i> 515 F.3d at 1238 (explaining that the term \"modify,\" when used in statutory interpretation, is better equated with the terms \"`apply,' `extend,' or `attach.'\"). Cases holding that \"knowingly\" extends to words and phrases other than verbs are legion. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Edgerton,</i> 510 F.3d 54, 57 (1st Cir.2007) (holding that a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(6) requires proof <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> that a defendant knowingly made <i>a false statement</i> when purchasing a firearm); <i>United States v. Leahy,</i> 473 F.3d 401, 408 (1st Cir.2007) (noting that 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), the felon-in-possession statute, requires knowing possession <i>of a firearm</i>); <i>United States v. Gonsalves,</i> 435 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir.2006) (affirming that 18 U.S.C. § 1001, making false statements to the government, requires that a defendant knowingly make <i>a false statement</i>); <i>United States v. Hussein,</i> 351 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir.2003) (noting that under 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), the government must prove that the defendant knowingly possessed <i>a controlled substance</i>).<sup>[6]</sup> Because we interpret a criminal statute and not an English textbook, we cannot say that the best or even most likely reading of § 1028A(a)(1) is to limit the adverb \"knowingly\" to the verbs it modifies.</p>\n<p>The Fourth Circuit also argues that \"knowingly\" only modifies the verbs \"transfers, possesses, or uses\" because, \"good usage\" requires that it be placed \"as close as possible to the words which it modifies.\" <i>Montejo,</i> 442 F.3d at 215 (internal citation omitted). Thus, the court concludes, \"knowingly\" cannot modify the entire \"lengthy\" phrase.<sup>[7]</sup><i>Id.</i> We are not persuaded by the Fourth Circuit's reasoning. The phrase is not very long (fifteen words out of a forty-seven word sentence), and it is one phrase out of four within the same sentence. There are three additional phrases <i>in the same sentence</i> to which \"of another person\" does not belong. It is as reasonable to read \"knowingly\" to extend to all of the words within the phrase it inhabits as it is to further divide the phrase and limit the reach of \"knowingly\" to just a portion of the phrase. <i>See </i><i>X-Citement Video,</i> 513 U.S. at 79, 115 S.Ct. 464 (Stevens, J., concurring) (\"In my opinion, the normal, commonsense reading of a subsection of a criminal statute introduced by the word `knowingly' is to treat that adverb as modifying each of the elements of the offense identified in the remainder of the subsection.\").</p>\n<p>Thus, we easily reach the conclusion that knowingly can extend beyond the verbs it directly modifies. The question still remains, however, does it extend to \"of another person\"?</p>\n<p>The District Court concluded that \"knowingly\" has to extend at least to \"a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> means of identification.\" <i>Godin II,</i> 489 F.Supp.2d at 120; <i>Godin I,</i> 476 F.Supp.2d at 2. We agree. Otherwise, the statute would criminalize the transfer, possession, or use of anything that contained a means of identification, <i>e.g.,</i> a package, even if the person charged did not know that the thing he or she transferred, possessed, or used contained a means of identification. As the District Court noted, such a result would be absurd.</p>\n<blockquote>If during a bank conspiracy, I hand a defendant a sealed envelope asking her to transfer it and its contents to another and she knowingly does so, she has knowingly transferred the envelope and its contents. But, if she believes my statement that the envelope contains only a birthday card when in fact it contains a forged social security card, the government surely would not contend that she should receive the enhanced penalty.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i>; <i>see also </i><i>Villanueva-Sotelo,</i> 515 F.3d at 1238 (reaching the same conclusion) (citing <i>Godin I,</i> 476 F.Supp.2d at 2).</p>\n<p>We are convinced our interpretation is correct to this point. We are also convinced that whether \"knowingly\" extends beyond \"means of identification\" to its modifier \"of another person\" is ambiguous. In coming to this conclusion we rely primarily on <i>Liparota v. United States,</i> 471 U.S. 419, 105 S.Ct. 2084, 85 L.Ed.2d 434 (1985), in which the Court concluded that the plain text of a similarly structured statute was ambiguous.</p>\n<p>The Court analyzed the reach of the scienter requirement in a food stamp statute that punished \"`[w]hoever knowingly uses, transfers, acquires, alters, or possesses coupons or authorization cards in any manner not authorized by this chapter or the regulations issued pursuant to this chapter.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 420 n. 1, 105 S.Ct. 2084 (quoting 7 U.S.C. § 2024(b)(1) (1982)). The government argued that \"knowingly\" did not extend to \"in any manner not authorized by this chapter or the regulations issued pursuant to this chapter.\" <i>Id.</i> at 421, 105 S.Ct. 2084. The Court concluded that the text could not answer the question. Either limiting knowingly to the verbs and their direct objects or extending it throughout the entire phrase \"would accord with ordinary usage.\" <i>Id.</i> at 424, 105 S.Ct. 2084.</p>\n<p>The Court then went a step further and explained that statutes constructed in this manner are generally ambiguous. As an example, the Court noted that the <i>mens rea</i> requirement in a statute punishing someone who \"knowingly sells a security without a permit\" cannot be determined by the plain text. <i>Id.</i> at 424-25 n. 7, 105 S.Ct. 2084 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). \"As a matter of grammar the statute is ambiguous; it is not at all clear how far down the sentence the word `knowingly' is intended to travel.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). We join with the D.C. Circuit and conclude that the text of § 1028A(a)(1) is ambiguous because the Court has determined that \"text alone cannot resolve statutes structured this way.\" <i>See </i><i>Villanueva-Sotelo,</i> 515 F.3d at 1241.</p>\n<p>Because the plain meaning of the text is not clear, \"we consider surrounding language and the statute's structure.\" <i>Jimenez,</i> 507 F.3d at 19. As we explained in <i>Jimenez,</i> § 1028A has \"two variations.\" <i>Id.</i> The jury convicted Godin under the first, § 1028A(a)(1). The second, § 1028A(a)(2), provides a harsher punishment for those who commit aggravated identity theft in relation to a \"terrorism offense.\"</p>\n<blockquote>Whoever, during and in relation to any [terrorism offense] knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> person <i>or a false identification document</i> shall in addition to the punishment provided for such felony, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 years.</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(2) (emphasis added). If \"knowingly\" reaches \"of another person\" in § 1028A(a)(2), then it should also stretch to \"of another person\" in § 1028A(a)(1).</p>\n<p>When arguing <i>Villanueva-Sotelo,</i> the government conceded that the scienter requirement in § 1028A(a)(2) extended to \"false identification document.\" <i>Villanueva-Sotelo,</i> 515 F.3d at 1239. Thus, in paragraph (2), \"knowingly\" can reasonably be read to extend to \"of another person\" because it reaches all the way to \"false identification document.\" <i>See id.</i> at 1239-40. We do not see that as the only plausible reading, however. A second reasonable interpretation is that \"knowingly\" only extends to the two direct objects and their primary modifiers: \"means of identification\" and \"false identification documents.\" Thus, the statute's structure does not resolve the ambiguity.</p>\n<p>We may also look to the title of a statute to resolve ambiguity in the text. <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 234, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Section 1028A is entitled \"Aggravated identity theft.\" As the D.C. Circuit noted, an element of theft is the intent to deprive another of property. <i>Villanueva-Sotelo,</i> 515 F.3d at 1243 (internal citations omitted). Thus, employing the D.C. Circuit's reasoning, \"knowingly\" must extend to \"of another person\" because, to convict someone of theft, the government must prove that the defendant knew he or she was taking something from another.</p>\n<p>We do not agree that the title resolves the ambiguity in the text. Congress' use of the word \"theft\" certainly supports the conclusion that \"knowingly\" extends to \"of another person\" and makes this interpretation eminently reasonable. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jahagirdar,</i> 466 F.3d 149, 153 (1st Cir.2006) (\"`[W]here Congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word . . . .'\") (quoting <i>Morissette v. United States,</i> 342 U.S. 246, 263, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952)). We do not believe, however, that the use of the word \"theft\" compels a broad scienter requirement. It is also plausible that Congress intended to define \"identity theft\" as <i>using</i> someone else's identity rather than <i>taking</i> someone else's identity. After all, the effect on a victim's credit rating is the same whether someone (1) makes up a social security number, procures credit with that number, and does not repay or (2) steals a social security number from a database, procures credit with that number, and does not repay. It is not clear that, by using the word \"theft,\" Congress intended to limit \"identity theft\" to the latter scenario.</p>\n<p>Because the structure and title of the statute do not resolve the ambiguity in the text, we turn next to the legislative history. <i>See </i><i>Darling's,</i> 444 F.3d at 108. Congress added § 1028A to the United States Code through the \"Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act,\" Pub.L. No. 108-275, 118 Stat. 831 (2004). The House Report accompanying the Act is replete with the terms \"theft\" and \"thieves.\" \"[T]he `Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act[ ]' addresses the growing problem of identity theft.\" H.R.Rep. No. 108-528, at 3, <i>as reprinted in</i> 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. 779, 780. One stated purpose of the statute is to increase sentences for \"identity thieves.\"<sup>[8]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> <i>Id.</i> The report also gives examples of identity theft that fit comfortably within the traditional definition of theft: a health club employee took credit-card and social security numbers from health club members; an individual \"stole\" identities from multiple people and then used the false identities to file false tax returns; a woman used a \"stolen identity\" to apply for social security benefits. <i>Id.</i> at 5-6, 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 781-82.</p>\n<p>From this emphasis on \"theft,\" the D.C. Circuit concluded that Congress intended only to punish \"thieves,\" or those who knowingly use another's identification. <i>Villanueva-Sotelo,</i> 515 F.3d at 1244-45. We agree that this is a reasonable reading of the legislative history. The problem is that one can also reasonably glean from the legislative history an intent to cover actions that do not fit the traditional definition of theft. The same House Report defines identity theft broadly: \"The terms `identity theft' and `identity fraud' refer to all types of crimes in which someone wrongfully obtains and uses another person's personal data. . . .\" H.R.Rep. No. 108-528, at 4, 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 780. \"All crimes\" could conceivably cover crimes that fall outside traditional theft. Indeed, several of the anecdotal examples of identity theft describe crimes that did not involve stealing a means of identification from another. In one case, a woman used her husband's social security number to collect disability benefits, and, in a similar case, a man used his brother-in-law's name and social security number to receive social security benefits. <i>Id.</i> at 6, 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 782. Neither of these cases describes a crime in which the defendant stole a means of identification from another; the only victim was the government. In another example, one closer to Godin's case, a woman received social security benefits using her social security number but used another's social security number to procure employment. <i>Id.</i> It is not clear whether or not the woman knew that the false number belonged to someone else.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the definition of \"identity theft\" given in the House Report encompasses the use of false identification to receive immigration benefits. <i>Id.</i> at 4, 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 780. If an undocumented immigrant purchases a social security number from a third party and uses that number to obtain employment, he or she may not know that it is assigned to another person. The third party may know that the number is a valid number, assigned to a real person, but the immigrant may not. Yet Congress arguably intended \"aggravated identity theft\" to cover both the crime committed by the third party and that committed by the undocumented immigrant.</p>\n<p>Congress' use of the term \"theft\" and the accompanying descriptive anecdotes in the legislative history do not clearly evince congressional intent. We remain unsure whether, in codifying § 1028A(a)(1), Congress intended to increase punishment for crimes in which a person knowingly uses a false means of identification without knowing that the identification belongs to another. Thus, we conclude that the legislative history does not resolve the statute's ambiguity.</p>\n<p>If a statute contains a \"grievous ambiguity,\" the ambiguity must be resolved <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> in the defendant's favor. <i>United States v. Councilman,</i> 418 F.3d 67, 83 (1st Cir.2005) (en banc); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Santos,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 2025, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008) (plurality opinion) (\"The rule of lenity requires ambiguous criminal laws to be interpreted in favor of the defendants subjected to them.\"). The rule of lenity \"`applies only if, after seizing everything from which aid can be derived, [a court] can make no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.'\" <i>Councilman,</i> 418 F.3d at 83 (alteration in original) (quoting <i>Reno v. Koray,</i> 515 U.S. 50, 65, 115 S.Ct. 2021, 132 L.Ed.2d 46 (1995)).</p>\n<p>Using all methods of statutory construction available to us, we are unable to ascertain whether Congress intended the \"knowingly\" <i>mens rea</i> requirement to extend to \"of another person.\" The language of § 1028A is ambiguous. The ambiguity cannot be resolved by the statutory structure, the title, or the legislative history. We hold that the rule of lenity applies, and the scienter requirement must stretch to \"of another person.\" Thus, the District Court instructed the jury in error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Sufficiency of the evidence</h2>\n<p>Generally, if an erroneous jury instruction is not harmless error, we vacate the conviction and remand for a new trial. In the present case, however, Godin also argues that the government presented insufficient evidence to support a conviction under § 1028A(a)(1). The two analyses differ as do the necessary outcomes. <i>United States v. Baldyga,</i> 233 F.3d 674, 679 n.3 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>When examining whether the omission of an element in a jury instruction is harmless error, we ask \"`whether the record contains evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect to the omitted element.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 682 (quoting <i>Neder v. United States,</i> 527 U.S. 1, 19, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999)). If the error is not harmless, we vacate the conviction and remand for a new trial. <i>Id.</i> at 679 n. 3. When examining the sufficiency of the evidence, we ask whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, \"a rational factfinder could find that the government proved the essential elements of its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Marin,</i> 523 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir.2008) (citing <i>United States v. Stark,</i> 499 F.3d 72, 79 (1st Cir.2007)). If we conclude the evidence is not sufficient to support a charge, we reverse the conviction and dismiss the charge. <i>Baldyga,</i> 233 F.3d at 679 n. 3. When a defendant raises both arguments, we address the sufficiency of the evidence first. If we conclude the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction, we then ask whether the jury instruction error was harmless. If we conclude that the evidence is not sufficient to support the conviction and that a motion to acquit should have been granted, that conclusion is dispositive and we need go no further. <i>See id.</i> at 682 n. 8 (explaining that a court may still find that an erroneous jury instruction constitutes reversible error after finding that evidence was sufficient to support the verdict); <i>United States v. St. Michael's Credit Union,</i> 880 F.2d 579, 588-89 (1st Cir.1989) (holding that evidence was sufficient to support the verdict but vacating conviction and remanding for jury trial because error in jury instruction was not harmless); <i>United States v. Sturm,</i> 870 F.2d 769, 775 (1st Cir.1989) (same); <i>United States v. Gens,</i> 493 F.2d 216, 223 (1st Cir.1974).<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> We review the denial of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal de novo. <i>United States v. Villafane-Jimenez,</i> 410 F.3d 74, 80 n. 6 (1st Cir.2005). In our review of the evidence presented at trial, we find nothing to support a finding that Godin knew that social security number 004-44-XXXX belonged to another person. The false number was identical to her own except for the fourth and fifth digits. The only inference a rational jury could make from this evidence is that Godin randomly selected the two fabricated numbers. The Agent testified that one cannot know just by looking at a number whether it is assigned to another person because there are millions of unassigned numbers. The Agent did not know that the number was assigned to another until he ran a search in a secure, password-protected database. The government presented no evidence showing that Godin had access to a similar database, knew the individual to whom the social security number belonged, or somehow accessed that person's information. The government concedes as much on appeal, arguing only that the evidence was sufficient for a jury to find that Godin used a number that did not belong to her, <i>not</i> that Godin knew it belonged to another.</p>\n<p>Because a rational fact-finder could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that Godin knew that the false social security number was assigned to another person, we will reverse Godin's conviction for aggravated identity theft under § 1028A(a)(1).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we reverse Godin's conviction and remand with instructions to dismiss the aggravated identity theft count in the indictment, and to vacate the sentence as to Count 17.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>I concur in the carefully reasoned panel opinion and wish to say a few words. Under the aggravated identity theft statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1028A, Congress created a crime which has the consequence that the convicted defendant is given a mandatory consecutive sentence of two years in general, under § 1028A(a)(1), and five years in terrorism offenses, under § 1028A(a)(2), in addition to the sentence for the underlying felony. The statute itself shows how serious Congress was about increasing the mandatory sentence: section 1028A(b) expressly cuts off most of the mechanisms through which such a sentence could be reduced.</p>\n<p>Congress was responding to the drastic upsurge in what are called identity theft crimes and which encompass a variety of situations. The identity fraud statistics considered by Congress are staggering. <i>See, e.g.,</i> H.R.Rep. No. 108-528, at 4, <i>as reprinted in</i> 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. 779, 780 (\"[T]he loss to businesses and financial institutions from identity theft [is estimated] to be $47.6 billion. The costs to individual consumers are estimated to be approximately $5.0 billion.\"); <i>id.</i> at 25 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> (statement of Rep. Coble) (\"In 2002, the FTC received 161,819 victim complaints of compromised personal information. ... [These] victims have a difficult time consuming [sic] an expensive task of repairing a damaged credit history as well as their respective reputations.\"); <i>id.</i> at 35 (statement of Rep. Scott) (\"[T]he FTC reports [consumer identity theft] bilked almost 30 million Americans out of approximately $50 billion over the last 5 years, with about $5 billion of that out-of-pocket, unrecovered losses to consumers.\"); <i>id.</i> at 44 (statement of Rep. Jackson Lee) (\"Identity theft victims now spend an average of 600 hours  often over a period of years  recovering from the crime. Being a victim costs an average of $1,400 in out-of-pocket expenses....\").</p>\n<p>I view this appeal as presenting two basic queries. The first is whether Congress intended this identify theft offense, mandating an enhanced sentence, to apply where the defendant knew full well she was using, without lawful authority, an identification which was not her own during a felony (here bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1344), but did not know beyond a reasonable doubt that the identification was that of another person. The second question is, if that was Congress's likely intent, whether Congress expressed that intent in the text of the statute in terms sufficiently clear that there is no occasion to resort to the rule of lenity, which operates in defendant's favor.</p>\n<p>A conviction under the statute, and the consequent mandatory sentence enhancement, requires a jury (or trier of fact) to find beyond a reasonable doubt that all of the statutory requirements have been met. <i>Cf. </i><i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). And so the issue has been framed as one of whether the jury was correctly instructed that the knowledge needed was that the defendant \"knowingly used a means of identification without lawful authority,\" <i>United States v. Godin,</i> 489 F.Supp.2d 118, 120 (D.Me.2007), or whether the knowledge needed also extended to the fact that the identification used was that of another person.</p>\n<p>The circuit courts are divided on the issue. Three circuits and the district judge here would not extend the knowledge requirement to the fact that the means of identification used was that of an another person. <i>United States v. Mendoza-Gonzalez,</i> 520 F.3d 912, 915 (8th Cir. 2008); <i>United States v. Hurtado,</i> 508 F.3d 603, 607 (11th Cir.2007) <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2903, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2008); <i>United States v. Montejo,</i> 442 F.3d 213, 214 (4th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 366, 166 L.Ed.2d 138 (2006).</p>\n<p>The District of Columbia Circuit, <i>United States v. Villanueva-Sotelo,</i> 515 F.3d 1234, 1236 (D.C.Cir.2008), and now the panel here have concluded to the contrary: that the jury must be charged that the defendant knew the means of identification used was that of another person.</p>\n<p>It would be beneficial if the Supreme Court resolved the mens rea issue. The circuit conflict is certainly ripe. And there are a large number of district court opinions on the issue. The issue is important and affects a large number of cases and a large number of defendants. For each of those defendants, an additional mandatory two-year sentence makes a great deal of difference.</p>\n<p>A large number of cases are involved. The range of underlying felonies that can trigger this offense is broad. To give but a few examples of the scope of the issue, this offense can be charged when an unlawful means of identification is used in the course of Social Security fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(c)(11), passport fraud, <i>id.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> § 1028A(c)(7), theft of public property, <i>id.</i> § 1028A(c)(1), fraud in the acquisition of a firearm, <i>id.</i> § 1028A(c)(3), citizenship fraud, <i>id.</i> § 1028A(c)(2), and other crimes.</p>\n<p>I agree with the majority opinion that the terms of § 1028A(a)(1), taken alone, are ambiguous.<sup>[10]</sup> Based on my reading, the indications in the legislative history tend to support the district court's interpretation that the term \"knowingly\" does not extend as far as knowledge that the means of identification used is that of another person. In the legislative history, there are references both to thefts of the identities of other persons and to the use of false identifications, including (as here) use of Social Security numbers. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 108-528, at 5-6, 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. 779, 780. The discussion did not distinguish between the two, nor did it focus on the mens rea issue which concerns us. The opponents of the legislation based their opposition on the mandatory nature of the sentences, and not on differing views of the mens rea requirement. <i>See</i> 150 Cong. Rec. H4811 (statement of Rep. Scott).</p>\n<p>It would be quite logical for Congress to impose additional punishment when the means of a crime involves the use of a false identity, both when the defendant knows the identification is \"of another person\" and when the defendant does not. I doubt that Congress would have intended, had it explicitly focused on the issue, to create an escape clause from the additional punishment for felons who could not be shown to have known the identification they used was that \"of another person.\" It is not a stretch to conclude, as the district court did, that the purpose of the statute encompassed the use of the Social Security number of an innocent Maine resident whether the defendant knew the Social Security number was that person's or not. <i>Godin,</i> 489 F.Supp.2d at 121.</p>\n<p>Still, the text provides support for the other view. In favor of defendant's reading is the distinction in language between the general offense in § 1028A(a)(1) and the terrorism offense in § 1028A(a)(2), which could be read as explicitly covering knowing use of both \"a means of identification of another person\" and \"a false identification document.\" Congress could easily have used the broader language of subsection (a)(2) in subsection (a)(1), but did not.</p>\n<p>In this situation, guidance may come from the Supreme Court's latest opinion applying the rule of lenity, <i>United States v. Santos,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008). The plurality opinion stated that there was \"no more reason to think\" that a key term in the statute that Congress had not defined meant one thing over another. <i>Id.</i> at 2025. That is very close to this case. Ultimately, Justice Stevens's opinion provided the necessary vote for a majority and weighed the rule of lenity in the determination of the outcome where he believed Congress had left the term undefined but he considered that Congress could not have intended a particular result. <i>Id.</i> at 2033 (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment). So too, here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> In the end, the Supreme Court may resolve this important question of interpretation of the present statute. Alternatively, Congress may wish to clarify in new legislation the scope of the enhanced penalties.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.</p>\n<p>[2]  We redact the last four digits of each social security number for the sake of privacy.</p>\n<p>[3]  In opposing the motion to dismiss, the government argued \"that it [was] simply incredible for the Defendant to claim that there was no way she could have known at least one of these numbers . . . was assigned to another individual.\" <i>Godin I,</i> 476 F.Supp.2d at 3.</p>\n<p>[4]  The record does not reveal the individual's name.</p>\n<p>[5]  Among the felonies enumerated in § 1028A(c) are social security fraud and bank fraud. 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(c)(4) &amp; (5).\n</p>\n<p>A social security number is a \"means of identification.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1028(d)(7)(A).</p>\n<p>[6]  In <i>United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.,</i> 513 U.S. 64, 115 S.Ct. 464, 130 L.Ed.2d 372 (1994), on which both parties rely, the Supreme Court applied a \"knowingly\" scienter requirement to non-verbs in a child pornography statute. We find this case to be inapposite. The statute at issue provided punishment for, in relevant part, \"`[a]ny person who [ ] knowingly transports or ships . . . any visual depiction, if-[] the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 67-68, 115 S.Ct. 464 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 2252 (1988 ed. and Supp. V)). The Court extended \"knowingly\" beyond the verbs it directly modified to \"the use of a minor\" because there is a \"presumption in favor of a scienter requirement . . . [for] each of the statutory elements that criminalize otherwise innocent conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 72, 115 S.Ct. 464. Here, \"of another person\" is not an element that criminalizes otherwise innocent conduct, so the presumption does not apply. <i>X-Citement Video,</i> however, does not instruct us that we may only extend a scienter requirement to an element of a crime when there is such a presumption. Thus, it does not speak directly to our case.</p>\n<p>[7]  The Fourth Circuit appears to have mistakenly referred to the phrase in question as a predicate. <i>See </i><i>Montejo,</i> 442 F.3d at 215. The predicate in 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1), however, is \"shall . . . be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years.\" <i>See</i> The Chicago Manual of Style 5.23 (15th ed.2003) (defining predicate as \"the part that contains a verb and makes an assertion about the subject\" and providing examples). Our phrase is a participial phrase because it begins with a participle and modifies the subject \"whoever.\" <i>See Id.</i> at 5.109.</p>\n<p>[8]  In <i>Jimenez,</i> we noted that another purpose of the aggravated identity theft statute is to deter the use of real identifications during the commission of a crime because real identifications provide better cover than false identifications. <i>Jimenez,</i> 507 F.3d at 20. We do not question this explanation of the purpose of the statute, but we do not find it relevant to the current discussion. Those who use real identification so that their crimes will be harder to detect generally know that the identification belongs to another person.</p>\n<p>[9]  In <i>Gens,</i> the defendants were charged with eight counts of willfully misapplying funds from a federally-insured bank. <i>Gens,</i> 493 F.2d at 217. The defendants executed a scheme in which the two defendants who controlled the bank loaned money to debtors who then gave the funds to a third defendant. <i>Id.</i> at 218-19. The district court instructed the jury that, to reach a guilty verdict, they needed only to find that the defendants knew that loan proceeds were going to a person other than the debtors. <i>Id.</i> at 221. We held that this was error because the government also had to show that the defendants knew that the debtors would not repay. <i>Id.</i> at 222. We reversed the defendants' convictions on seven of the eight counts because substantial evidence did not support a finding of willful misapplication. <i>Id.</i> at 223. On the eighth count, we vacated the conviction and remanded for a new trial because the government had presented sufficient evidence for a jury to find that the defendants knew that the debtor on one of the loans would not repay. <i>Id.</i> at 223-24.</p>\n<p>[10]  There are several other ambiguities which also may affect the mens rea requirement. One is what is meant by \"another person.\" Presumably, the statute includes past persons as well as living persons; it is also possible it was meant to include identification such as Social Security numbers held in reserve for future persons.\n</p>\n<p>In addition, the statute is not clear whether the means of identification must <i>belong</i> to another person, as the district court interpreted it, or whether the means of identification merely must be based on the identity of another person. Those issues are not before us. There is no question here that the Social Security number here belonged to the Maine resident.</p>\n\n</div>",

The question before this court is how far the \"knowingly\" <i>mens rea</i> requirement extends. Must the defendant know that the means of identification belongs to another person? We conclude that the statute is ambiguous and that the legislative history does not clearly reveal congressional intent. Applying the rule of lenity, as we must, we hold that the \"knowingly\" <i>mens rea</i> requirement extends to \"of another person.\" In other words, to obtain a conviction under § 1028A(a)(1), the government must prove that the defendant knew <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> that the means of identification transferred, possessed, or used during the commission of an enumerated felony belonged to another person. The government did not do so here. Accordingly, we reverse Godin's conviction.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>In 2006, Godin defrauded eight banks and credit unions (collectively, the \"banks\"). She opened accounts using fabricated social security numbers, closed some accounts, and then deposited checks drawn on the closed accounts into the still open accounts. Godin then withdrew funds from the falsely inflated accounts. In this manner, Godin defrauded the banks of approximately $40,000.</p>\n<p>Godin fabricated seven different social security numbers by altering the fourth and fifth digits of her own social security number. Godin's social security number is 004-82-XXXX.<sup>[2]</sup> Of the seven fabricated numbers, only one, number 004-44-XXXX, belonged to another person. Godin opened an account at Bank of America with the fabricated 004-44-XXXX number but provided the bank with her correct name, address, date of birth, driver's license number, and telephone number.</p>\n<p>The government charged Godin in a seventeen-count indictment: six counts of bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1344, ten counts of social security fraud in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 408(a)(7)(B), and one count of aggravated identity theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1). In the aggravated identity theft count, Godin was charged with knowingly using social security number 004-44-XXXX during and in relation to one of the bank fraud counts (Count 4) and one of the social security fraud counts (Count 15).</p>\n<p>Godin moved to dismiss Count 17, the aggravated identity theft count, arguing that the government had to prove that she knew that the 004-44-XXXX social security number belonged to another person. The District Court denied the motion to dismiss, but declined to reach the <i>mens rea</i> issue. <i>United States v. Godin</i> (<i>Godin I</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2417698\"><a href=\"/opinion/2417698/united-states-v-godin/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (D.Me.2007). Noting that what Godin knew about the number remained a question of fact,<sup>[3]</sup> the District Court \"decline[d] to make an abstract decision on an issue that ultimately may not reflect the actual facts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 3.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, Godin pleaded guilty to the sixteen bank and social security fraud counts. Godin proceeded to trial only on Count 17, the aggravated identity theft count. At trial, Godin stipulated that she committed bank and social security fraud and that she knew that the social security numbers she used in relation to those felonies were not her own.</p>\n<p>The government called two witnesses. The first was employed by Bank of America and testified that Godin used number 004-44-XXXX to open an account but that she gave the bank her correct name, address, phone number, driver's license number, and date of birth. The government then called a Special Agent for the Social Security Administration (\"Agent\"). The Agent testified that by searching a secure and password-protected Social Security Administration database, he determined that social security number 004-44-XXXX was assigned to a man who resided in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> Maine.<sup>[4]</sup> The Agent also testified that he could not tell by looking at the number that it belonged to another person because there are millions of unassigned numbers. Godin did not dispute any of this evidence but put her true social security number, 004-82-XXXX, into evidence.</p>\n<p>After the government's case in chief, Godin moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29. She argued that the evidence was insufficient to support a verdict because the government presented no evidence to show that she knew the false number belonged to someone else. The District Court denied the motion. The District Court gave two reasons for its decision. First, the scienter issue remained unresolved. Second, the District Court believed that the jury could find that Godin knew the number belonged to someone else.</p>\n<p>Both parties debated the scienter requirement at a jury charge conference. While acknowledging that it was \"a close issue,\" the District Court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>To convict Cori Godin of this offense, the government must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<i>First,</i> Cori Godin committed bank fraud and/or social security fraud felony violations. The parties stipulate that she did so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<i>Second,</i> during and in relation to one or both of those other felony violations, Cori Godin knowingly used a means of identification without lawful authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<i>Third,</i> that means of identification belonged to another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Knowingly\" means that the act was done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of mistake or accident. The government must prove that Cori Godin knew that she did not have lawful authority to use the means of identification in question. The government is not required to prove that she knew the means of identification actually belonged to another person.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Godin</i> (<i>Godin II</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2415591\"><a href=\"/opinion/2415591/united-states-v-godin/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span>, 119-20 (D.Me.2007).</p>\n<p>In explaining its decision, the District Court first noted that the language of § 1028A(a)(1) was \"not strongly persuasive in either direction,\" but permitted the District Court's reading. <i>Id.</i> at 120. Second, the weight of case law at that time favored a narrow scienter requirement. <i>Id.</i> Third, \"knowingly\" had to extend to \"means of identification\" because the statute requires that the defendant know that the means of identification is fraudulent. <i>Id.</i> Finally, the purpose of the statute, punishing \"identity theft,\" supported stopping the scienter requirement at \"means of identification\" and not extending it to \"of another person\" because the person whose number Godin used \"was a victim of identity theft, whether Godin knew that she was stealing his identity or not.\" <i>Id.</i> at 121.</p>\n<p>The jury returned a guilty verdict. Godin timely appeals, contending that the court charged the jury in error and that the evidence was insufficient to convict her of aggravated identity theft under § 1028A(a)(1).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Scienter Requirement</h2>\n<p>The circuits are divided on the issue of whether the \"knowingly\" scienter requirement in § 1028A(a)(1) extends to \"of another person.\" The Fourth, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits have concluded that it does not. <i>United States v.

If the meaning of the text is unambiguous our task ends there as well. <i>Id.</i> If the statute is ambiguous, we look beyond the text to the legislative history in order to determine congressional intent. <i>Gen.

Finally, the prepositional phrase \"of another person\" is an adjective phrase that modifies \"identification.\" Together, \"knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person\" is a participial phrase describing the subject \"whoever.\"</p>\n<p>The government argues that \"knowingly,\" because it is an adverb, modifies the verbs, and the Fourth, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits agree. <i>Mendoza-Gonzalez,</i> 520 F.3d at 915; <i>Hurtado,</i> 508 F.3d at 609; <i>Montejo,</i> 442 F.3d at 215. In a purely grammatical sense, \"knowingly,\" as an adverb, modifies only the verbs \"transfers, possesses, or uses.\" In interpreting § 1028A, however, we are not engaged in a purely grammatical exercise. In criminal statutes, adverbs that are also <i>mens rea</i> requirements frequently extend to non-verbs. <i>See </i><i>Villanueva-Sotelo,</i> 515 F.3d at 1238 (explaining that the term \"modify,\" when used in statutory interpretation, is better equated with the terms \"`apply,' `extend,' or `attach.'\").

Thus, the court concludes, \"knowingly\" cannot modify the entire \"lengthy\" phrase.<sup>[7]</sup><i>Id.</i> We are not persuaded by the Fourth Circuit's reasoning. The phrase is not very long (fifteen words out of a forty-seven word sentence), and it is one phrase out of four within the same sentence. There are three additional phrases <i>in the same sentence</i> to which \"of another person\" does not belong. It is as reasonable to read \"knowingly\" to extend to all of the words within the phrase it inhabits as it is to further divide the phrase and limit the reach of \"knowingly\" to just a portion of the phrase. <i>See </i><i>X-Citement Video,</i> 513 U.S. at 79, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117881\"><a href=\"/opinion/117881/united-states-v-x-citement-video-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The question still remains, however, does it extend to \"of another person\"?</p>\n<p>The District Court concluded that \"knowingly\" has to extend at least to \"a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> means of identification.\" <i>Godin II,</i> 489 F.Supp.2d at 120; <i>Godin I,</i> 476 F.Supp.2d at 2. We agree. Otherwise, the statute would criminalize the transfer, possession, or use of anything that contained a means of identification, <i>e.g.,</i> a package, even if the person charged did not know that the thing he or she transferred, possessed, or used contained a means of identification. As the District Court noted, such a result would be absurd.</p>\n<blockquote>If during a bank conspiracy, I hand a defendant a sealed envelope asking her to transfer it and its contents to another and she knowingly does so, she has knowingly transferred the envelope and its contents. But, if she believes my statement that the envelope contains only a birthday card when in fact it contains a forged social security card, the government surely would not contend that she should receive the enhanced penalty.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i>; <i>see also </i><i>Villanueva-Sotelo,</i> 515 F.3d at 1238 (reaching the same conclusion) (citing <i>Godin I,</i> 476 F.Supp.2d at 2).</p>\n<p>We are convinced our interpretation is correct to this point. We are also convinced that whether \"knowingly\" extends beyond \"means of identification\" to its modifier \"of another person\" is ambiguous. In coming to this conclusion we rely primarily on <i>Liparota v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111425\"><a href=\"/opinion/111425/liparota-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111425\"><a href=\"/opinion/111425/liparota-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span> (1985), in which the Court concluded that the plain text of a similarly structured statute was ambiguous.</p>\n<p>The Court analyzed the reach of the scienter requirement in a food stamp statute that punished \"`[w]hoever knowingly uses, transfers, acquires, alters, or possesses coupons or authorization cards in any manner not authorized by this chapter or the regulations issued pursuant to this chapter.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 420 n. 1, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111425\"><a href=\"/opinion/111425/liparota-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2084</span></a></span> (quoting 7 U.S.C. § 2024(b)(1) (1982)). The government argued that \"knowingly\" did not extend to \"in any manner not authorized by this chapter or the regulations issued pursuant to this chapter.\" <i>Id.</i> at 421, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111425\"><a href=\"/opinion/111425/liparota-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2084</span></a></span>. The Court concluded that the text could not answer the question. Either limiting knowingly to the verbs and their direct objects or extending it throughout the entire phrase \"would accord with ordinary usage.\" <i>Id.</i> at 424, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111425\"><a href=\"/opinion/111425/liparota-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2084</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court then went a step further and explained that statutes constructed in this manner are generally ambiguous. As an example, the Court noted that the <i>mens rea</i> requirement in a statute punishing someone who \"knowingly sells a security without a permit\" cannot be determined by the plain text. <i>Id.</i> at 424-25 n. 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111425\"><a href=\"/opinion/111425/liparota-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2084</span></a></span> (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). \"As a matter of grammar the statute is ambiguous; it is not at all clear how far down the sentence the word `knowingly' is intended to travel.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). We join with the D.C. Circuit and conclude that the text of § 1028A(a)(1) is ambiguous because the Court has determined that \"text alone cannot resolve statutes structured this way.\" <i>See </i><i>Villanueva-Sotelo,</i> 515 F.3d at 1241.</p>\n<p>Because the plain meaning of the text is not clear, \"we consider surrounding language and the statute's structure.\" <i>Jimenez,</i> 507 F.3d at 19. As we explained in <i>Jimenez,</i> § 1028A has \"two variations.\" <i>Id.</i> The jury convicted Godin under the first, § 1028A(a)(1). The second, § 1028A(a)(2), provides a harsher punishment for those who commit aggravated identity theft in relation to a \"terrorism offense.\"</p>\n<blockquote>Whoever, during and in relation to any [terrorism offense] knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> person <i>or a false identification document</i> shall in addition to the punishment provided for such felony, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 years.</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(2) (emphasis added). If \"knowingly\" reaches \"of another person\" in § 1028A(a)(2), then it should also stretch to \"of another person\" in § 1028A(a)(1).</p>\n<p>When arguing <i>Villanueva-Sotelo,</i> the government conceded that the scienter requirement in § 1028A(a)(2) extended to \"false identification document.\" <i>Villanueva-Sotelo,</i> 515 F.3d at 1239. Thus, in paragraph (2), \"knowingly\" can reasonably be read to extend to \"of another person\" because it reaches all the way to \"false identification document.\" <i>See id.</i> at 1239-40. We do not see that as the only plausible reading, however. A second reasonable interpretation is that \"knowingly\" only extends to the two direct objects and their primary modifiers: \"means of identification\" and \"false identification documents.\" Thus, the statute's structure does not resolve the ambiguity.</p>\n<p>We may also look to the title of a statute to resolve ambiguity in the text. <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 234, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span> (1998). Section 1028A is entitled \"Aggravated identity theft.\" As the D.C. Circuit noted, an element of theft is the intent to deprive another of property. <i>Villanueva-Sotelo,</i> 515 F.3d at 1243 (internal citations omitted). Thus, employing the D.C. Circuit's reasoning, \"knowingly\" must extend to \"of another person\" because, to convict someone of theft, the government must prove that the defendant knew he or she was taking something from another.</p>\n<p>We do not agree that the title resolves the ambiguity in the text. Congress' use of the word \"theft\" certainly supports the conclusion that \"knowingly\" extends to \"of another person\" and makes this interpretation eminently reasonable. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jahagirdar,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></span>, 153 (1st Cir.2006) (\"`[W]here Congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word . . . .'\") (quoting <i>Morissette v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104952\"><a href=\"/opinion/104952/morissette-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span>, 263, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104952\"><a href=\"/opinion/104952/morissette-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span> (1952)). We do not believe, however, that the use of the word \"theft\" compels a broad scienter requirement. It is also plausible that Congress intended to define \"identity theft\" as <i>using</i> someone else's identity rather than <i>taking</i> someone else's identity. After all, the effect on a victim's credit rating is the same whether someone (1) makes up a social security number, procures credit with that number, and does not repay or (2) steals a social security number from a database, procures credit with that number, and does not repay. It is not clear that, by using the word \"theft,\" Congress intended to limit \"identity theft\" to the latter scenario.</p>\n<p>Because the structure and title of the statute do not resolve the ambiguity in the text, we turn next to the legislative history. <i>See </i><i>Darling's,</i> 444 F.3d at 108. Congress added § 1028A to the United States Code through the \"Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act,\" Pub.L. No. 108-275, 118 Stat. 831 (2004). The House Report accompanying the Act is replete with the terms \"theft\" and \"thieves.\" \"[T]he `Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act[ ]' addresses the growing problem of identity theft.\" H.R.Rep. No. 108-528, at 3, <i>as reprinted in</i> 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. 779, 780. One stated purpose of the statute is to increase sentences for \"identity thieves.\"<sup>[8]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> <i>Id.</i> The report also gives examples of identity theft that fit comfortably within the traditional definition of theft: a health club employee took credit-card and social security numbers from health club members; an individual \"stole\" identities from multiple people and then used the false identities to file false tax returns; a woman used a \"stolen identity\" to apply for social security benefits. <i>Id.</i> at 5-6, 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 781-82.</p>\n<p>From this emphasis on \"theft,\" the D.C. Circuit concluded that Congress intended only to punish \"thieves,\" or those who knowingly use another's identification. <i>Villanueva-Sotelo,</i> 515 F.3d at 1244-45. We agree that this is a reasonable reading of the legislative history. The problem is that one can also reasonably glean from the legislative history an intent to cover actions that do not fit the traditional definition of theft. The same House Report defines identity theft broadly: \"The terms `identity theft' and `identity fraud' refer to all types of crimes in which someone wrongfully obtains and uses another person's personal data. . . .\" H.R.Rep. No. 108-528, at 4, 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 780. \"All crimes\" could conceivably cover crimes that fall outside traditional theft. Indeed, several of the anecdotal examples of identity theft describe crimes that did not involve stealing a means of identification from another. In one case, a woman used her husband's social security number to collect disability benefits, and, in a similar case, a man used his brother-in-law's name and social security number to receive social security benefits. <i>Id.</i> at 6, 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 782. Neither of these cases describes a crime in which the defendant stole a means of identification from another; the only victim was the government. In another example, one closer to Godin's case, a woman received social security benefits using her social security number but used another's social security number to procure employment. <i>Id.</i> It is not clear whether or not the woman knew that the false number belonged to someone else.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the definition of \"identity theft\" given in the House Report encompasses the use of false identification to receive immigration benefits. <i>Id.</i> at 4, 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 780. If an undocumented immigrant purchases a social security number from a third party and uses that number to obtain employment, he or she may not know that it is assigned to another person. The third party may know that the number is a valid number, assigned to a real person, but the immigrant may not. Yet Congress arguably intended \"aggravated identity theft\" to cover both the crime committed by the third party and that committed by the undocumented immigrant.</p>\n<p>Congress' use of the term \"theft\" and the accompanying descriptive anecdotes in the legislative history do not clearly evince congressional intent. We remain unsure whether, in codifying § 1028A(a)(1), Congress intended to increase punishment for crimes in which a person knowingly uses a false means of identification without knowing that the identification belongs to another. Thus, we conclude that the legislative history does not resolve the statute's ambiguity.</p>\n<p>If a statute contains a \"grievous ambiguity,\" the ambiguity must be resolved <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> in the defendant's favor. <i>United States v.

In our review of the evidence presented at trial, we find nothing to support a finding that Godin knew that social security number 004-44-XXXX belonged to another person. The false number was identical to her own except for the fourth and fifth digits. The only inference a rational jury could make from this evidence is that Godin randomly selected the two fabricated numbers. The Agent testified that one cannot know just by looking at a number whether it is assigned to another person because there are millions of unassigned numbers. The Agent did not know that the number was assigned to another until he ran a search in a secure, password-protected database. The government presented no evidence showing that Godin had access to a similar database, knew the individual to whom the social security number belonged, or somehow accessed that person's information. The government concedes as much on appeal, arguing only that the evidence was sufficient for a jury to find that Godin used a number that did not belong to her, <i>not</i> that Godin knew it belonged to another.</p>\n<p>Because a rational fact-finder could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that Godin knew that the false social security number was assigned to another person, we will reverse Godin's conviction for aggravated identity theft under § 1028A(a)(1).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we reverse Godin's conviction and remand with instructions to dismiss the aggravated identity theft count in the indictment, and to vacate the sentence as to Count 17.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>I concur in the carefully reasoned panel opinion and wish to say a few words. Under the aggravated identity theft statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1028A, Congress created a crime which has the consequence that the convicted defendant is given a mandatory consecutive sentence of two years in general, under § 1028A(a)(1), and five years in terrorism offenses, under § 1028A(a)(2), in addition to the sentence for the underlying felony. The statute itself shows how serious Congress was about increasing the mandatory sentence: section 1028A(b) expressly cuts off most of the mechanisms through which such a sentence could be reduced.</p>\n<p>Congress was responding to the drastic upsurge in what are called identity theft crimes and which encompass a variety of situations. The identity fraud statistics considered by Congress are staggering. <i>See, e.g.,</i> H.R.Rep. No. 108-528, at 4, <i>as reprinted in</i> 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. 779, 780 (\"[T]he loss to businesses and financial institutions from identity theft [is estimated] to be $47.6 billion. The costs to individual consumers are estimated to be approximately $5.0 billion.\"); <i>id.</i> at 25 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> (statement of Rep. Coble) (\"In 2002, the FTC received 161,819 victim complaints of compromised personal information. ... [These] victims have a difficult time consuming [sic] an expensive task of repairing a damaged credit history as well as their respective reputations.\"); <i>id.</i> at 35 (statement of Rep. Scott) (\"[T]he FTC reports [consumer identity theft] bilked almost 30 million Americans out of approximately $50 billion over the last 5 years, with about $5 billion of that out-of-pocket, unrecovered losses to consumers.\"); <i>id.</i> at 44 (statement of Rep. Jackson Lee) (\"Identity theft victims now spend an average of 600 hours  often over a period of years  recovering from the crime. Being a victim costs an average of $1,400 in out-of-pocket expenses....\").</p>\n<p>I view this appeal as presenting two basic queries. The first is whether Congress intended this identify theft offense, mandating an enhanced sentence, to apply where the defendant knew full well she was using, without lawful authority, an identification which was not her own during a felony (here bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1344), but did not know beyond a reasonable doubt that the identification was that of another person. The second question is, if that was Congress's likely intent, whether Congress expressed that intent in the text of the statute in terms sufficiently clear that there is no occasion to resort to the rule of lenity, which operates in defendant's favor.</p>\n<p>A conviction under the statute, and the consequent mandatory sentence enhancement, requires a jury (or trier of fact) to find beyond a reasonable doubt that all of the statutory requirements have been met. <i>Cf. </i><i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (2000). And so the issue has been framed as one of whether the jury was correctly instructed that the knowledge needed was that the defendant \"knowingly used a means of identification without lawful authority,\" <i>United States v. Godin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2415591\"><a href=\"/opinion/2415591/united-states-v-godin/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Villanueva-Sotelo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187094\"><a href=\"/opinion/187094/united-states-v-villanueva-sotelo/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1234</span></a></span>, 1236 (D.C.Cir.2008), and now the panel here have concluded to the contrary: that the jury must be charged that the defendant knew the means of identification used was that of another person.</p>\n<p>It would be beneficial if the Supreme Court resolved the mens rea issue. The circuit conflict is certainly ripe. And there are a large number of district court opinions on the issue. The issue is important and affects a large number of cases and a large number of defendants. For each of those defendants, an additional mandatory two-year sentence makes a great deal of difference.</p>\n<p>A large number of cases are involved. The range of underlying felonies that can trigger this offense is broad. To give but a few examples of the scope of the issue, this offense can be charged when an unlawful means of identification is used in the course of Social Security fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(c)(11), passport fraud, <i>id.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> § 1028A(c)(7), theft of public property, <i>id.</i> § 1028A(c)(1), fraud in the acquisition of a firearm, <i>id.</i> § 1028A(c)(3), citizenship fraud, <i>id.</i> § 1028A(c)(2), and other crimes.</p>\n<p>I agree with the majority opinion that the terms of § 1028A(a)(1), taken alone, are ambiguous.<sup>[10]</sup> Based on my reading, the indications in the legislative history tend to support the district court's interpretation that the term \"knowingly\" does not extend as far as knowledge that the means of identification used is that of another person. In the legislative history, there are references both to thefts of the identities of other persons and to the use of false identifications, including (as here) use of Social Security numbers. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 108-528, at 5-6, 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. 779, 780. The discussion did not distinguish between the two, nor did it focus on the mens rea issue which concerns us. The opponents of the legislation based their opposition on the mandatory nature of the sentences, and not on differing views of the mens rea requirement. <i>See</i> 150 Cong. Rec. H4811 (statement of Rep. Scott).</p>\n<p>It would be quite logical for Congress to impose additional punishment when the means of a crime involves the use of a false identity, both when the defendant knows the identification is \"of another person\" and when the defendant does not. I doubt that Congress would have intended, had it explicitly focused on the issue, to create an escape clause from the additional punishment for felons who could not be shown to have known the identification they used was that \"of another person.\" It is not a stretch to conclude, as the district court did, that the purpose of the statute encompassed the use of the Social Security number of an innocent Maine resident whether the defendant knew the Social Security number was that person's or not. <i>Godin,</i> 489 F.Supp.2d at 121.</p>\n<p>Still, the text provides support for the other view. In favor of defendant's reading is the distinction in language between the general offense in § 1028A(a)(1) and the terrorism offense in § 1028A(a)(2), which could be read as explicitly covering knowing use of both \"a means of identification of another person\" and \"a false identification document.\" Congress could easily have used the broader language of subsection (a)(2) in subsection (a)(1), but did not.</p>\n<p>In this situation, guidance may come from the Supreme Court's latest opinion applying the rule of lenity, <i>United States v. Santos,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145804\"><a href=\"/opinion/145804/united-states-v-santos/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span> (2008). The plurality opinion stated that there was \"no more reason to think\" that a key term in the statute that Congress had not defined meant one thing over another. <i>Id.</i> at 2025. That is very close to this case. Ultimately, Justice Stevens's opinion provided the necessary vote for a majority and weighed the rule of lenity in the determination of the outcome where he believed Congress had left the term undefined but he considered that Congress could not have intended a particular result. <i>Id.</i> at 2033 (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment). So too, here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> In the end, the Supreme Court may resolve this important question of interpretation of the present statute.

The predicate in 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1), however, is \"shall . . . be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years.\" <i>See</i> The Chicago Manual of Style 5.23 (15th ed.2003) (defining predicate as \"the part that contains a verb and makes an assertion about the subject\" and providing examples). Our phrase is a participial phrase because it begins with a participle and modifies the subject \"whoever.\" <i>See Id.</i> at 5.109.</p>\n<p>[8]  In <i>Jimenez,</i> we noted that another purpose of the aggravated identity theft statute is to deter the use of real identifications during the commission of a crime because real identifications provide better cover than false identifications. <i>Jimenez,</i> 507 F.3d at 20. We do not question this explanation of the purpose of the statute, but we do not find it relevant to the current discussion. Those who use real identification so that their crimes will be harder to detect generally know that the identification belongs to another person.</p>\n<p>[9]  In <i>Gens,</i> the defendants were charged with eight counts of willfully misapplying funds from a federally-insured bank. <i>Gens,</i> 493 F.2d at 217. The defendants executed a scheme in which the two defendants who controlled the bank loaned money to debtors who then gave the funds to a third defendant. <i>Id.</i> at 218-19. The district court instructed the jury that, to reach a guilty verdict, they needed only to find that the defendants knew that loan proceeds were going to a person other than the debtors. <i>Id.</i> at 221. We held that this was error because the government also had to show that the defendants knew that the debtors would not repay. <i>Id.</i> at 222. We reversed the defendants' convictions on seven of the eight counts because substantial evidence did not support a finding of willful misapplication. <i>Id.</i> at 223. On the eighth count, we vacated the conviction and remanded for a new trial because the government had presented sufficient evidence for a jury to find that the defendants knew that the debtor on one of the loans would not repay. <i>Id.</i> at 223-24.</p>\n<p>[10]  There are several other ambiguities which also may affect the mens rea requirement. One is what is meant by \"another person.\" Presumably, the statute includes past persons as well as living persons; it is also possible it was meant to include identification such as Social Security numbers held in reserve for future persons.\n</p>\n<p>In addition, the statute is not clear whether the means of identification must <i>belong</i> to another person, as the district court interpreted it, or whether the means of identification merely must be based on the identity of another person. Those issues are not before us. There is no question here that the Social Security number here belonged to the Maine resident.</p>\n\n</div>",
