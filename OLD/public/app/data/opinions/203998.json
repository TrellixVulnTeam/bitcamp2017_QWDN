Sadly, this court is once again\n\naddressing the legal aftermath of a small plane crash killing\n\nseveral people.     It has been some years since we last had to decide\n\nsuch a case.     See In re N-500L Cases, 691 F.2d 15 (1st Cir. 1982);\n\nsee also Fed. Express Corp. v. Rhode Island, 664 F.2d 830 (1st Cir.\n\n1981); Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. United States, 561 F.2d 381 (1st\n\nCir. 1977).    We affirm the entry of judgment for the United States\n\nagainst plaintiffs' claim of air traffic controller liability in a\n\nhighly fact based tort case.\n\n           On the afternoon of January 5, 2002, a small Cessna\n\nConquest airplane flown by Alexander Wojciechowicz crashed into\n\nhigh terrain in the Carribean National Forest near the El Yunque\n\nmountain   peak    in   Puerto    Rico.       Wojciechowicz    and    his    four\n\npassengers, members of his family, were killed.               Plaintiffs, who\n\ninclude Wojciechowicz's surviving relatives, his and his daughter's\n\nestates,   the    aircraft's     registered    owner,   and   the    aircraft's\n\ninsurer, sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act\n\n(\"FTCA\"), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2671, alleging the air traffic\n\ncontroller on duty in San Juan, Marcos Santiago, was negligent.\n\n           After    a   twelve-day    bench    trial,   the   district      court\n\nultimately found that Santiago could not have reasonably foreseen\n\nWojciechowicz would take the actions he did, which were in direct\n\nviolation of a pilot's duties, that Santiago's actions or inactions\n\nwere not a proximate cause of the crash, and that Wojciechowicz's\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fown negligence was the sole cause of the crash.             The court also\n\nfound that the controller had not violated any duty of care; but\n\neven if the controller did violate a duty, the court found that any\n\nviolation did not cause the crash.              The judge apportioned no\n\nliability to the government.       Wojciechowicz v. United States, 576\n\nF. Supp. 2d 241, 278 (D.P.R. 2008).\n\n           On appeal, plaintiffs claim the district court primarily\n\nerred in finding there was no duty of care stemming from a Federal\n\nAviation Administration (\"FAA\") operations manual and FAA training\n\ninstructions.      They say this error infected the later findings,\n\nwhich, they say, are clearly erroneous anyway.         First, they argue,\n\nthe court erroneously held that ¶ 5-5-9 of the FAA Air Traffic\n\nControl   Manual    (\"ATCM\"),    FAA    Order   7110.65M,   which   requires\n\ncontrollers to maintain separation of aircraft from prominent\n\nobstructions depicted on the radar screen by specified minimum\n\ndistances, did not apply to Wojciechowicz's flight, which was under\n\nVisual Flight Rules (\"VFR\") (as opposed to Instrument Flight Rules\n\n(\"IFR\")), and that Santiago owed no duty to warn Wojciechowicz to\n\nchange course.     Second, they argue the court erred in holding that\n\nthe air traffic control authority, the San Juan Combined Enroute\n\nand Radar Approach Control Facility (\"CERAP\"), was authorized to\n\ndepart from the FAA's curriculum in training Santiago and that it\n\ntrained him adequately.         See FAA Air Traffic Technical Training\n\nManual, FAA Order 3120.4J.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f              The record supports the district court's findings that\n\nplaintiffs     nonetheless       failed    to   meet       their   burden     to   show\n\nnegligence or causation.           We reject plaintiffs' arguments that\n\nthese findings were clearly erroneous and affirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n              We outline the facts. Greater detail may be found in the\n\ndistrict court's opinion.          Wojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 246-\n\n51.\n\n              Wojciechowicz owned a vacation home on Culebra Island and\n\nwas an experienced pilot with nearly four thousand hours of flight\n\nexperience.     He had flown the route between Culebra Island and the\n\nSan Juan airport over two hundred times and was familiar both with\n\nthe approach to the airport and with El Yunque and the surrounding\n\nterrain.      He was rated for flight under both IFR and VFR.\n\n              At approximately 2:00 p.m. that day, Wojciechowicz took\n\noff from Culebra Island, which is eighteen nautical miles east of\n\nthe    east   coast     of    Puerto   Rico,    for    a    flight      to   San   Juan\n\nInternational Airport.           The trip can be completed in twenty to\n\nthirty minutes.\n\n              Wojciechowicz chose to fly under VFR.                  His choice had\n\nseveral consequences.           Under VFR procedures, set forth in FAA\n\nregulations and the FAA-published Aeronautical Information Manual\n\n(\"AIM\"), a pilot navigates by observing the surroundings rather\n\nthan    by    relying    on    instruments.           As    a   pilot    under     VFR,\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fWojciechowicz was forbidden by FAA regulations from flying into\n\nclouds or into areas of reduced visibility unless he asked the\n\ncontroller for permission to do so.      See 14 C.F.R. § 91.155; In re\n\nN-500L Cases, 691 F.2d at 28-29; Cappello v. Duncan Aircraft Sales\n\nof Fla., Inc., 79 F.3d 1465, 1467, 1469 (6th Cir. 1996).          Although\n\nhe never asked for permission, the pilot did exactly that.\n\n           By contrast, pilots under IFR must file a special flight\n\nplan, must navigate by use of their instruments, and may not fly\n\nbelow Minimum Vectoring Altitude (\"MVA\"), which is generally set at\n\ntwo thousand feet above the elevation of the terrain.           VFR pilots\n\nare not so restricted and may fly below both the MVA and the\n\nelevation of nearby terrain.     See Biles v. United States, 848 F.2d\n\n661, 663 (5th Cir. 1988).     In sparsely populated areas, such as the\n\narea in which the crash occurred, there is no restriction on how\n\nlow a VFR pilot may fly except that the pilot must maintain a\n\nminimum distance of five hundred feet laterally from any structure,\n\nvehicle, or person. 14 C.F.R. § 91.119(c). Wojciechowicz operated\n\nunder VFR procedures throughout the flight.\n\n           Wojciechowicz contacted CERAP by radio in San Juan at\n\n2:18 p.m., about eighteen minutes after he left Culebra, to request\n\nlanding at Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport in San Juan.           He\n\nwas then ten miles east of Fajardo, Puerto Rico, and traveling at\n\n190 knots, or about three miles per minute.          At 2:18:30 p.m.,\n\nSantiago   requested   that   Wojciechowicz   \"squawk\"   0477    into   his\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\faircraft's transponder to allow Santiago's radar scope to better\n\nidentify      the   aircraft.1    Wojciechowicz       complied.     Santiago\n\nresponded to Wojciechowicz's landing request at 2:19:54 p.m.,\n\nproviding him with an approach vector to the airport from the\n\ntraffic pattern south of Plaza Carolina and weather information for\n\nSan Juan.      Santiago asked Wojciechowicz to state his altitude.\n\nWojciechowicz replied that he was at 1600 feet above sea level and\n\nstated   he    would   stay   south   at    Plaza   Carolina.     During   his\n\ncommunications with Santiago, Wojciechowicz gave no indication that\n\nhe was in any distress, that he was unaware of his altitude or\n\nlocation, that he could not maintain his own separation from\n\nterrain, or that he was in need of navigation assistance.\n\n              This was the first and only conversation between the\n\ncontroller Santiago and the pilot and it took place between 2:18\n\nand 2:20:37.\n\n              At that point, the plane was in clear air and had at\n\nleast ten miles of visibility.        That meant the pilot could clearly\n\nsee the rising terrain to El Yunque ahead and the north coast of\n\nPuerto Rico, where the airport was, to his right.           The pilot could\n\nalso see there was a cloud base intersecting the rising terrain\n\nahead.\n\n\n\n     1\n          A controller gives a pilot a \"squawk,\" or a radar\nidentification code, for the pilot to input into the plane's\ntransponder that identifies the flight on the radar scope. See\nCappello, 79 F.3d at 1468 n.1.\n\n                                      -7-\n\f                  After the conversation ended, the plane continued on\n\nSantiago's radar for nearly one more minute but disappeared from\n\nthe radar scope shortly before the accident.                    In the time the\n\naircraft remained on the radar, Wojciechowicz made no further\n\nattempts to contact Santiago by radio.            The last radar data for the\n\nplane was received at 2:21:18.            After radar contact was lost, the\n\nplane's data on the airport radar scope entered \"coast\" mode, in\n\nwhich the computer indicates radar contact is lost and predicts the\n\naircraft's         position.2    The    last   coast   data   was   displayed    at\n\n2:21:42.          Within forty-three seconds, Santiago was on the radio\n\ntrying to get a response, without success, from the pilot.                      The\n\nendpoint, the crash, occurred at approximately 2:23 p.m. at a point\n\n1.43 miles northeast of the El Yunque peak and at an elevation of\n\n1561 feet (El Yunque itself is 3637 feet tall).\n\n                  We return to what Santiago knew from the radar.         At the\n\npoint       the    plane   disappeared    from   the   radar,    the   plane    was\n\napproximately 4.7 miles from the peak of El Yunque.                 Wojciechowicz\n\nat that point had ample visibility (of approximately three nautical\n\nmiles) to allow him to see the clouds he was approaching ahead and\n\nan area of clear weather and lower terrain to the north to which he\n\ncould       safely    turn.     The    government's    expert    testified     that\n\n\n        2\n          Plaintiffs say that Santiago also had available to him a\n\"vector link,\" a feature that, when activated by the controller,\ndisplayed the computer's prediction of where the aircraft would fly\nminutes into the future. This information is immaterial to the\ndistrict court's findings.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fWojciechowicz could easily have avoided the crash by changing\n\ncourse.   He testified that Wojciechowicz would have needed only\n\nseventeen to eighteen seconds to maneuver away from the accident\n\nsite.\n\n           The district court made findings about what information\n\nwas   available   to   Santiago   when   there   was   radar   contact.\n\nSantiago's radar scope showed Wojciechowicz's altitude above sea\n\nlevel and displayed MVA data for the surrounding area, but it did\n\nnot display terrain features, the elevation of the terrain, or the\n\naircraft's altitude above the ground.            The scope did display\n\nprominent obstructions, including El Yunque peak, which had a\n\ncommunications tower located on it.      It did not, however, display\n\nthe elevation of the tower or of El Yunque.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           Plaintiffs brought three lawsuits, seeking recovery for\n\nthe wrongful deaths of Wojciechowicz and one of his passengers,\n\ncontribution for money the insurers had paid to settle a state\n\ncourt suit brought by relatives of two other passengers, and\n\ncontribution for funds paid by the insurer for the destruction of\n\nthe aircraft. On December 10, 2004, the district court granted the\n\ngovernment's motion to consolidate the cases.\n\n           Plaintiffs conceded that Wojciechowicz had been negligent\n\nbut argued the government was partially at fault for the crash.\n\nThey claimed Santiago had negligently failed to separate the flight\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\ffrom El Yunque peak by at least three miles, which they claim is\n\nrequired by ¶ 5-5-9 of the ATCM.3 They also claimed CERAP had\n\nfailed to train and test Santiago on significant terrain areas and\n\nobstructions as required by a curriculum contained in the FAA's Air\n\nTraffic Technical Training Order, FAA Order 3120.4J.4   They argued\n\nthat had Santiago been more familiar with the terrain, he would\n\nhave issued a safety alert to Wojciechowicz, and this alert would\n\nhave resulted in avoidance of the crash.\n\n          Paragraph 5-5-9 of the ATCM, titled \"Separation from\n\nObstructions,\" sits within Chapter 5 of the manual, titled \"Radar,\"\n\nand Section 5 of that chapter, titled \"Radar Separation.\"       It\n\nstates in relevant part:\n\n          [S]eparate     aircraft     from     prominent\n          obstructions depicted on the radar scope . . .\n          by the following minima:\n          1. When less than 40 miles from the antenna -\n          3 miles.\n          2. When 40 miles or more from the antenna - 5\n          miles.5\n\n\n\n     3\n          The United States argued that Santiago had no duty under\n¶ 5-5-9 to separate Wojciechowicz's flight from El Yunque because\n¶ 5-5-9 applies only for IFR flights and that even if Santiago had\na duty to separate Wojciechowicz's flight, he did not breach his\nduty.\n     4\n          The government argued that local air traffic control\nauthorities had the authority to modify Order 3120.4J's curriculum\nand that Santiago had received adequate training.\n     5\n          The provision refers to two exceptions.      It does not\napply in \"En Route Stage A/DARC or Stage A/EDARC.\"        There is\nnothing in the record about these exceptions, but the parties agree\nthey do not apply to this case.\n\n                               -10-\n\fATCM ¶ 5-5-9 (emphasis in original). Here, the required separation\n\nwas three miles.\n\n            While plaintiffs' case rests largely on ATCM ¶ 5-5-9 and\n\nthe   training   order,      also    pertinent   to   the    case    are    the   FAA\n\nregulations, other provisions of the ATCM, and provisions of other\n\nFAA manuals.      The FAA has promulgated regulations that govern\n\npilots' operations.         See 14 C.F.R. pt. 91.     These regulations have\n\nthe force and effect of law, but here the plaintiffs do not claim\n\na   violation    of   the    C.F.R.      In    addition,     the    FAA    publishes\n\noperations manuals, including the ATCM for controllers and the AIM\n\nfor pilots.\n\n            The controlling law of this circuit is that the ATCM is\n\nnot a statute or a regulation but an internal FAA guideline issued\n\nto FAA controllers, which governs their conduct.                   As such, under\n\nour   case law the ATCM is merely an indication of the standard of\n\ncare.     Fed. Express Corp., 664 F.2d at 835.                Further, we treat\n\n\"substantial\"     failures      to    adhere   to   the     ATCM    guidelines     as\n\n\"persuasive as an indication of a lack of due care.\"                 Id. (quoting\n\nDelta Air Lines, Inc., 561 F.2d at 390).6\n\n            Independently of ¶ 5-5-9's separation requirement, ATCM\n\n¶ 2-1-6 requires a controller to issue a safety alert to the pilot\n\n\n\n      6\n          In arguing that the ATCM carries the force of law, the\ndissent mischaracterizes the law in this circuit. This panel is\nbound by circuit precedent, which only an en banc court can change.\nUnited States v. Lizardo, 445 F.3d 73, 88 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                       -11-\n\fif the controller is \"aware the aircraft is in a position/altitude\n\nwhich,   in       [the    controller's]       judgment,       places    it   in   unsafe\n\nproximity to terrain, obstructions, or other aircraft.\"\n\n              The AIM, by contrast, is an FAA publication that explains\n\nto   pilots       the     application    of    FAA        regulations   in   different\n\ncircumstances.           Like the ATCM, the AIM is merely indicative of the\n\nstandard of care.           Id.; Delta Air Lines, Inc., 561 F.2d at 390.\n\nSeveral of its provisions also discuss the conduct of air traffic\n\ncontrollers.        Paragraph 5-5-8 of the AIM states that a pilot \"is\n\nresponsible to see and avoid other traffic, terrain, or obstacles.\"\n\nThat provision also says that a controller will issue a safety\n\nalert \"if aware the aircraft is at an altitude believed to place\n\nthe aircraft in unsafe proximity to terrain, obstructions, or other\n\naircraft.\"\n\n              A    separate      provision,      ¶    3-2-6(f),     states    that   \"no\n\nseparation services are provided to VFR aircraft\" in Class E\n\nairspace,     the        class   of   airspace       in    which   Wojciechowicz     was\n\noperating at all pertinent times.                    In addition, AIM § 4-1-17(e)\n\nprovides that VFR pilots are not relieved of their responsibilities\n\nto \"maintain appropriate terrain and obstruction clearance, or to\n\nremain in [VFR-appropriate] weather conditions\" by the fact that\n\nthey are receiving basic radar services from a terminal.\n\n              Finally, FAA Order 3120.4J is an FAA operating manual\n\naddressed to air traffic control authorities.                       It sets forth a\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fnational curriculum for training controllers.     Two provisions of\n\nOrder 3120.4J set forth training exercises under which a trainee is\n\nrequired to label or draw topographical features on an unlabeled\n\nchart of the local area and to identify significant terrain areas\n\nand obstructions on an unlabeled video map.7\n\n          The district court entered judgment in favor of the\n\nUnited States.   It held that ATCM ¶ 5-5-9 did not apply to VFR\n\nflights but only to IFR flights.        It further found that, even\n\nassuming ATCM ¶ 5-5-9 did apply to VFR flights, Santiago did not\n\nviolate the provision because the last radar information he had for\n\nthe flight came well before it entered the three-mile radius around\n\nEl Yunque.   Wojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 269.   Crediting the\n\ntestimony of the government's expert witness, Edward Henderson,\n\nthat ¶ 5-5-9 requires a \"radar separation,\" the court held that\n\n\"[w]ithout the aircraft remaining in radar contact it would have\n\nbeen impossible for Mr. Santiago to apply the aforementioned radar\n\nseparation criteria to N441AW.    Thus, the provisions of [¶] 5-5-9\n\ncould not have been implemented because the aircraft was not\n\nvisible on Mr. Santiago's radar scope.\"     Id.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n          Plaintiffs cite Courses 55060 and 55065.

It found the data available to\n\nSantiago did not provide him with information about the plane's\n\nproximity to terrain, and, because Wojciechowicz was operating as\n\na VFR pilot, Santiago did not know his intentions as to his route.\n\nSantiago was therefore not aware that Wojciechowicz was in a\n\nposition which, in Santiago's judgment, placed him in unsafe\n\nproximity to terrain.      Id. at 258-60.\n\n          As to the second issue, the court held that CERAP had\n\nleeway to adapt Order 3120.4J's curriculum to local requirements\n\nand that it had adequately trained Santiago on terrain features by\n\ninstructing him on local MVA information.              Further, the court\n\nfound, any deficiency in training did not cause plaintiffs' harm.\n\nThe general terrain knowledge the training would have provided\n\nwould not have given Santiago sufficient information regarding the\n\nflight's unsafe proximity to terrain to require the issuance of a\n\nsafety alert.   Id. at 259-60, 262.\n\n          The   district    court    also    found    that   \"even   assuming\n\narguendo that a duty had been owed and breached by the controller\n\n. . ., plaintiffs ha[d] failed to prove that any such breach was\n\nthe cause of the crash . . . or that the pilot's actions in this\n\ncase were foreseeable.\"        Id. at 277.           The court found that\n\nWojciechowicz's actions had been negligent and that his negligence\n\nwas the sole cause of the accident.

This may show that the FAA would have specified that ¶ 5-5-9\napplies only to IFR flights if that were the agency's intention.\nHowever, it may be reasonable to think, given the regulatory\nframework applicable to VFR pilots, that ¶ 5-5-9 does not apply to\nVFR flights because the pilot of the VFR aircraft is assumed to be\nable to see obstructions and to avoid them.\n       9\n          We also do not address the issue of whether plaintiffs'\nclaim is ever cognizable under the FTCA, given AIM ¶ 3-2-6(f)'s\nexpress disclaimer that separation services are not provided to VFR\naircraft in Class E airspace.

See In re N-500L Cases, 691 F.2d at\n\n27.   It is undisputed that Puerto Rico law applies here; for these\n\npurposes, Puerto Rico is treated as a state.     Negligence law in\n\nPuerto Rico is governed by the Civil Code, which imposes liability\n\nfor an \"act or omission\" that causes damages to another through\n\nfault or negligence.\"     P.R.

A plaintiff must prove injury, \"a negligent or\n\nintentional act or omission (the breach of duty element),\" and \"a\n\nsufficient causal nexus between the injury and the defendant's\n\nactions or omissions.\"     Vázquez-Filippetti v.

Vázquez-Filippetti, 504 F.3d at 49. To establish\n\nproximate cause, a plaintiff must prove that the accident was\n\n\"foreseeable and could have been avoided if the defendant had not\n\nbreached its duty of care.\" Grajales-Romero v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,\n\n194 F.3d 288, 296 (1st Cir. 1999).         Proximate cause is not proven\n\nif the defendant can show the occurrence of an intervening cause\n\nthat was not foreseeable. Id.; see also Marshall v. Perez Arzuaga,\n\n828 F.2d 845, 847 (1st Cir. 1987) (noting that the causation\n\nrequirement in Puerto Rico law \"limits a party's liability for\n\nhazards flowing from its negligence to those hazards that could be\n\n'anticipated by a prudent person'\" (quoting Pacheco v. P.R. Water\n\nRes. Auth., 112 P.R. Offic. Trans. 369, 372 (1982))).\n\n          A separate issue is the duties of care owed respectively\n\nby controllers and pilots. The violation of FAA regulations, which\n\nhave the force and effect of law, is negligence per se.         See In re\n\nN-500L Cases, 691 F.2d at 28.   The plaintiffs' case is not based on\n\na violation of regulations.     Rather, it is based on FAA manuals,\n\nsuch as the AIM and the ATCM, which do not have the force of law\n\nbut only provide evidence of the standard of care among pilots and\n\ncontrollers.   Id.   Still, \"a substantial and unjustified failure\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fto follow procedures made mandatory by the manual is persuasive as\n\nan indication of a lack of due care.\"        Fed. Express Corp., 664 F.2d\n\nat 835 (quoting Delta Air Lines, Inc., 561 F.2d at 390) (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n           Pilots   are   assumed    to    have   read   the   AIM   and   FAA\n\ninformational circulars and to know their provisions. In re N-500L\n\nCases, 691 F.2d at 28.      A controller is ordinarily entitled to\n\nassume, absent an objective manifestation of evidence to the\n\ncontrary, that a pilot is complying with his own responsibilities\n\nunder FAA regulations and those manuals and circulars.                 In re\n\nN-500L Cases, 691 F.2d at 31; Fed. Express Corp., 664 F.2d at\n\n836-37.   This has been our rule for some time and a number of other\n\ncircuits have adopted the same rule. See, e.g., Thurston v. United\n\nStates, No. 95-411, 1996 WL 579929, at *3 (10th Cir. Oct. 9, 1996)\n\n(mem.); Cappello, 79 F.3d at 1468; Biles, 848 F.2d at 663; Redhead\n\nv. United States, 686 F.2d 178, 183 (3d Cir. 1982).\n\n           It is also clear, to be sure, that if the controller were\n\nnegligent and if this were a proximate cause for the accident,\n\nliability could be apportioned to the controller. See Rodriquez v.\n\nUnited States, 823 F.2d 735, 745-46 (3d Cir. 1987).            But liability\n\nmay be imposed only if it is foreseeable that the controller's\n\nnegligent conduct will cause injury.         A plaintiff who establishes\n\nthe government breached its duties must show that the negligent\n\nconduct is a legal cause of the harm.

The actions of the controller must be judged against\n\nwhat a reasonable person, under the same or similar circumstances,\n\nwould have done.   See W.P. Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the\n\nLaw of Torts § 37, at 236-37 (5th ed. 1984).10\n\nA.        Plaintiffs' Claims under ATCM    ¶ 5-5-9 (Controllers'\n          Duties as to Separation from Obstructions)\n\n          The government argues that the standard of care under\n\n¶ 5-5-9 of the ATCM, assuming it applies to VFR flights at all,\n\nturns on what a reasonable controller in Santiago's situation would\n\nhave done given the information he had available to him, the fact\n\nthat Wojciechowicz was operating as a VFR pilot, and the fact that\n\nat a point before the buffer zone the plane was no longer on the\n\ncontroller's radar screen.\n\n          Plaintiffs' core argument is that Santiago was in breach\n\nof the ATCM ¶ 5-5-9 and that this was negligence per se, so they\n\nneed not prove causation.    As required by our precedent, we reject\n\nthe argument that the ATCM has the same effect as a regulation and\n\nthat any violation would be negligence per se. Fed. Express Corp.,\n\n664 F.2d at 835.\n\n          Plaintiffs also argue that they have established both a\n\nviolation of ¶ 5-5-9 and causation.     They say that although the\n\n\n     10\n          Plaintiffs often ignore this principle by proceeding\nbackwards from the information now known and arguing about whether\nSantiago's actions were reasonable given this knowledge.       The\nappropriate inquiry focuses on what was known to the controller at\nthe time. Kelley v. Schlumberger Tech. Corp., 849 F.2d 41, 45 (1st\nCir. 1988).\n\n                                -19-\n\flast radar data Santiago received showed the flight was 4.7 miles\n\nfrom El Yunque peak, outside of the three-mile buffer, (a) ¶ 5-5-9\n\nnonetheless required Santiago to issue a warning to Wojciechowicz\n\nat some point before he entered the buffer, and (b) this warning\n\nwas necessary to allow the pilot adequate time to change course.\n\nThe latter proposition is simply untrue on the record.            We turn to\n\nthe first contention.\n\n           Plaintiffs' theory is that even though Santiago could not\n\nhave foreseen Wojciechowicz's actions, that is immaterial because\n\nSantiago was under a legal duty to keep a separation of three miles\n\nbetween the plane and the El Yunque tower marked on his radar and\n\nbecause   the   controller   breached    this   duty   by   not   issuing   a\n\nseparation order well before the plane neared the buffer zone.              If\n\nSantiago had done so, they argue, Wojciechowicz would have been\n\nalerted to the danger and would have changed course.\n\n           This argument goes to when separation must be maintained.\n\nIt suffers from the obvious problem that there was no violation of\n\nthe plain text of ¶ 5-5-9, which states only the three-mile\n\nseparation minimum.    The provision contains no mandatory language\n\nstating when a controller must take action to attempt to maintain\n\na separation.    Given the lack of mandatory language in ¶ 5-5-9 on\n\nthe issue of when to maintain the separation, the district court\n\ncorrectly understood the question posed by plaintiffs as one of\n\n\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fwhat a reasonable controller would have done on these particular\n\nfacts.11\n\n                Further, plaintiffs have not articulated any clear theory\n\non when separation must be initiated.          James Parham,   plaintiffs'\n\nexpert     on    air   traffic   control   procedures,   testified   that   a\n\nreasonable and prudent controller would have given a separation\n\norder when Wojciechowicz was seven miles away from El Yunque and\n\nfour miles from the three-mile buffer zone to give the pilot time\n\nto comply and to avoid the obstruction.          However, this was merely\n\nParham's opinion; Parham did not testify about actual practice\n\nunder ¶ 5-5-9.\n\n                Under our case law, actual practice under a regulation or\n\nordinance is important to determining its meaning and may become\n\nanother source of a legal obligation. See, e.g., Pelletier v. Main\n\nSt. Textiles, LP, 470 F.3d 48, 55-56 (1st Cir. 2006); South Shore\n\nHosp., Inc. v. Thompson, 308 F.3d 91, 102-03 (1st Cir. 2002); Delta\n\nAir Lines, Inc., 561 F.2d at 389-90 & n.5.          No evidence of actual\n\npractice from the plaintiffs as to the interpretation of ATCM ¶ 5-\n\n5-9 was admitted.        The court was not required to accept Parham's\n\n\n\n\n     11\n          The dissent, contrary to our law, characterizes this\nquestion as one of law for a judge to decide and not a question of\nfact. The reasonableness of a controller's action is in this case\na question of fact. Thus we have held that \"[i]n deciding what a\nreasonable person could do, a jury's latitude is considerable.\"\nRodríguez-Quiñones, 402 F.3d at 256.\n\n                                      -21-\n\fview, which was inherently inconsistent with the testimony of the\n\ngovernment's expert.\n\n          The district court found that a reasonable controller,\n\ngiven the facts of this case, would not have separated the flight\n\nat (or before) 4.7 miles.12 That was because it was more reasonable\n\nfor the controller at that point to rely on the VFR pilot, who, the\n\ncontroller could assume, was complying with his duties to see and\n\navoid terrain and obstacles and to maintain VFR-minimum visibility.\n\nThe pilot then had clear visibility.     Wojciechowicz had given no\n\nindication that he was in distress or unable to comply with his\n\nobligations, and he would have had ample time to change course at\n\nfour miles out.13\n\n          The court's finding was not clear error.    Wojciechowicz\n\nwas under a legal duty to know the route and to have consulted maps\n\nof the area.    See Cappello, 79 F.3d at 1468.   There is no serious\n\ncontention that the pilot did not know where El Yunque was.      In\n\ncontrast, Santiago did not then know the plane's course or altitude\n\nor whether it was approaching or turning away from the obstruction,\n\nEl Yunque.     And of course, the plane disappeared from Santiago's\n\n\n     12\n          The dissent advances a new theory that the controller had\na duty to separate within thirty seconds after the last coast data\ndisappeared from his radar scope; however, this was not argued by\nany party to the case.\n     13\n          Contrary to the dissent, this case does not turn on any\nrule that mere loss of radar contact, regardless of the surrounding\ncircumstances, would vitiate a legal duty which had already arisen\nunder ¶ 5-5-9.\n\n                                -22-\n\fradar and Santiago's attempts to reestablish contact with it were\n\nunsuccessful.\n\n          Moreover, the government proffered a separate defense\n\nthat ¶ 5-5-9 could not apply under these circumstances. First, the\n\ncourt accepted the testimony from the government expert, Edward\n\nHenderson, elicited on cross-examination by plaintiffs' counsel,\n\nthat even assuming ¶ 5-5-9 applied to VFR flights, there was no\n\nviolation of ¶ 5-5-9 here because, flying under VFR, the pilot\n\ncould have changed direction or altitude at any time and the\n\ncontroller would therefore not have known whether the aircraft came\n\nwithin three miles of El Yunque.    He further testified that ¶ 5-5-9\n\nrequires \"a radar separation. And [Santiago did not] have radar on\n\nthe aircraft\" after the plane disappeared from the radar screen.\n\nThis testimony, against the background facts, is consistent with\n\nand sufficient to support the district court's conclusion that\n\nthere was no breach of any standard of care under ¶ 5-5-9, even\n\nassuming it applied to VFR flights, and further, beyond duty, that\n\nthere was no causal connection.14\n\n          Plaintiffs have also failed to show clear error in the\n\ncourt's finding that, even if Santiago had owed and breached a duty\n\nunder ¶ 5-5-9, there was no causal connection between any breach by\n\n\n     14\n          There was also no evidence presented that Santiago could\nhave reached the plane by radio contact if he had tried to do so\ninstantaneously with losing radar contact or at any point before\nthe crash, or that the pilot was then in control of the plane.\nPlaintiffs bear the burden of proof.\n\n                               -23-\n\fSantiago   and   the   accident,   or   the   court's   findings   that   the\n\naccident was not foreseeable to Santiago.\n\n           Wojciechowicz was already required by FAA regulations to\n\nchange course and avoid flying into the clouds.              Those clouds\n\nintersected with the terrain near the crash site and obscured\n\nvisibility.      See 14 C.F.R. § 91.155; Cappello, 79 F.3d at 1469.\n\nThe district court concluded that \"[h]ad Mr. Wojciechowicz not\n\nentered the clouds he would have had ample time to see and avoid\n\nthe terrain with which he ultimately collided.\" Wojciechowicz, 576\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 255.     The court supportably found the cause of the\n\ncrash was not that the flight came closer than three miles to the\n\nradar tower on El Yunque or that it was flying in high terrain, but\n\nthat the pilot flew into a cloud in violation of FAA regulations.\n\n           Further, as the district court found, Santiago could not\n\nhave reasonably foreseen that Wojciechowicz would take the actions\n\nthat the district court found led to the accident, specifically\n\n\"fly[ing] into a cloud while traversing rugged, rising terrain at\n\nlow altitude and high speed.\"       Wojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n277.   A VFR pilot can change course and altitude at any time and\n\nwithout need to obtain permission from the controller.             See In re\n\nN-500L Cases, 691 F.2d at 31; Cappello, 79 F.3d at 1469.            Santiago\n\nhad no reason other than speculation to think that the flight was\n\nheading directly into a cloud.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fB.        ATCM ¶ 2-1-6 (Safety Alert)\n\n          Plaintiffs argue that Santiago was also in breach of his\n\nduty under ATCM ¶ 2-1-6 to issue a safety alert to Wojciechowicz\n\nbecause of his unsafe proximity to the terrain.          Whether this\n\nprovision is evidence giving rise to a duty in the controller to\n\nissue a safety alert turns on the information available to the\n\ncontroller. The duty arises when the controller is \"aware that the\n\naircraft is in a position or altitude which, in the controller's\n\njudgment, places the aircraft in unsafe proximity to terrain or\n\nobstructions.\"15    Wojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 258 (emphasis\n\nin original).      Here, the district court supportably found these\n\nprovisions   did    not   apply   to   Santiago.   Santiago   only   had\n\ninformation on the flight's altitude above sea level; he had no\n\ninformation about the elevation of the surrounding terrain, the\n\naircraft's altitude over the ground, or its proximity to any\n\nterrain or obstacles (aside from its distance from the tower on El\n\nYunque). When the flight disappeared from Santiago's radar shortly\n\nbefore the crash, he had even less information about the flight.\n\nNor was there any indication from Wojciechowicz before then that he\n\nwas in distress.\n\n\n\n\n     15\n          We recognize but do not resolve the issue of whether this\ndiscretionary language triggers the discretionary function\nexception to the FTCA. See Fothergill v. United States, 566 F.3d\n248, 252 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n                                   -25-\n\f           Plaintiffs argue that Santiago should have known the\n\naircraft was in unsafe proximity to terrain because it was flying\n\ntoward El Yunque peak at an altitude below the peak's elevation.\n\nThe   district   court   made   a   finding   rejecting   this   argument.\n\nWojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 260.        There is no clear error in\n\nthe district court's conclusion that the information available to\n\nSantiago, who knew Wojciechowicz was operating under VFR procedures\n\nand who received no distress calls from the pilot, was insufficient\n\nto alert Santiago to the fact that Wojciechowicz had placed himself\n\nin a dangerous position.    See id. at 259-60.     A VFR pilot flying in\n\na sparsely populated area may fly close to the ground and below the\n\naltitude of surrounding terrain, so long as minimum visibility is\n\nmaintained. 14 C.F.R. §§ 91.119(c), 91.155(a); see Biles, 848 F.2d\n\nat 663.\n\nC.         Plaintiffs' Claim under Courses 55060 and 55065 of the\n           Air Traffic Technical Training Order\n\n           Plaintiffs' arguments related to alleged deficiencies in\n\nSantiago's training fail for similar reasons.16       Essentially, they\n\nargue that certain FAA training guidelines have the force of law\n\nand that CERAP's failure to follow the training led to Santiago\n\nbeing unfamiliar with the terrain and obstructions in his area of\n\nresponsibility and that because of his unfamiliarity, he did not\n\n\n\n      16\n          We do not reach plaintiffs' argument that the district\ncourt erred in holding that CERAP had leeway to depart from the\nFAA's national training directives.\n\n                                    -26-\n\frecognize the danger of Wojciechowicz's situation. They argue this\n\nled Santiago to fail to issue a safety alert as required under ATCM\n\n¶ 2-1-6.17\n\n             The district court accepted Santiago's testimony that he\n\nwas familiar with the location of El Yunque and the mountains but\n\nnot with every peak and valley.        The court also found that even if\n\nSantiago     had   been   aware   of   the   high   terrain     over    which\n\nWojciechowicz was flying, he would not have been aware that the\n\naircraft was in unsafe proximity to the terrain because of the lack\n\nof terrain information on his radar scope, the fact that he only\n\nknew the aircraft's elevation above sea level rather than its\n\nelevation above the ground, and the fact that he had no reason not\n\nto   presume   that   Wojciechowicz    was   complying   with   VFR    flight\n\nprocedures.     Wojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 259-60.         The court\n\nalso found that general terrain knowledge would not have led\n\nSantiago to be aware that the flight was in unsafe proximity to\n\nterrain and that a safety alert was therefore required.                Id. at\n\n262.\n\n\n\n\n       17\n           Plaintiffs' argument that ¶ 2-1-6 required Santiago to\nissue a safety alert is distinct from an argument they made to the\ndistrict court that Santiago was under a duty to issue a safety\nadvisory because of the presence of high terrain in the area. See\nWojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 266-67.       Plaintiffs give no\ncitation to support the notion that there is a free-standing\nobligation to issue a safety advisory. The district court rejected\nthe latter argument and plaintiffs have not challenged this holding\non appeal.\n\n                                   -27-\n\f           The bottom line is that there was no clear error in the\n\ncourt's finding that the purported lack of training plaintiffs rely\n\non did not cause Santiago's inaction.            In the end, the district\n\ncourt   found   that   there   was   no     foreseeability   and   no   causal\n\nrelationship between any breach by Santiago and the plaintiffs'\n\ninjury.   These may be mixed questions of fact and law, but they are\n\ncomponents of negligence, so our review is for clear error.               See\n\nFed. Express Corp., 664 F.2d at 835.             There was no clear error\n\nhere.\n\n           Plaintiffs' only argument that the court clearly erred\n\nis, again, that because the aircraft was flying toward El Yunque at\n\nan altitude lower than the elevation of the peak, Santiago should\n\nhave known the aircraft was in unsafe proximity to the terrain.\n\nFor the reasons stated earlier, this argument fails.\n\nD.         Conclusion\n\n           Given the evidence and our standard of review in this\n\nfact based case, we find no reversible error.\n\n           The district court's judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                   -Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\f               LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting.            There is no question\n\nthat the pilot bears primary responsibility for the tragic accident\n\nat issue here.       Nevertheless, that is only part of the story.           This\n\ncase raises important questions about the scope of an air traffic\n\ncontroller's duty of care to a plane flown under visual flight\n\nrules (\"VFR\") after radar contact initiated by the pilot is then\n\nlost.    The majority accepts the district court's finding that any\n\npossible breach of duty by the controller did not contribute to the\n\ncrash.     I do not agree.            If a controller's duty to separate\n\naircraft from terrain continues after radar contact is lost, we\n\ncould not conclude that the controller's conduct had no effect on\n\nthe accident.           I believe that Santiago did have such a duty and\n\nthat,     on     this     record,    he   was    required    to   attempt   radio\n\ncommunication with the airplane in time to separate it from El\n\nYunque.        Because the record shows that, if Santiago had done so,\n\nthe plane crash might have been prevented, I cannot conclude that\n\nSantiago's breach of duty did not contribute to the accident.                   I\n\ntherefore respectfully dissent.\n\n                                           I.\n\n               Paragraph     5-5-9   of    the   Air   Traffic    Control   Manual\n\n(\"ATCM\") requires air traffic controllers to “separate aircraft\n\nfrom prominent obstructions depicted on the radar scope,” and\n\nspecifies a minimum separation distance of three miles for aircraft\n\n\n\n\n                                          -29-\n\flike the one flown by Wojciechowicz.18 The district court held that\n\nthis provision applies only to flights operating under instrument\n\nflight rules (\"IFR\") and further concluded that, even if VFR\n\nflights were within the scope of ¶ 5-5-9, Santiago did not violate\n\nthe provision because Wojciechowicz's plane was off radar by the\n\ntime the three-mile limit was reached.          The majority assumes for\n\nthe sake of efficient analysis that ¶ 5-5-9 applies to VFR flights,\n\nand it holds that the district court did not commit clear error in\n\nfinding no breach of duty because, even though radar contact with\n\nWojciechowicz's plane was lost, the controller could reasonably\n\nrely on the pilot to see and avoid terrain and obstacles.\n\n           I do not understand how the majority can reach that\n\nconclusion.     If ¶ 5-5-9 applies to VFR flights, it can only be\n\nconstrued to impose a legal obligation on controllers to take all\n\nreasonable steps to separate aircraft from obstructions without\n\nregard to the VFR pilot's separate duty to prevent accidents.             As\n\nplaintiffs argue, the very point of applying ¶ 5-5-9 to VFR\n\naircraft   is   to   provide   a   second   layer   of   protection   against\n\naccidents like the one that occurred in this case.          It is precisely\n\n\n\n     18\n        Paragraph 5-5-9, which is titled                  \"Separation   from\nObstructions,\" states in relevant part:\n\n     [S]eparate aircraft from prominent obstructions depicted\n     on the radar scope . . . by the following minima:\n     1. When less than 40 miles from the antenna – 3 miles.\n\nATCM ¶ 5-5-9.\n\n                                     -30-\n\fin cases of unforeseeable pilot negligence that ¶ 5-5-9 would play\n\nits most critical role for VFR flights.        It thus makes no sense to\n\nsay that the provision imposes a duty whose outer limit is reached\n\nwhen the controller reasonably could rely on the pilot's own duty\n\nof care.    Such a conclusion defines the concurrent duty of the\n\ncontroller out of existence.\n\n            To resolve this case, therefore, we cannot avoid directly\n\naddressing two legal questions: (1) whether ¶ 5-5-9 applies to VFR\n\naircraft, and, if so, (2) the scope of the controller's duty under\n\nthat provision.     I consider each of those in turn.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            Notwithstanding its assumption that ¶ 5-5-9 applies to\n\nVFR flights, the majority discusses the nature of that provision at\n\nsome length and appears to conclude that the classic rules of\n\nstatutory interpretation do not apply to it.            It points out that\n\nthe ATCM is neither a statute nor a regulation, but only an\n\ninternal FAA guideline that does \"not have the force of law.\"             It\n\neffectively treats the provision's scope as a question of fact by\n\nendorsing the district court's reliance on the government's expert,\n\nEdward Henderson, who testified that ¶ 5-5-9 could not apply once\n\nWojciechowicz's plane disappeared from the radar screen. Henderson\n\nalso testified that he had never seen ¶ 5-5-9 used for VFR\n\naircraft,   which   led   the   district   court   to   conclude   that   the\n\nprovision does not apply to VFR flights.\n\n\n                                   -31-\n\f           Paragraph   5-5-9,   however,      constitutes    more     than\n\nbackground guidance or advisory criteria whose applicability is\n\nleft to the controller's discretion.          Although this court has\n\nacknowledged the difficulty of distinguishing between law and\n\npractice – particularly where informal documents such as guidelines\n\nand handbooks are involved, see Nieves-Villanueva v. Soto-Rivera,\n\n133 F.3d 92, 100-01 (1st Cir. 1997) – no such difficulty exists\n\nhere. A Federal Aviation Regulation (\"FAR\"), 14 C.F.R. § 65.45(a),\n\nstates that “[a]n air traffic control tower operator shall perform\n\nhis duties in accordance with . . . the procedures and practices\n\nprescribed in air traffic control manuals of the FAA, to provide\n\nfor the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic.”19\n\nBecause part 65.45(a) mandates compliance with air traffic control\n\nmanuals,   the   manuals   themselves   are   incorporated     into    the\n\nregulation and acquire the force and effect of law.          See Ross v.\n\nUnited States, 640 F.2d 511, 517 (5th Cir. 1981) (per curiam,\n\naffirming on the basis of the district court's opinion) (stating\n\nthat provisions of a similar air traffic control manual have the\n\neffect of FAA regulations); see also Rodriquez v. United States,\n\n823 F.2d 735, 739 (3d Cir. 1987) (stating that FAR's \"have the\n\n\n\n\n     19\n         Although the regulation refers to \"control tower\noperator[s],\" courts have included air traffic controllers within\nits scope. See, e.g., Campos Viuda de Courtois v. United States,\n778 F. Supp. 585, 591 (D.P.R. 1991); In re N-500L Cases, 517 F.\nSupp. 825, 834 (D.P.R. 1981), aff'd, 691 F.2d 15 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\n                                 -32-\n\fforce and effect of law\"); In re N-500L Cases, 691 F.2d 15, 28 (1st\n\nCir. 1982) (same).20\n\n            Thus, ¶ 5-5-9 has the status of law and, as such, its\n\nmeaning must be determined in accordance with ordinary principles\n\nof statutory construction rather than by means of expert testimony.\n\nSee United States v. Lachman, 387 F.3d 42, 50-52 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(applying    canons    of   statutory   interpretation   to   federal\n\nregulations); Nieves-Villanueva, 133 F.3d at 100 (\"[I]t is for the\n\njudge, not the lawyers or the witnesses, to inform the jury of the\n\nlaw applicable in the case and to decide any purely legal issue.\").\n\nI thus begin by examining the language of the provision. See\n\nLachman, 387 F.3d at 50 (stating that, \"'if the language of a\n\n\n\n     20\n       Contrary to the majority's assertion, evaluating the ATCM\nas a provision of law is not inconsistent with First Circuit\nprecedent. The case cited by the majority, Federal Express Corp.\nv. Rhode Island, 664 F.2d 830, 835 (1st Cir. 1981), holds that\nviolations of the ATCM \"do not necessarily constitute negligence\"\n– a point with which I agree – but it does not hold that manual\nprovisions do not have the force of law. Indeed, Federal Express\nCorp. equates mandatory ATCM provisions with statutes and\nordinances.   See id. (\"Although slight deviations from manual\nprocedures do not necessarily constitute negligence, we have\npreviously indicated that 'a substantial and unjustified failure to\nfollow procedures made mandatory by the Manual is persuasive as an\nindication of a lack of due care.' The Rhode Island courts have\nembraced a similar position, holding that in an action based on\nviolation of a statute or ordinance, 'evidence of injury\nproximately caused by the violation is prima facie evidence of\ndefendant's liability . . . .'\") (citations omitted).\n     This is not to say that FAA documents that contain only\nadvisory criteria, and not binding rules, must also be given the\nforce and effect of law.      Ross, 640 F.2d at 518 (noting that\nanother FAA manual consisted of \"advisory criteria rather than\nbinding FAA regulations\").\n\n                                 -33-\n\fstatute or regulation has a plain and ordinary meaning, courts need\n\nlook no further and should apply the regulation as it is written'\"\n\n(quoting Textron, Inc. v. Comm'r, 336 F.3d 26, 31 (1st Cir.\n\n2003))).\n\n            The paragraph as written does not include an exception\n\nfor VFR aircraft and, in the absence of such an exclusion, there is\n\nno basis for concluding that the controller lacks separation\n\nresponsibility for VFR flights that are receiving radar services.\n\nSee Wojciechowicz v. United States, 576 F. Supp. 2d 241, 252\n\n(D.P.R. 2008) (stating that Wojciechowicz was receiving \"basic\n\nradar service\").      Although it is conceivable that VFR flights by\n\ndefinition would fall outside provisions requiring controllers to\n\nseparate   aircraft    from   obstructions   displayed       on   their     radar\n\nscopes, the next ¶ of the ATCM belies any such notion.                Paragraph\n\n5-5-10 addresses separation distances from \"adjacent airspace\" in\n\nwhich radar separation is also being used, and it excludes certain\n\nVFR aircraft from its dictates.       See ATCM, FAA Order 7110.65M § 5-\n\n5-10 (c) (“The provisions of subpara[graph]s a and b do not apply\n\nto   VFR   aircraft   being   provided     Class    B,   Class    C    or   TRSA\n\nservices.”).21     This   attention   to   VFR     flights   reinforces      the\n\n\n      21\n       Like ¶ 5-5-9, ¶ 5-5-10 specifies the separation distance\nthat controllers must maintain depending on the distance between\nthe aircraft and the radar antenna, or sensor, that is being used\nby the controller. After explicitly excluding certain categories\nof VFR flights from its coverage, the provision continues by\ndirecting a \"radar handoff\" or termination of radar service for VFR\nflights approaching the excluded types of airspace under the\n\n                                   -34-\n\finterpretation           that   such   flights    are   covered    by   the   radar\n\nseparation provisions unless explicitly excluded. See § 5-5-10(d).\n\n\"'[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of\n\na statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is\n\ngenerally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely\n\nin the disparate inclusion or exclusion.'\"                  Russello v. United\n\nStates, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (quoting United States v. Wong Kim\n\nBo, 472 F.2d 720, 722 (5th Cir. 1972)) (alteration in original);\n\nTrenkler v. United States, 268 F.3d 16, 23 (1st Cir. 2001).22                   That\n\nprinciple has no less force in this context.\n\n                Construing ¶ 5-5-9 to apply to VFR flights does not\n\nconflict with the VFR pilot's responsibility to see and avoid\n\nobstructions.        Controllers and pilots have a concurrent duty to\n\nmaintain safety, see, e.g., Delta Air Lines, 561 F.2d at 392\n\n(\"[A]lthough pilots are undoubtedly responsible for the safety of\n\ntheir        aircraft,    controllers    are     concurrently     responsible   for\n\nadhering to procedures which minimize the difficulties for the\n\n\n\n\ncontrol of another air traffic control facility.\n        22\n        The majority notes that the FAA-published Aeronautical\nInformation Manual (\"AIM\") expressly states that separation\nservices are not provided to VFR aircraft in Class E airspace. The\ndistrict court found that Wojciechowicz's plane entered Class G\nairspace one minute before the collision and flew in and out of\nClass G from that time until the crash, including \"at least the 10\nseconds prior to colliding with the terrain.\" Wojciechowicz, 576\nF. Supp. 2d at 251.\n\n                                         -35-\n\fcrew.\"), and the FAA has acknowledged that rules relating to pilots\n\nand controllers may overlap.       Section 5-5-1(e) of the AIM states:\n\n          The   responsibilities   of  the   pilot   and\n          controller intentionally overlap in many areas\n          providing a degree of redundancy. Should one\n          or the other fail in any manner, this\n          overlapping responsibility is expected to\n          compensate, in many cases, for failures that\n          may affect safety.\n\n          Imposing    the   duty    to    separate    under     ¶   5-5-9    on\n\ncontrollers for all flights receiving basic radar services is one\n\nobvious method to protect against unexpected \"failures that may\n\naffect safety.\"      Hence, I can only conclude that the plain,\n\nunlimited language of ¶ 5-5-9 governs and that the provision\n\napplies to VFR as well as IFR flights.          I therefore must consider\n\nthe scope of the duty imposed by the provision and whether it was\n\nbreached in the circumstances of this case.\n\n                                   III.\n\n          The   majority    explains     why   the   district   court   could\n\nproperly find that Santiago did not act unreasonably in failing to\n\ncontact Wojciechowicz before the plane disappeared from radar, when\n\nit was still approximately 4.7 miles from El Yunque.            Paragraph 5-\n\n5-9 prescribes a mandatory minimum of three miles, and the record\n\nshows that Wojciechowicz still had plenty of time at the 4.7-mile\n\npoint to change course and avoid crashing into the mountain.                The\n\nmajority errs, however, in deferring to the district court's\n\nconclusion that Santiago's duty ended when radar contact was lost.\n\n\n                                   -36-\n\fNothing in ¶ 5-5-9 suggests that the duty to separate aircraft from\n\nobstructions automatically dissolves when a plane receiving radar\n\nservices suddenly disappears from the screen. Indeed, no one would\n\nsuggest that the loss of radar contact with a flight operating\n\nunder instrument rules terminates the controller's duty to provide\n\nseparation services.\n\n          The majority holds that, in the absence of \"mandatory\n\nlanguage stating when a controller must take action to attempt to\n\nmaintain a separation,\" the district court permissibly treated the\n\nquestion of duty \"as one of what a reasonable controller would have\n\ndone on these particular facts.\"           I have no problem with the\n\nmajority's statement of the general principle.23         The majority goes\n\non to conclude, however, that the district court committed no clear\n\nerror in finding that it was reasonable for the controller to\n\nassume that the VFR pilot knew where he was and could see the\n\nmountain, and, on that basis, acted reasonably in failing to\n\nimmediately   initiate   contact    with   the   pilot    when   the   plane\n\ndisappeared from radar.\n\n\n     23\n        The majority asserts that I have improperly treated the\nquestion of the reasonableness of the controller's actions under ¶\n5-5-9 as one of law rather than fact.       This misrepresents my\nanalysis, which is consistent with our decision in Federal Express\nCorp., 664 F.2d at 835. We held there that \"[t]he existence and\nextent of a duty of care are questions of law; whether any such\nduty has been breached and whether proximate cause exists are\nquestions for the factfinder, whose determination is binding on\nappeal unless clearly erroneous.\"      Id.  My analysis considers\n\"[t]he existence and extent\" of the controller's duty under ¶ 5-5-9\nas a question of law and the issue of breach as a factual question.\n\n                                   -37-\n\f          As I have explained, ¶ 5-5-9 has no purpose in the VFR\n\ncontext unless it is to serve as backup protection against the\n\npossibility of pilot negligence.    In imposing a concurrent duty on\n\ncontrollers to separate VFR flights from obstructions, ¶ 5-5-9\n\neffectively incorporates an assumption that pilot negligence is\n\nforeseeable.   The fact that Wojciechowicz, as a VFR pilot, should\n\nhave been aware of his surroundings is thus besides the point, and\n\nthe controller's duty under ¶ 5-5-9 is no different for VFR flights\n\nthan for IFR flights.   If a plane is no longer visible on the radar\n\nscreen, the only way for the controller to be sure there is proper\n\nseparation between that aircraft and prominent obstructions is to\n\ncontact the pilot directly.    From that perspective, it is apparent\n\nthat Santiago's duty under ¶ 5-5-9 could not automatically end with\n\nthe loss of radar contact.    Rather, as with an IFR flight, the duty\n\nto maintain separation required him to make reasonable efforts to\n\ncontact Wojciechowicz to ensure that the aircraft remained three\n\nmiles away from El Yunque.    It was foreseeable that, in the event\n\nof pilot negligence, Santiago's failure to take that step could be\n\ndisastrous.\n\n          Santiago’s own actions and testimony indicate that he was\n\naware of his responsibility to attempt to contact Wojciechowicz.\n\nAlthough Santiago testified that short-term loss of radar contact\n\nwith an aircraft is not unusual, he acknowledged that if an\n\naircraft disappears from his scope, he would, “most frankly,”\n\n\n                                 -38-\n\finform that aircraft that radar contact was lost.            He explained\n\nthat he does not necessarily inform a pilot that radar contact is\n\nlost when the plane's data is in \"coast\" mode – the short period\n\nimmediately after the loss of radar contact when the computer\n\npredicts the flight's likely path – because planes sometimes will\n\n\"go into coast . . . and then they'll come back.\"              The flight\n\ntranscript shows that Santiago attempted to reach Wojciechowicz's\n\nplane by radio more than a dozen times, starting at 43 seconds\n\nafter the plane's coast data disappeared from the radar scope\n\n(roughly the time of the crash).24\n\n            The district court's view that Santiago's duty under ¶ 5-\n\n5-9 ended when the plane was no longer visible on radar is thus\n\nunsupportable.     That legal error infected the district court's\n\nfact-finding     and   undermines   the    majority's   reliance   on     it.\n\nExamining the record in light of the proper scope of ¶ 5-5-9, the\n\nremaining   question    is   whether   Santiago   breached   his   duty    to\n\nmaintain separation by failing to contact the pilot for 43 seconds\n\nafter all radar information about the flight ended.          I now turn to\n\nthat question.\n\n\n\n\n     24\n       The district court found that the plane crashed about two\nseconds later, \"approximately 45 seconds\" after the last coast data\nappeared. Wojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 259.\n\n                                    -39-\n\f                                   IV.\n\n             In one sense, it is undisputed that Santiago failed to\n\nperform his duty to ensure three miles of separation between the\n\nplane and prominent obstructions.          The aircraft was permitted to\n\npenetrate the three-mile “ring” around El Yunque and crashed 1.43\n\nmiles from the mountain’s peak.     Wojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n246.   The majority is correct, however, that simple breach of the\n\nduty does not amount to negligence, and the issue before us turns\n\non   \"what   a   reasonable   controller    would   have   done   on   these\n\nparticular facts\" to fulfill his duty under ¶ 5-5-9.         Santiago did\n\nattempt to contact the pilot.      Hence, the specific question to be\n\naddressed is whether his delay in doing so was reasonable.\n\n             The record shows that a reasonable factfinder would have\n\nto conclude that it was not.      Santiago knew or should have known,\n\nbased on the information displayed on his scope, that at the moment\n\nactual radar contact was lost, the airplane was only 1.7 miles away\n\nfrom the three-mile ring – the minimum distance for separation\n\nspecified in ¶ 5-5-9.     See Wojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 259.\n\nHe also knew that the plane was headed toward the mountain.            Even\n\nif a three-mile separation was no longer feasible, Santiago at\n\nleast needed to take all reasonable steps to contact Wojciechowicz\n\nearly enough to guide the plane away from the mountain in case the\n\npilot inexplicably failed to change direction on his own.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -40-\n\f           The government's expert testified that Wojciechowicz\n\ncould have maneuvered the plane away from the accident site within\n\n17 or 18 seconds.     The last coast data appeared on radar at about\n\n45 seconds before the crash.       Id.    Accepting the end of all data as\n\na   reasonable    trigger   for   the    controller's   concern,     and   even\n\nallowing for a brief delay as Santiago came to the realization that\n\nthe plane had not reappeared on the radar scope, Santiago still had\n\nmore than thirty seconds to attempt to turn the aircraft before the\n\nimpact occurred – nearly double the time needed.                    He waited,\n\nhowever, until virtually the time of impact to initiate radio\n\ncontact.     On    this     record,     that   delay   can   only    be    found\n\nunreasonable.25     I realize that thirty seconds is not much time.\n\n\n      25\n       The majority states        that reliance on a duty to separate\nwithin thirty seconds after       the coast data disappeared introduces\na new theory to the case.         That is not so. Plaintiffs make the\nfollowing argument in their       brief:\n\n      [T]he district court's finding that \"[t]he last 'coast'\n      data block on the Aircraft was seen at 2:21:42 p.m.,\n      approximately 45 seconds prior to the crash,\" also\n      undercuts the court's conclusion that it would have been\n      impossible for Santiago to have complied with § 5-5-\n      9. . . . Based upon any reasonable view of the evidence,\n      Controller Santiago had sufficient information and time\n      to issue a separation instruction to the Aircraft, as\n      required by § 5-5-9. This analysis is also consistent\n      with the testimony of the government's piloting expert\n      who testified that Mr. Wojciechowicz, the pilot, could\n      have climbed the Aircraft out of its predicament at a\n      point as late as 17 or 18 seconds prior to impact.\n\nAlthough the plaintiffs' timing discussion focused primarily on the\ncontention that Santiago needed to contact the plane before it\nreached the three-mile minimum distance from obstructions, the\nunderlying theory is the same whether the focus is the three-mile\n\n                                      -41-\n\fIn the business of air traffic control, however, split seconds\n\nmatter, and the stakes are enormous. If Santiago had fulfilled his\n\nduty under ¶ 5-5-9 of the ATCM – to \"separate [the] aircraft from\n\n[the] prominent obstruction[] depicted on the radar scope\" – this\n\naccident may have been avoided.26\n\n                The majority observes in a footnote that there was no\n\nevidence presented that Santiago could have reached the plane by\n\nradio if he had tried earlier.               To the contrary, Santiago and\n\nWojciechowicz had been communicating by radio, showing that the\n\nradio was functioning properly.             There is no basis for concluding\n\nthat the radio would have suddenly failed before the plane crashed.\n\n                Nor is there any reason to think that Santiago could not\n\nhave guided the change of course within the 17 or 18 seconds the\n\nexpert estimated would ordinarily be necessary.               The record shows\n\nthat,        despite   the   lack   of   radar   contact,   Santiago   had   some\n\nawareness of the airplane’s location. After the crash, he directed\n\n\nminimum or separation from the mountain itself                   –   i.e.,   that\nSantiago had a duty to act before it was too late.\n        26\n         I do not suggest that the government bore full, or even\nsubstantial, responsibility for the crash. Under Puerto Rico law,\nwhere the relative fault of the plaintiff and defendant is taken\ninto account, a factfinder properly could have concluded that the\ngovernment was responsible for only a small percentage of the\ndamages. See, e.g., Campos Viuda de Courtois, 778 F. Supp. at 590\n(\"[I]f both the plaintiff and defendant are at fault, the plaintiff\ncan still recover, but his recovery is limited to the proportion of\ndamages sustained by the plaintiff that were proximately caused by\nthe defendant's negligence.\"); P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5141\n(\"Concurrent imprudence of the party aggrieved does not exempt from\nliability, but entails a reduction of the indemnity.\").\n\n                                         -42-\n\fnumerous planes and police helicopters directly to the crash site,\n\nat one point stating that “once you get close to the area I’ll give\n\nyou a point out.”           Therefore, regardless of the pilot’s own\n\ndisorientation, Santiago had sufficient knowledge of the plane’s\n\nwhereabouts to accomplish the required separation.\n\n                                         V.\n\n            The tragic result in this case might have been avoided if\n\nthe government had performed its duty under ¶ 5-5-9 to maintain a\n\nthree-mile separation between Wojciechowicz's plane and El Yunque.\n\nThe plain language of the provision extends the duty                to separate\n\naircraft from obstructions to IFR and VFR flights alike, and that\n\nduty does not terminate when radar contact is lost unexpectedly.\n\nIndeed, even under VFR conditions, the unexplained loss of all\n\nradar   contact     when    a   plane    is    heading   directly    toward   an\n\nobstruction   and    nearing     the    three-mile     safety   barrier   should\n\ntrigger the controller's immediate concern.               To fulfill his duty\n\nunder ¶ 5-5-9, the controller had to act quickly to contact\n\nWojciechowicz so that, if necessary, he could guide the pilot in\n\nseparating the plane from El Yunque.             In the circumstances here,\n\nSantiago's 43-second delay before attempting such contact was\n\nunreasonable.\n\n            In concluding that the district court committed no clear\n\nerror in evaluating the facts, the majority misconstrues the law\n\nand   the   principle      of   concurrent     duty.     The    government    has\n\n\n                                        -43-\n\fundertaken to act as a safeguard to potential pilot negligence, and\n\nwhen it performs that function negligently, its actions cannot be\n\ninsulated from review because of the pilot's errors.           Sadly, it\n\ntakes only a few seconds of inattention on the part of an air\n\ntraffic controller for tragedy to strike.         I would reverse and\n\nremand   with   instructions   that   the   district   court   apportion\n\nresponsibility for the tragedy between the pilot and the controller\n\nunder Puerto Rico's tort law.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -44-\n\f",

We affirm the entry of judgment for the United States\n\nagainst plaintiffs' claim of air traffic controller liability in a\n\nhighly fact based tort case.\n\n           On the afternoon of January 5, 2002, a small Cessna\n\nConquest airplane flown by Alexander Wojciechowicz crashed into\n\nhigh terrain in the Carribean National Forest near the El Yunque\n\nmountain   peak    in   Puerto    Rico.       Wojciechowicz    and    his    four\n\npassengers, members of his family, were killed.               Plaintiffs, who\n\ninclude Wojciechowicz's surviving relatives, his and his daughter's\n\nestates,   the    aircraft's     registered    owner,   and   the    aircraft's\n\ninsurer, sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act\n\n(\"FTCA\"), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2671, alleging the air traffic\n\ncontroller on duty in San Juan, Marcos Santiago, was negligent.\n\n           After    a   twelve-day    bench    trial,   the   district      court\n\nultimately found that Santiago could not have reasonably foreseen\n\nWojciechowicz would take the actions he did, which were in direct\n\nviolation of a pilot's duties, that Santiago's actions or inactions\n\nwere not a proximate cause of the crash, and that Wojciechowicz's\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fown negligence was the sole cause of the crash.             The court also\n\nfound that the controller had not violated any duty of care; but\n\neven if the controller did violate a duty, the court found that any\n\nviolation did not cause the crash.              The judge apportioned no\n\nliability to the government.       Wojciechowicz v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 278 (D.P.R. 2008).\n\n           On appeal, plaintiffs claim the district court primarily\n\nerred in finding there was no duty of care stemming from a Federal\n\nAviation Administration (\"FAA\") operations manual and FAA training\n\ninstructions.      They say this error infected the later findings,\n\nwhich, they say, are clearly erroneous anyway.         First, they argue,\n\nthe court erroneously held that ¶ 5-5-9 of the FAA Air Traffic\n\nControl   Manual    (\"ATCM\"),    FAA    Order   7110.65M,   which   requires\n\ncontrollers to maintain separation of aircraft from prominent\n\nobstructions depicted on the radar screen by specified minimum\n\ndistances, did not apply to Wojciechowicz's flight, which was under\n\nVisual Flight Rules (\"VFR\") (as opposed to Instrument Flight Rules\n\n(\"IFR\")), and that Santiago owed no duty to warn Wojciechowicz to\n\nchange course.     Second, they argue the court erred in holding that\n\nthe air traffic control authority, the San Juan Combined Enroute\n\nand Radar Approach Control Facility (\"CERAP\"), was authorized to\n\ndepart from the FAA's curriculum in training Santiago and that it\n\ntrained him adequately.         See FAA Air Traffic Technical Training\n\nManual, FAA Order 3120.4J.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f              The record supports the district court's findings that\n\nplaintiffs     nonetheless       failed    to   meet       their   burden     to   show\n\nnegligence or causation.           We reject plaintiffs' arguments that\n\nthese findings were clearly erroneous and affirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n              We outline the facts. Greater detail may be found in the\n\ndistrict court's opinion.          Wojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 246-\n\n51.\n\n              Wojciechowicz owned a vacation home on Culebra Island and\n\nwas an experienced pilot with nearly four thousand hours of flight\n\nexperience.     He had flown the route between Culebra Island and the\n\nSan Juan airport over two hundred times and was familiar both with\n\nthe approach to the airport and with El Yunque and the surrounding\n\nterrain.      He was rated for flight under both IFR and VFR.\n\n              At approximately 2:00 p.m. that day, Wojciechowicz took\n\noff from Culebra Island, which is eighteen nautical miles east of\n\nthe    east   coast     of    Puerto   Rico,    for    a    flight      to   San   Juan\n\nInternational Airport.           The trip can be completed in twenty to\n\nthirty minutes.\n\n              Wojciechowicz chose to fly under VFR.                  His choice had\n\nseveral consequences.           Under VFR procedures, set forth in FAA\n\nregulations and the FAA-published Aeronautical Information Manual\n\n(\"AIM\"), a pilot navigates by observing the surroundings rather\n\nthan    by    relying    on    instruments.           As    a   pilot    under     VFR,\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fWojciechowicz was forbidden by FAA regulations from flying into\n\nclouds or into areas of reduced visibility unless he asked the\n\ncontroller for permission to do so.      See 14 C.F.R. § 91.155; In re\n\nN-500L Cases, 691 F.2d at 28-29; Cappello v. Duncan Aircraft Sales\n\nof Fla., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715652\"><a href=\"/opinion/715652/phillip-r-and-edna-cappello-individually-and-phillip-r-cappello-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1465</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1467, 1469 (6th Cir. 1996).          Although\n\nhe never asked for permission, the pilot did exactly that.\n\n           By contrast, pilots under IFR must file a special flight\n\nplan, must navigate by use of their instruments, and may not fly\n\nbelow Minimum Vectoring Altitude (\"MVA\"), which is generally set at\n\ntwo thousand feet above the elevation of the terrain.           VFR pilots\n\nare not so restricted and may fly below both the MVA and the\n\nelevation of nearby terrain.     See Biles v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"507137\"><a href=\"/opinion/507137/deborah-biles-administratrix-of-the-estate-of-dennis-b-biles-plaintiff/\"><span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">661</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 663 (5th Cir. 1988).     In sparsely populated areas, such as the\n\narea in which the crash occurred, there is no restriction on how\n\nlow a VFR pilot may fly except that the pilot must maintain a\n\nminimum distance of five hundred feet laterally from any structure,\n\nvehicle, or person. 14 C.F.R. § 91.119(c). Wojciechowicz operated\n\nunder VFR procedures throughout the flight.\n\n           Wojciechowicz contacted CERAP by radio in San Juan at\n\n2:18 p.m., about eighteen minutes after he left Culebra, to request\n\nlanding at Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport in San Juan.           He\n\nwas then ten miles east of Fajardo, Puerto Rico, and traveling at\n\n190 knots, or about three miles per minute.          At 2:18:30 p.m.,\n\nSantiago   requested   that   Wojciechowicz   \"squawk\"   0477    into   his\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\faircraft's transponder to allow Santiago's radar scope to better\n\nidentify      the   aircraft.1    Wojciechowicz       complied.     Santiago\n\nresponded to Wojciechowicz's landing request at 2:19:54 p.m.,\n\nproviding him with an approach vector to the airport from the\n\ntraffic pattern south of Plaza Carolina and weather information for\n\nSan Juan.      Santiago asked Wojciechowicz to state his altitude.\n\nWojciechowicz replied that he was at 1600 feet above sea level and\n\nstated   he    would   stay   south   at    Plaza   Carolina.     During   his\n\ncommunications with Santiago, Wojciechowicz gave no indication that\n\nhe was in any distress, that he was unaware of his altitude or\n\nlocation, that he could not maintain his own separation from\n\nterrain, or that he was in need of navigation assistance.\n\n              This was the first and only conversation between the\n\ncontroller Santiago and the pilot and it took place between 2:18\n\nand 2:20:37.\n\n              At that point, the plane was in clear air and had at\n\nleast ten miles of visibility.        That meant the pilot could clearly\n\nsee the rising terrain to El Yunque ahead and the north coast of\n\nPuerto Rico, where the airport was, to his right.           The pilot could\n\nalso see there was a cloud base intersecting the rising terrain\n\nahead.\n\n\n\n     1\n          A controller gives a pilot a \"squawk,\" or a radar\nidentification code, for the pilot to input into the plane's\ntransponder that identifies the flight on the radar scope. See\nCappello, 79 F.3d at 1468 n.1.\n\n                                      -7-\n\f                  After the conversation ended, the plane continued on\n\nSantiago's radar for nearly one more minute but disappeared from\n\nthe radar scope shortly before the accident.                    In the time the\n\naircraft remained on the radar, Wojciechowicz made no further\n\nattempts to contact Santiago by radio.            The last radar data for the\n\nplane was received at 2:21:18.            After radar contact was lost, the\n\nplane's data on the airport radar scope entered \"coast\" mode, in\n\nwhich the computer indicates radar contact is lost and predicts the\n\naircraft's         position.2    The    last   coast   data   was   displayed    at\n\n2:21:42.          Within forty-three seconds, Santiago was on the radio\n\ntrying to get a response, without success, from the pilot.                      The\n\nendpoint, the crash, occurred at approximately 2:23 p.m. at a point\n\n1.43 miles northeast of the El Yunque peak and at an elevation of\n\n1561 feet (El Yunque itself is 3637 feet tall).\n\n                  We return to what Santiago knew from the radar.         At the\n\npoint       the    plane   disappeared    from   the   radar,    the   plane    was\n\napproximately 4.7 miles from the peak of El Yunque.                 Wojciechowicz\n\nat that point had ample visibility (of approximately three nautical\n\nmiles) to allow him to see the clouds he was approaching ahead and\n\nan area of clear weather and lower terrain to the north to which he\n\ncould       safely    turn.     The    government's    expert    testified     that\n\n\n        2\n          Plaintiffs say that Santiago also had available to him a\n\"vector link,\" a feature that, when activated by the controller,\ndisplayed the computer's prediction of where the aircraft would fly\nminutes into the future. This information is immaterial to the\ndistrict court's findings.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fWojciechowicz could easily have avoided the crash by changing\n\ncourse.   He testified that Wojciechowicz would have needed only\n\nseventeen to eighteen seconds to maneuver away from the accident\n\nsite.\n\n           The district court made findings about what information\n\nwas   available   to   Santiago   when   there   was   radar   contact.\n\nSantiago's radar scope showed Wojciechowicz's altitude above sea\n\nlevel and displayed MVA data for the surrounding area, but it did\n\nnot display terrain features, the elevation of the terrain, or the\n\naircraft's altitude above the ground.            The scope did display\n\nprominent obstructions, including El Yunque peak, which had a\n\ncommunications tower located on it.      It did not, however, display\n\nthe elevation of the tower or of El Yunque.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           Plaintiffs brought three lawsuits, seeking recovery for\n\nthe wrongful deaths of Wojciechowicz and one of his passengers,\n\ncontribution for money the insurers had paid to settle a state\n\ncourt suit brought by relatives of two other passengers, and\n\ncontribution for funds paid by the insurer for the destruction of\n\nthe aircraft. On December 10, 2004, the district court granted the\n\ngovernment's motion to consolidate the cases.\n\n           Plaintiffs conceded that Wojciechowicz had been negligent\n\nbut argued the government was partially at fault for the crash.\n\nThey claimed Santiago had negligently failed to separate the flight\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\ffrom El Yunque peak by at least three miles, which they claim is\n\nrequired by ¶ 5-5-9 of the ATCM.3 They also claimed CERAP had\n\nfailed to train and test Santiago on significant terrain areas and\n\nobstructions as required by a curriculum contained in the FAA's Air\n\nTraffic Technical Training Order, FAA Order 3120.4J.4   They argued\n\nthat had Santiago been more familiar with the terrain, he would\n\nhave issued a safety alert to Wojciechowicz, and this alert would\n\nhave resulted in avoidance of the crash.\n\n          Paragraph 5-5-9 of the ATCM, titled \"Separation from\n\nObstructions,\" sits within Chapter 5 of the manual, titled \"Radar,\"\n\nand Section 5 of that chapter, titled \"Radar Separation.\"       It\n\nstates in relevant part:\n\n          [S]eparate     aircraft     from     prominent\n          obstructions depicted on the radar scope . . .\n          by the following minima:\n          1. When less than 40 miles from the antenna -\n          3 miles.\n          2. When 40 miles or more from the antenna - 5\n          miles.5\n\n\n\n     3\n          The United States argued that Santiago had no duty under\n¶ 5-5-9 to separate Wojciechowicz's flight from El Yunque because\n¶ 5-5-9 applies only for IFR flights and that even if Santiago had\na duty to separate Wojciechowicz's flight, he did not breach his\nduty.\n     4\n          The government argued that local air traffic control\nauthorities had the authority to modify Order 3120.4J's curriculum\nand that Santiago had received adequate training.\n     5\n          The provision refers to two exceptions.      It does not\napply in \"En Route Stage A/DARC or Stage A/EDARC.\"        There is\nnothing in the record about these exceptions, but the parties agree\nthey do not apply to this case.\n\n                               -10-\n\fATCM ¶ 5-5-9 (emphasis in original). Here, the required separation\n\nwas three miles.\n\n            While plaintiffs' case rests largely on ATCM ¶ 5-5-9 and\n\nthe   training   order,      also    pertinent   to   the    case    are    the   FAA\n\nregulations, other provisions of the ATCM, and provisions of other\n\nFAA manuals.      The FAA has promulgated regulations that govern\n\npilots' operations.         See 14 C.F.R. pt. 91.     These regulations have\n\nthe force and effect of law, but here the plaintiffs do not claim\n\na   violation    of   the    C.F.R.      In    addition,     the    FAA    publishes\n\noperations manuals, including the ATCM for controllers and the AIM\n\nfor pilots.\n\n            The controlling law of this circuit is that the ATCM is\n\nnot a statute or a regulation but an internal FAA guideline issued\n\nto FAA controllers, which governs their conduct.                   As such, under\n\nour   case law the ATCM is merely an indication of the standard of\n\ncare.     Fed. Express Corp., 664 F.2d at 835.                Further, we treat\n\n\"substantial\"     failures      to    adhere   to   the     ATCM    guidelines     as\n\n\"persuasive as an indication of a lack of due care.\"                 Id. (quoting\n\nDelta Air Lines, Inc., 561 F.2d at 390).6\n\n            Independently of ¶ 5-5-9's separation requirement, ATCM\n\n¶ 2-1-6 requires a controller to issue a safety alert to the pilot\n\n\n\n      6\n          In arguing that the ATCM carries the force of law, the\ndissent mischaracterizes the law in this circuit. This panel is\nbound by circuit precedent, which only an en banc court can change.\nUnited States v.

Like the ATCM, the AIM is merely indicative of the\n\nstandard of care.           Id.; Delta Air Lines, Inc., 561 F.2d at 390.\n\nSeveral of its provisions also discuss the conduct of air traffic\n\ncontrollers.        Paragraph 5-5-8 of the AIM states that a pilot \"is\n\nresponsible to see and avoid other traffic, terrain, or obstacles.\"\n\nThat provision also says that a controller will issue a safety\n\nalert \"if aware the aircraft is at an altitude believed to place\n\nthe aircraft in unsafe proximity to terrain, obstructions, or other\n\naircraft.\"\n\n              A    separate      provision,      ¶    3-2-6(f),     states    that   \"no\n\nseparation services are provided to VFR aircraft\" in Class E\n\nairspace,     the        class   of   airspace       in    which   Wojciechowicz     was\n\noperating at all pertinent times.                    In addition, AIM § 4-1-17(e)\n\nprovides that VFR pilots are not relieved of their responsibilities\n\nto \"maintain appropriate terrain and obstruction clearance, or to\n\nremain in [VFR-appropriate] weather conditions\" by the fact that\n\nthey are receiving basic radar services from a terminal.\n\n              Finally, FAA Order 3120.4J is an FAA operating manual\n\naddressed to air traffic control authorities.                       It sets forth a\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fnational curriculum for training controllers.     Two provisions of\n\nOrder 3120.4J set forth training exercises under which a trainee is\n\nrequired to label or draw topographical features on an unlabeled\n\nchart of the local area and to identify significant terrain areas\n\nand obstructions on an unlabeled video map.7\n\n          The district court entered judgment in favor of the\n\nUnited States.   It held that ATCM ¶ 5-5-9 did not apply to VFR\n\nflights but only to IFR flights.        It further found that, even\n\nassuming ATCM ¶ 5-5-9 did apply to VFR flights, Santiago did not\n\nviolate the provision because the last radar information he had for\n\nthe flight came well before it entered the three-mile radius around\n\nEl Yunque.   Wojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 269.   Crediting the\n\ntestimony of the government's expert witness, Edward Henderson,\n\nthat ¶ 5-5-9 requires a \"radar separation,\" the court held that\n\n\"[w]ithout the aircraft remaining in radar contact it would have\n\nbeen impossible for Mr. Santiago to apply the aforementioned radar\n\nseparation criteria to N441AW.    Thus, the provisions of [¶] 5-5-9\n\ncould not have been implemented because the aircraft was not\n\nvisible on Mr. Santiago's radar scope.\"     Id.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n          Plaintiffs cite Courses 55060 and 55065. Course 55060\nstates, \"Given an unlabeled chart of the local area . . . the\nindividual shall label or draw the following: . . . Topographical\nfeatures.\"    Course 55065 states, \"Given an unlabeled video\nmap/overlay, the individual shall identify all items, plus . . .\nSignificant terrain areas and obstructions.\"\n\n                                 -13-\n\f          The court also found that Santiago did not violate his\n\nseparate duty under ATCM ¶ 2-1-6.          It found the data available to\n\nSantiago did not provide him with information about the plane's\n\nproximity to terrain, and, because Wojciechowicz was operating as\n\na VFR pilot, Santiago did not know his intentions as to his route.\n\nSantiago was therefore not aware that Wojciechowicz was in a\n\nposition which, in Santiago's judgment, placed him in unsafe\n\nproximity to terrain.      Id. at 258-60.\n\n          As to the second issue, the court held that CERAP had\n\nleeway to adapt Order 3120.4J's curriculum to local requirements\n\nand that it had adequately trained Santiago on terrain features by\n\ninstructing him on local MVA information.              Further, the court\n\nfound, any deficiency in training did not cause plaintiffs' harm.\n\nThe general terrain knowledge the training would have provided\n\nwould not have given Santiago sufficient information regarding the\n\nflight's unsafe proximity to terrain to require the issuance of a\n\nsafety alert.   Id. at 259-60, 262.\n\n          The   district    court    also    found    that   \"even   assuming\n\narguendo that a duty had been owed and breached by the controller\n\n. . ., plaintiffs ha[d] failed to prove that any such breach was\n\nthe cause of the crash . . . or that the pilot's actions in this\n\ncase were foreseeable.\"        Id. at 277.

Plaintiffs' Claims under ATCM    ¶ 5-5-9 (Controllers'\n          Duties as to Separation from Obstructions)\n\n          The government argues that the standard of care under\n\n¶ 5-5-9 of the ATCM, assuming it applies to VFR flights at all,\n\nturns on what a reasonable controller in Santiago's situation would\n\nhave done given the information he had available to him, the fact\n\nthat Wojciechowicz was operating as a VFR pilot, and the fact that\n\nat a point before the buffer zone the plane was no longer on the\n\ncontroller's radar screen.\n\n          Plaintiffs' core argument is that Santiago was in breach\n\nof the ATCM ¶ 5-5-9 and that this was negligence per se, so they\n\nneed not prove causation.    As required by our precedent, we reject\n\nthe argument that the ATCM has the same effect as a regulation and\n\nthat any violation would be negligence per se. Fed. Express Corp.,\n\n664 F.2d at 835.\n\n          Plaintiffs also argue that they have established both a\n\nviolation of ¶ 5-5-9 and causation.     They say that although the\n\n\n     10\n          Plaintiffs often ignore this principle by proceeding\nbackwards from the information now known and arguing about whether\nSantiago's actions were reasonable given this knowledge.       The\nappropriate inquiry focuses on what was known to the controller at\nthe time. Kelley v. Schlumberger Tech.

We turn to\n\nthe first contention.\n\n           Plaintiffs' theory is that even though Santiago could not\n\nhave foreseen Wojciechowicz's actions, that is immaterial because\n\nSantiago was under a legal duty to keep a separation of three miles\n\nbetween the plane and the El Yunque tower marked on his radar and\n\nbecause   the   controller   breached    this   duty   by   not   issuing   a\n\nseparation order well before the plane neared the buffer zone.              If\n\nSantiago had done so, they argue, Wojciechowicz would have been\n\nalerted to the danger and would have changed course.\n\n           This argument goes to when separation must be maintained.\n\nIt suffers from the obvious problem that there was no violation of\n\nthe plain text of ¶ 5-5-9, which states only the three-mile\n\nseparation minimum.    The provision contains no mandatory language\n\nstating when a controller must take action to attempt to maintain\n\na separation.    Given the lack of mandatory language in ¶ 5-5-9 on\n\nthe issue of when to maintain the separation, the district court\n\ncorrectly understood the question posed by plaintiffs as one of\n\n\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fwhat a reasonable controller would have done on these particular\n\nfacts.11\n\n                Further, plaintiffs have not articulated any clear theory\n\non when separation must be initiated.          James Parham,   plaintiffs'\n\nexpert     on    air   traffic   control   procedures,   testified   that   a\n\nreasonable and prudent controller would have given a separation\n\norder when Wojciechowicz was seven miles away from El Yunque and\n\nfour miles from the three-mile buffer zone to give the pilot time\n\nto comply and to avoid the obstruction.          However, this was merely\n\nParham's opinion; Parham did not testify about actual practice\n\nunder ¶ 5-5-9.\n\n                Under our case law, actual practice under a regulation or\n\nordinance is important to determining its meaning and may become\n\nanother source of a legal obligation.

No evidence of actual\n\npractice from the plaintiffs as to the interpretation of ATCM ¶ 5-\n\n5-9 was admitted.        The court was not required to accept Parham's\n\n\n\n\n     11\n          The dissent, contrary to our law, characterizes this\nquestion as one of law for a judge to decide and not a question of\nfact. The reasonableness of a controller's action is in this case\na question of fact. Thus we have held that \"[i]n deciding what a\nreasonable person could do, a jury's latitude is considerable.\"\nRodríguez-Quiñones, 402 F.3d at 256.\n\n                                      -21-\n\fview, which was inherently inconsistent with the testimony of the\n\ngovernment's expert.\n\n          The district court found that a reasonable controller,\n\ngiven the facts of this case, would not have separated the flight\n\nat (or before) 4.7 miles.12 That was because it was more reasonable\n\nfor the controller at that point to rely on the VFR pilot, who, the\n\ncontroller could assume, was complying with his duties to see and\n\navoid terrain and obstacles and to maintain VFR-minimum visibility.\n\nThe pilot then had clear visibility.     Wojciechowicz had given no\n\nindication that he was in distress or unable to comply with his\n\nobligations, and he would have had ample time to change course at\n\nfour miles out.13\n\n          The court's finding was not clear error.    Wojciechowicz\n\nwas under a legal duty to know the route and to have consulted maps\n\nof the area.    See Cappello, 79 F.3d at 1468.   There is no serious\n\ncontention that the pilot did not know where El Yunque was.      In\n\ncontrast, Santiago did not then know the plane's course or altitude\n\nor whether it was approaching or turning away from the obstruction,\n\nEl Yunque.     And of course, the plane disappeared from Santiago's\n\n\n     12\n          The dissent advances a new theory that the controller had\na duty to separate within thirty seconds after the last coast data\ndisappeared from his radar scope; however, this was not argued by\nany party to the case.\n     13\n          Contrary to the dissent, this case does not turn on any\nrule that mere loss of radar contact, regardless of the surrounding\ncircumstances, would vitiate a legal duty which had already arisen\nunder ¶ 5-5-9.\n\n                                -22-\n\fradar and Santiago's attempts to reestablish contact with it were\n\nunsuccessful.\n\n          Moreover, the government proffered a separate defense\n\nthat ¶ 5-5-9 could not apply under these circumstances. First, the\n\ncourt accepted the testimony from the government expert, Edward\n\nHenderson, elicited on cross-examination by plaintiffs' counsel,\n\nthat even assuming ¶ 5-5-9 applied to VFR flights, there was no\n\nviolation of ¶ 5-5-9 here because, flying under VFR, the pilot\n\ncould have changed direction or altitude at any time and the\n\ncontroller would therefore not have known whether the aircraft came\n\nwithin three miles of El Yunque.    He further testified that ¶ 5-5-9\n\nrequires \"a radar separation. And [Santiago did not] have radar on\n\nthe aircraft\" after the plane disappeared from the radar screen.\n\nThis testimony, against the background facts, is consistent with\n\nand sufficient to support the district court's conclusion that\n\nthere was no breach of any standard of care under ¶ 5-5-9, even\n\nassuming it applied to VFR flights, and further, beyond duty, that\n\nthere was no causal connection.14\n\n          Plaintiffs have also failed to show clear error in the\n\ncourt's finding that, even if Santiago had owed and breached a duty\n\nunder ¶ 5-5-9, there was no causal connection between any breach by\n\n\n     14\n          There was also no evidence presented that Santiago could\nhave reached the plane by radio contact if he had tried to do so\ninstantaneously with losing radar contact or at any point before\nthe crash, or that the pilot was then in control of the plane.\nPlaintiffs bear the burden of proof.\n\n                               -23-\n\fSantiago   and   the   accident,   or   the   court's   findings   that   the\n\naccident was not foreseeable to Santiago.\n\n           Wojciechowicz was already required by FAA regulations to\n\nchange course and avoid flying into the clouds.              Those clouds\n\nintersected with the terrain near the crash site and obscured\n\nvisibility.      See 14 C.F.R. § 91.155; Cappello, 79 F.3d at 1469.\n\nThe district court concluded that \"[h]ad Mr. Wojciechowicz not\n\nentered the clouds he would have had ample time to see and avoid\n\nthe terrain with which he ultimately collided.\" Wojciechowicz, 576\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 255.     The court supportably found the cause of the\n\ncrash was not that the flight came closer than three miles to the\n\nradar tower on El Yunque or that it was flying in high terrain, but\n\nthat the pilot flew into a cloud in violation of FAA regulations.\n\n           Further, as the district court found, Santiago could not\n\nhave reasonably foreseen that Wojciechowicz would take the actions\n\nthat the district court found led to the accident, specifically\n\n\"fly[ing] into a cloud while traversing rugged, rising terrain at\n\nlow altitude and high speed.\"       Wojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n277.   A VFR pilot can change course and altitude at any time and\n\nwithout need to obtain permission from the controller.             See In re\n\nN-500L Cases, 691 F.2d at 31; Cappello, 79 F.3d at 1469.            Santiago\n\nhad no reason other than speculation to think that the flight was\n\nheading directly into a cloud.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fB.        ATCM ¶ 2-1-6 (Safety Alert)\n\n          Plaintiffs argue that Santiago was also in breach of his\n\nduty under ATCM ¶ 2-1-6 to issue a safety alert to Wojciechowicz\n\nbecause of his unsafe proximity to the terrain.          Whether this\n\nprovision is evidence giving rise to a duty in the controller to\n\nissue a safety alert turns on the information available to the\n\ncontroller. The duty arises when the controller is \"aware that the\n\naircraft is in a position or altitude which, in the controller's\n\njudgment, places the aircraft in unsafe proximity to terrain or\n\nobstructions.\"15    Wojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 258 (emphasis\n\nin original).      Here, the district court supportably found these\n\nprovisions   did    not   apply   to   Santiago.   Santiago   only   had\n\ninformation on the flight's altitude above sea level; he had no\n\ninformation about the elevation of the surrounding terrain, the\n\naircraft's altitude over the ground, or its proximity to any\n\nterrain or obstacles (aside from its distance from the tower on El\n\nYunque). When the flight disappeared from Santiago's radar shortly\n\nbefore the crash, he had even less information about the flight.\n\nNor was there any indication from Wojciechowicz before then that he\n\nwas in distress.\n\n\n\n\n     15\n          We recognize but do not resolve the issue of whether this\ndiscretionary language triggers the discretionary function\nexception to the FTCA.

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203829\"><a href=\"/opinion/203829/fothergill-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 252 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n                                   -25-\n\f           Plaintiffs argue that Santiago should have known the\n\naircraft was in unsafe proximity to terrain because it was flying\n\ntoward El Yunque peak at an altitude below the peak's elevation.\n\nThe   district   court   made   a   finding   rejecting   this   argument.\n\nWojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 260.        There is no clear error in\n\nthe district court's conclusion that the information available to\n\nSantiago, who knew Wojciechowicz was operating under VFR procedures\n\nand who received no distress calls from the pilot, was insufficient\n\nto alert Santiago to the fact that Wojciechowicz had placed himself\n\nin a dangerous position.    See id. at 259-60.     A VFR pilot flying in\n\na sparsely populated area may fly close to the ground and below the\n\naltitude of surrounding terrain, so long as minimum visibility is\n\nmaintained. 14 C.F.R. §§ 91.119(c), 91.155(a); see Biles, 848 F.2d\n\nat 663.\n\nC.         Plaintiffs' Claim under Courses 55060 and 55065 of the\n           Air Traffic Technical Training Order\n\n           Plaintiffs' arguments related to alleged deficiencies in\n\nSantiago's training fail for similar reasons.16       Essentially, they\n\nargue that certain FAA training guidelines have the force of law\n\nand that CERAP's failure to follow the training led to Santiago\n\nbeing unfamiliar with the terrain and obstructions in his area of\n\nresponsibility and that because of his unfamiliarity, he did not\n\n\n\n      16\n          We do not reach plaintiffs' argument that the district\ncourt erred in holding that CERAP had leeway to depart from the\nFAA's national training directives.\n\n                                    -26-\n\frecognize the danger of Wojciechowicz's situation. They argue this\n\nled Santiago to fail to issue a safety alert as required under ATCM\n\n¶ 2-1-6.17\n\n             The district court accepted Santiago's testimony that he\n\nwas familiar with the location of El Yunque and the mountains but\n\nnot with every peak and valley.        The court also found that even if\n\nSantiago     had   been   aware   of   the   high   terrain     over    which\n\nWojciechowicz was flying, he would not have been aware that the\n\naircraft was in unsafe proximity to the terrain because of the lack\n\nof terrain information on his radar scope, the fact that he only\n\nknew the aircraft's elevation above sea level rather than its\n\nelevation above the ground, and the fact that he had no reason not\n\nto   presume   that   Wojciechowicz    was   complying   with   VFR    flight\n\nprocedures.     Wojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 259-60.         The court\n\nalso found that general terrain knowledge would not have led\n\nSantiago to be aware that the flight was in unsafe proximity to\n\nterrain and that a safety alert was therefore required.                Id. at\n\n262.\n\n\n\n\n       17\n           Plaintiffs' argument that ¶ 2-1-6 required Santiago to\nissue a safety alert is distinct from an argument they made to the\ndistrict court that Santiago was under a duty to issue a safety\nadvisory because of the presence of high terrain in the area. See\nWojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 266-67.       Plaintiffs give no\ncitation to support the notion that there is a free-standing\nobligation to issue a safety advisory. The district court rejected\nthe latter argument and plaintiffs have not challenged this holding\non appeal.\n\n                                   -27-\n\f           The bottom line is that there was no clear error in the\n\ncourt's finding that the purported lack of training plaintiffs rely\n\non did not cause Santiago's inaction.            In the end, the district\n\ncourt   found   that   there   was   no     foreseeability   and   no   causal\n\nrelationship between any breach by Santiago and the plaintiffs'\n\ninjury.   These may be mixed questions of fact and law, but they are\n\ncomponents of negligence, so our review is for clear error.               See\n\nFed. Express Corp., 664 F.2d at 835.             There was no clear error\n\nhere.\n\n           Plaintiffs' only argument that the court clearly erred\n\nis, again, that because the aircraft was flying toward El Yunque at\n\nan altitude lower than the elevation of the peak, Santiago should\n\nhave known the aircraft was in unsafe proximity to the terrain.\n\nFor the reasons stated earlier, this argument fails.\n\nD.         Conclusion\n\n           Given the evidence and our standard of review in this\n\nfact based case, we find no reversible error.\n\n           The district court's judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                   -Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\f               LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting.            There is no question\n\nthat the pilot bears primary responsibility for the tragic accident\n\nat issue here.       Nevertheless, that is only part of the story.           This\n\ncase raises important questions about the scope of an air traffic\n\ncontroller's duty of care to a plane flown under visual flight\n\nrules (\"VFR\") after radar contact initiated by the pilot is then\n\nlost.    The majority accepts the district court's finding that any\n\npossible breach of duty by the controller did not contribute to the\n\ncrash.     I do not agree.            If a controller's duty to separate\n\naircraft from terrain continues after radar contact is lost, we\n\ncould not conclude that the controller's conduct had no effect on\n\nthe accident.           I believe that Santiago did have such a duty and\n\nthat,     on     this     record,    he   was    required    to   attempt   radio\n\ncommunication with the airplane in time to separate it from El\n\nYunque.        Because the record shows that, if Santiago had done so,\n\nthe plane crash might have been prevented, I cannot conclude that\n\nSantiago's breach of duty did not contribute to the accident.                   I\n\ntherefore respectfully dissent.\n\n                                           I.\n\n               Paragraph     5-5-9   of    the   Air   Traffic    Control   Manual\n\n(\"ATCM\") requires air traffic controllers to “separate aircraft\n\nfrom prominent obstructions depicted on the radar scope,” and\n\nspecifies a minimum separation distance of three miles for aircraft\n\n\n\n\n                                          -29-\n\flike the one flown by Wojciechowicz.18 The district court held that\n\nthis provision applies only to flights operating under instrument\n\nflight rules (\"IFR\") and further concluded that, even if VFR\n\nflights were within the scope of ¶ 5-5-9, Santiago did not violate\n\nthe provision because Wojciechowicz's plane was off radar by the\n\ntime the three-mile limit was reached.          The majority assumes for\n\nthe sake of efficient analysis that ¶ 5-5-9 applies to VFR flights,\n\nand it holds that the district court did not commit clear error in\n\nfinding no breach of duty because, even though radar contact with\n\nWojciechowicz's plane was lost, the controller could reasonably\n\nrely on the pilot to see and avoid terrain and obstacles.\n\n           I do not understand how the majority can reach that\n\nconclusion.     If ¶ 5-5-9 applies to VFR flights, it can only be\n\nconstrued to impose a legal obligation on controllers to take all\n\nreasonable steps to separate aircraft from obstructions without\n\nregard to the VFR pilot's separate duty to prevent accidents.             As\n\nplaintiffs argue, the very point of applying ¶ 5-5-9 to VFR\n\naircraft   is   to   provide   a   second   layer   of   protection   against\n\naccidents like the one that occurred in this case.          It is precisely\n\n\n\n     18\n        Paragraph 5-5-9, which is titled                  \"Separation   from\nObstructions,\" states in relevant part:\n\n     [S]eparate aircraft from prominent obstructions depicted\n     on the radar scope . . . by the following minima:\n     1. When less than 40 miles from the antenna – 3 miles.\n\nATCM ¶ 5-5-9.\n\n                                     -30-\n\fin cases of unforeseeable pilot negligence that ¶ 5-5-9 would play\n\nits most critical role for VFR flights.        It thus makes no sense to\n\nsay that the provision imposes a duty whose outer limit is reached\n\nwhen the controller reasonably could rely on the pilot's own duty\n\nof care.    Such a conclusion defines the concurrent duty of the\n\ncontroller out of existence.\n\n            To resolve this case, therefore, we cannot avoid directly\n\naddressing two legal questions: (1) whether ¶ 5-5-9 applies to VFR\n\naircraft, and, if so, (2) the scope of the controller's duty under\n\nthat provision.     I consider each of those in turn.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            Notwithstanding its assumption that ¶ 5-5-9 applies to\n\nVFR flights, the majority discusses the nature of that provision at\n\nsome length and appears to conclude that the classic rules of\n\nstatutory interpretation do not apply to it.            It points out that\n\nthe ATCM is neither a statute nor a regulation, but only an\n\ninternal FAA guideline that does \"not have the force of law.\"             It\n\neffectively treats the provision's scope as a question of fact by\n\nendorsing the district court's reliance on the government's expert,\n\nEdward Henderson, who testified that ¶ 5-5-9 could not apply once\n\nWojciechowicz's plane disappeared from the radar screen. Henderson\n\nalso testified that he had never seen ¶ 5-5-9 used for VFR\n\naircraft,   which   led   the   district   court   to   conclude   that   the\n\nprovision does not apply to VFR flights.\n\n\n                                   -31-\n\f           Paragraph   5-5-9,   however,      constitutes    more     than\n\nbackground guidance or advisory criteria whose applicability is\n\nleft to the controller's discretion.          Although this court has\n\nacknowledged the difficulty of distinguishing between law and\n\npractice – particularly where informal documents such as guidelines\n\nand handbooks are involved, see Nieves-Villanueva v.

Although it is conceivable that VFR flights by\n\ndefinition would fall outside provisions requiring controllers to\n\nseparate   aircraft    from   obstructions   displayed       on   their     radar\n\nscopes, the next ¶ of the ATCM belies any such notion.                Paragraph\n\n5-5-10 addresses separation distances from \"adjacent airspace\" in\n\nwhich radar separation is also being used, and it excludes certain\n\nVFR aircraft from its dictates.       See ATCM, FAA Order 7110.65M § 5-\n\n5-10 (c) (“The provisions of subpara[graph]s a and b do not apply\n\nto   VFR   aircraft   being   provided     Class    B,   Class    C    or   TRSA\n\nservices.”).21     This   attention   to   VFR     flights   reinforces      the\n\n\n      21\n       Like ¶ 5-5-9, ¶ 5-5-10 specifies the separation distance\nthat controllers must maintain depending on the distance between\nthe aircraft and the radar antenna, or sensor, that is being used\nby the controller.

Controllers and pilots have a concurrent duty to\n\nmaintain safety, see, e.g., Delta Air Lines, 561 F.2d at 392\n\n(\"[A]lthough pilots are undoubtedly responsible for the safety of\n\ntheir        aircraft,    controllers    are     concurrently     responsible   for\n\nadhering to procedures which minimize the difficulties for the\n\n\n\n\ncontrol of another air traffic control facility.\n        22\n        The majority notes that the FAA-published Aeronautical\nInformation Manual (\"AIM\") expressly states that separation\nservices are not provided to VFR aircraft in Class E airspace. The\ndistrict court found that Wojciechowicz's plane entered Class G\nairspace one minute before the collision and flew in and out of\nClass G from that time until the crash, including \"at least the 10\nseconds prior to colliding with the terrain.\" Wojciechowicz, 576\nF.

Section 5-5-1(e) of the AIM states:\n\n          The   responsibilities   of  the   pilot   and\n          controller intentionally overlap in many areas\n          providing a degree of redundancy. Should one\n          or the other fail in any manner, this\n          overlapping responsibility is expected to\n          compensate, in many cases, for failures that\n          may affect safety.\n\n          Imposing    the   duty    to    separate    under     ¶   5-5-9    on\n\ncontrollers for all flights receiving basic radar services is one\n\nobvious method to protect against unexpected \"failures that may\n\naffect safety.\"      Hence, I can only conclude that the plain,\n\nunlimited language of ¶ 5-5-9 governs and that the provision\n\napplies to VFR as well as IFR flights.          I therefore must consider\n\nthe scope of the duty imposed by the provision and whether it was\n\nbreached in the circumstances of this case.\n\n                                   III.\n\n          The   majority    explains     why   the   district   court   could\n\nproperly find that Santiago did not act unreasonably in failing to\n\ncontact Wojciechowicz before the plane disappeared from radar, when\n\nit was still approximately 4.7 miles from El Yunque.            Paragraph 5-\n\n5-9 prescribes a mandatory minimum of three miles, and the record\n\nshows that Wojciechowicz still had plenty of time at the 4.7-mile\n\npoint to change course and avoid crashing into the mountain.                The\n\nmajority errs, however, in deferring to the district court's\n\nconclusion that Santiago's duty ended when radar contact was lost.\n\n\n                                   -36-\n\fNothing in ¶ 5-5-9 suggests that the duty to separate aircraft from\n\nobstructions automatically dissolves when a plane receiving radar\n\nservices suddenly disappears from the screen. Indeed, no one would\n\nsuggest that the loss of radar contact with a flight operating\n\nunder instrument rules terminates the controller's duty to provide\n\nseparation services.\n\n          The majority holds that, in the absence of \"mandatory\n\nlanguage stating when a controller must take action to attempt to\n\nmaintain a separation,\" the district court permissibly treated the\n\nquestion of duty \"as one of what a reasonable controller would have\n\ndone on these particular facts.\"           I have no problem with the\n\nmajority's statement of the general principle.23         The majority goes\n\non to conclude, however, that the district court committed no clear\n\nerror in finding that it was reasonable for the controller to\n\nassume that the VFR pilot knew where he was and could see the\n\nmountain, and, on that basis, acted reasonably in failing to\n\nimmediately   initiate   contact    with   the   pilot    when   the   plane\n\ndisappeared from radar.\n\n\n     23\n        The majority asserts that I have improperly treated the\nquestion of the reasonableness of the controller's actions under ¶\n5-5-9 as one of law rather than fact.       This misrepresents my\nanalysis, which is consistent with our decision in Federal Express\nCorp., 664 F.2d at 835. We held there that \"[t]he existence and\nextent of a duty of care are questions of law; whether any such\nduty has been breached and whether proximate cause exists are\nquestions for the factfinder, whose determination is binding on\nappeal unless clearly erroneous.\"      Id.  My analysis considers\n\"[t]he existence and extent\" of the controller's duty under ¶ 5-5-9\nas a question of law and the issue of breach as a factual question.\n\n                                   -37-\n\f          As I have explained, ¶ 5-5-9 has no purpose in the VFR\n\ncontext unless it is to serve as backup protection against the\n\npossibility of pilot negligence.    In imposing a concurrent duty on\n\ncontrollers to separate VFR flights from obstructions, ¶ 5-5-9\n\neffectively incorporates an assumption that pilot negligence is\n\nforeseeable.   The fact that Wojciechowicz, as a VFR pilot, should\n\nhave been aware of his surroundings is thus besides the point, and\n\nthe controller's duty under ¶ 5-5-9 is no different for VFR flights\n\nthan for IFR flights.   If a plane is no longer visible on the radar\n\nscreen, the only way for the controller to be sure there is proper\n\nseparation between that aircraft and prominent obstructions is to\n\ncontact the pilot directly.    From that perspective, it is apparent\n\nthat Santiago's duty under ¶ 5-5-9 could not automatically end with\n\nthe loss of radar contact.    Rather, as with an IFR flight, the duty\n\nto maintain separation required him to make reasonable efforts to\n\ncontact Wojciechowicz to ensure that the aircraft remained three\n\nmiles away from El Yunque.    It was foreseeable that, in the event\n\nof pilot negligence, Santiago's failure to take that step could be\n\ndisastrous.\n\n          Santiago’s own actions and testimony indicate that he was\n\naware of his responsibility to attempt to contact Wojciechowicz.\n\nAlthough Santiago testified that short-term loss of radar contact\n\nwith an aircraft is not unusual, he acknowledged that if an\n\naircraft disappears from his scope, he would, “most frankly,”\n\n\n                                 -38-\n\finform that aircraft that radar contact was lost.            He explained\n\nthat he does not necessarily inform a pilot that radar contact is\n\nlost when the plane's data is in \"coast\" mode – the short period\n\nimmediately after the loss of radar contact when the computer\n\npredicts the flight's likely path – because planes sometimes will\n\n\"go into coast . . . and then they'll come back.\"              The flight\n\ntranscript shows that Santiago attempted to reach Wojciechowicz's\n\nplane by radio more than a dozen times, starting at 43 seconds\n\nafter the plane's coast data disappeared from the radar scope\n\n(roughly the time of the crash).24\n\n            The district court's view that Santiago's duty under ¶ 5-\n\n5-9 ended when the plane was no longer visible on radar is thus\n\nunsupportable.     That legal error infected the district court's\n\nfact-finding     and   undermines   the    majority's   reliance   on     it.\n\nExamining the record in light of the proper scope of ¶ 5-5-9, the\n\nremaining   question    is   whether   Santiago   breached   his   duty    to\n\nmaintain separation by failing to contact the pilot for 43 seconds\n\nafter all radar information about the flight ended.          I now turn to\n\nthat question.\n\n\n\n\n     24\n       The district court found that the plane crashed about two\nseconds later, \"approximately 45 seconds\" after the last coast data\nappeared. Wojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 259.\n\n                                    -39-\n\f                                   IV.\n\n             In one sense, it is undisputed that Santiago failed to\n\nperform his duty to ensure three miles of separation between the\n\nplane and prominent obstructions.          The aircraft was permitted to\n\npenetrate the three-mile “ring” around El Yunque and crashed 1.43\n\nmiles from the mountain’s peak.     Wojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n246.   The majority is correct, however, that simple breach of the\n\nduty does not amount to negligence, and the issue before us turns\n\non   \"what   a   reasonable   controller    would   have   done   on   these\n\nparticular facts\" to fulfill his duty under ¶ 5-5-9.         Santiago did\n\nattempt to contact the pilot.      Hence, the specific question to be\n\naddressed is whether his delay in doing so was reasonable.\n\n             The record shows that a reasonable factfinder would have\n\nto conclude that it was not.      Santiago knew or should have known,\n\nbased on the information displayed on his scope, that at the moment\n\nactual radar contact was lost, the airplane was only 1.7 miles away\n\nfrom the three-mile ring – the minimum distance for separation\n\nspecified in ¶ 5-5-9.     See Wojciechowicz, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 259.\n\nHe also knew that the plane was headed toward the mountain.            Even\n\nif a three-mile separation was no longer feasible, Santiago at\n\nleast needed to take all reasonable steps to contact Wojciechowicz\n\nearly enough to guide the plane away from the mountain in case the\n\npilot inexplicably failed to change direction on his own.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -40-\n\f           The government's expert testified that Wojciechowicz\n\ncould have maneuvered the plane away from the accident site within\n\n17 or 18 seconds.     The last coast data appeared on radar at about\n\n45 seconds before the crash.       Id.    Accepting the end of all data as\n\na   reasonable    trigger   for   the    controller's   concern,     and   even\n\nallowing for a brief delay as Santiago came to the realization that\n\nthe plane had not reappeared on the radar scope, Santiago still had\n\nmore than thirty seconds to attempt to turn the aircraft before the\n\nimpact occurred – nearly double the time needed.                    He waited,\n\nhowever, until virtually the time of impact to initiate radio\n\ncontact.     On    this     record,     that   delay   can   only    be    found\n\nunreasonable.25     I realize that thirty seconds is not much time.\n\n\n      25\n       The majority states        that reliance on a duty to separate\nwithin thirty seconds after       the coast data disappeared introduces\na new theory to the case.         That is not so. Plaintiffs make the\nfollowing argument in their       brief:\n\n      [T]he district court's finding that \"[t]he last 'coast'\n      data block on the Aircraft was seen at 2:21:42 p.m.,\n      approximately 45 seconds prior to the crash,\" also\n      undercuts the court's conclusion that it would have been\n      impossible for Santiago to have complied with § 5-5-\n      9. . . . Based upon any reasonable view of the evidence,\n      Controller Santiago had sufficient information and time\n      to issue a separation instruction to the Aircraft, as\n      required by § 5-5-9. This analysis is also consistent\n      with the testimony of the government's piloting expert\n      who testified that Mr. Wojciechowicz, the pilot, could\n      have climbed the Aircraft out of its predicament at a\n      point as late as 17 or 18 seconds prior to impact.\n\nAlthough the plaintiffs' timing discussion focused primarily on the\ncontention that Santiago needed to contact the plane before it\nreached the three-mile minimum distance from obstructions, the\nunderlying theory is the same whether the focus is the three-mile\n\n                                      -41-\n\fIn the business of air traffic control, however, split seconds\n\nmatter, and the stakes are enormous. If Santiago had fulfilled his\n\nduty under ¶ 5-5-9 of the ATCM – to \"separate [the] aircraft from\n\n[the] prominent obstruction[] depicted on the radar scope\" – this\n\naccident may have been avoided.26\n\n                The majority observes in a footnote that there was no\n\nevidence presented that Santiago could have reached the plane by\n\nradio if he had tried earlier.               To the contrary, Santiago and\n\nWojciechowicz had been communicating by radio, showing that the\n\nradio was functioning properly.             There is no basis for concluding\n\nthat the radio would have suddenly failed before the plane crashed.\n\n                Nor is there any reason to think that Santiago could not\n\nhave guided the change of course within the 17 or 18 seconds the\n\nexpert estimated would ordinarily be necessary.               The record shows\n\nthat,        despite   the   lack   of   radar   contact,   Santiago   had   some\n\nawareness of the airplane’s location. After the crash, he directed\n\n\nminimum or separation from the mountain itself                   –   i.e.,   that\nSantiago had a duty to act before it was too late.\n        26\n         I do not suggest that the government bore full, or even\nsubstantial, responsibility for the crash. Under Puerto Rico law,\nwhere the relative fault of the plaintiff and defendant is taken\ninto account, a factfinder properly could have concluded that the\ngovernment was responsible for only a small percentage of the\ndamages. See, e.g., Campos Viuda de Courtois, 778 F. Supp. at 590\n(\"[I]f both the plaintiff and defendant are at fault, the plaintiff\ncan still recover, but his recovery is limited to the proportion of\ndamages sustained by the plaintiff that were proximately caused by\nthe defendant's negligence.\"); P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5141\n(\"Concurrent imprudence of the party aggrieved does not exempt from\nliability, but entails a reduction of the indemnity.\").\n\n                                         -42-\n\fnumerous planes and police helicopters directly to the crash site,\n\nat one point stating that “once you get close to the area I’ll give\n\nyou a point out.”           Therefore, regardless of the pilot’s own\n\ndisorientation, Santiago had sufficient knowledge of the plane’s\n\nwhereabouts to accomplish the required separation.\n\n                                         V.\n\n            The tragic result in this case might have been avoided if\n\nthe government had performed its duty under ¶ 5-5-9 to maintain a\n\nthree-mile separation between Wojciechowicz's plane and El Yunque.\n\nThe plain language of the provision extends the duty                to separate\n\naircraft from obstructions to IFR and VFR flights alike, and that\n\nduty does not terminate when radar contact is lost unexpectedly.\n\nIndeed, even under VFR conditions, the unexplained loss of all\n\nradar   contact     when    a   plane    is    heading   directly    toward   an\n\nobstruction   and    nearing     the    three-mile     safety   barrier   should\n\ntrigger the controller's immediate concern.               To fulfill his duty\n\nunder ¶ 5-5-9, the controller had to act quickly to contact\n\nWojciechowicz so that, if necessary, he could guide the pilot in\n\nseparating the plane from El Yunque.             In the circumstances here,\n\nSantiago's 43-second delay before attempting such contact was\n\nunreasonable.\n\n            In concluding that the district court committed no clear\n\nerror in evaluating the facts, the majority misconstrues the law\n\nand   the   principle      of   concurrent     duty.     The    government    has\n\n\n                                        -43-\n\fundertaken to act as a safeguard to potential pilot negligence, and\n\nwhen it performs that function negligently, its actions cannot be\n\ninsulated from review because of the pilot's errors.           Sadly, it\n\ntakes only a few seconds of inattention on the part of an air\n\ntraffic controller for tragedy to strike.         I would reverse and\n\nremand   with   instructions   that   the   district   court   apportion\n\nresponsibility for the tragedy between the pilot and the controller\n\nunder Puerto Rico's tort law.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -44-\n\f</pre>",
