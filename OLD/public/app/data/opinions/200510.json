Louison and Merrick,\nLouison & Costello were on brief for appellees William J. Wallace\nand Town of Andover.\n\n\n                          June 16, 2003\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge. The issue on this appeal is whether\n\nin January 2000, the police in Andover, Massachusetts, had probable\n\ncause to arrest Barbara Valente for planting anonymous bomb threats\n\nin her place of work.\n\n            In August 1997, Valente began work as an on-site manager\n\nfor ADECCO Employment Services (\"ADECCO\"), then known as TAD, at a\n\nHewlett-Packard (\"HP\") plant in Andover, Massachusetts.                The HP\n\nplant was a large one, comprising seven buildings and employing\n\nover 2,500 people.        Between August 1997 and January 1999, seven\n\nanonymous bomb threats and fourteen anonymous notes expressing\n\nspite or workplace dissatisfaction appeared at the plant.              By way\n\nof example, one bomb threat read:\n\n            There is a bomb planted in building 2. To get\n            you and to get Sheila and to get anyone who\n            keeps us here on a dangerous day. It will go\n            off when I leave at two! Goodbye to you.\n\n            Several      of   the   notes   were   found    by   Valente--one\n\npurportedly signed with her first name--and twenty-one of the\n\ntwenty-four notes were in the building in which she worked.             After\n\nthe first bomb threat in November 1997, the Andover police began an\n\ninvestigation.     The detective then heading the case identified a\n\nsuspect (not Valente) by handwriting, and HP retained a handwriting\n\nanalysis firm with adequate credentials: McCann and Associates.\n\nMcCann    deemed   the    samples   inconclusive   and     the   investigation\n\nlapsed.\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f              In    September    1998,    Valente     began     three    months   of\n\nmaternity leave to care for her newly adopted child.                    During this\n\ntime, two more notes were discovered and in January 1999, the\n\ninvestigation       resumed     under    the   charge   of    Detective       William\n\nWallace.      More handwriting samples were obtained, this time from\n\nnine employees including Valente.              McCann determined that for the\n\nfourteen notes as to which it could draw conclusions, only Valente\n\ncould not be ruled out as a suspect; but McCann also said that she\n\ncould   not    be    \"conclusively\"      identified     based    on     the   samples\n\navailable.\n\n              More samples of Valente's handwriting were secured and in\n\nNovember 1999, McCann concluded that it was \"more probable than\n\nnot\" that Valente was the author of three bomb notes, including two\n\nfound when she was on leave, and eleven of the other notes.\n\nWallace met with McCann representatives who, with slides or similar\n\nmeans, displayed the similarities on which they relied and repeated\n\ntheir conclusion.       Wallace also determined that Valente could have\n\nvisited the HP building in question during her leave, although he\n\nhad no proof that she had done so.\n\n              On January 5, 2000, at Wallace's request Valente came to\n\nthe police department.          In the discussion that followed, Wallace\n\ndeemed Valente's rather terse disclaimers not what he expected from\n\nan innocent person--she simply said she knew nothing about the\n\nnotes; he also found her to be very nervous, her skin reddening and\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fbreaking out in hives.     At the close of the interview, Wallace and\n\nhis supervisor    agreed   that    Valente   should   be   arrested    and   a\n\nwarrantless arrest was effected on three counts of creating a bomb\n\nscare, each of which carried a maximum punishment of 20 years'\n\nimprisonment under Massachusetts law.        Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 269, ยง\n\n14(b)(1), (c) (2002).\n\n          Valente was never prosecuted.        A criminal complaint was\n\ndismissed when the prosecutor failed to meet a discovery deadline.\n\nDuring the period after her arrest and when Valente was not working\n\nat the plant, yet another note was found and suspicion fell on\n\nanother employee.   In July 2001, Valente brought the present civil\n\nrights action against Wallace, his supervisor and the town, 42\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1983 (2000), charging that she had been arrested without\n\nprobable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment.1\n\n          After   discovery,      the   district   court   granted    summary\n\njudgment on the merits in favor of the police, ruling from the\n\nbench that they had probable cause for the arrest, a ground that\n\nalso disposed of any derivative claim against the town.               In the\n\nalternative, the district court found that the two individual\n\nofficers were entitled to qualified immunity. Valente now appeals.\n\nOur review on summary judgment is de novo.             See Roche v. John\n\nHancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 81 F.3d 249, 253 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n\n     1\n      State law claims against the police were also asserted and HP\nand ADECCO were named as defendants on a civil conspiracy theory\nbut none of these claims is pursued in this court.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f                 For a warrantless arrest, the Fourth Amendment is taken\n\nto require \"probable cause,\" Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S.\n\n471,       479   (1963),    and   the   broad   outlines    of   the   concept   are\n\nfamiliar.         See generally, 2 LaFave, Search and Seizure ch. 3 (3d\n\ned. 1996). But the case law on probable cause harbors one central\n\nambiguity and a host of smaller issues.                    The ambiguity exists\n\nbecause the Supreme Court has told us that probable cause means\n\nmore than \"bare suspicion\" but less that what would be needed to\n\n\"justify . . . conviction.\"             Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S.\n\n160, 175 (1949).           A good deal of territory lies in between.\n\n                 Within this territory, the Supreme Court has said that\n\nthe question is whether the evidence would \"warrant a man of\n\nreasonable caution\" in believing that a crime has been committed\n\nand committed by the person to be arrested.                Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S.\n\n89, 96 (1964).         See United States v. Reyes, 225 F.3d 71, 75 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).         The emphasis is on calculating likelihoods.              E.g.,\n\nBrinegar, 338 U.S. at 175. Whether this excludes all other factors\n\nand whether the likelihood must be \"more likely than not\" are\n\nquestions arguably unsettled;2 but, centrally, the mercurial phrase\n\n\"probable cause\" means a reasonable likelihood. Illinois v. Gates,\n\n462 U.S. 213, 235 (1983).\n\n\n       2\n      The conflicting Supreme Court case law on both points is\nchronicled in detail in LaFave, supra at ยง 3.2(e). On the latter\nissue, the Court in Gates has suggested that the question may not\nbe all that useful, presumably because the odds can rarely be\ndetermined with such precision. Gates, 462 U.S. at 235.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f           In our case, the bomb threats constituted a crime so the\n\nonly question is whether the police had probable cause to believe\n\nthat Valente was the culprit.          The test is objective and turns on\n\nwhat a reasonable police officer would conclude based on the\n\nevidence actually available at the time (and not on unknown facts\n\nor subsequent events).         Roche, 81 F.3d at 254.         On the facts known\n\nto Wallace at the time, we hold that a reasonable police officer\n\nwould be warranted in the belief that Valente had sent some of the\n\nnotes.\n\n           The main reason for this conclusion is that a seemingly\n\nqualified expert handwriting examiner had said that the notes were\n\nmore likely than not written by Valente.             This is not conclusive as\n\nto probable cause (for reasons to which we will return) but it is\n\na   powerful    start.          Cf.    Roche,   81     F.3d    at   255   (voice\n\nidentification).      And it is worth noting that Wallace did not just\n\ntake the expert's summary conclusion; he met with the McCann\n\nrepresentatives and watched them explain graphically why they were\n\npersuaded.\n\n           If Valente's fingerprints had been found inside a threat\n\nletter first opened by the police, it could hardly be doubted that\n\nprobable cause       would    exist.     Handwriting     analysis    is   a   less\n\nrigorous     means    of     identification,    e.g.,     Mnookin,    Scripting\n\nExpertise, 87 Va. L. Rev. 1723, 1726-27 (2001), depending inter\n\nalia on how distinctive the handwriting might be, the number and\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\ftype of samples, and the competence of the examiner.      See United\n\nStates v. Mooney, 315 F.3d 54, 62-63 (1st Cir. 2002).      Normally,\n\nthe examiner can do no more than speak of probabilities.    But here\n\nthe examiner did say, \"more likely than not,\" which is the most\n\nthat the Fourth Amendment requires.   See note 2 above.\n\n           This is not the end of the story.       Plenty of other\n\nevidence might be available to the police to reinforce--or to\n\nrebut--an expert's view that the suspect more likely than not wrote\n\na threat note.    Suppose the note contained information almost\n\ncertainly known only to the suspect or, conversely, information\n\nthat the suspect would be most unlikely to know.   Or there might be\n\ninformation about motive and access, two staples of criminal\n\ninvestigation.    The initial expert judgment might have to be\n\nadjusted; conceivably, \"probable cause\" could vanish based on new\n\ndata.\n\n           Here, the notes had begun not long after Valente joined\n\nthe company, and most were found in the building where she worked.\n\nSee United States v. Brown, 457 F.2d 731, 733 (1st Cir. 1972).   All\n\nof this is mildly helpful to Wallace, although how far depends in\n\npart on the size of the workforce, turnover, and similar data; some\n\nof the facts, and what the police knew on these points, are\n\nobscure.   The police do appear to have checked to see whether\n\nValente could have had access during her three-month leave and\n\nfound that this could not be ruled out.\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f          There is also Valente's behavior during the interview at\n\nthe police station.   According to Wallace, she was both unduly\n\ntaciturn (he said that the usual innocent person protests much more\n\nstrongly when wrongly accused) and extremely nervous.    Frankly, to\n\na layman, neither of these symptoms seems very revealing. However,\n\nthe case law does give some weight both to demeanor evidence, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. One Lot of U.S. Currency, 103 F.3d 1048, 1055 (1st\n\nCir. 1997), and to the experience of the police.        E.g., United\n\nStates v. Ortiz, 422 U.S. 891, 897 (1975). In fairness to Wallace,\n\nhe said that the interview was primarily to see if Valente could\n\ncounter the inference he had already drawn.\n\n          Thus, at the time of the arrest, the police had expert\n\nevidence that Valente was more probably than not the note writer;\n\nshe had apparent access to the site throughout the period before\n\nher arrest; most of the notes were discovered near or not far from\n\nwhere she worked; there was no specific motive attributable to her\n\nbut disgruntled employees are not unknown; and there was apparently\n\nno other then-current suspect against whom a strong case existed.\n\nThis, in our view, is probable cause for an arrest.   See Roche, 81\n\nF.3d at 254-55.\n\n          What has been said above largely disposes of Valente's\n\narguments on this appeal.   Her counsel claims that we should look\n\nonly at the McCann report because Wallace, in a deposition taken\n\ntwo and a half years after the arrest, said that this was the only\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fevidence of guilt and her nervousness was not mentioned in the\n\narrest report.       But Valente's access, proximity to the notes and\n\nnervousness at the interview were contemporaneous events known to\n\nthe police and doubtless considered by them even if not formally\n\ndesignated evidence of guilt.\n\n              Finally,    Valente    says    that    a   psychological    profile\n\ncommissioned by HP allegedly suggested that the culprit had traits\n\nthat differed from Valente's.             However, while handwriting is an\n\ninexact science, psychological profiling appears to be even more\n\ninexact; handwriting experts have been routinely used in courts for\n\na century now,           Mnookin, supra, at 1726, while psychological\n\nprofiling remains primarily a law enforcement device for narrowing\n\nthe   field    of   suspects   and   is     rarely   admissible   in     court.   1\n\nGiannelli & Imwinkelried, Scientific Evidence ยง9.7 at 479 (3d ed.\n\n1999).    If the profile counts at all in the                   probable cause\n\ncalculus, it does not alter the result in this case.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f",

The HP plant was a large one, comprising seven buildings and employing over 2,500 people.

All of this is mildly helpful to Wallace, although how far depends in part on the size of the work-force, turnover, and similar data; some of the facts, and what the police knew on these points, are obscure.

According to Wallace, she was both unduly taciturn (he said that the usual innocent person protests much more strongly when wrongly accused) and extremely nervous. Frankly, to a layman, neither of these symptoms seems very revealing. However, the case law does give some weight both to demeanor evidence, <i>e.g., United States v. One Lot of U.S. Currency,</i> 103 F.3d 1048, 1055 (1st Cir.1997), and to the experience of the police. <i>E.g., United States v. Ortiz,</i> 422 U.S. 891, 897, 95 S.Ct. 2585, 45 L.Ed.2d 623 (1975).

This, in our view, is probable cause for an arrest. <i>See Roche,</i> 81 F.3d at 254-55.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What has been said above largely disposes of Valente's arguments on this appeal.

The HP plant was a large one, comprising seven buildings and employing over 2,500 people. Between August 1997 and January 1999, seven anonymous bomb threats and fourteen anonymous notes expressing spite or workplace dissatisfaction appeared at the plant. By way of example, one bomb threat read:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a bomb planted in building 2. To get you and to get Sheila and to get anyone who keeps us here on a dangerous day. It will go off when I leave at two! Goodbye to you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several of the notes were found by Valente &#8212; one purportedly signed with her first name &#8212; and twenty-one of the twenty-four notes were in the building in which she worked. After the first bomb threat in November 1997, the Andover police began an investigation. The detective then heading the case identified a suspect (not Valente) by handwriting, and HP retained a handwriting analysis firm with adequate credentials: McCann and Associates. McCann deemed the samples inconclusive and the investigation lapsed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1998, Valente began three months of maternity leave to care for her newly adopted child. During this time, two more notes were discovered and in January 1999, the investigation resumed under the charge of Detective William Wallace. More handwriting samples were obtained, this time from nine employees including Valente. McCann determined that for the fourteen notes as to which it could draw conclusions, only Valente could not be ruled out as a suspect; but McCann also said that she could not be \"conclusively\" identified based on the samples available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More samples of Valente's handwriting were secured and in November 1999, McCann concluded that it was \"more probable than not\" that Valente was the author of three bomb notes, including two found when she was on leave, and eleven of the other notes. Wallace met with McCann representatives who, with slides or similar means, displayed the similarities on which they relied and repeated their conclusion. Wallace also determined that Valente could have visited the HP building in question during her leave, although he had no proof that she had done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 5, 2000, at Wallace's request Valente came to the police department. In the discussion that followed, Wallace deemed Valente's rather terse disclaimers not what he expected from an innocent person &#8212; she simply said she knew nothing about the notes; he also found her to be very nervous, her skin reddening and breaking out in hives. At the close of the interview, Wallace and his supervisor agreed that Valente should be arrested and a warrantless arrest was effected on three counts of creating a bomb scare, each of which carried a maximum punishment of 20 years' imprisonment under Massachusetts law. Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 269, &#167; 14(b)(1), (c) (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valente was never prosecuted. A criminal complaint was dismissed when the prosecutor failed to meet a discovery deadline. During the period after her arrest and when Valente was not working at the plant, yet another note was found and suspicion fell on another employee. In July 2001, Valente brought the present civil rights action against Wallace, his supervisor and the town, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000), charging that she had been arrested without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discovery, the district court granted summary judgment on the merits in favor of the police, ruling from the bench that they had probable cause for the arrest, a ground that also disposed of any derivative claim against the town. In the alternative, the district court found that the two individual officers were entitled to qualified immunity. Valente now appeals. Our review on summary judgment is <i>de novo. See Roche v.

However, while handwriting is an inexact science, psychological profiling appears to be even more inexact; handwriting experts have been routinely used in courts for a century now, Mnookin, <i>supra,</i> at 1726, while psychological profiling remains primarily a law enforcement device for narrowing the field of suspects and is rarely admissible in court. 1 Giannelli &amp; Imwinkelried, <i>Scientific Evidence</i> &#167; 9.7 at 479 (3d ed.1999). If the profile counts at all in the probable cause calculus, it does not alter the result in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> State law claims against the police were also asserted and HP and ADECCO were named as defendants on a civil conspiracy theory but none of these claims is pursued in this court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The conflicting Supreme Court case law on both points is chronicled in detail in LaFave,<i>supra</i> at &#167; 3.2(e).
