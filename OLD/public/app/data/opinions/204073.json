Andrew Barker seeks review of\n\naction taken by the Transportation Safety Administration (“TSA”)\n\nallegedly in violation of its lawful authority.       Barker alleges\n\nthat his due process rights were violated by the TSA’s issuance of\n\na “warning notice” to him at the conclusion of its investigation\n\ninto whether he conveyed a false bomb threat in violation of 49\n\nU.S.C. § 46302.    He asserts that the TSA lacked legal authority to\n\nissue such a notice.     In the alternative, he argues that if the\n\nagency was within its authority to issue the warning notice, that\n\nit violated his due process rights by doing so without affording\n\nhim a full administrative hearing.        He seeks rescission of the\n\nwarning notice and an injunction preventing the TSA from issuing\n\nfuture warning notices in connection with actual, alleged, or\n\nsuspected violations of 49 U.S.C. § 46302. We conclude that Barker\n\nlacks standing to bring these claims and we dismiss the petition\n\nfor review.\n\n                             Background\n\n     On August 24, 2006, Andrew Barker was scheduled to travel from\n\nDetroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DMW) to New York’s\n\nLaGuardia Airport on Northwest Airlines flight 538 departing at\n\n7:19 p.m.     Barker had traveled the previous day from Atlanta to\n\nDetroit, on his way home to New York following a lengthy business\n\ntrip.   Barker arrived several hours early for his flight.        He\n\nchecked a single bag, received a boarding pass, and left the\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fairport to attend a meeting.               At approximately 7:25 p.m., Barker\n\narrived at the departure gate for his flight and a Northwest\n\nAirlines gate agent informed him that there was no longer a seat\n\navailable for him.           A dispute arose between the gate agent and\n\nBarker concerning whether he could still board the flight.                      Barker\n\neventually requested that his checked luggage be returned to him\n\nand he was instructed that it could not be removed from the plane\n\nand that he would have to wait for a supervisor to arrive.                  Several\n\nwitnesses then heard Barker make a reference to a bomb being in the\n\nbag, although witness statements varied as to the precise language\n\nused.         A   second   gate    agent   overheard     Barker’s     statement   and\n\ninstructed the first to contact the airport police.                     Barker then\n\nattempted to retract the statement.                  The gate agent contacted the\n\nDMW Airport Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also\n\ninformed.         Law enforcement officials arrived and Barker was taken\n\ninto custody.         A subsequent search of Barker’s luggage revealed\n\nthat it did not contain a bomb and no charges were filed.\n\n     On September 12, 2006, the TSA sent Barker a written “letter\n\nof investigation” informing him that it was investigating his\n\nalleged        violation   of     49   U.S.C.    §   463021   for   conveying    false\n\n\n        1\n            49 U.S.C. § 46302(a):\n                Civil Penalty.- A person that, knowing the\n                information to be false, gives, or causes to\n                be given, under circumstances in which the\n                information reasonably may be believed, false\n                information about an alleged attempt being\n                made or to be made to do an act that would\n\n                                           -3-\n\finformation and threats to Northwest Airlines personnel.                           The\n\nletter informed Barker that, as part of the TSA’s investigation, he\n\nwas being afforded an opportunity to “submit, in writing, any\n\ninformation regarding th[e] matter.” The following month, Barker’s\n\nattorney   submitted       a    letter    on    Barker’s     behalf     denying    the\n\nallegations       and   pointing    out    various     inconsistencies       in    the\n\nwitnesses’    statements.          In    November,     the     TSA   concluded     its\n\ninvestigation and the inspector assigned to the incident concluded\n\nthat Barker had violated 49 U.S.C. § 46302 by conveying false\n\ninformation of a bomb threat and recommended that he be given a\n\n$500 civil penalty. The agency did not follow that recommendation.\n\nInstead, ten months later, it issued a “warning notice” informing\n\nBarker that the investigation was complete and that a violation of\n\n§ 46302 “may have occurred.”              The warning notice set forth the\n\nlanguage     of    §    46302     and     concluded:     “At     this    time,     the\n\nTransportation      Safety      Administration     has     determined     that    this\n\nWarning Notice adequately addresses the incident.”\n\n     After receiving the warning notice, Barker’s attorney wrote a\n\nletter to the TSA arguing that the warning notice did not actually\n\n“provide any ‘warning’” to Barker and that therefore, its only\n\npurpose must have been to create a formal record against Barker\n\n\n\n           violate sections 46502(a), 46504, 46505, or\n           46506 of this title, is liable to the United\n           States Government for a civil penalty of not\n           more than $10,000 for each violation.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fthat could be used against him by the TSA in the future.                        The\n\nletter also    expressed concerns that the TSA had acted outside of\n\nits legal authority by issuing the notice.                     The TSA replied,\n\nassuring Barker that the warning notice was not a public record,\n\nwas not subject to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests,2 and\n\nthat it would not result in Barker’s placement on a “no-fly” list.\n\nThe TSA also stated that it had the authority to issue the warning\n\nnotice and that it would not repeal its decision to do so.\n\nThereafter, on November 13, 2007, Barker filed the present petition\n\nfor review in this Court, invoking jurisdiction under 49 U.S.C. §\n\n46110.\n\n                                 Discussion\n\n     Barker alleges that the TSA’s issuance of a warning notice to\n\nhim following its investigation into his alleged violation of 49\n\nU.S.C. § 46302 was outside the scope of the agency’s authority.\n\nBarker argues that the statute provides only for the issuance of a\n\ncivil penalty, not a warning notice, and that although the TSA has\n\nregulatory    authority    to    issue    a     warning   notice      for   alleged\n\nviolations    of   other   statutes       for    which    it   has    enforcement\n\nresponsibilities,    it    has    no     such    authority     with    regard    to\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Specifically, the TSA indicated that “If [it] received a\nrequest to release the warning notice under [FOIA] or otherwise,\nthe agency would excise all of Mr. Barker’s identifying information\non privacy grounds, so that document would not be attributable to\nhim.”\n\n                                       -5-\n\finvestigations under § 46302.3\n\n     In response to Barker’s petition, the TSA argues that Barker\n\nhas failed to allege any “cognizable legal or practical consequence\n\nflowing    from    the   TSA’s   issuance   of    the   Warning   Notice”   and\n\ntherefore this Court lacks jurisdiction over Barker’s claims.\n\nMore specifically, the TSA argues that this Court is without\n\njurisdiction “under either the rubric of Article III standing, or\n\nprinciples of administrative law that require an order to be\n\n‘final’ before it can be reviewed.”              The TSA also addresses the\n\nmerits, arguing that its issuance of a warning notice was within\n\nits lawful authority and comported with due process.\n\n     Because Article III standing is required for this Court to\n\nexercise jurisdiction, we must determine its presence at the\n\noutset.    See Donahue v. City of Boston, 304 F.3d 110, 117 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (“[T]his Court must resolve questions pertaining to its\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction before it may address the merits of a\n\ncase.”).    “The doctrine of constitutional standing reflects the\n\nfundamental       limitation     of   judicial     power   to     ‘Cases’   and\n\n‘Controversies,’ under Article III of the Constitution.”              Sutliffe\n\n\n\n     3\n      After oral argument in this case, the TSA revised its\nregulations.   See 74 Fed. Reg. 36,030 (July 21, 2009).         The\nregulations now provide that the TSA may issue a warning notice for\n“a violation or an alleged violation” of any “TSA requirement.”\nSee 49 C.F.R. § 1503.301(a). Although we decide this case on the\nbasis of standing, we note that this change in the TSA’s\nregulations would render moot Barker’s request to enjoin the TSA\nfrom issuing such warning notices in the future.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fv. Epping School Dist., 2009 WL 2973115, at * 8 (1st Cir. September\n\n17, 2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To have\n\nArticle III standing, a plaintiff must establish: \"(1) [he] has\n\nsuffered      an     ‘injury     in   fact'     that   is    (a)      concrete    and\n\nparticularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or\n\nhypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged\n\naction of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely\n\nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable\n\ndecision.\"     Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs.,\n\n528   U.S.    167,    180-81     (2000)     (quoting   Lujan     v.   Defenders    of\n\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-561 (1992)).                “The burden of stating\n\nfacts sufficient to support standing rests with the party seeking\n\nto assert federal jurisdiction.”              Sea Shore Corp. v. Sullivan, 158\n\nF.3d 51, 54 (1st Cir.1998).\n\n      Here, Barker has failed to allege any concrete actual or\n\nimminent injury.        As to actual injury, Barker argues that having\n\nreceived a letter that the TSA was unauthorized to send damaged his\n\n“liberty interests.”            Barker has not, however, identified what\n\n“liberty interests” are supposedly affected. Indeed, Barker admits\n\nthat the warning notice “does not request or require . . . Mr.\n\nBarker   to    take    any     corrective     action   or   to   comply   with    any\n\nregulatory matter under the TSA’s jurisdiction.”                      This nebulous\n\nargument is at best a claim of procedural error which does not\n\nexcuse the absence of an actual injury.                     “[D]eprivation of a\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fprocedural right without some concrete interest that is affected by\n\nthe deprivation – a procedural right in vacuo – is insufficient to\n\ncreate Article III standing.\" Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 129 S.\n\nCt. 1142, 1151 (2009).     Barker has failed to allege any actual,\n\nconcrete interest that was affected by issuance of the letter.\n\n       The other consequences Barker suggests may stem from the\n\nwarning notice have yet to occur and are anything but imminent.\n\nBarker argues that if he is ever the subject of another TSA\n\ninvestigation, the warning notice will be in his file and may be\n\nused   against   him.   Such   a   consequence,   however,   is   far   too\n\nspeculative to meet the “injury in fact” requirement of Article\n\nIII.   See Ctr. for Law and Educ. v. Dep’t of Educ., 396 F.3d 1152,\n\n1161 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (no standing where “[a]ppellants alleged\n\ndirect injury styled as ‘increased risk,’ in the form of giving the\n\nStates the opportunity to injure Appellants’ interests”); see also\n\nNational Counsel of La Raza v. Gonzales, 468 F.Supp.2d 429, 438-440\n\n(E.D.N.Y. 2007) (rejecting claim of “heightened risk” of future\n\narrest by placement of plaintiff’s immigration data into the NCIC\n\ndatabase as too speculative to constitute an injury in fact).\n\nFurther, should such a future investigation occur, Barker could\n\nassert due process claims in connection with those proceedings.\n\nBarker also alleges that reputational harm may result from the\n\nTSA’s decision to place the warning notice in Barker’s TSA file.\n\nHe has not, however, alleged that this confidential record has or\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fever will be accessed by the public.               In fact, Barker has received\n\nassurances from the TSA to the contrary and it is Barker, not the\n\nTSA, who made this matter public by filing this lawsuit.                    See id.\n\nat 444 (“The speculation that at some point in the future some\n\nunauthorized party may access plaintiffs' file in violation of a\n\nplaintiff members' privacy right does not satisfy the requirement\n\nthat plaintiffs identify an ‘actual or imminent,’ ‘concrete and\n\nparticularized’ injury.”).\n\n      We conclude that Barker lacks Article III standing because he\n\nhas   failed   to    allege     an   actual   or    imminent     injury    in   fact.\n\nAccordingly, this Court can not exercise jurisdiction over his\n\nclaims.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      For   the     foregoing    reasons,     the     Petition    for     Review   is\n\ndismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f",

The agency did not follow that recommendation.\n\nInstead, ten months later, it issued a “warning notice” informing\n\nBarker that the investigation was complete and that a violation of\n\n§ 46302 “may have occurred.”              The warning notice set forth the\n\nlanguage     of    §    46302     and     concluded:     “At     this    time,     the\n\nTransportation      Safety      Administration     has     determined     that    this\n\nWarning Notice adequately addresses the incident.”\n\n     After receiving the warning notice, Barker’s attorney wrote a\n\nletter to the TSA arguing that the warning notice did not actually\n\n“provide any ‘warning’” to Barker and that therefore, its only\n\npurpose must have been to create a formal record against Barker\n\n\n\n           violate sections 46502(a), 46504, 46505, or\n           46506 of this title, is liable to the United\n           States Government for a civil penalty of not\n           more than $10,000 for each violation.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fthat could be used against him by the TSA in the future.                        The\n\nletter also    expressed concerns that the TSA had acted outside of\n\nits legal authority by issuing the notice.                     The TSA replied,\n\nassuring Barker that the warning notice was not a public record,\n\nwas not subject to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests,2 and\n\nthat it would not result in Barker’s placement on a “no-fly” list.\n\nThe TSA also stated that it had the authority to issue the warning\n\nnotice and that it would not repeal its decision to do so.\n\nThereafter, on November 13, 2007, Barker filed the present petition\n\nfor review in this Court, invoking jurisdiction under 49 U.S.C. §\n\n46110.\n\n                                 Discussion\n\n     Barker alleges that the TSA’s issuance of a warning notice to\n\nhim following its investigation into his alleged violation of 49\n\nU.S.C. § 46302 was outside the scope of the agency’s authority.\n\nBarker argues that the statute provides only for the issuance of a\n\ncivil penalty, not a warning notice, and that although the TSA has\n\nregulatory    authority    to    issue    a     warning   notice      for   alleged\n\nviolations    of   other   statutes       for    which    it   has    enforcement\n\nresponsibilities,    it    has    no     such    authority     with    regard    to\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Specifically, the TSA indicated that “If [it] received a\nrequest to release the warning notice under [FOIA] or otherwise,\nthe agency would excise all of Mr. Barker’s identifying information\non privacy grounds, so that document would not be attributable to\nhim.”\n\n                                       -5-\n\finvestigations under § 46302.3\n\n     In response to Barker’s petition, the TSA argues that Barker\n\nhas failed to allege any “cognizable legal or practical consequence\n\nflowing    from    the   TSA’s   issuance   of    the   Warning   Notice”   and\n\ntherefore this Court lacks jurisdiction over Barker’s claims.\n\nMore specifically, the TSA argues that this Court is without\n\njurisdiction “under either the rubric of Article III standing, or\n\nprinciples of administrative law that require an order to be\n\n‘final’ before it can be reviewed.”              The TSA also addresses the\n\nmerits, arguing that its issuance of a warning notice was within\n\nits lawful authority and comported with due process.\n\n     Because Article III standing is required for this Court to\n\nexercise jurisdiction, we must determine its presence at the\n\noutset.

The\nregulations now provide that the TSA may issue a warning notice for\n“a violation or an alleged violation” of any “TSA requirement.”\nSee 49 C.F.R. § 1503.301(a).

As to actual injury, Barker argues that having\n\nreceived a letter that the TSA was unauthorized to send damaged his\n\n“liberty interests.”            Barker has not, however, identified what\n\n“liberty interests” are supposedly affected. Indeed, Barker admits\n\nthat the warning notice “does not request or require . . . Mr.\n\nBarker   to    take    any     corrective     action   or   to   comply   with    any\n\nregulatory matter under the TSA’s jurisdiction.”                      This nebulous\n\nargument is at best a claim of procedural error which does not\n\nexcuse the absence of an actual injury.                     “[D]eprivation of a\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fprocedural right without some concrete interest that is affected by\n\nthe deprivation – a procedural right in vacuo – is insufficient to\n\ncreate Article III standing.\" Summers v.

Barker has failed to allege any actual,\n\nconcrete interest that was affected by issuance of the letter.\n\n       The other consequences Barker suggests may stem from the\n\nwarning notice have yet to occur and are anything but imminent.\n\nBarker argues that if he is ever the subject of another TSA\n\ninvestigation, the warning notice will be in his file and may be\n\nused   against   him.   Such   a   consequence,   however,   is   far   too\n\nspeculative to meet the “injury in fact” requirement of Article\n\nIII.   See Ctr. for Law and Educ. v.
