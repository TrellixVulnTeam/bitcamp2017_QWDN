Elmore Thompson and Paula M.\n\nThompson appeal from the judgment of the district court requiring\nthem to   arbitrate   their    Truth    in   Lending     Act   claims   against\ndefendants Irwin Union Bank & Trust Company and Irwin Home Equity\n\nCorporation.     Seeing no reason why the claims should not be\narbitrated, we affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n           On August 29, 2000, the Thompsons obtained a mortgage\n\nloan of $11,000 from Irwin Union Bank & Trust Company at a\n\ndisclosed annual percentage rate of 15.9%.               The loan, which was\nassigned to Irwin Home Equity Corp. for servicing,1 was secured by\nthe Thompsons' home, and was not made in connection with the\n\ninitial acquisition    or     construction    of   the    home.     Hence   the\ntransaction was subject to the right of rescission provided by the\nTruth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. § 1635, which grants the\n\nborrower an unconditional right of rescission for the first three\ndays following the consummation of the transaction, along with a\nconditional right of rescission if the creditor fails to deliver\ncertain forms and to disclose certain information, including notice\nof the right to rescind itself.        The statute puts a three-year time\n\nlimit on the exercise of the conditional rescission right.                  Id.\n\n§ 1635(f).\n\n           On April 24, 2001, the Thompsons commenced this action in\n\nfederal district court, claiming that Irwin had violated TILA by\n\n\n\n     1\n         We refer to the two defendants as \"Irwin.\"\n\n                                   -2-\n\ffailing to notify them of their right to rescind, as required by 15\n\nU.S.C. § 1635(a).         The Thompsons take issue with Irwin's delivery\nof blank notices of the right to rescind               -- that is, generic forms\nwithout     the    pertinent       dates     filled    in       --     accompanied         by\n\n\"Instructions for Completing the Notice of Right to Cancel.\"                               In\ntheir    view,    this    \"do-it-yourself         disclosure         scheme\"       does    not\nconstitute       adequate    notice     of   the    right    to      rescind.         Their\ncomplaint seeks rescission of the loan agreement and damages.\n            In     June     of   2001   Irwin      filed    a     motion       to    compel\narbitration, pursuant to a provision in the loan agreement that\n\n\"[a]ny controversy or claim . . . arising out of or relating to\n\nthis Agreement . . . shall be determined by binding arbitration.\"\n\nIn October of 2001 the district court entered an order compelling\narbitration and dismissing the case.                  The Thompsons appeal from\n\nthat order.\n\n                                           II.\n\n            The Thompsons argue that the district court erred in\n\ncompelling       arbitration      because    they    had    rescinded         their       loan\nagreement    with    Irwin       pursuant    to    TILA,    15       U.S.C.    §    1635(a)\n\n(providing that borrower may rescind loan transaction by notifying\ncreditor of intention to do so).2                  In their view, \"[r]escission\n\npursuant to § 1635 is automatic, and results in the consumer having\n\n\n     2\n        In their brief to this court the Thompsons claim to have\nnotified Irwin a few weeks prior to the commencement of this\nlitigation of their purported rescission of the loan agreement.\nIrwin points out that the Thompsons do not allege this in their\ncomplaint, nor is there evidence in the record of such notice\nhaving been given.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fno further obligation to the lender.       Given the fact that the\n\nentire transaction was rescinded, the arbitration clause, which was\ncontained in the fine print of the rescinded contract, no longer\nexisted.\"\n\n            In Large v Conseco Finance Servicing Corp., 292 F.3d 49\n\n(1st Cir. 2002), on facts materially indistinguishable from the\nfacts here, we rejected the argument that a demand for rescission\nunder TILA is somehow self-executing and results in the automatic\nvoiding of the loan agreement.    We explained:\n            Neither the statute nor the regulation\n            establishes that a borrower's mere assertion\n            of the right of rescission has the automatic\n            effect of voiding the contract. . . . If a\n            lender disputes a borrower's purported right\n            to rescind, the designated decision maker --\n            here an arbitrator -- must decide whether the\n            conditions for rescission have been met.\n            Until such decision is made, the [borrower\n            has] only advanced a claim seeking rescission.\n            The agreement remains in force . . . .\n\nId. at 54-55. Large thus forecloses the Thompsons claim that their\n\ndemand for rescission had the automatic effect of invalidating the\n\nloan agreement.\n\n            As an alternative ground for avoiding arbitration, the\n\nThompsons point to the following language in the arbitration\n\nagreement:\n\n            Nothing contained in this Alternative Dispute\n            Resolution provision shall limit the right of\n            any party to this Agreement to exercise self-\n            help remedies such as setoff or to obtain\n            provisional or ancillary remedies from a court\n            of competent jurisdiction before, after, or\n            during the pendency of any arbitration or\n            other proceeding.   The exercise of a remedy\n            does not waive the right of either party to\n            resort to arbitration.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fThe Thompsons take the view that rescission is a \"self-help remedy\"\n\nunder TILA, and is therefore not subject to arbitration.3\n          A \"self-help remedy\" is a remedy \"not obtained from a\ncourt, such as repossession.\"        Blacks Law Dictionary 1297 (7th ed.\n\n1999).   The loan agreement provides that \"[t]he exercise of a\nremedy does not waive the right of either party to resort to\narbitration.\" Given this clear language, the Thompsons' attempt to\nexercise their right to rescind does not affect Irwin's right to\nhave an arbitrator decide whether there are indeed grounds for\nrescission.   Assuming    arguendo    that    the   Thompsons'   demand   for\n\nrescission of the loan agreement under TILA constitutes a self-help\n\nremedy, the same cannot be said of their subsequent commencement of\n\nlitigation in federal district court challenging Irwin's refusal to\ncooperate with their attempt at self-help. That litigation is\n\nunmistakably governed by the arbitration clause.\n\n                                     III.\n\n          The Thompsons also take issue with a provision in the\n\narbitration   agreement     that     \"[t]he    prevailing   party    in    an\narbitration shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees.\" They\n\nargue that this provision deprives them of their statutory right,\nas they see it, to pursue a TILA action with the prospect of\n\nrecovering their attorney's fees if they prevail, but with no risk\n\n\n\n     3\n          The Thompsons also suggest that rescission                 is an\n\"ancillary\" remedy, although they do not explain what this           means.\nWe note simply that the voiding of the entire loan agreement         cannot\nlogically be deemed an \"ancillary\" remedy for a violation of         TILA's\ndisclosure requirements.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fof having to pay Irwin's attorney's fees if they are unsuccessful.\n\n15 U.S.C. § 1640(a)(3).4            They point out that \"[b]y agreeing to\narbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substantive\nrights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution\n\nin an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum.\"              Mitsubishi Motors\n\nCorp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 628 (1985).\nThe   Thompsons    argue     that    the    provision    permitting    prevailing\ncreditors to recover attorney's fees is inconsistent with the\nremedial goals of TILA, a statute designed \"to vest considerable\nenforcement     power   in    'private       attorneys   general,'     individual\n\nborrowers who by suing lenders for alleged violations could achieve\n\nwidespread compliance without government intervention.\"                 Bizier v.\n\nGlobe Fin. Servs., Inc., 654 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1981).                  In their\nview, the attorney's fees provision in the arbitration agreement\n\ntaints    the     entire     arbitration         agreement   and      renders   it\n\nunenforceable.\n            We will not address the merits of that argument here,\n\nincluding the Thompson's reading of the meaning of the attorney's\n\nfees provision of the TILA. \"A court compelling arbitration should\n\n      4\n          TILA provides, in relevant part:\n\n      any   creditor   who   fails    to   comply   with   any\n      requirement . . . under [15 U.S.C. § 1635] . . . with\n      respect to any person is liable to such person in an\n      amount equal to the sum of -- . . .

Whether\nfederal public policy prohibits an individual from waiving certain\nstatutory remedies is an issue that may be raised when challenging\n\nan arbitrator's award.\" Larry's United Super, Inc. v. Werries, 253\n\nF.3d 1083, 1085-86 (8th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); accord Metro E. Ctr. for Conditioning and Health v. Qwest\n\nCommunications Int'l, Inc., 294 F.3d 924, 929 (7th Cir. 2002)\n(explaining that \"the arbitrator determines whether contractual\nlimitations on remedies are valid\"); Great W. Mortgage Corp. v.\n\nPeacock,    110   F.3d   222,    230-31    (3rd   Cir.   1997)   (\"[A]   court\n\ncompelling arbitration should decide only such issues as are\n\nessential to defining the nature of the forum in which a dispute\nwill be decided. . . .

But see Perez v. Globe Airport Sec. Servs., Inc., 253\n\nF.3d 1280, 1285-87 (11th Cir. 2001) (denying defendant's motion to\n\ncompel arbitration because arbitration agreement required plaintiff\nto waive her statutory right under Title VII to recover fees and\n\ncosts if she prevailed) (vacated per stipulation, 294 F.3d 1275\n\n(2002)); Graham Oil Co. v. Arco Prods. Co., 43 F.3d 1244, 1247-48\n\n(9th Cir. 1995) (reversing district court's decision to compel\narbitration on ground that provision in arbitration agreement\n\ndeprived plaintiff of statutory right).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f            Our refusal to decide the validity of the attorney's fees\n\nprovision at this time is consistent with our opinion in Rosenberg\nv. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 170 F.3d 1 (1st\nCir. 1999).      There, the defendant employer appealed the district\n\ncourt's denial of its motion to compel arbitration of Rosenberg's\ndiscrimination claim.       Although we affirmed the district court's\ndecision on other grounds, we first rejected Rosenberg's argument\nthat she could not be required to arbitrate her claim because the\nrules under which the arbitration would be conducted might require\nher to pay unreasonable forum fees.              Id. at 15-16.       We suggested\n\nthat if an arbitrator were in fact to award unreasonable fees\n\nagainst Rosenberg, she could then proceed to challenge the award in\n\nfederal court.     Id. at 16.    However, since no such award had yet\nbeen made, we explained that the issue \"is not presented by this\n\ncase.\"     Id.\n\n            Arbitration    is   the    correct         initial   forum   for   the\nThompsons to air their objection to the attorney's fees provision\n\nin   the   arbitration    agreement.        If    an    arbitrator    does   award\n\nattorney's fees against the Thompsons, the district court would\n\nthen be in a position to hear their argument that the challenged\n\nprovision on attorney's fees is unenforceable because it deprives\n\nthem of a statutory right.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f",

The Thompsons take issue with Irwin's delivery of blank notices of the right to rescind &#8212; that is, generic forms without the pertinent dates filled in &#8212; accompanied by \"Instructions for Completing the Notice of Right to Cancel.\" In their view, this \"do-it-yourself disclosure scheme\" does not constitute adequate notice of the right to rescind.

That litigation is unmistakably governed by the arbitration clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Thompsons also take issue with a provision in the arbitration agreement that \"[t]he prevailing party in an arbitration shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees.\" They argue that this provision deprives them of their statutory right, as they see it, to pursue a TILA action with the prospect of recovering their attorney's fees if they prevail, but with no risk of having to pay Irwin's attorney's fees if they are unsuccessful. 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1640(a)(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> They point out that \"[b]y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum.\" <i>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,</i> 473 U.S. 614, 628, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985). The Thompsons argue that the provision permitting prevailing creditors to recover attorney's fees is inconsistent with the remedial goals of TILA, a statute designed \"to vest considerable enforcement power in `private attorneys general,' individual borrowers who by suing lenders for alleged violations could achieve widespread compliance without government intervention.\" <i>Bizier v. Globe Fin. Servs., Inc.,</i> 654 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1981).

There, the defendant employer appealed the district court's denial of its motion to compel arbitration of Rosenberg's discrimination claim.

Seeing no reason why the claims should not be arbitrated, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 29, 2000, the Thompsons obtained a mortgage loan of $11,000 from Irwin Union Bank &amp; Trust Company at a disclosed annual percentage rate of 15.9%. The loan, which was assigned to Irwin Home Equity Corp. for servicing,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> was secured by the Thompsons' home, and was not made in connection with the initial acquisition or construction of the home. Hence the transaction was subject to the right of rescission provided by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635, which grants the borrower an unconditional right of rescission for the first three days following the consummation of the transaction, along with a conditional right of rescission if the creditor fails to deliver certain forms and to disclose certain information, including notice of the right to rescind itself. The statute puts a three-year time limit on the exercise of the conditional rescission right. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1635(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 24, 2001, the Thompsons commenced this action in federal district court, claiming that Irwin had violated TILA by failing to notify them of their right to rescind, as required by 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(a). The Thompsons take issue with Irwin's delivery of blank notices of the right to rescind &#8212; that is, generic forms without the pertinent dates filled in &#8212; accompanied by \"Instructions for Completing the Notice of Right to Cancel.\" In their view, this \"do-it-yourself disclosure scheme\" does not constitute adequate notice of the right to rescind. Their complaint seeks rescission of the loan agreement and damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June of 2001 Irwin filed a motion to compel arbitration, pursuant to a provision in the loan agreement that \"[a]ny controversy or claim ... arising out of or relating to this Agreement ... shall be determined by binding arbitration.\" In October of 2001 the district court entered an order compelling arbitration and dismissing the case. The Thompsons appeal from that order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Thompsons argue that the district court erred in compelling arbitration because they had rescinded their loan agreement with Irwin pursuant to TILA, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(a) (providing that borrower may rescind loan transaction by notifying creditor of intention to do so).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In their view, \"[r]escission pursuant to &#167; 1635 is automatic, and results in the consumer having no further obligation to the lender.

We explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the statute nor the regulation establishes that a borrower's mere assertion of the right of rescission has the automatic effect of voiding the contract. ... If a lender disputes a borrower's purported right to rescind, the designated decision maker &#8212; here an arbitrator &#8212; must decide whether the conditions for rescission have been met. Until such decision is made, the [borrower has] only advanced a claim seeking rescission.
