William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                    Torruella, Lynch and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n      Lloyd Matthews on memorandum in lieu of appellate brief pro\nse.\n     Nancy Ankers White, Special Assistant Attorney General, and\nJulie E. Daniele, Counsel, Department of Correction on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n\n                           December 11, 2007\n\f               Per Curiam. Lloyd Matthews sued several prison officials\n\nclaiming that he was beaten on two occasions while incarcerated at\n\nMCI Cedar Junction.           The claim alleging a March 2000 beating was\n\nrejected because Matthews had failed to exhaust his administrative\n\nremedies prior to bringing suit.                See the Prison Litigation Reform\n\nAct of 1995 (PLRA), 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a).                    Matthews went to trial\n\non a claim alleging a January 11, 2001 beating.                          Peter Pepe, who\n\nwas superintendent of MCI Cedar Junction in January 2001, was\n\ngranted    a    directed      verdict      at   the   close       of    the    evidence     on\n\nMatthews' theory of supervisory liability. The jury considered the\n\nclaim   against      Corrections        Officers      Paul    Cordeiro         and    Michael\n\nDomingos       and   found    in    the    officers'       favor.            The   jury   also\n\nconsidered a counterclaim for assault and battery filed by Domingos\n\nagainst    Matthews       and      found    in     favor     of     Matthews         on   this\n\ncounterclaim.        Matthews has appealed.            We affirm.\n\n1.   Dismissal of the March 2000 claim\n\n               Matthews      concedes       that      he    did        not     exhaust    any\n\nadministrative remedy regarding the March 2000 claim of excessive\n\nforce, but he claims that exhaustion was not required until January\n\n2001.     Whatever the exhaustion requirements of state law, PLRA,\n\nwhich   was     enacted      in    1995,   required        Matthews      to    exhaust     his\n\nadministrative remedies as a condition precedent to filing in\n\nfederal court.         In addition, Matthews concedes that claims of\n\nexcessive force during the March 2000 time period were treated as\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fcomplaints and sent directly to the superintendent. Whether or not\n\nthese claims were thus processed in a procedural manner different\n\nfrom other grievances, PLRA requires that \"[a]ll available remedies\n\nmust       now   be     exhausted;   those    remedies    need   not    meet   federal\n\nstandards, nor must they be plain, speedy, and effective.\" Porter\n\nv. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002) (emphasis added) (citation and\n\ninternal         quotation     marks   omitted).         So   long     as   there   are\n\nadministrative remedies available -- and the practice of referring\n\nclaims of excessive force directly to the superintendent evidences\n\nsuch an administrative remedy -- PLRA required Matthews to exhaust\n\nit.        He concedes that he did not.              This claim was correctly\n\ndismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.1\n\n2.    Denial of discovery and witnesses\n\n                 We review a district court's discovery ruling for abuse\n\nof discretion.           See Bogosian v. Woloohojian Realty Corp., 323 F.3d\n\n55, 64 n.7 (1st Cir. 2003).            There was no such abuse in this case.\n\nAlthough Matthews had a dozen blank cassette tapes he could have\n\nused for deposition purposes, he refused to do so, arguing they\n\nwere in reserve for other litigation, even though the tapes could\n\nbe replenished when the supply was depleted.                         The defendants\n\nprovided         some    documentary   discovery,     although       not    everything\n\nMatthews sought.            After four years, the court did not abuse its\n\n\n       1\n      Matthews' motion for leave to expand the record to include\nnon-record documents is denied. In any event, the documents would\nhave no substantive effect on the outcome of this appeal.\n\n                                             -3-\n\fdiscretion in placing this case on the running trial list and\n\ndenying further discovery efforts.    Moreover, we are not persuaded\n\nby any of Matthews' claims of prejudice from lack of discovery.\n\n           There was neither error of law nor abuse of discretion in\n\ndenying Matthews' requests for subpoenas or writs of habeas corpus\n\nad testificandum. \"[F]ederal courts are not authorized to waive or\n\npay witness fees on behalf of an in forma pauperis litigant.\"\n\nMalik v. Lavalley, 994 F.2d 90, 90 (2d Cir. 1993).      And, in any\n\nevent, to the extent that Matthews describes expected testimony by\n\nproposed witnesses, that testimony appears incompetent, irrelevant,\n\nor, at best, cumulative.\n\n3.   The counterclaim\n\n           There was no abuse of discretion in permitting the\n\ncounterclaim to be filed.   In any event, in light of the fact that\n\nthe jury rejected the counterclaim, the issue of the timeliness of\n\nits filing is moot.\n\n4.   Jury instructions\n\n           Matthews argues that, apart from instructing that his\n\nclaim stemming from the January 2001 incident alleged a violation\n\nof the 8th Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual\n\npunishment, the court should have given an additional and separate\n\ninstruction on assault and battery.   But Matthews' objections were\n\nsomewhat garbled - seemingly confusing his claim of assault and\n\nbattery with a right to claim self defense in response to Officer\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fDomingos' counterclaim.           Tr. 11/10/2004 at p. 89.        And, Matthews\n\ndid no more than raise a general complaint about the failure to\n\ninstruct on assault and battery, i.e., Matthews never presented the\n\ncourt with his own proposed instruction or explained how and why he\n\nthought the elements were distinct.           Nor, for that matter, has he\n\ndone so on appeal.\n\n           \"[P]arties objecting to a trial judge's instruction must\n\nnot only identify the error but also proffer a correct instruction\n\nor otherwise explain how the alleged error in the charge could be\n\ncorrected.\"     Estate of Keatinge v. Biddle, 316 F.3d 7, 15 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (quoting Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys., Inc., 54 F.3d 931, 944\n\n(1st Cir. 1995)).       \"In general, objections to a trial judge's\n\ncharge to the jury must be clear enough and explicit enough to tell\n\nthe trial judge what the party wishes the trial judge to say in\n\norder to correct the alleged error.\"               Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys.,\n\nInc., 54 F.3d at 946.      Accordingly, we review only for plain error,\n\nincluding whether it was sufficiently fundamental to threaten the\n\nfairness   or    integrity    or     public   reputation     of    the   judicial\n\nproceedings.      Estate     of    Keatinge   v.   Biddle,   316    F.3d   at   16\n\n(quotation and citation omitted). In light of that standard, there\n\nwas no plain error in failing to give an additional and separate\n\ninstruction on assault and battery.\n\n           The court refused to instruct on a claim of harassment,\n\nreciting that, to the extent that such a claim was not covered in\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fthe given charge, the court was excluding it for failure to\n\nexhaust.   There was no error.    For reasons addressed supra, we\n\nreject Matthews' contention that exhaustion was not required.\n\n5.   Directed verdict\n\n           There was no error in the directed verdict in favor of\n\n(then) Superintendent Pepe.   In all events, with no finding of a\n\nconstitutional violation, there can be no supervisory liability.\n\nSee Hatfield-Bermudez v. Aldanondo-Rivera, 496 F.3d 51, 63 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).\n\n6.   Evidentiary rulings\n\n           We have reviewed Matthews' numerous complaints about\n\nvarious evidentiary rulings, including the court's refusal to\n\npermit evidence of Officer Domingos' subsequent and unrelated\n\ntermination.   There was no abuse of discretion in any of contested\n\nrulings.\n\n           The judgment of the district court dated November 12,\n\n2004 is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",
