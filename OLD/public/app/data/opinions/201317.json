Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         November 1, 2004\n\f          CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.     Jeffrey D. Stearns appeals\n\nfrom the guidelines sentence imposed upon his conviction for\n\npossession of a firearm by a felon, contending that the district\n\ncourt erroneously categorized him as an armed career criminal when\n\nit refused to count as one crime his prior convictions for two\n\nburglaries committed against the same victim on consecutive days.\n\nFinding no error, we affirm.\n\n                                   I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n\n          In October 2001, Stearns was arrested and charged as a\n\nfelon in possession of firearms.   See 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).   After\n\nStearns pled guilty, the government urged the court to enhance his\n\nsentence under the armed career criminal provision, see U.S.S.G. §\n\n4B1.4; 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1) (ACCA), citing his prior convictions\n\nfor a robbery in 1975 and three burglaries in 1979.      U.S.S.G. §\n\n4B1.4(a) provides that “[a] defendant who is subject to an enhanced\n\nsentence under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) is an armed\n\ncareer criminal,” and subsection 924(e) provides, in pertinent\n\npart:\n\n          In the case of a person who violates section\n          922(g) of this title and has three previous\n          convictions by any court referred to in\n          section 922(g)(1) of this title for a violent\n          felony or a serious drug offense, or both,\n          committed on occasions different from one\n          another, such person shall be fined under this\n          title and imprisoned not less than fifteen\n          years,   and,   notwithstanding    any   other\n          provision of law, the court shall not suspend\n\n                               -2-\n\f             the sentence of, or grant a probationary\n             sentence to, such person with respect to the\n             conviction under section 922(g).\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1) (emphasis added).\n\n             Stearns responded that the two burglaries he committed at\n\nthe same warehouse on consecutive days in 1979 were not actually\n\ncommitted “on occasions different from one another” because (i) his\n\nformer employer had asked him to remove the inventory from its\n\nwarehouse as part of a scheme to defraud the employer’s insurance\n\ncompany, and thus the individual burglaries were mere steps in the\n\ncommission of a single offense; and (ii) the victim of both crimes\n\nwas the same (viz., his former employer’s insurer), which should\n\nforeclose any inference that the two burglaries were discrete ACCA\n\n“occurrences.”\n\n             The district court declined to conduct an evidentiary\n\nhearing, holding that the two burglaries were to be considered\n\ndistinct “occasions” under the ACCA.             Then, applying the armed\n\ncareer criminal enhancement, the district court sentenced Stearns\n\nto 150 months' imprisonment.        Stearns appeals.\n\n                                     II\n\n                                 DISCUSSION\n\n             First, Stearns contends that the district court erred in\n\nrefusing   to    convene   an   evidentiary    hearing   to   determine   the\n\nparticular      factual    circumstances      surrounding     the   two   1979\n\nrobberies, and whether he committed them as part of a single,\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fintegrated       criminal       scheme    which     should     be    treated   as   one\n\n“occasion” for purposes of the ACCA.                 In the alternative, Stearns\n\nargues   that     the     fact   that     there    was   but   one    victim   of   the\n\nburglaries       should     preclude       their    being      counted    separately.\n\nFollowing oral argument, Stearns submitted a letter to the court,\n\ncontending       that     the    Supreme     Court's     ruling      in   Blakely   v.\n\nWashington, 124 S. Ct. 2531, 2537 (2004) (holding that a sentence\n\nenhanced under the Washington State sentencing guidelines violated\n\nthe Sixth Amendment because the enhancement relied on factual\n\nfindings neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury),\n\npresented    a    distinct       ground    for     vacating    the    sentence.      We\n\npermitted the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the Blakely\n\nissue.\n\n            Although the Supreme Court has decided to expedite its\n\nreview of the issue of Blakely’s impact vel non upon the federal\n\nsentencing guidelines, we need not await its disposition before\n\nrejecting the Blakely argument in the instant case. First, Stearns\n\ndid not present a Sixth Amendment-based challenge to the district\n\ncourt’s § 4B1.4 enhancement, and thus the issue has been forfeited\n\nfor purposes of appeal.           See United States v. Cordoza-Estrada, ___\n\nF.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2004) [No. 03-2666, 2004 WL 2179594, at *3\n\n(1st Cir. Sept. 29, 2004)] (noting that Blakely objection had been\n\nforfeited for failure to present it to the trial court); United\n\nStates v. Savarese, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2004)[No. 04-1099,\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\f2004 WL 2106341, at *5 (1st Cir. Sept. 22, 2004)] (same); United\n\nStates v. Morgan, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2004) [No. 03-1768,\n\n2004 WL 1949061, at *5 (1st Cir. Sept. 2, 2004)] (same).   Normally,\n\nwe review forfeited claims for plain error only, and will not\n\nvacate a sentence unless we find (i) error, (ii) which is plain,\n\nand (iii) affects the defendant’s substantial rights.    See Morgan,\n\n___ F.3d at ___ [No. 03-1768, 2004 WL 1949061, at *5].     Even then,\n\nhowever, we will determine whether to exercise our discretion to\n\nnotice a forfeited error only where it seriously affected the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of the trial process.\n\nSee id.\n\n          Applying these standards, we discern no plain error.\n\nThere are but two findings of fact which could conceivably have\n\ntriggered the Blakely holding in the instant case: (i) whether the\n\ntwo burglaries constitute prior convictions for crimes of the type\n\ncounted under the ACCA, viz., “a violent felony or a serious drug\n\noffense”; and (ii) whether the particular circumstances in these\n\ntwo burglaries – his former employer’s alleged insurance fraud\n\nscheme – would suggest that the burglaries were part of a single\n\n“occasion” under the ACCA.\n\n          As to the former finding, in the district court Stearns\n\ndid not dispute that he was convicted of the two burglaries, nor\n\nthat the burglaries were the type of “violent felony” countable\n\nunder the ACCA.   Moreover, had he posed such a dispute, the Blakely\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fdecision does not encompass sentencing enhancements based upon “the\n\nfact of prior conviction,” which is not the type of circumstance\n\nwhich the Sixth Amendment mandates be determined by a jury, rather\n\nthan the sentencing court.   See Cordoza-Estrada, ___ F.3d at ___\n\n[No. 03-2666, 2004 WL 2179594, at *3 (1st Cir. Sept. 29, 2004)]\n\n(“Blakely did not disturb the distinction between ‘the fact of a\n\nprior conviction’ and other facts that ‘increase the penalty for a\n\ncrime beyond a prescribed maximum.’”).   In addition, even if “the\n\nfact of prior conviction” were not already beyond the ambit of\n\nBlakely, in the Stearns indictment the government listed the two\n\nprior burglary convictions as ACCA predicate offenses, and the\n\nStearns guilty plea would constitute an admission of fact which\n\nindependently removed his case from the operation of Blakely.   See\n\nUnited States v. Saldivar-Trujillo, 380 F.3d 274, 279 (6th Cir.\n\n2004) (noting that Blakely does not apply to “facts . . . admitted\n\nby the defendant\") (citing Blakely, 124 S. Ct. at 2537).\n\n          As concerns any alleged “factual” finding relating to\n\nwhether the particular circumstances which obtained in the two\n\nStearns burglaries would demonstrate that they constituted one\n\n“occasion,” we discern no plain error. In denying Stearns’ request\n\nfor an evidentiary hearing on this issue, the district court cited\n\nTaylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990), for the proposition\n\nthat district courts normally should not look beyond the indictment\n\nwhen determining whether a prior conviction is the type countable\n\n\n                               -6-\n\funder the ACCA.        Whether or not the district court's Taylor\n\ncitation is entirely apposite, an issue upon which we express no\n\nopinion,1    the   record    demonstrates      that    Stearns     affirmatively\n\naccepted the district court’s ruling, thereby waiving any initial\n\nrequest for such an evidentiary hearing.              Stearns' counsel stated:\n\n“So I agree with the Court, my better argument is not, let’s find\n\nout what happened 13 years ago when this burglary took place.                  You\n\ncan’t do that.”     (Emphasis added.).         Stearns, through his counsel,\n\nthen focused on a different argument that did not require further\n\nfactfinding, viz., whether the facts that the burglaries were\n\ncommitted against the same victim and on consecutive days – both\n\nundisputed historical facts – prevented the court from considering\n\nthem as separate “occasions.”              Even if we were to accept the\n\ndubious     proposition     that   the   evidentiary     hearing    proposed   by\n\nStearns would have resulted in district court “factfinding” which\n\nsomehow implicated Blakely, that issue was affirmatively waived\n\nbelow.2     Although we can review forfeited error for plain error,\n\n\n     1\n      Cf. United States v. Hudspeth, 42 F.3d 1015, 1019 (7th Cir.\n1994) (noting that Taylor applies to the issue as to whether a\nprior offense constituted a “violent felony” under the ACCA, which\nis to be decided only by reference to the statutory definition of\nthe crime, and not the particular facts underlying the conviction,\nwhereas Taylor does not apply to the question whether multiple\nprior offenses occurred on more than one “occasion” under the ACCA,\nwhich frequently necessitates reference not only to the charging\ndocuments but to other evidence, such as police reports).\n     2\n      Blakely is based on the proposition that a finding of fact\nwhich supports a sentencing enhancement is to be determined by the\njury. In light of the Stearns waiver, the applicability of Blakely\n\n                                         -7-\n\farguments which have been affirmatively waived are not normally\n\nreviewable on appeal.     See Morgan, ___ F.3d at ___ [No. 03-1768,\n\n2004 WL 1949061, at *3] (“When an argument has been waived, no\n\n[appellate] review is possible, unless the court engages in the\n\nrare exercise of its power to excuse waiver.”).         Accordingly, we\n\nreject both the Blakely claim and the Stearns contention that the\n\ndistrict court erred in refusing to permit an evidentiary hearing.\n\n           Thus, as presented, the Stearns argument devolves into a\n\nquestion of law, rather than fact; i.e., whether the undisputed\n\nfacts that the burglaries were committed against the same victim\n\nand on consecutive days prevented the district court from treating\n\nthem as separate “occasions” as prescribed by the ACCA.         Since the\n\ndetermination as to whether the Stearns burglaries occurred on a\n\nsingle   occasion   or   on   multiple   occasions   involves   statutory\n\ninterpretation, appellate review of the legal question is plenary.\n\nSee United States v. Phillips, 149 F.3d 1026, 1031 (9th Cir. 1998);\n\nUnited States v. Hobbs, 136 F.3d 384, 387 (4th Cir. 1998); United\n\nStates v. Thomas, 211 F.3d 316, 319 (6th Cir. 2000).\n\n           The “occasions” inquiry conceivably may turn upon any\n\ncombination of circumstances, including (but not limited to) the\n\nidentity of the victim; the type of crime; the time interval\n\nbetween the crimes; the location of the crimes; the continuity vel\n\n\nis yet more dubious, inasmuch as the district court’s enhancement\ndid not rely upon a finding of fact, but upon its refusal to engage\nin factfinding.\n\n                                   -8-\n\fnon of the defendant’s conduct; and/or the apparent motive for the\n\ncrimes. See United States v. Letterlough, 63 F.3d 332, 335-36 (4th\n\nCir. 1995).     Thus, the \"occasions\" inquiry requires a case-by-case\n\nexamination of the totality of the circumstances.                See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Riddle, 47 F.3d 460, 462 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n              Stearns contends that the determinative consideration is\n\nthat both burglaries were directed against the same victim and\n\noccurred on consecutive days.       His contention flies in the face of\n\nthe case law.     See, e.g., Letterlough, 63 F.3d at 337 (holding that\n\ndefendant’s two sales of cocaine – within 90 minutes of each other\n\n– to same police officer constituted two ACCA “occasions”); United\n\nStates   v.    Washington,   898   F.2d   439,   440-42   (5th   Cir.   1990)\n\n(considering two robberies of same store clerk – committed several\n\nhours apart – as separate “occasions” under the ACCA). These cases\n\nmake the crucial distinction between (i) a time interval during\n\nwhich defendant successfully has completed his first crime, safely\n\nescaped, and which affords defendant a “breather,” viz., a period\n\n(however brief) which is devoid of criminal activity and in which\n\nhe may contemplate whether or not to commit the second crime; and\n\n(ii) a time lapse which does not mark the endpoint of the first\n\ncrime, but merely the natural consequence of a continuous course of\n\nextended criminal conduct. See, e.g., Washington, 898 F.2d at 442.\n\nThus, the fact that two crimes involve the same victim does not\n\nnecessarily prevent those crimes from being considered \"separate,\"\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\feven though the time interval between them may have been quite\n\nbrief.\n\n          Applying these principles to the Stearns burglaries, we\n\nconclude that each represented a distinct ACCA “occurrence.”    On\n\nDecember 19, 1979, Stearns committed the first burglary, escaped\n\ndetection, waited overnight, and then returned to the warehouse to\n\ncommit the second burglary.   The overnight respite precludes any\n\nreasonable inference that Stearns committed the two burglaries as\n\npart of a continuous course of conduct, inasmuch as during the time\n\nlapse Stearns had the opportunity affirmatively to decide whether\n\nto initiate another criminal episode. Under any reasonable view of\n\nthese circumstances, Stearns engaged in two distinct burglaries,\n\nalbeit against the same victim.\n\n          Accordingly, the ACCA enhancement imposed by the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.4(a) provides that \"[a] defendant who is subject to an enhanced sentence under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e) is an armed career criminal,\" and subsection 924(e) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed <i>on occasions different from one another,</i> such person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than fifteen years, and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court shall not suspend the sentence of, or grant a probationary sentence to, such person with respect to the conviction under section 922(g).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stearns responded that the two burglaries he committed at the same warehouse on consecutive days in 1979 were not actually committed \"on occasions different from one another\" because (i) his former employer had asked him to remove the inventory from its warehouse as part of a scheme to defraud the employer's insurance company, and thus the individual burglaries were mere steps in the commission of a single offense; and (ii) the victim of both crimes was the same (<i>viz.,</i> his former employer's insurer), which should foreclose any inference that the two burglaries were discrete ACCA \"occurrences.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court declined to conduct an evidentiary hearing, holding that the two burglaries were to be considered distinct \"occasions\" under the ACCA.

In the alternative, Stearns argues that the fact that there was but one victim of the burglaries should preclude their being counted separately. Following oral argument, Stearns submitted a letter to the court, contending that the Supreme Court's ruling in <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) (holding that a sentence enhanced under the Washington State sentencing guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment because the enhancement relied on factual findings neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury), presented a distinct ground for vacating the sentence.

First, Stearns did not present a Sixth Amendment-based challenge to the district court's &#167; 4B1.4 enhancement, and thus the issue has been forfeited for purposes of appeal. <i>See United States v. Cordoza-Estrada,</i> 385 F.3d 56, 59 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that <i>Blakely</i> objection had been forfeited for failure to present it to the trial court); <i>United States v.

Normally, we review forfeited claims for plain error only, and will not vacate a sentence unless we find (i) error, (ii) which is plain, and (iii) affects the defendant's substantial rights. <i>See Morgan,</i> 384 F.3d at 7.

There are but two findings of fact which could conceivably have triggered the <i>Blakely</i> holding in the instant case: (i) whether the two burglaries constitute prior convictions for crimes of the type counted under the ACCA, <i>viz.,</i> \"a violent felony or a serious drug offense\"; and (ii) whether the particular circumstances in these two burglaries&#8212;his former employer's alleged insurance fraud scheme&#8212;would suggest that the burglaries were part of a single \"occasion\" under the ACCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the former finding, in the district court Stearns did not dispute that he was convicted of the two burglaries, nor that the burglaries were the type of \"violent felony\" countable under the ACCA. Moreover, had he posed such a dispute, the <i>Blakely</i> decision does not encompass sentencing enhancements based upon \"the fact of prior conviction,\" which is not the type of circumstance which the Sixth Amendment mandates be determined by a jury, rather than the sentencing court. <i>See Cordoza-Estrada,</i> 385 F.3d at 59 (\"<i>Blakely</i> did not disturb the distinction between `the fact of a prior conviction' and other facts that `increase the penalty for a crime beyond a prescribed maximum.'\"). In addition, even if \"the fact of prior conviction\" were not already beyond the ambit of <i>Blakely,</i> in the Stearns indictment the government listed the two prior burglary convictions as ACCA predicate offenses, and the Stearns guilty plea would constitute an admission of fact which independently removed his case from the operation of <i>Blakely.

Stearns' counsel stated: \"So I agree with the Court, my better argument is not, let's find out what happened 13 years ago when this burglary took place. <i>You can't do that.\"</i> (Emphasis added.). Stearns, through his counsel, then focused on a different argument that did not require further factfinding, <i>viz.,</i> whether the facts that the burglaries were committed against the same victim and on consecutive days&#8212;both undisputed historical facts&#8212; prevented the court from considering them as separate \"occasions.\" Even if we were to accept the dubious proposition that the evidentiary hearing proposed by Stearns would have resulted in district court \"factfinding\" which somehow implicated <i>Blakely,</i> that issue was affirmatively waived below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Although we can review forfeited error for plain error, arguments which have been affirmatively waived are not normally reviewable on appeal. <i>See Morgan,</i> 384 F.3d at 7 (\"When an argument has been waived, no [appellate] review is possible, unless the court engages in the rare exercise of its power to excuse waiver.\").

These cases make the crucial distinction between (i) a time interval during which defendant successfully has completed his first crime, safely escaped, and which affords defendant a \"breather,\" <i>viz.,</i> a period (however brief) which is devoid of criminal activity and in which he may contemplate whether or not to commit the second crime; and (ii) a time lapse which does not mark the endpoint of the first crime, but merely the natural consequence of a continuous course of extended criminal conduct. <i>See, e.g., Washington,</i> 898 F.2d at 442.

The overnight respite precludes any reasonable inference that Stearns committed the two burglaries as part of a continuous course of conduct, inasmuch as during the time lapse Stearns had the opportunity affirmatively to decide whether to initiate another criminal episode.

Stearns appeals from the guidelines sentence imposed upon his conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon, contending that the district court erroneously categorized him as an armed career criminal when it refused to count as one crime his prior convictions for two burglaries committed against the same victim on consecutive days. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">* <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2001, Stearns was arrested and charged as a felon in possession of firearms. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1). After Stearns pled guilty, the government urged the court to enhance his sentence under the armed career criminal provision, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.4; 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1) (ACCA), citing his prior convictions for a robbery in 1975 and three burglaries in 1979. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.4(a) provides that \"[a] defendant who is subject to an enhanced sentence under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e) is an armed career criminal,\" and subsection 924(e) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed <i>on occasions different from one another,</i> such person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than fifteen years, and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court shall not suspend the sentence of, or grant a probationary sentence to, such person with respect to the conviction under section 922(g).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stearns responded that the two burglaries he committed at the same warehouse on consecutive days in 1979 were not actually committed \"on occasions different from one another\" because (i) his former employer had asked him to remove the inventory from its warehouse as part of a scheme to defraud the employer's insurance company, and thus the individual burglaries were mere steps in the commission of a single offense; and (ii) the victim of both crimes was the same (<i>viz.,</i> his former employer's insurer), which should foreclose any inference that the two burglaries were discrete ACCA \"occurrences.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court declined to conduct an evidentiary hearing, holding that the two burglaries were to be considered distinct \"occasions\" under the ACCA. Then, applying the armed career criminal enhancement, the district court sentenced Stearns to 150 months' imprisonment. Stearns appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Stearns contends that the district court erred in refusing to convene an evidentiary hearing to determine the particular factual circumstances surrounding the two 1979 robberies, and whether he committed them as part of a single, integrated criminal scheme which should be treated as one \"occasion\" for purposes of the ACCA. In the alternative, Stearns argues that the fact that there was but one victim of the burglaries should preclude their being counted separately. Following oral argument, Stearns submitted a letter to the court, contending that the Supreme Court's ruling in <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span> (2004) (holding that a sentence enhanced under the Washington State sentencing guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment because the enhancement relied on factual findings neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury), presented a distinct ground for vacating the sentence. We permitted the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the <i>Blakely</i> issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Supreme Court has decided to expedite its review of the issue of <i>Blakely's</i> impact <i>vel non</i> upon the federal sentencing guidelines, we need not await its disposition before rejecting the <i>Blakely</i> argument in the instant case. First, Stearns did not present a Sixth Amendment-based challenge to the district court's &#167; 4B1.4 enhancement, and thus the issue has been forfeited for purposes of appeal. <i>See United States v. Cordoza-Estrada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201261\"><a href=\"/opinion/201261/united-states-v-cordoza-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 59 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that <i>Blakely</i> objection had been forfeited for failure to present it to the trial court); <i>United States v.

Normally, we review forfeited claims for plain error only, and will not vacate a sentence unless we find (i) error, (ii) which is plain, and (iii) affects the defendant's substantial rights. <i>See Morgan,</i> 384 F.3d at 7. Even then, however, we will determine whether to exercise our discretion to notice a forfeited error only where it seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the trial process. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these standards, we discern no plain error.

Thus, the fact that two crimes involve the same victim does not necessarily prevent those crimes from being considered \"separate,\" even though the time interval between them may have been quite brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these principles to the Stearns burglaries, we conclude that each represented a distinct ACCA \"occurrence.\" On December 19, 1979, Stearns committed the first burglary, escaped detection, waited overnight, and then returned to the warehouse to commit the second burglary. The overnight respite precludes any reasonable inference that Stearns committed the two burglaries as part of a continuous course of conduct, inasmuch as during the time lapse Stearns had the opportunity affirmatively to decide whether to initiate another criminal episode. Under any reasonable view of these circumstances, Stearns engaged in two distinct burglaries, albeit against the same victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Accordingly, the ACCA enhancement imposed by the district court is affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>Cf.
