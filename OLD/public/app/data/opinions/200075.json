After Angel Lopez pleaded guilty\n\nto charges that he trafficked in heroin, he was sentenced to 216\n\nmonths in prison and five years of supervised release.         Lopez\n\nappeals his term of incarceration on the ground that the district\n\ncourt erred in giving him a two-level enhancement pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(3) for distribution of heroin inside a prison.\n\nHe appeals his supervised release term on the ground that it\n\nexceeds the maximum term permitted under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B).\n\nSeeing no merit in his arguments, we affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            On July 8, 1999, Lopez and nineteen co-defendants were\ncharged in a multi-count drug trafficking indictment.      Lopez was\ncharged with conspiracy to distribute heroin from about September\n\nof 1996 to about March of 1999, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846,\nand with twelve counts of distributing heroin, in violation of 21\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1).    On May 19, 2000, Lopez pleaded guilty to all\n\ncharges.1   He was sentenced on October 18, 2000, to 216 months in\nprison and five years of supervised release.\n            \"Because this appeal involves sentencing issues following\na guilty plea, we take the background facts from the presentence\n\nreport\" (PSR).   United States v. Brady, 168 F.3d 574, 576 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).   In August, 1996, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)\n\nreceived information from a confidential informant that Wilfredo\n\n\n     1\n         Lopez also was charged with, and pleaded guilty to,\nconspiring to distribute marijuana. He was sentenced for that\noffense on August 31, 2000.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fCortes (Lopez's half-brother), who at the time was incarcerated in\n\na Massachusetts state prison, was running a heroin distribution\noperation in and around Lynn, Massachusetts, in conjunction with\nLopez and Christine James (Cortes' girlfriend).           The confidential\n\ninformant put Cortes in contact with a prospective heroin purchaser\nwho,   unbeknownst      to   the   conspirators,   was     an     undercover\nMassachusetts state police officer.           Cortes informed Lopez and\nJames that the undercover officer would be contacting them to\npurchase heroin. On numerous occasions between October of 1996 and\nFebruary of 1999, Lopez obtained heroin from co-defendants Domingo\n\nAcevedo and Rafael Acevedo and sold it to the undercover officer.\n\nNotwithstanding       his    incarceration,    Cortes     had     \"telephone\n\nconversations with both Lopez and James about the heroin sales to\nthe undercover officer and the return of money to [Cortes] from the\n\nsales.\"\n\n          The plea agreement stipulated that Lopez was responsible\nfor 733.9 grams of heroin and that his base offense level was 30.\n\nThe PSR recommended that Lopez receive a three-level enhancement\n\nfor his role in the offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(b) (\"If\nthe defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or\n\nleader)   and   the    criminal    activity    involved    five    or   more\n\nparticipants or was otherwise extensive, increase by 3 levels.\").\n\nThe PSR also recommended a three-level reduction for acceptance of\nresponsibility.       See U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1.        In addition, and of\n\nimportance to this appeal, the PSR recommended a two-level increase\n\npursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(3), which provides: \"If the object\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fof the offense was the distribution of a controlled substance in a\n\nprison, correctional facility, or detention facility, increase by\n2 levels.\"\n            Lopez's counsel objected at the sentencing hearing to the\n\ntwo-level increase under § 2D1.1(b)(3) on the ground that \"there's\nno evidence that my client actually was involved in bringing any\ndrugs into the prison.\"    The government concurred, explaining that\nwhile \"there were tape recorded conversations [between Cortes and\nJames] in which there was a lot of talk in August of 1996 about\npossibly having heroin smuggled into the prison,\" there was \"no\n\nevidence that any heroin was actually smuggled into the prison.\"\n\nThe government's position, the prosecutor explained, was that \"the\n\nobject of the conspiracy was for the undercover officer to make\npurchases of heroin on the outside from either Mr. Lopez or Ms.\n\nJames and that money would then be funneled back to Mr. Cortes in\n\nthe prison.\"\n             The district court declined to adopt the government's\n\nposition:\n\n             contrary to the argument that has been made to\n             me, I find by a fair preponderance of the\n             evidence that the conspiracy to import drugs\n             into the prison did involve Mr. Angel Lopez\n             knowingly and that the two level enhancement\n             does apply in his case.\nThis conclusion resulted in an adjusted offense level of 32 under\n\nthe drug guidelines. Because Lopez's criminal history category was\n\nVI, his sentencing range was 210 to 262 months.2        The district\n\n     2\n         Lopez's criminal history category was VI because he\nqualified as a career offender. See U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1 (\"A career\n\n                                  -4-\n\fcourt sentenced Lopez to 216 months in prison and five years of\n\nsupervised release.    Lopez appeals.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            We review the sentencing court's factual findings, which\n\nmust be supported by a preponderance of the evidence, for clear\nerror.    United States v. Damon, 127 F.3d 139, 141 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n\"Under this standard, a district court's determination will be\n\ntreated   with   deference   and   will   be   reversed     only    if,   after\nreviewing all the evidence, we are left with the definite and firm\n\nconviction that a mistake has been committed.\"              United States v.\n\nRust, 976 F.2d 55, 57 (1st Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n            In challenging the two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2D1.1(b)(3), Lopez asserts that just one of the PSR's 425\n\nparagraphs describes a conspiracy to distribute drugs inside a\nprison.    Paragraph seven of the PSR states:\n\n            DEA obtained tapes of outgoing collect\n            telephone calls placed by [the incarcerated]\n            Cortes beginning on August 19, 1996. . . .\n            The tapes revealed numerous telephone calls\n            from Cortes to James in which they discussed\n            the fact that James was holding heroin for\n            Cortes and that arrangements were being made\n            to have the heroin delivered into the prison.\n            At various times, Cortes instructed James to\n            divide the heroin, to wait for the call of the\n            person who would be smuggling the heroin into\n            the prison, to get a note with instructions\n            from [Lopez], to give [Lopez] a quantity of\n            money, and to contact \"my brother\" and \"Amy\"\n            (Tavis).   There were multiple conversations\n\n\noffender's criminal    history     category    in   every    case    shall   be\nCategory VI.\").\n\n                                   -5-\n\f            about these topics between Cortes and James\n            from August 19, 1996 through August 25, 1996.\nLopez argues that \"while it may be true that Cortes and James\n\ndiscussed     distributing    drugs    within    a     prison,    there    is     no\nallegation that either Cortes or James ever spoke to Lopez about\nthis idea.\"    He points out that the government characterized these\n\ntelephone calls at the sentencing hearing as simply \"a lot of talk\"\nabout possibly smuggling heroin into the prison, and cites the\nprosecutor's assertion that there was no evidence that any such\nsmuggling was     in   fact   accomplished.       The    government       takes    a\n\ndifferent     position   on    appeal,       arguing    that     the   two-level\n\nenhancement was proper.\n            We note three preliminary points.            First, \"a sentencing\n\ncourt may consider facts contained in the PSI Report as reliable\n\nevidence.\"     United States v. Cruz, 120 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nSecond, the district court was free to disregard the government's\n\nposition at sentencing regarding the § 2D1.1(b)(3) enhancement.\n\nSee United States v. Valencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4, 7 (1st Cir. 1986)\n\n(\"[O]ur cases clearly bar any relief merely because a judge refuses\n\nto accept the sentence recommendations of a prosecutor, so long as\n\nthe defendant has not been misled.\").           Third, in order to conclude\n\nthat Lopez had participated in a conspiracy the object of which was\nthe distribution of drugs inside a prison, the district court was\n\nnot required to find that Lopez had committed an overt act in\n\nfurtherance of that conspiracy.             See United States v. Cruz, 981\n\nF.2d 613, 617 & n.7 (1st Cir. 1992) (explaining that, in contrast\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fto common-law conspiracy, government does not have to prove an\n\novert act to win a conviction under 21 U.S.C. § 846).\n          Lopez wrongly asserts that only paragraph seven of the\nPSR relates to the district court's findings. Paragraph twenty-one\n\nof the PSR reports that Lopez at one point asked the undercover\nofficer if the heroin she was purchasing was for her husband, her\nboyfriend, or \"someone in jail.\"      As the government argues, this\nwas \"an odd question unless prison sales was something in which\nLopez was actively involved.\"\n          Paragraph five of the PSR indicates that law enforcement\n\nofficials had received a report from a confidential informant that\n\nCortes, James, and Lopez were involved in the distribution of\n\nheroin inside a state prison:\n          In August 1996, DEA received information from\n          a confidential informant (\"CI\") that Cortes\n          was running a heroin distribution business\n          inside state prison and that he was assisted\n          in this endeavor by Lopez and James. The CI\n          reported that Cortes recruited customers by\n          offering them a percentage of the heroin that\n          was smuggled into the prison and that he had\n          persons smuggle heroin into the prison during\n          visits with inmates. The CI reported that a\n          customer would make arrangements to have money\n          sent to Lopez or James, that heroin would be\n          smuggled into the prison and delivered to\n          Cortes, that Cortes would give a portion of\n          the heroin to the customer, and that Cortes\n          would sell the remainder. The CI provided DEA\n          with the home telephone numbers of both Lopez\n          and James in Lynn.\n\nAlthough the confidential informant's statement is hearsay, we have\n\nheld that a sentencing court \"'may consider relevant information\nwithout regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence\n\napplicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient\n\n                                -7-\n\findicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.'\"                          United\nStates v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1287 (1st Cir. 1992) (quoting\nU.S.S.G. § 6A1.3(a)); see also United States v. Powell, 50 F.3d 94,\n\n103 (1st Cir. 1995) (upholding sentencing determination based in\n\npart   on   hearsay       evidence     in    presentence       report    supplied         by\nconfidential informant).            Here, the government points out that the\nconfidential informant's account was corroborated in significant\nrespects.         James     and     Lopez    were    indeed      running       a    heroin\ndistribution operation, and recorded conversations between Cortes\nand James corroborated the confidential informant's assertion that\n\nsmuggling heroin into a prison was among their objectives.                                We\n\ntherefore conclude that the confidential informant's report in\n\nparagraph five of the PSR had \"sufficient indicia of reliability to\nsupport     its   probable        accuracy.\"        Tardiff,     969    F.2d       at   1287\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n             Lopez is correct that paragraph seven of the PSR contains\nno direct evidence that he conspired to distribute heroin inside a\n\nprison. Paragraph seven does, however, constitute circumstantial\n\nevidence implicating Lopez in that project, and it is not the only\n\nevidence    found    in    the     PSR.      Based    on   (1)   Lopez's       extensive\n\nparticipation in the heroin business with Cortes and James; (2) the\n\ndiscussions between Cortes and James about plans to distribute\n\nheroin    inside    a     prison    with    Lopez's    assistance;       (3)       Lopez's\nquestion to the undercover officer about purchasing heroin for\n\n\"someone in jail\"; and (4) the confidential informant's report, we\n\ncannot say that the district court clearly erred in drawing the\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\finference, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Lopez had\n\nconspired with Cortes and James to distribute heroin inside a\nprison.   See Damon, 127 F.3d at 141.\n\n          We acknowledge that the actual drug sales documented in\n\nthe PSR were made by Lopez to the undercover officer and did not\nentail distribution inside a prison. But that fact simply reflects\nthe nature of the government's undercover operation.                     As the\ngovernment points out, nothing in the guideline requires that\ndistribution inside a prison be the sole object of the conspiracy.\n\nSee U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(3), historical notes (explaining that 1995\n\namendment added two-level enhancement \"for an offense involving a\n\nprison or detention facility\" (emphasis added)).                We therefore\n\naffirm the two-level enhancement.\n\n                                    III.\n\n          In    addition   to   a   prison   term   of   216   months,    Lopez\nreceived a five-year term of supervised release. On its face, this\n\nterm is consistent with the statute under which he was sentenced,\n\n21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B), which provides for a term of supervised\nrelease of \"at least 4 years.\"       However, Lopez cites United States\n\nv. Barnes, 244 F.3d 172, 178 (1st Cir. 2001), for the proposition\nthat \"supervised release terms set out in particular sections of\n\nthe drug laws establish the maximum terms for violations of those\nsections.\"     Based on this statement in Barnes, he argues that his\n\nfive-year term of supervised release should be vacated because it\n\n\"exceeds the term set forth in [21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)].\"                  He\npoints out that 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B) provides for a term of\n\n                                     -9-\n\fsupervised release of \"at least 4 years\" and argues that according\n\nto Barnes four years is the maximum term of supervised release to\nwhich he can be sentenced.\n            The   government   responds   that   the   phrase   \"at   least\"\n\nestablishes a mandatory minimum, but no maximum, and that a five-\nyear term of supervised release is therefore permissible under\n§ 841(b)(1)(B).     We agree with the government that the five-year\nterm of supervised release Lopez received is consistent with the\nstatutory provision for a term of supervised release of \"at least\n4 years.\"    § 841(b)(1)(B).      To the extent that Barnes suggests\n\notherwise, we conclude that the above-quoted statement in Barnes,\n\n244 F.3d at 178, is limited to the specific facts of that case.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f",

The CI reported that a customer would make arrangements to have money sent to Lopez or James, that heroin would be smuggled into the prison and delivered to Cortes, that Cortes would give a portion of the heroin to the customer, and that Cortes would sell the remainder.

Here, the government points out that the confidential informant's account was corroborated in significant respects. James and Lopez were indeed running a heroin distribution operation, and recorded conversations between Cortes and James corroborated the confidential informant's assertion that smuggling heroin into a prison was among their objectives. We therefore conclude that the confidential informant's report in paragraph five of the PSR had \"sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\" <i>Tardiff,</i> 969 F.2d at 1287 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez is correct that paragraph seven of the PSR contains no direct evidence that he conspired to distribute heroin inside a prison. Paragraph seven does, however, constitute circumstantial evidence implicating Lopez in that project, and it is not the only evidence found in the PSR. Based on (1) Lopez's extensive participation in the heroin business with Cortes and James; (2) the discussions between Cortes and James about plans to distribute heroin inside a prison with Lopez's assistance; (3) Lopez's question to the undercover officer about purchasing heroin for \"someone in jail\"; and (4) the confidential informant's report, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in drawing the inference, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Lopez had conspired with Cortes and James to distribute heroin inside a prison. <i>See Damon,</i> 127 F.3d at 141.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that the actual drug sales documented in the PSR were made by Lopez to the undercover officer and did not entail distribution inside a prison. But that fact simply reflects the nature of the government's undercover operation. As the government points out, nothing in the guideline requires that distribution inside a prison be the <i>sole</i> object of the conspiracy. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(3), historical notes (explaining that 1995 amendment added two-level enhancement \"for an offense <i>involving</i> a prison or detention facility\" (emphasis added)). We therefore affirm the two-level enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to a prison term of 216 months, Lopez received a five-year term of supervised release. On its face, this term is consistent with the statute under which he was sentenced, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B), which provides for a term of supervised release of \"at least 4 years.\" However, Lopez cites <i>United States v. Barnes,</i> 244 F.3d 172, 178 (1st Cir.2001), for the proposition that \"supervised release terms set out in particular sections of the drug laws establish the maximum terms for violations of those sections.\" Based on this statement in <i>Barnes,</i> he argues that his five-year term of supervised release should be vacated because it \"exceeds the term set forth in [21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B)].\" He points out that 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B) provides for a term of supervised release of \"at least 4 years\" and argues that according to <i>Barnes</i> four years is the maximum term of supervised release to which he can be sentenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responds that the phrase \"at least\" establishes a mandatory minimum, but no maximum, and that a five-year term of supervised release is therefore permissible under &#167; 841(b)(1)(B). We agree with the government that the five-year term of supervised release Lopez received is consistent with the statutory provision for a term of supervised release of \"at least 4 years.\" &#167; 841(b)(1)(B). To the extent that <i>Barnes</i> suggests otherwise, we conclude that the above-quoted statement in <i>Barnes,</i> 244 F.3d at 178, is limited to the specific facts of that case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Lopez also was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, conspiring to distribute marijuana.

The confidential informant put Cortes in contact with a prospective heroin purchaser who, unbeknownst to the conspirators, was an undercover Massachusetts state police officer. Cortes informed Lopez and James that the undercover officer would be contacting them to purchase heroin. On numerous occasions between October of 1996 and February of 1999, Lopez obtained heroin from co-defendants Domingo Acevedo and Rafael Acevedo and sold it to the undercover officer.

Tardiff,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587242\"><a href=\"/opinion/587242/united-states-v-claude-paul-tardiff/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1283</span></a></span>, 1287 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.3(a)); <i>see also United States v. Powell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195990\"><a href=\"/opinion/195990/united-states-v-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 103 (1st Cir.1995) (upholding sentencing determination based in part on hearsay evidence in presentence report supplied by confidential informant). Here, the government points out that the confidential informant's account was corroborated in significant respects. James and Lopez were indeed running a heroin distribution operation, and recorded conversations between Cortes and James corroborated the confidential informant's assertion that smuggling heroin into a prison was among their objectives. We therefore conclude that the confidential informant's report in paragraph five of the PSR had \"sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\" <i>Tardiff,</i> 969 F.2d at 1287 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez is correct that paragraph seven of the PSR contains no direct evidence that he conspired to distribute heroin inside a prison. Paragraph seven does, however, constitute circumstantial evidence implicating Lopez in that project, and it is not the only evidence found in the PSR. Based on (1) Lopez's extensive participation in the heroin business with Cortes and James; (2) the discussions between Cortes and James about plans to distribute heroin inside a prison with Lopez's assistance; (3) Lopez's question to the undercover officer about purchasing heroin for \"someone in jail\"; and (4) the confidential informant's report, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in drawing the inference, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Lopez had conspired with Cortes and James to distribute heroin inside a prison. <i>See Damon,</i> 127 F.3d at 141.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that the actual drug sales documented in the PSR were made by Lopez to the undercover officer and did not entail distribution inside a prison. But that fact simply reflects the nature of the government's undercover operation. As the government points out, nothing in the guideline requires that distribution inside a prison be the <i>sole</i> object of the conspiracy. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(3), historical notes (explaining that 1995 amendment added two-level enhancement \"for an offense <i>involving</i> a prison or detention facility\" (emphasis added)). We therefore affirm the two-level enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to a prison term of 216 months, Lopez received a five-year term of supervised release. On its face, this term is consistent with the statute under which he was sentenced, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B), which provides for a term of supervised release of \"at least 4 years.\" However, Lopez cites <i>United States v. Barnes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199335\"><a href=\"/opinion/199335/united-states-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span>, 178 (1st Cir.2001), for the proposition that \"supervised release terms set out in particular sections of the drug laws establish the maximum terms for violations of those sections.\" Based on this statement in <i>Barnes,</i> he argues that his five-year term of supervised release should be vacated because it \"exceeds the term set forth in [21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B)].\" He points out that 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B) provides for a term of supervised release of \"at least 4 years\" and argues that according to <i>Barnes</i> four years is the maximum term of supervised release to which he can be sentenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responds that the phrase \"at least\" establishes a mandatory minimum, but no maximum, and that a five-year term of supervised release is therefore permissible under &#167; 841(b)(1)(B). We agree with the government that the five-year term of supervised release Lopez received is consistent with the statutory provision for a term of supervised release of \"at least 4 years.\" &#167; 841(b)(1)(B). To the extent that <i>Barnes</i> suggests otherwise, we conclude that the above-quoted statement in <i>Barnes,</i> 244 F.3d at 178, is limited to the specific facts of that case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Lopez also was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, conspiring to distribute marijuana.
