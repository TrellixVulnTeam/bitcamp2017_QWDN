David Fiacco brought suit\n\nagainst    the   national       fraternity        Sigma     Alpha    Epsilon      (\"SAE\")\n\nalleging    that      members    of    its    Maine     chapter      (\"Maine       Alpha\")\n\nintentionally caused him psychological harm by exposing his past\n\nlegal troubles to his employer and two local newspapers.                               The\n\ndistrict court granted SAE summary judgment on Fiacco’s intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress claim, and Fiacco now contests\n\nthis order.      After careful review, we affirm.\n\n                                     I. Background\n\n            This      action    is    an    appeal    from    a     grant    of   summary\n\njudgment, therefore we recite the facts in the light most favorable\n\nto Fiacco as non-movant.             See, e.g., Franceschi v. U.S. Dep't of\n\nVeterans Affairs, 514 F.3d 81, 84 (1st Cir. 2008).                     Fiacco was the\n\nDirector    of     the   Office       of    Community       Standards,      Rights     and\n\nResponsibilities         (\"Office      of     Community       Standards\")         at   the\n\nUniversity of Maine at Orono (\"UMO\").                   In this capacity, Fiacco\n\noversaw    the   student       discipline         process    at   UMO:      he    reviewed\n\nallegations      of   misconduct;          assigned   case     managers      to     handle\n\ngrievances; referred cases to UMO administrators or the Conduct\n\nCommittee for adjudication; and occasionally adjudicated cases\n\nhimself, subject to review by the Conduct Committee.                        Fiacco also\n\ndeveloped policy statements concerning the student code of conduct\n\nand his office, and he answered questions on such matters from\n\nmembers of the UMO community.\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\f           In 2002, Fiacco's office started investigating Maine\n\nAlpha for misconduct.       In response, a group of current and former\n\nMaine Alpha members led by Jay Sexton (collectively, \"the Sexton\n\nGroup\") hired a private investigator to uncover evidence of any\n\nbias Fiacco might hold against SAE or fraternities in general. The\n\ninvestigator found several court records and newspaper articles\n\ndating back to Fiacco's college years.          Those documents revealed\n\nFiacco's past involvement in two legal proceedings: a conviction\n\nfor Driving While Ability Impaired (\"DWAI\") that resulted in his\n\ndeparture from the post of Director of Public Safety at Fort Lewis\n\nCollege in Colorado, and a temporary restraining order secured\n\nagainst   him   by   a   former   girlfriend.    The   documents   gave   no\n\nindication that Fiacco was biased against fraternities or, in\n\nparticular, SAE.\n\n           The Sexton Group made copies of these documents and\n\nassembled them into packages containing the following unsigned\n\nmemorandum:\n\n                  Enclosed please find newspaper articles\n           and court documents detailing Mr. Fiacco's\n           previous legal difficulties: DWI, Sexual\n           harassment, and Domestic Violence.     Is this\n           honestly the best qualified candidate the\n           University of Maine could find for the Office\n           of Judicial Affairs?\n\nThe packages were addressed to the University of Maine System Board\n\nof Trustees, UMO President Peter S. Hoff, several UMO deans and two\n\nlocal newspapers, the Bangor Daily News and The Maine Campus. They\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fwere placed in a box and mailed to a Maine Alpha alumnus in\n\nColorado, who then anonymously sent the packages to the intended\n\nrecipients.\n\n            Fiacco asserts that the disclosure of this information\n\nand the surreptitious manner in which it was disseminated caused\n\nhim great distress. As a result he became depressed and withdrawn,\n\nand his concentration and work performance suffered.       He also\n\nexperienced bouts of insomnia, nightmares, and teeth-grinding, and\n\nhad to obtain psychological counseling.\n\n            On September 19, 2005, Fiacco brought suit against SAE\n\nasserting, inter alia, intentional infliction of emotional distress\n\n(\"IIED\").     Federal subject-matter jurisdiction was established\n\nthrough the diversity of the parties' citizenship.   On October 12,\n\n2006, SAE moved for summary judgment and -- with the benefit of\n\nextensive discovery, oral argument, and additional briefing -- the\n\ndistrict court granted this motion on April 5, 2007.   The district\n\ncourt found that Fiacco was both a public official and a limited-\n\npurpose public figure; hence Fiacco's IIED claim failed because he\n\nwas unable to prove that the memorandum included in the Sexton\n\nGroup's packages contained a statement of fact made with actual\n\nmalice. See Fiacco v. Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity, 484 F. Supp.\n\n2d 158, 175 (D. Me. 2007).1   Fiacco now appeals.\n\n\n1\n  For the purpose of summary judgment the district court chose not\nto draw a distinction between SAE, the national fraternity, and the\nSexton Group or Maine Alpha. In this opinion we do likewise.\n\n                                -4-\n\f                                  II. Discussion\n\n            A. Standard of Review\n\n            Summary judgment is appropriate when the record shows\n\nthat \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that\n\nthe movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"                     Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(c).       We review the grant of such a motion de novo.              GTE\n\nWireless, Inc. v. Cellexis Int'l, Inc., 341 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).     In doing so, we are obliged to \"view the entire record in\n\nthe light most hospitable to the party opposing summary judgment,\n\nindulging    all     reasonable     inferences    in    that   party's      favor.\"\n\nGriggs-Ryan     v.      Smith,    904   F.2d   112,    115   (1st    Cir.    1990).\n\nNonetheless,       we    ignore    \"'conclusory       allegations,    improbable\n\ninferences, and unsupported speculation.'\" Suárez v. Pueblo Int'l,\n\nInc., 229 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing Medina-Muñoz v. R.J.\n\nReynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990)).                          With\n\nspecific regard to Fiacco's IIED claim, whether a plaintiff is a\n\npublic official or public figure is an issue of law that we review\n\nde novo.    Dixon v. Int'l Bhd. of Police Officers, 504 F.3d 73, 87-\n\n88 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            B. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n\n            Under Maine law, Fiacco's IIED claim survives summary\n\njudgment if the facts establish that: 1) SAE intentionally or\n\nrecklessly inflicted severe emotional distress or was certain or\n\nsubstantially certain that such distress would result from its\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fconduct; 2) SAE's conduct was \"so extreme and outrageous as to\n\nexceed all possible bounds of decency and must be regarded as\n\natrocious, utterly intolerable in a civilized community\"; 3) SAE's\n\nactions caused Fiacco emotional distress; and 4) Fiacco's emotional\n\ndistress was so severe that no reasonable person could be expected\n\nto endure it.   Curtis v. Porter, 784 A.2d 18, 22-23 (Me. 2001)\n\n(internal quotation omitted);    accord Wytrwal v. Saco Sch. Bd., 70\n\nF.3d 165, 173 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n          In order to \"give adequate 'breathing space' to the\n\nfreedoms protected by the First Amendment,\" the Supreme Court has\n\nestablished an additional requisite for IIED recovery where the\n\ndistress is alleged to have been caused by published speech: public\n\nofficials and public figures may only recover if they can prove\n\nthat the publication that harmed them contained a false statement\n\nof fact that was made with actual malice.       Hustler Magazine v.\n\nFalwell, 485 U.S. 46, 56 (1988); accord Mandel v. Boston Phoenix,\n\nInc., 456 F.3d 198, 201 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting New York Times Co.\n\nv. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 279-80 (1964)).      We now revisit the\n\ndistrict court's designation of Fiacco as a public official.\n\n                 1. Public Official\n\n          Identifying a public official for the purpose of applying\n\nthe actual malice standard is not an unequivocal process.       Not\n\nevery public employee is a public official, Hutchinson v. Proxmire,\n\n443 U.S. 111, 119 n.8 (1979), but it is not clear \"how far down\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\finto the lower ranks of government employees\" the designation\n\nextends, New York Times, 376 U.S. at 284 n.23.    Only those public\n\nemployees with \"substantial responsibility for or control over the\n\nconduct of governmental affairs,\" however, should be considered\n\npublic officials.   See Rosenblatt v. Baer, 383 U.S. 75, 85 (1966).\n\n          This Circuit has devised a three-part test to identify\n\npublic officials in the libel context.     We now apply this test to\n\nFiacco's IIED claim as it too stems from a published statement that\n\nis alleged to have caused harm.       A public official, then, is a\n\nperson who 1) holds a position of influence over issues of public\n\nimportance, as defined by the position's inherent attributes; 2)\n\nhas special access to the media as a means of self-help; and 3)\n\nassumed the risk of diminished privacy upon taking on the position.\n\nMandel, 456 F.3d at 204.   Fiacco asserts that he does not qualify\n\nas a public official under any of these factors.       Our analysis\n\nunder Mandel, however, is heavily dependent on the facts averred\n\nand our thorough review of the record leads to the conclusion that\n\nFiacco does warrant this designation.\n\n          The inherent attributes of Fiacco's position as Director\n\nof the Office of Community Standards demonstrate that he exercises\n\ninfluence over issues of public importance.    The goings-on   inside\n\na state university are of interest to the public because state\n\ncolleges such as UMO are funded with tax revenue, and it is to be\n\nexpected that the public will want to know how its money is being\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fmanaged and spent.     See Kassel v. Gannett Co., Inc., 875 F.2d 935,\n\n940 (1st Cir. 1989) (stating that taxpayers have a general interest\n\nin   the   oversight   of   any   publicly-funded    employment).       While\n\nFiacco's office might address issues as mundane as the enforcement\n\nof dorm quiet hours, it is also responsible for the handling of\n\nmuch more sensitive situations such as allegations of date rape and\n\nhazing. These types of matters are of clear public importance and,\n\nas the office director, Fiacco has a strong influence over the\n\nhandling of such matters because he sets the policies and either\n\nadjudicates    or   picks   the   adjudicators   who   will   address    such\n\ngrievances.    The first Mandel factor therefore weighs in favor of\n\nfinding Fiacco to be a public official.\n\n            As the Director of the Office of Community Standards,\n\nFiacco also has special access to the media as a means of self-\n\nhelp. As the record reveals, between October 2001 and October 2002\n\n-- before and during the investigation of Maine Alpha -- Fiacco was\n\nmentioned by name in eleven newspaper articles appearing in The\n\nMaine Campus and the Bangor Daily News.             All of these articles\n\nrecognized Fiacco as the director of the UMO Office of Community\n\nStandards or its predecessor, the Office of Judicial Affairs.             In\n\nsome articles Fiacco was quoted speaking on behalf of his office on\n\nthe UMO student code of conduct and other university policies. One\n\narticle even noted that Fiacco had been sought for comment, but had\n\ndeclined to speak.     It is apparent, then, that Fiacco had special\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\faccess to the media beyond that of an ordinary person; therefore,\n\nfaced with the Sexton Group's mailing, had he wished to defend his\n\nreputation in public, the media would likely have covered his\n\nstory.   See Gertz, 418 U.S. at 344 (\"Public officials and public\n\nfigures usually enjoy significantly greater access to the channels\n\nof   effective   communication      and    hence   have   a    more   realistic\n\nopportunity to counteract false statements than private individuals\n\nnormally enjoy\").      The second factor also supports designation as\n\na public official.      Cf. Kassel, 875 F.2d at 941 (finding that a\n\nstaff psychologist at a Veterans' Administration hospital was not\n\na public official and did not have special access to the media\n\nbecause, among other reasons, his duties did not include answering\n\npress inquiries).\n\n           The third factor, whether Fiacco assumed a risk of\n\ndiminished   privacy    when   he   became   Director     of   the    Office    of\n\nCommunity Standards, also leads to this conclusion. As highlighted\n\nin the preceding analysis, Fiacco could and should have anticipated\n\nthat some of the sensitive topics and situations handled by his\n\noffice would attract public attention.              Because the public is\n\ninterested in such matters, it is also interested in Fiacco as the\n\nperson adjudicating them and/or setting the policies and procedures\n\nby which they will be adjudicated.            Such an interest should be\n\nexpected to extend into Fiacco's personal life insofar as such\n\nmatters might indicate Fiacco's fitness to assume this task.                   See\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fGarrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 64, 77 (1964) (\"The public-official\n\nrule protects the paramount public interest in a free flow of\n\ninformation   to    the    people   concerning   public   officials,    their\n\nservants. To this end, anything which might touch on an official's\n\nfitness for office is relevant.\"). Indeed, Fiacco's departure from\n\nthe position of Director of Public Safety at Fort Lewis College --\n\na departure precipitated by a personal matter reflecting Fiacco's\n\nfitness to hold that office, and which was reported in the local\n\nmedia -- must have served to put Fiacco on notice that holding a\n\ndirectorial position in a college office of student conduct and\n\nsafety entails a risk of diminished personal privacy.\n\n          Based on our analysis of the three Mandel factors, then,\n\nFiacco qualifies as a public official and must meet the actual\n\nmalice standard in order to recover for his IIED cause of action.\n\nAs Fiacco is a public official, we need not reach the question of\n\nwhether he is also a public figure.\n\n                     2. Actual Malice\n\n          The      First   Amendment    requires   Fiacco,   as   a    public\n\nofficial, to prove that the Sexton Group's mailing contained a\n\nfalse statement of fact and was made with actual malice.               Actual\n\nmalice means that the offending party published a statement about\n\nthe plaintiff \"with knowledge that the statement was false or with\n\nreckless disregard as to whether or not it was true.\"                 Hustler\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fMagazine, 485 U.S. at 56; accord Mandel, 456 F.3d at 201 (quoting\n\nNew York Times, 376 U.S. at 279-80).\n\n           Regarding       the    requirement    of     identifying     a    false\n\nstatement of fact, Fiacco does not dispute the truth of the court\n\ndocuments and newspaper articles included in the Sexton Group's\n\nmailing.   Instead,    Fiacco      only    challenges    the   Sexton       Group's\n\ncharacterization      of    his    legal     troubles     in   the    anonymous\n\nmemorandum.2   Specifically, he asserts that 1) he was not convicted\n\nof \"DWI,\" 2) he did not commit sexual harassment, and 3) he did not\n\nengage in domestic violence. We address each of Fiacco's arguments\n\nin turn.\n\n           On Fiacco's first claim, that he was never convicted of\n\n\"DWI\" or Driving While Intoxicated but only of \"DWAI\" or Driving\n\nWhile Ability Impaired, we first acknowledge that under Colorado\n\nlaw -- the state where the offense took place -- the only two\n\ndrinking and driving offenses for which Fiacco could have been\n\nconvicted are DWAI and Driving Under the Influence (\"DUI\").                    See\n\nColo. Rev. Stat. § 42-4-1301(1) (2007).          As such, Fiacco could not\n\ntechnically have been convicted of DWI as indicated by the Sexton\n\n\n2\n    That memorandum reads as follows:\n\n           Enclosed please find newspaper articles and\n           court   documents   detailing  Mr.   Fiacco's\n           previous legal difficulties: DWI, Sexual\n           harassment, and Domestic Violence.    Is this\n           honestly the best qualified candidate the\n           University of Maine could find for the Office\n           of Judicial Affairs?\n\n                                      -11-\n\fGroup's memo.         This discrepancy is of little import however,\n\nbecause DWI and DUI are essentially interchangeable terms in that\n\nthey both indicate that the defendant attempted to drive a vehicle\n\nwith an elevated amount of alcohol or drugs in his system so that\n\nsuch activity was illegal and unsafe.             This is also the essence of\n\na DWAI conviction.       See id. at § 42-4-1301(1)(g).           It is for this\n\nreason that Fiacco's attempt to distinguish between DWAI and DUI\n\nbased   on   the     blood    alcohol   content     level    required    for   each\n\nconviction -- between 0.05 and 0.08 for DWAI; 0.08 or above for\n\nDUI; id. at § 42-4-1301(6)(a) -- falls flat; more so because\n\nFiacco's blood alcohol level at the time of this incident was 0.89\n\npercent.     Thus the memorandum's assertion that Fiacco had previous\n\nlegal difficulties with DWI is not a false statement of fact.                    See\n\nMasson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc., 501 U.S. 496, 517 (1991)\n\n(\"Minor inaccuracies do not amount to falsity so long as the\n\nsubstance,     the    gist,    the   sting,    of   the     libelous    charge    be\n\njustified.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n             Fiacco's second claim, that he has never been the subject\n\nof sexual harassment allegations or charges, also borders on the\n\ndisingenuous. Fiacco admits, and the mailed court records confirm,\n\nthat he was involved in a dispute with a former girlfriend who\n\nultimately secured a restraining order against him under the\n\nColorado Domestic Abuse Act, formerly Colorado Revised Statutes\n\n§§ 14-4-101 et seq. (2004).

The district court granted SAE summary judgment on Fiacco's intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, and Fiacco now contests this order. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>This action is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment, therefore we recite the facts in the light most favorable to Fiacco as non-movant. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Franceschi v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</i> 514 F.3d 81, 84 (1st Cir.2008). Fiacco was the Director of the Office of Community Standards, Rights and Responsibilities (\"Office of Community Standards\") at the University of Maine at Orono (\"UMO\"). In this capacity, Fiacco oversaw the student discipline process at UMO: he reviewed allegations of misconduct; assigned case managers to handle grievances; referred cases to UMO administrators or the Conduct Committee for adjudication; and occasionally adjudicated cases himself, subject to review by the Conduct Committee. Fiacco also developed policy statements concerning the student code of conduct and his office, and he answered questions on such matters from members of the UMO community.</p>\n<p>In 2002, Fiacco's office started investigating Maine Alpha for misconduct. In response, a group of current and former Maine Alpha members led by Jay Sexton <span class=\"star-pagination\">*98</span> (collectively, \"the Sexton Group\") hired a private investigator to uncover evidence of any bias Fiacco might hold against SAE or fraternities in general. The investigator found several court records and newspaper articles dating back to Fiacco's college years. Those documents revealed Fiacco's past involvement in two legal proceedings: a conviction for Driving While Ability Impaired (\"DWAI\") that resulted in his departure from the post of Director of Public Safety at Fort Lewis College in Colorado, and a temporary restraining order secured against him by a former girlfriend. The documents gave no indication that Fiacco was biased against fraternities or, in particular, SAE.</p>\n<p>The Sexton Group made copies of these documents and assembled them into packages containing the following unsigned memorandum:</p>\n<blockquote>Enclosed please find newspaper articles and court documents detailing Mr. Fiacco's previous legal difficulties: DWI, Sexual harassment, and Domestic Violence. Is this honestly the best qualified candidate the University of Maine could find for the <i>Office of Judicial Affairs?</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The packages were addressed to the University of Maine System Board of Trustees, UMO President Peter S. Hoff, several UMO deans and two local newspapers, the <i>Bangor Daily News</i> and <i>The Maine Campus.</i> They were placed in a box and mailed to a Maine Alpha alumnus in Colorado, who then anonymously sent the packages to the intended recipients.</p>\n<p>Fiacco asserts that the disclosure of this information and the surreptitious manner in which it was disseminated caused him great distress. As a result he became depressed and withdrawn, and his concentration and work performance suffered. He also experienced bouts of insomnia, nightmares, and teeth-grinding, and had to obtain psychological counseling.</p>\n<p>On September 19, 2005, Fiacco brought suit against SAE asserting, <i>inter alia,</i> intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\"). Federal subject-matter jurisdiction was established through the diversity of the parties' citizenship. On October 12, 2006, SAE moved for summary judgment and  with the benefit of extensive discovery, oral argument, and additional briefing  the district court granted this motion on April 5, 2007. The district court found that Fiacco was both a public official and a limited-purpose public figure; hence Fiacco's IIED claim failed because he was unable to prove that the memorandum included in the Sexton Group's packages contained a statement of fact made with actual malice. <i>See </i><i>Fiacco v. Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity,</i> 484 F.Supp.2d 158, 175 (D.Me.2007).<sup>[1]</sup> Fiacco now appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>Summary judgment is appropriate when the record shows that \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We review the grant of such a motion <i>de novo. </i><i>GTE Wireless, Inc. v. Cellexis Int'l, Inc.,</i> 341 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2003). In doing so, we are obliged to \"view the entire record in the light most hospitable to the party opposing summary judgment, indulging all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.\" <i>Griggs-Ryan v. Smith,</i> 904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir.1990). Nonetheless, we ignore \"`conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.'\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*99</span> <i>Suárez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> 229 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir.2000) (citing <i>Medina-Muñoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,</i> 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1990)). With specific regard to Fiacco's IIED claim, whether a plaintiff is a public official or public figure is an issue of law that we review <i>de novo. </i><i>Dixon v. Int'l Bhd. of Police Officers,</i> 504 F.3d 73, 87-88 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</h2>\n<p>Under Maine law, Fiacco's IIED claim survives summary judgment if the facts establish that: 1) SAE intentionally or recklessly inflicted severe emotional distress or was certain or substantially certain that such distress would result from its conduct; 2) SAE's conduct was \"so extreme and outrageous as to exceed all possible bounds of decency and must be regarded as atrocious, utterly intolerable in a civilized community\"; 3) SAE's actions caused Fiacco emotional distress; and 4) Fiacco's emotional distress was so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it. <i>Curtis v. Porter,</i> 784 A.2d 18, 22-23 (Me.2001) (internal quotation omitted); <i>accord </i><i>Wytrwal v. Saco Sch. Bd.,</i> 70 F.3d 165, 173 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>In order to \"give adequate `breathing space' to the freedoms protected by the First Amendment,\" the Supreme Court has established an additional requisite for IIED recovery where the distress is alleged to have been caused by published speech: public officials and public figures may only recover if they can prove that the publication that harmed them contained a false statement of fact that was made with actual malice. <i>Hustler Magazine v. Falwell,</i> 485 U.S. 46, 56, 108 S.Ct. 876, 99 L.Ed.2d 41 (1988); <i>accord </i><i>Mandel v. Boston Phoenix, Inc.,</i> 456 F.3d 198, 201 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</i> 376 U.S. 254, 279-80, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964)). We now revisit the district court's designation of Fiacco as a public official.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Public Official</h2>\n<p>Identifying a public official for the purpose of applying the actual malice standard is not an unequivocal process. Not every public employee is a public official, <i>Hutchinson v. Proxmire,</i> 443 U.S. 111, 119 n. 8, 99 S.Ct. 2675, 61 L.Ed.2d 411 (1979), but it is not clear \"how far down into the lower ranks of government employees\" the designation extends, <i>New York Times,</i> 376 U.S. at 284 n. 23, 84 S.Ct. 710. Only those public employees with \"substantial responsibility for or control over the conduct of governmental affairs,\" however, should be considered public officials. <i>See </i><i>Rosenblatt v. Baer,</i> 383 U.S. 75, 85, 86 S.Ct. 669, 15 L.Ed.2d 597 (1966).</p>\n<p>This Circuit has devised a three-part test to identify public officials in the libel context. We now apply this test to Fiacco's IIED claim as it too stems from a published statement that is alleged to have caused harm. A public official, then, is a person who 1) holds a position of influence over issues of public importance, as defined by the position's inherent attributes; 2) has special access to the media as a means of self-help; and 3) assumed the risk of diminished privacy upon taking on the position. <i>Mandel,</i> 456 F.3d at 204. Fiacco asserts that he does not qualify as a public official under any of these factors. Our analysis under <i>Mandel,</i> however, is heavily dependent on the facts averred and our thorough review of the record leads to the conclusion that Fiacco does warrant this designation.</p>\n<p>The inherent attributes of Fiacco's position as Director of the Office of Community Standards demonstrate that he exercises influence over issues of public importance. The goings-on inside a state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*100</span> university are of interest to the public because state colleges such as UMO are funded with tax revenue, and it is to be expected that the public will want to know how its money is being managed and spent. <i>See </i><i>Kassel v. Gannett Co., Inc.,</i> 875 F.2d 935, 940 (1st Cir.1989) (stating that taxpayers have a general interest in the oversight of any publicly-funded employment). While Fiacco's office might address issues as mundane as the enforcement of dorm quiet hours, it is also responsible for the handling of much more sensitive situations such as allegations of date rape and hazing. These types of matters are of clear public importance and, as the office director, Fiacco has a strong influence over the handling of such matters because he sets the policies and either adjudicates or picks the adjudicators who will address such grievances. The first <i>Mandel</i> factor therefore weighs in favor of finding Fiacco to be a public official.</p>\n<p>As the Director of the Office of Community Standards, Fiacco also has special access to the media as a means of self-help. As the record reveals, between October 2001 and October 2002  before and during the investigation of Maine Alpha  Fiacco was mentioned by name in eleven newspaper articles appearing in <i>The Maine Campus</i> and the <i>Bangor Daily News.</i> All of these articles recognized Fiacco as the director of the UMO Office of Community Standards or its predecessor, the Office of Judicial Affairs. In some articles Fiacco was quoted speaking on behalf of his office on the UMO student code of conduct and other university policies. One article even noted that Fiacco had been sought for comment, but had declined to speak. It is apparent, then, that Fiacco had special access to the media beyond that of an ordinary person; therefore, faced with the Sexton Group's mailing, had he wished to defend his reputation in public, the media would likely have covered his story. <i>See Gertz,</i> 418 U.S. at 344, 94 S.Ct. 2997 (\"Public officials and public figures usually enjoy significantly greater access to the channels of effective communication and hence have a more realistic opportunity to counteract false statements than private individuals normally enjoy\"). The second factor also supports designation as a public official. <i>Cf. </i><i>Kassel,</i> 875 F.2d at 941 (finding that a staff psychologist at a Veterans' Administration hospital was not a public official and did not have special access to the media because, among other reasons, his duties did not include answering press inquiries).</p>\n<p>The third factor, whether Fiacco assumed a risk of diminished privacy when he became Director of the Office of Community Standards, also leads to this conclusion. As highlighted in the preceding analysis, Fiacco could and should have anticipated that some of the sensitive topics and situations handled by his office would attract public attention. Because the public is interested in such matters, it is also interested in Fiacco as the person adjudicating them and/or setting the policies and procedures by which they will be adjudicated. Such an interest should be expected to extend into Fiacco's personal life insofar as such matters might indicate Fiacco's fitness to assume this task. <i>See </i><i>Garrison v. Louisiana,</i> 379 U.S. 64, 77, 85 S.Ct. 209, 13 L.Ed.2d 125 (1964) (\"The public-official rule protects the paramount public interest in a free flow of information to the people concerning public officials, their servants. To this end, anything which might touch on an official's fitness for office is relevant.\"). Indeed, Fiacco's departure from the position of Director of Public Safety at Fort Lewis College  a departure precipitated by a personal matter reflecting Fiacco's fitness to hold that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*101</span> office, and which was reported in the local media  must have served to put Fiacco on notice that holding a directorial position in a college office of student conduct and safety entails a risk of diminished personal privacy.</p>\n<p>Based on our analysis of the three <i>Mandel</i> factors, then, Fiacco qualifies as a public official and must meet the actual malice standard in order to recover for his IIED cause of action. As Fiacco is a public official, we need not reach the question of whether he is also a public figure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Actual Malice</h2>\n<p>The First Amendment requires Fiacco, as a public official, to prove that the Sexton Group's mailing contained a false statement of fact and was made with actual malice. Actual malice means that the offending party published a statement about the plaintiff \"with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard as to whether or not it was true.\" <i>Hustler Magazine,</i> 485 U.S. at 56, 108 S.Ct. 876; <i>accord </i><i>Mandel,</i> 456 F.3d at 201 (quoting <i>New York Times,</i> 376 U.S. at 279-80, 84 S.Ct. 710).</p>\n<p>Regarding the requirement of identifying a false statement of fact, Fiacco does not dispute the truth of the court documents and newspaper articles included in the Sexton Group's mailing. Instead, Fiacco only challenges the Sexton Group's characterization of his legal troubles in the anonymous memorandum.<sup>[2]</sup> Specifically, he asserts that 1) he was not convicted of \"DWI,\" 2) he did not commit sexual harassment, and 3) he did not engage in domestic violence. We address each of Fiacco's arguments in turn.</p>\n<p>On Fiacco's first claim, that he was never convicted of \"DWI\" or Driving While Intoxicated but only of \"DWAI\" or Driving While Ability Impaired, we first acknowledge that under Colorado law  the state where the offense took place  the only two drinking and driving offenses for which Fiacco could have been convicted are DWAI and Driving Under the Influence (\"DUI\"). <i>See</i> Colo.Rev.Stat. § 42-4-1301(1) (2007). As such, Fiacco could not technically have been convicted of DWI as indicated by the Sexton Group's memo. This discrepancy is of little import however, because DWI and DUI are essentially interchangeable terms in that they both indicate that the defendant attempted to drive a vehicle with an elevated amount of alcohol or drugs in his system so that such activity was illegal and unsafe. This is also the essence of a DWAI conviction. <i>See id.</i> at § 42-4-1301(1)(g). It is for this reason that Fiacco's attempt to distinguish between DWAI and DUI based on the blood alcohol content level required for each conviction  between 0.05 and 0.08 for DWAI; 0.08 or above for DUI; <i>id.</i> at § 42-4-1301(6)(a)  falls flat; more so because Fiacco's blood alcohol level at the time of this incident was 0.89 percent. Thus the memorandum's assertion that Fiacco had previous legal difficulties with DWI is not a false statement of fact. <i>See </i><i>Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc.,</i> 501 U.S. 496, 517, 111 S.Ct. 2419, 115 L.Ed.2d 447 (1991) (\"Minor inaccuracies do not amount to falsity so long as the substance, the gist, the sting, of the libelous charge be justified.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>Fiacco's second claim, that he has never been the subject of sexual harassment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*102</span> allegations or charges, also borders on the disingenuous. Fiacco admits, and the mailed court records confirm, that he was involved in a dispute with a former girlfriend who ultimately secured a restraining order against him under the Colorado Domestic Abuse Act, formerly Colorado Revised Statutes §§ 14-4-101 <i>et seq.</i> (2004). Court documents related to those proceedings reveal Fiacco's acknowledgment that his actions towards his former girlfriend \"may have crossed the line into harassing behavior.\" As such, the Sexton Group memorandum's statement that Fiacco has had legal difficulties with sexual harassment is not false.</p>\n<p>Regarding Fiacco's third and final claim, we believe the memorandum's statement that Fiacco has had legal difficulties with domestic violence is validated by the text of the permanent restraining order secured by Fiacco's former girlfriend, which reads: \"THE COURT FINDS ... that you [Fiacco] have committed an act of violence against the plaintiff, or have threatened to do so.\"<sup>[3]</sup> This alone is enough to establish that the memorandum's statement is not a false statement of fact. Contrary to Fiacco's assertions, a conviction for domestic violence is not required to make this statement true.</p>\n<p>As Fiacco is unable to prove that the offensive memorandum included a false statement of fact, he fails to meet the first prong of the actual malice standard applicable to him as a public official. We need go no further to address whether the Sexton Group acted with actual malice. Fiacco is unable to meet the requirements of the IIED cause of action and cannot recover damages. The district court's grant of summary judgment to SAE was proper.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the district court's judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  For the purpose of summary judgment the district court chose not to draw a distinction between SAE, the national fraternity, and the Sexton Group or Maine Alpha. In this opinion we do likewise.</p>\n<p>[2]  That memorandum reads as follows:\n</p>\n<p>Enclosed please find newspaper articles and court documents detailing Mr. Fiacco's previous legal difficulties: DWI, Sexual harassment, and Domestic Violence. Is this honestly the best qualified candidate the University of Maine could find for the <i>Office of Judicial Affairs?</i></p>\n<p>[3]  Though this order was later vacated on appeal, the appellate court did not disturb the trial court's finding that Fiacco had committed an act of domestic violence.</p>\n\n</div>",

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span> (1964)). We now revisit the district court's designation of Fiacco as a public official.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Public Official</h2>\n<p>Identifying a public official for the purpose of applying the actual malice standard is not an unequivocal process. Not every public employee is a public official, <i>Hutchinson v. Proxmire,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110131\"><a href=\"/opinion/110131/hutchinson-v-proxmire/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span>, 119 n. 8, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110131\"><a href=\"/opinion/110131/hutchinson-v-proxmire/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span> (1979), but it is not clear \"how far down into the lower ranks of government employees\" the designation extends, <i>New York Times,</i> 376 U.S. at 284 n. 23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106761\"><a href=\"/opinion/106761/new-york-times-co-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span>. Only those public employees with \"substantial responsibility for or control over the conduct of governmental affairs,\" however, should be considered public officials. <i>See </i><i>Rosenblatt v. Baer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107163\"><a href=\"/opinion/107163/rosenblatt-v-baer/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 85, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107163\"><a href=\"/opinion/107163/rosenblatt-v-baer/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span> (1966).</p>\n<p>This Circuit has devised a three-part test to identify public officials in the libel context. We now apply this test to Fiacco's IIED claim as it too stems from a published statement that is alleged to have caused harm. A public official, then, is a person who 1) holds a position of influence over issues of public importance, as defined by the position's inherent attributes; 2) has special access to the media as a means of self-help; and 3) assumed the risk of diminished privacy upon taking on the position. <i>Mandel,</i> 456 F.3d at 204. Fiacco asserts that he does not qualify as a public official under any of these factors. Our analysis under <i>Mandel,</i> however, is heavily dependent on the facts averred and our thorough review of the record leads to the conclusion that Fiacco does warrant this designation.</p>\n<p>The inherent attributes of Fiacco's position as Director of the Office of Community Standards demonstrate that he exercises influence over issues of public importance. The goings-on inside a state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*100</span> university are of interest to the public because state colleges such as UMO are funded with tax revenue, and it is to be expected that the public will want to know how its money is being managed and spent. <i>See </i><i>Kassel v. Gannett Co., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524049\"><a href=\"/opinion/524049/jeffrey-kassel-v-gannett-co-inc-dba-usa-today/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">935</span></a></span>, 940 (1st Cir.1989) (stating that taxpayers have a general interest in the oversight of any publicly-funded employment). While Fiacco's office might address issues as mundane as the enforcement of dorm quiet hours, it is also responsible for the handling of much more sensitive situations such as allegations of date rape and hazing. These types of matters are of clear public importance and, as the office director, Fiacco has a strong influence over the handling of such matters because he sets the policies and either adjudicates or picks the adjudicators who will address such grievances. The first <i>Mandel</i> factor therefore weighs in favor of finding Fiacco to be a public official.</p>\n<p>As the Director of the Office of Community Standards, Fiacco also has special access to the media as a means of self-help. As the record reveals, between October 2001 and October 2002  before and during the investigation of Maine Alpha  Fiacco was mentioned by name in eleven newspaper articles appearing in <i>The Maine Campus</i> and the <i>Bangor Daily News.</i> All of these articles recognized Fiacco as the director of the UMO Office of Community Standards or its predecessor, the Office of Judicial Affairs. In some articles Fiacco was quoted speaking on behalf of his office on the UMO student code of conduct and other university policies. One article even noted that Fiacco had been sought for comment, but had declined to speak. It is apparent, then, that Fiacco had special access to the media beyond that of an ordinary person; therefore, faced with the Sexton Group's mailing, had he wished to defend his reputation in public, the media would likely have covered his story. <i>See Gertz,</i> 418 U.S. at 344, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109091\"><a href=\"/opinion/109091/gertz-v-robert-welch-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2997</span></a></span> (\"Public officials and public figures usually enjoy significantly greater access to the channels of effective communication and hence have a more realistic opportunity to counteract false statements than private individuals normally enjoy\"). The second factor also supports designation as a public official. <i>Cf. </i><i>Kassel,</i> 875 F.2d at 941 (finding that a staff psychologist at a Veterans' Administration hospital was not a public official and did not have special access to the media because, among other reasons, his duties did not include answering press inquiries).</p>\n<p>The third factor, whether Fiacco assumed a risk of diminished privacy when he became Director of the Office of Community Standards, also leads to this conclusion. As highlighted in the preceding analysis, Fiacco could and should have anticipated that some of the sensitive topics and situations handled by his office would attract public attention. Because the public is interested in such matters, it is also interested in Fiacco as the person adjudicating them and/or setting the policies and procedures by which they will be adjudicated. Such an interest should be expected to extend into Fiacco's personal life insofar as such matters might indicate Fiacco's fitness to assume this task. <i>See </i><i>Garrison v. Louisiana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106935\"><a href=\"/opinion/106935/garrison-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 77, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106935\"><a href=\"/opinion/106935/garrison-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106935\"><a href=\"/opinion/106935/garrison-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span> (1964) (\"The public-official rule protects the paramount public interest in a free flow of information to the people concerning public officials, their servants. To this end, anything which might touch on an official's fitness for office is relevant.\"). Indeed, Fiacco's departure from the position of Director of Public Safety at Fort Lewis College  a departure precipitated by a personal matter reflecting Fiacco's fitness to hold that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*101</span> office, and which was reported in the local media  must have served to put Fiacco on notice that holding a directorial position in a college office of student conduct and safety entails a risk of diminished personal privacy.</p>\n<p>Based on our analysis of the three <i>Mandel</i> factors, then, Fiacco qualifies as a public official and must meet the actual malice standard in order to recover for his IIED cause of action. As Fiacco is a public official, we need not reach the question of whether he is also a public figure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Actual Malice</h2>\n<p>The First Amendment requires Fiacco, as a public official, to prove that the Sexton Group's mailing contained a false statement of fact and was made with actual malice. Actual malice means that the offending party published a statement about the plaintiff \"with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard as to whether or not it was true.\" <i>Hustler Magazine,</i> 485 U.S. at 56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112011\"><a href=\"/opinion/112011/hustler-magazine-inc-v-falwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span>; <i>accord </i><i>Mandel,</i> 456 F.3d at 201 (quoting <i>New York Times,</i> 376 U.S. at 279-80, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106761\"><a href=\"/opinion/106761/new-york-times-co-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span>).</p>\n<p>Regarding the requirement of identifying a false statement of fact, Fiacco does not dispute the truth of the court documents and newspaper articles included in the Sexton Group's mailing. Instead, Fiacco only challenges the Sexton Group's characterization of his legal troubles in the anonymous memorandum.<sup>[2]</sup> Specifically, he asserts that 1) he was not convicted of \"DWI,\" 2) he did not commit sexual harassment, and 3) he did not engage in domestic violence. We address each of Fiacco's arguments in turn.</p>\n<p>On Fiacco's first claim, that he was never convicted of \"DWI\" or Driving While Intoxicated but only of \"DWAI\" or Driving While Ability Impaired, we first acknowledge that under Colorado law  the state where the offense took place  the only two drinking and driving offenses for which Fiacco could have been convicted are DWAI and Driving Under the Influence (\"DUI\"). <i>See</i> Colo.Rev.Stat. § 42-4-1301(1) (2007). As such, Fiacco could not technically have been convicted of DWI as indicated by the Sexton Group's memo. This discrepancy is of little import however, because DWI and DUI are essentially interchangeable terms in that they both indicate that the defendant attempted to drive a vehicle with an elevated amount of alcohol or drugs in his system so that such activity was illegal and unsafe. This is also the essence of a DWAI conviction. <i>See id.</i> at § 42-4-1301(1)(g). It is for this reason that Fiacco's attempt to distinguish between DWAI and DUI based on the blood alcohol content level required for each conviction  between 0.05 and 0.08 for DWAI; 0.08 or above for DUI; <i>id.</i> at § 42-4-1301(6)(a)  falls flat; more so because Fiacco's blood alcohol level at the time of this incident was 0.89 percent. Thus the memorandum's assertion that Fiacco had previous legal difficulties with DWI is not a false statement of fact. <i>See </i><i>Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112633\"><a href=\"/opinion/112633/masson-v-new-yorker-magazine-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span>, 517, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112633\"><a href=\"/opinion/112633/masson-v-new-yorker-magazine-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2419</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112633\"><a href=\"/opinion/112633/masson-v-new-yorker-magazine-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span> (1991) (\"Minor inaccuracies do not amount to falsity so long as the substance, the gist, the sting, of the libelous charge be justified.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>Fiacco's second claim, that he has never been the subject of sexual harassment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*102</span> allegations or charges, also borders on the disingenuous. Fiacco admits, and the mailed court records confirm, that he was involved in a dispute with a former girlfriend who ultimately secured a restraining order against him under the Colorado Domestic Abuse Act, formerly Colorado Revised Statutes §§ 14-4-101 <i>et seq.</i> (2004). Court documents related to those proceedings reveal Fiacco's acknowledgment that his actions towards his former girlfriend \"may have crossed the line into harassing behavior.\" As such, the Sexton Group memorandum's statement that Fiacco has had legal difficulties with sexual harassment is not false.</p>\n<p>Regarding Fiacco's third and final claim, we believe the memorandum's statement that Fiacco has had legal difficulties with domestic violence is validated by the text of the permanent restraining order secured by Fiacco's former girlfriend, which reads: \"THE COURT FINDS ... that you [Fiacco] have committed an act of violence against the plaintiff, or have threatened to do so.\"<sup>[3]</sup> This alone is enough to establish that the memorandum's statement is not a false statement of fact. Contrary to Fiacco's assertions, a conviction for domestic violence is not required to make this statement true.</p>\n<p>As Fiacco is unable to prove that the offensive memorandum included a false statement of fact, he fails to meet the first prong of the actual malice standard applicable to him as a public official. We need go no further to address whether the Sexton Group acted with actual malice. Fiacco is unable to meet the requirements of the IIED cause of action and cannot recover damages. The district court's grant of summary judgment to SAE was proper.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the district court's judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  For the purpose of summary judgment the district court chose not to draw a distinction between SAE, the national fraternity, and the Sexton Group or Maine Alpha. In this opinion we do likewise.</p>\n<p>[2]  That memorandum reads as follows:\n</p>\n<p>Enclosed please find newspaper articles and court documents detailing Mr. Fiacco's previous legal difficulties: DWI, Sexual harassment, and Domestic Violence. Is this honestly the best qualified candidate the University of Maine could find for the <i>Office of Judicial Affairs?</i></p>\n<p>[3]  Though this order was later vacated on appeal, the appellate court did not disturb the trial court's finding that Fiacco had committed an act of domestic violence.</p>\n\n</div>",
