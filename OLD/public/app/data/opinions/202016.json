Paul James Hansen was convicted\n\nafter a jury trial in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts for his role in stealing a minivan and\n\nhis responsibility for the armed robbery and killing that followed.\n\nHe now appeals both his conviction and sentence, bringing no less\n\nthan eleven claims of error.      After careful review, we affirm.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n            We begin with an overview of the facts of this case, in\n\nthe light most favorable to the Government as the prevailing party.\n\nThe    unfortunate   friendship   of      Hansen   and   Brendan   Brennan\n\n(“Brennan”) spawned from their childhood association with the Boys’\n\nClub in Charlestown, Massachusetts, when the two were about twelve\n\nyears old.    During their teen years, they became friendly with an\n\nolder man from the neighborhood, Scott Sheehan (“Sheehan”), who\n\nmade money by robbing banks.       Sheehan instructed his two young\n\napprentices about various aspects of the criminal trade, including\n\nthe finer points of stealing cars.        Under Sheehan’s tutelage, the\n\nyoung men learned, for example, that to prevent police detection\n\nwhen stealing vehicles that were to be used in robberies, they\n\nshould wear certain clothes such as nylon pants, long-sleeved\n\nshirts, hats, and gloves.\n\n            The pair wasted no time putting their newly acquired\n\nskills to use – between June, 1994 and the summer of 1996, Brennan\n\nwas involved in stealing approximately 100 cars, with Hansen\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fparticipating in roughly 65-70 of these thefts.1 Brennan’s budding\n\ncriminal career hit bumps in the road, however, when he was\n\narrested and convicted of four different auto thefts in 1995 and\n\n1996.\n\n            While Brennan was incarcerated for one of these auto\n\nthefts, Hansen continued to mingle with the wrong crowd, and\n\neventually learned of an upcoming criminal opportunity from a\n\nCharlestown acquaintance named John Fidler (“Fidler”). On July 25,\n\n1996, Hansen met up with Brennan, who had just been released from\n\njail, and told him that Fidler and two other individuals from\n\nCharlestown, Dennis Bird (“Bird”) and Billy McKillop (“McKillop”),\n\nwere planning to rob an armored truck and wanted Hansen to help out\n\nby stealing a minivan.      (A minivan was the vehicle of choice for\n\nsuch a venture because the sliding doors and removable seats\n\nconceal the robbers and allow for easy exit during the heat of a\n\nrobbery.)     According    to   Brennan,    Fidler    and     his    crew   were\n\napparently in the process of replacing another Charlestown group\n\nthat robbed armored trucks while that group was incarcerated for a\n\nrobbery in Hudson, New Hampshire, which had resulted in the death\n\nof two guards.\n\n            The   next   day,   Hansen,    Fidler,    Bird,    and    McKillop\n\nunsuccessfully tried to pilfer a minivan.            Having had difficulty\n\n\n        1\n       The stolen vehicles were primarily used for joy-riding,\nstripping and selling parts, or to help individuals commit\ninsurance fraud.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fstealing these types of vehicles in the past, Hansen asked the more\n\nadroit Brennan to lend a hand, with the understanding that both\n\nHansen and Brennan would be compensated for the theft.            Brennan\n\nunderstood that the minivan to be stolen was to be used in an\n\narmored truck robbery, firearms would be used during the robbery,\n\nand he and Hansen would earn more money if the robbery was\n\nsuccessful.\n\n              On the evening of July 27, 1996, Hansen and Brennan\n\ndonned nylon pants, long-sleeved shirts, and gloves and trolled the\n\nstreets of Charlestown for a suitable vehicle.          Before long, the\n\npair noticed an attractive white minivan with tinted windows.\n\nWhile Hansen kept watch, Brennan broke into the vehicle and started\n\nthe engine.       After stashing the stolen minivan in Somerville,\n\nMassachusetts, Hansen and Brennan showed Fidler and Bird their\n\nquarry.\n\n              Four days later, on July 31, 1996, a Dunbar armored truck\n\ndriven by Michael Day (“Day”) and Edward Kubera (“Kubera”) parked\n\nat the Twin City Plaza in Somerville to deliver currency to a Star\n\nMarket.   Kubera unloaded boxes of coins while Day remained in the\n\ntruck   and    watched   for   suspicious   activity.   While   they   were\n\nworking, a white minivan approached the armored truck with tires\n\nsquealing.      An individual dressed in a ski mask and gloves exited\n\nthe minivan, pointed a handgun at Day’s head, and instructed him to\n\nlie on the floor of the truck.        At the same time, another masked\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fman wearing gloves and dark clothes approached the armored truck\n\nwith an assault rifle and brutally shot Kubera in the chest.                The\n\nsecond   robber   climbed     over   Day   to    enter   the   armored   truck,\n\ncollected approximately $3,725, and took Day’s firearm.             The armed\n\nrobbers escaped as quickly as they had arrived, with the entire\n\nrobbery lasting only a few minutes.2            An hour later, Kubera died.\n\n           The    resulting    investigation       produced    statements    by\n\nBrennan explaining Hansen’s role in the robbery,3 as well as a\n\nconversation recorded by Brennan’s father, Stephen Brennan, in\n\nwhich Hansen admitted that Fidler had asked him to steal a vehicle.\n\nHansen was indicted on June 14, 2001 (nearly five years after the\n\nheist), on charges that he (1) aided and abetted robbery affecting\n\ncommerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 1951(a); (2) conspired\n\nto affect commerce by means of robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1951(a); (3) used a firearm during a crime of violence and\n\nthereby caused murder, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c), and\n\n924(j); and (4) made a false material declaration before a grand\n\n\n\n     2\n       Police found a white minivan near the Twin City Plaza with\ndamage to the door locks and steering column. It belonged to a\nBoston furniture store and its rear seats had been removed to\nfacilitate moving furniture.\n     3\n       Authorities had recorded Brennan talking about his role in\nthe theft of the minivan and the robbery of the armored truck and\narrested him on August 9, 1996. A jury convicted Brennan of aiding\nand abetting an armored car robbery, conspiring to rob an armored\ncar, and using a firearm during a crime of violence and thereby\ncausing a death. After being sentenced to a 320-month prison term,\nBrennan agreed to cooperate with authorities and implicated Hansen.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623.           At trial, the Government’s\n\ncase-in-chief was primarily based upon Brennan’s testimony, which\n\nlargely consisted of the factual account set forth above. The jury\n\nfound Hansen guilty on all counts.\n\n          Hansen     was   sentenced   on       October   9,   2002.    At   the\n\nsentencing hearing and in a subsequently filed Memorandum dated\n\nFebruary 14, 2003, the district court explained its findings.                The\n\ncourt grouped Counts 1, 2, and 4 together and determined a base\n\noffense level of 43 using the first degree murder guideline.                 See\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2A1.1.4     The court then departed downward to an offense\n\nlevel of 33 based upon Hansen’s state of mind.                  See U.S.S.G. §\n\n2A1.1 cmt. n.1 (“The extent of the departure should be based upon\n\nthe defendant’s state of mind (e.g., recklessness or negligence),\n\nthe degree of risk inherent in the conduct, and the nature of the\n\nunderlying   offense    conduct.”).         A    two-level     enhancement   for\n\nobstruction of justice was added because Hansen testified falsely\n\nbefore the grand jury, resulting in a total offense level of 35.\n\nSee U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2(c).       Because Hansen had a criminal history\n\ncategory of VI, the district court calculated Hansen’s guideline\n\nsentencing range to be 292 to 365 months.                 The court sentenced\n\nHansen to a 352-month term of imprisonment (292 months on counts 1,\n\n2, and 4 — the grouped counts — and a consecutive term of 60 months\n\n\n\n     4\n      Guideline citations are to the 2001 Guidelines Manual, which\nwas the version that applied at Hansen’s sentencing.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fon count 3).            Five years of supervised release and a restitution\n\npayment of $3,775 were also imposed.                 These appeals followed.5\n\nII. DISCUSSION\n\n                 Hansen appeals both his conviction and sentence, raising\n\nno less than eleven points of error.                 We address each challenge in\n\nturn, taking the sentencing issue first.\n\n                 A.     Booker Sentencing Issue\n\n                 Hansen’s first and main line of attack is the fact that\n\nthe   district          court    sentenced    him    under    the   prior   mandatory\n\nguideline regime.               See United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738\n\n(2005). Despite his claim to the contrary, however, Hansen did not\n\nargue       to        the   district    court       that     the    guidelines   were\n\nunconstitutional or that his sentence violated Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000); therefore, his Booker claim is not\n\npreserved and thus we review for plain error.                  See United States v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 77 (1st Cir. 2005). Under plain error\n\nreview, Hansen must show “(1) that an error occurred (2) which was\n\nclear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant’s\n\nsubstantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness,\n\n\n\n\n        5\n       Hansen filed a timely notice of appeal on March 3, 2003\nwhich was docketed in this court as No. 03-1331.        Thereafter,\nHansen filed a motion for new trial pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P.\n33, which the district court denied on January 25, 2005. Hansen\nthen filed another notice of appeal on March 7, 2005, which was\ndocketed in this court as No. 05-1414 and consolidated with No. 03-\n1331.\n\n                                             -7-\n\fintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.”           United\n\nStates v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n             Hansen is able to meet the first two elements because he\n\nwas    sentenced   under    a   mandatory    guideline    regime.       See\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 77.       The question is whether he is able\n\nto show a reasonable probability “that the sentencing court, freed\n\nof    the   shackles   forged   by   mandatory   guidelines,   would   have\n\nfashioned a more favorable sentence.” United States v. Guzman, 419\n\nF.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2005).         While we have said that we are not\n\n“overly demanding as to proof of probability,” United States v.\n\nHeldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir. 2005), the defendant “must\n\npoint to specific indicia” that reasonable probability exists.\n\nUnited States v. Sanchez-Berrios, 424 F.3d 65, 80 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             To support his claim that it is reasonably probable that\n\nsentencing under a non-mandatory system would have yielded a\n\ndifferent result, Hansen points to the following statement in the\n\ndistrict judge’s February 14, 2003 sentencing memorandum:\n\n             The defendant was 19. The people who enlisted\n             him in stealing the van were at least ten\n             years older, with a brutal reputation in\n             Charlestown.    While the law holds Hansen\n             responsible for the foreseeable consequence of\n             his acts, it is clear that his relationship to\n             the armored car robbery that resulted in the\n             tragic murder of Edward Kubera was tenuous.\n             He had, at most, only the most general idea of\n             the plans of Fidler and Bird. He did not know\n             when the robbery would take place, where, or\n             of whom. While Brennan suggests that Hansen\n             knew that guns would be involved - semi-\n             automatic guns at that - Hansen had no control\n\n                                     -8-\n\f           over how they would be brandished, or indeed,\n           whether they would be used at all.\n\nUnited States v. Hansen, 256 F. Supp. 2d 65, 72 (D. Mass. 2003).\n\nThese comments do suggest that the district judge was sympathetic\n\nto Hansen’s situation in light of the jury’s guilty verdict on\n\nCount 3, which held Hansen accountable for the shooting as a\n\n“foreseeable consequence of the use of a firearm in the course of\n\nthe conspiracy.” See Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 648\n\n(1946).    Scrutinized in the context of the entire memorandum,\n\nhowever, the court’s statements do little more than explain why it\n\nchose to depart downward to the second degree murder guideline\n\n(U.S.S.G. § 2A1.2 (base offense level of 33)) instead of using the\n\nfirst degree murder guideline (U.S.S.G. § 2A1.1 (base offense level\n\nof 43)).   Nothing in the judge’s comments imply that she would have\n\nimposed a different sentence had she been operating under an\n\nadvisory guideline regime.   In fact, a review of the entire record\n\nindicates just the opposite.     The district court explained:\n\n           In this area, the guidelines permit me to make\n           a more nuanced judgment as to what kind of\n           sentence Hansen deserves than the jury did.\n           The   jury   may  have   found   the   killing\n           “foreseeable” but I cannot conclude that it\n           was “intentional.” If there ever were a case\n           in which the downward departure to a second\n           degree murder guideline was appropriate, it is\n           this one.\n\nHansen, 256 F. Supp. 2d at 72.    Other comments by the court at the\n\nOctober 9, 2002 sentencing hearing indicate that to the extent the\n\njudge felt constrained, it was as a result of the jury’s guilty\n\n                                  -9-\n\fverdict on the conspiracy counts, not the mandatory guidelines.6\n\nIndeed, the judge’s comments indicate that she felt the mandatory\n\nguidelines allowed her room to craft an appropriate sentence based\n\nupon Hansen’s actual role and his state of mind.   This is critical\n\nbecause here, in contrast to the vast majority of cases, the\n\napplicable guidelines encourage the sentencing judge to choose the\n\nmost appropriate point along a spectrum, from first degree murder\n\n(level 43) to second degree murder (level 33)7 based upon an\n\nevaluation of state of mind. The judge exercised this authority by\n\nplacing the crime at the level she found appropriate (level 33).\n\n          But having exercised the authority to depart, the court\n\nalso made it clear that it would go no lower: “[t]here’s no way I’m\n\ngoing to go below a Level 33.”    It is also clear that the court\n\nbelieved Hansen played a greater role than Brennan in the offenses,\n\nand deserved a longer sentence than Brennan’s 320 months.   As the\n\njudge explained:\n\n               Based   on   the  relationship,  though,\n          between Mr. Brennan and Mr. Hansen, I agree\n          with the government that I will not give a\n          role adjustment to Mr. Hansen, one that Mr.\n          Brennan got.    I do think that, whatever Mr.\n          Brennan might have been involved in in any\n\n\n     6\n       There, the district court stated, “I don’t think that, given\nwhat the jury has found, that I have much leeway in the sentence.”\n(emphasis added).\n     7\n      While the guidelines do not explicitly foreclose going below\nlevel 33, “the Commission does not envision that departure below\nthat specified in § 2A1.2 (Second Degree Murder) is likely to be\nappropriate.” U.S.S.G. § 2A1.1, cmt. n.1.\n\n                               -10-\n\f            other situation certainly, he was a lesser\n            participant in this offense than in others.\n\n            While there is certainly some evidence that the court\n\nfelt sympathetic for Hansen’s situation in light of Pinkerton,\n\nbased upon this record, there can be little doubt but that Hansen\n\nfalls   short     of   meeting   the    burden   of   showing   a     reasonable\n\nprobability that the district court would have imposed a more\n\nlenient sentence under an advisory guideline regime.\n\n            B.     Crawford v. Washington\n\n            In Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), the\n\nSupreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause\n\nprohibits   the    admission     of    out-of-court    statements      that   are\n\ntestimonial in nature unless the declarant is unavailable and the\n\ndefendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant\n\nconcerning the statements. Id. at 68. Relying on Crawford, Hansen\n\nargues that the district court improperly admitted into evidence\n\nthe following:\n\n            (1)    Brennan’s   testimony    concerning   his\n                   conversation with Hansen, Sheehan, and\n                   John Shirko about the need to wear\n                   certain clothes when stealing vehicles to\n                   be used in robberies;\n\n            (2)    Brennan’s testimony that Robby Brady\n                   asked Hansen and Brennan if he could come\n                   along with them to steal a car;\n\n            (3)    Brennan’s testimony that Fidler              was\n                   satisfied with the stolen minivan;\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f          (4)       Brennan’s testimony that Hansen told him\n                    that Bird said to “chill out [about the\n                    money], there’s too much heat around”;\n\n          (5)       Agent Travaglia’s testimony that Stephen\n                    Brennan agreed to record a conversation\n                    with Hansen; and\n\n          (6)       Stephen Brennan’s statements made during\n                    the recorded conversation with Hansen.\n\n          Hansen’s reliance on Crawford, however, is misplaced for\n\ntwo reasons.        First, for Crawford to apply, the out-of-court\n\nstatement must be testimonial in nature. See Crawford, 541 U.S. at\n\n56.    Although      the   Supreme   Court   did      not   define   the     term\n\n“testimonial,” it gave us three examples of statements that would\n\nbe testimonial: ex-parte in-court testimony (or its equivalent);\n\nstatements contained in formalized documents (such as affidavits\n\nand depositions); and statements made as part of a confession\n\nresulting from custodial interrogation.            See id. at 51-52.           In\n\nlight of these formulations, we find that, with the exception of\n\nStephen Brennan’s recorded statements, the challenged statements\n\nare   nontestimonial       because   they    are   either      co-conspirator\n\nstatements made during the course of and in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy,    or    casual   remarks   which   the    declarant     would    not\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\freasonably expect to be available for use at a later trial.8              See\n\nHorton v. Allen, 370 F.3d 75, 84 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           The statements of Stephen Brennan are not barred by\n\nCrawford because they were not offered for their truth, but to\n\nprovide context to the recorded conversation.9             See Crawford, 541\n\nU.S. at 60 n.9, (“The [Confrontation] Clause . . . does not bar the\n\nuse of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing\n\nthe truth of the matter asserted.”); see also United States v.\n\nJimenez,   419   F.3d   34,   44   (1st    Cir.   2005)   (finding   Crawford\n\ninapplicable     because      “challenged     statements     were    properly\n\nadmissible, not for their truth, but to provide context”); cf.\n\nUnited States v. Logan, 419 F.3d 172, 178 (2d Cir. 2005) (stating\n\nthat “the mere fact that the content of [the] statements cast doubt\n\non [a defendant’s] innocence does not bring those statements within\n\nthe ambit of Sixth Amendment protection under Crawford”).\n\n           Consequently, Hansen’s arguments are without merit.\n\n           C.    Jury Instructions\n\n           Hansen next argues that the district court erred by\n\nfailing to instruct the jury about the possibility of multiple\n\n\n     8\n       Hansen, while making generalized statements of “multi-level\nhearsay,” only raises constitutional Crawford challenges. Because\nwe find the statements are nontestimonial, for purposes of these\nappeals, we need not discuss whether the statements constitute\ninadmissible hearsay.\n     9\n       When an out-of-court statement is not offered to prove the\ntruth of the matter asserted, it is not hearsay under Fed. R. Evid.\n801(c).\n\n                                    -13-\n\fconspiracies - that is, a conspiracy to steal the minivan as well\n\nas a separate conspiracy to rob the armored truck.            The Government\n\nretorts that this argument not only is without merit, but has been\n\nwaived and should not be considered on appeal.           We agree that the\n\nclaim is waived.\n\n           An   issue    is   waived   when   a   defendant     intentionally\n\nrelinquishes or abandons a legal right.               See United States v.\n\nMitchell, 85 F.3d 800, 807 (1st Cir. 1996).             Waiver is distinct\n\nfrom forfeiture, which occurs when a party fails to timely assert\n\na right, in that a forfeited issue is reviewed for plain error\n\nwhile a waived issue generally may not be reviewed.               See United\n\nStates v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           Hansen, through counsel, not only failed to object to the\n\ncourt’s omission of his proposed multiple conspiracy instruction,\n\nbut also affirmatively stated “I am content” after the district\n\ncourt instructed the jury. We hold that this statement constitutes\n\nan   explicit   withdrawal     of   the   proffered    charge    on   multiple\n\nconspiracies, and as such, the issue is waived and may not be\n\nrevived on appeal.      See id. at 437 (finding appellant bound by his\n\nexpress waiver when he deliberately withdrew his objection).\n\n           We will pause to note, however, as we pass by this claim,\n\neven though it is waived, that the evidence adduced at trial\n\noverwhelmingly demonstrated that Hansen knew the minivan would be\n\nused in the armored truck robbery, knew that guns would be used in\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fthe robbery, and expected his payment to depend on the success of\n\nthe robbery.     Accordingly, the district court did not commit plain\n\nerror as a reasonable jury could not have found more than one\n\nillicit agreement or an agreement different than the one charged.\n\nSee United States v. Balthazard, 360 F.3d 309, 315-16 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (citing United States v. Bandon, 17 F.3d 409, 449 (1st Cir.\n\n1994)).\n\n            D.     Prosecutorial Vouching\n\n            Hansen contends that the Government engaged in improper\n\n“vouching” in both its opening statement and closing argument.\n\nAgain, because no objection was raised at trial, we review only for\n\nplain error.      See United States v. Millan, 230 F.3d 431, 438 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).      These arguments need not detain us long.\n\n            “A prosecutor improperly vouches for a witness when she\n\nplaces the prestige of her office behind the government’s case by\n\n. . .     imparting her personal belief in a witness’s veracity or\n\nimplying that the jury should credit the prosecution’s evidence\n\nsimply because the government can be trusted.”      United States v.\n\nPerez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing United States v.\n\nFigueroa-Encarnacion, 343 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir. 2003)).       In the\n\nfirst challenged remark, the prosecutor told the jury during his\n\nopening statement told the jury that Brennan’s plea agreement\n\n“required him to tell the truth.”     This statement is not improper,\n\nbecause we have clearly held that “a prosecutor properly may admit\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fa witness’s plea agreement into evidence, discuss the details of\n\nthe plea during closing arguments, and comment upon a witness’s\n\nincentive to testify truthfully.”       United States v. Bey, 188 F.3d\n\n1, 7 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          Hansen’s second challenge is to the closing, where the\n\nprosecutor stated:\n\n               The other thing I want to point out, and\n          this is Brendan Brennan’s agreement with the\n          government and also what he said on the stand.\n          What did he say on the stand about what his\n          agreement was? He didn’t say, ‘My agreement\n          is to convict PJ.’ He said, ‘My agreement is\n          to tell the truth.’    He said that over and\n          over again. ‘My deal with the government is\n          to tell the truth.’ And any benefit [Brennan]\n          gets is based on whether he tells the truth.\n          It’s in the agreement, ladies and gentlemen.\n          Go ahead and read it.    His deal here is to\n          tell the truth, and I submit to you, that is\n          precisely what he did during this trial.\n\nThese remarks were made in rebuttal to Hansen’s closing, in which\n\nHansen argued that Brennan’s testimony was “bought and paid for” by\n\nthe Government.     In this context, we “typically cede prosecutors\n\nsome latitude in responding to defense counsel’s allegations of\n\nfabrication.”     Perez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d at 10.    Latitude or not, the\n\nprosecutor’s comments do not constitute improper vouching as they\n\ndo no more than recite facts that are in evidence - that Brennan\n\nagreed to testify truthfully as part of his plea agreement - and\n\nassert why Brennan should be believed.     See Millan, 230 F.3d at 438\n\nn.6 (finding no error where prosecutor stated “I submit to you she\n\nis testifying, she has a plea agreement, she has kept that plea\n\n                                 -16-\n\fagreement . . . . She has a plea agreement to testify truthfully .\n\n. . . I submit to you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you can\n\nconsider the fact, consider the fact that she has indeed testified\n\ntruthfully.”).\n\n           In a similar vein, Hansen urges that the Government\n\nimproperly     referred        to    stricken       testimony   during    its   closing\n\nargument - specifically, Brennan’s testimony that Hansen stated he\n\n(Hansen) would “do the ten years if [he] had to” for his role in\n\nthe offense. This portion of Brennan’s testimony, however, was not\n\nstricken by the district court and it was proper for the Government\n\nto refer to this evidence in its closing.\n\n           As such, Hansen is unable to show plain error regarding\n\nthe vouching claim.\n\n           E.     Motion For A New Trial\n\n           Hansen believes that the district court erred in denying\n\nhis   motion    for   a    new       trial    because    the    Government      withheld\n\nexculpatory evidence in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83\n\n(1963). This claim is reviewed for a manifest abuse of discretion.\n\nSee United States v. Glenn, 389 F.3d 283, 287 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           The    Supreme           Court’s    holding    in    Brady    requires   the\n\nGovernment to disclose exculpatory evidence which is “material\n\neither to guilt or to punishment.”                     Brady, 373 U.S. at 87.         A\n\ndistrict court may award a new trial based on newly discovered\n\nevidence   subject        to   disclosure       under    Brady    if    the   defendant\n\n\n                                             -17-\n\fdemonstrates “both that the evidence is material and that there is\n\na ‘reasonable probability’ that it would produce an acquittal upon\n\nretrial.”    United States v. Wall, 349 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(citing United States v. Josleyn, 206 F.3d 144, 151 (1st Cir.\n\n2000)).\n\n            The   alleged   Brady   violation       in   this    case   involves\n\nevidence “that Fidler associated with three separate ‘crews’ who\n\nfrequently changed plans and stole cars on the way to various\n\nrobberies.”    The import of this evidence, according to Hansen, is\n\nthat Fidler always acted spontaneously and with different groups of\n\npeople;   thus,   it   allegedly    shows   that    Hansen      could   not   have\n\n“reasonably foreseen” that Fidler would use the stolen minivan to\n\nrob an armored truck.\n\n            It is not enough for Hansen to show “the mere possibility\n\nthat an item of undisclosed information might have helped [his]\n\ndefense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial.”                United\n\nStates v. Garcia-Torres, 341 F.3d 61, 70 (1st Cir 2003) (internal\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted).            Instead, Hansen must show\n\nthe evidence to be of such probative value that there is a\n\nreasonable probability it would produce a different result.                    See\n\nid.   Hansen’s attempt to meet this burden falls far short.               First,\n\nthe relevancy of Fidler’s erratic behavior in 1998 is, at best,\n\nunclear, because it involved armored truck robberies that occurred\n\nnearly two years after the robbery at issue here.                   Second, the\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fevidence is hardly exculpatory - if anything, it seems to reinforce\n\nthe notion that Fidler was a consummate gun-toting robber who was\n\nhighly likely to use stolen vehicles to accomplish his criminal\n\ngoals.     For these reasons, we find no abuse of discretion in the\n\ndistrict court’s denial of the new trial motion.\n\n            Bundled with Hansen’s Brady challenge is a general claim\n\nof ineffective assistance of counsel. Even if it were sufficiently\n\nfact-specific (which it is not), “we have held with a regularity\n\nbordering on the monotonous that . . . claims of ineffective\n\nassistance [of counsel] cannot make their debut on direct review”\n\nbut should be presented to the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2255.    United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n            F.   Pinkerton v. United States\n\n            As we discussed in connection with the Booker challenge,\n\nthe district court gave the jury a Pinkerton instruction that\n\nallowed the jury to find that Hansen, by virtue of his membership\n\nin   the    charged   conspiracy,    was   criminally   liable   for   the\n\nsubstantive offenses committed by his co-conspirators during the\n\ncourse of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. See Pinkerton, 328\n\nU.S. at 645-48.       Hansen attacks his conviction under Pinkerton,\n\narguing (1) he was not afforded adequate notice of the essential\n\nnature of the charges against him; (2) the evidence does not\n\nsupport a finding that Fidler’s use of a firearm to commit armed\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\frobbery was reasonably foreseeable to Hansen; and (3) the district\n\ncourt’s wording of the Pinkerton instruction was improper.\n\n            As to notice, the indictment told Hansen that he was\n\nbeing   charged   in   Counts      1-3    for    aiding   and   abetting     robbery\n\naffecting commerce, conspiring to affect commerce by robbery, and\n\nusing a firearm during a crime of violence and thereby causing\n\nmurder.   The unambiguous language of the indictment, combined with\n\nour   decisions   which     have    made        abundantly   clear    that    a   co-\n\nconspirator is liable for acts committed by other members in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy, see, e.g., United States v. Sanchez,\n\n917 F.2d 607, 612 (1st Cir. 1990), convince us that Hansen,\n\nrepresented by experienced defense counsel, suffered no unfair\n\nsurprise.\n\n            Nor   is   Hansen      able    to     persuasively    challenge       the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence that was presented against him.                       The\n\nGovernment’s case relied primarily on the damaging testimony of\n\nHansen’s childhood friend, Brennan.              We previously described their\n\nfriendship as unfortunate, and undoubtedly it was - their combined\n\nactions resulted in a tragic loss of life and countless other\n\noffenses.     Their partnership was particularly unfortunate for\n\nHansen,   because,     as   the    district       court   observed,    “[w]ithout\n\nBrennan, there was no case.”               Hansen, 256 F. Supp. 2d at 69.\n\nBrennan’s testimony revealed not only that Hansen was aware of the\n\npossibility that the minivan might be used in an armed robbery, but\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\fthat Fidler told him the minivan was needed for an armored car\n\nrobbery and guns would be used during the robbery.                    Moreover,\n\nBrennan and Hansen discussed how armored car robberies often\n\nresulted in killings, and knew their payment was contingent on the\n\nsuccess of the heist.       Under de novo review and taken in the light\n\nmost favorable to the jury’s guilty verdict, see United States v.\n\nFelton, 417 F.3d 97, 104 (1st Cir. 2005), Hansen’s challenge to the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence is simply unavailing.\n\n            Because there was sufficient evidence to allow the jury\n\nto conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Hansen and others were\n\nmembers of the same underlying conspiracy, the Pinkerton charge to\n\nthe jury was proper.        See United States v. Torres, 162 F.3d 6, 10\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).       We, thus, “are not confronted with the sort of\n\n‘marginal case’ in which the Pinkerton instruction sometimes causes\n\nconcern.”        Sanchez,   917   F.2d   at   612   n.4   (citation   omitted).\n\nAdditionally, after review of the district court’s charge, we find\n\nit contains all elements of a standard Pinkerton instruction,\n\nincluding emphasis that the jury was obligated to find each element\n\nof Pinkerton beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n            G.     Double Jeopardy\n\n            Hansen contends that his indictment and conviction for\n\nviolations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c) and (j), and the underlying\n\nviolent crimes pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1951, violate the Double\n\nJeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment because these counts involve\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fthe same criminal conduct.    We review for plain error because this\n\nargument was not raised below.     See United States v. Winter, 70\n\nF.3d 655, 666 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n          If this issue had been raised prior to 1995, Hansen’s\n\ncontention may have been viewed as novel.         But by now, this\n\nargument is old hat, and borders on frivolous.   We have repeatedly\n\nheld “that Congress intended § 924(c)’s firearm violation ‘to serve\n\nas a cumulative punishment in addition to that provided for the\n\nunderlying violent crime’ and that the Double Jeopardy Clause was\n\ntherefore not offended.”     United States v. Gonzalez-Arimont, 268\n\nF.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 2001) (citing United States v. Centano-Torres,\n\n50 F.3d 84, 85 (1st Cir. 1995)); see also United States v. Battle,\n\n289 F.3d 661, 669 (10th Cir. 2002) (finding no double jeopardy\n\nviolation for convictions under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951 and 924(c) and\n\n(j)).\n\n          H.   Suppression Arguments\n\n          Next, Hansen argues that based upon the Fifth and Sixth\n\nAmendments, the district court should have suppressed inculpatory\n\nevidence, including Hansen’s grand jury testimony and the tape\n\nrecorded conversation with Stephan Brennan.      The Government is\n\nquick to point out that these arguments are waived as Hansen never\n\nmoved to suppress this evidence on Fifth and Sixth Amendment\n\ngrounds, nor did he object to its admission on that basis.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f            Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(3) requires\n\ndefendants to file suppression motions prior to trial, and failure\n\nto do so constitutes express waiver.             See Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3)\n\nand (h).   We interpret the mandatory language of Rule 12 broadly to\n\ninclude waiver when a defendant fails to file a motion to suppress\n\nbefore trial, and have even extended waiver to a situation where a\n\nsuppression motion was filed, but the defendant did not include a\n\nparticular ground and wished to add it later.             See United States v.\n\nSantos Batista, 239 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v.\n\nTorres, 162 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            This case does not fall at the outer bounds of our waiver\n\ndecisions.       Rather, it presents squarely a situation where a\n\ndefendant has failed altogether to file a motion to suppress below,\n\nand as such, we will not consider Hansen’s suppression arguments on\n\nappeal.    See Santos Batista, 239 F.3d at 19-20.\n\n            I.        Leading Questions\n\n            Hansen contends that his due process rights were violated\n\nby the Government’s use of leading questions during its direct\n\nexamination      of    Brennan.      The   Rules   of   Evidence   provide   that\n\n“[l]eading questions should not be used on the direct examination\n\nof a witness except as may be necessary to develop the witness’\n\ntestimony.”      Fed. R. Evid. 611(c).         “The evil of leading a friendly\n\nwitness is that the information conveyed in the questions may\n\nsupply a false memory.”           United States v. McGovern, 499 F.2d 1140,\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\f1142 (1st Cir. 1974) (internal quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted).    There is, of course, a degree of tolerance for leading\n\nquestions under certain circumstances.                Because it is so case-\n\nspecific, “the trial judge is best situated to strike a practical\n\nand fair balance” and is afforded “extensive discretion over the\n\nphrasing of questions.”         Id.\n\n            As   proof   that    the    entire      trial    was     unfair,   Hansen\n\nreferences two transcript pages, suggesting they contain “examples”\n\nof the Government’s abuse.            After reviewing this portion of the\n\ntranscript, we note that trial counsel did not object to questions\n\nas leading and, therefore, review is for plain error.                      Clearly,\n\nthere is no plain error; the questions simply do not cross the\n\n“fine line between stimulating an accurate memory and implanting a\n\nfalse one.”      Id.\n\n            The Government’s questions were used primarily to develop\n\ncoherent testimony from Brennan.               This was especially important\n\nhere because, based upon Hansen and Brennan’s long criminal history\n\ntogether, there was a risk of eliciting highly prejudicial (and\n\nultimately irrelevant) information from Brennan.10                     Moreover, we\n\nnote that defense counsel engaged in a thorough cross-examination\n\nof   Brennan,    which   enabled       the   jury    to     assess    appropriately\n\n\n\n      10\n       This could also explain why defense counsel chose not to\nobject to some of the leading questions. See Matthews v. Rakiey,\n54 F.3d 908, 929 (1st Cir. 1995) (failing to object to leading\nquestions “is generally considered a tactical decision”).\n\n                                        -24-\n\fBrennan’s testimony.   See United States v. Noone, 913 F.2d 20, 37\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (considering defense counsel’s thorough cross-\n\nexamination in deciding that no prejudicial error occurred from use\n\nof a leading question).   Thus, reversal is not warranted.\n\n          Hansen’s   argument   also    alludes   to   leading   questions\n\noutside of his general examples. We decline the invitation to mind\n\nread, however, and instead find that such claim of error is\n\ninadequately developed on appeal.      See United States v. Bongiorno,\n\n106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997) (stating that issues are waived\n\nwhen “raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not accompanied by\n\ndeveloped argumentation”).    Even so, in the majority of instances,\n\nno objection was made below and were we to review, it would again\n\nbe for plain error - an insurmountable hurdle considering Hansen\n\nhas made little, if any, effort to show that such error likely\n\naffected the outcome below.\n\n          J.   Juror Note\n\n          Hansen claims that he was denied a fair trial because\n\nduring trial the jury expressed general concerns about privacy.\n\nOnce again, the piers of Hansen’s argument are undermined by\n\nwaiver.\n\n          On May 23, 2002, the court received the following note\n\nfrom juror number two:\n\n          The jury in general was concerned about safety\n          in regard to our names having been used on\n          Monday in front of the defendant and also,\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\f          just in general we’d just like affirmation\n          that no witnesses, etc. will know our names.\n\nInitially, defense counsel broached the idea of excusing this juror\n\nbecause counsel was concerned that the expression of fear showed\n\nthat she had prejudged Hansen.      Defense counsel elaborated:   “If\n\nit’s just a general feeling that the jurors have, fine, that may\n\nwell be cured by an instruction.”    The court agreed and proposed a\n\ncurative instruction to the attorneys, to which defense counsel\n\nresponded, “Something along those lines, Judge, fine.”\n\n          The court, along with counsel, met with juror number two,\n\nand learned that, in fact, the general concerns expressed in the\n\nnote were those of the jury as a whole, and had blossomed prior to\n\nthe start of evidence (and, therefore, had no specific reference to\n\nHansen or his activities).   This conversation apparently appeased\n\nHansen’s attorney, who withdrew his objection to juror number two\n\nby stating, “Given the young lady’s remarks, your Honor, I think an\n\ninstruction from you will be curative at this point.”      The court\n\nthen gave an instruction to the jury which was substantially\n\nsimilar to the proposed instruction previously agreed to.         The\n\ndefense interposed no objection to this instruction.\n\n          Based on this record, it is clear that trial counsel\n\ndiligently raised potential juror issues with the district court.\n\nWe decline, however, to revisit them on appeal because counsel\n\naffirmatively withdrew any objections to juror number two, and\n\nspecifically agreed to the court’s curative instruction.          See,\n\n                                 -26-\n\fe.g., Rodriguez, 311 F.3d at 437. Nonetheless, we believe that the\n\ndistrict court, utilizing its considerable discretion in fashioning\n\ncurative instructions, took appropriate measures to maintain the\n\nintegrity of Hansen’s right to a fair trial.\n\n            K.   Inconsistent Theories\n\n            As his final claim of error, Hansen argues that the\n\nGovernment presented factually inconsistent theories during its\n\nprosecutions of Hansen and Brennan.          Based upon the record before\n\nus, we disagree.    Hansen seems to take issue with the fact that\n\nduring Brennan’s case, the Government concentrated on Brennan’s\n\nrole in the offenses, and vice versa in Hansen’s case.               There is\n\nnothing   inconsistent   about   this      approach.    In   fact,    in    both\n\ninstances the Government theorized the existence of a conspiracy to\n\nsteal a minivan for use in an armed robbery.                 The Government\n\neventually   learned   that   the   minivan     theft   resulted     from    the\n\nconcerted efforts of Hansen and Brennan on the night of July 27,\n\n1996.     Of course, the full extent of Hansen’s involvement was\n\nunearthed after Brennan’s conviction, so it is not surprising that\n\nthe Government’s theory at Hansen’s trial had a slightly different\n\ngloss.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\f            Accordingly, we find Hansen’s last challenge to be wholly\n\nwithout merit.11\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     11\n       We need not discuss, therefore, the applicability of United\nStates v. Weems, 322 F.3d 18, 24 (1st Cir. 2003) (finding “no risk\nto defendants’ rights when two different juries are involved”).\n\n                                 -28-\n\f",

He now appeals both his conviction and sentence, bringing no less than eleven claims of error. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with an overview of the facts of this case, in the light most favorable to the Government as the prevailing party. The unfortunate friendship of Hansen and Brendan Brennan (\"Brennan\") spawned from their childhood association with the Boys' Club in Charlestown, Massachusetts, when the two were about twelve years old. During their teen years, they became friendly with an older man from the neighborhood, Scott Sheehan (\"Sheehan\"), who made money by robbing banks. Sheehan instructed his two young apprentices about various aspects of the criminal trade, including the finer points of stealing cars. Under Sheehan's tutelage, the young men learned, for example, that to prevent police detection when stealing vehicles that were to be used in robberies, they should wear certain clothes such as nylon pants, long-sleeved shirts, hats, and gloves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pair wasted no time putting their newly acquired skills to use &#8212; between June, 1994 and the summer of 1996, Brennan was involved in stealing approximately 100 cars, with Hansen participating in roughly 65-70 of these thefts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Brennan's budding criminal career hit bumps in the road, however, when he was arrested and convicted of four different auto thefts in 1995 and 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Brennan was incarcerated for one of these auto thefts, Hansen continued to mingle with the wrong crowd, and eventually learned of an upcoming criminal opportunity from a Charlestown acquaintance named John Fidler (\"Fidler\"). On July 25, 1996, Hansen met up with Brennan, who had just been released from jail, and told him that Fidler and two other individuals from Charlestown, Dennis Bird (\"Bird\") and Billy McKillop (\"McKillop\"), were planning to rob an armored truck and wanted Hansen to help out by stealing a minivan. (A minivan was the vehicle of choice for such a venture because the sliding doors and removable seats conceal the robbers and allow for easy exit during the heat of a robbery.) According to Brennan, Fidler and his crew were apparently in the process of replacing another Charlestown group that robbed armored trucks while that group was incarcerated for a robbery in Hudson, New Hampshire, which had resulted in the death of two guards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, Hansen, Fidler, Bird, and McKillop unsuccessfully tried to pilfer a minivan. Having had difficulty stealing these types of vehicles in the past, Hansen asked the more adroit Brennan to lend a hand, with the understanding that both Hansen and Brennan would be compensated for the theft. Brennan understood that the minivan to be stolen was to be used in an armored truck robbery, firearms would be used during the robbery, and he and Hansen would earn more money if the robbery was successful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of July 27, 1996, Hansen and Brennan donned nylon pants, long-sleeved shirts, and gloves and trolled the streets of Charlestown for a suitable vehicle. Before long, the pair noticed an attractive white minivan with tinted windows. While Hansen kept watch, Brennan broke into the vehicle and started the engine. After stashing the stolen minivan in Somerville, Massachusetts, Hansen and Brennan showed Fidler and Bird their quarry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four days later, on July 31, 1996, a Dunbar armored truck driven by Michael Day (\"Day\") and Edward Kubera (\"Kubera\") parked at the Twin City Plaza in Somerville to deliver currency to a Star Market. Kubera unloaded boxes of coins while Day remained in the truck and watched for suspicious activity. While they were working, a white minivan approached the armored truck with tires squealing. An individual dressed in a ski mask and gloves exited the minivan, pointed a handgun at Day's head, and instructed him to lie on the floor of the truck. At the same time, another masked man wearing gloves and dark clothes approached the armored truck with an assault rifle and brutally shot Kubera in the chest. The second robber climbed over Day to enter the armored truck, collected approximately $3,725, and took Day's firearm. The armed robbers escaped as quickly as they had arrived, with the entire robbery lasting only a few minutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> An hour later, Kubera died.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The resulting investigation produced statements by Brennan explaining Hansen's role in the robbery,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> as well as a conversation recorded by Brennan's father, Stephen Brennan, in which Hansen admitted that Fidler had asked him to steal a vehicle. Hansen was indicted on June 14, 2001 (nearly five years after the heist), on charges that he (1) aided and abetted robbery affecting commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2 and 1951(a); (2) conspired to affect commerce by means of robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a); (3) used a firearm during a crime of violence and thereby caused murder, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 924(c), and 924(j); and (4) made a false material declaration before a grand jury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1623. At trial, the Government's case-in-chief was primarily based upon Brennan's testimony, which largely consisted of the factual account set forth above. The jury found Hansen guilty on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen was sentenced on October 9, 2002. At the sentencing hearing and in a subsequently filed Memorandum dated February 14, 2003, the district court explained its findings. The court grouped Counts 1, 2, and 4 together and determined a base offense level of 43 using the first degree murder guideline. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A1.1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The court then departed downward to an offense level of 33 based upon Hansen's state of mind. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A1.1 cmt. n. 1 (\"The extent of the departure should be based upon the defendant's state of mind (<i>e.g.,</i> recklessness or negligence), the degree of risk inherent in the conduct, and the nature of the underlying offense conduct.\"). A two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice was added because Hansen testified falsely before the grand jury, resulting in a total offense level of 35. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2(c). Because Hansen had a criminal history category of VI, the district court calculated Hansen's guideline sentencing range to be 292 to 365 months. The court sentenced Hansen to a 352-month term of imprisonment (292 months on counts 1, 2, and 4 &#8212; the grouped counts &#8212; and a consecutive term of 60 months on count 3). Five years of supervised release and a restitution payment of $3,775 were also imposed. These appeals followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen appeals both his conviction and sentence, raising no less than eleven points of error. We address each challenge in turn, taking the sentencing issue first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Booker Sentencing Issue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen's first and main line of attack is the fact that the district court sentenced him under the prior mandatory guideline regime. <i>See United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Despite his claim to the contrary, however, Hansen did not argue to the district court that the guidelines were unconstitutional or that his sentence violated <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); therefore, his <i>Booker</i> claim is not preserved and thus we review for plain error. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 77 (1st Cir.2005). Under plain error review, Hansen must show \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen is able to meet the first two elements because he was sentenced under a mandatory guideline regime. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 77. The question is whether he is able to show a reasonable probability \"that the sentencing court, freed of the shackles forged by mandatory guidelines, would have fashioned a more favorable sentence.\" <i>United States v. Guzman,</i> 419 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir.2005). While we have said that we are not \"overly demanding as to proof of probability,\" <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.2005), the defendant \"must point to specific indicia\" that reasonable probability exists. <i>United States v. Sanchez-Berrios,</i> 424 F.3d 65, 80 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support his claim that it is reasonably probable that sentencing under a non-mandatory system would have yielded a different result, Hansen points to the following statement in the district judge's February 14, 2003 sentencing memorandum:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant was 19. The people who enlisted him in stealing the van were at least ten years older, with a brutal reputation in Charlestown. While the law holds Hansen responsible for the foreseeable consequence of his acts, it is clear that his relationship to the armored car robbery that resulted in the tragic murder of Edward Kubera was tenuous. He had, at most, only the most general idea of the plans of Fidler and Bird. He did not know <i>when</i> the robbery would take place, <i>where,</i> or of <i>whom.</i> While Brennan suggests that Hansen knew that guns would be involved &#8212; semi-automatic guns at that &#8212; Hansen had no control over how they would be brandished, or indeed, whether they would be used at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Hansen,</i> 256 F.Supp.2d 65, 72 (D.Mass.2003). These comments do suggest that the district judge was sympathetic to Hansen's situation in light of the jury's guilty verdict on Count 3, which held Hansen accountable for the shooting as a \"foreseeable consequence of the use of a firearm in the course of the conspiracy.\" <i>See Pinkerton v. United States,</i> 328 U.S. 640, 648, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946). Scrutinized in the context of the entire memorandum, however, the court's statements do little more than explain why it chose to depart downward to the second degree murder guideline (U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A1.2 (base offense level of 33)) instead of using the first degree murder guideline (U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A1.1 (base offense level of 43)). Nothing in the judge's comments imply that she would have imposed a different sentence had she been operating under an advisory guideline regime. In fact, a review of the entire record indicates just the opposite. The district court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this area, the guidelines permit me to make a more nuanced judgment as to what kind of sentence Hansen deserves than the jury did. The jury may have found the killing \"foreseeable\" but I cannot conclude that it was \"intentional.\" If there ever were a case in which the downward departure to a second degree murder guideline was appropriate, it is this one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Hansen,</i> 256 F.Supp.2d at 72. Other comments by the court at the October 9, 2002 sentencing hearing indicate that to the extent the judge felt constrained, it was as a result of the jury's guilty verdict on the conspiracy counts, not the mandatory guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Indeed, the judge's comments indicate that she felt the mandatory guidelines allowed her room to craft an appropriate sentence based upon Hansen's actual role and his state of mind. This is critical because here, in contrast to the vast majority of cases, the applicable guidelines encourage the sentencing judge to choose the most appropriate point along a spectrum, from first degree murder (level 43) to second degree murder (level 33)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> based upon an evaluation of state of mind. The judge exercised this authority by placing the crime at the level she found appropriate (level 33).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But having exercised the authority to depart, the court also made it clear that it would go no lower: \"[t]here's no way I'm going to go below a Level 33.\" It is also clear that the court believed Hansen played a greater role than Brennan in the offenses, and deserved a longer sentence than Brennan's 320 months. As the judge explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the relationship, though, between Mr. Brennan and Mr. Hansen, I agree with the government that I will not give a role adjustment to Mr. Hansen, one that Mr. Brennan got. I do think that, whatever Mr. Brennan might have been involved in in any other situation certainly, he was a lesser participant in this offense than in others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While there is certainly some evidence that the court felt sympathetic for Hansen's situation in light of <i>Pinkerton,</i> based upon this record, there can be little doubt but that Hansen falls short of meeting the burden of showing a reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a more lenient sentence under an advisory guideline regime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Crawford v. Washington</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause prohibits the admission of out-of-court statements that are testimonial in nature unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant concerning the statements. <i>Id.</i> at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Relying on <i>Crawford,</i> Hansen argues that the district court improperly admitted into evidence the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Brennan's testimony concerning his conversation with Hansen, Sheehan, and John Shirko about the need to wear certain clothes when stealing vehicles to be used in robberies;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Brennan's testimony that Robby Brady asked Hansen and Brennan if he could come along with them to steal a car;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Brennan's testimony that Fidler was satisfied with the stolen minivan;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) Brennan's testimony that Hansen told him that Bird said to \"chill out [about the money], there's too much heat around\";</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) Agent Travaglia's testimony that Stephen Brennan agreed to record a conversation with Hansen; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(6) Stephen Brennan's statements made during the recorded conversation with Hansen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen's reliance on <i>Crawford,</i> however, is misplaced for two reasons. First, for <i>Crawford</i> to apply, the out-of-court statement must be testimonial in nature. <i>See Crawford,</i> 541 U.S. at 56, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Although the Supreme Court did not define the term \"testimonial,\" it gave us three examples of statements that would be testimonial: ex-parte in-court testimony (or its equivalent); statements contained in formalized documents (such as affidavits and depositions); and statements made as part of a confession resulting from custodial interrogation. <i>See id.</i> at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. 1354. In light of these formulations, we find that, with the exception of Stephen Brennan's recorded statements, the challenged statements are nontestimonial because they are either co-conspirator statements made during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy, or casual remarks which the declarant would not reasonably expect to be available for use at a later trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See Horton v. Allen,</i> 370 F.3d 75, 84 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statements of Stephen Brennan are not barred by <i>Crawford</i> because they were not offered for their truth, but to provide context to the recorded conversation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See Crawford,</i> 541 U.S. at 60 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. 1354, (\"The [Confrontation] Clause . . . does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\"); <i>see also United States v. Jimenez,</i> 419 F.3d 34, 44 (1st Cir.2005) (finding <i>Crawford</i> inapplicable because \"challenged statements were properly admissible, not for their truth, but to provide context\"); <i>cf. United States v. Logan,</i> 419 F.3d 172, 178 (2d Cir.2005) (stating that \"the mere fact that the content of [the] statements cast doubt on [a defendant's] innocence does not bring those statements within the ambit of Sixth Amendment protection under <i>Crawford</i>\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, Hansen's arguments are without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen next argues that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury about the possibility of multiple conspiracies &#8212; that is, a conspiracy to steal the minivan as well as a separate conspiracy to rob the armored truck. The Government retorts that this argument not only is without merit, but has been waived and should not be considered on appeal. We agree that the claim is waived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An issue is waived when a defendant intentionally relinquishes or abandons a legal right. <i>See United States v. Mitchell,</i> 85 F.3d 800, 807 (1st Cir.1996). Waiver is distinct from forfeiture, which occurs when a party fails to timely assert a right, in that a forfeited issue is reviewed for plain error while a waived issue generally may not be reviewed. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen, through counsel, not only failed to object to the court's omission of his proposed multiple conspiracy instruction, but also affirmatively stated \"I am content\" after the district court instructed the jury. We hold that this statement constitutes an explicit withdrawal of the proffered charge on multiple conspiracies, and as such, the issue is waived and may not be revived on appeal. <i>See id.</i> at 437 (finding appellant bound by his express waiver when he deliberately withdrew his objection).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will pause to note, however, as we pass by this claim, even though it is waived, that the evidence adduced at trial overwhelmingly demonstrated that Hansen knew the minivan would be used in the armored truck robbery, knew that guns would be used in the robbery, and expected his payment to depend on the success of the robbery. Accordingly, the district court did not commit plain error as a reasonable jury could not have found more than one illicit agreement or an agreement different than the one charged. <i>See United States v. Balthazard,</i> 360 F.3d 309, 315-16 (1st Cir.2004) (citing <i>United States v. Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d 409, 449 (1st Cir.1994)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Prosecutorial Vouching</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen contends that the Government engaged in improper \"vouching\" in both its opening statement and closing argument. Again, because no objection was raised at trial, we review only for plain error. <i>See United States v. Millan,</i> 230 F.3d 431, 438 (1st Cir.2000). These arguments need not detain us long.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A prosecutor improperly vouches for a witness when she places the prestige of her office behind the government's case by. . . imparting her personal belief in a witness's veracity or implying that the jury should credit the prosecution's evidence simply because the government can be trusted.\" <i>United States v. Perez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2003) (citing <i>United States v. Figueroa-Encarnacion,</i> 343 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir.2003)). In the first challenged remark, the prosecutor told the jury during his opening statement that Brennan's plea agreement \"required him to tell the truth.\" This statement is not improper, because we have clearly held that \"a prosecutor properly may admit a witness's plea agreement into evidence, discuss the details of the plea during closing arguments, and comment upon a witness's incentive to testify truthfully.\" <i>United States v. Bey,</i> 188 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen's second challenge is to the closing, where the prosecutor stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other thing I want to point out, and this is Brendan Brennan's agreement with the government and also what he said on the stand. What did he say on the stand about what his agreement was? He didn't say, `My agreement is to convict PJ.' He said, `My agreement is to tell the truth.' He said that over and over again. `My deal with the government is to tell the truth.' And any benefit [Brennan] gets is based on whether he tells the truth. It's in the agreement, ladies and gentlemen. Go ahead and read it. His deal here is to tell the truth, and I submit to you, that is precisely what he did during this trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These remarks were made in rebuttal to Hansen's closing, in which Hansen argued that Brennan's testimony was \"bought and paid for\" by the Government. In this context, we \"typically cede prosecutors some latitude in responding to defense counsel's allegations of fabrication.\" <i>Perez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d at 10. Latitude or not, the prosecutor's comments do not constitute improper vouching as they do no more than recite facts that are in evidence &#8212; that Brennan agreed to testify truthfully as part of his plea agreement &#8212; and assert why Brennan should be believed. <i>See Millan,</i> 230 F.3d at 438 n. 6 (finding no error where prosecutor stated \"I submit to you she is testifying, she has a plea agreement, she has kept that plea agreement. . . . She has a plea agreement to testify truthfully . . . . I submit to you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you can consider the fact, consider the fact that she has indeed testified truthfully.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a similar vein, Hansen urges that the Government improperly referred to stricken testimony during its closing argument-specifically, Brennan's testimony that Hansen stated he (Hansen) would \"do the ten years if [he] had to\" for his role in the offense. This portion of Brennan's testimony, however, was not stricken by the district court and it was proper for the Government to refer to this evidence in its closing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As such, Hansen is unable to show plain error regarding the vouching claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Motion For A New Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen believes that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial because the Government withheld exculpatory evidence in violation of <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). This claim is reviewed for a manifest abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Glenn,</i> 389 F.3d 283, 287 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court's holding in <i>Brady</i> requires the Government to disclose exculpatory evidence which is \"material either to guilt or to punishment.\" <i>Brady,</i> 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. A district court may award a new trial based on newly discovered evidence subject to disclosure under <i>Brady</i> if the defendant demonstrates \"both that the evidence is material and that there is a `reasonable probability' that it would produce an acquittal upon retrial.\" <i>United States v. Wall,</i> 349 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir.2003) (citing <i>United States v. Josleyn,</i> 206 F.3d 144, 151 (1st Cir.2000)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The alleged <i>Brady</i> violation in this case involves evidence \"that Fidler associated with three separate `crews' who frequently changed plans and stole cars on the way to various robberies.\" The import of this evidence, according to Hansen, is that Fidler always acted spontaneously and with different groups of people; thus, it allegedly shows that Hansen could not have \"reasonably foreseen\" that Fidler would use the stolen minivan to rob an armored truck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not enough for Hansen to show \"the mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped [his] defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial.\" <i>United States v. Garcia-Torres,</i> 341 F.3d 61, 70 (1st Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Instead, Hansen must show the evidence to be of such probative value that there is a reasonable probability it would produce a different result. <i>See</i> <i>id.</i> Hansen's attempt to meet this burden falls far short. First, the relevancy of Fidler's erratic behavior in 1998 is, at best, unclear, because it involved armored truck robberies that occurred nearly two years after the robbery at issue here. Second, the evidence is hardly exculpatory &#8212; if anything, it seems to reinforce the notion that Fidler was a consummate gun-toting robber who was highly likely to use stolen vehicles to accomplish his criminal goals. For these reasons, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's denial of the new trial motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bundled with Hansen's <i>Brady</i> challenge is a general claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Even if it were sufficiently fact-specific (which it is not), \"we have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that . . . claims of ineffective assistance [of counsel] cannot make their debut on direct review\" but should be presented to the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255. <i>United States v. Mala,</i> 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. <i>Pinkerton v. United States</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we discussed in connection with the <i>Booker</i> challenge, the district court gave the jury a <i>Pinkerton</i> instruction that allowed the jury to find that Hansen, by virtue of his membership in the charged conspiracy, was criminally liable for the substantive offenses committed by his co-conspirators during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. <i>See Pinkerton,</i> 328 U.S. at 645-48, 66 S.Ct. 1180. Hansen attacks his conviction under <i>Pinkerton,</i> arguing (1) he was not afforded adequate notice of the essential nature of the charges against him; (2) the evidence does not support a finding that Fidler's use of a firearm to commit armed robbery was reasonably foreseeable to Hansen; and (3) the district court's wording of the <i>Pinkerton</i> instruction was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to notice, the indictment told Hansen that he was being charged in Counts 1-3 for aiding and abetting robbery affecting commerce, conspiring to affect commerce by robbery, and using a firearm during a crime of violence and thereby causing murder. The unambiguous language of the indictment, combined with our decisions which have made abundantly clear that a co-conspirator is liable for acts committed by other members in furtherance of the conspiracy, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Sanchez,</i> 917 F.2d 607, 612 (1st Cir.1990), convince us that Hansen, represented by experienced defense counsel, suffered no unfair surprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is Hansen able to persuasively challenge the sufficiency of the evidence that was presented against him. The Government's case relied primarily on the damaging testimony of Hansen's childhood friend, Brennan. We previously described their friendship as unfortunate, and undoubtedly it was &#8212; their combined actions resulted in a tragic loss of life and countless other offenses. Their partnership was particularly unfortunate for Hansen, because, as the district court observed, \"[w]ithout Brennan, there was no case.\" <i>Hansen,</i> 256 F.Supp.2d at 69. Brennan's testimony revealed not only that Hansen was aware of the possibility that the minivan might be used in an armed robbery, but that Fidler told him the minivan was needed for an armored car robbery and guns would be used during the robbery. Moreover, Brennan and Hansen discussed how armored car robberies often resulted in killings, and knew their payment was contingent on the success of the heist. Under de novo review and taken in the light most favorable to the jury's guilty verdict, <i>see United States v. Felton,</i> 417 F.3d 97, 104 (1st Cir.2005), Hansen's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is simply unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because there was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Hansen and others were members of the same underlying conspiracy, the <i>Pinkerton</i> charge to the jury was proper. <i>See United States v. Torres,</i> 162 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.1998). We, thus, \"are not confronted with the sort of `marginal case' in which the <i>Pinkerton</i> instruction sometimes causes concern.\" <i>Sanchez,</i> 917 F.2d at 612 n. 4 (citation omitted). Additionally, after review of the district court's charge, we find it contains all elements of a standard <i>Pinkerton</i> instruction, including emphasis that the jury was obligated to find each element of <i>Pinkerton</i> beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">G. Double Jeopardy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen contends that his indictment and conviction for violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 924(c) and (j), and the underlying violent crimes pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951, violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment because these counts involve the same criminal conduct. We review for plain error because this argument was not raised below. <i>See United States v. Winter,</i> 70 F.3d 655, 666 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this issue had been raised prior to 1995, Hansen's contention may have been viewed as novel. But by now, this argument is old hat, and borders on frivolous. We have repeatedly held \"that Congress intended &#167; 924(c)'s firearm violation `to serve as a cumulative punishment in addition to that provided for the underlying violent crime' and that the Double Jeopardy Clause was therefore not offended.\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Arimont,</i> 268 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir.2001) (citing <i>United States v. Centeno-Torres,</i> 50 F.3d 84, 85 (1st Cir.1995)); <i>see also United States v. Battle,</i> 289 F.3d 661, 669 (10th Cir.2002) (finding no double jeopardy violation for convictions under 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1951 and 924(c) and (j)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">H. Suppression Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Hansen argues that based upon the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, the district court should have suppressed inculpatory evidence, including Hansen's grand jury testimony and the tape recorded conversation with Stephan Brennan. The Government is quick to point out that these arguments are waived as Hansen never moved to suppress this evidence on Fifth and Sixth Amendment grounds, nor did he object to its admission on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(3) requires defendants to file suppression motions prior to trial, and failure to do so constitutes express waiver. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3) and (h). We interpret the mandatory language of Rule 12 broadly to include waiver when a defendant fails to file a motion to suppress before trial, and have even extended waiver to a situation where a suppression motion was filed, but the defendant did not include a particular ground and wished to add it later. <i>See United States v. Santos Batista,</i> 239 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Torres,</i> 162 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case does not fall at the outer bounds of our waiver decisions. Rather, it presents squarely a situation where a defendant has failed altogether to file a motion to suppress below, and as such, we will not consider Hansen's suppression arguments on appeal. <i>See Santos Batista,</i> 239 F.3d at 19-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Leading Questions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen contends that his due process rights were violated by the Government's use of leading questions during its direct examination of Brennan. The Rules of Evidence provide that \"[l]eading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop the witness' testimony.\" Fed.R.Evid. 611(c). \"The evil of leading a friendly witness is that the information conveyed in the questions may supply a false memory.\" <i>United States v. McGovern,</i> 499 F.2d 1140, 1142 (1st Cir.1974) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). There is, of course, a degree of tolerance for leading questions under certain circumstances. Because it is so case-specific, \"the trial judge is best situated to strike a practical and fair balance\" and is afforded \"extensive discretion over the phrasing of questions.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As proof that the entire trial was unfair, Hansen references two transcript pages, suggesting they contain \"examples\" of the Government's abuse. After reviewing this portion of the transcript, we note that trial counsel did not object to questions as leading and, therefore, review is for plain error. Clearly, there is no plain error; the questions simply do not cross the \"fine line between stimulating an accurate memory and implanting a false one.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government's questions were used primarily to develop coherent testimony from Brennan. This was especially important here because, based upon Hansen and Brennan's long criminal history together, there was a risk of eliciting highly prejudicial (and ultimately irrelevant) information from Brennan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Moreover, we note that defense counsel engaged in a thorough cross-examination of Brennan, which enabled the jury to assess appropriately Brennan's testimony. <i>See United States v. Noone,</i> 913 F.2d 20, 37 (1st Cir.1990) (considering defense counsel's thorough cross-examination in deciding that no prejudicial error occurred from use of a leading question). Thus, reversal is not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen's argument also alludes to leading questions outside of his general examples. We decline the invitation to mind read, however, and instead find that such claim of error is inadequately developed on appeal. <i>See United States v. Bongiorno,</i> 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir.1997) (stating that issues are waived when \"raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not accompanied by developed argumentation\"). Even so, in the majority of instances, no objection was made below and were we to review, it would again be for plain error &#8212; an insurmountable hurdle considering Hansen has made little, if any, effort to show that such error likely affected the outcome below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">J. Juror Note</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen claims that he was denied a fair trial because during trial the jury expressed general concerns about privacy. Once again, the piers of Hansen's argument are undermined by waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 23, 2002, the court received the following note from juror number two:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury in general was concerned about safety in regard to our names having been used on Monday in front of the defendant and also, just in general we'd just like affirmation that no witnesses, etc. will know our names.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, defense counsel broached the idea of excusing this juror because counsel was concerned that the expression of fear showed that she had prejudged Hansen. Defense counsel elaborated: \"If it's just a general feeling that the jurors have, fine, that may well be cured by an instruction.\" The court agreed and proposed a curative instruction to the attorneys, to which defense counsel responded, \"Something along those lines, Judge, fine.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court, along with counsel, met with juror number two, and learned that, in fact, the general concerns expressed in the note were those of the jury as a whole, and had blossomed prior to the start of evidence (and, therefore, had no specific reference to Hansen or his activities). This conversation apparently appeased Hansen's attorney, who withdrew his objection to juror number two by stating, \"Given the young lady's remarks, your Honor, I think an instruction from you will be curative at this point.\" The court then gave an instruction to the jury which was substantially similar to the proposed instruction previously agreed to. The defense interposed no objection to this instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this record, it is clear that trial counsel diligently raised potential juror issues with the district court. We decline, however, to revisit them on appeal because counsel affirmatively withdrew any objections to juror number two, and specifically agreed to the court's curative instruction. <i>See, e.g., Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d at 437. Nonetheless, we believe that the district court, utilizing its considerable discretion in fashioning curative instructions, took appropriate measures to maintain the integrity of Hansen's right to a fair trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">K. Inconsistent Theories</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As his final claim of error, Hansen argues that the Government presented factually inconsistent theories during its prosecutions of Hansen and Brennan. Based upon the record before us, we disagree. Hansen seems to take issue with the fact that during Brennan's case, the Government concentrated on Brennan's role in the offenses, and vice versa in Hansen's case. There is nothing inconsistent about this approach. In fact, in both instances the Government theorized the existence of a conspiracy to steal a minivan for use in an armed robbery. The Government eventually learned that the minivan theft resulted from the concerted efforts of Hansen and Brennan on the night of July 27, 1996. Of course, the full extent of Hansen's involvement was unearthed after Brennan's conviction, so it is not surprising that the Government's theory at Hansen's trial had a slightly different gloss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we find Hansen's last challenge to be wholly without merit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The stolen vehicles were primarily used for joy-riding, stripping and selling parts, or to help individuals commit insurance fraud</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Police found a white minivan near the Twin City Plaza with damage to the door locks and steering column.

He now appeals both his conviction and sentence, bringing no less than eleven claims of error. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with an overview of the facts of this case, in the light most favorable to the Government as the prevailing party. The unfortunate friendship of Hansen and Brendan Brennan (\"Brennan\") spawned from their childhood association with the Boys' Club in Charlestown, Massachusetts, when the two were about twelve years old. During their teen years, they became friendly with an older man from the neighborhood, Scott Sheehan (\"Sheehan\"), who made money by robbing banks. Sheehan instructed his two young apprentices about various aspects of the criminal trade, including the finer points of stealing cars. Under Sheehan's tutelage, the young men learned, for example, that to prevent police detection when stealing vehicles that were to be used in robberies, they should wear certain clothes such as nylon pants, long-sleeved shirts, hats, and gloves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pair wasted no time putting their newly acquired skills to use &#8212; between June, 1994 and the summer of 1996, Brennan was involved in stealing approximately 100 cars, with Hansen participating in roughly 65-70 of these thefts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Brennan's budding criminal career hit bumps in the road, however, when he was arrested and convicted of four different auto thefts in 1995 and 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Brennan was incarcerated for one of these auto thefts, Hansen continued to mingle with the wrong crowd, and eventually learned of an upcoming criminal opportunity from a Charlestown acquaintance named John Fidler (\"Fidler\"). On July 25, 1996, Hansen met up with Brennan, who had just been released from jail, and told him that Fidler and two other individuals from Charlestown, Dennis Bird (\"Bird\") and Billy McKillop (\"McKillop\"), were planning to rob an armored truck and wanted Hansen to help out by stealing a minivan. (A minivan was the vehicle of choice for such a venture because the sliding doors and removable seats conceal the robbers and allow for easy exit during the heat of a robbery.) According to Brennan, Fidler and his crew were apparently in the process of replacing another Charlestown group that robbed armored trucks while that group was incarcerated for a robbery in Hudson, New Hampshire, which had resulted in the death of two guards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, Hansen, Fidler, Bird, and McKillop unsuccessfully tried to pilfer a minivan. Having had difficulty stealing these types of vehicles in the past, Hansen asked the more adroit Brennan to lend a hand, with the understanding that both Hansen and Brennan would be compensated for the theft. Brennan understood that the minivan to be stolen was to be used in an armored truck robbery, firearms would be used during the robbery, and he and Hansen would earn more money if the robbery was successful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of July 27, 1996, Hansen and Brennan donned nylon pants, long-sleeved shirts, and gloves and trolled the streets of Charlestown for a suitable vehicle. Before long, the pair noticed an attractive white minivan with tinted windows. While Hansen kept watch, Brennan broke into the vehicle and started the engine. After stashing the stolen minivan in Somerville, Massachusetts, Hansen and Brennan showed Fidler and Bird their quarry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four days later, on July 31, 1996, a Dunbar armored truck driven by Michael Day (\"Day\") and Edward Kubera (\"Kubera\") parked at the Twin City Plaza in Somerville to deliver currency to a Star Market. Kubera unloaded boxes of coins while Day remained in the truck and watched for suspicious activity. While they were working, a white minivan approached the armored truck with tires squealing. An individual dressed in a ski mask and gloves exited the minivan, pointed a handgun at Day's head, and instructed him to lie on the floor of the truck. At the same time, another masked man wearing gloves and dark clothes approached the armored truck with an assault rifle and brutally shot Kubera in the chest. The second robber climbed over Day to enter the armored truck, collected approximately $3,725, and took Day's firearm. The armed robbers escaped as quickly as they had arrived, with the entire robbery lasting only a few minutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> An hour later, Kubera died.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The resulting investigation produced statements by Brennan explaining Hansen's role in the robbery,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> as well as a conversation recorded by Brennan's father, Stephen Brennan, in which Hansen admitted that Fidler had asked him to steal a vehicle. Hansen was indicted on June 14, 2001 (nearly five years after the heist), on charges that he (1) aided and abetted robbery affecting commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2 and 1951(a); (2) conspired to affect commerce by means of robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a); (3) used a firearm during a crime of violence and thereby caused murder, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 924(c), and 924(j); and (4) made a false material declaration before a grand jury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1623. At trial, the Government's case-in-chief was primarily based upon Brennan's testimony, which largely consisted of the factual account set forth above. The jury found Hansen guilty on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen was sentenced on October 9, 2002. At the sentencing hearing and in a subsequently filed Memorandum dated February 14, 2003, the district court explained its findings. The court grouped Counts 1, 2, and 4 together and determined a base offense level of 43 using the first degree murder guideline. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A1.1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The court then departed downward to an offense level of 33 based upon Hansen's state of mind. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A1.1 cmt. n. 1 (\"The extent of the departure should be based upon the defendant's state of mind (<i>e.g.,</i> recklessness or negligence), the degree of risk inherent in the conduct, and the nature of the underlying offense conduct.\"). A two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice was added because Hansen testified falsely before the grand jury, resulting in a total offense level of 35. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2(c). Because Hansen had a criminal history category of VI, the district court calculated Hansen's guideline sentencing range to be 292 to 365 months. The court sentenced Hansen to a 352-month term of imprisonment (292 months on counts 1, 2, and 4 &#8212; the grouped counts &#8212; and a consecutive term of 60 months on count 3). Five years of supervised release and a restitution payment of $3,775 were also imposed. These appeals followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen appeals both his conviction and sentence, raising no less than eleven points of error. We address each challenge in turn, taking the sentencing issue first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Booker Sentencing Issue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen's first and main line of attack is the fact that the district court sentenced him under the prior mandatory guideline regime. <i>See United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005). Despite his claim to the contrary, however, Hansen did not argue to the district court that the guidelines were unconstitutional or that his sentence violated <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (2000); therefore, his <i>Booker</i> claim is not preserved and thus we review for plain error. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 77 (1st Cir.2005). Under plain error review, Hansen must show \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen is able to meet the first two elements because he was sentenced under a mandatory guideline regime. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 77. The question is whether he is able to show a reasonable probability \"that the sentencing court, freed of the shackles forged by mandatory guidelines, would have fashioned a more favorable sentence.\" <i>United States v. Guzman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201772\"><a href=\"/opinion/201772/united-states-v-guzman/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2005). While we have said that we are not \"overly demanding as to proof of probability,\" <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201512\"><a href=\"/opinion/201512/united-states-v-heldeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 224 (1st Cir.2005), the defendant \"must point to specific indicia\" that reasonable probability exists. <i>United States v. Sanchez-Berrios,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201833\"><a href=\"/opinion/201833/united-states-v-sanchez-berrios/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 80 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support his claim that it is reasonably probable that sentencing under a non-mandatory system would have yielded a different result, Hansen points to the following statement in the district judge's February 14, 2003 sentencing memorandum:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant was 19. The people who enlisted him in stealing the van were at least ten years older, with a brutal reputation in Charlestown. While the law holds Hansen responsible for the foreseeable consequence of his acts, it is clear that his relationship to the armored car robbery that resulted in the tragic murder of Edward Kubera was tenuous. He had, at most, only the most general idea of the plans of Fidler and Bird. He did not know <i>when</i> the robbery would take place, <i>where,</i> or of <i>whom.</i> While Brennan suggests that Hansen knew that guns would be involved &#8212; semi-automatic guns at that &#8212; Hansen had no control over how they would be brandished, or indeed, whether they would be used at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 72 (D.Mass.2003). These comments do suggest that the district judge was sympathetic to Hansen's situation in light of the jury's guilty verdict on Count 3, which held Hansen accountable for the shooting as a \"foreseeable consequence of the use of a firearm in the course of the conspiracy.\" <i>See Pinkerton v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104316\"><a href=\"/opinion/104316/pinkerton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 648, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1489</span></span> (1946). Scrutinized in the context of the entire memorandum, however, the court's statements do little more than explain why it chose to depart downward to the second degree murder guideline (U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A1.2 (base offense level of 33)) instead of using the first degree murder guideline (U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A1.1 (base offense level of 43)). Nothing in the judge's comments imply that she would have imposed a different sentence had she been operating under an advisory guideline regime. In fact, a review of the entire record indicates just the opposite. The district court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this area, the guidelines permit me to make a more nuanced judgment as to what kind of sentence Hansen deserves than the jury did. The jury may have found the killing \"foreseeable\" but I cannot conclude that it was \"intentional.\" If there ever were a case in which the downward departure to a second degree murder guideline was appropriate, it is this one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Hansen,</i> 256 F.Supp.2d at 72. Other comments by the court at the October 9, 2002 sentencing hearing indicate that to the extent the judge felt constrained, it was as a result of the jury's guilty verdict on the conspiracy counts, not the mandatory guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Indeed, the judge's comments indicate that she felt the mandatory guidelines allowed her room to craft an appropriate sentence based upon Hansen's actual role and his state of mind. This is critical because here, in contrast to the vast majority of cases, the applicable guidelines encourage the sentencing judge to choose the most appropriate point along a spectrum, from first degree murder (level 43) to second degree murder (level 33)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> based upon an evaluation of state of mind. The judge exercised this authority by placing the crime at the level she found appropriate (level 33).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But having exercised the authority to depart, the court also made it clear that it would go no lower: \"[t]here's no way I'm going to go below a Level 33.\" It is also clear that the court believed Hansen played a greater role than Brennan in the offenses, and deserved a longer sentence than Brennan's 320 months. As the judge explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the relationship, though, between Mr. Brennan and Mr. Hansen, I agree with the government that I will not give a role adjustment to Mr. Hansen, one that Mr. Brennan got. I do think that, whatever Mr. Brennan might have been involved in in any other situation certainly, he was a lesser participant in this offense than in others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While there is certainly some evidence that the court felt sympathetic for Hansen's situation in light of <i>Pinkerton,</i> based upon this record, there can be little doubt but that Hansen falls short of meeting the burden of showing a reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a more lenient sentence under an advisory guideline regime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Crawford v.

First, for <i>Crawford</i> to apply, the out-of-court statement must be testimonial in nature. <i>See Crawford,</i> 541 U.S. at 56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although the Supreme Court did not define the term \"testimonial,\" it gave us three examples of statements that would be testimonial: ex-parte in-court testimony (or its equivalent); statements contained in formalized documents (such as affidavits and depositions); and statements made as part of a confession resulting from custodial interrogation. <i>See id.</i> at 51-52, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In light of these formulations, we find that, with the exception of Stephen Brennan's recorded statements, the challenged statements are nontestimonial because they are either co-conspirator statements made during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy, or casual remarks which the declarant would not reasonably expect to be available for use at a later trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See Horton v.

We hold that this statement constitutes an explicit withdrawal of the proffered charge on multiple conspiracies, and as such, the issue is waived and may not be revived on appeal. <i>See id.</i> at 437 (finding appellant bound by his express waiver when he deliberately withdrew his objection).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will pause to note, however, as we pass by this claim, even though it is waived, that the evidence adduced at trial overwhelmingly demonstrated that Hansen knew the minivan would be used in the armored truck robbery, knew that guns would be used in the robbery, and expected his payment to depend on the success of the robbery. Accordingly, the district court did not commit plain error as a reasonable jury could not have found more than one illicit agreement or an agreement different than the one charged. <i>See United States v.

Latitude or not, the prosecutor's comments do not constitute improper vouching as they do no more than recite facts that are in evidence &#8212; that Brennan agreed to testify truthfully as part of his plea agreement &#8212; and assert why Brennan should be believed. <i>See Millan,</i> 230 F.3d at 438 n. 6 (finding no error where prosecutor stated \"I submit to you she is testifying, she has a plea agreement, she has kept that plea agreement. . . .

Instead, Hansen must show the evidence to be of such probative value that there is a reasonable probability it would produce a different result. <i>See</i> <i>id.</i> Hansen's attempt to meet this burden falls far short. First, the relevancy of Fidler's erratic behavior in 1998 is, at best, unclear, because it involved armored truck robberies that occurred nearly two years after the robbery at issue here. Second, the evidence is hardly exculpatory &#8212; if anything, it seems to reinforce the notion that Fidler was a consummate gun-toting robber who was highly likely to use stolen vehicles to accomplish his criminal goals.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1180</span></span>. Hansen attacks his conviction under <i>Pinkerton,</i> arguing (1) he was not afforded adequate notice of the essential nature of the charges against him; (2) the evidence does not support a finding that Fidler's use of a firearm to commit armed robbery was reasonably foreseeable to Hansen; and (3) the district court's wording of the <i>Pinkerton</i> instruction was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to notice, the indictment told Hansen that he was being charged in Counts 1-3 for aiding and abetting robbery affecting commerce, conspiring to affect commerce by robbery, and using a firearm during a crime of violence and thereby causing murder. The unambiguous language of the indictment, combined with our decisions which have made abundantly clear that a co-conspirator is liable for acts committed by other members in furtherance of the conspiracy, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Sanchez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550638\"><a href=\"/opinion/550638/united-states-v-edwin-sanchez-united-states-of-america-v-gregorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span>, 612 (1st Cir.1990), convince us that Hansen, represented by experienced defense counsel, suffered no unfair surprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is Hansen able to persuasively challenge the sufficiency of the evidence that was presented against him. The Government's case relied primarily on the damaging testimony of Hansen's childhood friend, Brennan. We previously described their friendship as unfortunate, and undoubtedly it was &#8212; their combined actions resulted in a tragic loss of life and countless other offenses. Their partnership was particularly unfortunate for Hansen, because, as the district court observed, \"[w]ithout Brennan, there was no case.\" <i>Hansen,</i> 256 F.Supp.2d at 69. Brennan's testimony revealed not only that Hansen was aware of the possibility that the minivan might be used in an armed robbery, but that Fidler told him the minivan was needed for an armored car robbery and guns would be used during the robbery. Moreover, Brennan and Hansen discussed how armored car robberies often resulted in killings, and knew their payment was contingent on the success of the heist. Under de novo review and taken in the light most favorable to the jury's guilty verdict, <i>see United States v. Felton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791236\"><a href=\"/opinion/791236/united-states-of-america-appelleecross-appellant-v-leo-v-felton-erica/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 104 (1st Cir.2005), Hansen's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is simply unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because there was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Hansen and others were members of the same underlying conspiracy, the <i>Pinkerton</i> charge to the jury was proper. <i>See United States v.

We, thus, \"are not confronted with the sort of `marginal case' in which the <i>Pinkerton</i> instruction sometimes causes concern.\" <i>Sanchez,</i> 917 F.2d at 612 n. 4 (citation omitted). Additionally, after review of the district court's charge, we find it contains all elements of a standard <i>Pinkerton</i> instruction, including emphasis that the jury was obligated to find each element of <i>Pinkerton</i> beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">G.

Suppression Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Hansen argues that based upon the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, the district court should have suppressed inculpatory evidence, including Hansen's grand jury testimony and the tape recorded conversation with Stephan Brennan. The Government is quick to point out that these arguments are waived as Hansen never moved to suppress this evidence on Fifth and Sixth Amendment grounds, nor did he object to its admission on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(3) requires defendants to file suppression motions prior to trial, and failure to do so constitutes express waiver. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3) and (h). We interpret the mandatory language of Rule 12 broadly to include waiver when a defendant fails to file a motion to suppress before trial, and have even extended waiver to a situation where a suppression motion was filed, but the defendant did not include a particular ground and wished to add it later. <i>See United States v. Santos Batista,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199226\"><a href=\"/opinion/199226/united-states-v-santos-batista/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198221\"><a href=\"/opinion/198221/united-states-v-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case does not fall at the outer bounds of our waiver decisions. Rather, it presents squarely a situation where a defendant has failed altogether to file a motion to suppress below, and as such, we will not consider Hansen's suppression arguments on appeal. <i>See Santos Batista,</i> 239 F.3d at 19-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Leading Questions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen contends that his due process rights were violated by the Government's use of leading questions during its direct examination of Brennan. The Rules of Evidence provide that \"[l]eading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop the witness' testimony.\" Fed.R.Evid. 611(c). \"The evil of leading a friendly witness is that the information conveyed in the questions may supply a false memory.\" <i>United States v. McGovern,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"320450\"><a href=\"/opinion/320450/united-states-v-william-f-mcgovern-united-states-of-america-v-frank-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1140</span></a></span>, 1142 (1st Cir.1974) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). There is, of course, a degree of tolerance for leading questions under certain circumstances. Because it is so case-specific, \"the trial judge is best situated to strike a practical and fair balance\" and is afforded \"extensive discretion over the phrasing of questions.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As proof that the entire trial was unfair, Hansen references two transcript pages, suggesting they contain \"examples\" of the Government's abuse. After reviewing this portion of the transcript, we note that trial counsel did not object to questions as leading and, therefore, review is for plain error. Clearly, there is no plain error; the questions simply do not cross the \"fine line between stimulating an accurate memory and implanting a false one.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government's questions were used primarily to develop coherent testimony from Brennan. This was especially important here because, based upon Hansen and Brennan's long criminal history together, there was a risk of eliciting highly prejudicial (and ultimately irrelevant) information from Brennan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Moreover, we note that defense counsel engaged in a thorough cross-examination of Brennan, which enabled the jury to assess appropriately Brennan's testimony. <i>See United States v. Noone,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547469\"><a href=\"/opinion/547469/united-states-v-peter-noone/\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.1990) (considering defense counsel's thorough cross-examination in deciding that no prejudicial error occurred from use of a leading question). Thus, reversal is not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen's argument also alludes to leading questions outside of his general examples. We decline the invitation to mind read, however, and instead find that such claim of error is inadequately developed on appeal. <i>See United States v. Bongiorno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"735399\"><a href=\"/opinion/735399/united-states-v-frank-p-bongiorno-united-states-of-america-v-frank-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1027</span></a></span>, 1034 (1st Cir.1997) (stating that issues are waived when \"raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not accompanied by developed argumentation\"). Even so, in the majority of instances, no objection was made below and were we to review, it would again be for plain error &#8212; an insurmountable hurdle considering Hansen has made little, if any, effort to show that such error likely affected the outcome below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">J. Juror Note</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hansen claims that he was denied a fair trial because during trial the jury expressed general concerns about privacy. Once again, the piers of Hansen's argument are undermined by waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 23, 2002, the court received the following note from juror number two:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury in general was concerned about safety in regard to our names having been used on Monday in front of the defendant and also, just in general we'd just like affirmation that no witnesses, etc. will know our names.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, defense counsel broached the idea of excusing this juror because counsel was concerned that the expression of fear showed that she had prejudged Hansen. Defense counsel elaborated: \"If it's just a general feeling that the jurors have, fine, that may well be cured by an instruction.\" The court agreed and proposed a curative instruction to the attorneys, to which defense counsel responded, \"Something along those lines, Judge, fine.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court, along with counsel, met with juror number two, and learned that, in fact, the general concerns expressed in the note were those of the jury as a whole, and had blossomed prior to the start of evidence (and, therefore, had no specific reference to Hansen or his activities). This conversation apparently appeased Hansen's attorney, who withdrew his objection to juror number two by stating, \"Given the young lady's remarks, your Honor, I think an instruction from you will be curative at this point.\" The court then gave an instruction to the jury which was substantially similar to the proposed instruction previously agreed to. The defense interposed no objection to this instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this record, it is clear that trial counsel diligently raised potential juror issues with the district court. We decline, however, to revisit them on appeal because counsel affirmatively withdrew any objections to juror number two, and specifically agreed to the court's curative instruction. <i>See, e.g., Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d at 437. Nonetheless, we believe that the district court, utilizing its considerable discretion in fashioning curative instructions, took appropriate measures to maintain the integrity of Hansen's right to a fair trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">K. Inconsistent Theories</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As his final claim of error, Hansen argues that the Government presented factually inconsistent theories during its prosecutions of Hansen and Brennan. Based upon the record before us, we disagree. Hansen seems to take issue with the fact that during Brennan's case, the Government concentrated on Brennan's role in the offenses, and vice versa in Hansen's case. There is nothing inconsistent about this approach. In fact, in both instances the Government theorized the existence of a conspiracy to steal a minivan for use in an armed robbery. The Government eventually learned that the minivan theft resulted from the concerted efforts of Hansen and Brennan on the night of July 27, 1996. Of course, the full extent of Hansen's involvement was unearthed after Brennan's conviction, so it is not surprising that the Government's theory at Hansen's trial had a slightly different gloss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we find Hansen's last challenge to be wholly without merit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The stolen vehicles were primarily used for joy-riding, stripping and selling parts, or to help individuals commit insurance fraud</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Police found a white minivan near the Twin City Plaza with damage to the door locks and steering column.

Thereafter, Hansen filed a motion for new trial pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33, which the district court denied on January 25, 2005. Hansen then filed another notice of appeal on March 7, 2005, which was docketed in this court as No. 05-1414 and consolidated with No. 03-1331</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> There, the district court stated, \"I don't think that,<i>given what the jury has found,</i> that I have much leeway in the sentence.\" (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> While the guidelines do not explicitly foreclose going below level 33, \"the Commission does not envision that departure below that specified in &#167; 2A1.2 (Second Degree Murder) is likely to be appropriate.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A1.1, cmt. n. 1</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Hansen, while making generalized statements of \"multi-level hearsay,\" only raises constitutional<i>Crawford</i> challenges.
