We affirm substantially for the reasons given in the\n\nTax Court's memorandum opinion dated February 15, 2005, which\n\nthoroughly explained why summary judgment in the government's favor\n\nwas appropriate and why Kilgore should be sanctioned.\n\n          The    government     has   filed      an   unopposed    motion     for\n\nsanctions, alleging that this appeal was frivolous.               We grant the\n\nmotion, albeit in a lesser amount than was requested by the\n\ngovernment.   Kilgore advanced numerous contentions on appeal; none\n\nhad any objective chance of success, and many have long been\n\nrejected by the courts as frivolous.             A sanction is appropriate.\n\nSee Marino v.
