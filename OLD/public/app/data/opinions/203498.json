Zulkifly Kadri, a Muslim\n\nnative of Indonesia, came to the United States on a non-immigrant\n\nvisa.     He filed a petition for asylum on the ground that he was\n\npersecuted in Indonesia because of his sexual orientation.                 He\n\nasserted that he was ostracized in the workplace and prevented from\n\nearning a livelihood as a medical doctor; and that he fears that if\n\nreturned to Indonesia, he would face continued persecution.                An\n\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\") found him credible, found that he belonged\n\nto   a   particular   social   group,    and   granted   him   asylum.    The\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") appealed to the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), and the BIA reversed the decision of\n\nthe IJ.    Kadri petitions for a review of the BIA's decision.           After\n\ncareful consideration, we grant the petition and remand.\n\n                               I.    Background\n\n            \"We summarize the evidence as [Kadri] presented it to the\n\nIJ in [his] testimony and in the affidavit accompanying [his]\n\nasylum application; we then consider the IJ's and BIA's findings in\n\nrelation to that evidence.\"         Sok v. Mukasey, 526 F.3d 48, 50 (1st\n\nCir. 2008) (citing Mihaylov v. Ashcroft, 379 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n2004)).     Kadri worked as a doctor in Jakarta, Indonesia at the\n\nUsada Insani Hospital from 1992 until 2001, and at the Abdul Rahman\n\nClinic from 1997 until 1999.           In 1999, Kadri testified that the\n\nowner of the Abdul Rahman Clinic fired him because he heard rumors\n\nthat he was a homosexual.           According to Kadri, the owner of the\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fclinic said      that he could not \"tolerate [Kadri's homosexual]\n\nbehavior.\"\n\n            In May 2001, the board of the Usada Insani Hospital\n\nsummoned Kadri and asked him about rumors that he was a homosexual.\n\nHe refused to answer their questions and informed the board that\n\nhis sexual orientation was a private matter. The next month, Kadri\n\ntestified that he was verbally assaulted by a regular client whose\n\nextended family he knew well.      In a crowded emergency room, the\n\nwoman screamed over and over again:     \"Get out, faggot, and don't\n\ntouch my son.\"    Following this incident, other patients refused to\n\nbe seen by Kadri.     The hospital board again asked Kadri about his\n\nsexual orientation;    again, he refused to answer, reiterating that\n\ntheir questions had nothing to do with his responsibilities as a\n\ndoctor.     The hospital asked him to voluntarily resign, but he\n\nrefused.     Though Kadri retained his job at the hospital, he was\n\nonly paid a base salary of about $10 a month because he was not\n\nassigned any patients.    Following these incidents, word spread to\n\nKadri's colleagues that he was a homosexual; his colleagues avoided\n\nhim and refused to talk to him.\n\n            Kadri retained a lawyer and filed a lawsuit against the\n\nhospital.    Kadri asserts that the judge was merely interested in\n\nhis sexual orientation and not in how he performed at the hospital.\n\nEven though his lawyer objected to the line of questioning by\n\nopposing counsel and the judge regarding Kadri's sexual orientation\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fand private life, the judge demanded to know if Kadri was a\n\nhomosexual.      Kadri testified that he felt \"torture[d] mentally\" by\n\nthe judge and, thus, dropped his case.\n\n              Kadri entered the United States on a non-immigrant visa\n\non May 16, 2002, and he was authorized to remain in the United\n\nStates until November 15, 2002.              Kadri filed an I-589 asylum\n\napplication with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")\n\n-- now DHS -- while he was still lawfully in the United States.                 In\n\nhis application, Kadri stated that he is a homosexual and that he\n\nwas seeking asylum based on his membership in a particular social\n\ngroup.    He was interviewed by an asylum officer who referred his\n\napplication to the immigration court.                  At the hearing, Kadri\n\nrecounted his experiences at the clinic and hospital. He presented\n\nevidence that described the social climate for homosexuals in\n\nIndonesia and how they have been treated in society generally and\n\nby the government in particular.          Kadri also submitted two letters\n\nto the IJ from former colleagues -- one from the hospital and one\n\nfrom   the    clinic    --   confirming   that   his     problems   at   the   two\n\nfacilities resulted from rumors that he was a homosexual.\n\n              Kadri testified that he did not attempt to open his own\n\nmedical      practice   in   Indonesia    because   of    the   difficulty     and\n\nbarriers to opening a private practice. He also testified that the\n\nmedical community is small and insular and that the rumors about\n\nhis sexual orientation were already rampant within a professional\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fcommunity where \"[e]verybody knows everybody.\"                         Kadri testified\n\nthat it would not have mattered if he had moved to a different part\n\nof Indonesia given the size and intimacy of the medical community;\n\nthe rumors about his sexual orientation would follow him anywhere\n\nin the country.            He noted that the medical community is like \"a big\n\nfamily in Indonesia, and so everywhere I go, I still can find my\n\n.    .    .   colleagues       there.      I    still    can   find    my   classmate[s]\n\neverywhere, so anywhere I go this story will follow[] me.\"\n\n                  The    IJ   found   Kadri     credible    and   concluded     that   he\n\nsuffered past persecution because he was deprived of the ability to\n\nearn a living.            After reviewing the evidence in the record, the IJ\n\nconcluded that Kadri met his burden of proving a well-founded fear\n\nof       future    persecution.         The     IJ   specifically      found   that    \"in\n\nIndonesia [there is] an attitude, atmosphere, and an environment of\n\nhostility towards the gay community, which is so discriminatory and\n\nso pervasive as to rise to the level of persecution.\" Furthermore,\n\nthe IJ found that a reasonable person in Kadri's situation would\n\nfear persecution.             For these reasons, he granted asylum.              The DHS\n\nappealed the grant of asylum to the BIA, and the BIA reversed by a\n\nvote of two to one.                 The BIA majority disagreed with the IJ's\n\nconclusions             regarding     Kadri's    claim     that   he    suffered      past\n\npersecution, holding that \"the economic deprivation described by\n\n\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\fthe respondent does not compel a finding of past persecution.\"1\n\nNoting that \"closeted homosexuality is tolerated in Indonesia\" and\n\nthat the State Department's human rights report does not mention\n\nviolence against homosexuals, the majority concluded that Kadri did\n\nnot present sufficient evidence of a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.    Kadri filed a motion to reconsider, but the BIA\n\ndenied the motion.   Kadri petitions for review.2\n\n                           II.   Discussion\n\n          A.   Standard of Review\n\n          This court reviews the factual findings of the BIA for\n\nsubstantial evidence.    Orelien v. Gonzáles, 467 F.3d 67, 70 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).    The BIA's fact-based determinations should be upheld\n\nunless a \"reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to\n\nthe contrary.\" Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).    \"Put\n\nanother way, the BIA's findings of fact must be accepted as long as\n\nthey are 'supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative\n\nevidence on the record considered as a whole.'\" Id. (quoting I.N.S.\n\nv. Elías-Zacarías, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992)); accord Hernández-\n\nBarrera v. Ashcroft, 373 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir. 2004).       We will\n\n\n\n1\n   The dissenting panel member concluded that \"it is not apparent\nthat [the IJ] employed the correct standard\" for economic\npersecution and would have remanded on that basis; he expressed no\nview on Kadri's claim of future persecution.\n2\n    The National Lawyers Guild, the Gay & Lesbian Advocates &\nDefenders, and the National Immigrant Project submitted an amicus\nbrief in support of Kadri.\n\n                                  -6-\n\freverse the BIA if a petitioner \"show[s] that the evidence he\n\npresented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could\n\nfail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\"          Elías-Zacarías,\n\n502 U.S. at 483-84; accord Quevedo v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 39, 43\n\n(1st Cir. 2003). Generally, the BIA is prohibited from \"engag[ing]\n\nin factfinding in the course of deciding appeals.\"              8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.1(d)(3)(iv).       \"Facts determined by the immigration judge,\n\nincluding findings as to the credibility of testimony, shall be\n\nreviewed only to determine whether the findings of the immigration\n\njudge are clearly erroneous.\"        Id. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).3    The BIA's\n\nlegal conclusions are reviewed de novo, but we give appropriate\n\ndeference to its interpretations of the governing statute. See Lin\n\nv. Mukasey, 521 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing Albathani v.\n\nI.N.S., 318 F.3d 365, 372 (1st Cir. 2003)).\n\n          B.     Applicable Law\n\n          The Attorney General has the discretion to grant an\n\nalien   asylum    if   the   alien   is    a   refugee.   See   8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(b)(1)(A).       A \"'refugee'\" is any person outside his or her\n\nhome country \"who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is\n\nunable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection\n\nof, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership\n\n\n3\n  Kadri argues that the BIA did not apply the appropriate standard\nunder this regulation; however, we need not decide this issue\nbecause we remand on other grounds.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fin   a   particular    social    group,      or    political   opinion.\"       Id.\n\n§ 1101(a)(42)(A); accord Ravindran v. I.N.S., 976 F.2d 754, 758\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).      To qualify as persecution, the government \"must\n\nbe the source of or at least acquiesce in the persecution[,] . . .\n\nor there must be some showing that the persecution is due to the\n\ngovernment's unwillingness or inability to control the conduct of\n\nprivate actors.\"       Jorgji v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 53, 57 (1st Cir.\n\n2008) (citing Orelien, 467 F.3d at 72).                A petitioner bears the\n\nburden of proof that he or she qualifies as a refugee.                       See 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1208.13(a); see also Sok, 526 F.3d at 53.\n\n            If a petitioner can demonstrate that she was persecuted\n\nin the past, the applicable regulation affords her a rebuttable\n\npresumption that she will likely be persecuted if she were returned\n\nto her country of origin.         See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1); Sok, 526\n\nF.3d at 53 (citing Rotinsulu v. Mukasey, 515 F.3d 68, 71-72 (1st\n\nCir. 2008)).   The burden then shifts to the Government to rebut the\n\npresumption    of    future    persecution        through   proof   of   either   a\n\nfundamental change in circumstances eliminating the likelihood of\n\npersecution,    or    a     showing   that    the     petitioner    could    avoid\n\npersecution by moving elsewhere in his or her country. 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A)-(B); accord Rotinsulu, 515 F.3d at 72.                      A\n\npetitioner    may    also    establish    asylum     eligibility     based   on   a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution, independently of past\n\npersecution, by demonstrating that the fear is both subjectively\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fgenuine and objectively reasonable.        See Da Silva v. Ashcroft, 394\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n              We must remand the case for further proceedings if the\n\nagency's decision \"fails to state 'with sufficient particularity\n\nand clarity the reasons for denial of asylum' or otherwise to\n\n'offer legally sufficient reasons for [the] decision.'\"          Mihaylov,\n\n379 F.3d at 21 (quoting Gailius v. I.N.S., 147 F.3d 34, 46-47 (1st\n\nCir. 1998)).\n\n              C.    Economic Persecution\n\n              The Immigration and Nationality Act does not define\n\npersecution, and we have said that the term \"is a protean word,\n\ncapable of many meanings.\"        Bocova v. Gonzáles, 412 F.3d 257, 263\n\n(1st Cir. 2005). Generally, persecution is more than discrimination\n\nand   rises     above    unpleasantness,   harassment,   and   even   basic\n\nsuffering.         See Sharari v. Gonzáles, 407 F.3d 467, 475 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   We have held, however, that \"mistreatment can constitute\n\npersecution even though it does not embody a direct and unremitting\n\nthreat to life or freedom.\"        Bocova, 412 F.3d at 263.\n\n              Sexual orientation can serve as the foundation for a\n\nclaim of persecution, as it is the basis for inclusion in a\n\nparticular social group.        See Karouni v. Gonzáles, 399 F.3d 1163,\n\n1172 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing Hernández-Montiel v. I.N.S., 225 F.3d\n\n1084, 1091, 1094-95 (9th Cir. 2000)); Amanfi v. Ashcroft, 328 F.3d\n\n719, 724 (3d Cir. 2003); see also Suzanne B. Goldberg, Give Me\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fLiberty    or   Give    Me   Death:      Political    Asylum      and   the   Global\n\nPersecution of Lesbians and Gay Men, 26 Cornell Int'l L.J. 605,\n\n609-12    (1993)   (discussing        homosexuals    as    a   particular     social\n\ngroup).    Kadri listed his membership in a particular social group,\n\nin general, and his sexual orientation, in particular, as the basis\n\nfor persecution in his asylum application.                     The IJ found him\n\ncredible and determined that he is a homosexual; the BIA did not\n\ndisturb this finding and acknowledged that sexual orientation is a\n\nbasis for inclusion in a particular social group.\n\n            Kadri argues -- and the IJ found -- that he suffered\n\neconomic persecution because he could not earn a living as a\n\nmedical doctor.        The BIA majority reversed the decision of the IJ.\n\nIt noted that Kadri was never physically injured, arrested, or\n\nimprisoned, and concluded that \"the economic deprivations [Kadri]\n\nsuffered as a result of his sexual orientation . . . do not amount\n\nto persecution.\" Moreover, Kadri had not met his burden of showing\n\na well-founded fear of future persecution.                 The dissenting panel\n\nmember,    however,     would   have    remanded     the   case    to   the   IJ    to\n\ndetermine whether Kadri suffered past economic persecution.                        The\n\ndissenting member noted that \"it is not apparent that [the IJ]\n\nemployed the correct standard\" for economic persecution, which the\n\ndissent described as being set forth in Matter of Acosta, 19 I. &\n\nN. Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985), overruled on other grounds by Matter\n\nof Mogharrabi, 19 I. & N. Dec. 439 (BIA 1987), abrogated on other\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fgrounds by Pitcherskaia v. I.N.S., 118 F.3d 641, 647-48 (9th Cir.\n\n1997).   He also noted that it was not clear that we have endorsed\n\nthe Acosta standard.\n\n          Although the BIA dissent relied upon Matter of Acosta for\n\nits standard of economic persecution,4 neither the BIA majority nor\n\nthe IJ stated what standard was used to reject Kadri's economic\n\npersecution claim.   The BIA and our sister circuits have not been\n\nconsistent in articulating such a standard.     Indeed, the Second\n\nCircuit in Mirzoyan v. Gonzáles, 457 F.3d 217, 222-23 (2d Cir.\n\n2006)(per curiam), remanded its case to the BIA to clarify the\n\napplicable standard, noting that the BIA has applied at least three\n\ndifferent standards for economic persecution over the years.   The\n\nBIA responded to this instruction in In re T-Z-, 24 I & N. Dec. 163\n\n(BIA 2007).   Citing a prior case that had relied upon a 1978 House\n\nof Representatives Report, the BIA in In re T-Z-   articulated the\n\nfollowing standard for economic persecution: \"[Nonphysical] harm or\n\nsuffering . . . such as the deliberate imposition of severe\n\neconomic disadvantage or the deprivation of liberty, food, housing,\n\nemployment, or other essentials of life\" may rise to persecution.\n\nId. at 171 (emphasis in original)(quoting H.R. Rep. No. 95-1452, as\n\n\n4\n   In Matter of Acosta, the petitioner argued that he was eligible\nfor asylum because he claimed to have been deprived of his ability\nto earn a living. See 19 I. & N. Dec. at 217. Though the BIA\ndismissed the petition, it noted that \"persecution . . . could\nconsist of economic deprivation or restrictions so severe that they\nconstitute a threat to an individual's life or freedom.\" Id. at\n222.\n\n                               -11-\n\freprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4700, 4704, available at 1978 WL\n\n8575).\n\n           In light of the intervening decision in In re T-Z-, and\n\nbecause we are unable to determine what standard the agency used in\n\nrejecting Kadri's economic persecution claim, we remand the case to\n\nthe BIA to instruct the IJ to evaluate Kadri's case under the In re\n\nT-Z- standard.   See Manzur v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 494 F.3d\n\n281, 295 (2d Cir. 2007).    Based on his testimony and the evidence\n\nhe submitted, Kadri may be able to sustain a claim for economic\n\npersecution.   However, that is not the issue before us.   Nor do we\n\nneed to address the merits of whether the BIA's new standard, under\n\nIn re T-Z-, survives Chevron review.5\n\n                           III.   Conclusion\n\n           For the reasons stated above, we grant Kadri's petition\n\nfor review, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.       The BIA's order of removal is\n\nvacated.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n5\n    Kadri maintains that he has a well-founded fear of future\npersecution in Indonesia on account of his sexual orientation.\nBecause we remand on other grounds, we do not reach the issue of\nwhether Kadri has a well-founded fear of future persecution at this\ntime.\n\n                                  -12-\n\f",

He filed a petition for asylum on the ground that he was persecuted in Indonesia because of his sexual orientation. He asserted that he was ostracized in the workplace and prevented from earning a livelihood as a medical doctor; and that he fears that if returned to Indonesia, he would face continued persecution. An Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") found him credible, found that he belonged to a particular social group, and granted him asylum. The Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), and the BIA reversed the decision of the IJ. Kadri petitions for a review of the BIA's decision. After careful consideration, we grant the petition and remand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>\"We summarize the evidence as [Kadri] presented it to the IJ in [his] testimony and in the affidavit accompanying [his] asylum application; we then consider the IJ's and BIA's findings in relation to that evidence.\" <i>Sok v. Mukasey,</i> 526 F.3d 48, 50 (1st Cir.2008) (citing <i>Mihaylov v. Ashcroft,</i> 379 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.2004)). Kadri worked as a doctor in Jakarta, Indonesia at the Usada Insani Hospital from 1992 until 2001, and at the Abdul Rahman Clinic from 1997 until 1999. In 1999, Kadri testified that the owner of the Abdul Rahman Clinic fired him because he heard rumors that he was a homosexual. According to Kadri, the owner of the clinic said that he could not \"tolerate [Kadri's homosexual] behavior.\"</p>\n<p>In May 2001, the board of the Usada Insani Hospital summoned Kadri and asked him about rumors that he was a homosexual. He refused to answer their questions and informed the board that his sexual orientation was a private matter. The next month, Kadri testified that he was verbally assaulted by a regular client whose extended family he knew well. In a crowded emergency room, the woman screamed over and over again: \"Get out, faggot, and don't touch my son.\" Following this incident, other patients refused to be seen by Kadri. The hospital board again asked Kadri about his sexual orientation; again, he refused to answer, reiterating <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> that their questions had nothing to do with his responsibilities as a doctor. The hospital asked him to voluntarily resign, but he refused. Though Kadri retained his job at the hospital, he was only paid a base salary of about $10 a month because he was not assigned any patients. Following these incidents, word spread to Kadri's colleagues that he was a homosexual; his colleagues avoided him and refused to talk to him.</p>\n<p>Kadri retained a lawyer and filed a lawsuit against the hospital. Kadri asserts that the judge was merely interested in his sexual orientation and not in how he performed at the hospital. Even though his lawyer objected to the line of questioning by opposing counsel and the judge regarding Kadri's sexual orientation and private life, the judge demanded to know if Kadri was a homosexual. Kadri testified that he felt \"torture[d] mentally\" by the judge and, thus, dropped his case.</p>\n<p>Kadri entered the United States on a non-immigrant visa on May 16, 2002, and he was authorized to remain in the United States until November 15, 2002. Kadri filed an I-589 asylum application with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")now DHSwhile he was still lawfully in the United States. In his application, Kadri stated that he is a homosexual and that he was seeking asylum based on his membership in a particular social group. He was interviewed by an asylum officer who referred his application to the immigration court. At the hearing, Kadri recounted his experiences at the clinic and hospital. He presented evidence that described the social climate for homosexuals in Indonesia and how they have been treated in society generally and by the government in particular. Kadri also submitted two letters to the IJ from former colleaguesone from the hospital and one from the clinicconfirming that his problems at the two facilities resulted from rumors that he was a homosexual.</p>\n<p>Kadri testified that he did not attempt to open his own medical practice in Indonesia because of the difficulty and barriers to opening a private practice. He also testified that the medical community is small and insular and that the rumors about his sexual orientation were already rampant within a professional community where \"[e]verybody knows everybody.\" Kadri testified that it would not have mattered if he had moved to a different part of Indonesia given the size and intimacy of the medical community; the rumors about his sexual orientation would follow him anywhere in the country. He noted that the medical community is like \"a big family in Indonesia, and so everywhere I go, I still can find my ... colleagues there. I still can find my classmate[s] everywhere, so anywhere I go this story will follow[ ] me.\"</p>\n<p>The IJ found Kadri credible and concluded that he suffered past persecution because he was deprived of the ability to earn a living. After reviewing the evidence in the record, the IJ concluded that Kadri met his burden of proving a well-founded fear of future persecution. The IJ specifically found that \"in Indonesia [there is] an attitude, atmosphere, and an environment of hostility towards the gay community, which is so discriminatory and so pervasive as to rise to the level of persecution.\" Furthermore, the IJ found that a reasonable person in Kadri's situation would fear persecution. For these reasons, he granted asylum. The DHS appealed the grant of asylum to the BIA, and the BIA reversed by a vote of two to one. The BIA majority disagreed with the IJ's conclusions regarding Kadri's claim that he suffered past persecution, holding that \"the economic deprivation described by the respondent does not compel a finding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> of past persecution.\"<sup>[1]</sup> Noting that \"closeted homosexuality is tolerated in Indonesia\" and that the State Department's human rights report does not mention violence against homosexuals, the majority concluded that Kadri did not present sufficient evidence of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Kadri filed a motion to reconsider, but the BIA denied the motion. Kadri petitions for review.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>This court reviews the factual findings of the BIA for substantial evidence. <i>Orelien v. Gonzáles,</i> 467 F.3d 67, 70 (1st Cir.2006). The BIA's fact-based determinations should be upheld unless a \"reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" <i>Id.</i> (quotation marks and citation omitted). \"Put another way, the BIA's findings of fact must be accepted as long as they are 'supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>I.N.S. v. Elías-Zacarías,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)); <i>accord </i><i>Hernández-Barrera v. Ashcroft,</i> 373 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir.2004). We will reverse the BIA if a petitioner \"show[s] that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\" <i>Elías-Zacarías,</i> 502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812; <i>accord </i><i>Quevedo v. Ashcroft,</i> 336 F.3d 39, 43 (1st Cir.2003). Generally, the BIA is prohibited from \"engag[ing] in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). \"Facts determined by the immigration judge, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, shall be reviewed only to determine whether the findings of the immigration judge are clearly erroneous.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).<sup>[3]</sup> The BIA's legal conclusions are reviewed <i>de novo,</i> but we give appropriate deference to its interpretations of the governing statute. <i>See </i><i>Lin v. Mukasey,</i> 521 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir.2008) (citing <i>Albathani v. I.N.S.,</i> 318 F.3d 365, 372 (1st Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Applicable Law</h2>\n<p>The Attorney General has the discretion to grant an alien asylum if the alien is a refugee. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A). A \"`refugee'\" is any person outside his or her home country \"who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1101(a)(42)(A); <i>accord </i><i>Ravindran v. I.N.S.,</i> 976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir.1992). To qualify as persecution, the government \"must be the source of or at least acquiesce in the persecution[,]... or there must be some showing that the persecution is due to the government's unwillingness or inability to control the conduct of private actors.\" <i>Jorgji v. Mukasey,</i> 514 F.3d 53, 57 (1st Cir.2008) (citing <i>Orelien,</i> 467 F.3d at 72). A petitioner <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> bears the burden of proof that he or she qualifies as a refugee. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a); <i>see also </i><i>Sok,</i> 526 F.3d at 53.</p>\n<p>If a petitioner can demonstrate that she was persecuted in the past, the applicable regulation affords her a rebuttable presumption that she will likely be persecuted if she were returned to her country of origin. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1); <i>Sok,</i> 526 F.3d at 53 (citing <i>Rotinsulu v. Mukasey,</i> 515 F.3d 68, 71-72 (1st Cir.2008)). The burden then shifts to the Government to rebut the presumption of future persecution through proof of either a fundamental change in circumstances eliminating the likelihood of persecution, or a showing that the petitioner could avoid persecution by moving elsewhere in his or her country. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A)-(B); <i>accord </i><i>Rotinsulu,</i> 515 F.3d at 72. A petitioner may also establish asylum eligibility based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, independently of past persecution, by demonstrating that the fear is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <i>See </i><i>Da Silva v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>We must remand the case for further proceedings if the agency's decision \"fails to state `with sufficient particularity and clarity the reasons for denial of asylum' or otherwise to 'offer legally sufficient reasons for [the] decision.'\" <i>Mihaylov,</i> 379 F.3d at 21 (quoting <i>Gailius v. I.N.S.,</i> 147 F.3d 34, 46-47 (1st Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Economic Persecution</h2>\n<p>The Immigration and Nationality Act does not define persecution, and we have said that the term \"is a protean word, capable of many meanings.\" <i>Bocova v. Gonzáles,</i> 412 F.3d 257, 263 (1st Cir.2005). Generally, persecution is more than discrimination and rises above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering. <i>See </i><i>Sharari v. Gonzáles,</i> 407 F.3d 467, 475 (1st Cir.2005). We have held, however, that \"mistreatment can constitute persecution even though it does not embody a direct and unremitting threat to life or freedom.\" <i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 263.</p>\n<p>Sexual orientation can serve as the foundation for a claim of persecution, as it is the basis for inclusion in a particular social group. <i>See </i><i>Karouni v. Gonzáles,</i> 399 F.3d 1163, 1172 (9th Cir.2005) (citing <i>Hernández-Montiel v. I.N.S.,</i> 225 F.3d 1084, 1091, 1094-95 (9th Cir.2000)); <i>Amanfi v. Ashcroft,</i> 328 F.3d 719, 724 (3d Cir.2003); <i>see also</i> Suzanne B. Goldberg, <i>Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death: Political Asylum and the Global Persecution of Lesbians and Gay Men,</i> 26 Cornell Int'l L.J. 605, 609-12 (1993) (discussing homosexuals as a particular social group). Kadri listed his membership in a particular social group, in general, and his sexual orientation, in particular, as the basis for persecution in his asylum application. The IJ found him credible and determined that he is a homosexual; the BIA did not disturb this finding and acknowledged that sexual orientation is a basis for inclusion in a particular social group.</p>\n<p>Kadri arguesand the IJ foundthat he suffered economic persecution because he could not earn a living as a medical doctor. The BIA majority reversed the decision of the IJ. It noted that Kadri was never physically injured, arrested, or imprisoned, and concluded that \"the economic deprivations [Kadri] suffered as a result of his sexual orientation ... do not amount to persecution.\" Moreover, Kadri had not met his burden of showing a well-founded fear of future persecution. The dissenting panel member, however, would have remanded the case to the IJ to determine whether Kadri suffered past economic persecution. The dissenting member noted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> that \"it is not apparent that [the IJ] employed the correct standard\" for economic persecution, which the dissent described as being set forth in <i>Matter of Acosta,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985), <i>overruled on other grounds by </i><i>Matter of Mogharrabi,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 439 (BIA 1987), <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>Pitcherskaia v. I.N.S.,</i> 118 F.3d 641, 647-48 (9th Cir.1997). He also noted that it was not clear that we have endorsed the <i>Acosta</i> standard.</p>\n<p>Although the BIA dissent relied upon <i>Matter of Acosta</i> for its standard of economic persecution,<sup>[4]</sup> neither the BIA majority nor the IJ stated what standard was used to reject Kadri's economic persecution claim. The BIA and our sister circuits have not been consistent in articulating such a standard. Indeed, the Second Circuit in <i>Mirzoyan v. Gonzáles,</i> 457 F.3d 217, 222-23 (2d Cir.2006)(per curiam), remanded its case to the BIA to clarify the applicable standard, noting that the BIA has applied at least three different standards for economic persecution over the years. The BIA responded to this instruction in <i>In re T-Z-,</i> 24 I &amp; N. Dec. 163 (BIA 2007). Citing a prior case that had relied upon a 1978 House of Representatives Report, the BIA in <i>In re T-Z-</i> articulated the following standard for economic persecution: \"[Nonphysical] harm or suffering... <i>such as the deliberate imposition of severe economic disadvantage or the deprivation of liberty, food, housing, employment, or other essentials of life</i>\" may rise to persecution. <i>Id.</i> at 171 (emphasis in original)(quoting H.R.Rep. No. 95-1452, <i>as reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4700, 4704, <i>available at</i> 1978 WL 8575).</p>\n<p>In light of the intervening decision in <i>In re T-Z-,</i> and because we are unable to determine what standard the agency used in rejecting Kadri's economic persecution claim, we remand the case to the BIA to instruct the IJ to evaluate Kadri's case under the <i>In re T-Z-</i> standard. <i>See </i><i>Manzur v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</i> 494 F.3d 281, 295 (2d Cir.2007). Based on his testimony and the evidence he submitted, Kadri may be able to sustain a claim for economic persecution. However, that is not the issue before us. Nor do we need to address the merits of whether the BIA's new standard, under <i>In re T-Z-,</i> survives <i>Chevron</i> review.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, we <i>grant</i> Kadri's petition for review, and the case is <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The BIA's order of removal is <i>vacated.</i></p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The dissenting panel member concluded that \"it is not apparent that [the IJ] employed the correct standard\" for economic persecution and would have remanded on that basis; he expressed no view on Kadri's claim of future persecution.</p>\n<p>[2]  The National Lawyers Guild, the Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders, and the National Immigrant Project submitted an amicus brief in support of Kadri.</p>\n<p>[3]  Kadri argues that the BIA did not apply the appropriate standard under this regulation; however, we need not decide this issue because we remand on other grounds.</p>\n<p>[4]  In <i>Matter of Acosta,</i> the petitioner argued that he was eligible for asylum because he claimed to have been deprived of his ability to earn a living. <i>See</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 217. Though the BIA dismissed the petition, it noted that \"persecution ... could consist of economic deprivation or restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to an individual's life or freedom.\" <i>Id.</i> at 222.</p>\n<p>[5]  Kadri maintains that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution in Indonesia on account of his sexual orientation. Because we remand on other grounds, we do not reach the issue of whether Kadri has a well-founded fear of future persecution at this time.</p>\n\n</div>",

Generally, the BIA is prohibited from \"engag[ing] in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). \"Facts determined by the immigration judge, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, shall be reviewed only to determine whether the findings of the immigration judge are clearly erroneous.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).<sup>[3]</sup> The BIA's legal conclusions are reviewed <i>de novo,</i> but we give appropriate deference to its interpretations of the governing statute. <i>See </i><i>Lin v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203205\"><a href=\"/opinion/203205/lin-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2008) (citing <i>Albathani v.

Applicable Law</h2>\n<p>The Attorney General has the discretion to grant an alien asylum if the alien is a refugee. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A). A \"`refugee'\" is any person outside his or her home country \"who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1101(a)(42)(A); <i>accord </i><i>Ravindran v. I.N.S.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592069\"><a href=\"/opinion/592069/valli-kandiah-ravindran-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 758 (1st Cir.1992). To qualify as persecution, the government \"must be the source of or at least acquiesce in the persecution[,]... or there must be some showing that the persecution is due to the government's unwillingness or inability to control the conduct of private actors.\" <i>Jorgji v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1386154\"><a href=\"/opinion/1386154/jorgji-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir.2008) (citing <i>Orelien,</i> 467 F.3d at 72). A petitioner <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> bears the burden of proof that he or she qualifies as a refugee. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a); <i>see also </i><i>Sok,</i> 526 F.3d at 53.</p>\n<p>If a petitioner can demonstrate that she was persecuted in the past, the applicable regulation affords her a rebuttable presumption that she will likely be persecuted if she were returned to her country of origin. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1); <i>Sok,</i> 526 F.3d at 53 (citing <i>Rotinsulu v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></span>, 71-72 (1st Cir.2008)). The burden then shifts to the Government to rebut the presumption of future persecution through proof of either a fundamental change in circumstances eliminating the likelihood of persecution, or a showing that the petitioner could avoid persecution by moving elsewhere in his or her country. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A)-(B); <i>accord </i><i>Rotinsulu,</i> 515 F.3d at 72. A petitioner may also establish asylum eligibility based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, independently of past persecution, by demonstrating that the fear is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <i>See </i><i>Da Silva v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201398\"><a href=\"/opinion/201398/da-silva-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>We must remand the case for further proceedings if the agency's decision \"fails to state `with sufficient particularity and clarity the reasons for denial of asylum' or otherwise to 'offer legally sufficient reasons for [the] decision.'\" <i>Mihaylov,</i> 379 F.3d at 21 (quoting <i>Gailius v. I.N.S.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198026\"><a href=\"/opinion/198026/ins-v-gailius/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 46-47 (1st Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Economic Persecution</h2>\n<p>The Immigration and Nationality Act does not define persecution, and we have said that the term \"is a protean word, capable of many meanings.\" <i>Bocova v. Gonzáles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201655\"><a href=\"/opinion/201655/bocova-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir.2005). Generally, persecution is more than discrimination and rises above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering. <i>See </i><i>Sharari v. Gonzáles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201584\"><a href=\"/opinion/201584/sharari-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 475 (1st Cir.2005). We have held, however, that \"mistreatment can constitute persecution even though it does not embody a direct and unremitting threat to life or freedom.\" <i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 263.</p>\n<p>Sexual orientation can serve as the foundation for a claim of persecution, as it is the basis for inclusion in a particular social group. <i>See </i><i>Karouni v. Gonzáles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789444\"><a href=\"/opinion/789444/nasser-mustapha-karouni-v-alberto-gonzales-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1163</span></a></span>, 1172 (9th Cir.2005) (citing <i>Hernández-Montiel v.

Goldberg, <i>Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death: Political Asylum and the Global Persecution of Lesbians and Gay Men,</i> 26 Cornell Int'l L.J. 605, 609-12 (1993) (discussing homosexuals as a particular social group). Kadri listed his membership in a particular social group, in general, and his sexual orientation, in particular, as the basis for persecution in his asylum application. The IJ found him credible and determined that he is a homosexual; the BIA did not disturb this finding and acknowledged that sexual orientation is a basis for inclusion in a particular social group.</p>\n<p>Kadri arguesand the IJ foundthat he suffered economic persecution because he could not earn a living as a medical doctor. The BIA majority reversed the decision of the IJ. It noted that Kadri was never physically injured, arrested, or imprisoned, and concluded that \"the economic deprivations [Kadri] suffered as a result of his sexual orientation ... do not amount to persecution.\" Moreover, Kadri had not met his burden of showing a well-founded fear of future persecution. The dissenting panel member, however, would have remanded the case to the IJ to determine whether Kadri suffered past economic persecution. The dissenting member noted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> that \"it is not apparent that [the IJ] employed the correct standard\" for economic persecution, which the dissent described as being set forth in <i>Matter of Acosta,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985), <i>overruled on other grounds by </i><i>Matter of Mogharrabi,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 439 (BIA 1987), <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>Pitcherskaia v. I.N.S.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743552\"><a href=\"/opinion/743552/97-cal-daily-op-serv-4844-97-daily-journal-dar-7939-alla/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, 647-48 (9th Cir.1997). He also noted that it was not clear that we have endorsed the <i>Acosta</i> standard.</p>\n<p>Although the BIA dissent relied upon <i>Matter of Acosta</i> for its standard of economic persecution,<sup>[4]</sup> neither the BIA majority nor the IJ stated what standard was used to reject Kadri's economic persecution claim. The BIA and our sister circuits have not been consistent in articulating such a standard. Indeed, the Second Circuit in <i>Mirzoyan v. Gonzáles,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></span>, 222-23 (2d Cir.2006)(per curiam), remanded its case to the BIA to clarify the applicable standard, noting that the BIA has applied at least three different standards for economic persecution over the years. The BIA responded to this instruction in <i>In re T-Z-,</i> 24 I &amp; N. Dec. 163 (BIA 2007). Citing a prior case that had relied upon a 1978 House of Representatives Report, the BIA in <i>In re T-Z-</i> articulated the following standard for economic persecution: \"[Nonphysical] harm or suffering... <i>such as the deliberate imposition of severe economic disadvantage or the deprivation of liberty, food, housing, employment, or other essentials of life</i>\" may rise to persecution. <i>Id.</i> at 171 (emphasis in original)(quoting H.R.Rep. No. 95-1452, <i>as reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4700, 4704, <i>available at</i> 1978 WL 8575).</p>\n<p>In light of the intervening decision in <i>In re T-Z-,</i> and because we are unable to determine what standard the agency used in rejecting Kadri's economic persecution claim, we remand the case to the BIA to instruct the IJ to evaluate Kadri's case under the <i>In re T-Z-</i> standard. <i>See </i><i>Manzur v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1426658\"><a href=\"/opinion/1426658/manzur-v-us-dept-of-homeland-sec/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span>, 295 (2d Cir.2007). Based on his testimony and the evidence he submitted, Kadri may be able to sustain a claim for economic persecution. However, that is not the issue before us. Nor do we need to address the merits of whether the BIA's new standard, under <i>In re T-Z-,</i> survives <i>Chevron</i> review.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, we <i>grant</i> Kadri's petition for review, and the case is <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The BIA's order of removal is <i>vacated.</i></p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The dissenting panel member concluded that \"it is not apparent that [the IJ] employed the correct standard\" for economic persecution and would have remanded on that basis; he expressed no view on Kadri's claim of future persecution.</p>\n<p>[2]  The National Lawyers Guild, the Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders, and the National Immigrant Project submitted an amicus brief in support of Kadri.</p>\n<p>[3]  Kadri argues that the BIA did not apply the appropriate standard under this regulation; however, we need not decide this issue because we remand on other grounds.</p>\n<p>[4]  In <i>Matter of Acosta,</i> the petitioner argued that he was eligible for asylum because he claimed to have been deprived of his ability to earn a living. <i>See</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 217. Though the BIA dismissed the petition, it noted that \"persecution ... could consist of economic deprivation or restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to an individual's life or freedom.\" <i>Id.</i> at 222.</p>\n<p>[5]  Kadri maintains that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution in Indonesia on account of his sexual orientation. Because we remand on other grounds, we do not reach the issue of whether Kadri has a well-founded fear of future persecution at this time.</p>\n\n</div>",
