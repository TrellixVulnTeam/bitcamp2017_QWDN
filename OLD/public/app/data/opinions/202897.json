Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n       Torruella, Lynch, Lipez, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n                         ORDER OF COURT\n                    Entered: August 17, 2007\n\n     Appellee Kenneth Jonesâ€™ petition for rehearing en banc is\ndenied.\n\n                  Concurring statements follow.\n\f          BOUDIN, Chief Judge and LYNCH, Circuit Judge, concurring\n\nin the denial of rehearing en banc.       Properly, the revised panel\n\nopinion withdraws its ruling that the appellant waived or forfeited\n\nhis right to a ruling on his conditional new trial motion by\n\nfailing to renew or argue it after the district judge granted\n\nqualified immunity.     The panel opinion adheres to its decision\n\noverturning   the   district   judge's   belated   grant   of   qualified\n\nimmunity; at a minimum, we are both doubtful as to the panel\n\nmajority's reasoning and result on this issue.\n\n          Nevertheless,    at this time a new trial, in which all\n\nissues can be assessed afresh, appears to us the best solution--\n\ntaking account of the unfortunate uncertainty about just what the\n\njury decided and the other demands on the en banc court.          If the\n\ndistrict court grants the motion for a new trial and sets aside the\n\njury verdict, appellant will have an adequate opportunity to defend\n\nhimself on a fresh record and with proper instructions.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f          Torruella,   Circuit   Judge,   and   LIPEZ,    Circuit   Judge,\n\nconcurring in the denial of rehearing en banc.           The majority and\n\ndissenting opinions speak for themselves.        Whether or not there\n\nshould be a new trial on remand, and what issues should or should\n\nnot be addressed in any new trial, are entirely matters for the\n\ndistrict court to decide in the first instance.\n\n\n\n                            By the Court:\n                            Richard Cushing Donovan, Clerk.\n\n\n                            ___/s/__________________________\n                            By: Margaret Carter, Chief Deputy Clerk\n\n\n\n\n[Certified copies to Hon.
