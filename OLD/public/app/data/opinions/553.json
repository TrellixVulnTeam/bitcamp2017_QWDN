HALL,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                               v.\n\n                          JOHN CURRAN,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n         [Hon. Joseph N. LaPlante,    U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Boudin, Selya and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Kevin D. Hall on brief pro se.\n\n\n\n                         March 24, 2010\n\f             Per Curiam.      Federal courts are courts of limited\n\njurisdiction.       A cause of action may be maintained in federal\n\ncourt only if it involves a question of federal law, or if the\n\ncontroversy is between citizens of different states and the\n\namount in controversy exceeds $75,000.             28 U.S.C. §§ 1331,\n\n1332. This pro se prisoner's appeal raises the question of how\n\ncitizenship    of    an   incarcerated    person   is   determined   for\n\ndiversity jurisdiction purposes under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1).\n\nWe adopt the prevailing test articulated in Smith v. Cummings,\n\n445 F.3d 1254 (10th Cir. 2006), and affirm the district court's\n\ndismissal of appellant's complaint for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction.\n\n             Appellant Kevin D. Hall lived in New Hampshire prior\n\nto his incarceration.       After he was transferred to Sing Sing\n\npenitentiary in New York State, Hall filed suit in federal\n\ndistrict court against an attorney for the New Hampshire\n\nDepartment of Corrections (\"DOC\").          Hall's complaint alleged\n\nthat this attorney had reneged on a promise in an earlier\n\nlitigation     (initiated    when    Hall   was    imprisoned   in   New\n\nHampshire) to provide Hall with copies of his medical records\n\nin exchange for executing the forms that released those records\n\nto the attorney.\n\n             Hall's complaint alleged only state-law claims for\n\nfraud, breach of contract, and tortious interference with\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fbeneficial contractual relations, and sought damages of $10\n\nmillion.     The DOC attorney was the sole defendant; he worked\n\nand resided in New Hampshire and, for all intents and purposes,\n\nwas a citizen of that state.       No federal question having been\n\nalleged,   jurisdiction     therefore     depended     on   diversity   of\n\ncitizenship and an amount in controversy in excess of $75,000.\n\n28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1332.\n\n             After completing his initial review under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1915A and New Hampshire Local Rule 4.3(d)(2), the magistrate\n\njudge recommended that the complaint be dismissed for lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction because the controversy alleged was\n\nnot between citizens of different states. Hall timely objected\n\nand claimed that he would submit proof of his New York State\n\ncitizenship.        Besides his unsupported statement that he had\n\n\"agreed to a civil commitment placement\" in New York State\n\nafter his release from custody, Hall offered no evidence.               The\n\ndistrict court, on de novo review, dismissed the complaint.\n\n      Under     generally    accepted     principles,    citizenship    is\n\ndetermined     by     domicile,   which     can   be    established     by\n\ndemonstrating that the individual is physically present in the\n\nstate and has an intent to remain indefinitely.             Garcia Perez\n\nv. Santaella, 364 F.3d 348, 350 (1st Cir. 2004); Rodriguez-Diaz\n\nv. Sierra-Martinez, 853 F.2d 1027, 1029 (1st Cir. 1988).                 In\n\nordinary circumstances, all that is needed to change one's\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fdomicile is physical presence in the new state and the intent\n\nto make that state one's home.      E.g., Rodriguez-Diaz, 853 F.2d\n\nat 1029.\n\n             Domicile is determined at the time the suit is filed.\n\nGarcia Perez, 346 F.3d at 350-51.         \"Once challenged, the party\n\ninvoking   diversity    jurisdiction      must   prove   domicile      by   a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.\"         Id. at 350 (citing Bank One,\n\nTex., N.A. v. Montle, 964 F.2d 48, 50 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\n             In cases involving prisoners, the courts presume that\n\nthe prisoner remains a citizen of the state where he was\n\ndomiciled before his incarceration, even if he is subsequently\n\nincarcerated in a different state.          Smith, 445 F.3d at 1260\n\n(citing Sullivan v. Freeman, 944 F.2d 334, 337 (9th Cir.\n\n1991)).    That presumption is rebuttable, however.             Stifel v.\n\nHopkins, 477 F.2d 1116, 1126-27 (6th Cir. 1973) (\"a litigant\n\nwill not be precluded from establishing a domicile within a\n\nstate for purposes of diversity jurisdiction solely because his\n\npresence there initially resulted from circumstances beyond his\n\ncontrol\").    In order to overcome the presumption, the prisoner\n\nmust offer more than conclusory statements and unsupported\n\nallegations.      \"No   single   factor    is    dispositive,    and    the\n\nanalysis focuses not simply on the number of contacts with the\n\npurported domicile, but also on their substantive nature.\"\n\nGarcia Perez, 364 F.3d at 351 (citing Lundquist v. Precision\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fValley Aviation, Inc., 946 F.2d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 1991), and Leon\n\nv. Caribbean Hosp. Corp., 848 F. Supp. 317, 318 (D.P.R. 1994)\n\n(favoring ties that \"could not be easily undone\" over more\n\neasily established ties)).        Relevant factors for the district\n\ncourt   to   consider   include     \"the    prisoner's   declaration   of\n\nintentions, 'the possibility of parole ..., the manner in which\n\n[he] has ordered his personal and business affairs, and any\n\nother factors that are relevant to corroboration of [the\n\nprisoner's] statements.'\"         Smith, 445 F.3d at 1260 (quoting\n\nStifel, 477 F.2d at 1126-27).             See also Valedon Martinez v.\n\nHosp. Presbiteriano de la Comunidad, Inc., 806 F.2d 1128, 1132\n\n(1st Cir. 1986) (\"All that is required is that the court afford\n\nthe nonmoving party an ample opportunity to secure and present\n\nevidence     relevant    to   the    existence      of   jurisdiction.\")\n\n(citations and quotations marks omitted).\n\n             In this matter, the district court gave Hall ample\n\nopportunity to present evidence to establish his citizenship in\n\nNew York State.    Although Hall promised to submit proof of his\n\nnew domicile, he failed to do so.          Because Hall failed to rebut\n\nthe presumption that he is a citizen of New Hampshire, his\n\ndomicile prior to his incarceration, there was no diversity of\n\ncitizenship between the parties.           The district court properly\n\ndismissed     Hall's    complaint    for     lack   of   subject   matter\n\njurisdiction.\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -6-\n\f",
