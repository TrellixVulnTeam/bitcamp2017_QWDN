Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f             LYNCH, Chief Judge.          In March 2009, Vidalina Soto filed\n\nthis employment discrimination suit in federal court, alleging\n\nviolations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.\n\nยง 12101 et seq., and Puerto Rico law.               Soto named as defendants\n\nState Industrial Products Corp. and State Chemical Sales Company\n\nInternational,       Inc.    (together     \"State   Chemical\"),      which    have\n\nemployed Soto since 1992, their insurance companies, and associated\n\nindividuals.         State    Chemical     moved    to    dismiss    and    compel\n\narbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), 9\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1 et seq., on the grounds that the dispute was covered by\n\nan arbitration agreement.\n\n             Soto    argued     that     the   arbitration        agreement    was\n\nunenforceable due to a lack of consideration and consent.                      The\n\ndistrict     court   rejected    these    arguments      and    dismissed   Soto's\n\ncomplaint without prejudice on March 24, 2010. Soto v. State Chem.\n\nSales Co. Int'l, 719 F. Supp. 2d 189 (D.P.R. 2010).                 Soto filed a\n\ntimely appeal.\n\n             We affirm the judgment of the district court.             We reject\n\nSoto's claims that she did not receive valid consideration for\n\nsigning the arbitration agreement, that her consent was rendered\n\nvoid by the conditions under which she signed the agreement, and\n\nthat   the     arbitral       costs    imposed      by    the     agreement    are\n\nunconscionable.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f                                I.\n\n          We begin by describing the four documents that State\n\nChemical submitted to the district court with its motion to dismiss\n\nand compel arbitration.1\n\n          The first document, titled \"Acknowledgment,\" states:\n\n          I have received and read the alternative\n          dispute resolution program of State Industrial\n          Products (\"ADR Program\").\n\n          I understand that it is a three-step program\n          consisting of:\n                 1.   Internal negotiation;\n                 2.   Mediation    conducted    by    an\n                 independent, neutral third party; and\n                 3.   Arbitration before an independent,\n                 neutral third party.\n\n          I understand that if, I am employed    by State\n          Industrial Products prior to January   1, 1996,\n          I will retain all my rights to go to   court if\n          I so desire at the conclusion of       the ADR\n          program.\n\nSoto signed and dated this document on June 15, 1996.\n\n          The second document, titled \"Acknowledgment of Attendance\n\nand Receipt,\" states:\n\n\n\n     1\n          State Chemical's initial motion to dismiss for lack of\njurisdiction did not ask the district court to compel arbitration,\nbut its reply memo clarified that it sought such relief.        The\ndistrict court's Opinion and Order stated that it granted relief\ncompelling arbitration, but the court's Judgment did not. Soto\npresents no arguments as to these anomalies. In any event, we may\ntreat a motion to dismiss based on an arbitration clause as a\nrequest to compel arbitration when the facts of the case make it\nclear that the party intended to invoke arbitration.

Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp., 374 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\nCir. 2004).\n\n                               -3-\n\f          I acknowledge that on June 15, 1996, I\n          attended a meeting in which State Industrial\n          Product's Dispute Resolution Program was\n          described.   I also acknowledge that on this\n          date I received a copy of the State Industrial\n          Products Dispute Resolution Program.\n\nSoto signed and dated this document on June 15, 1996.\n\n          The third document, titled \"Sales Associate's Employment\n\nAgreement,\" is a written employment contract.    It states in two\n\nplaces that Soto's employment is on an \"at-will\" basis.        The\n\ncontract recites that it is supported by consideration in the form\n\nof \"the terms and conditions and the mutual covenants herein set\n\nforth and such other good and valuable consideration, the receipt\n\nof which is hereby acknowledged.\"\n\n          The contract contains an arbitration clause, which is not\n\nlisted in either the \"Company Obligations and Covenants\" section or\n\nthe \"Associate Obligations and Covenants\" section, but rather is\n\nlisted in an independent section, titled \"Alternative Dispute\n\nResolution,\" that states a mutual obligation:\n\n          I understand that the Company has a three-step\n          Alternative Dispute Resolution Program for its\n          employees consisting of 1. negotiation, 2.\n          mediation,   and    3.   final   and   binding\n          arbitration.      In   consideration  for   my\n          employment or continued employment by the\n          Company, I agree that this will be my\n          exclusive means of making any employment-\n          related claim against the Company, as set\n          forth in more detail in the State Industrial\n          Products Dispute Resolution Program, a copy of\n          which I have been provided.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fSoto signed this contract on March 1, 2001.                       It bears Soto's\n\ninitials on every page, and includes a separately initialed clause\n\nin bold stating: \"I HAVE READ AND I FULLY UNDERSTAND EACH AND EVERY\n\nPROVISION OF THE FOREGOING AND DO HEREBY ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THE\n\nSAME.\"      The    contract    is    also        initialed   and    signed     by     a\n\nrepresentative from human resources.\n\n           The fourth document is a copy of the ADR Program that is\n\nreferenced in the documents that Soto signed. This document states\n\nthat the program has an effective date of January 1, 1996, and that\n\n\"[c]ontinued      employment    by   the     Company      after    this    date     is\n\nconsideration for and constitutes acceptance of this alternative\n\ndispute resolution program.\"\n\n           The Program sets out a three-step process.                     The first\n\nstep is negotiation.         If the parties do not reach a settlement\n\nwithin 30 working days, they proceed to mediation before the\n\nAmerican Arbitration Association.           If the claim remains unresolved\n\nafter    mediation,    the     parties      go     to   arbitration    under        the\n\narbitration clause:\n\n           If the Employment Claim remains unresolved\n           following MEDIATION, the Complainant agrees to\n           promptly submit the Employment Claim to\n           ARBITRATION administered by the American\n           Arbitration Association in Cleveland, Ohio\n           under its Employment Dispute Resolution Rules.\n           . . . The Company agrees to pay one-half of\n           the filing fee and the Complainant agrees to\n           pay one-half of the filing fee to the American\n           Arbitration Association (current filing fee is\n           $500.00).    The Company agrees to pay the\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f          arbitrator's fee over and above the filing fee\n          (approximately $750.00/day).\n\nOther relevant provisions of this clause are as follows:\n\n          1. Procedure\n          The ARBITRATION shall take place in a location\n          to be determined by the Company, and the\n          Company shall pay reasonable out-of-pocket\n          travel expenses if any are incurred by the\n          Complainant as a result of the Company's\n          choice of location. . . .\n\n          2. Remedies\n          The arbitrator shall have the authority to\n          award whatever remedies would have been\n          available to the employee through a federal\n          court or the courts of the state in which the\n          hearing is held and which he/she determines to\n          be supported by credible, relevant evidence.\n\n          Employees who were employed before the effective date of\n\nJanuary 1, 1996 do \"not waive their right to go into court if they\n\nare dissatisfied at the conclusion of the three step program,\"\n\nwhile those employed after that date waive \"the right to take such\n\ndisputes to court.\"   This aspect of the agreement is explained in\n\na section titled \"Effect of Findings,\" which states:\n\n          If an individual was employed prior to January\n          1, 1996, the arbitrator's decision shall be\n          final and binding only if both parties so\n          stipulate. If the parties do stipulate that\n          the decision is final and binding, it may be\n          entered in any court having jurisdiction\n          thereof.   If the decision is not mutually\n          stipulated to be final and binding, and a\n          court proceeding is instituted, the decision\n          shall be admissible in that proceeding.\n\n          If a person is employed on or after January 1,\n          1996, the arbitrator's decision shall be final\n          and binding, and may be entered in any court\n          having jurisdiction thereof.\n\n                                -6-\n\f            Although it is only employees who are initially bound to\n\nsubmit their claims under this Program, the obligations imposed by\n\nthe Program are mutual.         When an employee submits a complaint,\n\nState Chemical must comply with the three-phase procedure outlined\n\nabove,   which    includes    the   possibility   of   a   binding   arbitral\n\ndecision.\n\n            The only carve-outs are contained in the clause titled\n\n\"What Disputes Are Covered By This Program,\" which states that the\n\nfollowing claims are not covered: \"Worker's compensation claims;\n\nUnemployment compensation claims; and Claims by the company for\n\ninjunctive relief and/or damages including but not limited to\n\nunfair competition, trade secrets, or confidential information\n\nclaims.\"\n\n            The Program expressly preserves the right of an employee\n\nto take a complaint to \"the appropriate Human Rights Commission,\n\nthe   [Equal     Employment   Opportunity    Commission]     or   any   other\n\ngovernment regulatory body.\"\n\n                                      II.\n\n            Because there is no dispute as to the authenticity of the\n\ndocuments submitted by State Chemical, and \"abstract questions as\n\nto whether particular disputes do (or do not) come within the four\n\ncorners of an expressly limited arbitration provision are legal in\n\nnature,\" we review the district court's judgment de novo.

Kirschhofer, 226 F.3d 15, 18-19\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).2\n\n          \"The   FAA   reflects   the   fundamental   principle   that\n\narbitration is a matter of contract.\"      Dialysis Access Ctr., LLC\n\nv. RMS Lifeline, Inc., No. 10-1872, 2011 WL 1139144, at *4 (1st\n\nCir. Mar. 30, 2011) (quoting RentโAโCenter, West, Inc. v. Jackson,\n\n130 S. Ct. 2772, 2776 (2010)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nEmployers and employees may contractually agree to submit federal\n\nclaims, including claims under the ADA, to arbitration. Bercovitch\n\nv. Baldwin Sch., Inc., 133 F.3d 141, 149-51 (1st Cir. 1998); see\n\nalso Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp, 500 U.S. 20, 35 (1991)\n\n(holding that age discrimination claim was subject to compulsory\n\narbitration); Rosenberg v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith,\n\nInc., 170 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1999) (holding that Title VII claim\n\nwas subject to compulsory arbitration).\n\n\n     2\n          Soto argues that the district court improperly relied on\nthe arbitration agreement documents, which were outside the scope\nof her complaint, without treating State Chemical's motion as a\nRule 56 motion for summary judgment. However, State Chemical's\nmotion was not based on Rule 12(b)(6) or Rule 12(c), which might\nhave triggered this requirement, but rather was made pursuant to\nthe FAA, 9 U.S.C. ยง 4. Also, although Soto claims she put material\nfacts into dispute, \"a party cannot avoid compelled arbitration by\ngenerally denying the facts upon which the right to arbitration\nrests; the party must identify specific evidence in the record\ndemonstrating a material factual dispute for trial.\" Tinder v.\nPinkerton Sec., 305 F.3d 728, 735 (7th Cir. 2002). Soto's only\nevidence, her unsworn declaration, did not raise a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact. Cf. id. at 736 (holding that employee's affidavit\nthat she never saw arbitration program documents did not raise\ntriable issue of fact as to existence of agreement to arbitrate\nthat would preclude compelled arbitration).\n\n                                  -8-\n\f              \"A party seeking to compel arbitration under the FAA must\n\ndemonstrate 'that a valid agreement to arbitrate exists, that the\n\nmovant is entitled to invoke the arbitration clause, that the other\n\nparty is bound by that clause, and that the claim asserted comes\n\nwithin   the    clause's      scope.'\"        Dialysis       Access    Ctr.,      2011   WL\n\n1139144, at *4 (quoting InterGen N.V. v. Grina, 344 F.3d 134, 142\n\n(1st   Cir.    2003)).        This   case      turns    on    the     first      of   these\n\nrequirements--the validity of the agreement.\n\n              The   contract     law     of    Puerto       Rico    \"control[s]          the\n\ndetermination of whether a valid agreement to arbitrate exists.\"\n\nCampbell v. Gen. Dynamics Gov't Sys. Corp., 407 F.3d 546, 552 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).      Under Puerto Rico law, there are three elements to a\n\nvalid contract: \"(1) The consent of the contracting parties. (2) A\n\ndefinite object which may be the subject of the contract. (3) The\n\ncause for the obligation which may be established.\" P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 31, ยง 3391.         \"Consent given by error, under violence, by\n\nintimidation, or deceit shall be void.\"                      Id. ยง 3404; see also\n\nDialysis      Access   Ctr.,     2011     WL    1139144,       at     *7    (discussing\n\nrequirements of consent).\n\n              The   central    question        in   this     case     is   whether       the\n\narbitration     agreement      signed    by     Soto   is     invalid      for    lack   of\n\nconsideration (what the quoted statute refers to as \"cause for the\n\nobligation\") or consent.             Soto claims that she did not receive\n\nadequate consideration for entering into the agreement, and that\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fthe district court's conclusion otherwise is (1) inconsistent with\n\nestablished Puerto Rico law on consideration for noncompetition\n\nagreements, and (2) inconsistent with Puerto Rico Law 80, P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. tit. 29, ยง 185a et seq. (\"Law 80\").          Soto claims that her\n\nconsent to the arbitration agreement is void because (1) she signed\n\nthe documents under threat of losing her continued employment, and\n\n(2) she is not fluent in English and did not \"fully understand\" the\n\ncontent of the documents that she signed.              We address these\n\narguments in turn.\n\nA.          Consideration\n\n            1.     Continued Employment\n\n            The parties have not cited to us any cases by Puerto Rico\n\ncourts deciding whether continued employment--which is expressly\n\ninvoked by the arbitration agreement as consideration for signing\n\nit--is valid consideration under Puerto Rico law.           Soto advances\n\ntwo arguments as to why it is not.\n\n            Her first argument is based on an analogy to Puerto Rico\n\nlaw on noncompetition covenants and the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Arthur Young & Co. v. Vega III, 136 D.P.R. 157, 1994\n\nP.R.-Eng. 909,262 (1994).      That decision, by now Chief Justice\n\nHernรกndez    Denton,   specified   the    conditions   of   validity   for\n\nnoncompetition covenants that place restrictions on an employee's\n\npost-employment work.    Addressing the issue of consideration, the\n\ncourt stated:\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f             [T]he employer shall offer a consideration in\n             exchange   for   the  employee   signing  the\n             noncompetition covenant.   This consideration\n             could consist, for example, of a promotion,\n             additional   employment   benefits,   or  the\n             enjoyment of substantial changes of a similar\n             nature in the employment conditions. Adequate\n             consideration could even be that a candidate\n             gets the position he wished for in the\n             company. Mere job tenure, however, will not\n             be admitted as a consideration of the\n             noncompetition agreement.\n\nId.       Soto   relies   on   this   statement   to   argue    that   continued\n\nemployment is inadequate consideration for signing an arbitration\n\nagreement.3      We reject this argument for two reasons.\n\n             First, Arthur Young does not opine on the consideration\n\nneeded to support an agreement to arbitrate employment disputes,\n\nand   its    statement     about      the   consideration      required   for   a\n\nnoncompetition agreement was part of a broader set of requirements\n\nthat do not apply to other contract clauses.4                    Likewise, the\n\n\n      3\n          The Arthur Young decision did not specify what was meant\nby \"job tenure\" or elaborate on this point, as it held that Vega's\npromotion was valid consideration for the noncompetition covenant.\n      4\n          For example, the court held that an employer can only\nimpose a noncompetition agreement if its absence would \"seriously\naffect[]\" the employer's interests, and that the existence of such\ninterests \"depend[s] on whether the employee's position in the\ncompany enables him to effectively compete with his employer in the\nfuture.\"   Arthur Young & Co. v. Vega III, 136 D.P.R. 157, 1994\nP.R.-Eng. 909,262 (1994). The court also held that \"the scope of\nthe prohibition must fit the employer's interest, insofar as\nobject, time, and place of the restriction or clients involved is\nconcerned.\"     Id.

As the Supreme Court has\n\nexplained, arbitration agreements may not be invalidated \"under\n\nstate   laws   applicable   only   to   arbitration   provisions.   .     .    .\n\nCongress precluded States from singling out arbitration provisions\n\nfor suspect status, requiring instead that such provisions be\n\nplaced 'upon the same footing as other contracts.'\"                Doctor's\n\nAssocs., Inc. v.

We   bypass   her   waiver,   to   evaluate    her\n\nargument and its underlying premise that Law 80 creates a right to\n\ncontinued employment.\n\n           In Puerto Rico, there are specialized statutes that\n\ncreate a right to continued employment in certain contexts.            See,\n\ne.g., P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 21, ยง 4560 (\"Every regular career\n\nemployee recruited according to the provisions of this subtitle,\n\nwho meets the criteria of productivity, efficiency, order and\n\ndiscipline . . . , shall be entitled to permanent employment\n\nstatus.\").   But Soto is mistaken in characterizing Law 80 as one of\n\nthem.\n\n           Law 80, a statute of general application, applies to\n\n\"[e]very employee in commerce, industry, or any other business or\n\nwork place . . . , contracted without a fixed term, who is\n\ndischarged from his/her employment without just cause.\"        P.R.

Under Law 80, these employees are entitled\n\nto a form of severance pay known as a \"mesada,\" which is calculated\n\nusing a formula based on the employee's salary and years of\n\nservice.5    See Otero-Burgos v. Inter Am.

E.

For\n\nat-will employees, it is hard to see why.\n\n          In exchange for Soto's agreement to arbitrate, State\n\nChemical did not invoke its right to terminate her employment--a\n\nright that it could have exercised, even without cause, subject to\n\nLaw 80 remedies.     The continued employment of Soto by State\n\nChemical under the new arrangement, which was not obligatory on the\n\npart of State Chemical, was sufficient consideration to render the\n\nagreement enforceable.

See Ramirez-Lebron v.

Consent\n\n          We also agree with the district court that the agreement\n\nis not unenforceable for lack of consent.   Under Puerto Rico law,\n\n\"[c]onsent given by error, under violence, by intimidation, or\n\ndeceit shall be void.\"   P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, ยง 3404.\n\n          Soto stated in an unsworn declaration that she was told\n\nthat she would be fired if she did not sign the \"Acknowledgment,\"\n\n\"Acknowledgment of Attendance and Receipt,\" and \"Sales Associate\n\nEmployment Agreement;\" that she is not fluent in English and did\n\nnot fully understand the documents; that she requested and was\n\ndenied the opportunity to meet with a lawyer before signing them;\n\nand that she was not provided with copies or translations of the\n\n\n                               -19-\n\fdocuments, even though she requested them.7      Soto also stated that\n\nshe never attended any meeting in which the ADR Program was\n\ndiscussed, and that the first time she saw the program document was\n\nin State Chemical's motion to dismiss.          On the basis of this\n\ndeclaration, Soto advances two arguments as to why her consent to\n\nthe agreement is void.\n\n           Soto first argues that her consent to the agreement was\n\ninduced by threat of job loss, and that this threat constituted\n\nintimidation that rendered her consent void.            State Chemical\n\nacknowledges that signing the arbitration agreement was a condition\n\nof   continued   employment.   The   only   question   is   whether   this\n\nconstitutes intimidation as a matter of law.\n\n           As defined under Puerto Rico law, \"[i]ntimidation exists\n\nwhen one of the contracting parties is inspired with a reasonable\n\nand well-grounded fear of suffering an imminent and serious injury\n\nto his person or property, or to the person or property of the\n\nspouse, descendants, or ascendants.\"        Id. ยง 3406.     Because Soto\n\ndoes not claim that State Chemical made any threat of injury to her\n\n\n      7\n          This declaration was roughly made pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\nยง 1746, which states: \"Wherever . . . any matter is required or\npermitted to be supported, evidenced, established, or proved by the\nsworn declaration, verification, certificate, statement, oath, or\naffidavit, in writing of the person making the same (other than a\ndeposition, or an oath of office, or an oath required to be taken\nbefore a specified official other than a notary public), such\nmatter may, with like force and effect, be supported, evidenced,\nestablished, or proved by the unsworn declaration, certificate,\nverification, or statement, in writing of such person which is\nsubscribed by him, as true under penalty of perjury . . . .\" Id.\n\n                                -20-\n\fperson, and she has made no showing that she had a property\n\ninterest in her at-will employment, she can make no viable claim\n\nthat she was intimidated under the meaning of Puerto Rico law.          Cf.\n\nStereo Gema, Inc. v. Magnadyne Corp., 941 F. Supp. 271, 276 (D.P.R.\n\n1996) (finding that consent was not rendered void by the fact that\n\nparty did not speak English or understand the contract, which was\n\nwritten in English; that he declared that he would not have signed\n\nagreement if he had been aware of the disputed clause; and that he\n\nwas told that if he did not sign the agreement, he would lose the\n\ncontract).\n\n           Soto's next argument is that Law 80 makes it illegal for\n\nState Chemical to threaten to fire her for refusing to sign the\n\nagreement.    She argues that because refusal to sign does not\n\nconstitute \"just cause\" for dismissal under the law, it was illegal\n\nfor State Chemical to make her continued employment conditional on\n\nher signing of the agreement.      But as we have already explained,\n\nLaw 80 does not make it illegal for State Chemical to fire Soto\n\nwithout just cause.    As such, an arbitration agreement is not made\n\nunenforceable by Law 80 merely because signing it was a condition\n\nof continued employment.      Cf. Rosenberg, 170 F.3d at 17 (holding\n\nthat   although   signing   arbitration   agreement   was   condition    of\n\nemployment, agreement was not void for unconscionability).\n\n           Soto's final argument is that her consent was void\n\nbecause she is not fluent in English and did not \"fully\" understand\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\fthe contents of the documents that she signed.   This amounts to an\n\nargument that she consented in error under P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,\n\nยง 3404.   However, an error can only invalidate consent if it is\n\nexcusable, which it is not \"when the ignorance of the true state of\n\nthings is due to negligence or fault of the one who invokes it.\"\n\nCitibank Global Markets, Inc. v.

In\n\n1996, Soto signed two documents acknowledging that she had been\n\ngiven a copy of the ADR Program document, that she understood it,\n\nand that she agreed to it.      And in 2001, she again signed a\n\ncontract agreeing to the terms of the Program.     She now alleges\n\nthat she never received a copy of the Program.

We\n\nbypass, in part, her waiver and reject this claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\f           Soto   argues   that    the    agreement    imposes     excessive\n\narbitration fees that will have the effect of preventing her from\n\nmaking any claims against State Chemical.          There is nothing in the\n\nrecord that supports this argument.        The filing fee that Soto paid\n\nto file this federal court action in 2009 was $350.           By contrast,\n\nthe Program states that if a claim proceeds to arbitration, the\n\nemployee \"agrees to pay one-half of the filing fee to the American\n\nArbitration Association (current filing fee is $500.00).\"                 And\n\nunder the current AAA rules for disputes arising out of employer-\n\npromulgated plans, the fees would be even less: \"In cases before a\n\nsingle arbitrator, a nonrefundable filing fee capped in the amount\n\nof $175 is payable in full by the employee when a claim is filed,\n\nunless   the   plan   provides    that    the    employee   pay   less.    A\n\nnonrefundable fee in the amount of $925 is payable in full by the\n\nemployer, unless the plan provides that the employer pay more.\"\n\n           The arbitration scheme does not require Soto to pay for\n\nthe time spent by the decision maker.           The Program clearly states\n\nthat the \"Company agrees to pay the arbitrator's fee over and above\n\nthe filing fee (approximately $750.00/day).\" Soto claims that this\n\nlanguage is ambiguous and may be read as requiring that she pay the\n\narbitrator's daily fee up to an amount equal to the filing fee.           We\n\nare not persuaded by this reading of the clause, and in any event,\n\nState Chemical is bound by its representations to this court that\n\nSoto would pay no more than one-half of the AAA filing fee.\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\f          Soto also argues that State Chemical could choose to have\n\nthe arbitration located in Cleveland, Ohio, which would also impose\n\nprohibitive costs and prevent her from making a claim. Although it\n\nis true that the Program states that the arbitration \"shall take\n\nplace in a location to be determined by the Company,\" it also\n\nstates that \"the Company shall pay reasonable out-of-pocket travel\n\nexpenses if any are incurred by the Complainant as a result of the\n\nCompany's choice of location.\" Further, State Chemical is bound by\n\nits representation to this court at oral argument that Puerto Rican\n\nemployment disputes would be arbitrated in Puerto Rico, and that if\n\nthe arbitration occurred outside of Puerto Rico, State Chemical\n\nwould pay not only Soto's reasonable expenses, but also those of\n\nany witnesses that she needed to bring from Puerto Rico.\n\n          Soto presents other arguments to us on appeal that were\n\nnot presented to the district court.   They are waived.\n\n                               III.\n\n          We affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                               -25-\n\f",

Soto named as defendants State Industrial Products Corp. and State Chemical Sales Company International, Inc. (together \"State Chemical\"), which have employed Soto since 1992, their insurance companies, and associated individuals. State Chemical moved to dismiss and compel arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), 9 U.S.C. ยง 1 <i>et seq.,</i> on the grounds that the dispute was covered by an arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>Soto argued that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable due to a lack of consideration and consent. The district court rejected these arguments and dismissed Soto's complaint without prejudice on March 24, 2010. <i>Soto v. State Chem. Sales Co. Int'l,</i> 719 F.Supp.2d 189 (D.P.R. 2010). Soto filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p>We affirm the judgment of the district court. We reject Soto's claims that she did not receive valid consideration for signing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> the arbitration agreement, that her consent was rendered void by the conditions under which she signed the agreement, and that the arbitral costs imposed by the agreement are unconscionable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We begin by describing the four documents that State Chemical submitted to the district court with its motion to dismiss and compel arbitration.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The first document, titled \"Acknowledgment,\" states:</p>\n<blockquote>I have received and read the alternative dispute resolution program of State Industrial Products (\"ADR Program\").</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I understand that it is a three-step program consisting of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1. Internal negotiation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. Mediation conducted by an independent, neutral third party; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. Arbitration before an independent, neutral third party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I understand that if, I am employed by State Industrial Products prior to January 1, 1996, I will retain all my rights to go to court if I so desire at the conclusion of the ADR program.</blockquote>\n<p>Soto signed and dated this document on June 15, 1996.</p>\n<p>The second document, titled \"Acknowledgment of Attendance and Receipt,\" states:</p>\n<blockquote>I acknowledge that on June 15, 1996, I attended a meeting in which State Industrial Product's Dispute Resolution Program was described. I also acknowledge that on this date I received a copy of the State Industrial Products Dispute Resolution Program.</blockquote>\n<p>Soto signed and dated this document on June 15, 1996.</p>\n<p>The third document, titled \"Sales Associate's Employment Agreement,\" is a written employment contract. It states in two places that Soto's employment is on an \"at-will\" basis. The contract recites that it is supported by consideration in the form of \"the terms and conditions and the mutual covenants herein set forth and such other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged.\"</p>\n<p>The contract contains an arbitration clause, which is not listed in either the \"Company Obligations and Covenants\" section or the \"Associate Obligations and Covenants\" section, but rather is listed in an independent section, titled \"Alternative Dispute Resolution,\" that states a mutual obligation:</p>\n<blockquote>I understand that the Company has a three-step Alternative Dispute Resolution Program for its employees consisting of 1. negotiation, 2. mediation, and 3. final and binding arbitration. In consideration for my employment or continued employment by the Company, I agree that this will be my exclusive means of making any employment-related claim against the Company, as set forth in more detail in the State Industrial Products Dispute Resolution Program, a copy of which I have been provided.</blockquote>\n<p>Soto signed this contract on March 1, 2001. It bears Soto's initials on every page, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> includes a separately initialed clause in bold stating: \"I HAVE READ AND I FULLY UNDERSTAND EACH AND EVERY PROVISION OF THE FOREGOING AND DO HEREBY ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THE SAME.\" The contract is also initialed and signed by a representative from human resources.</p>\n<p>The fourth document is a copy of the ADR Program that is referenced in the documents that Soto signed. This document states that the program has an effective date of January 1, 1996, and that \"[c]ontinued employment by the Company after this date is consideration for and constitutes acceptance of this alternative dispute resolution program.\"</p>\n<p>The Program sets out a three-step process. The first step is negotiation. If the parties do not reach a settlement within 30 working days, they proceed to mediation before the American Arbitration Association. If the claim remains unresolved after mediation, the parties go to arbitration under the arbitration clause:</p>\n<blockquote>If the Employment Claim remains unresolved following MEDIATION, the Complainant agrees to promptly submit the Employment Claim to ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration Association in Cleveland, Ohio under its Employment Dispute Resolution Rules. . . . The Company agrees to pay one-half of the filing fee and the <i>Complainant agrees to pay one-half of the filing fee to the American Arbitration Association</i> (current filing fee is $500.00). The Company agrees to pay the arbitrator's fee over and above the filing fee (approximately $750.00/day).</blockquote>\n<p>Other relevant provisions of this clause are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>1. Procedure</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The ARBITRATION shall take place in a location to be determined by the Company, and the Company shall pay reasonable out-of-pocket travel expenses if any are incurred by the Complainant as a result of the Company's choice of location.. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. Remedies</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The arbitrator shall have the authority to award whatever remedies would have been available to the employee through a federal court or the courts of the state in which the hearing is held and which he/she determines to be supported by credible, relevant evidence.</blockquote>\n<p>Employees who were employed before the effective date of January 1, 1996 do \"not waive their right to go into court if they are dissatisfied at the conclusion of the three step program,\" while those employed after that date waive \"the right to take such disputes to court.\" This aspect of the agreement is explained in a section titled \"Effect of Findings,\" which states:</p>\n<blockquote>If an individual was employed prior to January 1, 1996, the arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding only if both parties so stipulate. If the parties do stipulate that the decision is final and binding, it may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. If the decision is not mutually stipulated to be final and binding, and a court proceeding is instituted, the decision shall be admissible in that proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If a person is employed on or after January 1, 1996, the arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</blockquote>\n<p>Although it is only employees who are initially bound to submit their claims under this Program, the obligations imposed by the Program are mutual. When an employee submits a complaint, State Chemical must comply with the three-phase procedure outlined above, which includes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> the possibility of a binding arbitral decision.</p>\n<p>The only carve-outs are contained in the clause titled \"What Disputes Are Covered By This Program,\" which states that the following claims are not covered: \"Worker's compensation claims; Unemployment compensation claims; and Claims by the company for injunctive relief and/or damages including but not limited to unfair competition, trade secrets, or confidential information claims.\"</p>\n<p>The Program expressly preserves the right of an employee to take a complaint to \"the appropriate Human Rights Commission, the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] or any other government regulatory body.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Because there is no dispute as to the authenticity of the documents submitted by State Chemical, and \"abstract questions as to whether particular disputes do (or do not) come within the four corners of an expressly limited arbitration provision are legal in nature,\" we review the district court's judgment de novo. <i>Paul Revere Variable Annuity Ins. Co. v. Kirschhofer,</i> 226 F.3d 15, 18-19 (1st Cir.2000).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>\"The FAA reflects the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract.\" <i>Dialysis Access Ctr., LLC v. RMS Lifeline, Inc.,</i> 638 F.3d 367, 376 (1st Cir.2011) (quoting <i>Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2772, 2776, 177 L.Ed.2d 403 (2010)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Employers and employees may contractually agree to submit federal claims, including claims under the ADA, to arbitration. <i>Bercovitch v. Baldwin Sch., Inc.,</i> 133 F.3d 141, 149-51 (1st Cir.1998); <i>see also </i><i>Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.,</i> 500 U.S. 20, 35, 111 S.Ct. 1647, 114 L.Ed.2d 26 (1991) (holding that age discrimination claim was subject to compulsory arbitration); <i>Rosenberg v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc.,</i> 170 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1999) (holding that Title VII claim was subject to compulsory arbitration).</p>\n<p>\"A party seeking to compel arbitration under the FAA must demonstrate `that a valid agreement to arbitrate exists, that the movant is entitled to invoke the arbitration clause, that the other party is bound by that clause, and that the claim asserted comes within the clause's scope.'\" <i>Dialysis Access Ctr.,</i> 638 F.3d at 375 (quoting <i>InterGen N.V. v. Grina,</i> 344 F.3d 134, 142 (1st Cir.2003)). This case turns on the first of these requirementsยthe validity of the agreement.</p>\n<p>The contract law of Puerto Rico \"control[s] the determination of whether a valid agreement to arbitrate exists.\" <i>Campbell v. Gen. Dynamics Gov't Sys. Corp.,</i> 407 F.3d 546, 552 (1st Cir.2005). Under Puerto <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> to Rico law, there are three elements to a valid contract: \"(1) The consent of the contracting parties. (2) A definite object which may be the subject of the contract. (3) The cause for the obligation which may be established.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, ยง 3391. \"Consent given by error, under violence, by intimidation, or deceit shall be void.\" <i>Id.</i> ยง 3404; <i>see also </i><i>Dialysis Access Ctr.,</i> 638 F.3d at 378-79 (discussing requirements of consent).</p>\n<p>The central question in this case is whether the arbitration agreement signed by Soto is invalid for lack of consideration (what the quoted statute refers to as \"cause for the obligation\") or consent. Soto claims that she did not receive adequate consideration for entering into the agreement, and that the district court's conclusion otherwise is (1) inconsistent with established Puerto Rico law on consideration for noncompetition agreements, and (2) inconsistent with Puerto Rico Law 80, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, ยง 185a <i>et seq.</i> (\"Law 80\"). Soto claims that her consent to the arbitration agreement is void because (1) she signed the documents under threat of losing her continued employment, and (2) she is not fluent in English and did not \"fully understand\" the content of the documents that she signed. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Consideration</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Continued Employment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The parties have not cited to us any cases by Puerto Rico courts deciding whether continued employmentยwhich is expressly invoked by the arbitration agreement as consideration for signing itยis valid consideration under Puerto Rico law. Soto advances two arguments as to why it is not.</p>\n<p>Her first argument is based on an analogy to Puerto Rico law on noncompetition covenants and the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision in <i>Arthur Young &amp; Co. v. Vega III,</i> 136 D.P.R. 157, 1994 P.R.-Eng. 909,262 (1994). That decision, by now Chief Justice Hernรกndez Denton, specified the conditions of validity for noncompetition covenants that place restrictions on an employee's post-employment work. Addressing the issue of consideration, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he employer shall offer a consideration in exchange for the employee signing the noncompetition covenant. This consideration could consist, for example, of a promotion, additional employment benefits, or the enjoyment of substantial changes of a similar nature in the employment conditions. Adequate consideration could even be that a candidate gets the position he wished for in the company. Mere job tenure, however, will not be admitted as a consideration of the noncompetition agreement.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> Soto relies on this statement to argue that continued employment is inadequate consideration for signing an arbitration agreement.<sup>[3]</sup> We reject this argument for two reasons.</p>\n<p>First, <i>Arthur Young</i> does not opine on the consideration needed to support an agreement to arbitrate employment disputes, and its statement about the consideration required for a noncompetition agreement was part of a broader set of requirements that do not apply to other contract clauses.<sup>[4]</sup> Likewise, the motivations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> for these restrictions, which have been recognized by many jurisdictions, <i>see generally</i> Ferdinand S. Tinio, Annotation, <i>Sufficiency of Consideration for Employee's Covenant Not to Compete, Entered into After Inception of Employment,</i> 51 A.L.R.3d 825, ยง 4(a) (2010) (listing cases), are not necessarily applicable to arbitration agreements, <i>see </i><i>Pine River State Bank v. Mettille,</i> 333 N.W.2d 622, 630 n. 5 (Minn.1983) (stating that the requirements of consideration for noncompetition clauses are different than those for other contract clauses).</p>\n<p>Second, while Puerto Rico may impose special restrictions on noncompetition agreements, it is preempted from imposing special restrictions on arbitration agreements. As the Supreme Court has explained, arbitration agreements may not be invalidated \"under state laws applicable <i>only</i> to arbitration provisions. . . . Congress precluded States from singling out arbitration provisions for suspect status, requiring instead that such provisions be placed `upon the same footing as other contracts.'\" <i>Doctor's Assocs., Inc. v. Casarotto,</i> 517 U.S. 681, 687, 116 S.Ct. 1652, 134 L.Ed.2d 902 (1996) (quoting <i>Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co.,</i> 417 U.S. 506, 511, 94 S.Ct. 2449, 41 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974)) (citations omitted); <i>see also </i><i>KKW Enters., Inc. v. Gloria Jean's Gourmet Coffees,</i> 184 F.3d 42, 50-52 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we reject Soto's invitation to expand the scope of <i>Arthur Young</i> to hold that continued employment cannot constitute valid consideration for an arbitration agreement. <i>Cf. </i><i>Cherena v. Coors Brewing Co.,</i> 20 F.Supp.2d 282 (D.P.R.1998) (holding that although a non-competition clause failed to satisfy Puerto Rico's requirements of consideration under <i>Arthur Young,</i> a severable non-disclosure clause was enforceable); <i>see also Jimenez v. Island Oasis Frozen Cocktail Co., Inc.,</i> No. 09-1748, 2010 WL 3719216 (D.P.R. Sept. 14, 2010) (same).</p>\n<p>Soto's second argument, which she raises for the first time on appeal, is that the requirements imposed on employers by Law 80 precludes a finding that continued employment can constitute valid consideration. We bypass her waiver, to evaluate her argument and its underlying premise that Law 80 creates a right to continued employment.</p>\n<p>In Puerto Rico, there are specialized statutes that create a right to continued employment in certain contexts. <i>See, e.g.,</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 21, ยง 4560 (\"Every regular career employee recruited according to the provisions of this subtitle, who meets the criteria of productivity, efficiency, order and discipline . . ., shall be entitled to permanent employment status.\"). But Soto is mistaken in characterizing Law 80 as one of them.</p>\n<p>Law 80, a statute of general application, applies to \"[e]very employee in commerce, industry, or any other business or work place . . ., contracted without a fixed term, who is discharged from his/her employment without just cause.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, ยง 185a. Under Law 80, these employees are entitled to a form of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> severance pay known as a \"mesada,\" which is calculated using a formula based on the employee's salary and years of service.<sup>[5]</sup><i>See </i><i>Otero-Burgos v. Inter Am. Univ.,</i> 558 F.3d 1, 7-9 (1st Cir.2009) (providing overview of content and purpose of Law 80).</p>\n<p>Any claim that Law 80 does more than create a right to severance pay for covered employees is foreclosed by our precedent. <i>See </i><i>Rodriguez v. E. Air Lines, Inc.,</i> 816 F.2d 24 (1st Cir.1987) (rejecting district court's holding that Law 80 imposed a duty on employers to retain employees with greater seniority when lay-offs became necessary, <i>id.</i> at 25, 28, and holding that \"severance pay is the only remedy available under Law 80,\" <i>id.</i> at 29).</p>\n<p>Soto concedes that new employment is valid consideration for the execution of an arbitration agreement, <i>see </i><i>Hadnot v. Bay, Ltd.,</i> 344 F.3d 474, 477 (5th Cir.2003) (holding that offer of at-will employment is valid consideration to support an arbitration agreement), but argues that continued employment is different. For at-will employees, it is hard to see why.</p>\n<p>In exchange for Soto's agreement to arbitrate, State Chemical did not invoke its right to terminate her employmentยa right that it could have exercised, even without cause, subject to Law 80 remedies. The continued employment of Soto by State Chemical under the new arrangement, which was not obligatory on the part of State Chemical, was sufficient consideration to render the agreement enforceable. <i>Accord </i><i>Tinder v. Pinkerton Sec.,</i> 305 F.3d 728, 734-35 (7th Cir.2002) (Wis.law); <i>Pomposi v. GameStop, Inc.,</i> No. 3:09-cv-340, 2010 WL 147196, at *6 (D.Conn. Jan. 11, 2010) (Conn.law); <i>Baumann v.

United HealthCare Corp.,</i> 338 S.C. 29, 524 S.E.2d 839, 845 n. 4 (App.1999) (S.C.law).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The fact that State Chemical stated that Soto's continued employment was conditional on her signing of the agreement dispels any possible doubt over whether the consideration received was real. <i>Cf. </i><i>Gibson v. Neighborhood Health Clinics, Inc.,</i> 121 F.3d 1126, 1132 (7th Cir.1997) (finding that continued employment did not constitute consideration for arbitration agreement when employer had neither promised to continue employment nor stated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> that employee's status would be uncertain if she did not sign); <i>Advanced Copy Prods., Inc. v. Cool,</i> 173 Ind.App. 363, 363 N.E.2d 1070, 1071 (1977) (finding that because there was no evidence that an employee's continued employment was dependent upon his signing a noncompetition agreement, continued employment did not constitute consideration to support the covenant).</p>\n<p>Absent specific support from the case law of Puerto Rico, we reject Soto's argument that her continued employment did not constitute valid consideration for her signing of the arbitration agreement. But as we explain below, even if Soto were correct on this point, the arbitration agreement would still be enforceable, as it was supported by independent valid consideration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Bilateral Obligation to Arbitrate</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Soto also received, in exchange for her promise to adhere to and be bound by the terms of an ADR Plan that included arbitration, State Chemical's promise to do the same.</p>\n<p>\"Puerto Rican law provides that `a bilateral obligation assumed by each one of the parties to the contract, has, as its consideration, the promise offered in exchange.' Both parties must be bound based on `mutual consideration' that yields either a benefit or a detriment to each party.\" <i>Adria Int'l Grp., Inc. v. Ferre Dev., Inc.,</i> 241 F.3d 103, 107 (1st Cir.2001) (citations omitted) (quoting <i>United States v. Perez,</i> 528 F.Supp. 206, 209 (D.P.R. 1981)). Although the parties have not cited to us any cases by Puerto Rico courts applying this basic principle of contract law to agreements to arbitrate, other courts applying the principle have held that the equal obligation of an employee and employer to arbitrate disputes falling in the coverage of an ADR plan \"is enough to ensure mutuality of obligation and thus constitute consideration.\" <i>Seawright v. Am. Gen. Fin. Servs.,</i> 507 F.3d 967, 974 (6th Cir.2007) (Tenn.law); <i>accord </i><i>Blair v. Scott Specialty Gases,</i> 283 F.3d 595, 603-04 (3rd Cir.2002) (Pa.law); <i>Michalski v. Circuit City Stores, Inc.,</i> 177 F.3d 634, 637 (7th Cir.1999) (Wis.law); <i>Koveleskie v. SBC Capital Markets, Inc.,</i> 167 F.3d 361, 368 (7th Cir.1999) (Ill.law); <i>O'Neil v. Hilton Head Hosp.,</i> 115 F.3d 272, 274-75 (4th Cir.1997) (S.C.law).</p>\n<p>In the case before us, the arbitration clause is supported by this type of mutual consideration. Soto was employed prior to January 1, 1996, so an arbitral decision will be \"final and binding\" and entered in court \"only if both parties so stipulate.\" Because both Soto and State Chemical promise only to forgo a judicial forum in the first instance, and to be bound by the result only if they so stipulate, their promises to arbitrate constitute valid mutual consideration. <i>See </i><i>Ramirez-Lebron v. Int'l Shipping Agency, Inc.,</i> 593 F.3d 124, 132 n. 4 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>The fact that it is the complainant who must submit to arbitrate claims unresolved by mediation does not make the consideration provided by State Chemical illusory. Most jurisdictions do not require that both parties to a contract have identical remedies to satisfy the general requirement of mutuality of obligation, <i>see, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Contracts</i> ยง 363 cmt. c (1981); 25 Richard A. Lord, <i>Williston on Contracts</i> ยง 67:40 (4th ed.2010), and we are aware of nothing in Puerto Rico statutory or case law that requires otherwise, <i>see, e.g.,</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, ยง 3391. Further, as we noted earlier, the FAA preempts Puerto Rico from imposing such a requirement applicable only to arbitration provisions. <i>Casarotto,</i> 517 U.S. at 687, 116 S.Ct. 1652; <i>Southeastern Stud &amp; Components, Inc. v. Am.

Under Puerto Rico law, \"[c]onsent given by error, under violence, by intimidation, or deceit shall be void.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, ยง 3404.</p>\n<p>Soto stated in an unsworn declaration that she was told that she would be fired if she did not sign the \"Acknowledgment,\" \"Acknowledgment of Attendance and Receipt,\" and \"Sales Associate Employment Agreement;\" that she is not fluent in English and did not fully understand the documents; that she requested and was denied the opportunity to meet with a lawyer before signing them; and that she was not provided with copies or translations of the documents, even though she requested them.<sup>[7]</sup> Soto also stated that she never attended any meeting in which the ADR Program was discussed, and that the first time she saw the program document was in State Chemical's motion to dismiss. On the basis of this declaration, Soto advances two arguments as to why her consent to the agreement is void.</p>\n<p>Soto first argues that her consent to the agreement was induced by threat of job loss, and that this threat constituted intimidation that rendered her consent void. State Chemical acknowledges that signing the arbitration agreement was a condition of continued employment. The only question is whether this constitutes intimidation as a matter of law.</p>\n<p>As defined under Puerto Rico law, \"[i]ntimidation exists when one of the contracting parties is inspired with a reasonable and well-grounded fear of suffering an imminent and serious injury to his person or property, or to the person or property of the spouse, descendants, or ascendants.\" <i>Id.</i> ยง 3406. Because Soto does not claim that State Chemical made any threat of injury to her person, and she has made no showing that she had a property interest in her at-will employment, she can make no viable claim that she was intimidated under the meaning of Puerto Rico law. <i>Cf. </i><i>Stereo Gema, Inc. v. Magnadyne Corp.,</i> 941 F.Supp. 271, 276 (D.P.R.1996) (finding that consent was not rendered void by the fact that party did not speak English or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> understand the contract, which was written in English; that he declared that he would not have signed agreement if he had been aware of the disputed clause; and that he was told that if he did not sign the agreement, he would lose the contract).</p>\n<p>Soto's next argument is that Law 80 makes it illegal for State Chemical to threaten to fire her for refusing to sign the agreement. She argues that because refusal to sign does not constitute \"just cause\" for dismissal under the law, it was illegal for State Chemical to make her continued employment conditional on her signing of the agreement. But as we have already explained, Law 80 does not make it illegal for State Chemical to fire Soto without just cause. As such, an arbitration agreement is not made unenforceable by Law 80 merely because signing it was a condition of continued employment. <i>Cf. </i><i>Rosenberg,</i> 170 F.3d at 17 (holding that although signing arbitration agreement was condition of employment, agreement was not void for unconscionability).</p>\n<p>Soto's final argument is that her consent was void because she is not fluent in English and did not \"fully\" understand the contents of the documents that she signed. This amounts to an argument that she consented in error under P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, ยง 3404. However, an error can only invalidate consent if it is excusable, which it is not \"when the ignorance of the true state of things is due to negligence or fault of the one who invokes it.\" <i>Citibank Global Markets, Inc. v. Rodriguez Santana,</i> 573 F.3d 17, 24 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting <i>Capo Caballero v. Ramos,</i> 83 D.P.R. 650 (1961)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Here, the facts alleged by Soto make it clear that any error in her understanding of the contract is not excusable. In 1996, Soto signed two documents acknowledging that she had been given a copy of the ADR Program document, that she understood it, and that she agreed to it. And in 2001, she again signed a contract agreeing to the terms of the Program. She now alleges that she never received a copy of the Program. Under Puerto Rico law, \"the onus was on her\" to obtain and read a copy before signing it. <i>Rodriguez-Bird v. Santander Sec. Corp.,</i> No. 09-2238, 2010 WL 2541708, at *2 (D.P.R. June 17, 2010).</p>\n<p>Further, it is a general and well established principle of contract law that \"one who is ignorant of the language in which a document is written, or who is illiterate,\" may be bound to a contract by negligently failing to learn its contents. 1 Richard A. Lord, <i>Williston on Contracts</i> ยง 4:19 (4th ed.2010) (footnote omitted); <i>see also </i><i>N.Y. Life Ins. Co. v. Kwetkauskas,</i> 63 F.2d 890, 891 (3d Cir.1933) (recognizing principle); <i>Stern v. Moneyweight Scale Co.,</i> 42 App.D.C. 162, 165 (D.C.Cir.1914) (same); <i>Chicago, St. P., M. &amp; O. Ry. Co. v. Belliwith,</i> 83 F. 437, 439-40 (8th Cir.1897) (same). \"In the absence of fraud, the fact that an offeree cannot read, write, speak, or understand the English language is immaterial to whether an English-language agreement the offeree executes is enforceable.\" <i>Morales v. Sun Constructors, Inc.,</i> 541 F.3d 218, 222 (3d Cir.2008); <i>see also id.</i> 222-23 (listing cases).</p>\n<p>The fact that Soto did not \"fully\" understand the agreements that she signed because of her lack of fluency in English, of which she was aware, does not render void her consent to arbitrate. <i>Cf. </i><i>Herman v. Hogar Praderas de Amor, Inc.,</i> 130 F.Supp.2d 257, 262-63 (D.P.R.2001) (rejecting challenge to the validity of a waiver even though the document was written in English, which the signing party did not understand, and the other party did not explain its contents in the meeting at which it was signed); <i>see also </i><i>Sanchez-Santiago</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> <i>v. Guess, Inc.,</i> 512 F.Supp.2d 75, 79-80 (D.P.R.2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Unconscionability</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Soto makes an argument to this court on appeal, which was not made to the district court, that the terms of the arbitration agreement are so unreasonable that they should not be enforced. We bypass, in part, her waiver and reject this claim.</p>\n<p>Soto argues that the agreement imposes excessive arbitration fees that will have the effect of preventing her from making any claims against State Chemical. There is nothing in the record that supports this argument. The filing fee that Soto paid to file this federal court action in 2009 was $350. By contrast, the Program states that if a claim proceeds to arbitration, the employee \"agrees to pay one-half of the filing fee to the American Arbitration Association (current filing fee is $500.00).\" And under the current AAA rules for disputes arising out of employer-promulgated plans, the fees would be even less: \"In cases before a single arbitrator, a nonrefundable filing fee capped in the amount of $175 is payable in full by the employee when a claim is filed, unless the plan provides that the employee pay less. A nonrefundable fee in the amount of $925 is payable in full by the employer, unless the plan provides that the employer pay more.\"</p>\n<p>The arbitration scheme does not require Soto to pay for the time spent by the decision maker. The Program clearly states that the \"Company agrees to pay the arbitrator's fee over and above the filing fee (approximately $750.00/day).\" Soto claims that this language is ambiguous and may be read as requiring that she pay the arbitrator's daily fee up to an amount equal to the filing fee. We are not persuaded by this reading of the clause, and in any event, State Chemical is bound by its representations to this court that Soto would pay no more than one-half of the AAA filing fee.</p>\n<p>Soto also argues that State Chemical could choose to have the arbitration located in Cleveland, Ohio, which would also impose prohibitive costs and prevent her from making a claim. Although it is true that the Program states that the arbitration \"shall take place in a location to be determined by the Company,\" it also states that \"the Company shall pay reasonable out-of-pocket travel expenses if any are incurred by the Complainant as a result of the Company's choice of location.\" Further, State Chemical is bound by its representation to this court at oral argument that Puerto Rican employment disputes would be arbitrated in Puerto Rico, and that if the arbitration occurred outside of Puerto Rico, State Chemical would pay not only Soto's reasonable expenses, but also those of any witnesses that she needed to bring from Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>Soto presents other arguments to us on appeal that were not presented to the district court. They are waived.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  State Chemical's initial motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction did not ask the district court to compel arbitration, but its reply memo clarified that it sought such relief. The district court's Opinion and Order stated that it granted relief compelling arbitration, but the court's Judgment did not. Soto presents no arguments as to these anomalies. In any event, we may treat a motion to dismiss based on an arbitration clause as a request to compel arbitration when the facts of the case make it clear that the party intended to invoke arbitration. <i>See </i><i>IOM Corp. v. Brown Forman Corp.,</i> 627 F.3d 440, 449 n. 10 (1st Cir.2010); <i>Fit Tech, Inc. v. Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp.,</i> 374 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>[2]  Soto argues that the district court improperly relied on the arbitration agreement documents, which were outside the scope of her complaint, without treating State Chemical's motion as a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment. However, State Chemical's motion was not based on Rule 12(b)(6) or Rule 12(c), which might have triggered this requirement, but rather was made pursuant to the FAA, 9 U.S.C. ยง 4. Also, although Soto claims she put material facts into dispute, \"a party cannot avoid compelled arbitration by generally denying the facts upon which the right to arbitration rests; the party must identify specific evidence in the record demonstrating a material factual dispute for trial.\" <i>Tinder v. Pinkerton Sec.,</i> 305 F.3d 728, 735 (7th Cir.2002). Soto's only evidence, her unsworn declaration, did not raise a genuine issue of material fact. <i>Cf. id.</i> at 736 (holding that employee's affidavit that she never saw arbitration program documents did not raise triable issue of fact as to existence of agreement to arbitrate that would preclude compelled arbitration).</p>\n<p>[3]  The <i>Arthur Young</i> decision did not specify what was meant by \"job tenure\" or elaborate on this point, as it held that Vega's promotion was valid consideration for the noncompetition covenant.</p>\n<p>[4]  For example, the court held that an employer can only impose a noncompetition agreement if its absence would \"seriously affect[]\" the employer's interests, and that the existence of such interests \"depend[s] on whether the employee's position in the company enables him to effectively compete with his employer in the future.\" <i>Arthur Young &amp; Co. v. Vega III,</i> 136 D.P.R. 157, 1994 P.R.-Eng. 909,262 (1994). The court also held that \"the scope of the prohibition must fit the employer's interest, insofar as object, time, and place of the restriction or clients involved is concerned.\" <i>Id.</i> Specifically, the court held that the \"noncompetition term should not exceed twelve months\" and \"the contract must specify the geographic limits or the clients involved,\" which \"must be strictly limited to that necessary to prevent an actual competition between employer and employee.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[5]  The discharged employee is entitled to:\n</p>\n<p>(a) The salary corresponding to two (2) months, as indemnity, if discharged within the first five (5) years of service; the salary corresponding to three (3) months if discharged after five years (5) and up to fifteen (15) years of service; the salary corresponding to six (6) months if discharged after fifteen (15) years of service.</p>\n<p>(b) An additional progressive compensation equal to one (1) week for each year of service, if discharged within the first five (5) years of service; to two (2) weeks for each year of service, if discharged after five (5) years and up to fifteen (15) years of service; to three (3) weeks for each year of service if discharged after fifteen (15) years of service.</p>\n<p>P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, ยง 185a.</p>\n<p>[6]  We are not convinced by those cases that have held otherwise. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Morrow v. Hallmark Cards, Inc.,</i> 273 S.W.3d 15, 27-29 (Mo.App.2008); <i>Piano v. Premier Distrib. Co.,</i> 137 N.M. 57, 107 P.3d 11, 14-15 (App.2004); <i>J.M. Davidson, Inc. v.

State Chemical moved to dismiss and compel arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), 9 U.S.C. ยง 1 <i>et seq.,</i> on the grounds that the dispute was covered by an arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>Soto argued that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable due to a lack of consideration and consent. The district court rejected these arguments and dismissed Soto's complaint without prejudice on March 24, 2010. <i>Soto v. State Chem. Sales Co.

We reject Soto's claims that she did not receive valid consideration for signing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> the arbitration agreement, that her consent was rendered void by the conditions under which she signed the agreement, and that the arbitral costs imposed by the agreement are unconscionable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We begin by describing the four documents that State Chemical submitted to the district court with its motion to dismiss and compel arbitration.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The first document, titled \"Acknowledgment,\" states:</p>\n<blockquote>I have received and read the alternative dispute resolution program of State Industrial Products (\"ADR Program\").</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I understand that it is a three-step program consisting of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1. Internal negotiation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. Mediation conducted by an independent, neutral third party; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. Arbitration before an independent, neutral third party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I understand that if, I am employed by State Industrial Products prior to January 1, 1996, I will retain all my rights to go to court if I so desire at the conclusion of the ADR program.</blockquote>\n<p>Soto signed and dated this document on June 15, 1996.</p>\n<p>The second document, titled \"Acknowledgment of Attendance and Receipt,\" states:</p>\n<blockquote>I acknowledge that on June 15, 1996, I attended a meeting in which State Industrial Product's Dispute Resolution Program was described. I also acknowledge that on this date I received a copy of the State Industrial Products Dispute Resolution Program.</blockquote>\n<p>Soto signed and dated this document on June 15, 1996.</p>\n<p>The third document, titled \"Sales Associate's Employment Agreement,\" is a written employment contract. It states in two places that Soto's employment is on an \"at-will\" basis. The contract recites that it is supported by consideration in the form of \"the terms and conditions and the mutual covenants herein set forth and such other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged.\"</p>\n<p>The contract contains an arbitration clause, which is not listed in either the \"Company Obligations and Covenants\" section or the \"Associate Obligations and Covenants\" section, but rather is listed in an independent section, titled \"Alternative Dispute Resolution,\" that states a mutual obligation:</p>\n<blockquote>I understand that the Company has a three-step Alternative Dispute Resolution Program for its employees consisting of 1. negotiation, 2. mediation, and 3. final and binding arbitration. In consideration for my employment or continued employment by the Company, I agree that this will be my exclusive means of making any employment-related claim against the Company, as set forth in more detail in the State Industrial Products Dispute Resolution Program, a copy of which I have been provided.</blockquote>\n<p>Soto signed this contract on March 1, 2001. It bears Soto's initials on every page, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> includes a separately initialed clause in bold stating: \"I HAVE READ AND I FULLY UNDERSTAND EACH AND EVERY PROVISION OF THE FOREGOING AND DO HEREBY ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THE SAME.\" The contract is also initialed and signed by a representative from human resources.</p>\n<p>The fourth document is a copy of the ADR Program that is referenced in the documents that Soto signed. This document states that the program has an effective date of January 1, 1996, and that \"[c]ontinued employment by the Company after this date is consideration for and constitutes acceptance of this alternative dispute resolution program.\"</p>\n<p>The Program sets out a three-step process. The first step is negotiation. If the parties do not reach a settlement within 30 working days, they proceed to mediation before the American Arbitration Association. If the claim remains unresolved after mediation, the parties go to arbitration under the arbitration clause:</p>\n<blockquote>If the Employment Claim remains unresolved following MEDIATION, the Complainant agrees to promptly submit the Employment Claim to ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration Association in Cleveland, Ohio under its Employment Dispute Resolution Rules. . . . The Company agrees to pay one-half of the filing fee and the <i>Complainant agrees to pay one-half of the filing fee to the American Arbitration Association</i> (current filing fee is $500.00). The Company agrees to pay the arbitrator's fee over and above the filing fee (approximately $750.00/day).</blockquote>\n<p>Other relevant provisions of this clause are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>1. Procedure</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The ARBITRATION shall take place in a location to be determined by the Company, and the Company shall pay reasonable out-of-pocket travel expenses if any are incurred by the Complainant as a result of the Company's choice of location.. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. Remedies</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The arbitrator shall have the authority to award whatever remedies would have been available to the employee through a federal court or the courts of the state in which the hearing is held and which he/she determines to be supported by credible, relevant evidence.</blockquote>\n<p>Employees who were employed before the effective date of January 1, 1996 do \"not waive their right to go into court if they are dissatisfied at the conclusion of the three step program,\" while those employed after that date waive \"the right to take such disputes to court.\" This aspect of the agreement is explained in a section titled \"Effect of Findings,\" which states:</p>\n<blockquote>If an individual was employed prior to January 1, 1996, the arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding only if both parties so stipulate. If the parties do stipulate that the decision is final and binding, it may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. If the decision is not mutually stipulated to be final and binding, and a court proceeding is instituted, the decision shall be admissible in that proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If a person is employed on or after January 1, 1996, the arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</blockquote>\n<p>Although it is only employees who are initially bound to submit their claims under this Program, the obligations imposed by the Program are mutual. When an employee submits a complaint, State Chemical must comply with the three-phase procedure outlined above, which includes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> the possibility of a binding arbitral decision.</p>\n<p>The only carve-outs are contained in the clause titled \"What Disputes Are Covered By This Program,\" which states that the following claims are not covered: \"Worker's compensation claims; Unemployment compensation claims; and Claims by the company for injunctive relief and/or damages including but not limited to unfair competition, trade secrets, or confidential information claims.\"</p>\n<p>The Program expressly preserves the right of an employee to take a complaint to \"the appropriate Human Rights Commission, the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] or any other government regulatory body.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Because there is no dispute as to the authenticity of the documents submitted by State Chemical, and \"abstract questions as to whether particular disputes do (or do not) come within the four corners of an expressly limited arbitration provision are legal in nature,\" we review the district court's judgment de novo. <i>Paul Revere Variable Annuity Ins.

Laws Ann. tit. 31, ยง 3391. \"Consent given by error, under violence, by intimidation, or deceit shall be void.\" <i>Id.</i> ยง 3404; <i>see also </i><i>Dialysis Access Ctr.,</i> 638 F.3d at 378-79 (discussing requirements of consent).</p>\n<p>The central question in this case is whether the arbitration agreement signed by Soto is invalid for lack of consideration (what the quoted statute refers to as \"cause for the obligation\") or consent. Soto claims that she did not receive adequate consideration for entering into the agreement, and that the district court's conclusion otherwise is (1) inconsistent with established Puerto Rico law on consideration for noncompetition agreements, and (2) inconsistent with Puerto Rico Law 80, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, ยง 185a <i>et seq.</i> (\"Law 80\"). Soto claims that her consent to the arbitration agreement is void because (1) she signed the documents under threat of losing her continued employment, and (2) she is not fluent in English and did not \"fully understand\" the content of the documents that she signed. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Consideration</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Continued Employment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The parties have not cited to us any cases by Puerto Rico courts deciding whether continued employmentยwhich is expressly invoked by the arbitration agreement as consideration for signing itยis valid consideration under Puerto Rico law. Soto advances two arguments as to why it is not.</p>\n<p>Her first argument is based on an analogy to Puerto Rico law on noncompetition covenants and the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision in <i>Arthur Young &amp; Co. v. Vega III,</i> 136 D.P.R. 157, 1994 P.R.-Eng. 909,262 (1994). That decision, by now Chief Justice Hernรกndez Denton, specified the conditions of validity for noncompetition covenants that place restrictions on an employee's post-employment work. Addressing the issue of consideration, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he employer shall offer a consideration in exchange for the employee signing the noncompetition covenant. This consideration could consist, for example, of a promotion, additional employment benefits, or the enjoyment of substantial changes of a similar nature in the employment conditions. Adequate consideration could even be that a candidate gets the position he wished for in the company. Mere job tenure, however, will not be admitted as a consideration of the noncompetition agreement.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> Soto relies on this statement to argue that continued employment is inadequate consideration for signing an arbitration agreement.<sup>[3]</sup> We reject this argument for two reasons.</p>\n<p>First, <i>Arthur Young</i> does not opine on the consideration needed to support an agreement to arbitrate employment disputes, and its statement about the consideration required for a noncompetition agreement was part of a broader set of requirements that do not apply to other contract clauses.<sup>[4]</sup> Likewise, the motivations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> for these restrictions, which have been recognized by many jurisdictions, <i>see generally</i> Ferdinand S. Tinio, Annotation, <i>Sufficiency of Consideration for Employee's Covenant Not to Compete, Entered into After Inception of Employment,</i> 51 A.L.R.3d 825, ยง 4(a) (2010) (listing cases), are not necessarily applicable to arbitration agreements, <i>see </i><i>Pine River State Bank v.

As the Supreme Court has explained, arbitration agreements may not be invalidated \"under state laws applicable <i>only</i> to arbitration provisions. . . . Congress precluded States from singling out arbitration provisions for suspect status, requiring instead that such provisions be placed `upon the same footing as other contracts.'\" <i>Doctor's Assocs., Inc. v.

We bypass her waiver, to evaluate her argument and its underlying premise that Law 80 creates a right to continued employment.</p>\n<p>In Puerto Rico, there are specialized statutes that create a right to continued employment in certain contexts. <i>See, e.g.,</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 21, ยง 4560 (\"Every regular career employee recruited according to the provisions of this subtitle, who meets the criteria of productivity, efficiency, order and discipline . . ., shall be entitled to permanent employment status.\").

Laws Ann. tit. 29, ยง 185a. Under Law 80, these employees are entitled to a form of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> severance pay known as a \"mesada,\" which is calculated using a formula based on the employee's salary and years of service.<sup>[5]</sup><i>See </i><i>Otero-Burgos v.

Under Puerto Rico law, \"[c]onsent given by error, under violence, by intimidation, or deceit shall be void.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, ยง 3404.</p>\n<p>Soto stated in an unsworn declaration that she was told that she would be fired if she did not sign the \"Acknowledgment,\" \"Acknowledgment of Attendance and Receipt,\" and \"Sales Associate Employment Agreement;\" that she is not fluent in English and did not fully understand the documents; that she requested and was denied the opportunity to meet with a lawyer before signing them; and that she was not provided with copies or translations of the documents, even though she requested them.<sup>[7]</sup> Soto also stated that she never attended any meeting in which the ADR Program was discussed, and that the first time she saw the program document was in State Chemical's motion to dismiss. On the basis of this declaration, Soto advances two arguments as to why her consent to the agreement is void.</p>\n<p>Soto first argues that her consent to the agreement was induced by threat of job loss, and that this threat constituted intimidation that rendered her consent void. State Chemical acknowledges that signing the arbitration agreement was a condition of continued employment. The only question is whether this constitutes intimidation as a matter of law.</p>\n<p>As defined under Puerto Rico law, \"[i]ntimidation exists when one of the contracting parties is inspired with a reasonable and well-grounded fear of suffering an imminent and serious injury to his person or property, or to the person or property of the spouse, descendants, or ascendants.\" <i>Id.</i> ยง 3406. Because Soto does not claim that State Chemical made any threat of injury to her person, and she has made no showing that she had a property interest in her at-will employment, she can make no viable claim that she was intimidated under the meaning of Puerto Rico law. <i>Cf. </i><i>Stereo Gema, Inc. v.

She argues that because refusal to sign does not constitute \"just cause\" for dismissal under the law, it was illegal for State Chemical to make her continued employment conditional on her signing of the agreement. But as we have already explained, Law 80 does not make it illegal for State Chemical to fire Soto without just cause. As such, an arbitration agreement is not made unenforceable by Law 80 merely because signing it was a condition of continued employment. <i>Cf. </i><i>Rosenberg,</i> 170 F.3d at 17 (holding that although signing arbitration agreement was condition of employment, agreement was not void for unconscionability).</p>\n<p>Soto's final argument is that her consent was void because she is not fluent in English and did not \"fully\" understand the contents of the documents that she signed. This amounts to an argument that she consented in error under P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, ยง 3404. However, an error can only invalidate consent if it is excusable, which it is not \"when the ignorance of the true state of things is due to negligence or fault of the one who invokes it.\" <i>Citibank Global Markets, Inc. v.

Ramos,</i> 83 D.P.R. 650 (1961)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Here, the facts alleged by Soto make it clear that any error in her understanding of the contract is not excusable. In 1996, Soto signed two documents acknowledging that she had been given a copy of the ADR Program document, that she understood it, and that she agreed to it. And in 2001, she again signed a contract agreeing to the terms of the Program. She now alleges that she never received a copy of the Program. Under Puerto Rico law, \"the onus was on her\" to obtain and read a copy before signing it. <i>Rodriguez-Bird v. Santander Sec.

We bypass, in part, her waiver and reject this claim.</p>\n<p>Soto argues that the agreement imposes excessive arbitration fees that will have the effect of preventing her from making any claims against State Chemical. There is nothing in the record that supports this argument. The filing fee that Soto paid to file this federal court action in 2009 was $350. By contrast, the Program states that if a claim proceeds to arbitration, the employee \"agrees to pay one-half of the filing fee to the American Arbitration Association (current filing fee is $500.00).\" And under the current AAA rules for disputes arising out of employer-promulgated plans, the fees would be even less: \"In cases before a single arbitrator, a nonrefundable filing fee capped in the amount of $175 is payable in full by the employee when a claim is filed, unless the plan provides that the employee pay less. A nonrefundable fee in the amount of $925 is payable in full by the employer, unless the plan provides that the employer pay more.\"</p>\n<p>The arbitration scheme does not require Soto to pay for the time spent by the decision maker. The Program clearly states that the \"Company agrees to pay the arbitrator's fee over and above the filing fee (approximately $750.00/day).\" Soto claims that this language is ambiguous and may be read as requiring that she pay the arbitrator's daily fee up to an amount equal to the filing fee. We are not persuaded by this reading of the clause, and in any event, State Chemical is bound by its representations to this court that Soto would pay no more than one-half of the AAA filing fee.</p>\n<p>Soto also argues that State Chemical could choose to have the arbitration located in Cleveland, Ohio, which would also impose prohibitive costs and prevent her from making a claim. Although it is true that the Program states that the arbitration \"shall take place in a location to be determined by the Company,\" it also states that \"the Company shall pay reasonable out-of-pocket travel expenses if any are incurred by the Complainant as a result of the Company's choice of location.\" Further, State Chemical is bound by its representation to this court at oral argument that Puerto Rican employment disputes would be arbitrated in Puerto Rico, and that if the arbitration occurred outside of Puerto Rico, State Chemical would pay not only Soto's reasonable expenses, but also those of any witnesses that she needed to bring from Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>Soto presents other arguments to us on appeal that were not presented to the district court. They are waived.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  State Chemical's initial motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction did not ask the district court to compel arbitration, but its reply memo clarified that it sought such relief. The district court's Opinion and Order stated that it granted relief compelling arbitration, but the court's Judgment did not. Soto presents no arguments as to these anomalies. In any event, we may treat a motion to dismiss based on an arbitration clause as a request to compel arbitration when the facts of the case make it clear that the party intended to invoke arbitration. <i>See </i><i>IOM Corp. v. Brown Forman Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"180299\"><a href=\"/opinion/180299/iom-corp-v-brown-forman-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">627</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span>, 449 n. 10 (1st Cir.2010); <i>Fit Tech, Inc. v. Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201103\"><a href=\"/opinion/201103/fit-tech-inc-v-bally-total-fitness/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>[2]  Soto argues that the district court improperly relied on the arbitration agreement documents, which were outside the scope of her complaint, without treating State Chemical's motion as a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment. However, State Chemical's motion was not based on Rule 12(b)(6) or Rule 12(c), which might have triggered this requirement, but rather was made pursuant to the FAA, 9 U.S.C. ยง 4. Also, although Soto claims she put material facts into dispute, \"a party cannot avoid compelled arbitration by generally denying the facts upon which the right to arbitration rests; the party must identify specific evidence in the record demonstrating a material factual dispute for trial.\" <i>Tinder v. Pinkerton Sec.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779315\"><a href=\"/opinion/779315/ilah-m-tinder-v-pinkerton-security/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">728</span></a></span>, 735 (7th Cir.2002). Soto's only evidence, her unsworn declaration, did not raise a genuine issue of material fact. <i>Cf. id.</i> at 736 (holding that employee's affidavit that she never saw arbitration program documents did not raise triable issue of fact as to existence of agreement to arbitrate that would preclude compelled arbitration).</p>\n<p>[3]  The <i>Arthur Young</i> decision did not specify what was meant by \"job tenure\" or elaborate on this point, as it held that Vega's promotion was valid consideration for the noncompetition covenant.</p>\n<p>[4]  For example, the court held that an employer can only impose a noncompetition agreement if its absence would \"seriously affect[]\" the employer's interests, and that the existence of such interests \"depend[s] on whether the employee's position in the company enables him to effectively compete with his employer in the future.\" <i>Arthur Young &amp; Co. v. Vega III,</i> 136 D.P.R. 157, 1994 P.R.-Eng. 909,262 (1994). The court also held that \"the scope of the prohibition must fit the employer's interest, insofar as object, time, and place of the restriction or clients involved is concerned.\" <i>Id.</i> Specifically, the court held that the \"noncompetition term should not exceed twelve months\" and \"the contract must specify the geographic limits or the clients involved,\" which \"must be strictly limited to that necessary to prevent an actual competition between employer and employee.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[5]  The discharged employee is entitled to:\n</p>\n<p>(a) The salary corresponding to two (2) months, as indemnity, if discharged within the first five (5) years of service; the salary corresponding to three (3) months if discharged after five years (5) and up to fifteen (15) years of service; the salary corresponding to six (6) months if discharged after fifteen (15) years of service.</p>\n<p>(b) An additional progressive compensation equal to one (1) week for each year of service, if discharged within the first five (5) years of service; to two (2) weeks for each year of service, if discharged after five (5) years and up to fifteen (15) years of service; to three (3) weeks for each year of service if discharged after fifteen (15) years of service.</p>\n<p>P.R.
