Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                               Before\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                     Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Joshua L. Gordon for appellant.\n     Thomas M. Gannon, Attorney, United States Department of\nJustice, with whom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and\nKenneth P. Madden, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           July 17, 2003\n\f             CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.      Percio Reynoso appeals from\n\na judgment of conviction and sentence imposed under 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1) & 846. The evidence introduced at trial established that\n\nReynoso and Benjamin Valera conspired to distribute cocaine at\n\nValera’s store in Providence, Rhode Island, and were arrested there\n\non   March    29,   2001,   immediately   following   a   drug   sale    to   a\n\nconfidential informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration\n\n(DEA).       In due course Reynoso was indicted for conspiring to\n\ndistribute, and distributing, a controlled substance.                   See 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846.         Following trial, the jury returned\n\nguilty verdicts against Reynoso on each count, and the district\n\ncourt imposed a 109-month term of imprisonment.                  Reynoso now\n\nappeals.     We affirm.\n\nA.    The Speedy Trial Act\n\n             Reynoso first contends that he was brought to trial more\n\nthan seventy days after his indictment, in violation of the Speedy\n\nTrial Act (STA), 18 U.S.C. §§ 3161(c)(1), 3161(h), 3162(a)(2).\n\nConclusions of law under the STA are reviewed de novo; findings of\n\nfact for clear error only.      United States v. Scott, 270 F.3d 30, 55\n\n(1st Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 1007 (2002).         We discern no\n\nerror.\n\n             Although Reynoso asserts that seventy-one days were non-\n\nexcludable under the STA, the instant appeal must fail if any one\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fof the seventy-one days is determined excludable under the STA. We\n\nnow turn to that analysis.\n\n          On August 1, 2001, the STA clock was tolled upon the\n\nempanelment of the trial jury.           See United States v. Rodriguez, 63\n\nF.3d 1159, 1164 (1st Cir. 1995).              Prior to the time the jury was\n\nsworn, however, Valera entered into an agreement to cooperate with\n\nthe   government,     and   the       government      submitted    a   superseding\n\nindictment    which    added      a    conspiracy      count     against   Reynoso.\n\nThereafter, the district court dismissed the initial jury and\n\nscheduled a second jury empanelment for September 11, 2001.1                     Of\n\ncourse, the period from August 1 to August 15 — the date of the\n\nsuperseding indictment — is excludable, in that the August 1 jury\n\nempanelment   tolled    the    STA      and   there    is   no    record   evidence\n\nwhatsoever that the government sought the initial jury empanelment\n\nas a pretext for delaying the trial.               See id.2\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      Even assuming that the August delay was nonexcludable,\nReynoso has advanced no argument on appeal as to why at least one\nday of the eighteen-day delay in empaneling the second jury, which\noccurred after the unprecedented terrorist attacks of September 11,\n2001, would not have been fairly excludable under the STA’s “ends\nof justice” exclusion.     See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(A); United\nStates v. Barnes, 251 F.3d 251, 256 (1st Cir. 2001) (reviewing §\n3161(h)(8)(A) determinations for abuse of discretion only).\n      2\n      Absent any evidence of governmental misconduct, we likewise\nreject the claim that the trial delay violated Reynoso's due\nprocess rights. See, e.g., United States v. Stokes, 124 F.3d 39,\n47 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                        -3-\n\fB.   The Motion to Suppress\n\n          Reynoso next contends that his signed confession should\n\nhave been suppressed because the DEA agents (i) failed to accord\n\nhim Miranda     warnings,    either   in    Spanish   or   in   English,   (ii)\n\nthreatened him with deportation, (iii) declined his request to\n\nconsult counsel, and (iv) recruited Valera to cajole him into\n\nconfessing.     Findings of fact made in relation to a motion to\n\nsuppress are reviewed only for clear error.                United States v.\n\nRosario-Diaz, 202 F.3d 54, 68 (1st Cir. 2000).                  We discern no\n\nerror.\n\n          The     district    court   was    presented     with   conflicting\n\ntestimony regarding each of these occurrences.              Moreover, as the\n\nprimary arbiter of witness credibility, the district court acted\n\nwell within its prerogative in discrediting the version of the\n\nrelevant events posited by Reynoso.           See United States v. Laine,\n\n270 F.3d 71, 75 (1st Cir. 2001); see also United States v. Abou-\n\nSaada, 785 F.2d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 1986) (discerning no clear error in\n\nfinding that defendant had understood Miranda warnings, even though\n\ndefendant later was afforded a translator at trial).\n\nC.   The Expert Testimony\n\n          At the time of the arrest, the DEA agents seized 110\n\ngrams of cocaine from Reynoso's automobile, which was parked near\n\nValera’s store.    During trial, Reynoso maintained that so “small”\n\nan amount of cocaine plainly was intended exclusively for personal\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fuse,   rather      than    distribution.         Reynoso   now    challenges     the\n\nadmission into evidence of the expert testimony of DEA Agent\n\nKathleen Kelleher — that the quantity of cocaine seized from\n\nReynoso’s car was too large to have been exclusively for his\n\npersonal use — given that Agent Kelleher concededly had no personal\n\nexperience    with    cocaine    users,     as    distinguished      from    cocaine\n\ndistributors. We discern no abuse of discretion. United States v.\n\nDiaz, 300 F.3d 66, 74 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            Due to her DEA experience, Agent Kelleher was competent\n\nto testify to the relative raw-weight distinctions in the drug\n\nquantities typically possessed by users as distinguished from\n\ndealers.     See, e.g., United States v. Valle, 72 F.3d 210, 214-15\n\n(1st Cir. 1995); United States v. Muldrow, 19 F.3d 1332, 1338 (10th\n\nCir. 1994).       Furthermore, as Reynoso was charged with distributing\n\n500 or     more    grams   of   cocaine,    and    the   government's       evidence\n\nconnected him to the kilogram of cocaine seized at Valera’s store,\n\ninfra, the conviction would stand even absent evidence that Reynoso\n\nintended to distribute the 110 grams.              Consequently, any error in\n\nallowing    Kelleher’s       testimony     into    evidence      would   have   been\n\nharmless.     See Fed. R. Evid. 103(a).\n\nD.     The Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            Next, Reynoso contends that the government adduced no\n\ncreditable evidence that he supplied the kilogram of cocaine found\n\nin Valera’s store.         We review de novo all the evidence, as well as\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fall credibility determinations, in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict to determine whether a rational jury could have found the\n\ndefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.                  United States v.\n\nMorillo, 158 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n           Altogether    aside       from    Reynoso’s     confession,   Valera\n\nexplicitly testified that Reynoso supplied the kilogram of cocaine\n\nseized at the store. Plainly, the mere fact that Valera cooperated\n\nwith the government, in return for a more lenient sentence, did not\n\nrender his testimony unreliable, per se.            Moreover, the jury was\n\nfully apprised of the plea agreement Valera entered into with the\n\ngovernment.    See United States v. Hernandez, 109 F.3d 13, 15 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).    Although Reynoso points out that the DEA task force\n\ndid not see him deliver cocaine, notwithstanding its six-month\n\nsurveillance of the Valera store, Valera’s testimony was fully\n\ncreditable absent further corroboration, see id., and Reynoso\n\nplainly   —   and   prudently    —    may    have   made    these   deliveries\n\nsurreptitiously.\n\n           Similarly, Reynoso contends that there was insufficient\n\nevidence that he intended to distribute the 110 grams of cocaine\n\nseized from his car.    The jury heard the expert testimony given by\n\nAgent Kelleher, supra, as well as evidence that Reynoso supplied\n\nValera with other cocaine plainly intended for distribution.                In\n\ncontrast, Reynoso presented the implausible defense that he needed\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fto have as much as 110 grams on hand because his supplier was away\n\non a six-week vacation.\n\nE.   The Obstruction of Justice Enhancement\n\n           Reynoso      maintains    that     the    district    court       erred   in\n\nimposing a two-level “obstruction of justice” enhancement under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3C1.1, given that the government failed to establish\n\nthat he perjured himself in testifying that he received no Miranda\n\nwarnings   and   that    he   had    intended       the   110   grams   of    cocaine\n\nexclusively for his own use, whereas that testimony could have\n\nresulted   simply    from     poor   memory    or    the   shock   and    confusion\n\nincident    to    his     arrest.        Questions         of    law     concerning\n\ninterpretations of the Sentencing Guidelines are reviewed de novo,\n\nand the factual conclusions of the sentencing court, which must be\n\nsupported by a preponderance of the evidence, are reviewed for\n\nclear error.     United States v. Damon, 127 F.3d 139, 141 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n           Although false testimony caused by mistake, confusion or\n\npoor memory is not perjurious, see United States v.                 D’Andrea, 107\n\nF.3d 949, 958 (1st Cir. 1997), Miranda warnings were read to\n\nReynoso on two separate occasions following his arrest, both in\n\nEnglish and in Spanish.         Similarly, at best the contention that\n\nReynoso intended the 110 grams of cocaine exclusively for personal\n\nuse was implausible, directly contradicted by Agent Kelleher, and\n\ninconsistent with Reynoso's pretrial statement that he had never\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fused cocaine.     Moreover, the district court is the primary arbiter\n\nof witness credibility under U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1, see United States v.\n\nMcKeeve, 131 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 1997), and we discern no clear\n\nerror in its determination.\n\nF.     The Denial of the Motion to Depart Downward\n\n            Lastly, Reynoso maintains that the district court erred\n\nin denying a downward departure notwithstanding the fact that, as\n\na deportable alien, he would not have the benefit of various\n\nameliorative programs, such as a halfway house and a work release\n\nprogram,    which    would    be    available    to     comparable     non-alien\n\nprisoners; hence, his conditions of imprisonment would be rendered\n\nmore   severe.       Absent   any   evidence     that    the    district     court\n\nerroneously believed that it lacked the discretionary power to\n\ndepart downward in these alleged factual circumstances, see United\n\nStates v. Farouil, 124 F.3d 838, 847 (7th Cir. 1997) (noting that\n\ndeparture might be warranted in cases where “[defendant’s] status\n\nas a deportable alien has resulted in unusual or exceptional\n\nhardship in his conditions of confinement”) (emphasis added), we\n\nhave no jurisdiction to review its decision not to depart.                    See\n\nUnited States v. Lujan, 324 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 2003); see also\n\nUnited   States     v.   Sachdev,   279   F.3d   25,    28     (1st   Cir.   2002)\n\n(“Defendant bears the burden of proof by the preponderance of the\n\nevidence of showing eligibility for a Guidelines departure.”).\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f",

Prior to the time the jury was sworn, however, Valera entered into an agreement to cooperate with the government, and the government submitted a superseding indictment which added a conspiracy count against Reynoso. Thereafter, the district court dismissed the initial jury and scheduled a second jury empanelment for September 11, 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Of course, the period from August 1 to August 15 &#8212; the date of the superseding indictment &#8212; is excludable, in that the August 1 jury empanelment tolled the STA and there is no record evidence whatsoever that the government sought the initial jury empanelment as a pretext for delaying the trial. <i>See id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Motion to Suppress</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reynoso next contends that his signed confession should have been suppressed because the DEA agents (i) failed to accord him <i>Miranda</i> warnings, either in Spanish or in English, (ii) threatened him with deportation, (iii) declined his request to consult counsel, and (iv) recruited Valera to cajole him into confessing.

The evidence introduced at trial established that Reynoso and Benjamin Valera conspired to distribute cocaine at Valera's store in Providence, Rhode Island, and were arrested there on March 29, 2001, immediately following a drug sale to a confidential informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). In due course Reynoso was indicted for conspiring to distribute, and distributing, a controlled substance. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846.

We now turn to that analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 1, 2001, the STA clock was tolled upon the empanelment of the trial jury. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702494\"><a href=\"/opinion/702494/united-states-v-geraldo-rodriguez-aka-jose-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1159</span></a></span>, 1164 (1st Cir.1995). Prior to the time the jury was sworn, however, Valera entered into an agreement to cooperate with the government, and the government submitted a superseding indictment which added a conspiracy count against Reynoso. Thereafter, the district court dismissed the initial jury and scheduled a second jury empanelment for September 11, 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Of course, the period from August 1 to August 15 &#8212; the date of the superseding indictment &#8212; is excludable, in that the August 1 jury empanelment tolled the STA and there is no record evidence whatsoever that the government sought the initial jury empanelment as a pretext for delaying the trial. <i>See id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Motion to Suppress</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reynoso next contends that his signed confession should have been suppressed because the DEA agents (i) failed to accord him <i>Miranda</i> warnings, either in Spanish or in English, (ii) threatened him with deportation, (iii) declined his request to consult counsel, and (iv) recruited Valera to cajole him into confessing. Findings of fact made in relation to a motion to suppress are reviewed only for clear error. <i>United States v.

We discern no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was presented with conflicting testimony regarding each of these occurrences. Moreover, as the primary arbiter of witness credibility, the district court acted well within its prerogative in discrediting the version of the relevant events posited by Reynoso. <i>See United States v. Laine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199660\"><a href=\"/opinion/199660/united-states-v-laine/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir.2001); <i>see also United States v.

During trial, Reynoso maintained that so \"small\" an amount of cocaine plainly was intended exclusively for personal use, rather than distribution. Reynoso now challenges the admission into evidence of the expert testimony of DEA Agent Kathleen Kelleher &#8212; that the quantity of cocaine seized from Reynoso's car was too large to have been exclusively for his personal use &#8212; given that Agent Kelleher concededly had no personal experience with cocaine users, as distinguished from cocaine distributors. We discern no abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Diaz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200085\"><a href=\"/opinion/200085/united-states-v-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Due to her DEA experience, Agent Kelleher was competent to testify to the relative raw-weight distinctions in the drug quantities typically possessed by users as distinguished from dealers. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Valle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196494\"><a href=\"/opinion/196494/united-states-v-valle/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 214-15 (1st Cir.1995); <i>United States v.

Furthermore, as Reynoso was charged with distributing 500 or more grams of cocaine, and the government's evidence connected him to the kilogram of cocaine seized at Valera's store, <i>infra,</i> the conviction would stand even absent evidence that Reynoso intended to distribute the 110 grams. Consequently, any error in allowing Kelleher's testimony into evidence would have been harmless. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 103(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>The Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Reynoso contends that the government adduced no creditable evidence that he supplied the kilogram of cocaine found in Valera's store. We review <i>de novo</i> all the evidence, as well as all credibility determinations, in the light most favorable to the verdict to determine whether a rational jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>United States v. Morillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198160\"><a href=\"/opinion/198160/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Altogether aside from Reynoso's confession, Valera explicitly testified that Reynoso supplied the kilogram of cocaine seized at the store. Plainly, the mere fact that Valera cooperated with the government, in return for a more lenient sentence, did not render his testimony unreliable, <i>per se.</i> Moreover, the jury was fully apprised of the plea agreement Valera entered into with the government. <i>See United States v. Hernandez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197246\"><a href=\"/opinion/197246/united-states-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1997). Although Reynoso points out that the DEA task force did not see him deliver cocaine, notwithstanding its six-month surveillance of the Valera store, Valera's testimony was fully creditable absent further corroboration, <i>see id.,</i> and Reynoso plainly &#8212; and prudently &#8212; may have made these deliveries surreptitiously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Reynoso contends that there was insufficient evidence that he intended to distribute the 110 grams of cocaine seized from his car.
