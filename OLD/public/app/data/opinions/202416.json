Petitioner Sameh Awad, a thirty-\n\nsix-year-old native and citizen of Egypt, petitions for review of\n\na final order of removal of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA),\n\nwhich denied his petitions for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nprotection    under    the   Convention    Against    Torture   (CAT).     An\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ) denied the asylum petition on the grounds\n\nthat it was untimely, and also found that Awad had not demonstrated\n\nhis eligibility for withholding of removal or CAT relief.             The BIA\n\nagreed that the asylum petition was untimely, and also agreed that\n\nAwad was not eligible for either withholding of removal or CAT\n\nrelief, as he had not shown it was more likely than not that he\n\nwould be persecuted or tortured if he returned to Egypt.             We lack\n\njurisdiction to review the BIA's timeliness determination; as to\n\nthe other issues, we affirm the BIA and deny the petition.\n\n                                    I.\n\n           On or about October 29, 2001, Awad lawfully entered the\n\nUnited   States   as   a   non-immigrant   visitor.      He   was   initially\n\npermitted to remain in the country for a maximum of six months, but\n\nhe received an extension to stay until September 28, 2002.               Awad\n\nremained in the United States beyond that date, and on September\n\n24, 2003, he applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT\n\nprotection.    In support of his application, he claimed he was a\n\nCoptic Christian and that he feared persecution in Egypt on the\n\nbasis of his religious beliefs.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f          After being served with a Notice to Appear in removal\n\nproceedings, Awad conceded removability.    On December 7th, 2004, a\n\nremoval hearing was held before an IJ.     As an initial matter, the\n\ngovernment argued that the asylum petition was barred because it\n\nhad not been filed within one year of Awad's entry into the\n\ncountry, or within a reasonable time after the expiration of his\n\nlawful status.   The IJ decided to take that issue under advisement\n\nand proceed with the rest of the hearing.       The government then\n\nintroduced recent State Department reports on Egypt, including the\n\ngeneral Country Conditions Report and the Religious Freedom Report.\n\n          The sole witness at the hearing was Awad, who testified\n\nabout various incidents as follows.      In one, a Muslim neighbor\n\nattacked Awad when he was seven.      The neighbor, who was about\n\nAwad's age but much bigger in size, pushed him against some stairs\n\nand held his neck, threatening to severely injure Awad if he did\n\nnot pronounce that he was adopting Islam.    In another incident, in\n\nFebruary 1986, Awad saw a Muslim student and a Christian student\n\ntrade insults.   Although the Muslim student was the aggressor and\n\nstruck the Christian student, when the police intervened the\n\nChristian student received a more severe punishment.\n\n          Several other incidents occurred while Awad was in the\n\nEgyptian military. One, in 1990, occurred when he had just started\n\nworking in an army bakery.   When he made a mistake spreading the\n\ndough, his supervisor slapped him, even though the supervisor did\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fnot slap the Muslim soldiers for similar mistakes.              A fellow\n\nChristian soldier came to Awad's aid, and the fellow soldier and\n\nthe supervisor started hitting each other.      When a Muslim officer\n\nintervened, the supervisor was given no punishment, but Awad and\n\nhis fellow Christian soldier were ordered to stay in the barracks.\n\nIn a second incident, in 1991, a Muslim officer slapped Awad for\n\nnot hurrying up, even though he slapped no other soldiers.            In a\n\nthird incident, an officer took away a 10-day medical leave that\n\nAwad had been granted; the officer said he was taking it away\n\nbecause a Christian doctor had given Awad the leave and Awad did\n\nnot in fact deserve it.\n\n            Finally, Awad discussed an incident in which the 15-year-\n\nold sister of a close friend had been kidnapped, raped, and forced\n\nto convert to Islam and marry her attacker, and in which the police\n\nhad refused to intervene. He also testified that similar incidents\n\ncontinued to occur in Egypt.\n\n            On cross-examination, the government elicited that Awad\n\nhad previously been in the United States from July of 2000 to May\n\nof 2001 and had returned to Egypt after that trip.         He had also\n\nvisited Australia for two months in 1999 and 2000 and then returned\n\nto Egypt.    On neither of these trips had he applied for asylum.\n\n            In an oral decision issued the same day, the IJ denied\n\nthe   petitions   for   asylum,   withholding   of   removal,   and    CAT\n\nprotection.    As a threshold matter, the IJ found Awad's testimony\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fto be credible.    Turning to the asylum issue, the IJ ruled that the\n\napplication was untimely because it was not filed within one year\n\nof Awad's arrival in the country.         In any event, the IJ noted that\n\nhe would have denied the asylum application on the merits.           As for\n\nthe withholding of removal and CAT claims, the IJ found that Awad\n\nhad not shown that it was more likely than not that he would be\n\nsubject to persecution or torture as a result of his religious\n\nbeliefs. According to the IJ, the incidents Awad described did not\n\nrise to the level of past persecution1 and fell far short of\n\nestablishing that it was more likely than not that Awad would\n\nsuffer future persecution -- a finding that was further supported\n\nby Awad's willingness to return to Egypt twice after international\n\ntravel, both times without incident.             The IJ did grant Awad\n\nvoluntary departure.\n\n          On September 26, 2005, the BIA issued a per curiam\n\nopinion agreeing with the IJ's ultimate conclusions.             The asylum\n\npetition was time barred because it had not been filed within one\n\nyear of Awad's entry into the United States.            Moreover, Awad was\n\nnot eligible for an exception since the 11-month delay between the\n\nexpiration   of   his   lawful   status   and   his   filing   exceeded   the\n\n\"reasonable period\" provided for under 8 C.F.R. ยง 1208.4(a)(5)(iv).\n\nAdditionally, the BIA upheld the IJ's denial of withholding of\n\n\n\n     1\n       The IJ also found that the bakery incident had been\nmotivated by Awad's poor baking skills, and not by Awad's religion.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fremoval and CAT protection. It found that Awad had not established\n\npast persecution because the incidents he described did not rise to\n\nthe level of persecution.             Also, Awad had not shown that it was\n\nmore likely than not that he would be persecuted in Egypt on the\n\nbasis of his religion, or that he would be tortured there.\n\n               As   part   of   his   appeal    to   the    BIA,    Awad   submitted\n\nadditional background evidence, which consisted of news stories and\n\nhuman rights group reports of various incidents where Egyptian\n\nCoptic Christians had suffered religiously motivated violence,\n\nforced conversions, rape, or other abuses.                    The BIA considered\n\nthese documents, but found that they were repetitive or cumulative\n\nof other background evidence before the IJ and would not change the\n\nresult.    The BIA specifically noted that just because \"conditions\n\nare difficult for millions of Coptic Christians in Egypt does not\n\nsuffice to establish that [Awad] meets the legal requirements of\n\nour immigration laws.\"\n\n                                         II.\n\n               For the issues over which we have jurisdiction, we review\n\nthe    BIA's    factual    findings     under    the   \"substantial        evidence\"\n\nstandard.       Guzman v. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).                Under\n\nthis    deferential        standard,     we     must       accept    the    agency's\n\ndetermination \"unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled\n\nto conclude to the contrary.\"            Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fF.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting 8 U.S.C. ยง 1252(b)(4)(B))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            We have no jurisdiction to review the BIA's determination\n\nthat   Awad's   asylum      application        was   untimely.      See   8   U.S.C.\n\nยง 1158(a)(3); see also Sharari v. Gonzales, 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (noting that the statute's jurisdictional bar applies\n\nboth to the BIA's determination that the petition was untimely, and\n\nto   its   decision    that    no     exception      applies).      However,   this\n\njurisdictional bar does not apply to Awad's withholding of removal\n\nand CAT claims.        See Sharari, 407 F.3d at 474 n.5; Njenga v.\n\nAshcroft, 386 F.3d 335, 339-40 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            To qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must\n\nshow that it is \"more likely than not\" that he would be subject to\n\npersecution     on    the     basis    of   \"race,      religion,    nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\"\n\nSharari, 407 F.3d at 474.        The petitioner bears the burden of proof\n\non this issue.       8 C.F.R. ยง 208.16(b).           However, if the petitioner\n\nshows he has suffered past persecution, a presumption arises that\n\nhe is likely to suffer future persecution. See id. ยง 208.16(b)(1).\n\nDemonstrating eligibility for withholding of removal requires a\n\nhigher showing than demonstrating eligibility for asylum, as the\n\nlatter requires only a showing that the petitioner has \"a well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution.\"           Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565,\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f569    n.3   (1st     Cir.    1999)   (citing       8   U.S.C.    ยงยง    1101(a)(42)(A),\n\n1158(b)(1)).\n\n               Substantial evidence supports the BIA's determination\n\nthat    Awad's       past    experiences      did   not    rise    to    the    level   of\n\npersecution.          In defining persecution, we have explained that\n\n\"persecution encompasses more than threats to life or freedom, but\n\nless than mere harassment or annoyance.\"                   Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d\n\nat 570 (internal citation omitted).                 Here, the incidents that Awad\n\nhimself suffered essentially amount to being pushed around and\n\nthreatened with injury once during his early youth, being slapped\n\non two occasions while in the army in the early 1990s, witnessing\n\nseveral instances of unfair treatment against fellow Christians,\n\nand    learning      that    a   close   friend's       sister    had    been   sexually\n\nassaulted and forced to convert.\n\n               We have upheld BIA findings of no persecution in cases\n\nwith more -- or at least similarly -- oppressive facts.                        See, e.g.,\n\nTopalli v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 128, 132 (1st Cir. 2005) (petitioner\n\nwas detained for less than 24 hours on a number of occasions and\n\nbeaten by the police, though the beatings did not require medical\n\nattention); Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 264 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(petitioner was held in solitary confinement for less than seventy-\n\ntwo    hours    on    three      different    occasions,     each       accompanied     by\n\nphysical abuse, and was subject to \"regular harassment in the form\n\nof periodic surveillance, threatening phone calls, occasional stops\n\n\n                                             -8-\n\fand searches, and visits to her place of work\").        On the facts of\n\nAwad's case, we cannot say that the mistreatment he suffered\n\n\"extends so far beyond 'harassment and annoyance' so as to compel\n\na reasonable factfinder to find past persecution.\"             Nelson, 232\n\nF.3d at 264.\n\n          Substantial     evidence     also      supports      the     BIA's\n\ndetermination as to future persecution.        At best, Awad's evidence\n\nshowed that of the millions of Coptic Christians living in Egypt,\n\nsome have been subject to persecution.        That is not a showing that\n\nit is more likely than not that Awad will be subjected to religious\n\npersecution upon his return.         Indeed, the State Department's\n\nReligious Freedom Report cuts against such a finding, noting that\n\n\"for the most part, members of the non-Muslim minority worship\n\nwithout harassment.\"      Additionally, the fact that Awad twice\n\nreturned to Egypt after international travel, both times without\n\nincident, further supports the BIA's conclusion.\n\n          Awad   nevertheless   argues,   citing    language    from   this\n\ncourt's opinion in Davila-Bardales v. INS, 27 F.3d 1, 5-6, (1st\n\nCir. 1994), that the BIA's decision in his case was arbitrary and\n\ninconsistent.    In support of this, he points to a 1997 unpublished\n\nBIA decision granting asylum to an Egyptian Coptic Christian based\n\non a well-founded fear of persecution.    But as the BIA noted, there\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fis no inconsistency. Unlike Awad's case, the 1997 case was decided\n\nunder the more lenient asylum standard.2\n\n          Finally,   substantial   evidence    supports   the   BIA's\n\nresolution of Awad's CAT claim.    To qualify for protection under\n\nthe CAT, Awad must show that it is more likely than not that he\n\nwould be tortured if he were removed to Egypt.      See Guzman, 327\n\nF.3d at 16 (citing 8 C.F.R. ยง 208.16(c)(2)).      Under the federal\n\nregulations defining torture, this means Awad must show he will be\n\n\"subject to 'severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental'\n\nby or at 'the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of\n\na public official or other person acting in an official capacity.'\"\n\nId. at 17 (quoting 8 C.F.R. ยง 208.18(a)(1)).    Awad did not present\n\nany evidence that met this burden.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       Awad also tries to draw support from the Ninth Circuit's\ndecision in Malty v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 942 (2004). But that case,\nwhich in any event was decided in a different procedural posture,\nwas also an asylum case.\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

Moreover, Awad was not eligible for an exception since the 11-month delay between the expiration of his lawful status and his filing exceeded the \"reasonable period\" provided for under 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.4(a)(5)(iv). Additionally, the BIA upheld the IJ's denial of withholding of removal and CAT protection. It found that Awad had not established past persecution because the incidents he described did not rise to the level of persecution.

The BIA considered these documents, but found that they were repetitive or cumulative of other background evidence before the IJ and would not change the result. The BIA specifically noted that just because \"conditions are difficult for millions of Coptic Christians in Egypt does not suffice to establish that [Awad] meets the legal requirements of our immigration laws.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the issues over which we have jurisdiction, we review the BIA's factual findings under the \"substantial evidence\" standard. <i>Guzman v.

That is not a showing that it is more likely than not that Awad will be subjected to religious persecution upon his return. Indeed, the State Department's Religious Freedom Report cuts against such a finding, noting that \"for the most part, members of the non-Muslim minority worship without harassment.\" Additionally, the fact that Awad twice returned to Egypt after international travel, both times without incident, further supports the BIA's conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Awad nevertheless argues, citing language from this court's opinion in <i>Davila-Bardales v.

In support of this, he points to a 1997 unpublished BIA decision granting asylum to an Egyptian Coptic Christian based on a well-founded fear of persecution.

An Immigration Judge (IJ) denied the asylum petition on the grounds that it was untimely, and also found that Awad had not demonstrated his eligibility for withholding of removal or CAT relief. The BIA agreed that the asylum petition was untimely, and also agreed that Awad was not eligible for either withholding of removal or CAT relief, as he had not shown it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted or tortured if he returned to Egypt. We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA's timeliness determination; as to the other issues, we affirm the BIA and deny the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about October 29, 2001, Awad lawfully entered the United States as a non-immigrant visitor. He was initially permitted to remain in the country for a maximum of six months, but he received an extension to stay until September 28, 2002. Awad remained in the United States beyond that date, and on September 24, 2003, he applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection. In support of his application, he claimed he was a Coptic Christian and that he feared persecution in Egypt on the basis of his religious beliefs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After being served with a Notice to Appear in removal proceedings, Awad conceded removability. On December 7th, 2004, a removal hearing was held before an IJ. As an initial matter, the government argued that the asylum petition was barred because it had not been filed within one year of Awad's entry into the country, or within a reasonable time after the expiration of his lawful status. The IJ decided to take that issue under advisement and proceed with the rest of the hearing. The government then introduced recent State Department reports on Egypt, including the general Country Conditions Report and the Religious Freedom Report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sole witness at the hearing was Awad, who testified about various incidents as follows. In one, a Muslim neighbor attacked Awad when he was seven. The neighbor, who was about Awad's age but much bigger in size, pushed him against some stairs and held his neck, threatening to severely injure Awad if he did not pronounce that he was adopting Islam. In another incident, in February 1986, Awad saw a Muslim student and a Christian student trade insults. Although the Muslim student was the aggressor and struck the Christian student, when the police intervened the Christian student received a more severe punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several other incidents occurred while Awad was in the Egyptian military. One, in 1990, occurred when he had just started working in an army bakery. When he made a mistake spreading the dough, his supervisor slapped him, even though the supervisor did not slap the Muslim soldiers for similar mistakes. A fellow Christian soldier came to Awad's aid, and the fellow soldier and the supervisor started hitting each other. When a Muslim officer intervened, the supervisor was given no punishment, but Awad and his fellow Christian soldier were ordered to stay in the barracks. In a second incident, in 1991, a Muslim officer slapped Awad for not hurrying up, even though he slapped no other soldiers. In a third incident, an officer took away a 10-day medical leave that Awad had been granted; the officer said he was taking it away because a Christian doctor had given Awad the leave and Awad did not in fact deserve it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Awad discussed an incident in which the 15-year-old sister of a close friend had been kidnapped, raped, and forced to convert to Islam and marry her attacker, and in which the police had refused to intervene. He also testified that similar incidents continued to occur in Egypt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, the government elicited that Awad had previously been in the United States from July of 2000 to May of 2001 and had returned to Egypt after that trip. He had also visited Australia for two months in 1999 and 2000 and then returned to Egypt. On neither of these trips had he applied for asylum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an oral decision issued the same day, the IJ denied the petitions for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection. As a threshold matter, the IJ found Awad's testimony to be credible. Turning to the asylum issue, the IJ ruled that the application was untimely because it was not filed within one year of Awad's arrival in the country. In any event, the IJ noted that he would have denied the asylum application on the merits. As for the withholding of removal and CAT claims, the IJ found that Awad had not shown that it was more likely than not that he would be subject to persecution or torture as a result of his religious beliefs. According to the IJ, the incidents Awad described did not rise to the level of past persecution<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and fell far short of establishing that it was more likely than not that Awad would suffer future persecution &#8212; a finding that was further supported by Awad's willingness to return to Egypt twice after international travel, both times without incident.
