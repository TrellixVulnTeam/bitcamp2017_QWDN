Appellant Clara Estades-\n\nNegroni (\"Estades\") brought this action in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Puerto Rico against CPC Hospital\n\nSan Juan Capestrano (\"CPC Hospital\"), a private hospital, First\n\nOption    Corporation    Puerto    Rico    (\"First   Option\"),    a   private\n\nhealthcare   services    provider,    and    several   private    physicians\n\n(collectively, \"Appellees\") after she was involuntarily committed\n\nto CPC Hospital.    In her complaint, Estades alleged that Appellees\n\nwere liable under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 for violating her\n\nrights under the United States Constitution in connection with her\n\ncommitment. Estades also asserted that Appellees were liable under\n\nthe Constitution and laws of Puerto Rico.              Appellees moved the\n\ndistrict court to dismiss the federal claims pursuant to Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)1 on the ground that they are not\n\nstate actors and, therefore, are not subject to suit under § 1983.2\n\nThe   district   court   granted    the    motion,   declined    to   exercise\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims, and\n\nthen dismissed the action.           Estades now seeks review of the\n\ndistrict court's finding that Appellees are not state actors and\n\nthe resulting dismissal of her action.          We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      Rule 12(b)(6) provides for dismissal if there is a \"failure\nto state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\"\n      2\n      Estades' § 1988 claim is entirely dependent on the viability\nof her § 1983 claim.\n\n                                     -3-\n\f                            I.    Background\n\n            We recount and, for purposes of this appeal, accept as\n\ntrue the allegations in Estades' complaint.3         See Rockwell v. Cape\n\nCod Hosp., 26 F.3d 254, 255 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n           In September 1996, Estades sought and began to receive\n\npsychiatric treatment from Doctor Luis E. Canepa (\"Canepa\"), an\n\nemployee and director of First Option, at the facilities of First\n\nOption.    Her treatment was provided pursuant to the Puerto Rico\n\nHealth Reform Plan (the \"Plan\"), which was enacted to ensure that\n\nmedically indigent residents of Puerto Rico receive quality medical\n\ncare.    See 24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 7001.\n\n           In accordance with the Plan, the Puerto Rico Health\n\nInsurance Administration (the \"Administration\"), an instrumentality\n\nof the government of Puerto Rico, was created to implement a health\n\ninsurance system for the medically indigent.             See id. §§ 7003-04.\n\nAs a means to fulfill its primary purpose, the Administration was\n\ngiven the authority to contract with private health insurance\n\ncarriers   to   arrange   for    the    provision   of    medical   care   to\n\n\n\n     3\n      Estades originally filed her complaint on April 30, 1999, but\nshe filed an amended complaint on September 10, 1999.           The\nallegations are taken from the amended complaint.        There are\nseveral instances where the complaint references, both directly and\nindirectly, statutes of Puerto Rico.       In those instances, we\nconsider, and cite to, those statutes. See Rodi v. S. New Eng.\nSch. of Law, 389 F.3d 5, 12 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"In ruling on whether\na plaintiff has stated an actionable claim, an inquiring court . .\n. must consider the complaint . . . and other materials fairly\nincorporated within it.\").\n\n                                       -4-\n\findigents.4   See id. § 7026.     The carriers were then to hire\n\nmedical professionals, and it was these professionals who were to\n\nprovide the care.    Acting under the Plan, the Administration\n\ncontracted with Triple S, a private health insurance carrier, and\n\nTriple S, in turn, contracted with First Option and Canepa.5\n\n          Between September 1996 and April 1997, Canepa treated\n\nEstades on a regular basis.     He diagnosed her as suffering from\n\ndepression and prescribed for her a variety of medications.     In\n\nApril 1997, Estades' mental health worsened and Canepa began\n\ndiscussing her condition with her son, Leonardo Velazquez Estades\n\n(\"Velazquez\").\n\n          On May 4, 1997, after consulting with Canepa, Velazquez\n\nbrought Estades to CPC Hospital, rather than to his house, where\n\nEstades thought that he was taking her.      Upon arriving at CPC\n\nHospital, Estades expressed a desire to leave.    However, she was\n\nforcibly restrained, injected with medication, and placed in a\n\n\n     4\n      The responsibilities of the Administration are carried out by\nits board of directors, which consists of seven individuals. See\n24 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 7004-05. The complaint alleges that Canepa\nwas \"the Administrator of the Plan's mental health services\nnetwork.\" Neither the complaint nor the parties' briefs expand on\nthe responsibilities that Canepa would have had as \"Administrator\nof the Plan's mental health services network.\" In any event, the\ncomplaint does not allege that Canepa was one of the members of the\nAdministration's board of directors, and therefore, we assume that\nhe was not.\n     5\n      Because the complaint alleges that Triple S contracted with\nboth First Option and Canepa, we assume that it did. See Rockwell,\n26 F.3d at 255. However, we doubt that Triple S was in a direct\ncontractual relationship with Canepa, an employee of First Option.\n\n                                -5-\n\fsecluded room.        That same day, Canepa sent a letter to CPC Hospital\n\nin which he assured the Hospital that it would soon receive written\n\nauthorization for Estades' commitment.\n\n            Velazquez, acting pursuant to Puerto Rico Law 116 (\"Law\n\n116\"), 24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 6001 et seq., then filed a petition with\n\nthe Court of First Instance for San Juan, Puerto Rico, the local\n\ntrial court, requesting that it authorize Estades' involuntary\n\nhospitalization.        See id. § 6002.        In Puerto Rico, an individual\n\ncan be involuntarily committed only pursuant to a court order. See\n\nid. § 6004.      One or more Appellees also filed documents with the\n\nCourt of First Instance in support of Velazquez's petition.               See\n\nid. § 6003.\n\n            Estades remained involuntarily committed at CPC Hospital\n\nfor a period of nineteen days.6          During that time, she alleges that\n\nshe   was   secluded     from   other    patients,   physically    restrained,\n\ninjected with medication against her will, physically assaulted by\n\nan    employee   of    CPC   Hospital,    and   physically   and   emotionally\n\nmistreated by other Hospital employees. At the end of the nineteen\n\ndays, and as a condition of her discharge, Estades claims that she\n\nwas coerced into agreeing that her commitment had been voluntary.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      We assume that the Court of First Instance granted\nVelazquez's petition. However, the complaint is silent on this\ntopic.    Nevertheless, whether the Court of First Instance\nultimately granted the petition does not affect our inquiry into\nwhether Appellees are subject to suit under § 1983.\n\n                                         -6-\n\f             Following her discharge, Estades brought this action\n\nagainst First Option, Canepa, CPC Hospital, and a number of private\n\nphysicians who had interacted with her during her hospitalization.\n\nIn the complaint, Estades asserted federal and state causes of\n\naction, including a § 1983 claim, against each Appellee.           The\n\nfederal counts were dependent on the viability of the § 1983 claim.\n\nOn Appellees' motion, the district court dismissed the federal\n\ncounts, based on its finding that Estades had failed to allege\n\nsufficient facts to establish that Appellees were state actors and,\n\nthus, subject to suit under § 1983.     The district court determined\n\nthat Estades could not show state action under any of the following\n\nthree tests we have employed to decide whether a private party\n\nshould be treated as a state actor:     the state compulsion test, the\n\nnexus/joint action test, and the public function test.            Then,\n\nacting pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3),7 the district court\n\nrefused to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining\n\nstate law claims and, consequently, dismissed the entire action.8\n\n             Estades appeals the dismissal of her § 1983 claim and the\n\nresulting dismissal of her § 1988 claim and state law claims.        Of\n\ncourse, if the § 1983 claim was subject to dismissal, then the\n\n\n\n     7\n      Section 1367(c) provides that a \"district court[] may decline\nto exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim . . . if . . .\n(3) [it] has dismissed all claims over which it has original\njurisdiction . . . .\"\n     8\n         The state law claims were dismissed without prejudice.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fdistrict court had the authority to dismiss the § 1988 claim, as\n\nwell as the state law claims.       See § 1367(c)(3).   Therefore, we\n\nmust decide whether the district court erred in dismissing the §\n\n1983 claim.\n\n                            II.   Discussion\n\n          We review the district court's dismissal of Estades' §\n\n1983 claim de novo.   Rockwell, 26 F.3d at 255.\n\n          Section 1983 \"provides a remedy for deprivations of\n\nrights secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States\n\nwhen that deprivation takes place 'under color of any statute,\n\nordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . . .'\"\n\nLugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 924 (1982) (quoting §\n\n1983).   Therefore, a plaintiff claiming a § 1983 violation must\n\nallege that a person or persons acting under color of state law9\n\ndeprived him of a federal constitutional or statutory right.      See\n\nRockwell, 26 F.3d at 256.    If the plaintiff fails to allege facts\n\nsufficient to establish either the deprivation of a federal right\n\nor that the defendant or defendants acted under color of state law,\n\nthen the § 1983 claim is subject to dismissal.\n\n          Here, there is no dispute that Estades, in asserting that\n\nshe was involuntarily committed, alleged the deprivation of a\n\n\n     9\n      \"For the purposes of section 1983, Puerto Rico enjoys the\nfunctional equivalent of statehood, and thus the term state law\nincludes Puerto Rico law.\"    Barrios-Velazquez v. Asociacion de\nEmpleados del Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, 84 F.3d 487,\n491 n.2 (1st Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                   -8-\n\ffederal right.     See, e.g., Harvey v. Harvey, 949 F.2d 1127, 1130\n\n(11th Cir. 1992) (holding that an individual who is involuntarily\n\ncommitted is deprived of his constitutional right to liberty). The\n\ndisagreement is over whether she alleged facts sufficient to\n\nestablish that Appellees, private individuals and entities, acted\n\nunder color of state law when they participated in her involuntary\n\ncommitment.   For Appellees to have acted under color of state law,\n\ntheir actions must be \"fairly attributable to the State.\"        Lugar,\n\n457 U.S. at 937.    In other words, it must be fair to characterize\n\nthem as state actors.    See id.10\n\n          It is \"[o]nly in rare circumstances\" that private parties\n\ncan be viewed as state actors.       Harvey, 949 F.2d at 1130.   We have\n\nemployed the following three tests to determine whether a private\n\n\n\n     10\n      In Lugar, 457 U.S. at 937, the Supreme Court articulated a\ntwo-part test that must be satisfied before it can be said that\n\"the conduct allegedly causing the deprivation of a federal right\n[is] fairly attributable to the State\":\n     First, the deprivation must be caused by the exercise of\n     some right or privilege created by the State or by a rule\n     of conduct imposed by the State or by a person for whom\n     the State is responsible. . . . [And, s]econd, the party\n     charged with the deprivation must be a person who may\n     fairly be said to be a state actor.\nAlthough the two parts of the test merge \"when the claim of a\nconstitutional deprivation is directed against a party whose\nofficial character is such as to lend the weight of the State to\nhis decisions,\" they \"diverge when the constitutional claim is\ndirected against a party without such apparent authority, i.e.,\nagainst a private party.\" Id. Hence, the two parts of the test\ndiverge in this case.     Nonetheless, in her complaint, Estades\nalleged facts sufficient to satisfy the first part of the test--she\nalleged that Appellees acted pursuant to Law 116, a state statute.\nConsequently, our focus is on the second part of the test.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fparty fairly can be characterized as a state actor:                the state\n\ncompulsion test, the nexus/joint action test, and the public\n\nfunction   test.      Rockwell,   26   F.3d    at    257;   see   Perkins   v.\n\nLondonderry Basketball Club, 196 F.3d 13, 18-21 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nThe district court considered each of these tests on the assumption\n\nthat, were any of them met, the state action requirement would be\n\nsatisfied.    The parties accepted this approach, and therefore, we\n\nfollow it as well.\n\n           Under the state compulsion test, a private party is\n\nfairly characterized as a state actor when the state \"has exercised\n\ncoercive power or has provided such significant encouragement,\n\neither overt or covert, that the [challenged conduct] must in law\n\nbe deemed to be that of the State.\"           Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S.\n\n991, 1004 (1982).       The nexus/joint action test provides that a\n\nprivate party can be held to be a state actor where an examination\n\nof the totality of the circumstances reveals that the state has \"so\n\nfar insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with the\n\n[private party] that it was a joint participant in [the challenged\n\nactivity].\"    Bass v. Parkwood Hosp., 180 F.3d 234, 242 (5th Cir.\n\n1999) (internal quotation marks omitted) (first alteration in\n\noriginal); see Perkins, 196 F.3d at 21.             And, in accordance with\n\nthe public function test, a private party is viewed as a state\n\nactor if     the   plaintiff   establishes    that,    in   engaging   in   the\n\nchallenged conduct, the private party performed a public function\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fthat has been \"traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the\n\nState.\" Blum, 457 U.S. at 1005 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          We now address whether Estades' complaint alleged facts\n\nsufficient to support a finding that Appellees are fairly regarded\n\nas state actors under any of the above tests.11     We recognize that\n\n\"[u]nder any formula . . . , the [determination as to] whether\n\nprivate conduct is fairly attributable to the state must be [made]\n\nbased on the circumstances of each case.\"      Bass, 180 F.3d at 242.\n\nA.        State Compulsion Test\n\n          Here, there can be no finding of state action under the\n\nstate compulsion test, as Estades failed to allege facts that would\n\nsupport a finding that the state coerced or encouraged Appellees to\n\npursue or otherwise participate in her involuntary commitment.     To\n\nbe sure, Estades alleged that Appellees acted in accordance with\n\nthe procedures outlined in the state statutory scheme established\n\nto govern involuntary commitment.      See 24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 6001 et\n\nseq. However, that scheme does not compel or encourage involuntary\n\ncommitment.12   Rather, it merely provides a mechanism through which\n\n\n     11\n      Although Estades did not clearly articulate an argument under\nthe state compulsion test on appeal, Appellees addressed the issue\nand, for the sake of completeness, so do we.\n     12\n      Although 24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 6001 provides that \"[e]very\nperson over 18 years of age who is subject to involuntary admission\nand immediate hospitalization must be admitted to a mental health\nfacility according to the provisions of this code\" (emphasis\nadded), a review of the entire commitment scheme reveals that it\ngives considerable discretion to private parties. Before a court\ncan order involuntary commitment, it must be presented with a\n\n                                -11-\n\fprivate parties can, in their discretion, pursue such commitment.\n\nThus, that allegation does not support a finding of state action.\n\nSee Barrios-Velazquez v. Asociacion de Empleados del Estado Libre\n\nAsociado de Puerto Rico, 84 F.3d 487, 493 (1st Cir. 1996); see also\n\nHarvey, 949 F.2d at 1131 (\"[Appellant] cannot seriously allege that\n\nthe relevant provisions of the [statutory scheme] were enacted\n\nbecause the state wants to encourage commitments . . . .\" (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)).    Estades also alleged that a state\n\ninstrumentality was charged with implementing the health insurance\n\nsystem under which Appellees acted and that a state court was\n\ninvolved in her commitment.   Still, she did not allege that the\n\ninstrumentality or court coerced or encouraged Appellees to act in\n\nconnection with her commitment.   Therefore, those allegations also\n\nfail to support a finding of state action.\n\n\n\n\npetition for such commitment by \"any person 18 years old or over,\"\nid. § 6002(a), and a certificate from a psychiatrist indicating\nthat the individual in question \"is subject to . . . and needs . .\n. admission,\" id. § 6003. Significantly, even \"[w]hen a person is\nsubject to involuntary admission and in such a condition that\nimmediate hospitalization is necessary,\" the scheme merely provides\nthat \"any person 18 years old or over may file [the required]\npetition in court.\" Id. § 6002(a) (emphasis added). Moreover, the\nscheme does not coerce or encourage psychiatrists to issue the\naforementioned certificates or hospitals (or their employees) to\npursue or otherwise participate in an involuntary commitment. Cf.\nS.P. v. City of Takoma Park, 134 F.3d 260, 268 (4th Cir. 1998) (\"We\nconclude . . . that the statutory scheme, when viewed as a whole,\nis more permissive than mandatory, and that it grants private\nphysicians complete medical discretion in determining whether an\nindividual should be involuntarily committed.\").\n\n                               -12-\n\fB.        Nexus/Joint Action Test\n\n          Further, Estades has failed to plead sufficient facts to\n\njustify a finding of state action under the nexus/joint action\n\ntest.   The complaint simply does not indicate that the state \"so\n\nfar insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with\n\n[Appellees] that it [should be considered] a joint participant in\"\n\ntheir actions pertaining to the involuntary commitment in question.\n\nBass, 180 F.3d at 242 (internal quotation marks omitted) (first\n\nalteration in original).         The complaint does allege that:            state\n\nstatutes provide the mechanism for involuntary commitment; the\n\nstate extensively regulates such commitment; Appellees received\n\nmoney   derived     from   the    state;    and   Appellees    sought   court\n\nauthorization for Estades' commitment. However, even if true, none\n\nof that would justify a finding that Appellees are state actors.\n\nSee, e.g., id. at 243 (\"The fact that the defendants . . . invoked\n\nthe assistance of the courts . . . is not sufficient to show a\n\nnexus or joint effort between the defendants and the state.\");\n\nRockwell, 26 F.3d at 258 (\"[G]overnment regulation, even extensive\n\nregulation,   and    the   receipt    of    [public]   funds    .   .   .    are\n\ninsufficient to [satisfy the nexus/joint action test].\"); Spencer\n\nv. Lee, 864 F.2d 1376, 1381 (7th Cir. 1989) (finding that a private\n\nparty is not transformed into a state actor merely because the\n\nprivate party acted pursuant to a state statute).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\f            Moreover, the complaint does not allege that the state\n\nwas in any way, much less intimately, involved in the initial\n\ndecision to pursue involuntary commitment,13 or in later decisions\n\nconcerning the treatment Estades allegedly received while she was\n\ncommitted.     See Perkins, 196 F.3d at 21 (finding significant \"the\n\nextent to which the private entity is (or is not) independent in\n\nthe conduct of its day-to-day affairs); cf. Jensen v. Lane County,\n\n222 F.3d 570, 575 (9th Cir. 2000) (\"The record is clear that\n\n[defendant] and the County through its employees have undertaken a\n\ncomplex and deeply intertwined process of evaluating and detaining\n\nindividuals who are believed to be mentally ill . . . .          County\n\nemployees     initiate   the   evaluation   process   [and]   there   is\n\nsignificant consultation . . . among . . . [private] psychiatrists\n\nand county . . . workers . . . .\").      On the facts alleged, we fail\n\nto see how Estades could show that a relationship existed between\n\nAppellees and the state that would justify a finding of state\n\naction under this test.\n\n             In her appellate brief, seemingly in an effort to augment\n\nher nexus/joint action argument, Estades asserts that because\n\nAppellees \"were employed by the [state]\" to provide psychiatric\n\ntreatment pursuant to the Plan, they are properly characterized as\n\nstate actors.    To support her assertion, she cites West v. Atkins,\n\n\n     13\n      It asserts that Estades' son, after consulting with Canepa,\npetitioned a court to authorize her commitment, and that one or\nmore Appellees filed documents in support of the petition.\n\n                                  -14-\n\f487 U.S. 42 (1988), a case in which the Supreme Court held that a\n\nprivate physician under contract with the state to provide medical\n\ncare to prison inmates was a state actor.   However, her complaint\n\ncannot fairly be read to allege that any Appellee was employed by,\n\nor otherwise bound to, the state.14   Therefore, Estades' reliance\n\non West is misplaced, see Ellison v. Garbarino, 48 F.3d 192, 197\n\n(6th Cir. 1995) (\"[T]he West case does not govern [because] . . .\n\n[t]he present defendants are in no way contractually bound to the\n\nstate.\"),15 and her employment argument fails.\n\n\n     14\n       In a single sentence, the complaint states: \"As participants\nin the . . . Plan, [Appellees] were contracted by\" the state. But,\nneither that statement nor the assertion in Estades' brief that\nAppellees \"were employed by the [state]\" can be squared with the\nfacts alleged or statutes fairly referenced in the complaint. As\nwe have stated, the complaint alleges that an instrumentality of\nthe state, the Administration, acting in accordance with the Plan,\ncontracted with a private health insurance carrier, Triple S,\nwhich, in turn, contracted with First Option and Canepa. A review\nof the statute governing the Administration's ability to enter into\ncontracts reveals that the administration is only authorized to\ncontract with \"insurers licensed to do health insurance business in\nPuerto Rico.\"    24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 7026.      Thus, the complaint\nalleges, and the statutes referenced therein confirm, that it was\nonly to Triple S, and not to the state, that First Option and\nCanepa were bound. Moreover, the complaint does not allege any\nfacts that support the assertion that CPC Hospital or its employees\nwere employed by the state (or, for that matter, Triple S). See\nRodi v. S. New Eng. Sch. of Law, 389 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2004) (In\nreviewing a complaint in an appeal from a grant of a motion to\ndismiss, \"[w]e ignore . . . bald assertions . . . [and]\nunsubstantiated conclusions . . . .\" (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n     15\n      In addition, West is distinguishable from the case at hand\nbecause in West, the defendant-physician's actions took place\nwithin a state-run prison hospital and the plaintiff-prisoner was\nprecluded by state law from seeking treatment from a physician of\nhis own choosing. 487 U.S. at 43-44. Here, however, the actions\n\n                               -15-\n\f              Moreover, Estades, citing Lugar, 457 U.S. at 941, claims\n\nthat Appellees should be regarded as state actors \"because they\n\nrelied      upon   an   unconstitutional    state   statut[ory   scheme]   to\n\ninvoluntarily hospitalize\" her.        But, Lugar makes clear that even\n\nthough \"the procedural scheme created by [a] statute . . . is the\n\nproduct of state action,\"        id., a private party normally does not\n\nbecome a state actor merely by invoking it.              See id. at 939 n.21\n\n(\"[W]e do not hold today that a private party's mere invocation of\n\nstate    legal      procedures   constitutes     joint    participation    or\n\nconspiracy with state officials satisfying the § 1983 requirement\n\nof action under color of law.        The holding today . . . is limited\n\nto the particular context of prejudgment attachment.\" (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted)); see also Spencer, 864 F.2d\n\nat 1381 (\"The statutes authorizing . . . private activities may or\n\nmay   not    be    constitutional;   the    activities    themselves   remain\n\nprivate.\" (internal citations omitted)).\n\nC.            Public Function Test\n\n              Having found no state action under the above two tests,\n\nwe turn to the last of the three tests:         the public function test.\n\nAs has been said, there can be state action under this test only if\n\nAppellees performed a public function that was \"traditionally the\n\n\n\n\nin question occurred within a private hospital and, in theory,\nEstades was free to seek treatment from physicians other than those\nassociated with the Plan.\n\n                                     -16-\n\fexclusive prerogative of the State.\"         Blum, 457 U.S. at 1005.16    In\n\nher complaint, and on appeal, Estades makes two public function\n\narguments:        first, she alleges that Appellees, \"in causing [her]\n\ninvoluntary commitment,\" performed a public function; and, second,\n\nshe asserts that Appellees \"performed the public function of\n\nproviding    free     medical   and   psychiatric   services   to   indigent\"\n\npersons.     We now address the two arguments, beginning with the\n\ninvoluntary commitment argument.\n\n             1.    Involuntary Commitment\n\n             There can be no finding of state action under the public\n\nfunction test in connection with Estades' involuntary commitment.\n\nThis is because involuntary commitment is not a function that is or\n\nhas been reserved exclusively to the state in Puerto Rico, and\n\ntherefore, Appellees, in pursuing or otherwise participating in\n\nEstades' commitment, could not have performed a public function\n\nwithin the meaning of this test.         See P.R. Laws Ann. § 6001 et seq.\n\n(indicating that private parties have been intimately involved in\n\nthe involuntary commitment process in Puerto Rico since 1980)17; see\n\n\n     16\n      The few activities that have been found to satisfy this\ndemanding standard include \"the administration of elections, the\noperation of a company town, eminent domain, peremptory challenges\nin jury selection, and, in at least limited circumstances, the\noperation of a municipal park.\" Perkins, 196 F.3d at 19 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). \"When a plaintiff ventures [beyond this\nshort list of activities], she has an uphill climb.\" Id.\n     17\n      For example, the statutory scheme governing involuntary\ncommitment in Puerto Rico since 1980, 24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 6001 et\nseq., provides that:    \"any person 18 years old or over\" may\n\n                                      -17-\n\falso Jackson v. Metro. Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 352-53 (1974) (\"If\n\nwe were dealing with the exercise by [Appellee] of some power\n\ndelegated to it by the State which is traditionally associated with\n\nsovereignty, such as eminent domain, our case would be quite a\n\ndifferent     one.\")       cf.   Bass,   180     F.3d    at    243     (holding   that\n\ninvoluntary commitment is not a function traditionally reserved\n\nexclusively to the state in Mississippi); Ellison, 48 F.3d at 196\n\n(same   in   Tennessee);         Rockwell,      26    F.3d    at   258-60    (same   in\n\nMassachusetts);       Harvey,     949    F.2d    at    1131    (same    in   Georgia);\n\nSpencer,     864    F.2d    at   1379-81     (same      in    Illinois).      Because\n\ninvoluntary commitment is a function that is and has been routinely\n\nperformed by private parties in Puerto Rico, Estades' public\n\nfunction argument as it relates to involuntary commitment fails.\n\n             2.    Provision of Medical and Psychiatric Services\n\n             Estades' argument that Appellees are state actors under\n\nthe public function test because they provided health services to\n\nindigents is similarly flawed. The provision of health services is\n\nnot and has never been the exclusive province of the state in\n\nPuerto Rico.       See 24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 7001 (noting that \"[f]rom the\n\nbeginning of th[e twentieth] century, Puerto Rico's public policy\n\n\n\ninitiate the involuntary commitment process by \"fil[ing] a petition\nin court,\" id. § 6002; before a court can rule on a petition, it\nmust possess \"a certificate [from] a psychiatrist\" attesting to the\nneed for commitment, id. § 6003; and if a petition is granted, the\nsubject of the petition is to be taken to any \"mental health\nfacility,\" id. § 6004; see id. § 4002(11).\n\n                                         -18-\n\fhas revolved around the attitude that the Government has the\n\nresponsibility   of   offering    direct   health   services\"   and   that\n\n\"[p]ursuant to such policy, two health systems have evolved,\" one\n\npublic and one private).    Thus, there can be no finding of state\n\naction under the public function test.\n\n                           III.   Conclusion\n\n          The district court's dismissal of Estades' federal action\n\nis affirmed.   We express no opinion as to whether the allegations\n\nin the complaint, if true, state a viable claim or viable claims\n\nunder Puerto Rico law.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\f",

Appellant Clara Estades-\n\nNegroni (\"Estades\") brought this action in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Puerto Rico against CPC Hospital\n\nSan Juan Capestrano (\"CPC Hospital\"), a private hospital, First\n\nOption    Corporation    Puerto    Rico    (\"First   Option\"),    a   private\n\nhealthcare   services    provider,    and    several   private    physicians\n\n(collectively, \"Appellees\") after she was involuntarily committed\n\nto CPC Hospital.    In her complaint, Estades alleged that Appellees\n\nwere liable under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 for violating her\n\nrights under the United States Constitution in connection with her\n\ncommitment. Estades also asserted that Appellees were liable under\n\nthe Constitution and laws of Puerto Rico.              Appellees moved the\n\ndistrict court to dismiss the federal claims pursuant to Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)1 on the ground that they are not\n\nstate actors and, therefore, are not subject to suit under § 1983.2\n\nThe   district   court   granted    the    motion,   declined    to   exercise\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims, and\n\nthen dismissed the action.           Estades now seeks review of the\n\ndistrict court's finding that Appellees are not state actors and\n\nthe resulting dismissal of her action.          We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      Rule 12(b)(6) provides for dismissal if there is a \"failure\nto state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\"\n      2\n      Estades' § 1988 claim is entirely dependent on the viability\nof her § 1983 claim.\n\n                                     -3-\n\f                            I.    Background\n\n            We recount and, for purposes of this appeal, accept as\n\ntrue the allegations in Estades' complaint.3         See Rockwell v. Cape\n\nCod Hosp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672033\"><a href=\"/opinion/672033/susan-rockwell-v-cape-cod-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 255 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n           In September 1996, Estades sought and began to receive\n\npsychiatric treatment from Doctor Luis E. Canepa (\"Canepa\"), an\n\nemployee and director of First Option, at the facilities of First\n\nOption.    Her treatment was provided pursuant to the Puerto Rico\n\nHealth Reform Plan (the \"Plan\"), which was enacted to ensure that\n\nmedically indigent residents of Puerto Rico receive quality medical\n\ncare.    See 24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 7001.\n\n           In accordance with the Plan, the Puerto Rico Health\n\nInsurance Administration (the \"Administration\"), an instrumentality\n\nof the government of Puerto Rico, was created to implement a health\n\ninsurance system for the medically indigent.             See id. §§ 7003-04.\n\nAs a means to fulfill its primary purpose, the Administration was\n\ngiven the authority to contract with private health insurance\n\ncarriers   to   arrange   for    the    provision   of    medical   care   to\n\n\n\n     3\n      Estades originally filed her complaint on April 30, 1999, but\nshe filed an amended complaint on September 10, 1999.           The\nallegations are taken from the amended complaint.        There are\nseveral instances where the complaint references, both directly and\nindirectly, statutes of Puerto Rico.       In those instances, we\nconsider, and cite to, those statutes. See Rodi v. S. New Eng.\nSch. of Law, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"In ruling on whether\na plaintiff has stated an actionable claim, an inquiring court . .\n. must consider the complaint . . . and other materials fairly\nincorporated within it.\").\n\n                                       -4-\n\findigents.4   See id. § 7026.     The carriers were then to hire\n\nmedical professionals, and it was these professionals who were to\n\nprovide the care.    Acting under the Plan, the Administration\n\ncontracted with Triple S, a private health insurance carrier, and\n\nTriple S, in turn, contracted with First Option and Canepa.5\n\n          Between September 1996 and April 1997, Canepa treated\n\nEstades on a regular basis.     He diagnosed her as suffering from\n\ndepression and prescribed for her a variety of medications.     In\n\nApril 1997, Estades' mental health worsened and Canepa began\n\ndiscussing her condition with her son, Leonardo Velazquez Estades\n\n(\"Velazquez\").\n\n          On May 4, 1997, after consulting with Canepa, Velazquez\n\nbrought Estades to CPC Hospital, rather than to his house, where\n\nEstades thought that he was taking her.      Upon arriving at CPC\n\nHospital, Estades expressed a desire to leave.    However, she was\n\nforcibly restrained, injected with medication, and placed in a\n\n\n     4\n      The responsibilities of the Administration are carried out by\nits board of directors, which consists of seven individuals. See\n24 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 7004-05. The complaint alleges that Canepa\nwas \"the Administrator of the Plan's mental health services\nnetwork.\" Neither the complaint nor the parties' briefs expand on\nthe responsibilities that Canepa would have had as \"Administrator\nof the Plan's mental health services network.\" In any event, the\ncomplaint does not allege that Canepa was one of the members of the\nAdministration's board of directors, and therefore, we assume that\nhe was not.\n     5\n      Because the complaint alleges that Triple S contracted with\nboth First Option and Canepa, we assume that it did. See Rockwell,\n26 F.3d at 255. However, we doubt that Triple S was in a direct\ncontractual relationship with Canepa, an employee of First Option.\n\n                                -5-\n\fsecluded room.        That same day, Canepa sent a letter to CPC Hospital\n\nin which he assured the Hospital that it would soon receive written\n\nauthorization for Estades' commitment.\n\n            Velazquez, acting pursuant to Puerto Rico Law 116 (\"Law\n\n116\"), 24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 6001 et seq., then filed a petition with\n\nthe Court of First Instance for San Juan, Puerto Rico, the local\n\ntrial court, requesting that it authorize Estades' involuntary\n\nhospitalization.        See id. § 6002.        In Puerto Rico, an individual\n\ncan be involuntarily committed only pursuant to a court order. See\n\nid. § 6004.      One or more Appellees also filed documents with the\n\nCourt of First Instance in support of Velazquez's petition.               See\n\nid. § 6003.\n\n            Estades remained involuntarily committed at CPC Hospital\n\nfor a period of nineteen days.6          During that time, she alleges that\n\nshe   was   secluded     from   other    patients,   physically    restrained,\n\ninjected with medication against her will, physically assaulted by\n\nan    employee   of    CPC   Hospital,    and   physically   and   emotionally\n\nmistreated by other Hospital employees. At the end of the nineteen\n\ndays, and as a condition of her discharge, Estades claims that she\n\nwas coerced into agreeing that her commitment had been voluntary.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      We assume that the Court of First Instance granted\nVelazquez's petition. However, the complaint is silent on this\ntopic.    Nevertheless, whether the Court of First Instance\nultimately granted the petition does not affect our inquiry into\nwhether Appellees are subject to suit under § 1983.\n\n                                         -6-\n\f             Following her discharge, Estades brought this action\n\nagainst First Option, Canepa, CPC Hospital, and a number of private\n\nphysicians who had interacted with her during her hospitalization.\n\nIn the complaint, Estades asserted federal and state causes of\n\naction, including a § 1983 claim, against each Appellee.           The\n\nfederal counts were dependent on the viability of the § 1983 claim.\n\nOn Appellees' motion, the district court dismissed the federal\n\ncounts, based on its finding that Estades had failed to allege\n\nsufficient facts to establish that Appellees were state actors and,\n\nthus, subject to suit under § 1983.     The district court determined\n\nthat Estades could not show state action under any of the following\n\nthree tests we have employed to decide whether a private party\n\nshould be treated as a state actor:     the state compulsion test, the\n\nnexus/joint action test, and the public function test.            Then,\n\nacting pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3),7 the district court\n\nrefused to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining\n\nstate law claims and, consequently, dismissed the entire action.8\n\n             Estades appeals the dismissal of her § 1983 claim and the\n\nresulting dismissal of her § 1988 claim and state law claims.        Of\n\ncourse, if the § 1983 claim was subject to dismissal, then the\n\n\n\n     7\n      Section 1367(c) provides that a \"district court[] may decline\nto exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim . . . if . . .\n(3) [it] has dismissed all claims over which it has original\njurisdiction . . . .\"\n     8\n         The state law claims were dismissed without prejudice.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fdistrict court had the authority to dismiss the § 1988 claim, as\n\nwell as the state law claims.       See § 1367(c)(3).   Therefore, we\n\nmust decide whether the district court erred in dismissing the §\n\n1983 claim.\n\n                            II.

State Compulsion Test\n\n          Here, there can be no finding of state action under the\n\nstate compulsion test, as Estades failed to allege facts that would\n\nsupport a finding that the state coerced or encouraged Appellees to\n\npursue or otherwise participate in her involuntary commitment.     To\n\nbe sure, Estades alleged that Appellees acted in accordance with\n\nthe procedures outlined in the state statutory scheme established\n\nto govern involuntary commitment.      See 24 P.R.

But,\nneither that statement nor the assertion in Estades' brief that\nAppellees \"were employed by the [state]\" can be squared with the\nfacts alleged or statutes fairly referenced in the complaint.

Public Function Test\n\n              Having found no state action under the above two tests,\n\nwe turn to the last of the three tests:         the public function test.\n\nAs has been said, there can be state action under this test only if\n\nAppellees performed a public function that was \"traditionally the\n\n\n\n\nin question occurred within a private hospital and, in theory,\nEstades was free to seek treatment from physicians other than those\nassociated with the Plan.\n\n                                     -16-\n\fexclusive prerogative of the State.\"         Blum, 457 U.S. at 1005.16    In\n\nher complaint, and on appeal, Estades makes two public function\n\narguments:        first, she alleges that Appellees, \"in causing [her]\n\ninvoluntary commitment,\" performed a public function; and, second,\n\nshe asserts that Appellees \"performed the public function of\n\nproviding    free     medical   and   psychiatric   services   to   indigent\"\n\npersons.     We now address the two arguments, beginning with the\n\ninvoluntary commitment argument.\n\n             1.    Involuntary Commitment\n\n             There can be no finding of state action under the public\n\nfunction test in connection with Estades' involuntary commitment.\n\nThis is because involuntary commitment is not a function that is or\n\nhas been reserved exclusively to the state in Puerto Rico, and\n\ntherefore, Appellees, in pursuing or otherwise participating in\n\nEstades' commitment, could not have performed a public function\n\nwithin the meaning of this test.         See P.R. Laws Ann. § 6001 et seq.\n\n(indicating that private parties have been intimately involved in\n\nthe involuntary commitment process in Puerto Rico since 1980)17; see\n\n\n     16\n      The few activities that have been found to satisfy this\ndemanding standard include \"the administration of elections, the\noperation of a company town, eminent domain, peremptory challenges\nin jury selection, and, in at least limited circumstances, the\noperation of a municipal park.\" Perkins, 196 F.3d at 19 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). \"When a plaintiff ventures [beyond this\nshort list of activities], she has an uphill climb.\" Id.\n     17\n      For example, the statutory scheme governing involuntary\ncommitment in Puerto Rico since 1980, 24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 6001 et\nseq., provides that:    \"any person 18 years old or over\" may\n\n                                      -17-\n\falso Jackson v. Metro.

Bass,   180     F.3d    at    243     (holding   that\n\ninvoluntary commitment is not a function traditionally reserved\n\nexclusively to the state in Mississippi); Ellison, 48 F.3d at 196\n\n(same   in   Tennessee);         Rockwell,      26    F.3d    at   258-60    (same   in\n\nMassachusetts);       Harvey,     949    F.2d    at    1131    (same    in   Georgia);\n\nSpencer,     864    F.2d    at   1379-81     (same      in    Illinois).      Because\n\ninvoluntary commitment is a function that is and has been routinely\n\nperformed by private parties in Puerto Rico, Estades' public\n\nfunction argument as it relates to involuntary commitment fails.\n\n             2.    Provision of Medical and Psychiatric Services\n\n             Estades' argument that Appellees are state actors under\n\nthe public function test because they provided health services to\n\nindigents is similarly flawed. The provision of health services is\n\nnot and has never been the exclusive province of the state in\n\nPuerto Rico.       See 24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 7001 (noting that \"[f]rom the\n\nbeginning of th[e twentieth] century, Puerto Rico's public policy\n\n\n\ninitiate the involuntary commitment process by \"fil[ing] a petition\nin court,\" id. § 6002; before a court can rule on a petition, it\nmust possess \"a certificate [from] a psychiatrist\" attesting to the\nneed for commitment, id. § 6003; and if a petition is granted, the\nsubject of the petition is to be taken to any \"mental health\nfacility,\" id. § 6004; see id. § 4002(11).\n\n                                         -18-\n\fhas revolved around the attitude that the Government has the\n\nresponsibility   of   offering    direct   health   services\"   and   that\n\n\"[p]ursuant to such policy, two health systems have evolved,\" one\n\npublic and one private).    Thus, there can be no finding of state\n\naction under the public function test.\n\n                           III.
