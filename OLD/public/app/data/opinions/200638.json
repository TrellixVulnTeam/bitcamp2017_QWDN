In this appeal, we revisit a\n\ncontempt sanction imposed by the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico.           By way of prelusion, we offer here\n\nonly a sketch of antecedent events.                The reader who hungers for\n\nmore intimate familiarity with the facts should consult our last\n\nprevious opinion in this matter.               See Goya Foods, Inc. v. Wallack\n\nMgmt. Co., 290 F.3d 63, 67-70 (1st Cir. 2002) (Goya I) (cataloguing\n\nother reported cases and summarizing the thirty-year history of\n\nthis seemingly interminable intrafamilial dispute).\n\n            The tale began in 1969, when Charles Unanue was ousted\n\nfrom the family business, Goya Foods, Inc. (Goya).                          He later\n\naccepted a settlement of $4,400,000 in exchange, inter alia, for\n\nhis promise that he would neither contest his father's will nor\n\nfile   a   claim    against   his    father's      estate.      When   the    family\n\npatriarch died, however, Charles broke this promise.                   The contest\n\nthat he mounted in 1976 boomeranged: after prolonged litigation in\n\nthe New Jersey state courts, Goya obtained a judgment against him\n\nin the approximate amount of $6,900,000.\n\n            Charles    Unanue     then    contrived      a    series   of    gambits\n\ndesigned    to     shield   his     assets      from   this   judgment.        These\n\nmachinations included a sham bankruptcy, numerous attempts to\n\nconceal assets, and the creation of a fictitious investor.                      Even\n\nwhile interest was accruing on the New Jersey judgment, Goya\n\npersisted in its efforts to enforce that judgment.                 It eventually\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fsued Charles Unanue and his wife, Liliane, in Puerto Rico's federal\n\ndistrict court, seeking to reach and apply an assortment of assets\n\nthat had been placed in Liliane's name.                        In 1995, the district\n\ncourt issued a provisional order prohibiting the alienation of\n\nthese     holdings       (including   Liliane's        shares         in    a   luxurious\n\ncooperative      apartment       complex    located       at    625    Park     Avenue   in\n\nManhattan).\n\n              Goya promptly notified respondent-appellant 625 Park\n\nCorp.     and    respondent-appellant            Wallack       Management       Co.    (the\n\nbuilding's       owner     and   managing        agent,    respectively)          of     the\n\nprovisional order.         In 1997, the court entered judgment in Goya's\n\nfavor but stayed execution of the judgment pending appellate\n\nreview.       Goya Foods, Inc. v. Unanue-Casal, 982 F. Supp. 103, 112\n\n(D.P.R. 1997).           Goya notified the corporate appellants of the\n\ndistrict court's decision and requested that it be told before any\n\ndisposition was made of the Unanues' interest in the apartment.\n\n              The notices went unheeded.             On June 19, 1998, Liliane\n\nsold    the     cooperative      shares     (and,    thus,       the       apartment)     to\n\nrespondent-appellant          Ira   Leon     Rennert       for    $4,600,000.            The\n\nappellants acted in concert: Rennert closed despite knowing of the\n\nprovisional order and the ensuing district court decision, and both\n\nWallack Management and 625 Park took steps to facilitate the\n\ntransaction.       Liliane and Charles lost little time in absconding\n\nwith the net proceeds.\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f               Goya did not learn of the sale until October of 2000.            It\n\nquickly asked       the    district    court   for    assistance.     The   court\n\ndissolved the stay of execution.1 It thereafter held the appellants\n\nin    civil    contempt,    imposing     a   joint   and   several   sanction    of\n\napproximately $6,000,000 (comprising $4,600,000 on account of the\n\nsale price and roughly $1,400,000 in prejudgment interest).                   Goya\n\nFoods, Inc. v. Unanue-Casal, 141 F. Supp. 2d 207, 224 (D.P.R.\n\n2001), supplemented by Goya Foods, Inc. v. Unanue-Casal, Civ. No.\n\n95-2411, slip op. (D.P.R. Oct. 5, 2001) (unpublished). We affirmed\n\nthe finding of contempt but vacated the award because the district\n\ncourt had considered itself bound to follow 32 P.R. Laws Ann. App.\n\nIII, R. 44.3, and, thus, erroneously had deemed Goya entitled to\n\nprejudgment interest as a matter of law.               Goya I, 290 F.3d at 79-\n\n80.        We explained that \"when a federal district court sits in\n\ndiversity jurisdiction, its inherent power to impose monetary\n\nsanctions for contumacious conduct during the course of litigation\n\nis    not    circumscribed    by   the   forum   state's    law   regarding     the\n\nimposition of sanctions.\"          Id. at 80.        To correct this error, we\n\nremanded for reconsideration of the amount of the sanction, making\n\nclear that the lower court's options ranged from including no\n\nprejudgment interest component in the sanction to including any\n\nreasonable amount as a proxy for the time value of money.                Id.    If\n\n\n       1\n      On November 28, 2000 — a few weeks after Goya sought the\ndistrict court's intervention — we affirmed the 1997 judgment. See\nGoya Foods, Inc. v. Unanue, 233 F.3d 38, 48 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                                         -4-\n\fthe district court elected to follow the latter course, it was free\n\nto \"draw[] upon any reasonable statutory benchmark (state or\n\nfederal) to set an appropriate rate.\"              Id. at 79 n.9.\n\n           On remand, the district court noted the breadth of its\n\ninherent authority, concluded that the sanction should include a\n\nprejudgment interest component, and stated with little ceremony\n\nthat \"taking into consideration the idiosyncrasies of this case,\"\n\nPuerto   Rico's     statutory   interest      rate       (10.5%)   constituted   an\n\nappropriate measure.       Goya Foods, Inc. v. Unanue-Casal, Civ. No.\n\n95-2411, slip op. at 2 (D.P.R. Sept. 25, 2002) (unpublished).                    On\n\nthis basis, the court reimposed the original $6,000,000 sanction,\n\nwhich    included    a    $1,400,000    prejudgment          interest   component\n\nrepresenting simple interest at the rate of 10.5% per annum on the\n\nsale price of the cooperative shares for the period from June 19,\n\n1998 (the date when the sale occurred) to May 11, 2001 (the date\n\nwhen Rennert deposited an amount equal to the sale price in the\n\nregistry of the district court).             This appeal ensued.\n\n           The appellants complain variously that (1) the district\n\ncourt should have made specific findings as to whether and to what\n\nextent Goya suffered an actual loss, above and beyond the sale\n\nprice of the cooperative shares, deriving from their contumacious\n\nconduct;    (2)     the   court's   use       of     a    10.5%    interest   rate\n\novercompensated Goya; and (3) in all events, the court should not\n\nhave included prejudgment interest for the period between the date\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fof sale and the date on which we affirmed the right to levy on\n\nassets standing in Liliane Unanue's name, see supra note 1.          As we\n\nshall explain, these arguments are unavailing (and, for the most\n\npart, misguided).\n\n           We review a trial court's decision as to the amount of a\n\nmonetary sanction only for abuse of discretion. Chambers v. NASCO,\n\nInc., 501 U.S. 32, 55 (1991); Goya I, 290 F.3d at 77-78; Johnson v.\n\nA.W. Chesterton Co., 18 F.3d 1362, 1366 (7th Cir. 1994).           This is\n\na deferential standard, and a party who seeks to overturn a\n\nmonetary sanction on grounds of excessiveness bears a heavy burden.\n\nSee Jones v. Winnepesaukee Realty, 990 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1993);\n\nsee also Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co., 900 F.2d 388, 394 (1st\n\nCir.   1990)   (explaining   that   \"the    imposition   of   sanctions   is\n\nessentially a judgment call, and as such, seems best left to the\n\njudicial officer most familiar with the case\") (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).         Of course, trial courts do not\n\nhave unbridled license to pluck dollar figures out of thin air and\n\nincorporate them in sanctions.       See Roadway Exp., Inc. v. Piper,\n\n447 U.S. 752, 764-65 (1980); Navarro-Ayala v. Nunez, 968 F.2d 1421,\n\n1426-27 (1st Cir. 1992).        But mathematical exactitude is not\n\nrequired: so long as a sanction is reasonably proportionate to the\n\noffending conduct, the trial court's quantification of it ought not\n\nto be disturbed.    United States v. United Mine Workers, 330 U.S.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f258, 303 (1947); Long v. Steepro, 213 F.3d 983, 986 (7th Cir.\n\n2000); Navarro-Ayala, 968 F.2d at 1426-27.\n\n              In this case, the lower court acted well within the scope\n\nof its authority. Contrary to the appellants' importunings, it was\n\nnot necessary either for Goya to prove the actual time value of the\n\nwrongfully     withheld    funds   or   for   the   court   to   make    specific\n\nfindings derived from admissible evidence.                It suffices if, on\n\nwhole-record review, the sanction appears reasonable in amount and\n\nthe rationale behind it is evident.           Foval v. First Nat'l Bank of\n\nCommerce, 841 F.2d 126, 130 (5th Cir. 1988).\n\n              The sanction in this case easily passes through that\n\nscreen.     The first time around, the district court made pellucid\n\nthe   basis    for   the   sanction,    the   algorithm     by   which    it   had\n\ncalculated the amount, and the reasoning that drove the decision.\n\nWe approved the sanction in every particular save only the court's\n\nerroneous assumption that it was bound by Puerto Rico law to\n\ninclude a prejudgment interest component.            Goya I, 290 F.3d at 77-\n\n79. The second time around, nothing changed except that the court,\n\nfreed from the imagined constraints of its earlier assumption,\n\nelected as a matter of discretion to include a prejudgment interest\n\ncomponent in the overall sanction and to peg that component to the\n\nstatutory interest rate prescribed by local law. The basis for the\n\ncourt's action was crystal clear; more specific findings were not\n\nrequired.\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f          The appellants' second argument need not detain us.\n\nTheir determined assault on the district court's appointed interest\n\nrate is little more than whistling past the graveyard. In essence,\n\nthey claim that the 10.5% rate yields more interest than Goya\n\nconceivably could have earned, considering the performance in the\n\nrelevant time frame of the New York Stock Exchange, the Manhattan\n\nreal estate market, treasury bills, and the like.          But this appeal\n\nrevolves around   the    propriety   of   a    sanction,   not   around   the\n\npinpoint accuracy of an award for economic loss.             Goya's actual\n\nloss is not the issue.    We explain briefly.\n\n          In crafting a monetary sanction, a court must bear in\n\nmind not only the factual circumstances of the particular case but\n\nalso the purpose for imposing the sanction in the first place.            See\n\nNavarro-Ayala, 968 F.2d at 1426-27 (collecting cases); Willy v.\n\nCoastal Corp., 915 F.2d 965, 968 (5th Cir. 1990).                Because one\n\npurpose behind such a sanction is to compensate the aggrieved party\n\nfor harm suffered in consequence of the sanctioned party's acts,\n\nUnited Mine Workers, 330 U.S. at 304, the sanction \"must bear a\n\nreasonable relationship to the actual losses sustained by the\n\ninjured party.\"   Goya I, 290 F.3d at 78.            This does not mean,\n\nhowever, that compensation is the only factor the ordering court\n\ncan consider.   The opposite is true.         Chambers, 501 U.S. at 53-54\n\n& n.15; Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 691 n.17 (1978).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f               Sanctions stem, in part, from a need to regulate conduct\n\nduring litigation.       Chambers, 501 U.S. at 53.      Thus, a sanction may\n\nproperly have a punitive aspect.            See id.   Similarly, deterrence\n\nmay be considered in fixing the amount of a monetary sanction.             See\n\nUnited Mine Workers, 330 U.S. at 303; Jones, 990 F.2d at 6.               Given\n\nthese multiple purposes, a monetary sanction need not be perfectly\n\ncommensurate, dollar for dollar, with the aggrieved party's actual\n\nloss.       See United States v. Kouri-Perez, 187 F.3d 1, 6 n.2, 10 (1st\n\nCir. 1999); United States v. Marquardo, 149 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir.\n\n1998); see also Media Duplic. Servs., Ltd. v. HDG Software, Inc.,\n\n928 F.2d 1228, 1242 (1st Cir. 1991) (applying this principle to\n\nRule 16(f) sanctions).\n\n               In this case, we previously ruled that the district court\n\nhad discretion to include a prejudgment interest component in the\n\nmonetary sanction.          Goya I, 290 F.3d at 80.    We now hold that the\n\ncourt acted within the realm of its discretion in settling upon the\n\nstatutory 10.5% rate as a basis for calculating that component.\n\nFor one thing, the appellants' contumacious             conduct rendered it\n\nimpossible to determine with certainty what rate of return Goya\n\nwould have earned on the sale proceeds.            In fairness, then, doubts\n\nought to be resolved against the contemnors.             With that in mind,\n\nthe   statutory      rate    represented    an   equitable   estimate.2     See\n\n\n        2\n      Indeed, our earlier opinion invited the district court, if it\ndecided to include an interest component, to \"draw[] upon any\nreasonable statutory benchmark (state or federal)\" in choosing an\n\n                                      -9-\n\fCottrill v. Sparrow, Johnson & Ursillo, Inc., 100 F.3d 220, 225\n\n(1st Cir. 1996) (noting that a statutory interest rate \"is an\n\nobjective measure of the value of money over time\").   For another\n\nthing, the appellants' conduct was egregious, see Goya I, 290 F.3d\n\nat 75-77, and the district court reasonably could have believed\n\nthat punishment and the need to deter others called for generosity.\n\nSee Chambers, 501 U.S. at 56-57; Fox v. Acadia State Bank, 937 F.2d\n\n1566, 1571 (11th Cir. 1991) (per curiam).\n\n          The appellants' final argument also lacks force.     The\n\nrecord reveals an adequate basis for the district court's decision\n\nto start the interest accrual clock on the date of the sale rather\n\nthan on the date that we affirmed the reach-and-apply judgment.\n\nThe appellants committed the contempt at the moment that Rennert\n\npurchased the cooperative shares.     Had they first notified the\n\ndistrict court, the court would have been able to protect Goya's\n\ninterests by, say, blocking the sale altogether (thus securing for\n\nthe putative creditor the future appreciation in the value of the\n\napartment) or ordering the sale proceeds deposited in the registry\n\nof the court (thus earning interest from that time forward). Given\n\nthese realities, the appellants cannot now be heard to complain\n\nabout the court's decision to treat the closing date as the\n\nstarting point for the accrual of interest.\n\n\n\n\ninterest rate.   Goya I, 290 F.3d at 79 n.9.\n\n                               -10-\n\f            We need go no further.   A trial court's power to assert\n\nits authority over a contemnor is broad.   When the court orders the\n\ncontemnor to purge the contempt by paying a monetary sanction, a\n\nreviewing court must tread lightly.    Chambers, 501 U.S. at 55.   In\n\nthis case, the court below fashioned a condign sanction that was in\n\nreasonable proportion to the facts before it.     The sanction must,\n\ntherefore, stand.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

It eventually sued Charles Unanue and his wife, Liliane, in Puerto Rico's federal district court, seeking to reach and apply an assortment of assets that had been placed in Liliane's name.

As we shall explain, these arguments are unavailing (and, for the most part, misguided).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a trial court's decision as to the amount of a monetary sanction only for abuse of discretion. <i>Chambers v. NASCO, Inc.,</i> 501 U.S. 32, 55, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991); <i>Goya I,</i> 290 F.3d at 77-78; <i>Johnson v. A.W. Chesterton Co.,</i> 18 F.3d 1362, 1366 (7th Cir.1994). This is a deferential standard, and a party who seeks to overturn a monetary sanction on grounds of excessiveness bears a heavy burden. <i>See Jones v. Winnepesaukee Realty,</i> 990 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1993); <i>see also Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co.,</i> 900 F.2d 388, 394 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that \"the imposition of sanctions is essentially a judgment call, and as such, seems best left to the judicial officer most familiar with the case\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Of course, trial courts do not have unbridled license to pluck dollar figures out of thin air and incorporate them in sanctions. <i>See Roadway Exp., Inc. v. Piper,</i> 447 U.S. 752, 764-65, 100 S.Ct. 2455, 65 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980); <i>Navarro-Ayala v. Nunez,</i> 968 F.2d 1421, 1426-27 (1st Cir.1992). But mathematical exactitude is not required: so long as a sanction is reasonably proportionate to the offending conduct, the trial court's quantification of it ought not to be disturbed. <i>United States v. United Mine Workers,</i> 330 U.S. 258, 303, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947); <i>Long v. Steepro,</i> 213 F.3d 983, 986 (7th Cir.2000); <i>Navarro-Ayala,</i> 968 F.2d at 1426-27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the lower court acted well within the scope of its authority. Contrary to the appellants' importunings, it was not necessary either for Goya to prove the <i>actual</i> time value of the wrongfully withheld funds or for the court to make specific findings derived from admissible evidence. It suffices if, on whole-record review, the sanction appears reasonable in amount and the rationale behind it is evident. <i>Foval v. First Nat'l Bank of Commerce,</i> 841 F.2d 126, 130 (5th Cir. 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sanction in this case easily passes through that screen. The first time around, the district court made pellucid the basis for the sanction, the algorithm by which it had calculated the amount, and the reasoning that drove the decision. We approved the sanction in every particular save only the court's erroneous assumption that it was bound by Puerto Rico law to include a prejudgment interest component. <i>Goya I,</i> 290 F.3d at 77-79. The second time around, nothing changed except that the court, freed from the imagined constraints of its earlier assumption, elected as a matter of discretion to include a prejudgment interest component in the overall sanction and to peg that component to the statutory interest rate prescribed by local law. The basis for the court's action was crystal clear; more specific findings were not required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' second argument need not detain us. Their determined assault on the district court's appointed interest rate is little more than whistling past the graveyard. In essence, they claim that the 10.5% rate yields more interest than Goya conceivably could have earned, considering the performance in the relevant time frame of the New York Stock Exchange, the Manhattan real estate market, treasury bills, and the like. But this appeal revolves around the propriety of a sanction, not around the pinpoint accuracy of an award for economic loss. Goya's actual loss is not the issue. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In crafting a monetary sanction, a court must bear in mind not only the factual circumstances of the particular case but also the purpose for imposing the sanction in the first place. <i>See Navarro-Ayala,</i> 968 F.2d at 1426-27 (collecting cases); <i>Willy v. Coastal Corp.,</i> 915 F.2d 965, 968 (5th Cir.1990). Because one purpose behind such a sanction is to compensate the aggrieved party for harm suffered in consequence of the sanctioned party's acts, <i>United Mine Workers,</i> 330 U.S. at 304, 67 S.Ct. 677, the sanction \"must bear a reasonable relationship to the actual losses sustained by the injured party.\" <i>Goya I,</i> 290 F.3d at 78. This does not mean, however, that compensation is the <i>only</i> factor the ordering court can consider. The opposite is true. <i>Chambers,</i> 501 U.S. at 53-54 &amp; n. 15, 111 S.Ct. 2123; <i>Hutto v. Finney,</i> 437 U.S. 678, 691 n. 17, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanctions stem, in part, from a need to regulate conduct during litigation. <i>Chambers,</i> 501 U.S. at 53, 111 S.Ct. 2123. Thus, a sanction may properly have a punitive aspect. <i>See id.</i> Similarly, deterrence may be considered in fixing the amount of a monetary sanction. <i>See United Mine Workers,</i> 330 U.S. at 303, 67 S.Ct. 677; <i>Jones,</i> 990 F.2d at 6. Given these multiple purposes, a monetary sanction need not be perfectly commensurate, dollar for dollar, with the aggrieved party's actual loss. <i>See United States v. Kouri-Perez,</i> 187 F.3d 1, 6 n. 2, 10 (1st Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Marquardo,</i> 149 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir.1998); <i>see also Media Duplic. Servs., Ltd. v. HDG Software, Inc.,</i> 928 F.2d 1228, 1242 (1st Cir.1991) (applying this principle to Rule 16(f) sanctions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we previously ruled that the district court had discretion to include a prejudgment interest component in the monetary sanction. <i>Goya I,</i> 290 F.3d at 80. We now hold that the court acted within the realm of its discretion in settling upon the statutory 10.5% rate as a basis for calculating that component. For one thing, the appellants' contumacious conduct rendered it impossible to determine with certainty what rate of return Goya would have earned on the sale proceeds. In fairness, then, doubts ought to be resolved against the contemnors. With that in mind, the statutory rate represented an equitable estimate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See Cottrill v. Sparrow, Johnson &amp; Ursillo, Inc.,</i> 100 F.3d 220, 225 (1st Cir.1996) (noting that a statutory interest rate \"is an objective measure of the value of money over time\"). For another thing, the appellants' conduct was egregious, <i>see Goya I,</i> 290 F.3d at 75-77, and the district court reasonably could have believed that punishment and the need to deter others called for generosity. <i>See Chambers,</i> 501 U.S. at 56-57, 111 S.Ct. 2123; <i>Fox v. Acadia State Bank,</i> 937 F.2d 1566, 1571 (11th Cir.1991) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' final argument also lacks force. The record reveals an adequate basis for the district court's decision to start the interest accrual clock on the date of the sale rather than on the date that we affirmed the reach-and-apply judgment. The appellants committed the contempt at the moment that Rennert purchased the cooperative shares. Had they first notified the district court, the court would have been able to protect Goya's interests by, say, blocking the sale altogether (thus securing for the putative creditor the future appreciation in the value of the apartment) or ordering the sale proceeds deposited in the registry of the court (thus earning interest from that time forward). Given these realities, the appellants cannot now be heard to complain about the court's decision to treat the closing date as the starting point for the accrual of interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. A trial court's power to assert its authority over a contemnor is broad. When the court orders the contemnor to purge the contempt by paying a monetary sanction, a reviewing court must tread lightly. <i>Chambers,</i> 501 U.S. at 55, 111 S.Ct. 2123. In this case, the court below fashioned a condign sanction that was in reasonable proportion to the facts before it. The sanction must, therefore, stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On November 28, 2000 &#8212; a few weeks after Goya sought the district court's intervention &#8212; we affirmed the 1997 judgment<i>See Goya Foods, Inc. v.

(Goya). He later accepted a settlement of $4,400,000 in exchange, inter alia, for his promise that he would neither contest his father's will nor file a claim against his father's estate.

Of course, trial courts do not have unbridled license to pluck dollar figures out of thin air and incorporate them in sanctions. <i>See Roadway Exp., Inc. v.

But mathematical exactitude is not required: so long as a sanction is reasonably proportionate to the offending conduct, the trial court's quantification of it ought not to be disturbed. <i>United States v.

Contrary to the appellants' importunings, it was not necessary either for Goya to prove the <i>actual</i> time value of the wrongfully withheld funds or for the court to make specific findings derived from admissible evidence. It suffices if, on whole-record review, the sanction appears reasonable in amount and the rationale behind it is evident. <i>Foval v. First Nat'l Bank of Commerce,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></span>, 130 (5th Cir. 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sanction in this case easily passes through that screen. The first time around, the district court made pellucid the basis for the sanction, the algorithm by which it had calculated the amount, and the reasoning that drove the decision. We approved the sanction in every particular save only the court's erroneous assumption that it was bound by Puerto Rico law to include a prejudgment interest component. <i>Goya I,</i> 290 F.3d at 77-79. The second time around, nothing changed except that the court, freed from the imagined constraints of its earlier assumption, elected as a matter of discretion to include a prejudgment interest component in the overall sanction and to peg that component to the statutory interest rate prescribed by local law. The basis for the court's action was crystal clear; more specific findings were not required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' second argument need not detain us. Their determined assault on the district court's appointed interest rate is little more than whistling past the graveyard. In essence, they claim that the 10.5% rate yields more interest than Goya conceivably could have earned, considering the performance in the relevant time frame of the New York Stock Exchange, the Manhattan real estate market, treasury bills, and the like. But this appeal revolves around the propriety of a sanction, not around the pinpoint accuracy of an award for economic loss. Goya's actual loss is not the issue. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In crafting a monetary sanction, a court must bear in mind not only the factual circumstances of the particular case but also the purpose for imposing the sanction in the first place. <i>See Navarro-Ayala,</i> 968 F.2d at 1426-27 (collecting cases); <i>Willy v. Coastal Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548957\"><a href=\"/opinion/548957/donald-j-willy-v-the-coastal-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span>, 968 (5th Cir.1990). Because one purpose behind such a sanction is to compensate the aggrieved party for harm suffered in consequence of the sanctioned party's acts, <i>United Mine Workers,</i> 330 U.S. at 304, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104385\"><a href=\"/opinion/104385/united-states-v-mine-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span>, the sanction \"must bear a reasonable relationship to the actual losses sustained by the injured party.\" <i>Goya I,</i> 290 F.3d at 78. This does not mean, however, that compensation is the <i>only</i> factor the ordering court can consider. The opposite is true. <i>Chambers,</i> 501 U.S. at 53-54 &amp; n. 15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112616\"><a href=\"/opinion/112616/chambers-v-nasco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, a sanction may properly have a punitive aspect. <i>See id.</i> Similarly, deterrence may be considered in fixing the amount of a monetary sanction. <i>See United Mine Workers,</i> 330 U.S. at 303, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104385\"><a href=\"/opinion/104385/united-states-v-mine-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We now hold that the court acted within the realm of its discretion in settling upon the statutory 10.5% rate as a basis for calculating that component. For one thing, the appellants' contumacious conduct rendered it impossible to determine with certainty what rate of return Goya would have earned on the sale proceeds. In fairness, then, doubts ought to be resolved against the contemnors. With that in mind, the statutory rate represented an equitable estimate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See Cottrill v. Sparrow, Johnson &amp; Ursillo, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197093\"><a href=\"/opinion/197093/cottrill-v-sparrow/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 225 (1st Cir.1996) (noting that a statutory interest rate \"is an objective measure of the value of money over time\"). For another thing, the appellants' conduct was egregious, <i>see Goya I,</i> 290 F.3d at 75-77, and the district court reasonably could have believed that punishment and the need to deter others called for generosity. <i>See Chambers,</i> 501 U.S. at 56-57, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112616\"><a href=\"/opinion/112616/chambers-v-nasco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The record reveals an adequate basis for the district court's decision to start the interest accrual clock on the date of the sale rather than on the date that we affirmed the reach-and-apply judgment. The appellants committed the contempt at the moment that Rennert purchased the cooperative shares. Had they first notified the district court, the court would have been able to protect Goya's interests by, say, blocking the sale altogether (thus securing for the putative creditor the future appreciation in the value of the apartment) or ordering the sale proceeds deposited in the registry of the court (thus earning interest from that time forward). Given these realities, the appellants cannot now be heard to complain about the court's decision to treat the closing date as the starting point for the accrual of interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. A trial court's power to assert its authority over a contemnor is broad. When the court orders the contemnor to purge the contempt by paying a monetary sanction, a reviewing court must tread lightly. <i>Chambers,</i> 501 U.S. at 55, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112616\"><a href=\"/opinion/112616/chambers-v-nasco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
