Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                      Howard, Circuit Judge,\n\n           Coffin and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Harvey Weiner with whom Barry D.

These cross-appeals arise out of\n\nan indemnification dispute between an employer and its insurer.\n\nThe principal issue is whether the employer must be indemnified for\n\ncertain   belated   contributions     it    made   to   the   profit-sharing\n\naccounts of various subsidiary employees.           Upon determining that\n\nthese payments (and certain other amounts) were covered by the\n\nrelevant policy, the district court granted the employer's motion\n\nfor summary judgment in the amount of $1,015,138.94 and denied the\n\ninsurer's cross-motion for summary judgment seeking a declaration\n\nof no coverage under the policy.           See Pacific Ins. Co. v. Eaton\n\nVance Mgmt., 260 F. Supp. 2d 236 (D. Mass. Aug. 14, 2002); Pacific\n\nIns. Co. v. Eaton Vance Mgmt., 260 F. Supp. 2d 334 (D. Mass. April\n\n30, 2003).     We reverse in part, vacate in part, and remand.\n\n                                    I.\n\n           The relevant facts having been twice reported, see id.,\n\nwe confine ourselves to the essentials.\n\n           A. The Plan\n\n           Since the 1950s, Eaton Vance Management (\"Eaton Vance\")1\n\nand its predecessors have operated a qualified profit-sharing plan\n\n(\"Plan\")2 for their employees.        Annual contributions to the Plan\n\n\n\n     1\n      Eaton Vance is a Massachusetts business trust, with its\nprincipal place of business in Boston.\n     2\n      The Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") reviewed the Plan and\ndeemed it \"qualified,\" with the result that Eaton Vance may deduct\nany contributions made to it.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fare discretionary and, if made, are derived from Eaton Vance's\n\nprofits in a given fiscal year.     Of particular importance are the\n\nPlan's employee-eligibility criteria.\n\n          Prior   to   November   1984,   employees   of   Eaton   Vance's\n\nsubsidiaries were not included in the Plan unless the respective\n\nsubsidiary expressly adopted the Plan by written resolution.3           In\n\nJuly 1986, Eaton Vance adopted new Plan documents –- effective\n\nNovember 1, 1984 (\"1984 documents\") –- that allegedly broadened the\n\nPlan's eligibility criteria to include automatically subsidiary\n\nemployees unless specifically excluded. Supplying our own emphasis\n\nto language that significantly differs from, or adds to, language\n\nin the prior governing documents, see supra n.3, the 1984 documents\n\nprovide in pertinent part:\n\n          The term employee includes: (a) any common-law\n          employee of the employer . . . .\n\n          \"Employer\" means the employer named in the\n          last section of the adoption agreement, any\n          commonly controlled organization, and any\n          predecessor organization . . . .\n\n          An employee ordinarily becomes an active\n          participant on his entry date. However, there\n          are three exceptions: . . . (c) An employee is\n          not an active participant during any period in\n          which he is not an employee in an eligible\n          class.\n\n\n     3\n      Specifically, the governing documents defined \"employee\" as\n\"any employee of the employer\" and defined \"employer\" as \"the\nemployer named in the Adoption Agreement\" (i.e., Eaton Vance) and\n\"any predecessor organization.\" The documents also provided that\n\"a commonly controlled organization may join the employer in\nadopting this plan . . . by [adopting] a written resolution.\"\n\n                                  -3-\n\f          An employee is in an eligible class unless:\n          [he falls within one of four exceptions not\n          germane to this appeal].\n\n          Subject to the rules of this article, a\n          commonly controlled organization may join the\n          principal employer [Eaton Vance] in adopting\n          this plan. A commonly controlled organization\n          with any employees eligible must join the\n          principal employer in adopting this plan. No\n          other organization may do so.\n\n          An   organization        joins      by      a        written\n          resolution . . . .\n\nIt is uncontested that, despite its adoption of the 1984 documents,\n\nEaton Vance management was unaware of the change in language.\n\n          Because   Eaton   Vance    did    not    intend       to   broaden   the\n\neligibility    criteria   (i.e.,    it    continued       to    believe   that   a\n\nsubsidiary's affirmative adoption of the Plan was a condition\n\nprecedent to the subsidiary's employees' eligibility), it continued\n\nto operate the Plan as it had prior to the adoption of the 1984\n\ndocuments and treated as participants only those employees of those\n\nsubsidiaries that had expressly adopted the Plan.                Accordingly, it\n\ndid not automatically establish accounts in the names of all\n\nsubsidiary employees.     Nor did it specifically exclude them from\n\nthe Plan or provide them with information regarding the Plan.\n\n          B.    The Claim Against Eaton Vance\n\n          On February 2, 1999, Wilfredo Hernandez, then an employee\n\nof an Eaton Vance subsidiary (Compass Management, Inc.), sent to\n\nEaton Vance a letter indicating that money due him under the Plan\n\nhad not been deposited into his account.                  Upon receiving this\n\n                                    -4-\n\fletter, Eaton Vance contacted its outside ERISA counsel for an\n\nevaluation of Hernandez's claim.            Although Compass had not adopted\n\nthe Plan by written resolution, outside counsel advised Eaton Vance\n\nthat, due to the plain language of the 1984 documents, Hernandez\n\nlikely would be successful if he chose to litigate.                        Further,\n\ncounsel      warned   Eaton   Vance    that     there    would    be   serious    tax\n\nconsequences if the IRS discovered that the Plan had not been\n\nadministered according to its terms.                    Eaton Vance thereafter\n\nadopted counsel's advice and has since steadfastly maintained –-\n\nboth before the district court and on appeal –- that the 1984\n\ndocuments were worded so as to cover Hernandez and other similarly\n\nsituated employees.\n\n              On   April    28,   1999,    outside      ERISA    counsel   sent   to\n\nHernandez's attorney a letter acknowledging that Eaton Vance should\n\nhave       recognized      Hernandez      and   other     \"similarly       affected\n\nparticipants\" as Plan participants.              The letter also stated that\n\nEaton Vance would fund those accounts at the level they would have\n\nbeen funded had the employees been recognized as participants all\n\nalong.4\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      In October 1999, Eaton Vance revised the plan language\n(effective November 1, 1998) to reaffirm its intention that\nemployees of subsidiaries are not included in the Plan unless the\nPlan has been adopted by written resolution of the subsidiary.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f              C. The Insurance Policy\n\n              Back in 1998, Pacific Insurance Company (\"Pacific\") had\n\nissued to Eaton Vance a Mutual Fund Errors and Omission Policy\n\n(\"Policy\") effective from August 1, 1997, to August 1, 1999.              The\n\nPolicy provided coverage for\n\n              [l]oss or liability incurred by [Eaton Vance],\n              from any claim made against [Eaton Vance]\n              during the Endorsement Period, by reason of\n              any actual or alleged failure to discharge his\n              or its duties or to act prudently within the\n              meaning of the Employee Retirement Income\n              Security Act of 1974 [\"ERISA\"] . . ., or by\n              reason of any actual or alleged breach of\n              fiduciary responsibility within the meaning of\n              said Act . . . in [Eaton Vance's] capacity as\n              a fiduciary with respect to any pension or\n              employee plan or trust.\n\n              D. The Notification & The Funding of Overdue Accounts\n\n              By letter dated June 18, 1999, Eaton Vance notified\n\nPacific of the Hernandez claim.         Pacific thereafter responded with\n\na    letter    acknowledging    receipt       of   Eaton   Vance's   letter.\n\nSubsequently, Eaton Vance asked Pacific to agree to a filing with\n\nthe IRS under the Voluntary Compliance Review (\"VCR\") program.\n\n(This filing had been proposed by outside ERISA counsel as a means\n\nto   end   Eaton   Vance's   exposure    to   governmental    penalties   for\n\nnoncompliance with the 1984 documents.)            Pacific acknowledged this\n\nrequest but \"before consenting to this action\" urged Eaton Vance to\n\nconsider withholding any additional contributions to the Plan.\n\nPacific further stated that it was \"reserv[ing] its rights\" and\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fadvised Eaton Vance \"to take whatever action [it] deems appropriate\n\nto protect Eaton Vance including the filing of a VCR application.\"\n\n            The   VCR   application    ultimately   was   filed   with,   and\n\napproved by, the IRS.      Although Hernandez had been the only party\n\nto make a claim under the Plan, Eaton Vance thereafter established\n\naccounts for a total of forty-nine employees and contributed\n\n$880,869.86 to those accounts (representing the amount -– principal\n\nand interest –- needed to fund the accounts to the level they would\n\nhave attained had Eaton Vance timely contributed).\n\n            E. The Litigation\n\n            On June 8, 2000, Pacific filed a diversity action in the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts seeking a declaratory judgment of no\n\ncoverage under the Policy.            See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332 and 2201.\n\nSpecifically, Pacific alleged, inter alia, that (1) Eaton Vance did\n\nnot breach its fiduciary duties or fail to discharge its duties or\n\nact prudently within the meaning of ERISA; (2) the obligation to\n\nmake payments is not due \"by reason of\" a breach of fiduciary\n\nresponsibility or \"by reason of\" a failure of Eaton Vance to\n\ndischarge its duties; and, (3) even if there is coverage under the\n\nPolicy, a $1,000 per claim deductible exists for each excluded\n\nemployee.    Eaton Vance counterclaimed, alleging that the Policy\n\ncovered its liabilities.         Eventually, both parties moved for\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f           On August 14, 2002, the district court entered summary\n\njudgment   for   Eaton   Vance   upon   determining,     inter   alia,   that\n\n(1) Eaton Vance had breached its fiduciary duty under ERISA; and\n\n(2) Eaton Vance's liability to the excluded employees was caused by\n\nthis breach.     See Pacific Ins. Co., 260 F. Supp. 2d at 241-44.        The\n\ncourt did find, however, that there existed a $1,000 deductible for\n\neach employee's claim; accordingly, it granted summary judgment to\n\nPacific on this issue.     See id. at 247-48.      Finally, on April 30,\n\n2003, Pacific was ordered to pay Eaton Vance $1,015,138.94.5             See\n\nPacific Ins. Co., 260 F. Supp. 2d at 346-47.\n\n           These cross-appeals followed.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           A.    Standards of Review\n\n           Summary    judgment    is     proper   when    \"the   pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.\"        Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).    In ruling\n\n\n     5\n      This amount was calculated as follows: $880,869.86 (the\namount –- principal and interest –- that Eaton Vance paid to fund\nthe employees' accounts) - $49,000 (the Policy's deductible) +\n$148,876.28 (the prejudgment interest on the $880,869.86) +\n$12,537.00 (the defense and investigation costs incurred prior to\nthe date on which Eaton Vance notified Pacific of Hernandez's\nclaim) + $5,787.16 (the prejudgment interest on the $12,537) +\n$13,100.57 (the prejudgment interest on the post-notification costs\nthat belatedly were reimbursed by Pacific) + $2,968.07 (the costs\nfor deposition transcripts).\n\n                                    -8-\n\fon the motion, the district court must view \"the facts in the light\n\nmost favorable to the non-moving party, drawing all reasonable\n\ninferences in that party's favor.\"     Barbour v. Dynamics Research\n\nCorp., 63 F.3d 32, 36 (1st Cir. 1995).      And, of course, \"[t]he\n\nstandards are the same where, as here, both parties have moved for\n\nsummary judgment.\" Bienkowski v. Northeastern Univ., 285 F.3d 138,\n\n140 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing 10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.\n\nMiller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2720, at\n\n335-36 (3d ed. 1998) (\"The court must rule on each party's motion\n\non an individual and separate basis, determining, for each side,\n\nwhether a judgment may be entered in accordance with the Rule 56\n\nstandard.\")).     The district court's rulings on the cross-motions\n\nfor summary judgment are reviewed de novo.     See Calero-Cerezo v.\n\nU.S. Dept. of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19 (1st Cir. 2004) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n            B.   Analysis\n\n            In order for Pacific to be held liable under the Policy,\n\nEaton Vance must have incurred a (1) \"loss or liability\" (2) \"by\n\nreason of\" (3) \"any actual or alleged failure to discharge . . .\n\nits duties or to act prudently within the meaning of . . .\n\nERISA . . . or by reason of any actual or alleged breach of\n\nfiduciary responsibility within the meaning of [ERISA].\"         As\n\nalready stated, the district court determined that coverage existed\n\nunder the Policy because each element was satisfied.        Without\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fnecessarily opining on whether the facts of this case implicate\n\neither the first or third prong, we turn directly to a discussion\n\nof the second.\n\n           \"[B]y   reason   of\"   is   not   defined   in   the   Policy;\n\naccordingly, if the language were ambiguous, we normally would\n\nconsider whether the phrase should be construed in favor of Eaton\n\nVance.   See Cody v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co., 439 N.E.2d 234, 237\n\n(Mass. 1982) (\"[I]f the contract is ambiguous, doubts as to the\n\nmeaning of the words must be resolved against the insurance company\n\nthat employed them and in favor of the insured.\" (citations and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted)); F.D.I.C. v. Ins. Co. of North\n\nAm., 105 F.3d 778, 786-87 (1st Cir. 1997) (applying Massachusetts\n\nlaw and noting that the presumption against the insurer does not\n\napply \"where the policy language results from the bargaining\n\nbetween sophisticated commercial parties of similar bargaining\n\npower\" (citation omitted)).\n\n           Here, however, we need not reach the contra proferentem\n\nissue because we consider the language unambiguous: \"by reason of\"\n\nmeans \"because of,\" Black's Law Dictionary 201 (6th ed. 1990), and\n\nthus necessitates an analysis at least approximating a \"but-for\"\n\ncausation test.    Cf. United States v. Rosa-Ortiz, 348 F.3d 33, 38\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (\"The statutory phrase 'by virtue of,' by its plain\n\nmeaning, suggests a but-for causation test.\" (citing Webster's\n\nThird New Int'l Dictionary 307 (defining \"by virtue of\" to mean \"by\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\freason of\"))); Three Sons, Inc. v. Phoenix Ins. Co., 257 N.E.2d\n\n774, 776 (Mass. 1970) (\"The words 'liability imposed . . . by\n\nreason of any statute,' clearly imports a direct causal relation\n\nbetween the fact of liability and the violation of a statute.   To\n\nqualify for this exclusion, liability must directly result from the\n\nviolation of the statute . . . .\" (emphases added)).   We therefore\n\nreject Eaton Vance's assertion that \"'by reason of' . . . is a more\n\ngenerous standard that extends coverage beyond the strict 'but-for'\n\ntest Pacific seems to be applying.\"6   See Cody, 439 N.E.2d at 237\n\n(\"A policy of insurance whose provisions are plainly and definitely\n\nexpressed in appropriate language must be enforced in accordance\n\nwith its terms.\" (citations and quotation marks omitted)).\n\n          Having defined the relevant language, we next consider\n\nwhether Eaton Vance's liability to the employees falls within the\n\nPolicy's scope.   Eaton Vance argues that, even under a restrictive\n\nreading of the Policy's causation element, coverage exists because\n\n(1) the cause of Eaton Vance's liability was \"its failure to\n\nadminister the Plan in accordance with the 1984 Plan Documents by\n\nidentifying the proper participants [i.e., Hernandez and other\n\nsimilarly situated employees] and establishing and funding accounts\n\nfor them when contributions were made\"; (2) \"this failure was a\n\n\n     6\n      The authorities that Eaton Vance cites for support (a\nTennessee Supreme Court case and a piece in an insurance journal)\nare not directly on point because they deal with construction of\nthe phrase \"arising out of\" rather than the \"by-reason-of\" language\nat issue here.\n\n                                -11-\n\fbreach of Eaton Vance's fiduciary obligations\"; and that (3)\n\n\"[o]nce [this breach] occurred, no intervention from any other\n\nforce was required to bring about the liability.\"    Presented with\n\na similar argument,7 the district court agreed with Eaton Vance:\n\n\"[The] failure to read the 1984 Plan Documents closely enough to\n\nsee that the scope of the Plan had changed was . . . a breach of\n\nfiduciary duty which resulted in Hernandez's account not being\n\nfunded.\"      Pacific Ins. Co., 260 F. Supp. 2d at 244 (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n             Having had the benefit of additional briefing and oral\n\nargument on this tricky issue, we arrive at a different conclusion.\n\nAs we see it, the relevant liability for which Eaton Vance seeks\n\nrecovery from its insurer is not one for breach of fiduciary duty\n\nrelative to the belatedly funded employee accounts; rather, Eaton\n\nVance seeks reimbursement for amounts it paid -– principal and\n\ninterest –- in satisfaction of its Plan-created obligation to\n\nestablish and fund those accounts to the level they would have\n\nattained had Eaton Vance initially complied with the Plan.       So\n\n\n\n     7\n         Specifically, Eaton Vance argued that\n\n     simply signing the 1984 Plan documents did not\n     proximately cause Hernandez's account to be unfunded[;]\n     [r]ather, the cause of Hernandez's unfunded account was\n     that Eaton Vance did not administer the Plan in\n     accordance with its terms, which is a breach of fiduciary\n     duty under ERISA that is covered by the Policy.\n\nPacific Ins. Co., 260 F. Supp. 2d at 243-44 (emphasis added).\n\n                                 -12-\n\funderstood, the cause of this obligation cannot be the breach of\n\nthe obligation; instead, in our view, this obligation derived from\n\nthe broadened eligibility criteria in the 1984 documents themselves\n\n(as now interpreted by Eaton Vance), management's discretionary\n\ndecision to fund, and the employees' concomitant entitlement to\n\ninterest that would have accrued in their profit-sharing accounts\n\nhad Eaton Vance acted in accordance with the Plan by establishing\n\nand funding the accounts.8     See, e.g., American Cas. Co. of\n\n\n     8\n      The interest at issue here is, essentially, the prejudgment\ninterest that a court might have awarded Hernandez and others had\nthey elected to litigate their claims for payment of benefits due\nunder the Plan. Cf. Cottrill v. Sparrow, Johnson & Ursillo, Inc.,\n100 F.3d 220, 223-24 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"In ERISA cases the district\ncourt may grant prejudgment interest in its discretion to\nprevailing fiduciaries, beneficiaries, or plan participants. . . .\nOrdinarily a cause of action under ERISA and prejudgment interest\non a plan participant's claim both accrue when a fiduciary denies\na participant's benefits. . . . Setting the accrual date in this\nmanner not only advances the general purposes of prejudgment\ninterest . . . but also serves ERISA's remedial objectives by\nmaking a participant whole for the period during which the\nfiduciary withholds money legally due. . . . Figuring the accrual\ndate in this way also prevents unjust enrichment.\" (citations\nomitted)). Accordingly, as we see it, the interest portion of the\n$880,869.86 is part and parcel of what is due the employees under\nthe Plan and, as such, is not a liability incurred by reason of a\nbreach of fiduciary duty.\n     The result we reach makes sense from a policy perspective as\nwell. Because Eaton Vance wrongfully withheld the principal, it\npresumably was able to earn interest on these monies –- interest\nthat otherwise would have been earned by the employees on their\naccounts. As such, the interest represents benefits to Eaton Vance\non monies wrongfully withheld. If we were to hold that the Policy\ncovers these amounts, Eaton Vance would reap a substantial\nwindfall.    This result would create a perverse incentive for\nemployers negligently to delay contributions while retaining the\nmonies in an interest-earning account safe in the belief that any\ninterest earned would be theirs to keep.\n     In any event, Eaton Vance made no significant effort –- either\n\n                               -13-\n\fReading, Pa. v. Hotel & Rest. Employees & Bartenders Int'l Union\n\nWelfare Fund, 942 P.2d 172, 176-77 (Nev. 1997) (\"The refusal to pay\n\nan obligation simply is not the cause of the obligation, and the\n\n[insured's] wrongful act in this case did not result in their\n\nobligation to pay; [its] contract imposed on [it] the obligation to\n\npay.\").\n\n           Whether or not Eaton Vance breached its fiduciary duties\n\nunder ERISA by initially failing to administer the Plan in timely\n\naccordance with its terms is thus of no import to the relevant\n\ncausation inquiry because the underlying obligation for which\n\nreimbursement is sought existed regardless of whether Eaton Vance\n\nfirst   complied    with   its   fiduciary   duties   or   breached   them.\n\nAccordingly, we must also reject Eaton Vance's alternative argument\n\nthat the asserted breach of fiduciary duty was a concurrent cause\n\nof the obligation.    See 7 G. Couch, Couch on Insurance § 101:57 (3d\n\ned. 1997) (\"The concurrent cause rule . . . takes the approach that\n\ncoverage   should    be    allowed   whenever   two   or   more   causes   do\n\nappreciably contribute to the loss, and at least one of the causes\n\nis an included risk under the policy.\").\n\n\n\n\nbefore us or before the district court –- to argue that, even if\nthe principal payments are not covered under the Policy, the\ninterest should be covered. Cf. United States v. Zannino, 895\nF.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[W]e see no reason to abandon the\nsettled appellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory\nmanner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,\nare deemed waived.\").\n\n                                     -14-\n\f             As we understand the situation, the difference between\n\nwhat did happen (the belated funding of the accounts) and what\n\nshould have happened (the timely funding of the accounts) is only\n\none of timing: because Eaton Vance's management failed to read the\n\n1984 documents prior to receiving the Hernandez letter, management\n\nbecame aware of the company's liability to the accounts later than\n\nit otherwise would have.      Eaton Vance essentially argues this same\n\npoint   in   its   brief:   \"Had   Eaton   Vance   administered   the   Plan\n\naccording to its terms during each affected year, the omitted\n\nparticipants would have had funded accounts at the time they came\n\nto seek benefits.\"\n\n             But the fact that the alleged breach of fiduciary duty\n\nresulted in the late payment of funds does not alter the essential\n\nfact that the liability was \"incurred . . . by reason of\" the\n\nadoption of the 1984 documents, management's discretionary decision\n\nto fund the accounts of eligible employees, and the employees'\n\nentitlement to the interest that would have accrued in their\n\nprofit-sharing accounts had Eaton Vance established and funded the\n\naccounts as required by the Plan.          The insurance policy at issue\n\ncovers debts \"incurred . . . by reason of,\" inter alia, a breach of\n\nfiduciary duty; it does not cover debts that are \"incurred\" through\n\na contractual obligation although belatedly paid because of a\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f            As indicated above, Eaton Vance admits that Hernandez and\n\nother similarly situated employees were, pursuant to the 1984\n\ndocuments, automatically covered unless specifically excluded.\n\nIndeed, the company acknowledges as much in its brief to this\n\ncourt. There, in arguing that it breached its fiduciary duty under\n\nERISA, Eaton Vance concedes that \"[t]he governing Plan documents by\n\ntheir terms made all employees of the 'employer' -- Eaton Vance and\n\nits   commonly   controlled   organizations   –-   Plan   participants.\"\n\n(emphasis added).    Effectively, then, Eaton Vance asserts that the\n\n1984 documents established eligibility so as to render Eaton\n\nVance's failure to fund (in years in which funding was authorized)\n\na breach of fiduciary duty while at the same time arguing that, for\n\npurposes of the Policy, the resulting obligation was incurred by\n\nreasons other than the 1984 documents (and management's decision to\n\nfund in the relevant years).    Eaton Vance cannot have it both ways.\n\n            Would we have reached the same result had the employees'\n\nclaims wound up in litigation?    While not intuitively obvious, the\n\nanswer is yes.      This hypothetical lawsuit might have alleged\n\nseveral theories of liability: for example, (1) breach of Plan\n\ndocuments; (2) breach of fiduciary duties under ERISA; and (3)\n\nfailure to discharge duties or to act prudently within the meaning\n\nof ERISA.    Perhaps Pacific would have associated with Eaton Vance\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fin defending this lawsuit,9 which -– if Eaton Vance's outside ERISA\n\ncounsel is to be believed -- Hernandez might well have won.\n\n             But, in this hypothetical situation, the possibility that\n\nHernandez could have prevailed on one or more of his theories does\n\nnot end our analysis.       Given the underlying facts surrounding the\n\nHernandez claim, any judgment for Hernandez for back-payment of\n\nbenefits wrongfully withheld under the Plan (and the hypothesized\n\namount-of-return thereon) necessarily would be derivative of a\n\nfinding     that   the   Plan   documents    themselves   (together   with\n\nmanagement's discretionary decision to fund) created the underlying\n\nfinancial obligation on which Hernandez sought performance --\n\nperformance that was due Hernandez prior to, and irrespective of,\n\nthe lawsuit.       Accordingly, the Policy's causation requirement –-\n\n\"liability incurred . . . by reason of any actual or alleged\n\n\n\n     9\n         The Policy provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n     Coverage hereunder is extended to pay on behalf of\n     [Eaton Vance] . . . all: . . .\n\n                         DEFENSE EXPENSES\n     EE.

Federated Mut. Ins. Co., 987\n\nF.2d 415 (7th Cir. 1993).     There, mistakenly believing that it had\n\nno liability under a collective bargaining agreement, the employer\n\nintentionally decided not to make payments to an employee pension\n\nfund.        After the fund was successful in its suit against the\n\nemployer for payment of the withheld benefits, the employer sued\n\nits insurer for the value of the unpaid benefits, which allegedly\n\nwere insured under a liability policy.12     The Baylor court denied\n\n\n     10\n      The liability at issue would have been Eaton Vance's\nliability to Hernandez for his share of the $880,869.86, which\nrepresents the amount –- principal and interest -- that Eaton Vance\nbelatedly contributed to the accounts of the excluded employees.\n     11\n      However, if, for example, a group of hypothetical Plan\nparticipants had been successful in a class action against Eaton\nVance (as trustee of the Plan) for damages stemming from the\ntrustee's failure prudently to invest the assets that properly had\nbeen deposited into participants' accounts pursuant to the Plan,\nEaton Vance presumably would have had a claim under the Policy.\n        12\n      Despite Pacific's assertion that Baylor was \"conceptually\nidentical\" to this case, Eaton Vance makes no attempt meaningfully\nto distinguish Baylor. In its brief, Eaton Vance says only that\n\"[t]he discretionary nature of contributions [in this case]\ndistinguishes [Baylor], which involved mandatory contributions\n\n                                  -18-\n\fcoverage, explaining that the judgment against the employer for\n\npension-fund amounts due under a collective bargaining agreement\n\nwas not an \"injury or damage caused by any negligent act, error, or\n\nomission in the administration\" of the program:\n\n          [The employer's] liability to the pension fund\n          is contractual. Although at the time [the\n          employer] refused to make fund payments it did\n          not believe it had any contractual obligation\n          to do so, these beliefs do not change the\n          contractual nature of the obligation.      The\n          Fund was awarded amounts owed pursuant to the\n          collective bargaining agreement, not damages\n          for negligence, and these payments are not\n          covered by [the employer's] policy.\n          . . .\n\n          Under [the employer's] logic, any default\n          arising from a mistaken assumption regarding\n          one's   contractual    liability   could    be\n          transformed into an insured event.     Indeed,\n          refusing to pay a debt in reliance upon\n          erroneous advice of counsel would convert a\n          contractual debt into damage arising from a\n          negligent omission. We dare not imagine the\n          creative legal theories treading just short of\n          malpractice and frivolity that could seek to\n          transform contractual obligations into insured\n          events.\n\n987 F.2d at 419-20.13\n\n\n\nunder a collective bargaining agreement.\"   We do not see why this\ndistinction should impact our analysis.\n     13\n      Similarly, in Oktibbeha County Sch. Dist. v. Corregis Ins.\nCo., 173 F. Supp. 2d 541, 543 (N.D. Miss. 2001), the district court\nreasoned as follows:\n\n     The school district had a duty to pay overtime\n     compensation because of the statutory requirements of the\n     [Fair Labor Standards Act], not because of any wrongful\n     act or omission of the school district.       The school\n\n                               -19-\n\f            We agree with the Seventh Circuit.   It makes no sense to\n\npermit a dereliction in duty to transform an uninsured liability\n\ninto an insured event.    Cf. May Dept. Stores Co. v. Fed. Ins. Co.,\n\n305 F.3d 597, 601 (7th Cir. 2002) (Posner, J.) (\"It would be\n\npassing strange for an insurance company to insure a pension plan\n\n(and its sponsor) against an underpayment of benefits, not only\n\nbecause of the enormous and unpredictable liability to which a\n\nclaim for benefits on behalf of participants in or beneficiaries of\n\na pension plan of a major employer could give rise, but also\n\nbecause of the acute moral hazard problem that such coverage would\n\ncreate. . . . Such insurance would give the plan and its sponsor an\n\nincentive    to   adopt   aggressive   (just     short   of   willful)\n\ninterpretations of ERISA designed to minimize the benefits due,\n\nsafe in the belief that if, as would be likely, the interpretations\n\nwere rejected by the courts, the insurance company would pick up\n\nthe tab.    Heads I win, tails you lose.\").14\n\n\n\n\n     district had a pre-existing obligation to pay these\n     employees for the overtime hours worked, an obligation\n     that was created by the FLSA. The policy states that\n     coverage will issue only if the school district suffered\n     a loss by reason of a wrongful act.      The duty to pay\n     overtime is a matter of statutory law, and the obligation\n     to pay time and a half for every hour worked over a forty\n     hour week arose when the employees worked overtime hours.\n     14\n      We are aware that the policy at issue in May Department\nStores specifically excluded from coverage \"benefits due or to\nbecome due under the [Plan].\"      This fact, however, does not\nundermine the persuasiveness of the analysis quoted in the text.\n\n                                -20-\n\f                               III.\n\n          For these reasons, we conclude that the district court\n\nerred (1) when -- based upon an incorrect finding that the Policy\n\ncovered Eaton Vance's obligation to fund the relevant profit-\n\nsharing accounts -- it held that Eaton Vance was entitled to\n\nsummary judgment for indemnification of amounts contributed to\n\nthese accounts (and prejudgment interest thereon),15 and (2) when\n\nit denied Pacific's cross-motion for a summary-judgment declaration\n\nof no coverage for these amounts.16       The court's judgment is\n\ntherefore reversed in part.   Because we are unable to discern the\n\nextent to which these errors influenced the district court's\n\ndetermination that Pacific also was liable for certain amounts\n\nperipheral to the funding of the accounts,17 the judgment is vacated\n\nin part and remanded so that the court can determine, in the first\n\n\n\n\n     15\n      These amounts total $980,746.14: $880,869.86 + $148,876.28 -\n$49,000. See supra n.5.\n     16\n      Because we conclude that no coverage exists under the Policy\nfor these amounts, we do not reach Eaton Vance's cross-appeal.\nThat appeal challenges the district court's grant of summary\njudgment for Pacific on the separate issue of the Policy's\ndeductible, which became relevant as a result of the district\ncourt's disposition of the coverage issue.\n     17\n      These amounts total $34,392.80: $12,537.00 (the defense and\ninvestigation costs incurred prior to the date on which Eaton Vance\nnotified Pacific of Hernandez's claim) + $5,787.16 (the prejudgment\ninterest on the $12,537) + $13,100.57 (the prejudgment interest on\nthe post-notification costs that belatedly were reimbursed by\nPacific) + $2,968.07 (the costs for deposition transcripts).

The Plan\n\n           Since the 1950s, Eaton Vance Management (\"Eaton Vance\")1\n\nand its predecessors have operated a qualified profit-sharing plan\n\n(\"Plan\")2 for their employees.        Annual contributions to the Plan\n\n\n\n     1\n      Eaton Vance is a Massachusetts business trust, with its\nprincipal place of business in Boston.\n     2\n      The Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") reviewed the Plan and\ndeemed it \"qualified,\" with the result that Eaton Vance may deduct\nany contributions made to it.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fare discretionary and, if made, are derived from Eaton Vance's\n\nprofits in a given fiscal year.     Of particular importance are the\n\nPlan's employee-eligibility criteria.\n\n          Prior   to   November   1984,   employees   of   Eaton   Vance's\n\nsubsidiaries were not included in the Plan unless the respective\n\nsubsidiary expressly adopted the Plan by written resolution.3           In\n\nJuly 1986, Eaton Vance adopted new Plan documents –- effective\n\nNovember 1, 1984 (\"1984 documents\") –- that allegedly broadened the\n\nPlan's eligibility criteria to include automatically subsidiary\n\nemployees unless specifically excluded. Supplying our own emphasis\n\nto language that significantly differs from, or adds to, language\n\nin the prior governing documents, see supra n.3, the 1984 documents\n\nprovide in pertinent part:\n\n          The term employee includes: (a) any common-law\n          employee of the employer . . . .\n\n          \"Employer\" means the employer named in the\n          last section of the adoption agreement, any\n          commonly controlled organization, and any\n          predecessor organization . . . .\n\n          An employee ordinarily becomes an active\n          participant on his entry date. However, there\n          are three exceptions: . . . (c) An employee is\n          not an active participant during any period in\n          which he is not an employee in an eligible\n          class.\n\n\n     3\n      Specifically, the governing documents defined \"employee\" as\n\"any employee of the employer\" and defined \"employer\" as \"the\nemployer named in the Adoption Agreement\" (i.e., Eaton Vance) and\n\"any predecessor organization.\" The documents also provided that\n\"a commonly controlled organization may join the employer in\nadopting this plan . . . by [adopting] a written resolution.\"\n\n                                  -3-\n\f          An employee is in an eligible class unless:\n          [he falls within one of four exceptions not\n          germane to this appeal].\n\n          Subject to the rules of this article, a\n          commonly controlled organization may join the\n          principal employer [Eaton Vance] in adopting\n          this plan. A commonly controlled organization\n          with any employees eligible must join the\n          principal employer in adopting this plan. No\n          other organization may do so.\n\n          An   organization        joins      by      a        written\n          resolution . . . .\n\nIt is uncontested that, despite its adoption of the 1984 documents,\n\nEaton Vance management was unaware of the change in language.\n\n          Because   Eaton   Vance    did    not    intend       to   broaden   the\n\neligibility    criteria   (i.e.,    it    continued       to    believe   that   a\n\nsubsidiary's affirmative adoption of the Plan was a condition\n\nprecedent to the subsidiary's employees' eligibility), it continued\n\nto operate the Plan as it had prior to the adoption of the 1984\n\ndocuments and treated as participants only those employees of those\n\nsubsidiaries that had expressly adopted the Plan.                Accordingly, it\n\ndid not automatically establish accounts in the names of all\n\nsubsidiary employees.     Nor did it specifically exclude them from\n\nthe Plan or provide them with information regarding the Plan.\n\n          B.    The Claim Against Eaton Vance\n\n          On February 2, 1999, Wilfredo Hernandez, then an employee\n\nof an Eaton Vance subsidiary (Compass Management, Inc.), sent to\n\nEaton Vance a letter indicating that money due him under the Plan\n\nhad not been deposited into his account.                  Upon receiving this\n\n                                    -4-\n\fletter, Eaton Vance contacted its outside ERISA counsel for an\n\nevaluation of Hernandez's claim.            Although Compass had not adopted\n\nthe Plan by written resolution, outside counsel advised Eaton Vance\n\nthat, due to the plain language of the 1984 documents, Hernandez\n\nlikely would be successful if he chose to litigate.                        Further,\n\ncounsel      warned   Eaton   Vance    that     there    would    be   serious    tax\n\nconsequences if the IRS discovered that the Plan had not been\n\nadministered according to its terms.                    Eaton Vance thereafter\n\nadopted counsel's advice and has since steadfastly maintained –-\n\nboth before the district court and on appeal –- that the 1984\n\ndocuments were worded so as to cover Hernandez and other similarly\n\nsituated employees.\n\n              On   April    28,   1999,    outside      ERISA    counsel   sent   to\n\nHernandez's attorney a letter acknowledging that Eaton Vance should\n\nhave       recognized      Hernandez      and   other     \"similarly       affected\n\nparticipants\" as Plan participants.              The letter also stated that\n\nEaton Vance would fund those accounts at the level they would have\n\nbeen funded had the employees been recognized as participants all\n\nalong.4\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      In October 1999, Eaton Vance revised the plan language\n(effective November 1, 1998) to reaffirm its intention that\nemployees of subsidiaries are not included in the Plan unless the\nPlan has been adopted by written resolution of the subsidiary.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f              C. The Insurance Policy\n\n              Back in 1998, Pacific Insurance Company (\"Pacific\") had\n\nissued to Eaton Vance a Mutual Fund Errors and Omission Policy\n\n(\"Policy\") effective from August 1, 1997, to August 1, 1999.              The\n\nPolicy provided coverage for\n\n              [l]oss or liability incurred by [Eaton Vance],\n              from any claim made against [Eaton Vance]\n              during the Endorsement Period, by reason of\n              any actual or alleged failure to discharge his\n              or its duties or to act prudently within the\n              meaning of the Employee Retirement Income\n              Security Act of 1974 [\"ERISA\"] . . ., or by\n              reason of any actual or alleged breach of\n              fiduciary responsibility within the meaning of\n              said Act . . . in [Eaton Vance's] capacity as\n              a fiduciary with respect to any pension or\n              employee plan or trust.\n\n              D. The Notification & The Funding of Overdue Accounts\n\n              By letter dated June 18, 1999, Eaton Vance notified\n\nPacific of the Hernandez claim.         Pacific thereafter responded with\n\na    letter    acknowledging    receipt       of   Eaton   Vance's   letter.\n\nSubsequently, Eaton Vance asked Pacific to agree to a filing with\n\nthe IRS under the Voluntary Compliance Review (\"VCR\") program.\n\n(This filing had been proposed by outside ERISA counsel as a means\n\nto   end   Eaton   Vance's   exposure    to   governmental    penalties   for\n\nnoncompliance with the 1984 documents.)            Pacific acknowledged this\n\nrequest but \"before consenting to this action\" urged Eaton Vance to\n\nconsider withholding any additional contributions to the Plan.\n\nPacific further stated that it was \"reserv[ing] its rights\" and\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fadvised Eaton Vance \"to take whatever action [it] deems appropriate\n\nto protect Eaton Vance including the filing of a VCR application.\"\n\n            The   VCR   application    ultimately   was   filed   with,   and\n\napproved by, the IRS.      Although Hernandez had been the only party\n\nto make a claim under the Plan, Eaton Vance thereafter established\n\naccounts for a total of forty-nine employees and contributed\n\n$880,869.86 to those accounts (representing the amount -– principal\n\nand interest –- needed to fund the accounts to the level they would\n\nhave attained had Eaton Vance timely contributed).\n\n            E. The Litigation\n\n            On June 8, 2000, Pacific filed a diversity action in the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts seeking a declaratory judgment of no\n\ncoverage under the Policy.            See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332 and 2201.\n\nSpecifically, Pacific alleged, inter alia, that (1) Eaton Vance did\n\nnot breach its fiduciary duties or fail to discharge its duties or\n\nact prudently within the meaning of ERISA; (2) the obligation to\n\nmake payments is not due \"by reason of\" a breach of fiduciary\n\nresponsibility or \"by reason of\" a failure of Eaton Vance to\n\ndischarge its duties; and, (3) even if there is coverage under the\n\nPolicy, a $1,000 per claim deductible exists for each excluded\n\nemployee.    Eaton Vance counterclaimed, alleging that the Policy\n\ncovered its liabilities.         Eventually, both parties moved for\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f           On August 14, 2002, the district court entered summary\n\njudgment   for   Eaton   Vance   upon   determining,     inter   alia,   that\n\n(1) Eaton Vance had breached its fiduciary duty under ERISA; and\n\n(2) Eaton Vance's liability to the excluded employees was caused by\n\nthis breach.     See Pacific Ins. Co., 260 F. Supp. 2d at 241-44.        The\n\ncourt did find, however, that there existed a $1,000 deductible for\n\neach employee's claim; accordingly, it granted summary judgment to\n\nPacific on this issue.     See id. at 247-48.      Finally, on April 30,\n\n2003, Pacific was ordered to pay Eaton Vance $1,015,138.94.5             See\n\nPacific Ins. Co., 260 F. Supp. 2d at 346-47.\n\n           These cross-appeals followed.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           A.

We therefore\n\nreject Eaton Vance's assertion that \"'by reason of' . . . is a more\n\ngenerous standard that extends coverage beyond the strict 'but-for'\n\ntest Pacific seems to be applying.\"6   See Cody, 439 N.E.2d at 237\n\n(\"A policy of insurance whose provisions are plainly and definitely\n\nexpressed in appropriate language must be enforced in accordance\n\nwith its terms.\" (citations and quotation marks omitted)).\n\n          Having defined the relevant language, we next consider\n\nwhether Eaton Vance's liability to the employees falls within the\n\nPolicy's scope.   Eaton Vance argues that, even under a restrictive\n\nreading of the Policy's causation element, coverage exists because\n\n(1) the cause of Eaton Vance's liability was \"its failure to\n\nadminister the Plan in accordance with the 1984 Plan Documents by\n\nidentifying the proper participants [i.e., Hernandez and other\n\nsimilarly situated employees] and establishing and funding accounts\n\nfor them when contributions were made\"; (2) \"this failure was a\n\n\n     6\n      The authorities that Eaton Vance cites for support (a\nTennessee Supreme Court case and a piece in an insurance journal)\nare not directly on point because they deal with construction of\nthe phrase \"arising out of\" rather than the \"by-reason-of\" language\nat issue here.\n\n                                -11-\n\fbreach of Eaton Vance's fiduciary obligations\"; and that (3)\n\n\"[o]nce [this breach] occurred, no intervention from any other\n\nforce was required to bring about the liability.\"    Presented with\n\na similar argument,7 the district court agreed with Eaton Vance:\n\n\"[The] failure to read the 1984 Plan Documents closely enough to\n\nsee that the scope of the Plan had changed was . . . a breach of\n\nfiduciary duty which resulted in Hernandez's account not being\n\nfunded.\"      Pacific Ins. Co., 260 F. Supp. 2d at 244 (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n             Having had the benefit of additional briefing and oral\n\nargument on this tricky issue, we arrive at a different conclusion.\n\nAs we see it, the relevant liability for which Eaton Vance seeks\n\nrecovery from its insurer is not one for breach of fiduciary duty\n\nrelative to the belatedly funded employee accounts; rather, Eaton\n\nVance seeks reimbursement for amounts it paid -– principal and\n\ninterest –- in satisfaction of its Plan-created obligation to\n\nestablish and fund those accounts to the level they would have\n\nattained had Eaton Vance initially complied with the Plan.       So\n\n\n\n     7\n         Specifically, Eaton Vance argued that\n\n     simply signing the 1984 Plan documents did not\n     proximately cause Hernandez's account to be unfunded[;]\n     [r]ather, the cause of Hernandez's unfunded account was\n     that Eaton Vance did not administer the Plan in\n     accordance with its terms, which is a breach of fiduciary\n     duty under ERISA that is covered by the Policy.\n\nPacific Ins. Co., 260 F. Supp. 2d at 243-44 (emphasis added).\n\n                                 -12-\n\funderstood, the cause of this obligation cannot be the breach of\n\nthe obligation; instead, in our view, this obligation derived from\n\nthe broadened eligibility criteria in the 1984 documents themselves\n\n(as now interpreted by Eaton Vance), management's discretionary\n\ndecision to fund, and the employees' concomitant entitlement to\n\ninterest that would have accrued in their profit-sharing accounts\n\nhad Eaton Vance acted in accordance with the Plan by establishing\n\nand funding the accounts.8     See, e.g., American Cas. Co. of\n\n\n     8\n      The interest at issue here is, essentially, the prejudgment\ninterest that a court might have awarded Hernandez and others had\nthey elected to litigate their claims for payment of benefits due\nunder the Plan.

Sparrow, Johnson & Ursillo, Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197093\"><a href=\"/opinion/197093/cottrill-v-sparrow/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 223-24 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"In ERISA cases the district\ncourt may grant prejudgment interest in its discretion to\nprevailing fiduciaries, beneficiaries, or plan participants. . . .\nOrdinarily a cause of action under ERISA and prejudgment interest\non a plan participant's claim both accrue when a fiduciary denies\na participant's benefits. . . . Setting the accrual date in this\nmanner not only advances the general purposes of prejudgment\ninterest . . . but also serves ERISA's remedial objectives by\nmaking a participant whole for the period during which the\nfiduciary withholds money legally due. . . . Figuring the accrual\ndate in this way also prevents unjust enrichment.\" (citations\nomitted)). Accordingly, as we see it, the interest portion of the\n$880,869.86 is part and parcel of what is due the employees under\nthe Plan and, as such, is not a liability incurred by reason of a\nbreach of fiduciary duty.\n     The result we reach makes sense from a policy perspective as\nwell. Because Eaton Vance wrongfully withheld the principal, it\npresumably was able to earn interest on these monies –- interest\nthat otherwise would have been earned by the employees on their\naccounts. As such, the interest represents benefits to Eaton Vance\non monies wrongfully withheld. If we were to hold that the Policy\ncovers these amounts, Eaton Vance would reap a substantial\nwindfall.    This result would create a perverse incentive for\nemployers negligently to delay contributions while retaining the\nmonies in an interest-earning account safe in the belief that any\ninterest earned would be theirs to keep.\n     In any event, Eaton Vance made no significant effort –- either\n\n                               -13-\n\fReading, Pa. v.

See 7 G.

Eaton Vance essentially argues this same\n\npoint   in   its   brief:   \"Had   Eaton   Vance   administered   the   Plan\n\naccording to its terms during each affected year, the omitted\n\nparticipants would have had funded accounts at the time they came\n\nto seek benefits.\"\n\n             But the fact that the alleged breach of fiduciary duty\n\nresulted in the late payment of funds does not alter the essential\n\nfact that the liability was \"incurred . . . by reason of\" the\n\nadoption of the 1984 documents, management's discretionary decision\n\nto fund the accounts of eligible employees, and the employees'\n\nentitlement to the interest that would have accrued in their\n\nprofit-sharing accounts had Eaton Vance established and funded the\n\naccounts as required by the Plan.          The insurance policy at issue\n\ncovers debts \"incurred . . . by reason of,\" inter alia, a breach of\n\nfiduciary duty; it does not cover debts that are \"incurred\" through\n\na contractual obligation although belatedly paid because of a\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f            As indicated above, Eaton Vance admits that Hernandez and\n\nother similarly situated employees were, pursuant to the 1984\n\ndocuments, automatically covered unless specifically excluded.\n\nIndeed, the company acknowledges as much in its brief to this\n\ncourt. There, in arguing that it breached its fiduciary duty under\n\nERISA, Eaton Vance concedes that \"[t]he governing Plan documents by\n\ntheir terms made all employees of the 'employer' -- Eaton Vance and\n\nits   commonly   controlled   organizations   –-   Plan   participants.\"\n\n(emphasis added).    Effectively, then, Eaton Vance asserts that the\n\n1984 documents established eligibility so as to render Eaton\n\nVance's failure to fund (in years in which funding was authorized)\n\na breach of fiduciary duty while at the same time arguing that, for\n\npurposes of the Policy, the resulting obligation was incurred by\n\nreasons other than the 1984 documents (and management's decision to\n\nfund in the relevant years).    Eaton Vance cannot have it both ways.\n\n            Would we have reached the same result had the employees'\n\nclaims wound up in litigation?    While not intuitively obvious, the\n\nanswer is yes.      This hypothetical lawsuit might have alleged\n\nseveral theories of liability: for example, (1) breach of Plan\n\ndocuments; (2) breach of fiduciary duties under ERISA; and (3)\n\nfailure to discharge duties or to act prudently within the meaning\n\nof ERISA.    Perhaps Pacific would have associated with Eaton Vance\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fin defending this lawsuit,9 which -– if Eaton Vance's outside ERISA\n\ncounsel is to be believed -- Hernandez might well have won.\n\n             But, in this hypothetical situation, the possibility that\n\nHernandez could have prevailed on one or more of his theories does\n\nnot end our analysis.       Given the underlying facts surrounding the\n\nHernandez claim, any judgment for Hernandez for back-payment of\n\nbenefits wrongfully withheld under the Plan (and the hypothesized\n\namount-of-return thereon) necessarily would be derivative of a\n\nfinding     that   the   Plan   documents    themselves   (together   with\n\nmanagement's discretionary decision to fund) created the underlying\n\nfinancial obligation on which Hernandez sought performance --\n\nperformance that was due Hernandez prior to, and irrespective of,\n\nthe lawsuit.

There, mistakenly believing that it had\n\nno liability under a collective bargaining agreement, the employer\n\nintentionally decided not to make payments to an employee pension\n\nfund.        After the fund was successful in its suit against the\n\nemployer for payment of the withheld benefits, the employer sued\n\nits insurer for the value of the unpaid benefits, which allegedly\n\nwere insured under a liability policy.12     The Baylor court denied\n\n\n     10\n      The liability at issue would have been Eaton Vance's\nliability to Hernandez for his share of the $880,869.86, which\nrepresents the amount –- principal and interest -- that Eaton Vance\nbelatedly contributed to the accounts of the excluded employees.\n     11\n      However, if, for example, a group of hypothetical Plan\nparticipants had been successful in a class action against Eaton\nVance (as trustee of the Plan) for damages stemming from the\ntrustee's failure prudently to invest the assets that properly had\nbeen deposited into participants' accounts pursuant to the Plan,\nEaton Vance presumably would have had a claim under the Policy.\n        12\n      Despite Pacific's assertion that Baylor was \"conceptually\nidentical\" to this case, Eaton Vance makes no attempt meaningfully\nto distinguish Baylor. In its brief, Eaton Vance says only that\n\"[t]he discretionary nature of contributions [in this case]\ndistinguishes [Baylor], which involved mandatory contributions\n\n                                  -18-\n\fcoverage, explaining that the judgment against the employer for\n\npension-fund amounts due under a collective bargaining agreement\n\nwas not an \"injury or damage caused by any negligent act, error, or\n\nomission in the administration\" of the program:\n\n          [The employer's] liability to the pension fund\n          is contractual. Although at the time [the\n          employer] refused to make fund payments it did\n          not believe it had any contractual obligation\n          to do so, these beliefs do not change the\n          contractual nature of the obligation.      The\n          Fund was awarded amounts owed pursuant to the\n          collective bargaining agreement, not damages\n          for negligence, and these payments are not\n          covered by [the employer's] policy.\n          . . .\n\n          Under [the employer's] logic, any default\n          arising from a mistaken assumption regarding\n          one's   contractual    liability   could    be\n          transformed into an insured event.     Indeed,\n          refusing to pay a debt in reliance upon\n          erroneous advice of counsel would convert a\n          contractual debt into damage arising from a\n          negligent omission. We dare not imagine the\n          creative legal theories treading just short of\n          malpractice and frivolity that could seek to\n          transform contractual obligations into insured\n          events.\n\n987 F.2d at 419-20.13\n\n\n\nunder a collective bargaining agreement.\"   We do not see why this\ndistinction should impact our analysis.\n     13\n      Similarly, in Oktibbeha County Sch.

(\"It would be\n\npassing strange for an insurance company to insure a pension plan\n\n(and its sponsor) against an underpayment of benefits, not only\n\nbecause of the enormous and unpredictable liability to which a\n\nclaim for benefits on behalf of participants in or beneficiaries of\n\na pension plan of a major employer could give rise, but also\n\nbecause of the acute moral hazard problem that such coverage would\n\ncreate. . . . Such insurance would give the plan and its sponsor an\n\nincentive    to   adopt   aggressive   (just     short   of   willful)\n\ninterpretations of ERISA designed to minimize the benefits due,\n\nsafe in the belief that if, as would be likely, the interpretations\n\nwere rejected by the courts, the insurance company would pick up\n\nthe tab.    Heads I win, tails you lose.\").14\n\n\n\n\n     district had a pre-existing obligation to pay these\n     employees for the overtime hours worked, an obligation\n     that was created by the FLSA. The policy states that\n     coverage will issue only if the school district suffered\n     a loss by reason of a wrongful act.      The duty to pay\n     overtime is a matter of statutory law, and the obligation\n     to pay time and a half for every hour worked over a forty\n     hour week arose when the employees worked overtime hours.\n     14\n      We are aware that the policy at issue in May Department\nStores specifically excluded from coverage \"benefits due or to\nbecome due under the [Plan].\"      This fact, however, does not\nundermine the persuasiveness of the analysis quoted in the text.\n\n                                -20-\n\f                               III.\n\n          For these reasons, we conclude that the district court\n\nerred (1) when -- based upon an incorrect finding that the Policy\n\ncovered Eaton Vance's obligation to fund the relevant profit-\n\nsharing accounts -- it held that Eaton Vance was entitled to\n\nsummary judgment for indemnification of amounts contributed to\n\nthese accounts (and prejudgment interest thereon),15 and (2) when\n\nit denied Pacific's cross-motion for a summary-judgment declaration\n\nof no coverage for these amounts.16       The court's judgment is\n\ntherefore reversed in part.   Because we are unable to discern the\n\nextent to which these errors influenced the district court's\n\ndetermination that Pacific also was liable for certain amounts\n\nperipheral to the funding of the accounts,17 the judgment is vacated\n\nin part and remanded so that the court can determine, in the first\n\n\n\n\n     15\n      These amounts total $980,746.14: $880,869.86 + $148,876.28 -\n$49,000. See supra n.5.\n     16\n      Because we conclude that no coverage exists under the Policy\nfor these amounts, we do not reach Eaton Vance's cross-appeal.\nThat appeal challenges the district court's grant of summary\njudgment for Pacific on the separate issue of the Policy's\ndeductible, which became relevant as a result of the district\ncourt's disposition of the coverage issue.\n     17\n      These amounts total $34,392.80: $12,537.00 (the defense and\ninvestigation costs incurred prior to the date on which Eaton Vance\nnotified Pacific of Hernandez's claim) + $5,787.16 (the prejudgment\ninterest on the $12,537) + $13,100.57 (the prejudgment interest on\nthe post-notification costs that belatedly were reimbursed by\nPacific) + $2,968.07 (the costs for deposition transcripts). See\nsupra n.5.\n\n                               -21-\n\finstance, whether Eaton Vance remains entitled to these amounts in\n\nlight of this opinion.   Each party shall bear its own costs.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -22-\n\f</pre>",
