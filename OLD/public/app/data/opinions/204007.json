Appellant Luis González-\n\nColón (“González”) appeals the 97-month sentence he received after\n\npleading guilty to conspiring to distribute a controlled substance.\n\nAppellant Roberto De León-Martínez (“De León”) appeals a 24-month\n\nsentence he received for the same charge.                 We have jurisdiction\n\nunder   18   U.S.C.    §   3742(a),   and    dismiss   the   appeals   of   both\n\nappellants, because each signed a valid and enforceable waiver of\n\nappeal in his respective plea agreement.\n\n                   I. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n     From approximately February 2005 until their indictment on\n\nDecember     20,   2006,   González    and    De   León    participated     in   a\n\nconspiracy with ten others to distribute cocaine base (“crack”) in\n\nGuayama, Puerto Rico.        The two entered into plea agreements with\n\nthe government and on September 18, 2007, González pled guilty to\n\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least 35, but\n\nless than 50, grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841 (a) (1), 841(b)(1)(B), and 846.          On the same date, De León pled\n\nguilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least\n\n4, but less than 5, grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a)(1), 846.\n\n     The terms of González’s plea agreement provided for a total\n\noffense level of 29.       The parties did not stipulate to any criminal\n\nhistory category, but presumed a category of III, yielding a\n\nguideline range of 108-135 months’ imprisonment.               Under a section\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\ftitled “Sentencing Agreement,” the agreement stated, “The parties\n\nagree to recommend a term of imprisonment of one hundred eight\n\n(108) months or the lower end of the applicable guideline range,\n\nwhichever is greater.”\n\n     In calculating the applicable criminal history category, the\n\nPresentence Investigation Report (“PSI”) for González noted that on\n\nJuly 11, 2006, González had been sentenced by the Superior Court in\n\nPuerto Rico to three consecutive five-year terms of imprisonment\n\nfor drug arrests dating from November 4, 2004, August 1, 2005, and\n\nJanuary   30,   2006.   The   commonwealth   court   had   suspended   the\n\nsentences and placed González on probation.            Concluding that\n\nGonzález was therefore on probation for a prior sentence at the\n\ntime he committed the instant offense, the PSI added two points to\n\nGonzález’s criminal history score pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d),\n\nresulting in a criminal history category of II.\n\n     At his sentencing hearing, González challenged the PSI’s\n\nrecommendation of a criminal history category of II, arguing that\n\nbecause the two specific drug transactions named in the plea\n\nagreement occurred on March 2 and April 11, 2006, they predated the\n\nstate court’s imposition of probation on July 11, 2006, and thus\n\ntwo points should not have been added under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d).\n\nThe court denied the motion.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f      The court then noted that with a criminal history category of\n\nII, and a total offense level of 27,1 the Guidelines recommended a\n\nrange of 78 to 97 months. At that point, González’s counsel stated\n\nthat the plea agreement called for a sentence of “108 [months] or\n\nthe   upper    end   of    the    applicable    guideline.”      In    fact,   the\n\nsentencing agreement called for 108 months or the lower end of the\n\napplicable guideline, whichever was greater — meaning 108 months\n\nminimum.      Neither party noted or objected to the misstatement, and\n\nthe district court sentenced González to 97 months.\n\n      As for De León, the terms of his plea agreement yielded a\n\ntotal offense level of 19.               The parties agreed to neither a\n\ncriminal history category nor a particular guideline sentence,\n\nagreeing only to “argue for a sentence within the applicable\n\nguideline range.”\n\n      The PSI calculated a criminal history category of I, leading\n\nto a guideline range of 24 to 30 months.                  The district court\n\nsentenced De León to 24 months’ imprisonment.\n\n      Both plea agreements, for González and for De León, contained\n\na   waiver    of   the    right   to   appeal   the   judgment   and   sentence,\n\nproviding, “The defendant hereby agrees that if this Honorable\n\nCourt accepts this agreement and sentences him according to its\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          The district court reduced the offense level calculation\nfrom the plea agreement following the November 1, 2007, amendments\nto the Guidelines.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fterms and conditions, defendant waives and surrenders his right to\n\nappeal the judgment and sentence in this case.”\n\n     González nonetheless appeals his sentence, arguing that the\n\ndistrict court sentenced him on the basis of “faulty memory” and\n\nunder an incorrect calculation of his criminal history category.\n\nDe León also appeals, arguing that the district court impermissibly\n\nparticipated in plea bargain discussions.\n\n                               II. Discussion\n\nGonzález-Colón\n\n     We must first determine whether González’s appellate waiver is\n\nvalid and enforceable.     Concluding that it is, we decline to reach\n\nthe merits of his appeal.\n\n     In United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14 (1st Cir. 2001), we\n\nestablished the standard for reviewing appellate waivers, and held\n\nthat such waivers are binding and enforceable so long as: (1) the\n\nwritten plea agreement clearly delineates the scope of the waiver;\n\n(2) the district court specifically inquired at the plea hearing\n\nabout the waiver, and the questioning of the defendant suffices to\n\nshow that the waiver was knowing and voluntary; and (3) the denial\n\nof the right to appeal would not constitute a miscarriage of\n\njustice.   Id. at 24-25.   We must also be satisfied that the appeal\n\nfalls within the scope of the waiver.    See United States v. Acosta-\n\nRoman, 549 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f     The first Teeter factor is easily met.        The language of the\n\nwaiver,   quoted   above,   has   been   upheld   in   nearly   identical\n\niterations, and González effectively concedes this point.             See\n\nUnited States v. De-La-Cruz Castro, 299 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n     On the second Teeter factor, González argues that the district\n\ncourt failed to describe or discuss the waiver in any way.           The\n\nrecord belies this assertion.       The district court twice queried\n\nGonzález about the waiver at the change-of-plea hearing, and used\n\nclear language in doing so (“Do you understand that by pleading\n\nguilty, you will be held accountable to the waiver of appeal clause\n\nthat appears in your respective plea agreements?”).        It also asked\n\nabout the waiver again at the sentencing hearing, and used no\n\nmisleading or contradictory language at any time. Accordingly, the\n\nsecond Teeter factor is satisfied.         See United States v. Gil-\n\nQuezada, 445 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir. 2006); De-La-Cruz Castro, 299\n\nF.3d at 11-12.\n\n     On the third Teeter factor, González claims that enforcing the\n\nwaiver would amount to a miscarriage of justice, because the\n\ndistrict court erred in calculating his criminal history category.2\n\n\n     2\n          González also argues for a miscarriage of justice because\nthe district court acted with a “faulty memory” in sentencing him\nto 97 months, a deviation from the sentencing recommendation in the\nplea agreement. Because, however, the plea agreement called for a\nminimum of 108 months, we fail to see how the defendant’s windfall\namounts to a miscarriage of justice. The better argument on this\nissue — though not by much — is that the deviation means the\nsentence is outside of the scope of the waiver, and therefore the\nwaiver is inapplicable. We address this argument below.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fGonzález argues that two points should not have been added to his\n\ncriminal   history    score    pursuant   to   U.S.S.G.   §   4A1.1(d)   for\n\ncommitting the instant offense while on probation for a prior\n\nsentence, because the federal conspiracy indictment “encompassed”\n\nall the transactions at issue in the July 11, 2006, commonwealth\n\ncourt proceeding.      Therefore, his thesis runs, the commonwealth\n\ncourt sentence was not a “prior sentence” under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2,3\n\nand the probation resulting from it may not be counted under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d).\n\n     In reviewing González’s argument, we note that the miscarriage\n\nof justice exception should be applied “sparingly and without undue\n\ngenerosity.”   Teeter, 257 F.3d at 26.          Relevant factors include\n\n“the clarity of the alleged error, its character and gravity, its\n\nimpact on the defendant, any possible prejudice to the government,\n\nand the extent to which the defendant acquiesced in the result.\"\n\nGil-Quezada, 445 F.3d at 37 (citing Teeter, 257 F.3d at 26).\n\n     Several   of    those    factors   militate   against    invoking   the\n\nexception in this case.\n\n     First, González failed to raise this issue before the district\n\ncourt, despite having ample opportunity to detail the reach and\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a)(1) defines a “prior sentence” as “any\nsentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt...for\nconduct not part of the instant offense.”\n\n                                    -8-\n\fscope of the state conviction.4       We are wary of invoking the\n\nmiscarriage-of-justice exception when the defendant could have\n\nraised an argument below but did not.        See United States v.\n\nCardona-Diaz, 524 F.3d 20, 23-24 (1st Cir. 2008); see also United\n\nStates v. Edelen, 539 F.3d 83, 87 (1st Cir. 2008) (“If the mere\n\nfact that a defendant has arguments he could potentially invoke on\n\nappeal were allowed to invalidate a waiver, then appellate waivers\n\nwould become meaningless.”).\n\n     Second, González seeks to anchor his new claim to proceedings\n\nin commonwealth court that postdate the sentencing in this case —\n\nspecifically, a recent state court probation revocation hearing\n\nthat concluded the commonwealth and federal charges were the\n\n“same.”   However, “post-sentencing maneuvers ordinarily cannot be\n\nused as history-altering devices,” and thus this court strongly\n\ndisfavors granting relief on the basis of a record not before the\n\ndistrict court.   See United States v. Mateo, 271 F.3d 11, 15 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).\n\n\n\n\n     4\n          Indeed, before the district court, González argued for\nsomething like the reverse: that because the “instant offense”\nincluded only the March and April 2006 drug sales detailed in the\nplea agreement, it predated the state court’s imposition of\nprobation on July 11, 2006, and therefore adding two points\npursuant to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d) was error.      The district court\nproperly concluded that because the instant offense was a\nconspiracy, it did not end until the December 20, 2006, indictment,\nsee United States v. Hernandez, 541 F.3d 422, 425 (1st Cir. 2008),\nat which point González had already been placed on probation by the\ncommonwealth court.\n\n                                -9-\n\f      Third, it is debatable — if not doubtful — whether a different\n\ncalculation of González’s criminal history category would have\n\naffected the final sentence. Because González failed to raise this\n\nargument below, the plain error standard is incorporated into our\n\nassessment of the miscarriage-of-justice element.                 Thus González\n\nmust show not merely that the error “could have changed the\n\noutcome,” but rather that “the error must have done so.”                   United\n\nStates v. Albanese, 287 F.3d 226, 229 n.1 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Sposito, 106 F.3d 1042, 1049-50 (1st Cir. 1997))\n\n(applying    plain     error   standard   to    alleged    miscalculation         of\n\ncriminal history category).\n\n      In this case, the sentencing agreement called for a minimum of\n\n108 months’ imprisonment — regardless of the final criminal history\n\ncategory.      Moreover, “we have recognized that when parties agree\n\nthat the government will recommend a certain sentence, they do so\n\nwith the understanding that it is likely the district court will\n\naccept   the    recommendation.”        Cardona-Diaz,      524    F.3d     at    24.\n\nTherefore, even if the district court had calculated a different\n\ncriminal history category, “we cannot be certain that the court\n\nwould not have imposed a similar sentence anyway.”               Id.    Indeed, it\n\nmay   have   imposed    a   higher   sentence   in   accord      with    the    plea\n\nagreement’s recommendation of a 108-month minimum.                      González’s\n\nfailure to show the probability of a different sentence militates\n\nagainst finding a miscarriage of justice.            Id.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f              Finally, we would also note that, on the merits of\n\nGonzález’s     challenge,       the   July    11,     2006,    commonwealth        court\n\nsentence included a five-year term of imprisonment for marijuana\n\ncharges following a November 4, 2004, arrest in Guayama, which\n\npredates the beginning of the federal conspiracy by three months.\n\nThus, whether the probation was properly counted as a “prior\n\nsentence” under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2 is unclear at best.\n\n       Assessing   these       factors   in     total,   we    conclude     that    the\n\n“limited character and gravity” of the alleged error, its uncertain\n\nimpact on the final sentence, the defendant’s failure to raise the\n\nissue    below,    and   the     defendant’s        reliance    on    post-sentence\n\nproceedings suggest that there is no miscarriage of justice in\n\nenforcing the waiver.          See Cardona-Diaz, 524 F.3d at 24.              Finding\n\nall of the Teeter factors satisfied, we conclude that the waiver is\n\nvalid and enforceable.\n\n       Lastly, González argues that, even if the waiver is valid and\n\nenforceable, this appeal does not come within its scope, because\n\nthe district court did not sentence the defendant according to the\n\nplea agreement’s “terms and conditions.”                  Instead, the district\n\ncourt acted with “faulty memory” in deviating from the sentencing\n\nrecommendation, and hence the waiver never took effect.\n\n       This   argument    has    little      traction.        For    one,   the     plea\n\nagreement called only for a recommendation to be made to the judge\n\nand,    insofar    as    the    agreement       was    presented      to    him,    the\n\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\frecommendation was made.          For another, the defendant’s counsel was\n\ncomplicit       in    the   mistake    about     the    terms   of    the     agreement,\n\nmisquoting the sentencing recommendation to omit the fact that 108\n\nmonths was to be the minimum sentence.                    Finally, the defendant\n\nobviously benefitted from the mistake.                     A district court that\n\nimposes     a    sentence     lower    than    that     recommended      by    the    plea\n\nagreement, yet acquiesced to by both parties, cannot in any sense\n\nbe   said   to       have   exceeded   the     “terms    and    conditions”      of   the\n\nagreement.       See, e.g., Acosta-Roman, 549 F.3d at 4 (district court\n\nexercising discretion that was contemplated by the plea agreement\n\ndid not exceed the “terms and conditions” of that agreement).\n\n      We therefore enforce the appeal waiver agreed to by the\n\nparties.\n\nDe León-Martínez\n\n                We apply the same Teeter analysis to the contentions of\n\nDe León.         De León does not dispute that the first two Teeter\n\nfactors are met in his case.             Rather, he argues that enforcing the\n\nwaiver would be a miscarriage of justice, because the district\n\ncourt   impermissibly         inserted    itself       into    the   plea     bargaining\n\nprocess, in violation of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c).                     De León points to\n\nthree such incidents that ostensibly violate the Rule, but none\n\nwithstands close scrutiny.\n\n                First, during a status conference, the court inquired\n\ninto the likelihood of a plea bargain and then stated, “I’m\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\favailable to discuss the case any time. You just let me know.”    We\n\nfail to see how such an innocuous comment constitutes impermissible\n\nintervention in the plea bargaining process, and in any event, “a\n\nsingle brief remark during negotiations [has] been held not to\n\nconstitute      impermissible   judicial   participation   in   plea\n\ndiscussions.”     United States v. Bradley, 455 F.3d 453, 462 (4th\n\nCir. 2006); see also United States v. Uribe-Londono, 409 F.3d 1, 4\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (holding there was no error when court “simply\n\ninquired about the status of any plea negotiations”).\n\n           Second, at the change of plea hearing, after the parties\n\nhad reached a plea agreement, De León’s counsel voiced his concern\n\nthat, notwithstanding the plea agreement’s recommendation of a 30-\n\nmonth minimum sentence, an impending change to the Guidelines might\n\nyield a lower sentencing calculation.       In response, the court\n\nreiterated that it had final authority over the sentence, and\n\nindicated it would schedule the sentencing hearing for November 15,\n\n2007, after any change to the Guidelines had taken effect.\n\n           Informing the defendant about the court’s authority and\n\ncalendaring options after a plea agreement had been reached does\n\nnot constitute “participation” in the plea bargaining process in\n\nany way.     “Because the plea negotiations between the parties had\n\ncome to an end and the parties had signed a written plea agreement\n\nbefore the district judge was involved, it is hard to characterize\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fthe judge's comments as participation in any [plea] discussions.”\n\nUnited States v. Cannady, 283 F.3d 641, 644 (4th Cir. 2002).\n\n          Finally, at a hearing on De León’s motion for new counsel\n\nconducted a week prior to sentencing, the court questioned the\n\ndefendant about his dissatisfaction with counsel, reiterated that\n\nthe court had ultimate sentencing authority over the defendant, and\n\npraised the defendant’s counsel.         Nothing forbids a court “from\n\nquestioning the defendant regarding the terms, consequences, and\n\nacceptance of the plea agreement or from providing the defendant\n\nwith information relating to these matters,” and we perceive no\n\nerror here.

Appellant Roberto De León-Martínez (\"De León\") appeals a 24-month sentence he received for the same charge. We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a), and dismiss the appeals of both appellants, because each signed a valid and enforceable waiver of appeal in his respective plea agreement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Factual and Procedural Background</h2>\n<p>From approximately February 2005 until their indictment on December 20, 2006, González and De León participated in a conspiracy with ten others to distribute cocaine base (\"crack\") in Guayama, Puerto Rico. The two entered into plea agreements with the government and on September 18, 2007, González pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least 35, but less than 50, grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B), and 846. On the same date, De León pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least 4, but less than 5, grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846.</p>\n<p>The terms of González's plea agreement provided for a total offense level of 29. The parties did not stipulate to any criminal history category, but presumed a category of III, yielding a guideline range of 108-135 months' imprisonment. Under a section titled \"Sentencing Agreement,\" the agreement stated, \"The parties agree to recommend a term of imprisonment of one hundred eight (108) months or the lower end of the applicable guideline range, whichever is greater.\"</p>\n<p>In calculating the applicable criminal history category, the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSI\") for González noted that on July 11, 2006, González had been sentenced by the Superior Court in Puerto Rico to three consecutive five-year terms of imprisonment for drug arrests dating from November 4, 2004, August 1, 2005, and January 30, 2006. The commonwealth court had suspended the sentences and placed González on probation. Concluding that González was therefore on probation for a prior sentence at the time he committed the instant offense, the PSI added two points to González's criminal history score pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d), resulting in a criminal history category of II.</p>\n<p>At his sentencing hearing, González challenged the PSI's recommendation of a criminal history category of II, arguing that because the two specific drug transactions named in the plea agreement occurred on March 2 and April 11, 2006, they predated the state court's imposition of probation on July 11, 2006, and thus two points should not have been added under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d). The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p>The court then noted that with a criminal history category of II, and a total offense level of 27,<sup>[1]</sup> the Guidelines recommended a range of 78 to 97 months. At that point, González's counsel stated that the plea agreement called for a sentence of \"108 [months] or the upper end of the applicable guideline.\" In fact, the sentencing agreement called for 108 months or the lower end of the applicable guideline, whichever was <i>greater</i>meaning 108 months minimum. Neither party noted or objected to the misstatement, and the district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> court sentenced González to 97 months.</p>\n<p>As for De León, the terms of his plea agreement yielded a total offense level of 19. The parties agreed to neither a criminal history category nor a particular guideline sentence, agreeing only to \"argue for a sentence within the applicable guideline range.\"</p>\n<p>The PSI calculated a criminal history category of I, leading to a guideline range of 24 to 30 months. The district court sentenced De León to 24 months' imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Both plea agreements, for González and for De León, contained a waiver of the right to appeal the judgment and sentence, providing, \"The defendant hereby agrees that if this Honorable Court accepts this agreement and sentences him according to its terms and conditions, defendant waives and surrenders his right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case.\"</p>\n<p>González nonetheless appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court sentenced him on the basis of \"faulty memory\" and under an incorrect calculation of his criminal history category. De León also appeals, arguing that the district court impermissibly participated in plea bargain discussions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Discussion</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>González-Colón</i></h2>\n<p>We must first determine whether González's appellate waiver is valid and enforceable. Concluding that it is, we decline to reach the merits of his appeal.</p>\n<p>In <i>United States v. Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d 14 (1st Cir.2001), we established the standard for reviewing appellate waivers, and held that such waivers are binding and enforceable so long as: (1) the written plea agreement clearly delineates the scope of the waiver; (2) the district court specifically inquired at the plea hearing about the waiver, and the questioning of the defendant suffices to show that the waiver was knowing and voluntary; and (3) the denial of the right to appeal would not constitute a miscarriage of justice. <i>Id.</i> at 24-25. We must also be satisfied that the appeal falls within the scope of the waiver. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Acosta-Roman,</i> 549 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>The first <i>Teeter</i> factor is easily met. The language of the waiver, quoted above, has been upheld in nearly identical iterations, and González effectively concedes this point. <i>See </i><i>United States v. De-La-Cruz Castro,</i> 299 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>On the second <i>Teeter</i> factor, González argues that the district court failed to describe or discuss the waiver in any way. The record belies this assertion. The district court twice queried González about the waiver at the change-of-plea hearing, and used clear language in doing so (\"Do you understand that by pleading guilty, you will be held accountable to the waiver of appeal clause that appears in your respective plea agreements?\"). It also asked about the waiver again at the sentencing hearing, and used no misleading or contradictory language at any time. Accordingly, the second <i>Teeter</i> factor is satisfied. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gil-Quezada,</i> 445 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir.2006); <i>De-La-Cruz Castro,</i> 299 F.3d at 11-12.</p>\n<p>On the third <i>Teeter</i> factor, González claims that enforcing the waiver would amount to a miscarriage of justice, because the district court erred in calculating his criminal history category.<sup>[2]</sup> González argues <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> that two points should not have been added to his criminal history score pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d) for committing the instant offense while on probation for a prior sentence, because the federal conspiracy indictment \"encompassed\" all the transactions at issue in the July 11, 2006, commonwealth court proceeding. Therefore, his thesis runs, the commonwealth court sentence was not a \"prior sentence\" under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2,<sup>[3]</sup> and the probation resulting from it may not be counted under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d).</p>\n<p>In reviewing González's argument, we note that the miscarriage of justice exception should be applied \"sparingly and without undue generosity.\" <i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 26. Relevant factors include \"the clarity of the alleged error, its character and gravity, its impact on the defendant, any possible prejudice to the government, and the extent to which the defendant acquiesced in the result.\" <i>Gil-Quezada,</i> 445 F.3d at 37 (citing <i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 26).</p>\n<p>Several of those factors militate against invoking the exception in this case.</p>\n<p>First, González failed to raise this issue before the district court, despite having ample opportunity to detail the reach and scope of the state conviction.<sup>[4]</sup> We are wary of invoking the miscarriage-of-justice exception when the defendant could have raised an argument below but did not. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cardona-Diaz,</i> 524 F.3d 20, 23-24 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Edelen,</i> 539 F.3d 83, 87 (1st Cir.2008) (\"If the mere fact that a defendant has arguments he could potentially invoke on appeal were allowed to invalidate a waiver, then appellate waivers would become meaningless.\").</p>\n<p>Second, González seeks to anchor his new claim to proceedings in commonwealth court that postdate the sentencing in this case-specifically, a recent state court probation revocation hearing that concluded the commonwealth and federal charges were the \"same.\" However, \"post-sentencing maneuvers ordinarily cannot be used as history-altering devices,\" and thus this court strongly disfavors granting relief on the basis of a record not before the district court. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Mateo,</i> 271 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>Third, it is debatableif not doubtful whether a different calculation of González's criminal history category would have affected the final sentence. Because González failed to raise this argument below, the plain error standard is incorporated into our assessment of the miscarriage-of-justice element. Thus González must show not merely that the error \"<i>could have</i> changed the outcome,\" but rather <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> that \"the error <i>must have</i> done so.\" <i>United States v. Albanese,</i> 287 F.3d 226, 229 n. 1 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>United States v. Sposito,</i> 106 F.3d 1042, 1049-50 (1st Cir. 1997)) (applying plain error standard to alleged miscalculation of criminal history category).</p>\n<p>In this case, the sentencing agreement called for a minimum of 108 months' imprisonmentregardless of the final criminal history category. Moreover, \"we have recognized that when parties agree that the government will recommend a certain sentence, they do so with the understanding that it is likely the district court will accept the recommendation.\" <i>Cardona-Diaz,</i> 524 F.3d at 24. Therefore, even if the district court had calculated a different criminal history category, \"we cannot be certain that the court would not have imposed a similar sentence anyway.\" <i>Id.</i> Indeed, it may have imposed a <i>higher</i> sentence in accord with the plea agreement's recommendation of a 108-month minimum. González's failure to show the probability of a different sentence militates against finding a miscarriage of justice. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Finally, we would also note that, on the merits of González's challenge, the July 11, 2006, commonwealth court sentence included a five-year term of imprisonment for marijuana charges following a November 4, 2004, arrest in Guayama, which predates the beginning of the federal conspiracy by three months. Thus, whether the probation was properly counted as a \"prior sentence\" under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2 is unclear at best.</p>\n<p>Assessing these factors in total, we conclude that the \"limited character and gravity\" of the alleged error, its uncertain impact on the final sentence, the defendant's failure to raise the issue below, and the defendant's reliance on post-sentence proceedings suggest that there is no miscarriage of justice in enforcing the waiver. <i>See </i><i>Cardona-Diaz,</i> 524 F.3d at 24. Finding all of the <i>Teeter</i> factors satisfied, we conclude that the waiver is valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p>Lastly, González argues that, even if the waiver is valid and enforceable, this appeal does not come within its scope, because the district court did not sentence the defendant according to the plea agreement's \"terms and conditions.\" Instead, the district court acted with \"faulty memory\" in deviating from the sentencing recommendation, and hence the waiver never took effect.</p>\n<p>This argument has little traction. For one, the plea agreement called only for a <i>recommendation</i> to be made to the judge and, insofar as the agreement was presented to him, the recommendation was made. For another, the defendant's counsel was complicit in the mistake about the terms of the agreement, misquoting the sentencing recommendation to omit the fact that 108 months was to be the <i>minimum</i> sentence. Finally, the defendant obviously benefitted from the mistake. A district court that imposes a sentence lower than that recommended by the plea agreement, yet acquiesced to by both parties, cannot in any sense be said to have exceeded the \"terms and conditions\" of the agreement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Acosta-Roman,</i> 549 F.3d at 4 (district court exercising discretion that was contemplated by the plea agreement did not exceed the \"terms and conditions\" of that agreement).</p>\n<p>We therefore enforce the appeal waiver agreed to by the parties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>De León-Martínez</i></h2>\n<p>We apply the same <i>Teeter</i> analysis to the contentions of De León. De León does not dispute that the first two <i>Teeter</i> factors are met in his case. Rather, he argues that enforcing the waiver would be a miscarriage of justice, because the district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> court impermissibly inserted itself into the plea bargaining process, in violation of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c). De León points to three such incidents that ostensibly violate the Rule, but none withstands close scrutiny.</p>\n<p>First, during a status conference, the court inquired into the likelihood of a plea bargain and then stated, \"I'm available to discuss the case any time. You just let me know.\" We fail to see how such an innocuous comment constitutes impermissible intervention in the plea bargaining process, and in any event, \"a single brief remark during negotiations [has] been held not to constitute impermissible judicial participation in plea discussions.\" <i>United States v. Bradley,</i> 455 F.3d 453, 462 (4th Cir. 2006); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Uribe-Londono,</i> 409 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005) (holding there was no error when court \"simply inquired about the status of any plea negotiations\").</p>\n<p>Second, at the change of plea hearing, after the parties had reached a plea agreement, De León's counsel voiced his concern that, notwithstanding the plea agreement's recommendation of a 30-month minimum sentence, an impending change to the Guidelines might yield a lower sentencing calculation. In response, the court reiterated that it had final authority over the sentence, and indicated it would schedule the sentencing hearing for November 15, 2007, after any change to the Guidelines had taken effect.</p>\n<p>Informing the defendant about the court's authority and calendaring options after a plea agreement had been reached does not constitute \"participation\" in the plea bargaining process in any way. \"Because the plea negotiations between the parties had come to an end and the parties had signed a written plea agreement before the district judge was involved, it is hard to characterize the judge's comments as participation in any [plea] discussions.\" <i>United States v. Cannady,</i> 283 F.3d 641, 644 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Finally, at a hearing on De León's motion for new counsel conducted a week prior to sentencing, the court questioned the defendant about his dissatisfaction with counsel, reiterated that the court had ultimate sentencing authority over the defendant, and praised the defendant's counsel. Nothing forbids a court \"from questioning the defendant regarding the terms, consequences, and acceptance of the plea agreement or from providing the defendant with information relating to these matters,\" and we perceive no error here. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Carver,</i> 160 F.3d 1266, 1269 (10th Cir.1998); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Hicks,</i> 531 F.3d 49, 53-54 (1st Cir.2008) (court's assurances about counsel's competence did not amount to judicial participation in plea negotiations).</p>\n<p>Thus, we conclude that there is no miscarriage of justice, and we enforce the appeal waiver agreed to by the parties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Because both appellants agreed to valid and enforceable waivers of their rights to appeal their sentences, we will enforce the waivers and dismiss the appeals.</p>\n<p>APPEALS DISMISSED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The district court reduced the offense level calculation from the plea agreement following the November 1, 2007, amendments to the Guidelines.</p>\n<p>[2]  González also argues for a miscarriage of justice because the district court acted with a \"faulty memory\" in sentencing him to 97 months, a deviation from the sentencing recommendation in the plea agreement. Because, however, the plea agreement called for a minimum of 108 months, we fail to see how the defendant's windfall amounts to a miscarriage of justice. The better argument on this issuethough not by muchis that the deviation means the sentence is outside of the scope of the waiver, and therefore the waiver is inapplicable. We address this argument below.</p>\n<p>[3]  U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a)(1) defines a \"prior sentence\" as \"any sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt ... for conduct not part of the instant offense.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  Indeed, before the district court, González argued for something like the reverse: that because the \"instant offense\" included only the March and April 2006 drug sales detailed in the plea agreement, it predated the state court's imposition of probation on July 11, 2006, and therefore adding two points pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d) was error. The district court properly concluded that because the instant offense was a conspiracy, it did not end until the December 20, 2006, indictment, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Hernandez,</i> 541 F.3d 422, 425 (1st Cir.2008), at which point González had already been placed on probation by the commonwealth court.</p>\n\n</div>",

Appellant Roberto De León-Martínez (\"De León\") appeals a 24-month sentence he received for the same charge. We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a), and dismiss the appeals of both appellants, because each signed a valid and enforceable waiver of appeal in his respective plea agreement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Factual and Procedural Background</h2>\n<p>From approximately February 2005 until their indictment on December 20, 2006, González and De León participated in a conspiracy with ten others to distribute cocaine base (\"crack\") in Guayama, Puerto Rico. The two entered into plea agreements with the government and on September 18, 2007, González pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least 35, but less than 50, grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B), and 846. On the same date, De León pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least 4, but less than 5, grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846.</p>\n<p>The terms of González's plea agreement provided for a total offense level of 29. The parties did not stipulate to any criminal history category, but presumed a category of III, yielding a guideline range of 108-135 months' imprisonment. Under a section titled \"Sentencing Agreement,\" the agreement stated, \"The parties agree to recommend a term of imprisonment of one hundred eight (108) months or the lower end of the applicable guideline range, whichever is greater.\"</p>\n<p>In calculating the applicable criminal history category, the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSI\") for González noted that on July 11, 2006, González had been sentenced by the Superior Court in Puerto Rico to three consecutive five-year terms of imprisonment for drug arrests dating from November 4, 2004, August 1, 2005, and January 30, 2006. The commonwealth court had suspended the sentences and placed González on probation. Concluding that González was therefore on probation for a prior sentence at the time he committed the instant offense, the PSI added two points to González's criminal history score pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d), resulting in a criminal history category of II.</p>\n<p>At his sentencing hearing, González challenged the PSI's recommendation of a criminal history category of II, arguing that because the two specific drug transactions named in the plea agreement occurred on March 2 and April 11, 2006, they predated the state court's imposition of probation on July 11, 2006, and thus two points should not have been added under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d). The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p>The court then noted that with a criminal history category of II, and a total offense level of 27,<sup>[1]</sup> the Guidelines recommended a range of 78 to 97 months. At that point, González's counsel stated that the plea agreement called for a sentence of \"108 [months] or the upper end of the applicable guideline.\" In fact, the sentencing agreement called for 108 months or the lower end of the applicable guideline, whichever was <i>greater</i>meaning 108 months minimum. Neither party noted or objected to the misstatement, and the district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> court sentenced González to 97 months.</p>\n<p>As for De León, the terms of his plea agreement yielded a total offense level of 19. The parties agreed to neither a criminal history category nor a particular guideline sentence, agreeing only to \"argue for a sentence within the applicable guideline range.\"</p>\n<p>The PSI calculated a criminal history category of I, leading to a guideline range of 24 to 30 months. The district court sentenced De León to 24 months' imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Both plea agreements, for González and for De León, contained a waiver of the right to appeal the judgment and sentence, providing, \"The defendant hereby agrees that if this Honorable Court accepts this agreement and sentences him according to its terms and conditions, defendant waives and surrenders his right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case.\"</p>\n<p>González nonetheless appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court sentenced him on the basis of \"faulty memory\" and under an incorrect calculation of his criminal history category. De León also appeals, arguing that the district court impermissibly participated in plea bargain discussions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.

Relevant factors include \"the clarity of the alleged error, its character and gravity, its impact on the defendant, any possible prejudice to the government, and the extent to which the defendant acquiesced in the result.\" <i>Gil-Quezada,</i> 445 F.3d at 37 (citing <i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 26).</p>\n<p>Several of those factors militate against invoking the exception in this case.</p>\n<p>First, González failed to raise this issue before the district court, despite having ample opportunity to detail the reach and scope of the state conviction.<sup>[4]</sup> We are wary of invoking the miscarriage-of-justice exception when the defendant could have raised an argument below but did not. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cardona-Diaz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203248\"><a href=\"/opinion/203248/united-states-v-cardona-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 23-24 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Edelen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1427387\"><a href=\"/opinion/1427387/united-states-v-edelen/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 87 (1st Cir.2008) (\"If the mere fact that a defendant has arguments he could potentially invoke on appeal were allowed to invalidate a waiver, then appellate waivers would become meaningless.\").</p>\n<p>Second, González seeks to anchor his new claim to proceedings in commonwealth court that postdate the sentencing in this case-specifically, a recent state court probation revocation hearing that concluded the commonwealth and federal charges were the \"same.\" However, \"post-sentencing maneuvers ordinarily cannot be used as history-altering devices,\" and thus this court strongly disfavors granting relief on the basis of a record not before the district court. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Mateo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199671\"><a href=\"/opinion/199671/united-states-v-mateo/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>Third, it is debatableif not doubtful whether a different calculation of González's criminal history category would have affected the final sentence. Because González failed to raise this argument below, the plain error standard is incorporated into our assessment of the miscarriage-of-justice element. Thus González must show not merely that the error \"<i>could have</i> changed the outcome,\" but rather <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> that \"the error <i>must have</i> done so.\" <i>United States v. Albanese,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199924\"><a href=\"/opinion/199924/united-states-v-albanese/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span>, 229 n. 1 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>United States v. Sposito,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197213\"><a href=\"/opinion/197213/united-states-v-sposito/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1042</span></a></span>, 1049-50 (1st Cir. 1997)) (applying plain error standard to alleged miscalculation of criminal history category).</p>\n<p>In this case, the sentencing agreement called for a minimum of 108 months' imprisonmentregardless of the final criminal history category. Moreover, \"we have recognized that when parties agree that the government will recommend a certain sentence, they do so with the understanding that it is likely the district court will accept the recommendation.\" <i>Cardona-Diaz,</i> 524 F.3d at 24. Therefore, even if the district court had calculated a different criminal history category, \"we cannot be certain that the court would not have imposed a similar sentence anyway.\" <i>Id.</i> Indeed, it may have imposed a <i>higher</i> sentence in accord with the plea agreement's recommendation of a 108-month minimum. González's failure to show the probability of a different sentence militates against finding a miscarriage of justice. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Finally, we would also note that, on the merits of González's challenge, the July 11, 2006, commonwealth court sentence included a five-year term of imprisonment for marijuana charges following a November 4, 2004, arrest in Guayama, which predates the beginning of the federal conspiracy by three months. Thus, whether the probation was properly counted as a \"prior sentence\" under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2 is unclear at best.</p>\n<p>Assessing these factors in total, we conclude that the \"limited character and gravity\" of the alleged error, its uncertain impact on the final sentence, the defendant's failure to raise the issue below, and the defendant's reliance on post-sentence proceedings suggest that there is no miscarriage of justice in enforcing the waiver. <i>See </i><i>Cardona-Diaz,</i> 524 F.3d at 24. Finding all of the <i>Teeter</i> factors satisfied, we conclude that the waiver is valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p>Lastly, González argues that, even if the waiver is valid and enforceable, this appeal does not come within its scope, because the district court did not sentence the defendant according to the plea agreement's \"terms and conditions.\" Instead, the district court acted with \"faulty memory\" in deviating from the sentencing recommendation, and hence the waiver never took effect.</p>\n<p>This argument has little traction. For one, the plea agreement called only for a <i>recommendation</i> to be made to the judge and, insofar as the agreement was presented to him, the recommendation was made. For another, the defendant's counsel was complicit in the mistake about the terms of the agreement, misquoting the sentencing recommendation to omit the fact that 108 months was to be the <i>minimum</i> sentence. Finally, the defendant obviously benefitted from the mistake. A district court that imposes a sentence lower than that recommended by the plea agreement, yet acquiesced to by both parties, cannot in any sense be said to have exceeded the \"terms and conditions\" of the agreement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Acosta-Roman,</i> 549 F.3d at 4 (district court exercising discretion that was contemplated by the plea agreement did not exceed the \"terms and conditions\" of that agreement).</p>\n<p>We therefore enforce the appeal waiver agreed to by the parties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>De León-Martínez</i></h2>\n<p>We apply the same <i>Teeter</i> analysis to the contentions of De León. De León does not dispute that the first two <i>Teeter</i> factors are met in his case. Rather, he argues that enforcing the waiver would be a miscarriage of justice, because the district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> court impermissibly inserted itself into the plea bargaining process, in violation of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c). De León points to three such incidents that ostensibly violate the Rule, but none withstands close scrutiny.</p>\n<p>First, during a status conference, the court inquired into the likelihood of a plea bargain and then stated, \"I'm available to discuss the case any time. You just let me know.\" We fail to see how such an innocuous comment constitutes impermissible intervention in the plea bargaining process, and in any event, \"a single brief remark during negotiations [has] been held not to constitute impermissible judicial participation in plea discussions.\" <i>United States v. Bradley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795087\"><a href=\"/opinion/795087/united-states-v-tavon-bradley-united-states-of-america-v-solomon-levi/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 462 (4th Cir. 2006); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Uribe-Londono,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201592\"><a href=\"/opinion/201592/united-states-v-uribe-londono/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2005) (holding there was no error when court \"simply inquired about the status of any plea negotiations\").</p>\n<p>Second, at the change of plea hearing, after the parties had reached a plea agreement, De León's counsel voiced his concern that, notwithstanding the plea agreement's recommendation of a 30-month minimum sentence, an impending change to the Guidelines might yield a lower sentencing calculation. In response, the court reiterated that it had final authority over the sentence, and indicated it would schedule the sentencing hearing for November 15, 2007, after any change to the Guidelines had taken effect.</p>\n<p>Informing the defendant about the court's authority and calendaring options after a plea agreement had been reached does not constitute \"participation\" in the plea bargaining process in any way. \"Because the plea negotiations between the parties had come to an end and the parties had signed a written plea agreement before the district judge was involved, it is hard to characterize the judge's comments as participation in any [plea] discussions.\" <i>United States v. Cannady,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776918\"><a href=\"/opinion/776918/united-states-v-carmichael-cannady-aka-stokey/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, 644 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Finally, at a hearing on De León's motion for new counsel conducted a week prior to sentencing, the court questioned the defendant about his dissatisfaction with counsel, reiterated that the court had ultimate sentencing authority over the defendant, and praised the defendant's counsel. Nothing forbids a court \"from questioning the defendant regarding the terms, consequences, and acceptance of the plea agreement or from providing the defendant with information relating to these matters,\" and we perceive no error here. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Carver,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759281\"><a href=\"/opinion/759281/united-states-v-tony-lenard-carver/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1266</span></a></span>, 1269 (10th Cir.1998); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Hicks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203345\"><a href=\"/opinion/203345/united-states-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 53-54 (1st Cir.2008) (court's assurances about counsel's competence did not amount to judicial participation in plea negotiations).</p>\n<p>Thus, we conclude that there is no miscarriage of justice, and we enforce the appeal waiver agreed to by the parties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Because both appellants agreed to valid and enforceable waivers of their rights to appeal their sentences, we will enforce the waivers and dismiss the appeals.</p>\n<p>APPEALS DISMISSED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The district court reduced the offense level calculation from the plea agreement following the November 1, 2007, amendments to the Guidelines.</p>\n<p>[2]  González also argues for a miscarriage of justice because the district court acted with a \"faulty memory\" in sentencing him to 97 months, a deviation from the sentencing recommendation in the plea agreement. Because, however, the plea agreement called for a minimum of 108 months, we fail to see how the defendant's windfall amounts to a miscarriage of justice. The better argument on this issuethough not by muchis that the deviation means the sentence is outside of the scope of the waiver, and therefore the waiver is inapplicable. We address this argument below.</p>\n<p>[3]  U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a)(1) defines a \"prior sentence\" as \"any sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt ... for conduct not part of the instant offense.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  Indeed, before the district court, González argued for something like the reverse: that because the \"instant offense\" included only the March and April 2006 drug sales detailed in the plea agreement, it predated the state court's imposition of probation on July 11, 2006, and therefore adding two points pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d) was error. The district court properly concluded that because the instant offense was a conspiracy, it did not end until the December 20, 2006, indictment, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Hernandez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203464\"><a href=\"/opinion/203464/united-states-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span>, 425 (1st Cir.2008), at which point González had already been placed on probation by the commonwealth court.</p>\n\n</div>",
