José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                       Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                     Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     James M.

Upon review of the record and the briefs\n\n(including appellant's pro se supplemental brief), we conclude that\n\nthe facts and legal issues have been adequately presented and that\n\nthe decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral\n\nargument.          See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2)(C); 1st Cir. Loc. R.\n\n34(a)(2)(C).          Appellant    pled     guilty   to    two     separate     drug\n\nconspiracies.        In connection with one of these charges (#00-332),\n\nappellant stipulated to the applicable guidelines, including a 4-\n\nlevel leadership adjustment under § 3B1.1(a), and to a 168-month\n\nrecommended prison sentence.            Accepting the parties' stipulations,\n\nthe district court adopted the guideline calculations set forth in\n\ntheir plea agreement and imposed the 168-month sentence to which\n\nthe parties had agreed.           Appellant now says that he should have\n\nreceived a lower sentence.\n\n              In     essence,    appellant      contends    that    the    4-level\n\nleadership adjustment that the court imposed lacked an adequate\n\nfactual basis because appellant's admissions at his change of plea\n\nhearing were too vague to support it and his stipulations did not\n\nconstitute admissions.           In addition, appellant contends that his\n\nsentence violates Blakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531, 2537\n\n(2004)(holding that \"the 'statutory maximum' for Apprendi purposes\n\nis the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of\n\nthe   facts    reflected    in    the    jury   verdict    or   admitted   by   the\n\ndefendant.\")(citations omitted, emphasis in original).\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f             Although appellant protested the leadership adjustment at\n\nhis sentencing he did not suggest that the facts did not support\n\nit.       Moreover,   appellant's   counsel   effectively      conceded   that\n\nappellant did not have a valid legal objection to the adjustment.\n\nArguably, the claims appellant raises now have been waived.                See\n\nUnited States v. Stearns, 387 F.3d 104, 107-08 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nNevertheless, we review them for plain error.            See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Savarese, 385 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir. 2004); United States\n\nv. Solares, 236 F.3d 24, 25 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n             The district court did not commit plain error by applying\n\nthe leadership adjustment.          The record discloses that appellant\n\nadmitted that he owned the drug point at which he \"supervised\" at\n\nleast five people, specifically, his codefendants and a cooperating\n\ninformant, and that he was responsible for the sale of over five\n\nkilograms     of   cocaine   over    the   course   of   the     conspiracy.1\n\nAppellant's claim that he did not admit that he supervised anyone\n\nis belied by the record of the Rule 11 hearing.             Appellant only\n\ndisagreed with the prosecutor's statement that he personally sold\n\n26 grams of cocaine to an undercover officer.            Appellant did not\n\n\n\n      1\n        Although the prosecutor did not specify at the Rule 11\nhearing that the persons that appellant supervised were his\ncodefendants and a cooperating informant, the presentence report\n(PSR) did, and appellant did not object to it.         Appellant is\ntherefore bound by the PSR's findings.        See United States v.\nMedina, 167 F.3d 77, 81 (1st Cir. 1999)(\"a court may accept, as true\nand accurate, any unchallenged fact contained in the PSR[]\")(citing\nUnited States v. Rosales, 19 F.3d 763, 770 (1st Cir. 1994)).\n\n                                     -3-\n\fdisagree with the prosecutor's claim that he supervised at least\n\nfive others and that he owned the drug point.                      The fact that\n\nappellant stipulated to the leadership adjustment and admitted\n\nfacts that made its application plausible is enough to defeat his\n\nclaim, see United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 28 (1st Cir. 2001),\n\nespecially where appellant's counsel conceded that he lacked a\n\nvalid objection to the adjustment.              As we said in Teeter, id.:\n\n              Should the [sentencing] court decide to accept\n              and   act   upon  factual   stipulations   for\n              sentencing purposes, the parties usually will\n              be firmly bound. This general rule will apply\n              when, for example, a defendant stipulates to a\n              matter of fact or to the applicability of a\n              sentencing guideline (the legal meaning of\n              which is pellucid) to the unique facts of her\n              case. After all, the defendant knows what she\n              has done, and has little cause for complaint\n              if the district court takes her at her word.\n\n              The fact that appellant's admissions adequately support\n\nthe leadership adjustment is enough to remove this case from\n\nBlakely's potential reach.         See, e.g., Stearns, 387 F.3d at 107\n\n(\"Blakely      does     not    apply      to     'facts     admitted      by    the\n\ndefendant[,]'\")(citations omitted); Savarese, 385 F.3d at 22.                   And\n\nsince it is obvious that the district court applied the adjustment\n\nbased on      appellant's     admissions       and   stipulations,     appellant's\n\nsuggestion that the district court's sentencing findings were not\n\nspecific enough to support the adjustment also fails.                   See United\n\nStates   v.    Garcia   Morales,    382    F.3d      12,   20   (1st   Cir.   2004).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fAccordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.   See\n\nLocal Rule 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                              -5-\n\f",
