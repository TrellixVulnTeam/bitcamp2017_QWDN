McCarthy on brief pro se.\n     Corey L. Farrell, Office of Immigration Litigation, Gregory G.\nKatsas, Assistant Attorney General, and Greg D. Mack, Senior\nLitigation Counsel, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                             January 9, 2009\n\f             Per Curiam.    Pro se petitioner Dennis A. McCarthy seeks\n\nreview of a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision upholding\n\na removal order issued by an immigration judge.               McCarthy was\n\nordered removed to Jamaica on the ground that he was an alien\n\nsubject to removal because of his conviction for a federal crime\n\nthat qualified as an aggravated felony and a controlled substance\n\noffense.1     See 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (providing for the\n\nremoval of aliens \"convicted of an aggravated felony\"); id. (B)(i)\n\n(same for aliens convicted of, inter alia, federal controlled\n\nsubstance     violations    \"other   than   a   single   offense   involving\n\npossession for one's own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana\").\n\n             Although we lack jurisdiction to review removal orders\n\nagainst criminal aliens, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C), we have\n\nlimited     jurisdiction   to   consider    \"constitutional   questions   or\n\nquestions of law.\"         Id. § 1252(a)(2)(D).      On appeal, McCarthy\n\nraises such questions, and we review them de novo. See Abou-Haidar\n\nv. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 206, 207 (1st Cir. 2006) (so stating with\n\nrespect to the question whether an alien has been naturalized);\n\naccord Julce v. Mukasey, 530 F.3d 30, 33 n.3 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(whether a conviction constitutes an aggravated felony); Urena-\n\nRamirez v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 51, 53 (1st Cir. 2003) (whether a\n\n\n     1\n      On November 4, 2008, the government filed a notice of intent\nto remove McCarthy \"on or after November 20, 2008.\"      Given the\ncollateral consequences of being removed as an aggravated felon,\nMcCarthy's removal would not moot his petition for review. Leitao\nv. Reno, 311 F.3d 453, 456 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                     -2-\n\fconviction constitutes a controlled substance offense);             González-\n\nMesías v. Mukasey, 529 F.3d 62, 64 (1st Cir. 2008) (constitutional\n\nquestions).      Finding no merit in any of McCarthy's arguments, we\n\ndeny the petition in part and otherwise dismiss it for lack of\n\njurisdiction for the following reasons.\n\n            1. McCarthy's strongest point in support of his argument\n\nthat he is a United States national--and not an alien subject to\n\nremoval--is that he is a lawful permanent resident who swore\n\nallegiance       to   this   country    and   filed   an   application       for\n\ncitizenship. But McCarthy's failure to complete the naturalization\n\nprocess dooms his argument.        See Abou-Haidar, supra, 437 F.3d at\n\n207-08.    We have rejected the reasoning of the Fourth Circuit case\n\nthat McCarthy relies on, id. at 207 n.4 (disagreeing with United\n\nStates v. Morin, 80 F.3d 124, 126 (4th Cir. 1996)), and the Fourth\n\nCircuit itself has concluded that Morin is no longer authoritative.\n\nSee Fernandez v. Keisler, 502 F.3d 337, 347-48 (4th Cir. 2007)\n\n(majority opinion), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 65 (2008).\n\n            2.    McCarthy's conviction for possessing with intent to\n\ndistribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1)--for\n\nwhich he received a 121-month prison term, as his written criminal\n\njudgment     shows--satisfied     the    prerequisites     in   8   U.S.C.     §\n\n1101(a)(43)(B), and so constitutes an aggravated felony.              See id.\n\n(defining an \"aggravated felony\" to include \"a drug trafficking\n\ncrime (as defined in section 924(c) of Title 18)\"); 18 U.S.C. §\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f924(c) (defining \"drug trafficking crime\" to mean \"any felony\n\npunishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 801 et\n\nseq.)\").   McCarthy's arguments to the contrary are foreclosed by\n\nour precedent.        See Conteh v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 45, 59, 62 (1st\n\nCir.   2006)    (majority     opinion)       (concluding   that   in     removal\n\nproceedings the government need only show that an alien has been\n\nconvicted of a crime involving \"every element\" of the relevant §\n\n1101(a)(43) offense and may rely on the conviction records to meet\n\nits burden of proof), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 3003 (2007); Julce,\n\nsupra, 530 F.3d at 35-36 (concluding that an alien in removal\n\nproceedings     has     the   burden   of     showing   that   the     marijuana\n\nmisdemeanor described in 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(4) applies; and that if\n\nhe fails to meet his burden, then a § 841(a)(1) conviction is\n\ndeemed \"punishable as a felony\" under § 841(b)(1)(D)).\n\n           3.   The government bears the burden of proving that the\n\nstatutory controlled substance exception for \"a single offense\n\ninvolving possession for one's own use of 30 grams or less of\n\nmarijuana\" does not apply. Medina v. Ashcroft, 393 F.3d 1063, 1065\n\nn. 5 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing Sandoval v. INS, 240 F.3d 577, 581\n\n(7th Cir. 2001)).       Contrary to McCarthy's contention, it satisfied\n\nthat burden by submitting McCarthy's conviction records documenting\n\nhis 121-month sentence.        His sentence would have been capped at 60\n\nmonths if his offense had involved \"30 grams or less\" of marijuana.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fSee § 841(b)(1)(D) (providing for a statutory maximum of 5 years\n\nfor offenses involving \"less than 50 kilograms\" of marijuana).\n\n           4.   For    present   purposes,   we    assume   that   McCarthy\n\nproperly   exhausted    his   constitutional      and   international   law\n\narguments opposing his removal on the ground that it would deny him\n\nhis right to \"familial integrity.\"           See Royal Siam Corp. v.\n\nChertoff, 484 F.3d 139, 144 (1st Cir. 2007) (indicating that this\n\ncourt has sometimes bypassed problematical jurisdictional questions\n\nin immigration cases where \"precedent clearly adumbrates the result\n\non the merits\").       A recent decision by this court shows that\n\nMcCarthy cannot prevail on his claims.             See Payne-Barahona v.\n\nGonzales, 474 F.3d 1, 2-4 (1st Cir. 2007) (concluding that an\n\n\"otherwise valid deportation\" does not violate constitutional due\n\nprocess, that the international conventions at issue here do not\n\nhave \"the force of domestic law,\" and that, in any event, their\n\nconflicting provisions would give way to the \"clear intent of\n\nCongress\" found in the immigration statute's removal provisions).\n\n           The petition for review is denied in part and otherwise\n\ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f",
