We have therefore substituted\nAttorney General Gonzáles for John Ashcroft as the respondent. See\nFed. R. Civ. 25(d)(1); Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f            Per Curiam.    Mohammed S. Alam, a native and citizen of\n\nBangladesh, petitions for review of a decision of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA) affirming the denial by an Immigration\n\nJudge (IJ) of his application for political asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and relief pursuant to the United Nations Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (\"CAT\").      The petition for review is denied.\n\n            As an initial matter, we find no abuse of discretion in\n\nthe BIA's insistence upon compliance with the requirements of\n\nMatter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff'd 857 F.2d 10\n\n(1st Cir. 1988), as a precondition to Alam's pursuit of his claim\n\nof ineffective assistance of counsel.        Betouche v. Ashcroft, 357\n\nF.3d 147, 149 n.2 (1st Cir. 2004) (BIA has discretion to insist on\n\ncompliance with Lozada prerequisites).        Alam's failure to comply\n\nwith any of the three Lozada prerequisites hardly constitutes a\n\nstrong basis to argue otherwise.         And, we find neither abuse of\n\ndiscretion nor error of law in the BIA's further conclusion that\n\nAlam had failed to establish prejudice from his counsel's claimed\n\ndeficiencies.\n\n            In reviewing a BIA denial of asylum, we determine whether\n\nthe decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record,\n\nupholding    the   BIA's   fact-based    determination   of   an   alien's\n\nentitlement to asylum unless \"'any reasonable adjudicator would be\n\ncompelled to conclude to the contrary.'\"       Bocova v. Gonzales, 412\n\nF.3d 257, 262 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)).\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fUpon our review of the record under this standard, we find easily\n\nsustainable the BIA's determination that the evidence does not\n\nestablish Alam's eligibility for political asylum.      In brief, as\n\nnoted by the BIA, Alam points to a single assault in 1988 by\n\nmembers of a party opposed to the ruling party (of which Alam was\n\na member) for which Alam required some (not further described)\n\nmedical attention.     Although Alam left Bangladesh the following\n\nyear, he has voluntarily returned to Bangladesh since then, if only\n\nbriefly, but without incident.         Alam's additional evidence of\n\npersecution of family members was, as recited by the BIA, very\n\nsummary.\n\n            Alam makes no further particularized claim with respect\n\nto his requests for withholding of removal and relief under the\n\nCAT.     In any event, as Alam's asylum claim fails, so does the\n\nwithholding claim, as it engenders an even more stringent burden of\n\nproof.     See Settenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93-94 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).    Substantial evidence supports the denial of the CAT claim.\n\n            Alam's request for oral argument is denied.\n\n            The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f",
