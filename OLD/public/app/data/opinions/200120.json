Rivero-Cabañas and Julio\n\nFigueroa-Romero challenge the district court's dismissal of their\n\nmotions brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.      Finding no error, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n          In    April   1994,   Rivero-Cabañas,   Figueroa-Romero,   and\n\nfifteen co-defendants were named in a ten-count indictment alleging\nvarious drug related offenses.     Rivero-Cabañas and Figueroa-Romero\n\nwere charged in six counts of the indictment.1           Roughly a year\n\nlater, after initially pleading not guilty on all counts, both\nappellants pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess\nwith   intent   to   distribute    cocaine,   pursuant   to   21   U.S.C.\n§§ 841(a)(1) and 846 (Count One), and one count of aiding and\n\nabetting the use and carrying of firearms during the commission of\na drug trafficking crime, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) (Count\n\n\n\n\n1\n   The indictment charged them with: conspiracy to possess with\nintent to distribute cocaine and marijuana, in violation of 21\nU.S.C. §§ 846 and 841(a)(1) (Count One); attempting to import into\nthe United States from a place outside thereof approximately 3000\npounds of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 952, 960 and 963\nand 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Count Three); use of a firearm in a drug related\noffense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2\n(Count Four); importation into the United States from a place\noutside thereof approximately 629 kilograms of cocaine, in\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 952 and 960 and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Count\nFive); use of a firearm in a drug related offense, in violation of\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Count Six); and possession\nwith intent to distribute approximately 629 kilograms (gross\nweight) of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18\nU.S.C. § 2 (Count Seven). In addition, Rivero-Cabañas was charged\nwith possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of\n21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Count Two).\n\n                                   -3-\n\fSix). In exchange for these guilty pleas, the government agreed to\n\ndismiss the remaining counts against them.\n\n           On July 7, 1995, the district court sentenced both\nappellants. Rivero-Cabañas was sentenced to a term of imprisonment\n\nof 168 months as to Count One and sixty months as to Count Six,\n\nwith the terms to be served consecutively.         Figueroa-Romero was\nsentenced to a term of imprisonment of 144 months as to Count One\n\nand sixty months as to Count Six, also with the terms to be served\n\nconsecutively.    Appellants sought review on direct appeal.          On\n\nappeal, Figueroa-Romero petitioned for and was denied appointed\n\ncounsel.    On May 21, 1997, this court affirmed the convictions.\n\nSee United States v. Figueroa-Romero, 114 F.3d 1170 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(unpublished).\n           In late 1999, appellants filed separate motions to vacate\n\ntheir sentences under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.      The motions were referred\n\nto magistrate judges, who both issued recommendations to deny\nrelief.     The   district   court,    adopting   the   recommendations,\n\ndismissed appellants' cases.    This timely appeal followed.\n\n                                  II.\n\n           Appellants' § 2255 motions attack their guilty pleas on\n\nCount Six of the indictment, charging a violation of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 924.     Both appellants argue that they were denied effective\nassistance of counsel inasmuch as: (1) their attorneys failed to\n\nargue the correct legal standard applicable to aiding and abetting\nliability under § 924(c)(1); and, (2) their attorneys did not\n\nchallenge the government's proffer at sentencing and failed to\n\n                                 -4-\n\frequest an evidentiary hearing in order to compel the government to\n\nestablish that appellants satisfied a required element of the\n\noffense.      In addition, Figueroa-Romero argues that he was denied\ndue process because he was not given court-appointed counsel for\n\nhis direct appeals.\n\n              When faced with an appeal from the denial of a § 2255\nmotion, we review the district court's legal determinations de novo\n\nand its factual findings for clear error.                     Familia-Consoro v.\n\nUnited States, 160 F.3d 761, 764-65 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                         A.\n\n              The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the\n\nright to effective assistance of counsel, Lema v. United States,\n987   F.2d    48,    51   (1st   Cir.    1993),   which   includes      effective\nrepresentation during the plea process, Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S.\n\n52, 56 (1985). In order for the appellants' ineffective assistance\nof counsel claims to prevail, they must show that (1) considering\nall   the     circumstances,     counsel's      performance      fell   below   an\n\nobjective standard of reasonableness, and (2) there is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel's unprofessional error, the\nresult   of    the   proceedings        would   have   been    different.       See\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).\n              To satisfy the first prong, appellants must overcome a\n\"strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide\n\nrange of reasonable professional assistance.\"                 Id. at 689.   Thus,\nthe errors of counsel must be \"so serious that counsel was not\n\nfunctioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth\n\n                                         -5-\n\fAmendment.\"    Id. at 687.   \"Tactical decisions, whether wise or\n\nunwise, successful or unsuccessful, cannot ordinarily form the\n\nbasis of a claim of ineffective assistance.\"        United States v.\nOrtiz-Oliveras, 717 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 1983).       And under the\n\nsecond prong, even where unprofessional error during the plea\n\nprocess is shown, no relief is available absent demonstration of a\n\"reasonable    probability   that,    but   for   counsel's   errors,\n\n[appellants] would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted\n\non going to trial.\"   Hill, 474 U.S. at 59.\n\n          We are convinced that neither error nor prejudice can be\n\nestablished on the facts here.        Appellants' various legal and\n\nfactual arguments boil down to the same basic contention: that the\n\nfacts which the appellants admitted were insufficient to support a\nguilty plea for aiding and abetting the use and carrying of\n\nfirearms during the commission of a drug trafficking crime, under\n\n§ 924(c)(1).   On the legal front, appellants complain that their\nattorneys should have argued to the court that the knowledge\n\nelement necessary to support a conviction under § 924(c)(1) is that\n\nof \"practical certainty,\" see United States v. Torres-Maldonado, 14\n\nF.3d 95, 103 (1st Cir. 1994), rather than a more lenient vicarious\n\nliability standard, see Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640,\n\n645-48 (1946) (holding that a conspirator may be held vicariously\n\nliable for a substantive crime committed by a co-conspirator if\n\nthat crime is reasonably foreseeable and committed in furtherance\n\nof the conspiracy).   On the factual front, appellants argue that\n\nthe conduct to which they admitted did not satisfy the higher\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fstandard and that their attorneys should have forced the government\n\nto   adduce    proof   in   an   evidentiary   hearing    establishing   that\n\nappellants knew to a practical certainty that their accomplices\nwould be using guns during the commission of the drug crimes.\n\n              In this case, it would be academic for us to address the\n\nquestion of whether the \"practical certainty\" or Pinkerton standard\n\nshould govern convictions under § 924(c)(1), as we think there were\n\ngood tactical reasons -- well within the range of acceptable\n\nprofessional assistance -- for appellants' attorneys not to pursue\n\nsuch arguments during the plea proceedings.                 In exchange for\n\nappellants' guilty pleas on two counts in the indictment, the\n\ngovernment agreed to dismiss the remaining counts.              Appellants'\n\nattorneys were quite successful in securing favorable plea bargains\nfor their clients.          A tactical decision not to jeopardize that\n\nbargain is therefore entirely defensible.                Had the pleas been\n\nwithdrawn, the government would have been free to seek convictions\non all of the counts charged in the indictment.              And if proven,\n\nthose counts would have carried stiff additional penalties for the\n\nappellants.\n\n              As for the showing of prejudice, appellants have barely\n\nalleged, much less provided proof, that absent their attorneys'\n\nsupposed errors they would have withdrawn their guilty pleas and\n\ninsisted on going to trial.           We therefore affirm the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that no claim for ineffective assistance has\n\nbeen shown.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f                                         B.\n\n            Figueroa-Romero        claims      that     he    was   denied       his\n\nconstitutional rights of due process and effective assistance of\n\ncounsel when he was forced to proceed on direct appeal without the\n\nassistance of counsel.        The record is clear that Figueroa-Romero\n\nfiled a motion with this Court requesting the appointment of\n\ncounsel after his request for the withdrawal of trial counsel had\n\nbeen granted.         This Court informed Figueroa-Romero that he must\n\nfile a financial affidavit, as well as a motion to proceed in forma\n\npauperis with the district court, before seeking appointment of\ncounsel on appeal. Although Figueroa-Romero claims that he drafted\n\nand filed the required documentation, no docket entry in the\ndistrict court confirms this.\n            It is well settled that an indigent defendant shall not\n\nbe denied effective assistance of counsel on appeal.                   See Douglas\n\nv. California, 372 U.S. 353, 355 (1963).              To that end, the Criminal\nJustice Act provides for the appointment of counsel for a criminal\n\ndefendant    who       is   financially       unable     to   obtain     adequate\nrepresentation at any stage of the proceedings, including appeal.\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3006A(a) & (c).          Although the Criminal Justice Act\n\nrequires the district court to conduct an \"appropriate inquiry\"\ninto the financial status of a defendant who seeks appointed\ncounsel,    id.   §    3006A(b),   the    applicant      bears   the    burden   of\n\npersuading the court that he is financially unable to obtain\ncounsel, see United States v. Harris, 707 F.2d 653, 660 (2d Cir.\n\n1983). Appellate courts employ the \"clearly erroneous\" standard in\n\n                                      -8-\n\freviewing    the    trial    court's    determination         as    to     whether   an\n\napplicant qualifies for counsel.             Id.\n\n            The district court found that Figueroa-Romero failed to\ncomply with this Court's order to file in district court a motion\n\nto proceed in forma pauperis prior to requesting appointed counsel.\n\nWe   find   no   basis     for   upsetting    the    district       court's   ruling.\nAlthough    Figueroa-Romero        claims     that    he    filed    the    necessary\n\ndocuments in district court, we only have his word and a copy of\n\nwhat he claims he filed to prove that he did.                This is insufficient\n\nto   establish     clear    error,   and     we    detect   no     other    basis    for\n\nupsetting the district court's ruling on Figueroa-Romero's claim.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f",

In order for the appellants' ineffective assistance\nof counsel claims to prevail, they must show that (1) considering\nall   the     circumstances,     counsel's      performance      fell   below   an\n\nobjective standard of reasonableness, and (2) there is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel's unprofessional error, the\nresult   of    the   proceedings        would   have   been    different.

Thus,\nthe errors of counsel must be \"so serious that counsel was not\n\nfunctioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth\n\n                                         -5-\n\fAmendment.\"    Id. at 687.   \"Tactical decisions, whether wise or\n\nunwise, successful or unsuccessful, cannot ordinarily form the\n\nbasis of a claim of ineffective assistance.\"        United States v.\nOrtiz-Oliveras, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"424767\"><a href=\"/opinion/424767/united-states-v-andres-carlos-ortiz-oliveras/\"><span class=\"volume\">717</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3-4 (1st Cir. 1983).

Appellants' various legal and\n\nfactual arguments boil down to the same basic contention: that the\n\nfacts which the appellants admitted were insufficient to support a\nguilty plea for aiding and abetting the use and carrying of\n\nfirearms during the commission of a drug trafficking crime, under\n\n§ 924(c)(1).   On the legal front, appellants complain that their\nattorneys should have argued to the court that the knowledge\n\nelement necessary to support a conviction under § 924(c)(1) is that\n\nof \"practical certainty,\" see United States v.

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104316\"><a href=\"/opinion/104316/pinkerton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n645-48 (1946) (holding that a conspirator may be held vicariously\n\nliable for a substantive crime committed by a co-conspirator if\n\nthat crime is reasonably foreseeable and committed in furtherance\n\nof the conspiracy).   On the factual front, appellants argue that\n\nthe conduct to which they admitted did not satisfy the higher\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fstandard and that their attorneys should have forced the government\n\nto   adduce    proof   in   an   evidentiary   hearing    establishing   that\n\nappellants knew to a practical certainty that their accomplices\nwould be using guns during the commission of the drug crimes.\n\n              In this case, it would be academic for us to address the\n\nquestion of whether the \"practical certainty\" or Pinkerton standard\n\nshould govern convictions under § 924(c)(1), as we think there were\n\ngood tactical reasons -- well within the range of acceptable\n\nprofessional assistance -- for appellants' attorneys not to pursue\n\nsuch arguments during the plea proceedings.                 In exchange for\n\nappellants' guilty pleas on two counts in the indictment, the\n\ngovernment agreed to dismiss the remaining counts.              Appellants'\n\nattorneys were quite successful in securing favorable plea bargains\nfor their clients.          A tactical decision not to jeopardize that\n\nbargain is therefore entirely defensible.                Had the pleas been\n\nwithdrawn, the government would have been free to seek convictions\non all of the counts charged in the indictment.              And if proven,\n\nthose counts would have carried stiff additional penalties for the\n\nappellants.\n\n              As for the showing of prejudice, appellants have barely\n\nalleged, much less provided proof, that absent their attorneys'\n\nsupposed errors they would have withdrawn their guilty pleas and\n\ninsisted on going to trial.           We therefore affirm the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that no claim for ineffective assistance has\n\nbeen shown.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f                                         B.\n\n            Figueroa-Romero        claims      that     he    was   denied       his\n\nconstitutional rights of due process and effective assistance of\n\ncounsel when he was forced to proceed on direct appeal without the\n\nassistance of counsel.        The record is clear that Figueroa-Romero\n\nfiled a motion with this Court requesting the appointment of\n\ncounsel after his request for the withdrawal of trial counsel had\n\nbeen granted.         This Court informed Figueroa-Romero that he must\n\nfile a financial affidavit, as well as a motion to proceed in forma\n\npauperis with the district court, before seeking appointment of\ncounsel on appeal. Although Figueroa-Romero claims that he drafted\n\nand filed the required documentation, no docket entry in the\ndistrict court confirms this.\n            It is well settled that an indigent defendant shall not\n\nbe denied effective assistance of counsel on appeal.

Although the Criminal Justice Act\n\nrequires the district court to conduct an \"appropriate inquiry\"\ninto the financial status of a defendant who seeks appointed\ncounsel,    id.   §    3006A(b),   the    applicant      bears   the    burden   of\n\npersuading the court that he is financially unable to obtain\ncounsel, see United States v.
