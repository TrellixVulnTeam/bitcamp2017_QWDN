José Antonio Fusté,      U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                    Selya, Lipez and Howard,\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Christopher Munoz    on   Application    for   a   Certificate   of\nAppealability pro se.\n\n\n\n                           May 29, 2003\n\f     Per Curiam.   After the district court had summarily dismissed\n\nhis petition to set aside his conviction and sentence under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255 (2000) — a statute that provides what we have termed\n\na surrogate for habeas corpus, see Ellis v. United States, 313 F.3d\n\n636, 641 (1st Cir. 2002) — petitioner-appellant Christopher Munoz,\n\na federal prisoner, invoked Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) and filed a\n\nmotion for relief from the dismissal order.     The district court\n\ndenied that motion as well.   The petitioner appealed and now moves\n\nthis court for a certificate of appealability (COA). See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2253.   Because his notice of appeal is timely only as to the\n\ndistrict court's disposition of the Rule 60(b) motion, we do not\n\nfrontally address the claims raised in his section 2255 petition.\n\nSee Browder v. Director, Ill. Dep't of Corrections, 434 U.S. 257,\n\n263 n.7 (1978).\n\n     We recently determined, in the context of a proceeding brought\n\nby a state prisoner under 28 U.S.C. § 2254, that a Rule 60(b)\n\nmotion that principally challenges the constitutionality of a\n\nhabeas petitioner's underlying conviction should be treated as a\n\nsecond or successive habeas petition under the Antiterrorism and\n\nEffective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat.\n\n1214 (1996).   See Rodwell v. Pepe, 324 F.3d 66, 70 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(\"When the motion's factual predicate deals primarily with the\n\nconstitutionality of the underlying . . . conviction or sentence,\n\nthen the [Rule 60(b)] motion should be treated as a second or\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fsuccessive habeas petition.\").       We conclude that the reasoning set\n\nforth in Rodwell applies with equal force in the section 2255\n\nmilieu.   After all, the AEDPA incorporates by reference in section\n\n2255   the   same   \"second   or   successive\"    screen    that   it   makes\n\napplicable to second or successive habeas petitions prosecuted on\n\nbehalf of state prisoners under section 2254.          Compare 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2255 ¶ 8 with 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(2)(A).         We hold, therefore, that\n\na motion made under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure for relief from a judgment previously entered in a\n\nsection 2255 case \"should be treated as a second or successive\n\nhabeas petition if — and only if — the factual predicate set forth\n\nin support of the motion constitutes a direct challenge to the\n\nconstitutionality of the underlying conviction.\"           See Rodwell, 324\n\nF.2d at 67.     If, however, \"the factual predicate set forth in\n\nsupport of the motion attacks only the manner in which the earlier\n\nhabeas judgment has been procured [,] the motion may be adjudicated\n\nunder the jurisprudence of Rule 60(b).\"          Id.\n\n       That holding effectively ends this matter.        In his Rule 60(b)\n\nmotion, the petitioner challenges the constitutionality of his\n\nunderlying conviction and argues the merits of his foundational\n\nsentencing claims (particularly his claim under Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000)).       Thus, his case falls squarely with\n\nin the prescriptive reach of the Rodwell holding. The petitioner's\n\nRule 60(b) motion must, therefore, be treated as a second or\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fsuccessive habeas petition.\n\n       So viewed, the motion is hopeless.              The AEDPA requires a\n\nfederal prisoner, before prosecuting a second or successive habeas\n\npetition in the district court, to obtain from \"the appropriate\n\ncourt of appeals . . . an order authorizing the district court to\n\nconsider     the    application.\"      28    U.S.C.    §     2244(b)(3)(A)      (as\n\nincorporated in 28 U.S.C. § 2255); see Raineri v. United States,\n\n233 F.3d 96, 99 (1st Cir. 2000).       Inasmuch as the petitioner did not\n\nseek, let alone obtain, the required authorization from this court,\n\nthe district court lacked jurisdiction over his Rule 60(b) motion.\n\nConsequently, both his appeal and his attempt to obtain a COA                must\n\nfail.\n\n       We add, moreover, that were we to construe the petitioner's\n\nfilings in this court as a request for such an authorization, we\n\nwould perforce deny it.          His papers fail to make the requisite\n\nshowing either of newly discovered evidence or of a new rule of\n\nconstitutional law made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases\n\non collateral review.          See 28 U.S.C. § 2255 ¶ 8; cf.             Tyler v.\n\nCain, 533 U.S. 656, 662 (2001) (holding that the identically worded\n\nrequirement contained in 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(2)(A) is \"satisfied\n\nonly    if   [the   Supreme]   Court   has   held     that   the   new   rule    is\n\nretroactively applicable to cases on collateral review\").\n\n       We need go no further.       For the reasons stated, the district\n\ncourt appropriately rejected the petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fFor our part, we reject the misplaced effort to secure a COA and\n\nterminate the phantom appeal.\n\n     So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
