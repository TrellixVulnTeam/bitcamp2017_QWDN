Petitioner Martin E. Canaveral\n\nToban (“Canaveral”), a native and citizen of Colombia, seeks review\n\nof the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) denial of his motion to\n\nreopen its summary affirmance of the Immigration Judge's (IJ)\n\ndeportation order.   Recognizing that some of Canaveral’s claims\n\nwere not properly raised in a motion to reopen, the BIA treated his\n\nmotion as both a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider.   With\n\none minor exception, Canaveral focuses his appeal exclusively on\n\nthe portion of the BIA’s opinion denying his motion to reopen.   He\n\nargues that the BIA should have reopened the proceedings to permit\n\nthe IJ to consider his request for deferral of deportation under\n\nthe United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT)1 and his claim\n\nof ineffective assistance of counsel.    Finding that the BIA acted\n\nwell within its discretion, we affirm.\n\n                                I.\n\n          On December 19, 1992, petitioner Canaveral, a citizen of\n\nColombia, legally entered the United States as a nonimmigrant in\n\ntransit to a ship that was docked in New Orleans, Louisiana.      He\n\nnever boarded the ship.   Instead, he moved to Boston and, after\n\nobtaining a fraudulent social security card, started working for a\n\nshoe manufacturing company.\n\n\n     1\n       The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85,\nwas implemented in the United States by the Foreign Affairs Reform\nand Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-277, § 2242, 112\nStat. 2681-761 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 (2000)).\n\n                               -2-\n\f             In 1995, Canaveral gave a non-lawyer known as \"Tony\"2\n\nnine hundred dollars to prepare an asylum application, which was\n\npresented to the INS in 1997.            “Tony” disappeared soon after he\n\ncompleted Canaveral's application, forcing Canaveral to retract\n\nthat application and to inform the asylum officer that “Tony”\n\nfilled     out   the   forms   without    his    participation      or   consent.\n\nCanaveral prepared a second application and presented that to the\n\nINS.\n\n             The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)3 issued\n\na notice to appear on January 21, 1998, charging Canaveral as an\n\nalien lawfully admitted to the United States who failed to maintain\n\nthe nonimmigrant status that he had when admitted in violation of\n\nsection 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act\n\n(INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i).             Conceding removability at his\n\nhearing     on   January   28,    1999,    Canaveral       sought   asylum     and\n\nwithholding      of    removal   pursuant       to   INA   sections      208   and\n\n243(b)(3)(A).\n\n             Canaveral testified before the IJ that he was afraid to\n\nreturn to Colombia because he feared persecution by governmental\n\n\n       2\n      The record suggests that Tony portrayed himself as a lawyer\neven though he apparently was not one.\n       3\n      In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred into the Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized as the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(\"BICE\"). For simplicity we refer to the agency throughout this\nopinion as the INS.\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fand non-governmental entities for his earlier political activities,\n\nsome of which were conducted in secret with the non-violent wing of\n\nthe Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) when he was a\n\ncollege student.   Although his connection to FARC was secret, he\n\norganized rallies and student strikes, and went door-to-door in\n\nfavor of education, economic, and health policy reform in his home\n\ncity of Itagüi between 1984 and 1992.       He said that he received\n\nanonymous death threats in response to his organizing efforts, and\n\nthat a partner in one of his early protests disappeared and was\n\nlater found murdered. Canaveral testified that the police beat him\n\nin 1984 and in 1988 or 1989 after they stopped him and found FARC\n\nliterature in his possession.      In the latter case, the police beat\n\nhim so severely that they knocked out his two front teeth and\n\nfractured his ribs and femur.       The police held him for two days,\n\naccused him of being responsible for a bomb that had detonated in\n\nthe middle of town, threatened him with death, and then released\n\nhim outside of the city limits.\n\n           In the late 1980s, having decided that FARC had become\n\ntoo violent, Canaveral took a job overseeing construction projects\n\nfor the city of Itagüi to allow him to stop his organizing work\n\nwith FARC.    He authored a report in October 1992 documenting\n\nmassive   corruption   in   the   construction   bidding   process   and,\n\nrebuffing attempts to bribe him by contractors and other city\n\nofficials, he presented that report to the members of the city\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fcouncil.    One month later, a man on a motorcycle opened fire on him\n\nand a friend, wounding both. Canaveral went into hiding after that\n\nattempt on his life, staying with a local priest and then with his\n\nmother.    With the priest's help, Canaveral was able to procure a\n\ntransit and a crewman's visa from the American Consulate in Bogota\n\non December 11, 1992 even though he did not work on a ship.          The\n\nlocal     police   department   provided   him   with   protection   for\n\napproximately seventy-eight hours while he obtained the visa.\n\n            After considering Canaveral's testimony and a significant\n\namount of country-specific evidence about Colombia, the IJ denied\n\nCanaveral's asylum claim.        Explaining that Canaveral did not\n\nprovide any specifics regarding his alleged involvement with FARC\n\nand that his testimony demonstrated that Canaveral was able to\n\ncarry out his daily activities with little or no interference from\n\nprivate or governmental entities, the IJ concluded that Canaveral\n\nfailed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution.4    The IJ noted that Canaveral never identified\n\n\n     4\n      “An asylum applicant bears the burden of establishing that he\nor she meets the statutory definition of a refugee and is therefore\neligible for asylum. 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a). Applicants may meet\nthis burden in one of two ways. First, an applicant qualifies as a\nrefugee if he or she demonstrates a well-founded fear of\npersecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership\nin a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 C.F.R. §\n208.13(b).     Alternatively, the applicant is entitled to a\npresumption of a well-founded fear of persecution if he or she\nestablishes past persecution on account of one of the five\nstatutory grounds.” Mihaylov v. Ashcroft, 379 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir.\n2004).\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fhimself as a FARC member to anyone outside the organization and\n\nthat there was no evidence suggesting that the Colombian government\n\nthought that he was associated with the organization. In fact, the\n\nlack of any documented follow-up by government officials after the\n\nalleged beating in 1988 or 1989 and the police protection that\n\nCanaveral received in 1992 suggested that the government did not\n\nconsider him a threat.   The IJ characterized the gunfire incident\n\nas a random act of violence lacking any demonstrable connection\n\nwith FARC or the government, and concluded that any threats that\n\nCanaveral may have received before his departure were designed to\n\nhide the corruption that Canaveral was attempting to uncover.\n\nMoreover, the acts of violence that allegedly occurred in 1984,\n\n1988 (or 1989) and 1992 were separated by a significant amount of\n\ntime and did not appear to be part of an organized persecution.\n\nFinally, the IJ noted that Canaveral was able to leave Colombia\n\nwithout incident and that there is no indication that individuals\n\nassociated with FARC or the government have made regular visits to\n\nCanaveral's family home seeking his whereabouts.   Accordingly, the\n\nIJ concluded that \"[t]here is no evidence that would clearly lead\n\n[the court] to conclude that the government has taken action\n\nagainst [Canaveral].\" The IJ denied his asylum application and\n\nordered him deported to Colombia.\n\n          The IJ expressed concerns about Canaveral's credibility\n\nbecause of the dishonest manner in which he obtained his visa, the\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\ffalse documents he used to obtain employment in Boston, his failure\n\nto prevent the inclusion of false information in his original\n\nasylum   application,      and    questions     about     the    honesty    of   the\n\ntranslator    that     Canaveral    provided     for    his     initial    hearing.\n\nHowever, a closer reading of the IJ's decision reveals that he\n\nfound Canaveral's asylum case deficient apart from any adverse\n\ncredibility determination.\n\n           Canaveral appealed to the BIA, restating the evidence and\n\nclaiming that he feared persecution from the government for being\n\na former FARC member and from FARC itself for disavowing his\n\nmembership.     The BIA affirmed the IJ's decision without comment on\n\nDecember 20, 2002.       Canaveral did not file a direct appeal of the\n\nBIA's decision.\n\n             Canaveral's attorney passed away after he filed the\n\nappeal to the BIA; Canaveral retained new counsel and filed a\n\nmotion captioned “Motion to Reopen (Asylum Case)” on January 15,\n\n2003.    He sought to reopen his asylum case to obtain relief under\n\nthe CAT and to address attorney incompetence (concerning the asylum\n\napplication prepared by \"Tony\"), the court's improper consideration\n\nof this disavowed application (which he characterized as “Judicial\n\nArbitrariness”), and the IJ’s allegedly erroneous conclusion that\n\nhe failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution\n\nwhich,   even    if    established,     could    have     been    ameliorated      by\n\nrelocating      to    another    part   of    Colombia.         Recognizing      that\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fCanaveral’s      claims   regarding   his   failure      to   establish   future\n\npersecution and the related relocation issue should have been\n\nraised in a motion for reconsideration, the BIA treated these\n\nclaims within the framework of such a motion.                 It considered the\n\nother claims within the framework of the motion to reopen.\n\n               The BIA rejected the motion to reconsider, affirming its\n\noriginal analysis and stating:\n\n               We are not persuaded by the respondent's\n               contentions that our prior decision was either\n               legally, or factually, erroneous.     Just as\n               this Board will not entertain a motion for\n               reconsideration for the sole purpose of\n               entertaining a late appeal, we will not grant\n               a motion for reconsideration for the sole\n               purpose of permitting a belated discussion\n               that should have been made at the time of the\n               original appeal to the Board.\n\nIt explicitly rejected Canaveral’s allegation that the potential\n\nfor relocation played a role in the IJ’s decision, stating that he\n\n“failed to demonstrate what, if any, role ‘relocation’ played in\n\nthe   Immigration     Judge’s   decision.”5    Concluding       that   Canaveral\n\nfailed    to    demonstrate   prejudice     from   the   alleged    ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel and that he failed to establish a prima facie\n\ncase under the CAT, the BIA denied his motion to reopen.               Canaveral\n\n\n      5\n      Canaveral raises the same claim regarding relocation on\nappeal. Once again, he fails to cite any evidence demonstrating\nthat the IJ rejected his asylum claim after concluding that he\ncould be relocated to a different part of Colombia.    In fact,\nrelocation only comes into play if the alien successfully\nestablishes a prima facie case for asylum, and the IJ concluded\nthat Canaveral failed to do so.    8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(ii),\n(b)(2).\n\n                                      -8-\n\ffiled a timely appeal of the BIA's denial of his motion to\n\nreconsider and motion to reopen.   However, since the issues raised\n\nby Canaveral on appeal were addressed by the Board within the\n\nframework of the motion to reopen (the only exception being the\n\n\"relocation\" issue which we have already dispatched), we limit our\n\nreview to the Board's denial of the motion to reopen.\n\n                               II.\n\n           We review the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen for\n\nabuse of discretion.6 See Betouche v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 147,\n\n149-150 (1st Cir. 2004).   \"An abuse of discretion will be found\n\nwhere the BIA misinterprets the law, or acts either arbitrarily or\n\ncapriciously.\" Wang v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nA motion to reopen allows an alien to bring newly-discovered\n\nevidence or grounds for relief to the attention of the BIA.   Such\n\na motion must state the new facts to be proven or grounds to be\n\nalleged.   The BIA may only grant a motion to reopen based on new\n\nfacts if the “evidence sought to be offered is material and was not\n\navailable and could not have been discovered or presented at the\n\nformer hearing.\"   8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).    It may only grant a\n\nmotion to reopen to consider a new ground for relief if it appears\n\nthe alien’s right to apply for such relief was not fully explained\n\n\n\n     6\n      Canaveral argues in his brief that we should adopt a\n“fiduciary” standard of review. He fails to support his argument\nwith any citation to pertinent authority and we are unaware of any\nsuch authority. We reject his argument without further discussion.\n\n                               -9-\n\fto him or her, that the alien did not have an opportunity to apply\n\nfor such relief at the earlier hearing, or that the newly-proffered\n\nground for relief is premised on changed circumstances.      Id.\n\nA.    Convention Against Torture\n\n            Canaveral claims that he is entitled to relief under the\n\nCAT based on the Colombian government's acquiescence in his likely\n\ntorture by FARC.    The BIA rejected this proposition in his motion\n\nto reopen, concluding that he failed to present a prima facie case\n\nthat he was eligible for relief under the applicable regulations.\n\nSee 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-108\n\n(1988) (relating the prima facie case requirement to the public\n\ninterest in \"bringing litigation to a close as promptly as is\n\nconsistent with the interest in giving the adversaries a fair\n\nopportunity to develop and present their respective cases\").       We\n\nagree.\n\n            To establish a valid claim for relief under the CAT, an\n\napplicant must \"establish that it is more likely than not that he\n\nor she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of\n\nremoval.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2). The term \"torture\" is defined\n\nas:\n\n            [A]ny act by which severe pain or suffering,\n            whether physical or mental, is intentionally\n            inflicted on a person for such purposes as\n            obtaining from him or her or a third person\n            information or a confession, punishing him or\n            her for an act he or she or a third person has\n            committed or is suspected of having committed,\n            or intimidating or coercing him or her or a\n\n                                   -10-\n\f             third person, or for any reason based on\n             discrimination of any kind, when such pain or\n             suffering   is  inflicted   by   or  at   the\n             instigation of or with the consent or\n             acquiescence of a public official or other\n             person acting in an official capacity.\n\n8   C.F.R.    §   1208.18(a)(1).   The   regulations    also     provide   that\n\n\"[t]orture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and\n\ndoes not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading\n\ntreatment or punishment that do not amount to torture.\"                8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.18(a)(2).\n\n             Canaveral claims that it is more likely than not that\n\neither the Colombian government will torture him or that it will\n\nacquiesce in his torture at the hands of FARC.          However, as the BIA\n\nobserved, he failed to substantiate this claim with detailed\n\nevidence that he will be tortured in the future or even that he was\n\ntortured in the past.       His briefs before the BIA and here on appeal\n\nconsist of general outlines of the legal principles applicable to\n\nthe CAT.     They do not articulate, with any degree of specificity,\n\nhow those principles apply to Canaveral.          As the government aptly\n\nobserved in its brief: “It is entirely unclear exactly who he\n\nbelieves will torture him, what mistreatment he expects to suffer,\n\nor, most importantly, what evidence supports his claim.” Given the\n\nlack   of    detail   in   Canaveral’s   motion   to   reopen,    we   have   no\n\ndifficulty affirming the BIA’s decision denying his motion to\n\nreopen to consider his CAT claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fB.   Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n           Canaveral      argues     that     \"Tony\"   provided     him   with\n\nineffective assistance of counsel by presenting a fraudulent asylum\n\napplication, depriving him of due process.             We normally apply the\n\nfactors listed in In re Matter of Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637 (BIA\n\n1988), to such ineffectiveness claims: (1) the motion must be\n\nsupported by an affidavit detailing the agreement between counsel\n\nand client, (2) the counsel must be informed of the allegations and\n\ngiven a chance to respond, and (3) the motion must indicate whether\n\na complaint regarding any violation of counsel's ethical or legal\n\nresponsibilities has been filed with the relevant disciplinary\n\nauthorities and if not, why not.            \"Tony\", of course, was not a\n\nlawyer subject to the authority of a disciplinary body that could\n\nreceive complaints about his work.             However, we do not have to\n\ndecide here the applicability of the Lozada factors to cases in\n\nwhich non-lawyers represented aliens.7 Our precedents clearly hold\n\nthat, except   in   the    extreme    case,    an   alien   must   demonstrate\n\nprejudice regardless of whether he or she meets the other Lozada\n\nfactors.   See, e.g., Bernal-Vallejo v. INS, 195 F.3d 56, 64 (1st\n\n\n\n     7\n      Non-lawyers may represent aliens in immigration proceedings\nunder certain circumstances. 8 C.F.R. § 292.1. However, \"Tony\"\nwas probably ineligible to represent Canaveral in this situation\nbecause he does not appear to have been a law student, 8 C.F.R. §\n292.1(a)(2), a reputable individual appearing without remuneration,\n8 C.F.R. § 292.1(a)(3), or an accredited representative of a non-\nprofit organization, 8 C.F.R. § 292.1(a)(4), 292.2, during the\nevents in question.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fCir. 1999).     Although we theorized in United States v. Loaisiga,\n\n104 F.3d 484, 488 (1st Cir. 1997) that \"there may be deportations\n\nwhere a denial of counsel was so flagrant, and the difficulty of\n\nproving prejudice so great, as to argue for presuming harm,\" this\n\nis not such an extreme case.       The IJ allowed Canaveral to submit a\n\nnew asylum application to replace the fraudulent one prepared with\n\nthe \"help\" of \"Tony\".       Although the IJ alluded to the fraudulent\n\napplication as one of several factors that impaired Canaveral's\n\ncredibility, he did not characterize it as decisive on the issue of\n\ncredibility.      More    importantly,       as   already   noted,    the   IJ's\n\ndetermination    was     based   on    Canaveral's     failure   to    produce\n\nsufficient evidence; this is independent of any adverse credibility\n\ndetermination. In the absence of any showing of prejudice from the\n\nalleged ineffectiveness of a sham attorney, we conclude that the\n\nBIA properly refused to reopen this case to address the claim of\n\nineffectiveness.8\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      In addressing Canaveral's ineffectiveness claim, we have also\naddressed his related claim of judicial arbitrariness because the\nIJ allegedly refused to consider any evidence other than the\nfraudulent asylum application.

Canaveral Toban (\"Canaveral\"), a native and citizen of Colombia, seeks review of the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) denial of his motion to reopen its summary affirmance of the Immigration Judge's (IJ) deportation order. Recognizing that some of Canaveral's claims were not properly raised in a motion to reopen, the BIA treated his motion as both a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider. With one minor exception, Canaveral focuses his appeal exclusively on the portion of the BIA's opinion denying his motion to reopen. He argues that the BIA should have reopened the proceedings to permit the IJ to consider his request for deferral of deportation under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Finding that the BIA acted well within its discretion, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 19, 1992, petitioner Canaveral, a citizen of Colombia, legally entered the United States as a nonimmigrant in transit to a ship that was docked in New Orleans, Louisiana. He never boarded the ship. Instead, he moved to Boston and, after obtaining a fraudulent social security card, started working for a shoe manufacturing company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, Canaveral gave a non-lawyer known as \"Tony\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> nine hundred dollars to prepare an asylum application, which was presented to the INS in 1997. \"Tony\" disappeared soon after he completed Canaveral's application, forcing Canaveral to retract that application and to inform the asylum officer that \"Tony\" filled out the forms without his participation or consent. Canaveral prepared a second application and presented that to the INS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> issued a notice to appear on January 21, 1998, charging Canaveral as an alien lawfully admitted to the United States who failed to maintain the nonimmigrant status that he had when admitted in violation of section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1)(C)(i). Conceding removability at his hearing on January 28, 1999, Canaveral sought asylum and withholding of removal pursuant to INA sections 208 and 243(b)(3)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Canaveral testified before the IJ that he was afraid to return to Colombia because he feared persecution by governmental and non-governmental entities for his earlier political activities, some of which were conducted in secret with the non-violent wing of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) when he was a college student. Although his connection to FARC was secret, he organized rallies and student strikes, and went door-to-door in favor of education, economic, and health policy reform in his home city of Itagui between 1984 and 1992. He said that he received anonymous death threats in response to his organizing efforts, and that a partner in one of his early protests disappeared and was later found murdered. Canaveral testified that the police beat him in 1984 and in 1988 or 1989 after they stopped him and found FARC literature in his possession. In the latter case, the police beat him so severely that they knocked out his two front teeth and fractured his ribs and femur. The police held him for two days, accused him of being responsible for a bomb that had detonated in the middle of town, threatened him with death, and then released him outside of the city limits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the late 1980s, having decided that FARC had become too violent, Canaveral took a job overseeing construction projects for the city of Itagui to allow him to stop his organizing work with FARC. He authored a report in October 1992 documenting massive corruption in the construction bidding process and, rebuffing attempts to bribe him by contractors and other city officials, he presented that report to the members of the city council. One month later, a man on a motorcycle opened fire on him and a friend, wounding both. Canaveral went into hiding after that attempt on his life, staying with a local priest and then with his mother. With the priest's help, Canaveral was able to procure a transit and a crewman's visa from the American Consulate in Bogota on December 11, 1992 even though he did not work on a ship. The local police department provided him with protection for approximately seventy-eight hours while he obtained the visa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considering Canaveral's testimony and a significant amount of country-specific evidence about Colombia, the IJ denied Canaveral's asylum claim. Explaining that Canaveral did not provide any specifics regarding his alleged involvement with FARC and that his testimony demonstrated that Canaveral was able to carry out his daily activities with little or no interference from private or governmental entities, the IJ concluded that Canaveral failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The IJ noted that Canaveral never identified himself as a FARC member to anyone outside the organization and that there was no evidence suggesting that the Colombian government thought that he was associated with the organization. In fact, the lack of any documented follow-up by government officials after the alleged beating in 1988 or 1989 and the police protection that Canaveral received in 1992 suggested that the government did not consider him a threat. The IJ characterized the gunfire incident as a random act of violence lacking any demonstrable connection with FARC or the government, and concluded that any threats that Canaveral may have received before his departure were designed to hide the corruption that Canaveral was attempting to uncover. Moreover, the acts of violence that allegedly occurred in 1984, 1988 (or 1989) and 1992 were separated by a significant amount of time and did not appear to be part of an organized persecution. Finally, the IJ noted that Canaveral was able to leave Colombia without incident and that there is no indication that individuals associated with FARC or the government have made regular visits to Canaveral's family home seeking his whereabouts. Accordingly, the IJ concluded that \"[t]here is no evidence that would clearly lead [the court] to conclude that the government has taken action against [Canaveral].\" The IJ denied his asylum application and ordered him deported to Colombia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ expressed concerns about Canaveral's credibility because of the dishonest manner in which he obtained his visa, the false documents he used to obtain employment in Boston, his failure to prevent the inclusion of false information in his original asylum application, and questions about the honesty of the translator that Canaveral provided for his initial hearing. However, a closer reading of the IJ's decision reveals that he found Canaveral's asylum case deficient apart from any adverse credibility determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Canaveral appealed to the BIA, restating the evidence and claiming that he feared persecution from the government for being a former FARC member and from FARC itself for disavowing his membership. The BIA affirmed the IJ's decision without comment on December 20, 2002. Canaveral did not file a direct appeal of the BIA's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Canaveral's attorney passed away after he filed the appeal to the BIA; Canaveral retained new counsel and filed a motion captioned \"Motion to Reopen (Asylum Case)\" on January 15, 2003. He sought to reopen his asylum case to obtain relief under the CAT and to address attorney incompetence (concerning the asylum application prepared by \"Tony\"), the court's improper consideration of this disavowed application (which he characterized as \"Judicial Arbitrariness\"), and the IJ's allegedly erroneous conclusion that he failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution which, even if established, could have been ameliorated by relocating to another part of Colombia. Recognizing that Canaveral's claims regarding his failure to establish future persecution and the related relocation issue should have been raised in a motion for reconsideration, the BIA treated these claims within the framework of such a motion. It considered the other claims within the framework of the motion to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA rejected the motion to reconsider, affirming its original analysis and stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not persuaded by the respondent's contentions that our prior decision was either legally, or factually, erroneous. Just as this Board will not entertain a motion for reconsideration for the sole purpose of entertaining a late appeal, we will not grant a motion for reconsideration for the sole purpose of permitting a belated discussion that should have been made at the time of the original appeal to the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It explicitly rejected Canaveral's allegation that the potential for relocation played a role in the IJ's decision, stating that he \"failed to demonstrate what, if any, role `relocation' played in the Immigration Judge's decision.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Concluding that Canaveral failed to demonstrate prejudice from the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel and that he failed to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case under the CAT, the BIA denied his motion to reopen. Canaveral filed a timely appeal of the BIA's denial of his motion to reconsider and motion to reopen. However, since the issues raised by Canaveral on appeal were addressed by the Board within the framework of the motion to reopen (the only exception being the \"relocation\" issue which we have already dispatched), we limit our review to the Board's denial of the motion to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>II.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Betouche v. Ashcroft,</i> 357 F.3d 147, 149-150 (1st Cir.2004). \"An abuse of discretion will be found where the BIA misinterprets the law, or acts either arbitrarily or capriciously.\" <i>Wang v. Ashcroft,</i> 367 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.2004). A motion to reopen allows an alien to bring newly-discovered evidence or grounds for relief to the attention of the BIA. Such a motion must state the new facts to be proven or grounds to be alleged. The BIA may only grant a motion to reopen based on new facts if the \"evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(c)(1). It may only grant a motion to reopen to consider a new ground for relief if it appears the alien's right to apply for such relief was not fully explained to him or her, that the alien did not have an opportunity to apply for such relief at the earlier hearing, or that the newly-proffered ground for relief is premised on changed circumstances. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Convention Against Torture</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Canaveral claims that he is entitled to relief under the CAT based on the Colombian government's acquiescence in his likely torture by FARC. The BIA rejected this proposition in his motion to reopen, concluding that he failed to present a <i>prima facie</i> case that he was eligible for relief under the applicable regulations. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.16(c); <i>INS v. Abudu,</i> 485 U.S. 94, 104-108, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (relating the <i>prima facie</i> case requirement to the public interest in \"bringing litigation to a close as promptly as is consistent with the interest in giving the adversaries a fair opportunity to develop and present their respective cases\"). We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish a valid claim for relief under the CAT, an applicant must \"establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.16(c)(2). The term \"torture\" is defined as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ny act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.18(a)(1). The regulations also provide that \"[t]orture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.18(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Canaveral claims that it is more likely than not that either the Colombian government will torture him or that it will acquiesce in his torture at the hands of FARC. However, as the BIA observed, he failed to substantiate this claim with detailed evidence that he will be tortured in the future or even that he was tortured in the past. His briefs before the BIA and here on appeal consist of general outlines of the legal principles applicable to the CAT. They do not articulate, with any degree of specificity, how those principles apply to Canaveral. As the government aptly observed in its brief: \"It is entirely unclear exactly who he believes will torture him, what mistreatment he expects to suffer, or, most importantly, what evidence supports his claim.\" Given the lack of detail in Canaveral's motion to reopen, we have no difficulty affirming the BIA's decision denying his motion to reopen to consider his CAT claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Canaveral argues that \"Tony\" provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel by presenting a fraudulent asylum application, depriving him of due process. We normally apply the factors listed in <i>In re Matter of Lozada,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 1988 WL 235454 (BIA 1988), to such ineffectiveness claims: (1) the motion must be supported by an affidavit detailing the agreement between counsel and client, (2) the counsel must be informed of the allegations and given a chance to respond, and (3) the motion must indicate whether a complaint regarding any violation of counsel's ethical or legal responsibilities has been filed with the relevant disciplinary authorities and if not, why not. \"Tony\", of course, was not a lawyer subject to the authority of a disciplinary body that could receive complaints about his work. However, we do not have to decide here the applicability of the <i>Lozada</i> factors to cases in which non-lawyers represented aliens.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Our precedents clearly hold that, except in the extreme case, an alien must demonstrate prejudice regardless of whether he or she meets the other <i>Lozada</i> factors. <i>See, e.g., Bernal-Vallejo v. INS,</i> 195 F.3d 56, 64 (1st Cir.1999). Although we theorized in <i>United States v. Loaisiga,</i> 104 F.3d 484, 488 (1st Cir.1997) that \"there may be deportations where a denial of counsel was so flagrant, and the difficulty of proving prejudice so great, as to argue for presuming harm,\" this is not such an extreme case. The IJ allowed Canaveral to submit a new asylum application to replace the fraudulent one prepared with the \"help\" of \"Tony\". Although the IJ alluded to the fraudulent application as one of several factors that impaired Canaveral's credibility, he did not characterize it as decisive on the issue of credibility. More importantly, as already noted, the IJ's determination was based on Canaveral's failure to produce sufficient evidence; this is independent of any adverse credibility determination. In the absence of any showing of prejudice from the alleged ineffectiveness of a sham attorney, we conclude that the BIA properly refused to reopen this case to address the claim of ineffectiveness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85, was implemented in the United States by the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub.L.

Conceding removability at his hearing on January 28, 1999, Canaveral sought asylum and withholding of removal pursuant to INA sections 208 and 243(b)(3)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Canaveral testified before the IJ that he was afraid to return to Colombia because he feared persecution by governmental and non-governmental entities for his earlier political activities, some of which were conducted in secret with the non-violent wing of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) when he was a college student. Although his connection to FARC was secret, he organized rallies and student strikes, and went door-to-door in favor of education, economic, and health policy reform in his home city of Itagui between 1984 and 1992. He said that he received anonymous death threats in response to his organizing efforts, and that a partner in one of his early protests disappeared and was later found murdered. Canaveral testified that the police beat him in 1984 and in 1988 or 1989 after they stopped him and found FARC literature in his possession. In the latter case, the police beat him so severely that they knocked out his two front teeth and fractured his ribs and femur. The police held him for two days, accused him of being responsible for a bomb that had detonated in the middle of town, threatened him with death, and then released him outside of the city limits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the late 1980s, having decided that FARC had become too violent, Canaveral took a job overseeing construction projects for the city of Itagui to allow him to stop his organizing work with FARC. He authored a report in October 1992 documenting massive corruption in the construction bidding process and, rebuffing attempts to bribe him by contractors and other city officials, he presented that report to the members of the city council. One month later, a man on a motorcycle opened fire on him and a friend, wounding both. Canaveral went into hiding after that attempt on his life, staying with a local priest and then with his mother. With the priest's help, Canaveral was able to procure a transit and a crewman's visa from the American Consulate in Bogota on December 11, 1992 even though he did not work on a ship. The local police department provided him with protection for approximately seventy-eight hours while he obtained the visa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considering Canaveral's testimony and a significant amount of country-specific evidence about Colombia, the IJ denied Canaveral's asylum claim. Explaining that Canaveral did not provide any specifics regarding his alleged involvement with FARC and that his testimony demonstrated that Canaveral was able to carry out his daily activities with little or no interference from private or governmental entities, the IJ concluded that Canaveral failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The IJ noted that Canaveral never identified himself as a FARC member to anyone outside the organization and that there was no evidence suggesting that the Colombian government thought that he was associated with the organization. In fact, the lack of any documented follow-up by government officials after the alleged beating in 1988 or 1989 and the police protection that Canaveral received in 1992 suggested that the government did not consider him a threat. The IJ characterized the gunfire incident as a random act of violence lacking any demonstrable connection with FARC or the government, and concluded that any threats that Canaveral may have received before his departure were designed to hide the corruption that Canaveral was attempting to uncover. Moreover, the acts of violence that allegedly occurred in 1984, 1988 (or 1989) and 1992 were separated by a significant amount of time and did not appear to be part of an organized persecution. Finally, the IJ noted that Canaveral was able to leave Colombia without incident and that there is no indication that individuals associated with FARC or the government have made regular visits to Canaveral's family home seeking his whereabouts. Accordingly, the IJ concluded that \"[t]here is no evidence that would clearly lead [the court] to conclude that the government has taken action against [Canaveral].\" The IJ denied his asylum application and ordered him deported to Colombia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ expressed concerns about Canaveral's credibility because of the dishonest manner in which he obtained his visa, the false documents he used to obtain employment in Boston, his failure to prevent the inclusion of false information in his original asylum application, and questions about the honesty of the translator that Canaveral provided for his initial hearing. However, a closer reading of the IJ's decision reveals that he found Canaveral's asylum case deficient apart from any adverse credibility determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Canaveral appealed to the BIA, restating the evidence and claiming that he feared persecution from the government for being a former FARC member and from FARC itself for disavowing his membership. The BIA affirmed the IJ's decision without comment on December 20, 2002. Canaveral did not file a direct appeal of the BIA's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Canaveral's attorney passed away after he filed the appeal to the BIA; Canaveral retained new counsel and filed a motion captioned \"Motion to Reopen (Asylum Case)\" on January 15, 2003. He sought to reopen his asylum case to obtain relief under the CAT and to address attorney incompetence (concerning the asylum application prepared by \"Tony\"), the court's improper consideration of this disavowed application (which he characterized as \"Judicial Arbitrariness\"), and the IJ's allegedly erroneous conclusion that he failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution which, even if established, could have been ameliorated by relocating to another part of Colombia. Recognizing that Canaveral's claims regarding his failure to establish future persecution and the related relocation issue should have been raised in a motion for reconsideration, the BIA treated these claims within the framework of such a motion. It considered the other claims within the framework of the motion to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA rejected the motion to reconsider, affirming its original analysis and stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not persuaded by the respondent's contentions that our prior decision was either legally, or factually, erroneous.

Canaveral filed a timely appeal of the BIA's denial of his motion to reconsider and motion to reopen. However, since the issues raised by Canaveral on appeal were addressed by the Board within the framework of the motion to reopen (the only exception being the \"relocation\" issue which we have already dispatched), we limit our review to the Board's denial of the motion to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>II.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Betouche v.

A motion to reopen allows an alien to bring newly-discovered evidence or grounds for relief to the attention of the BIA. Such a motion must state the new facts to be proven or grounds to be alleged.

It may only grant a motion to reopen to consider a new ground for relief if it appears the alien's right to apply for such relief was not fully explained to him or her, that the alien did not have an opportunity to apply for such relief at the earlier hearing, or that the newly-proffered ground for relief is premised on changed circumstances. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

The BIA rejected this proposition in his motion to reopen, concluding that he failed to present a <i>prima facie</i> case that he was eligible for relief under the applicable regulations. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.16(c); <i>INS v.

However, as the BIA observed, he failed to substantiate this claim with detailed evidence that he will be tortured in the future or even that he was tortured in the past. His briefs before the BIA and here on appeal consist of general outlines of the legal principles applicable to the CAT. They do not articulate, with any degree of specificity, how those principles apply to Canaveral. As the government aptly observed in its brief: \"It is entirely unclear exactly who he believes will torture him, what mistreatment he expects to suffer, or, most importantly, what evidence supports his claim.\" Given the lack of detail in Canaveral's motion to reopen, we have no difficulty affirming the BIA's decision denying his motion to reopen to consider his CAT claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Canaveral argues that \"Tony\" provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel by presenting a fraudulent asylum application, depriving him of due process. We normally apply the factors listed in <i>In re Matter of Lozada,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">235454</span></span> (BIA 1988), to such ineffectiveness claims: (1) the motion must be supported by an affidavit detailing the agreement between counsel and client, (2) the counsel must be informed of the allegations and given a chance to respond, and (3) the motion must indicate whether a complaint regarding any violation of counsel's ethical or legal responsibilities has been filed with the relevant disciplinary authorities and if not, why not. \"Tony\", of course, was not a lawyer subject to the authority of a disciplinary body that could receive complaints about his work. However, we do not have to decide here the applicability of the <i>Lozada</i> factors to cases in which non-lawyers represented aliens.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Our precedents clearly hold that, except in the extreme case, an alien must demonstrate prejudice regardless of whether he or she meets the other <i>Lozada</i> factors. <i>See, e.g., Bernal-Vallejo v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198702\"><a href=\"/opinion/198702/vallejo-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 64 (1st Cir.1999). Although we theorized in <i>United States v. Loaisiga,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197160\"><a href=\"/opinion/197160/united-states-v-loaisiga/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></a></span>, 488 (1st Cir.1997) that \"there may be deportations where a denial of counsel was so flagrant, and the difficulty of proving prejudice so great, as to argue for presuming harm,\" this is not such an extreme case. The IJ allowed Canaveral to submit a new asylum application to replace the fraudulent one prepared with the \"help\" of \"Tony\". Although the IJ alluded to the fraudulent application as one of several factors that impaired Canaveral's credibility, he did not characterize it as decisive on the issue of credibility. More importantly, as already noted, the IJ's determination was based on Canaveral's failure to produce sufficient evidence; this is independent of any adverse credibility determination. In the absence of any showing of prejudice from the alleged ineffectiveness of a sham attorney, we conclude that the BIA properly refused to reopen this case to address the claim of ineffectiveness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85, was implemented in the United States by the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub.L.
