Muktar Singh Sandhu is an Indian national\n\nwho entered the United States without authorization, possibly\n\narriving from Mexico in 1993 (when he apparently filed a petition\n\nfor asylum that was later abandoned).   He was served with a notice\n\nto appear on August 14, 2003, which charged him as being removable\n\nas an alien who arrived in the United States without authorization.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (2000).     He appeared, with counsel,\n\nbefore the immigration court on October 20, 2003.\n\n          At that time Sandhu said he needed more time to prepare\n\nfor the removal hearing and was granted a year in which to do so;\n\nthe Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") orally informed Sandhu and his counsel\n\nthat the removal hearing was rescheduled for October 13, 2004.   In\n\nthe courtroom he was then handed a new notice of hearing directed\n\nto another alien with a different hearing date.     The immigration\n\ncourt discovered this error several days later and mailed to\n\nSandhu's counsel an accurate notice of hearing with the correct\n\ndate, as permitted under the governing notice statutes.    8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229(a)(1), (2).\n\n          On October 13, 2004, neither Sandhu nor his counsel\n\nappeared, and the IJ found that Sandhu had been provided with the\n\nrequired notice of the hearing and was removable, and he entered an\n\nin absentia removal order as permitted by 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(5)(A).\n\nSandhu apparently arrived at the immigration court the following\n\nday and discovered that he had been removed in absentia; he filed\n\n\n                               -2-\n\fon the same day an affidavit with a motion by counsel requesting\n\nreopening of the proceedings (as is permitted where exceptional\n\ncircumstances exist, id. § 1229a(5)(C)(i)).\n\n              Curiously, neither the affidavit nor the motion says that\n\nhis counsel did not receive the corrected notice or that Sandhu was\n\nnot informed that the corrected notice had been received.                In\n\nSandhu's affidavit requesting reopening there is a vague reference\n\nto confusion about the date and to the fact that the in-hand notice\n\nwas addressed to a different person, but Sandhu failed to make a\n\nstraightforward claim that he never received notice of the correct\n\nhearing date (which was provided both orally and in writing).\n\n              The IJ wrote a decision setting out these events and\n\nnoting the statutory requirements for entering and rescinding an in\n\nabsentia removal order.      8 U.S.C. § 1229a(5)(A), (C).        The IJ said\n\nthat the correct notice of hearing had been mailed to Sandhu's\n\ncounsel of record, and that Sandhu had failed to present evidence\n\nthat he did not receive this notice.           Sandhu filed a motion to\n\nreconsider (again failing to claim that he was unaware of the\n\ncorrected notice) which was also denied by the IJ.\n\n              The BIA affirmed the IJ's rulings without opinion, and\n\nSandhu now appeals to this court. The governing statute limits our\n\nreview but permits Sandhu to raise the central issue: whether the\n\nIJ   abused    his   discretion   in    concluding   that   no   exceptional\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fcircumstances justified the failure to appear.     See 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1229a(b)(5)(D).\n\n          On this record the case is not even close.   Sandhu never\n\noffered an affidavit or other evidence to the IJ that he was\n\nunaware of the corrected notice, nor has he demonstrated why, in\n\nview of the correct oral notice and correct follow-up written\n\nnotice, he had any basis for confusion.   Belatedly, in this court,\n\nhe has now asserted in a motion--not an affidavit--that he does\n\nclaim not to have known of the corrected notice; the proffer,\n\noffered without adequate detail, comes way too late and is still\n\ninadequate to establish confusion, let alone justified confusion.1\n\n          This court has in several cases been protective of aliens\n\nin situations in which there has been genuine confusion as to the\n\nhearing date or an excusable absence, at least where there also\n\nappeared to be some plausible basis to contest removability.   See\n\nKaweesa v. Gonzales, No. 04-2548, 2006 WL 1575400, at *5-*7 (1st\n\nCir. June 9, 2006); Herbert v. Ashcroft, 325 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).   But in this instance, Sandhu has never explained what he\n\nwould say to contest removability, and there was no abuse of\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      For Sandhu to say that he did not receive the corrected\nnotice in no way establishes that he was confused about the date.\nIt was given to him orally, the incorrect notice was addressed to\na different person, and while the corrected notice was sent only to\nhis lawyer (which binds him under the governing rules), Sandhu says\nnothing about whether his lawyer reconfirmed the date with him\nwithout informing him of the notice.\n\n                               -4-\n\fdiscretion   in   rejecting   his   inadequately   supported   claim   of\n\nconfusion.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f",
