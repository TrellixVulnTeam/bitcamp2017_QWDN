Defendant-appellant Wheeled\n\nCoach Industries, Inc. (\"Wheeled Coach\") appeals from the entry of\n\na preliminary injunction by the district court under the Puerto\n\nRico Dealers Act, Law 75 of June 24, 1964, 10 P.R. Laws Ann. § 278-\n\n278d (\"Law 75\"), ordering Wheeled Coach to reinstate an exclusive\n\ndistribution agreement with plaintiff-appellee Re-Ace, Inc. (\"Re-\n\nAce\").    After careful review, we affirm.\n\n                           I.    Background\n\n           We begin by summarizing briefly the relevant facts as\n\nfound by the district court. Wheeled Coach, a Florida corporation,\n\nmanufactures ambulances for sale throughout the United States.          In\n\n1979, Wheeled Coach sold its first ambulance in Puerto Rico, and\n\nfrom that first sale onward, Re-Ace, a Puerto Rico corporation,\n\ninitiated and managed Wheeled Coach's relations with its clients in\n\nPuerto Rico. Until the events that brought about this suit, Re-Ace\n\nhad been involved in every sale of a Wheeled Coach ambulance in\n\nPuerto Rico.\n\n            The parties' relationship, which proceeded uninterrupted\n\nfor over two decades, was organized thus: Re-Ace promotes and\n\ncloses the sales contracts for Wheeled Coach ambulances with both\n\nprivate   and   governmental   clients.    Re-Ace   does   not   keep   an\n\ninventory of Wheeled Coach ambulances, in order to avoid excise\n\ntaxes and because all ambulances are custom-made by Wheeled Coach\n\nto meet the specifications of each client.      Re-Ace determines the\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\ffinal sales price of the ambulances and thus determines its own\n\nprofit -- the difference between the final sales price and the list\n\nprice for the ambulance set by Wheeled Coach.          Wheeled Coach also\n\npays a standard commission to Re-Ace of four hundred dollars per\n\nambulance sold.     Re-Ace is responsible to the clients for the\n\ndelivery of the ambulances and may be subject to penalties for\n\ndelay.   Re-Ace is responsible for collecting the clients' payment\n\nfor the ambulances and must pay Wheeled Coach if an order is\n\nsubsequently cancelled.       Re-Ace is responsible for servicing and\n\nhonoring   the   warranty   claims    of   Wheeled   Coach's    Puerto   Rico\n\nclients. Over the years, Re-Ace has developed a substantial market\n\nfor Wheeled Coach ambulances in Puerto Rico and is identified as\n\nWheeled Coach's distributor and representative on the island.\n\n           This arrangement proceeded on the basis of an oral\n\ncontract   until   1989,    when   the   parties   executed    an   Exclusive\n\nDistributor's Agreement granting Re-Ace exclusive distribution\n\nrights for Wheeled Coach ambulances in Puerto Rico.1           The practical\n\naspects of the parties' relationship continued as before. In 2002,\n\nWheeled Coach sent Re-Ace a new proposed agreement that would have,\n\namong other things, made the relationship non-exclusive.               Re-Ace\n\n\n\n1\n   This was a standard agreement sent to Re-Ace by Wheeled Coach.\nWheeled Coach argues that, because it has not been able to locate\nin its records the signed copy of the agreement Re-Ace claims to\nhave sent back to Wheeled Coach, the agreement was never executed\nby Re-Ace.    The district court found that Re-Ace signed the\nagreement and that it has been in effect since 1989.\n\n                                     -3-\n\frejected this agreement and business went on as usual. In February\n\n2003, Wheeled Coach terminated its relationship with Re-Ace and\n\nentered into an agreement granting exclusive distribution rights to\n\nBill de León Specialty Vehicles (\"Bill de León\").\n\n          On March 14, 2003, Re-Ace commenced this action seeking\n\ninjunctive relief and recovery of damages for an alleged illegal\n\ntermination of an exclusive distribution agreement in violation of\n\nLaw 75.   Re-Ace requested a preliminary injunction ordering the\n\nreestablishment   of   the   prior   relationship   between   Re-Ace   and\n\nWheeled Coach and enjoining Bill de León from representing Wheeled\n\nCoach in Puerto Rico for the duration of the suit.         A preliminary\n\ninjunction hearing was held on May 13, 2003.        On June 25, 2003, the\n\ndistrict court issued a preliminary injunction ordering Wheeled\n\nCoach to reinstate the exclusive distribution agreement with Re-Ace\n\nand enjoining Wheeled Coach from entering into or maintaining any\n\ndistribution agreement with third parties.\n\n          On July 8, 2003, Wheeled Coach moved for reconsideration,\n\nrequesting that the district court vacate the injunction.        Wheeled\n\nCoach argued that the district court erred in identifying Re-Ace as\n\na distributor under Law 75 and in disregarding the procedural\n\nsafeguards of Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by\n\nissuing a preliminary injunction without ordering Re-Ace to post\n\nany form of security and without notice to an adverse party, Bill\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fde León.2   On July 31, 2003, the district court denied the motion\n\nfor reconsideration, but imposed a bond of $50,000 on Re-Ace.\n\nWheeled Coach appeals.\n\n                              II.   Analysis\n\n            Law 75 was enacted \"to remedy the abusive practices of\n\nsuppliers who arbitrarily eliminated distributors after they had\n\ninvested in the business and had successfully established a market\n\nin Puerto Rico for the supplier's product or service.\"              Triangle\n\nTrading Co., Inc. v. Robroy Indus., Inc., 200 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.\n\n1999)(quoting González v. Brown Group, Inc., 628 F. Supp. 436, 438-\n\n39 (D.P.R. 1985)(internal quotations omitted)).          To this end, Act\n\n75 regulates the termination of a supplier's relationship with a\n\ndealer, providing that, regardless of any unilateral right to\n\nterminate present in a contract, \"no principal or grantor may\n\ndirectly    or   indirectly   perform     any   act   detrimental    to   the\n\nestablished relationship . . . , except for just cause.\"             10 P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. § 278a.3\n\n            Provisional remedies under Law 75 are provided by the\n\nstatute:\n\n            In any litigation in which there is . . .\n            involved the termination of a dealer's\n            contract . . . , the Court may grant, during\n\n\n2\n   Re-Ace has subsequently dismissed its claims against Bill de\nLeón.\n3\n   The terms \"dealer,\" \"distributor,\" and \"distributorship\" are\nused interchangeably in the caselaw concerning Law 75.\n\n                                    -5-\n\f           the time the litigation is pending resolution,\n           any provisional remedy . . . ordering any of\n           the parties, or both, to continue, in all its\n           terms, the relation established by the\n           dealer's contract, and/or to abstain from\n           performing any act or any omission in\n           prejudice thereof. In any case in which the\n           provisional    remedy   herein   provided   is\n           requested, the Court shall consider the\n           interests of all parties concerned and the\n           purposes of the public policy contained in\n           this chapter.\n\n10 P.R. Laws Ann. § 278b-1 (\"Article 3A\").4        The question before us\n\nis whether there has been a sufficient showing that Re-Ace is a\n\n\"dealer\" who may take advantage of Law 75's provisional remedies.\n\n           This court has jurisdiction to hear interlocutory appeals\n\nof preliminary injunction orders under 28 U.S.C. § 1291(a)(1).             In\n\nreviewing a preliminary injunction, \"we scrutinize abstract legal\n\nmatters de novo, findings of fact for clear error, and judgment\n\ncalls with considerable deference to the trier.\" New Comm Wireless\n\nServs.,   Inc.    v.   SprintCom,   Inc.,   287   F.3d   1,   9   (1st   Cir.\n\n2002)(citing Langlois v. Abington Hous. Auth., 207 F.2d 43, 47 (1st\n\nCir. 2000)).     Despite Wheeled Coach's contentions to the contrary,\n\nour review of the evidence before the district court at the\n\n\n4\n   This does not mean, however, that the procedural safeguards\nprovided by the Rules of Civil Procedure are inapplicable to the\nprovisional remedies provided by Law 75. Aybar v. F. & B. Mfg.\nCo., Inc., 498 F. Supp. 1184, 1192 (D.P.R. 1980).       On appeal,\nWheeled Coach argues that the district court abused its discretion\nby imposing on Re-Ace an inadequate injunction bond of $50,000.\nWheeled Coach has subsequently filed a motion in the district court\nrequesting an increase to the bond, and in an order dated\nNovember 26, 2003, the district court increased the bond to\n$100,000.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fpreliminary injunction hearing fails to indicate clear error in the\n\ndistrict court's findings of fact.5           Thus, on the basis of the\n\nfacts found by the district court, we review de novo the question\n\nof whether the relationship between Re-Ace and Wheeled Coach\n\nwarrants Re-Ace's protection for preliminary injunction purposes as\n\na dealer under Law 75.\n\n          Law 75 defines a dealer as a \"person actually interested\n\nin a dealer's contract because of his having effectively in his\n\ncharge in Puerto Rico the distribution, agency, concession or\n\nrepresentation of a given merchandise or service.\"             10 P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. § 278(a).   A dealer's contract is defined as a \"relationship\n\nestablished between a dealer and a principal or grantor whereby and\n\nirrespectively   of   the   manner   in    which   the   parties   may   call,\n\ncharacterize or execute such relationship, the former actually and\n\neffectively takes charge of the distribution of a merchandise, or\n\nof the rendering of a service, by concession or franchise, on the\n\nmarket of Puerto Rico.\"     10 P.R. Laws Ann. § 278(b).\n\n          Both federal and Puerto Rico courts have recognized that\n\nthis broad definition of a dealer \"encompasses a wide range of\n\nactors within the distribution process and threatens to extend Act\n\n\n\n5\n   Although failing to describe some details of the commercial\ntransactions between Re-Ace and Wheeled Coach, particularly the\nrole of the Ford dealerships associated with Re-Ace, the district\ncourt's findings provide a summary of the relevant aspects of the\nrelationship sufficient for the purposes of determining whether Re-\nAce is a dealer under Law 75.\n\n                                     -7-\n\f75's protective sweep well beyond the end that the statute sought\n\nto achieve.\"   Triangle Trading, 200 F.3d at 4.       In Triangle\n\nTrading, we outlined the factors to be considered in determining\n\nwhether an actor is a dealer protected by Law 75, relying on the\n\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico's decision in Roberco, Inc. v. Oxford\n\nIndus., Inc., 22 P.R. Offic. Trans. 111 (1988):\n\n          The Roberco court reviewed the legislative\n          history of Act 75 and the existing case law,\n          of both Puerto Rico and the federal courts, to\n          develop an inclusive list of factors to be\n          weighed equally in consideration of whether a\n          party has the requisite autonomy to be a\n          dealer under the Act.         Observing that\n          something beyond mere contact with the product\n          as it moves down the chain from manufacturer\n          to supplier is necessary, the court restricted\n          the definition of a dealer to an independent\n          entrepreneur who has established a continuing\n          relationship, either fixed or indeterminate,\n          with another principal for the distribution of\n          a product or service . . . geared to create,\n          develop, and coordinate a market and to obtain\n          new clients. From this definition the court\n          derived the following characteristics of a\n          dealership: promotion of the product, keeping\n          an inventory, fixing prices, delivery and\n          billing responsibilities, authority to extend\n          credit, advertising campaigns, assumption of\n          risk, purchasing the product, maintaining\n          facilities,   and   offering   product-related\n          services to clients.\n\nTriangle Trading, 200 F.3d at 4-5 (citing Roberco, 22 P.R. Offic.\n\nTrans. at 115, 120-32)(internal quotations omitted).       Triangle\n\nTrading makes clear that Re-Ace must do more than provide evidence\n\nthat it developed a market for Wheeled Coach and made a financial\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\finvestment, because \"those facts alone are not dispositive as they\n\napply to any sales agent or middleman.\"     Id. at 5.\n\n          Wheeled Coach urges this court to conclude that Re-Ace is\n\nnot a dealer for the purposes of Law 75 because Re-Ace, inter alia,\n\ndoes not purchase the ambulances for resale, does not maintain an\n\ninventory of Wheeled Coach ambulances in Puerto Rico, and does not\n\nassume a risk of financial loss beyond any fees or fines imposed in\n\nthe case of late or failed delivery of ambulances. Re-Ace contends\n\nthat its failure to purchase or maintain an inventory of Wheeled\n\nCoach ambulances and the resulting diminution of some of the\n\ntypical   financial   risks   of   distributorship   are   due   to   the\n\ncustomized nature of the item being sold, since each ambulance must\n\nbe manufactured to meet the precise specifications of the client.\n\n           The district court agreed, concluding that \"since 1979,\n\n[Re-Ace] has performed the duties traditionally performed by a\n\ndistributor, tempered to the particular product to be distributed,\n\nin this case, custom made ambulances.\"       Re-Ace, Inc. v. Wheeled\n\nCoach Indus., Inc., 270 F. Supp. 2d 223, 231 (D.P.R. 2003).           In\n\nreaching this conclusion, the district court noted that the Supreme\n\nCourt of Puerto Rico has made it clear that when considering the\n\nfactors in Roberco \"not all had to be satisfied in order to\n\ndetermine that a plaintiff is an Act 75 distributor.        Instead, a\n\ntrial court must consider said factors in light of the evidence\n\npresented.\"   Id. at 232.   The court distinguished the case of Cobos\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fLiccia v. DeJean Packing Co., Inc., 124 D.P.R. 896 (1989), where\n\nthe plaintiff was denied dealer status under Law 75 because it\n\nfailed to fulfill even one of the Roberco criteria.           Id. at 231-33.\n\n           Here, Re-Ace fulfills several of the Roberco criteria,\n\nincluding active promotion and closing of contracts, exerting\n\ncontrol   over   prices,6    taking    responsibility   for   delivery    (as\n\nevidenced by their exposure to fines for late delivery), and\n\nassuming the risks and responsibility of its actions (e.g., if a\n\nclient subsequently decides not to purchase an ambulance after it\n\nis ordered, Re-Ace must compensate Wheeled Coach).\n\n           Wheeled Coach argues that Re-Ace cannot be a dealer under\n\nLaw 75 because it never obtains title to the ambulances, directing\n\nthe court's attention to Franceschini v. Riley Co., 591 F. Supp.\n\n414, 419 (D.P.R. 1984)(\"[A]n Act 75 distributor is not a mere agent\n\nof the principal but acts on its own with full ownership of the\n\ngoods sold.\").     In Franceschini, however, the court decided that\n\nthe plaintiff was not a Law 75 dealer because it was \"a mere\n\nforwarder of orders who did not have the authority to close or\n\nconclude the sales contracts it promoted.\"         Id. at 420.      Despite\n\nthe   court's    reference    to   ownership,   then,   the    decision   in\n\nFranceschini relies on its conclusion that \"the ultimate matter to\n\n\n6\n  Wheeled Coach argues that because its price list determines the\n\"price\" of the ambulances, Re-Ace does not \"exert control over\nprices.\" However, Re-Ace determines the final sales price of the\nambulances and in doing so also determines its own remuneration in\na manner consistent with the role of a dealer under Law 75.\n\n                                      -10-\n\fbe   determined   is   whether   all   activities    performed,   be   they\n\nwarehousing, delivery, advertising, add up to the development of a\n\nmarket through promotion and closing of sales contracts.\"          Id. at\n\n418.   So, while \"purchasing the product\" is one of the Roberco\n\nfactors to be considered, it is not dispositive.        Roberco, 22 P.R.\n\nOffic. Trans. at 123 (\"No single factor is conclusive by itself and\n\nnone has more weight or importance than the others.\").\n\n           In a related argument, Wheeled Coach contends that Re-Ace\n\nis not entitled to invoke Law 75 because Re-Ace is not a Law 75\n\ndealer but rather an exclusive sales representative within the\n\nmeaning of Puerto Rico's Sales Representative Act of 1990, 10 P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. § 279 (\"Law 21\").7      Law 21 was enacted to protect sales\n\nrepresentatives and other local agents who fell short of the\n\nrequirements for \"dealership\" status under Law 75.            Innovation\n\nMktg. v. Tuffcare Inc., 31 F. Supp. 2d 218, 220 & n.1 (D.P.R.\n\n1998); Tavarez v. Champion Prods., Inc., 903 F. Supp. 268, 271\n\n(D.P.R. 1995).    It is modeled closely on Law 75 and, with limited\n\nexceptions, provides identical remedies.            See Codecom, Inc. v.\n\nAlcatel Standard, S.A., 103 F. Supp. 2d 65, 67 & n.4 (D.P.R. 2000).\n\n\n\n7\n    Re-Ace argues that Wheeled Coach forfeited any argument\nconcerning Law 21 by failing to raise the issue in the district\ncourt.   This objection misunderstands Wheeled Coach's argument.\nWheeled Coach does not claim relief on the basis of Law 21 (an\nargument that would indeed be forfeited), but rather cites Law 21\nas evidence of what Law 75 is not intended to cover.      This is\nconsistent with Wheeled Coach's contention, both in the district\ncourt and on appeal, that Law 75 does not apply to Re-Ace.\n\n                                  -11-\n\fLaw 21, however, applies only to sales representative contracts\n\nformed after December 5, 1990.   Innovation Mktg., 31 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n220; Tavarez, 903 F. Supp. at 272.      Wheeled Coach argues that its\n\nrelationship with Re-Ace is a \"sales representation contract\" under\n\nLaw 21, which means that the Puerto Rico legislature did not expect\n\nLaw 75 to apply in this context.        Re-Ace's suit under Law 75,\n\nWheeled Coach continues, is simply an attempt to evade the 1990\n\nprospective limitation on Law 21 claims.8\n\n          It is a plausible argument.        Law 21 defines a sales\n\nrepresentative as \"an independent entrepreneur who establishes a\n\nsales representation contract of an exclusive nature, with a\n\nprincipal or grantor, and who is assigned a specific territory or\n\nmarket, within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.      It includes the\n\nfigure known as 'manufacturer's representative.'\"       10 P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. § 279(a); Orba, Inc. v. MBR Indus., Inc., 49 F. Supp. 2d 67,\n\n71 (D.P.R. 1999).   A \"sales representation contract,\" in turn, is\n\ndefined as follows:\n\n          The agreement established between a sales\n          representative and a principal, through which\n          . . . the party of the first part commits\n          himself to making a reasonable effort and due\n          diligence in the creation or expansion of a\n          market which is favorable for the products\n          that   the  principal   sells,  directed   at\n          capturing clientele to offer it a product or\n          service marketed by him in Puerto Rico, and\n\n\n8\n  As previously noted, the relationship between Re-Ace and Wheeled\nCoach dates from 1979, and the two companies executed a written\ncontract in 1989.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f          the party of the second part is bound to\n          comply with the commitments that may result\n          from the sales representative's efforts and\n          coordination and to pay the previously-\n          accorded commission or remuneration.\n\n10 P.R. Laws Ann. § 279(c).             Aspects of Re-Ace's relationship with\n\nWheeled Coach do appear, at first glance, to fall within this\n\ndefinition –- for example, Wheeled Coach pays Re-Ace a commission\n\nor remuneration for each vehicle sold; Wheeled Coach is bound by\n\nsales made by Re-Ace; and Re-Ace never acquires title in the\n\nambulances.     As previously discussed, however, these facts, when\n\nviewed within the context of a custom-made product, can likewise be\n\nseen to   fit    within       \"the     duties     traditionally       performed       by   a\n\ndistributor, tempered to the particular product to be distributed,\n\nin this case, custom made ambulances.\"                   Re-Ace, Inc., 270 F.

On the\n\nbasis of the evidence before it at the preliminary injunction\n\nhearing, it was not clear error for the district court to determine\n\nthat Re-Ace     is     a    Law   75    dealer    rather       than   a   Law   21    sales\n\nrepresentative.\n\n          We conclude that the district court did not err in\n\ndetermining     that       Re-Ace      deserved    the    provisional       protections\n\nprovided to dealers by Law 75.                   Thus, the district court \"was\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\fwithin its     discretion   in   finding   that   public   policy    and   the\n\ninterests of the parties would be best served by strict temporary\n\nenforcement of the letter of the agreement.\"          DeMoss, 493 F.2d at\n\n1015.

Laws Ann. &#167; 278-278d (\"Law 75\"), ordering Wheeled Coach to reinstate an exclusive distribution agreement with plaintiff-appellee Re-Ace, Inc. (\"Re-Ace\"). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by summarizing briefly the relevant facts as found by the district court. Wheeled Coach, a Florida corporation, manufactures ambulances for sale throughout the United States. In 1979, Wheeled Coach sold its first ambulance in Puerto Rico, and from that first sale onward, Re-Ace, a Puerto Rico corporation, initiated and managed Wheeled Coach's relations with its clients in Puerto Rico. Until the events that brought about this suit, Re-Ace had been involved in every sale of a Wheeled Coach ambulance in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties' relationship, which proceeded uninterrupted for over two decades, was organized thus: Re-Ace promotes and closes the sales contracts for Wheeled Coach ambulances with both private and governmental clients. Re-Ace does not keep an inventory of Wheeled Coach ambulances, in order to avoid excise taxes and because all ambulances are custom-made by Wheeled Coach to meet the specifications of each client. Re-Ace determines the final sales price of the ambulances and thus determines its own profit &#8212; the difference between the final sales price and the list price for the ambulance set by Wheeled Coach. Wheeled Coach also pays a standard commission to Re-Ace of four hundred dollars per ambulance sold. Re-Ace is responsible to the clients for the delivery of the ambulances and may be subject to penalties for delay. Re-Ace is responsible for collecting the clients' payment for the ambulances and must pay Wheeled Coach if an order is subsequently cancelled. Re-Ace is responsible for servicing and honoring the warranty claims of Wheeled Coach's Puerto Rico clients. Over the years, Re-Ace has developed a substantial market for Wheeled Coach ambulances in Puerto Rico and is identified as Wheeled Coach's distributor and representative on the island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This arrangement proceeded on the basis of an oral contract until 1989, when the parties executed an Exclusive Distributor's Agreement granting Re-Ace exclusive distribution rights for Wheeled Coach ambulances in Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The practical aspects of the parties' relationship continued as before. In 2002, Wheeled Coach sent Re-Ace a new proposed agreement that would have, among other things, made the relationship non-exclusive. Re-Ace rejected this agreement and business went on as usual. In February 2003, Wheeled Coach terminated its relationship with Re-Ace and entered into an agreement granting exclusive distribution rights to Bill de Le&#243;n Specialty Vehicles (\"Bill de Le&#243;n\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 14, 2003, Re-Ace commenced this action seeking injunctive relief and recovery of damages for an alleged illegal termination of an exclusive distribution agreement in violation of Law 75. Re-Ace requested a preliminary injunction ordering the reestablishment of the prior relationship between Re-Ace and Wheeled Coach and enjoining Bill de Le&#243;n from representing Wheeled Coach in Puerto Rico for the duration of the suit. A preliminary injunction hearing was held on May 13, 2003. On June 25, 2003, the district court issued a preliminary injunction ordering Wheeled Coach to reinstate the exclusive distribution agreement with Re-Ace and enjoining Wheeled Coach from entering into or maintaining any distribution agreement with third parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 8, 2003, Wheeled Coach moved for reconsideration, requesting that the district court vacate the injunction. Wheeled Coach argued that the district court erred in identifying Re-Ace as a distributor under Law 75 and in disregarding the procedural safeguards of Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by issuing a preliminary injunction without ordering Re-Ace to post any form of security and without notice to an adverse party, Bill de Le&#243;n.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On July 31, 2003, the district court denied the motion for reconsideration, but imposed a bond of $50,000 on Re-Ace. Wheeled Coach appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law 75 was enacted \"to remedy the abusive practices of suppliers who arbitrarily eliminated distributors after they had invested in the business and had successfully established a market in Puerto Rico for the supplier's product or service.\" <i>Triangle Trading Co., Inc. v. Robroy Indus., Inc.,</i> 200 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1999)(quoting <i>Gonz&#225;lez v. Brown Group, Inc.,</i> 628 F.Supp. 436, 438-39 (D.P.R.1985)(internal quotations omitted)). To this end, Act 75 regulates the termination of a supplier's relationship with a dealer, providing that, regardless of any unilateral right to terminate present in a contract, \"no principal or grantor may directly or indirectly perform any act detrimental to the established relationship ..., except for just cause.\" 10 P.R.

Laws Ann. &#167; 278b-1 (\"Article 3A\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The question before us is whether there has been a sufficient showing that Re-Ace is a \"dealer\" who may take advantage of Law 75's provisional remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has jurisdiction to hear interlocutory appeals of preliminary injunction orders under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291(a)(1). In reviewing a preliminary injunction, \"we scrutinize abstract legal matters de novo, findings of fact for clear error, and judgment calls with considerable deference to the trier.\" <i>New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v. SprintCom, Inc.,</i> 287 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2002)(citing <i>Langlois v. Abington Hous. Auth.,</i> 207 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir.2000)). Despite Wheeled Coach's contentions to the contrary, our review of the evidence before the district court at the preliminary injunction hearing fails to indicate clear error in the district court's findings of fact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Thus, on the basis of the facts found by the district court, we review de novo the question of whether the relationship between Re-Ace and Wheeled Coach warrants Re-Ace's protection for preliminary injunction purposes as a dealer under Law 75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law 75 defines a dealer as a \"person actually interested in a dealer's contract because of his having effectively in his charge in Puerto Rico the distribution, agency, concession or representation of a given merchandise or service.\" 10 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 278(a). A dealer's contract is defined as a \"relationship established between a dealer and a principal or grantor whereby and irrespectively of the manner in which the parties may call, characterize or execute such relationship, the former actually and effectively takes charge of the distribution of a merchandise, or of the rendering of a service, by concession or franchise, on the market of Puerto Rico.\" 10 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 278(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both federal and Puerto Rico courts have recognized that this broad definition of a dealer \"encompasses a wide range of actors within the distribution process and threatens to extend Act 75's protective sweep well beyond the end that the statute sought to achieve.\" <i>Triangle Trading,</i> 200 F.3d at 4. In <i>Triangle Trading,</i> we outlined the factors to be considered in determining whether an actor is a dealer protected by Law 75, relying on the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's decision in <i>Roberco, Inc. v. Oxford Indus., Inc.,</i> 22 P.R. Offic. Trans. 111, 1988 WL 580769 (1988):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Roberco</i> court reviewed the legislative history of Act 75 and the existing case law, of both Puerto Rico and the federal courts, to develop an inclusive list of factors to be weighed equally in consideration of whether a party has the requisite autonomy to be a dealer under the Act. Observing that something beyond mere contact with the product as it moves down the chain from manufacturer to supplier is necessary, the court restricted the definition of a dealer to an independent entrepreneur who has established a continuing relationship, either fixed or indeterminate, with another principal for the distribution of a product or service ... geared to create, develop, and coordinate a market and to obtain new clients. From this definition the court derived the following characteristics of a dealership: promotion of the product, keeping an inventory, fixing prices, delivery and billing responsibilities, authority to extend credit, advertising campaigns, assumption of risk, purchasing the product, maintaining facilities, and offering product-related services to clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Triangle Trading,</i> 200 F.3d at 4-5 (citing <i>Roberco,</i> 22 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 115, 120-32) (internal quotations omitted). <i>Triangle Trading</i> makes clear that Re-Ace must do more than provide evidence that it developed a market for Wheeled Coach and made a financial investment, because \"those facts alone are not dispositive as they apply to any sales agent or middleman.\" <i>Id.</i> at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wheeled Coach urges this court to conclude that Re-Ace is not a dealer for the purposes of Law 75 because Re-Ace, <i>inter alia,</i> does not purchase the ambulances for resale, does not maintain an inventory of Wheeled Coach ambulances in Puerto Rico, and does not assume a risk of financial loss beyond any fees or fines imposed in the case of late or failed delivery of ambulances. Re-Ace contends that its failure to purchase or maintain an inventory of Wheeled Coach ambulances and the resulting diminution of some of the typical financial risks of distributorship are due to the customized nature of the item being sold, since each ambulance must be manufactured to meet the precise specifications of the client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court agreed, concluding that \"since 1979, [Re-Ace] has performed the duties traditionally performed by a distributor, tempered to the particular product to be distributed, in this case, custom made ambulances.\" <i>Re-Ace, Inc. v. Wheeled Coach Indus., Inc.,</i> 270 F.Supp.2d 223, 231 (D.P.R.2003). In reaching this conclusion, the district court noted that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has made it clear that when considering the factors in <i>Roberco</i> \"not all had to be satisfied in order to determine that a plaintiff is an Act 75 distributor. Instead, a trial court must consider said factors in light of the evidence presented.\" <i>Id.</i> at 232. The court distinguished the case of <i>Cobos Liccia v. DeJean Packing Co., Inc.,</i> 124 D.P.R. 896 (1989), where the plaintiff was denied dealer status under Law 75 because it failed to fulfill even one of the <i>Roberco</i> criteria. <i>Id.</i> at 231-33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Re-Ace fulfills several of the <i>Roberco</i> criteria, including active promotion and closing of contracts, exerting control over prices,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> taking responsibility for delivery (as evidenced by their exposure to fines for late delivery), and assuming the risks and responsibility of its actions (e.g., if a client subsequently decides not to purchase an ambulance after it is ordered, Re-Ace must compensate Wheeled Coach).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wheeled Coach argues that Re-Ace cannot be a dealer under Law 75 because it never obtains title to the ambulances, directing the court's attention to <i>Franceschini v. Riley Co.,</i> 591 F.Supp. 414, 419 (D.P.R.1984)(\"[A]n Act 75 distributor is not a mere agent of the principal but acts on its own with full ownership of the goods sold.\"). In <i>Franceschini,</i> however, the court decided that the plaintiff was not a Law 75 dealer because it was \"a mere forwarder of orders who did not have the authority to close or conclude the sales contracts it promoted.\" <i>Id.</i> at 420. Despite the court's reference to ownership, then, the decision in <i>Franceschini</i> relies on its conclusion that \"the ultimate matter to be determined is whether all activities performed, be they warehousing, delivery, advertising, add up to the development of a market through promotion and closing of sales contracts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 418. So, while \"purchasing the product\" is one of the <i>Roberco</i> factors to be considered, it is not dispositive. <i>Roberco,</i> 22 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 123 (\"No single factor is conclusive by itself and none has more weight or importance than the others.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a related argument, Wheeled Coach contends that Re-Ace is not entitled to invoke Law 75 because Re-Ace is not a Law 75 dealer but rather an exclusive sales representative within the meaning of Puerto Rico's Sales Representative Act of 1990, 10 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 279 (\"Law 21\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Law 21 was enacted to protect sales representatives and other local agents who fell short of the requirements for \"dealership\" status under Law 75. <i>Innovation Mktg. v. Tuffcare Inc.,</i> 31 F.Supp.2d 218, 220 &amp; n. 1 (D.P.R.1998); <i>Tavarez v. Champion Prods., Inc.,</i> 903 F.Supp. 268, 271 (D.P.R.1995). It is modeled closely on Law 75 and, with limited exceptions, provides identical remedies. <i>See Codecom, Inc. v. Alcatel Standard, S.A.,</i> 103 F.Supp.2d 65, 67 &amp; n. 4 (D.P.R.2000). Law 21, however, applies only to sales representative contracts formed after December 5, 1990. <i>Innovation Mktg.,</i> 31 F.Supp.2d at 220; <i>Tavarez,</i> 903 F.Supp. at 272. Wheeled Coach argues that its relationship with Re-Ace is a \"sales representation contract\" under Law 21, which means that the Puerto Rico legislature did not expect Law 75 to apply in this context. Re-Ace's suit under Law 75, Wheeled Coach continues, is simply an attempt to evade the 1990 prospective limitation on Law 21 claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a plausible argument. Law 21 defines a sales representative as \"an independent entrepreneur who establishes a sales representation contract of an exclusive nature, with a principal or grantor, and who is assigned a specific territory or market, within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. It includes the figure known as `manufacturer's representative.'\" 10 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 279(a); <i>Orba, Inc. v. MBR Indus., Inc.,</i> 49 F.Supp.2d 67, 71 (D.P.R.1999). A \"sales representation contract,\" in turn, is defined as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement established between a sales representative and a principal, through which ... the party of the first part commits himself to making a reasonable effort and due diligence in the creation or expansion of a market which is favorable for the products that the principal sells, directed at capturing clientele to offer it a product or service marketed by him in Puerto Rico, and the party of the second part is bound to comply with the commitments that may result from the sales representative's efforts and coordination and to pay the previously-accorded commission or remuneration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 279(c). Aspects of Re-Ace's relationship with Wheeled Coach do appear, at first glance, to fall within this definition &#8212; for example, Wheeled Coach pays Re-Ace a commission or remuneration for each vehicle sold; Wheeled Coach is bound by sales made by Re-Ace; and Re-Ace never acquires title in the ambulances. As previously discussed, however, these facts, when viewed within the context of a custom-made product, can likewise be seen to fit within \"the duties traditionally performed by a distributor, tempered to the particular product to be distributed, in this case, custom made ambulances.\" <i>Re-Ace, Inc.,</i> 270 F.Supp.2d at 231. The distinction between a Law 75 dealer and a Law 21 sales representative is \"essentially a fact-specific one.\" <i>Innovation Mktg.,</i> 31 F.Supp.2d at 221; <i>Triangle Trading Co. v. Robroy Indus., Inc.,</i> 952 F.Supp. 75, 78 (D.P.R.1997). On the basis of the evidence before it at the preliminary injunction hearing, it was not clear error for the district court to determine that Re-Ace is a Law 75 dealer rather than a Law 21 sales representative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the district court did not err in determining that Re-Ace deserved the provisional protections provided to dealers by Law 75. Thus, the district court \"was within its discretion in finding that public policy and the interests of the parties would be best served by strict temporary enforcement of the letter of the agreement.\" <i>DeMoss,</i> 493 F.2d at 1015. Of course, Wheeled Coach has the opportunity to present further evidence and to argue anew the question of Re-Ace's status as a dealer at trial. <i>See Luis Rosario, Inc. v.

Laws Ann. &#167; 278-278d (\"Law 75\"), ordering Wheeled Coach to reinstate an exclusive distribution agreement with plaintiff-appellee Re-Ace, Inc. (\"Re-Ace\"). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by summarizing briefly the relevant facts as found by the district court. Wheeled Coach, a Florida corporation, manufactures ambulances for sale throughout the United States. In 1979, Wheeled Coach sold its first ambulance in Puerto Rico, and from that first sale onward, Re-Ace, a Puerto Rico corporation, initiated and managed Wheeled Coach's relations with its clients in Puerto Rico. Until the events that brought about this suit, Re-Ace had been involved in every sale of a Wheeled Coach ambulance in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties' relationship, which proceeded uninterrupted for over two decades, was organized thus: Re-Ace promotes and closes the sales contracts for Wheeled Coach ambulances with both private and governmental clients. Re-Ace does not keep an inventory of Wheeled Coach ambulances, in order to avoid excise taxes and because all ambulances are custom-made by Wheeled Coach to meet the specifications of each client. Re-Ace determines the final sales price of the ambulances and thus determines its own profit &#8212; the difference between the final sales price and the list price for the ambulance set by Wheeled Coach. Wheeled Coach also pays a standard commission to Re-Ace of four hundred dollars per ambulance sold. Re-Ace is responsible to the clients for the delivery of the ambulances and may be subject to penalties for delay. Re-Ace is responsible for collecting the clients' payment for the ambulances and must pay Wheeled Coach if an order is subsequently cancelled. Re-Ace is responsible for servicing and honoring the warranty claims of Wheeled Coach's Puerto Rico clients. Over the years, Re-Ace has developed a substantial market for Wheeled Coach ambulances in Puerto Rico and is identified as Wheeled Coach's distributor and representative on the island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This arrangement proceeded on the basis of an oral contract until 1989, when the parties executed an Exclusive Distributor's Agreement granting Re-Ace exclusive distribution rights for Wheeled Coach ambulances in Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The practical aspects of the parties' relationship continued as before. In 2002, Wheeled Coach sent Re-Ace a new proposed agreement that would have, among other things, made the relationship non-exclusive. Re-Ace rejected this agreement and business went on as usual. In February 2003, Wheeled Coach terminated its relationship with Re-Ace and entered into an agreement granting exclusive distribution rights to Bill de Le&#243;n Specialty Vehicles (\"Bill de Le&#243;n\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 14, 2003, Re-Ace commenced this action seeking injunctive relief and recovery of damages for an alleged illegal termination of an exclusive distribution agreement in violation of Law 75. Re-Ace requested a preliminary injunction ordering the reestablishment of the prior relationship between Re-Ace and Wheeled Coach and enjoining Bill de Le&#243;n from representing Wheeled Coach in Puerto Rico for the duration of the suit. A preliminary injunction hearing was held on May 13, 2003. On June 25, 2003, the district court issued a preliminary injunction ordering Wheeled Coach to reinstate the exclusive distribution agreement with Re-Ace and enjoining Wheeled Coach from entering into or maintaining any distribution agreement with third parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 8, 2003, Wheeled Coach moved for reconsideration, requesting that the district court vacate the injunction. Wheeled Coach argued that the district court erred in identifying Re-Ace as a distributor under Law 75 and in disregarding the procedural safeguards of Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by issuing a preliminary injunction without ordering Re-Ace to post any form of security and without notice to an adverse party, Bill de Le&#243;n.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On July 31, 2003, the district court denied the motion for reconsideration, but imposed a bond of $50,000 on Re-Ace.

A dealer's contract is defined as a \"relationship established between a dealer and a principal or grantor whereby and irrespectively of the manner in which the parties may call, characterize or execute such relationship, the former actually and effectively takes charge of the distribution of a merchandise, or of the rendering of a service, by concession or franchise, on the market of Puerto Rico.\" 10 P.R.

In <i>Triangle Trading,</i> we outlined the factors to be considered in determining whether an actor is a dealer protected by Law 75, relying on the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's decision in <i>Roberco, Inc. v.

From this definition the court derived the following characteristics of a dealership: promotion of the product, keeping an inventory, fixing prices, delivery and billing responsibilities, authority to extend credit, advertising campaigns, assumption of risk, purchasing the product, maintaining facilities, and offering product-related services to clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Triangle Trading,</i> 200 F.3d at 4-5 (citing <i>Roberco,</i> 22 P.R. Offic.

Re-Ace contends that its failure to purchase or maintain an inventory of Wheeled Coach ambulances and the resulting diminution of some of the typical financial risks of distributorship are due to the customized nature of the item being sold, since each ambulance must be manufactured to meet the precise specifications of the client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court agreed, concluding that \"since 1979, [Re-Ace] has performed the duties traditionally performed by a distributor, tempered to the particular product to be distributed, in this case, custom made ambulances.\" <i>Re-Ace, Inc. v.

In reaching this conclusion, the district court noted that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has made it clear that when considering the factors in <i>Roberco</i> \"not all had to be satisfied in order to determine that a plaintiff is an Act 75 distributor. Instead, a trial court must consider said factors in light of the evidence presented.\" <i>Id.</i> at 232. The court distinguished the case of <i>Cobos Liccia v. DeJean Packing Co., Inc.,</i> 124 D.P.R. 896 (1989), where the plaintiff was denied dealer status under Law 75 because it failed to fulfill even one of the <i>Roberco</i> criteria. <i>Id.</i> at 231-33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Re-Ace fulfills several of the <i>Roberco</i> criteria, including active promotion and closing of contracts, exerting control over prices,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> taking responsibility for delivery (as evidenced by their exposure to fines for late delivery), and assuming the risks and responsibility of its actions (e.g., if a client subsequently decides not to purchase an ambulance after it is ordered, Re-Ace must compensate Wheeled Coach).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wheeled Coach argues that Re-Ace cannot be a dealer under Law 75 because it never obtains title to the ambulances, directing the court's attention to <i>Franceschini v.

In <i>Franceschini,</i> however, the court decided that the plaintiff was not a Law 75 dealer because it was \"a mere forwarder of orders who did not have the authority to close or conclude the sales contracts it promoted.\" <i>Id.</i> at 420. Despite the court's reference to ownership, then, the decision in <i>Franceschini</i> relies on its conclusion that \"the ultimate matter to be determined is whether all activities performed, be they warehousing, delivery, advertising, add up to the development of a market through promotion and closing of sales contracts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 418. So, while \"purchasing the product\" is one of the <i>Roberco</i> factors to be considered, it is not dispositive. <i>Roberco,</i> 22 P.R. Offic.

Laws Ann. &#167; 279 (\"Law 21\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Law 21 was enacted to protect sales representatives and other local agents who fell short of the requirements for \"dealership\" status under Law 75. <i>Innovation Mktg. v.

Wheeled Coach argues that its relationship with Re-Ace is a \"sales representation contract\" under Law 21, which means that the Puerto Rico legislature did not expect Law 75 to apply in this context. Re-Ace's suit under Law 75, Wheeled Coach continues, is simply an attempt to evade the 1990 prospective limitation on Law 21 claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a plausible argument. Law 21 defines a sales representative as \"an independent entrepreneur who establishes a sales representation contract of an exclusive nature, with a principal or grantor, and who is assigned a specific territory or market, within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. It includes the figure known as `manufacturer's representative.'\" 10 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 279(a); <i>Orba, Inc. v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 71 (D.P.R.1999). A \"sales representation contract,\" in turn, is defined as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement established between a sales representative and a principal, through which ... the party of the first part commits himself to making a reasonable effort and due diligence in the creation or expansion of a market which is favorable for the products that the principal sells, directed at capturing clientele to offer it a product or service marketed by him in Puerto Rico, and the party of the second part is bound to comply with the commitments that may result from the sales representative's efforts and coordination and to pay the previously-accorded commission or remuneration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 279(c). Aspects of Re-Ace's relationship with Wheeled Coach do appear, at first glance, to fall within this definition &#8212; for example, Wheeled Coach pays Re-Ace a commission or remuneration for each vehicle sold; Wheeled Coach is bound by sales made by Re-Ace; and Re-Ace never acquires title in the ambulances. As previously discussed, however, these facts, when viewed within the context of a custom-made product, can likewise be seen to fit within \"the duties traditionally performed by a distributor, tempered to the particular product to be distributed, in this case, custom made ambulances.\" <i>Re-Ace, Inc.,</i> 270 F.Supp.2d at 231. The distinction between a Law 75 dealer and a Law 21 sales representative is \"essentially a fact-specific one.\" <i>Innovation Mktg.,</i> 31 F.Supp.2d at 221; <i>Triangle Trading Co. v.

On appeal, Wheeled Coach argues that the district court abused its discretion by imposing on Re-Ace an inadequate injunction bond of $50,000. Wheeled Coach has subsequently filed a motion in the district court requesting an increase to the bond, and in an order dated November 26, 2003, the district court increased the bond to $100,000.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Although failing to describe some details of the commercial transactions between Re-Ace and Wheeled Coach, particularly the role of the Ford dealerships associated with Re-Ace, the district court's findings provide a summary of the relevant aspects of the relationship sufficient for the purposes of determining whether Re-Ace is a dealer under Law 75</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Wheeled Coach argues that because its price list determines the \"price\" of the ambulances, Re-Ace does not \"exert control over prices.\" However, Re-Ace determines the final sales price of the ambulances and in doing so also determines its own remuneration in a manner consistent with the role of a dealer under Law 75</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Re-Ace argues that Wheeled Coach forfeited any argument concerning Law 21 by failing to raise the issue in the district court. This objection misunderstands Wheeled Coach's argument. Wheeled Coach does not claim relief on the basis of Law 21 (an argument that would indeed be forfeited), but rather cites Law 21 as evidence of what Law 75 is not intended to cover. This is consistent with Wheeled Coach's contention, both in the district court and on appeal, that Law 75 does not apply to Re-Ace</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> As previously noted, the relationship between Re-Ace and Wheeled Coach dates from 1979, and the two companies executed a written contract in 1989</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
