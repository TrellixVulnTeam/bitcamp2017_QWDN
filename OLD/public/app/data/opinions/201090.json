Plaintiffs brought suit in United States\n\nDistrict Court against the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts\n\n(the \"SJC\") and others, alleging that the remedy adopted in the\n\nsame-sex marriage decision, Goodridge v. Department of Public\n\nHealth, 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003), violated their rights under\n\nthe Guarantee Clause of the federal Constitution.       The SJC, in a\n\ndivided opinion, held in Goodridge that \"barring an individual from\n\nthe protection, benefits, and obligations of civil marriage solely\n\nbecause that person would marry a person of the same sex violates\n\nthe Massachusetts Constitution.\"   798 N.E.2d at 969.    As a remedy,\n\nthe court ordered that the state of Massachusetts recognize the\n\nmarriage of same-sex couples within six months of the opinion's\n\nissuance.    Id. at 968-70.    The SJC later held that it was an\n\ninsufficient remedy under the Massachusetts Constitution merely to\n\nafford same-sex partners the same benefits as married couples\n\nwithout also recognizing their marriage.      See Opinions of the\n\nJustices to the Senate, 802 N.E.2d 565, 569-72 (Mass. 2004).\n\n            The plaintiffs, a Massachusetts citizen named Robert\n\nLargess and eleven members of the Massachusetts legislature acting\n\nas individuals, sought to enjoin the May 17, 2004 implementation of\n\nGoodridge and the issuance or recording of marriage licenses to\n\nsame-sex couples.     Julie Goodridge and her new spouse Hillary\n\nGoodridge, the named plaintiffs in the Goodridge case, along with\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fseveral others, intervened in the federal action on the side of the\n\ndefendants.\n\n          The plaintiffs' federal suit asserted that the remedy1\n\nthat the SJC adopted in Goodridge redefined marriage in violation\n\nof   separation-of-powers       principles    in    the     Massachusetts\n\nConstitution.    Under the state constitution, according to the\n\nplaintiffs, it is the prerogative of the state legislature, not the\n\ncourts, to    define   the   term   \"marriage.\"    The    plaintiffs   also\n\nasserted that the Massachusetts Constitution itself defines the\n\nterm \"marriage\" according to its historical meaning as a union\n\nbetween a man and a woman, and thus that Goodridge effected an\n\nimpermissible amendment of the state constitution that further\n\nviolated separation-of-powers principles. From the initial premise\n\nthat the state constitution was violated, the plaintiffs next\n\nasserted that the remedy in Goodridge violated their rights under\n\nthe federal Guarantee Clause of the U.S. Constitution by depriving\n\nthem of a republican form of government.\n\n          In support of their first argument that the SJC usurped\n\nthe legislature's authority, the plaintiffs relied heavily on one\n\nclause of the Massachusetts Constitution:\n\n\n     1\n       Plaintiffs assert that they are not challenging any holding\nby the SJC that same-sex couples are entitled to marital benefits.\nRather, they say, the challenge is to the SJC's \"usurping\" the\nlegislature's prerogative to define the term \"marriage\" and to its\nredefinition of that term in a way that is inconsistent with the\nunderstanding   held   by  the   framers   of  the   Massachusetts\nConstitution.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f       All causes of marriage, divorce, and alimony, and all\n       appeals from the judges of probate shall be heard and\n       determined by the governor and council, until the\n       legislature shall, by law, make other provision.\n\nMass. Const. pt. 2, ch. III, art. V.          The SJC had earlier rejected\n\nthat   very    argument    as   \"based   on   the    erroneous    premise   that\n\n[Goodridge] constituted a 'cause[] of marriage, divorce, [or]\n\nalimony' within the meaning of the Massachusetts Constitution.\"\n\nGoodridge v. Dep't of Public Health, No. SJC-08860 (Mass. May 7,\n\n2004) (order denying motion to intervene).\n\n              The plaintiffs, arguing state law illegality, also relied\n\non the SJC's holding in Opinion of the Justices, 85 N.E.2d 761\n\n(1949),   that     the    legislature    would      impermissibly   amend    the\n\nMassachusetts Constitution were it to pass a bill providing that\n\n\"subways, tunnels, viaducts, elevated structures and rapid transit\n\nextensions . . . are hereby declared to be public highways or\n\nbridges within the meaning of\" the Massachusetts Constitution.                85\n\nN.E.2d at 762.      Such a bill, held the SJC, would contravene the\n\nprinciple that the state constitution's \"words are to be given\n\ntheir natural and obvious sense according to common and approved\n\nusage at the time of their adoption.\"            Id. at 763.     Similarly, the\n\nplaintiffs argued that by altering the historic meaning of the term\n\n\"marriage,\" which is contained in the Massachusetts Constitution,\n\nthe SJC in Goodridge itself amended the state constitution, a\n\nprocess that normally must be initiated by voters of Massachusetts\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fand acted upon by the legislature, see Mass. Const. amend. art.\n\nXLVIII.\n\n            The   federal      district    court     denied      the    plaintiffs'\n\nrequests    for   preliminary     and     permanent      injunctive      relief,   a\n\ndeclaratory judgment, and a temporary restraining order.2                   Largess\n\nv. Goodridge, No. 04-10921-JLT, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8461, at *18\n\n(D. Mass. May 13, 2004).         The court concluded that the SJC did,\n\nunder the Massachusetts Constitution, have the power to redefine\n\nmarriage    and   that,   in   doing    so,   the    SJC   did    not    perform   a\n\nlegislative act.     See id. at *13-*18.         The plaintiffs appealed the\n\ndenial of preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and the\n\ndenial of a declaratory judgment, and requested an injunction\n\npending appeal.\n\n            By order dated May 14, 2004, this court denied the\n\nrequested    injunction     pending     appeal      on   the   ground     that   the\n\nplaintiffs' \"showing so far made as to likelihood of success [on\n\n\n     2\n       To obtain preliminary injunctive relief, plaintiffs had the\nburden of showing (1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2)\nthat they would suffer irreparable injury if injunctive relief were\nnot issued; (3) that such injury outweighs any harm that would stem\nfrom granting injunctive relief; and (4) that the public interest\nweighs in their favor. See R.I. Dep't of Envtl. Mgmt. v. United\nStates, 304 F.3d 31, 45 (1st Cir. 2002). The standard is virtually\nidentical for permanent injunctive relief, except that \"the movant\nmust show actual success on the merits of the claim, rather than a\nmere likelihood of such success.\" K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza,\nInc., 875 F.2d 907, 914-15 (1st Cir. 1989). The decision whether\nto grant relief is based on a balancing of the different factors,\nwith likelihood of success playing a pivotal role. See Ross-Simons\nof Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.\n1996).\n\n                                        -6-\n\fthe claimed deprivation of a republican form of government] is not\n\nsufficient to justify interim relief.\"                  In doing so, we noted\n\nvarious potential barriers to plaintiffs' claims, including the\n\ndoctrine that the decisions of a state's highest court on issues of\n\nstate    law,   including    state     constitutional     law,    are   generally\n\ntreated as      authoritative     by   federal    courts.        See Johnson     v.\n\nFankell, 520 U.S. 911, 916 (1997); Schad v. Arizona, 501 U.S. 624,\n\n636 (1991); Murdock v. City of Memphis, 87 U.S. (20 Wall.) 590\n\n(1875).    We expedited the appeal, and oral argument was held on\n\nJune 7, 2004.\n\n            On May 17, 2004, after the plaintiffs had filed their\n\nappeal    but   before    oral    arguments      were    heard,     Massachusetts\n\nimplemented     Goodridge's      requirement     that    same-sex    marriage    be\n\nrecognized. Since then, Massachusetts has issued marriage licenses\n\nto same-sex couples and has recorded same-sex marriages. Thus, the\n\nplaintiffs'     desired     injunction    would    now    have    the   effect   of\n\nstopping this practice after, rather than before, it had begun.3\n\n                                         I.\n\n            The state defendants and the defendant-intervenors raise\n\n\n\n\n     3\n        For this reason, there is no merit to the argument of\ndefendant-intervenors (which was not joined by the state\ndefendants) that this appeal is moot because May 17 has come and\npassed.    Injunctive relief could now issue to stop future\nmarriages, so a live controversy is still present and the case is\nnot moot.\n\n                                        -7-\n\fa   series   of    preliminary    objections,      some   of   which   involve\n\ninteresting and difficult issues.4\n\n             First, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs lack\n\nstanding because, at most, they share an undifferentiated harm with\n\nother    voters.     Allen   v.   Wright,    468   U.S.   737,   754   (1984);\n\nSchlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 220-\n\n21 (1974).        But the circumstances of this case present a rare\n\ninstance in which the standing issue is intertwined and inseparable\n\nfrom the merits of the underlying claim.             If the plaintiffs are\n\ncorrect that the Guarantee Clause extends rights to individuals in\n\nat least some circumstances,5 then the usual standing inquiry --\n\nwhich distinguishes between concrete injuries and injuries that are\n\nmerely abstract and undifferentiated -- might well be adjusted to\n\nthe nature of the claimed injury.           Cf.    Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S.\n\n83, 105-06 (1968) (in certain circumstances, federal taxpayers have\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       One preliminary objection of the defendants is based on\nasserted Eleventh Amendment immunity. We have no need to address\nthis issue. See Parella v. Ret. Bd. of R.I. Employees' Ret. Sys.,\n173 F.3d 46, 56-57 (1st Cir. 1999) (need not reach Eleventh\nAmendment issue if other grounds for decision in favor of party\nasserting immunity are available).\n     5\n       It is of note for purposes of the standing inquiry that the\nGuarantee Clause makes the guarantee of a republican form of\ngovernment to the states; the bare language of the Clause does not\ndirectly confer any rights on individuals vis-á-vis the states.\nWhether, in the sorts of extreme cases discussed below, voters or\nother individuals could enforce the Clause is an issue we need not\ndecide.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fstanding to raise Establishment Clause claims against congressional\n\nacts).\n\n            A second preliminary objection made by the defendants is\n\nthat Guarantee Clause claims are always non-justiciable under the\n\npolitical question doctrine6 and related caselaw.                    See Luther v.\n\nBorden, 48 U.S. (7 How.) 1, 42 (1849) (finding non-justiciable a\n\nGuarantee Clause argument by an individual claiming to act under\n\nthe authority of a state charter government because Congress, not\n\nthe federal courts, should decide which of two competing Rhode\n\nIsland governments should be recognized).                  At oral argument, the\n\nstate    defendants   retreated   from       this    absolutist      position       and\n\nacknowledged that there may be extreme cases in which a Guarantee\n\nClause    claim   would   be   justiciable,         such    as    those    involving\n\n\"permanent martial law, [the] declaration of a monarchy, [or]\n\nperhaps a hostile takeover of one branch by another.\"                          Another\n\npotential    example,     defendants    acknowledged,            might    be   a   case\n\npresenting the same facts as this case but in which the state\n\nconstitution had no mechanism for amendment, so that it was simply\n\nbeyond the power of the people to alter the SJC's holding.                         These\n\nconcessions by the state defendants demonstrate that resolving the\n\n\n\n     6\n        The political question doctrine has been infrequently used\nin recent times. As this court noted in Doe v. Bush, 323 F.3d 133\n(1st Cir. 2003), in the last forty years (now forty-one) the\nSupreme Court has found a case non-justiciable on the basis of the\npolitical question doctrine only twice, and it has explicitly\nrejected the doctrine in a number of cases. Id. at 140-41.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fissue of justiciability in the Guarantee Clause context may also\n\nturn on the resolution of the merits of the underlying claim.\n\n          Another preliminary objection advanced by the defendants\n\nis that this court should defer to the SJC's resolution of the\n\nMassachusetts     constitutional    law   questions   raised   by   the\n\nplaintiffs. Because the claimed federal Guarantee Clause violation\n\nhere depends on supposed state constitutional violations that the\n\nSJC has specifically rejected, the defendants argue that the\n\nplaintiffs cannot establish a necessary premise to their federal\n\ncase.    The defendants are correct that federal courts should\n\ngenerally defer to a state's highest court on issues of state law.\n\nSee Johnson, 520 U.S. at 916; Schad, 501 U.S. at 636; Murdock, 87\n\nU.S. at 590.    But it is at least arguable that the Guarantee Clause\n\nmight provide an exception to that rule of deference in extreme\n\ncases, such as where the members of a state's highest court\n\ndeclared the state to be a monarchy and themselves its regents.\n\nThis issue ultimately need not be resolved here, because, as we\n\nexplain below, the plaintiffs have not established a federal\n\nGuarantee Clause violation on the facts here, regardless of whether\n\nthe remedy in Goodridge offends the Massachusetts Constitution.7\n\n\n     7\n       For this reason, we do not consider the district court's\ndetermination of the state, not federal, law issue of whether the\nSJC's exercise of jurisdiction and holding in Goodridge were\nconsistent with the Massachusetts Constitution. As the brief for\nthe state defendants filed by the Attorney General of Massachusetts\nnotes, a federal court \"should be wary of . . . attempt[s] to draw\nthe Court into reviewing the decision of a state's highest court on\n\n                                   -10-\n\f                                      II.\n\n            The crucial question raised by plaintiffs' case is why\n\nthe state constitutional violations they allege, assuming they\n\nexist,   amount   to    a    violation     of    the   federal     Constitution's\n\nGuarantee   Clause.         Plaintiffs'     argument      is   that    the   alleged\n\ntransgressions of the Massachusetts Constitution have deprived them\n\nof a republican form of government by intruding on the people's\n\nrights to elect representatives and structure the government.\n\nAccording   to    the   plaintiffs,        not    every    separation-of-powers\n\nviolation under a state constitution leads to this result, but this\n\none does.     Plaintiffs argue that this is because here three\n\nconditions have been met: (1) the delegation or limitation of power\n\nto one branch in the state constitution is express, (2) there is a\n\n\"clear departure\" from the historic status quo, and (3) this \"clear\n\ndeparture\" seriously impairs a representative form of government.\n\n            Defendants      argue   that    the    Supreme      Court   has    found\n\nGuarantee    Clause      claims     non-justiciable            where    they    were\n\n\"'political' in nature and where there [was] a clear absence of\n\njudicially manageable standards.\"           Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533,\n\n582 (1964) (citing Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 217-32 (1962)).                  In\n\nresponse, plaintiffs say that their own criteria provide the needed\n\n\nmatters of state constitutional law.\"        The district court's\napproach unnecessarily opened the door, as the state defendants\nnote, to a new way \"for those dissatisfied by state court decisions\nto seek federal court review,\" by simply labeling their\ndissatisfaction as a Guarantee Clause claim.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fjudicially manageable standards, but they do not purport to find\n\nthose standards in Supreme Court precedent.\n\n            Whether or not the plaintiffs can satisfy their self-\n\ntailored test, they simply have no viable Guarantee Clause claim on\n\nthese facts.      First, the text of the Guarantee Clause does not\n\nsupport    such   a   claim.   Second,   the   Supreme   Court's   caselaw\n\ninterpreting the Guarantee Clause rejects the plaintiffs' expansive\n\nreading of the provision. Third, recognizing the plaintiffs' claim\n\nwould ultimately undermine the very purposes of the Guarantee\n\nClause, as the Supreme Court has noted.\n\n            We begin with the text of the Guarantee Clause.             It\n\nprovides that:\n\n     The United States shall guarantee to every State in this\n     Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect\n     each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the\n     Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature\n     cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.\n\nU.S. Const. art. IV, § 4.        We do not purport to spell out the\n\nentire scope or meaning of the Clause's guarantee of a republican\n\nform of government.        In fact, scholars have interpreted this\n\nportion of the Guarantee Clause in numerous, often conflicting,\n\nways.     See William M. Wiecek, The Guarantee Clause of the U.S.\n\nConstitution 293-303 (1972) (outlining different interpretations of\n\nthe Guarantee Clause); see also Akhil Reed Amar, The Central\n\nMeaning of Republican Government: Popular Sovereignty, Majority\n\nRule, and the Denominator Problem, 65 U. Colo. L. Rev. 749, 749\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f(1994); Erwin Chemerinsky, Cases Under the Guarantee Clause Should\n\nbe Justiciable, 65 U. Colo. L.

And\n\nJohn   Adams    himself,         twenty    years     after   ratification    of    the\n\nConstitution,       confessed       that       he   \"never   understood\"   what    the\n\nGuarantee Clause meant and that he \"believ[ed] no man ever did or\n\never will.\"         Letter from John Adams to Mercy Warren (July 20,\n\n1807), quoted in Wiecek, supra, at 13.\n\n            Despite the conflicting views on the precise meaning of\n\nthe Guarantee Clause, the text itself provides guidance. The first\n\nportion of the Clause is only implicated when there is a threat to\n\na \"Republican Form of Government.\"                      \"Republican\" is commonly\n\ndefined as \"of, relating to, or having the characteristics of a\n\nrepublic:    having        the   form     or    based   on   the   principles     of   a\n\nrepublic.\"      Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1928\n\n(1993).   \"Republic,\" in turn, is defined as \"a government in which\n\nsupreme power resides in a body of citizens entitled to vote and is\n\nexercised by elected officers and representatives responsible to\n\nthem and governing according to law.\" Id.; see also Oxford English\n\nDictionary (2d ed. 1989) (defining \"republic\" as \"[a] state in\n\nwhich the supreme power rests in the people and their elected\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\frepresentatives or officers, as opposed to one governed by a king\n\nor similar ruler\").         The Guarantee clause does not require a\n\nparticular allocation of power within each state so long as a\n\nrepublican form of government is preserved.             Indeed, the forms of\n\neach   state   government    at    the    time    of   the   adoption   of   the\n\nConstitution varied in terms of separations of powers, see Robert\n\nJ. Pushaw, Jr., Justiciability and Separation of Powers: A Neo-\n\nFederalist Approach, 81 Cornell L. Rev. 393, 408-11 (1996), and are\n\neach presumed to have been \"Republican\" within the meaning of the\n\nGuarantee Clause, see Minor v. Happersett, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 162,\n\n175-76 (1874).    If there is any role for federal courts under the\n\nClause, it is restricted to real threats to a republican form of\n\ngovernment.     The allocation of powers, including the amendment\n\npowers, set forth in the Massachusetts Constitution, at the time of\n\nadoption and now, self-evidently do not violate the Clause.\n\n           Comparing   the    text   of     the   Guarantee    Clause   to   the\n\ndifferent text of Article II, § 1, cl. 2 of the U.S. Constitution\n\nprovides further support for limiting federal court intervention in\n\nstate separation-of-powers violations, except, perhaps, in the most\n\negregious circumstances.          The text of Article II, § 1, cl. 2\n\nprovides that \"[e]ach State shall appoint, in such Manner as the\n\nLegislature thereof may direct\" electors for President and Vice\n\nPresident.     In contrast to the Guarantee Clause, this clause\n\nexplicitly     implicates    state       separation-of-powers      issues     by\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fconferring a right or obligation upon one branch of the state\n\ngovernment. The extent to which this more explicit text authorizes\n\nfederal     courts   to     intervene       in     state       separation-of-powers\n\nviolations is nonetheless far from clear. While several members of\n\nthe Supreme Court have suggested that federal courts can indeed\n\nreview the internal allocations of power in a state government\n\nunder the text of this clause, see Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 112\n\n(Rehnquist,    C.J.,    concurring)        (joined       by   Justices    Scalia     and\n\nThomas), that argument has been rejected by other members of the\n\nCourt, see id. at 123-24 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (joined by\n\nJustices Ginsburg and Breyer) (\"[N]othing in Article II of the\n\nFederal     Constitution     frees    the        state    legislature       from    the\n\nconstraints     in   the    State    Constitution             that    created    it.\").\n\nAccordingly, it is not clear whether the text of Article II, § 1,\n\ncl. 2 provides a basis for federal courts to review potential state\n\nseparation-of-powers violations.            In the absence of extreme cases,\n\nit is hard to understand the much less explicit text of the\n\nGuarantee     Clause,      which    does    not      clearly         reference     state\n\nseparation-of-powers issues, generally to authorize such review.\n\n            The Supreme Court cases addressing the Guarantee Clause\n\nconfirm what the plain text of the Clause suggests: most disputes\n\nconcerning the relationship among a state government's constituent\n\nbranches do not offend the Constitution's guarantee of a republican\n\nform of government.          The Supreme Court first said as much in\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fForsyth v. City of Hammond, 166 U.S. 506 (1897).            Responding to a\n\nclaim that powers belonging to a state legislature were given to\n\nthe state courts in violation of the Guarantee Clause, the Supreme\n\nCourt noted that \"[t]he preservation of legislative control in such\n\nmatters is not one of the essential elements of a republican form\n\nof government\" that is guaranteed to the states.            Id. at 519.   The\n\nCourt later generalized this point, observing in response to a\n\nGuarantee Clause claim that \"[h]ow power shall be distributed by a\n\nstate among its governmental organs is commonly, if not always, a\n\nquestion for the state itself.\"            Highland Farms Dairy, Inc. v.\n\nAgnew, 300 U.S. 608, 612 (1937); see also Pac. States Tel. & Tel.\n\nCo. v. Oregon, 223 U.S. 118, 150-57 (1912) (Guarantee Clause\n\ndefense asserted by corporation against state's action to enforce\n\npayment of taxes is non-justiciable).\n\n           Plaintiffs argue that the Supreme Court has not closed\n\nthe door to Guarantee Clause claims.        They point out that the Court\n\nassumed arguendo that the Clause was applicable in New York v.\n\nUnited States, 505 U.S. 144, 185 (1992), and that it used some\n\nexpansive language to describe the Clause in Printz v. United\n\nStates,   521   U.S.   898,   919   (1997).8     But   as   the   plaintiffs\n\n\n     8\n       In Printz, the Court noted that the Guarantee Clause\n\"presupposes the continued existence of the states and . . . those\nmeans and instrumentalities which are the creation of their\nsovereign and reserved rights,\" and thus that, through the\nGuarantee Clause and several other clauses, the states \"retained a\nresiduary and inviolable sovereignty\" when the federal government\nwas established. 521 U.S. at 919 (internal quotations omitted).\n\n                                    -16-\n\facknowledge, neither New York nor Printz affirmatively held that\n\nthe Guarantee Clause could appropriately be invoked on the facts in\n\nthose cases. Both cases, moreover, are easily distinguishable from\n\nthe present case because they involved claims by a state that the\n\nexecutive and legislative branches of the federal government were\n\ninterfering   with    state   matters.     In   this   suit,   by    contrast,\n\nindividuals are attempting to invoke the Guarantee Clause against\n\nstate    officials,   and   federalism    concerns     about   the   scope   of\n\ncongressional authority are simply absent.9\n\n            Most importantly, though, New York and Printz do not\n\nestablish that separation-of-powers violations within a state, such\n\nas those alleged by the plaintiffs, constitute Guarantee Clause\n\nviolations.    Much to the contrary, the Court in New York affirmed\n\nthat the Guarantee Clause (if claims under it are justiciable at\n\nall) is only offended in highly limited circumstances.                It held\n\nthat there was no possible violation of the Clause in that case\n\n\n\n     9\n       Acknowledging the different context in which New York and\nPrintz were decided, plaintiffs draw on academic commentary to\nargue that the Guarantee Clause confers judicially cognizable\nrights on individuals as well as states. See Chemerinsky, supra,\n65 U. Colo. L. Rev. at 851 (the Guarantee Clause is a \"protector of\nbasic individual rights and should not be treated as being solely\nabout the structure of government\"); Debra F. Salz, Discrimination-\nProne Initiatives and the Guarantee Clause: A Role for the Supreme\nCourt, 62 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 100 (1993).       They also rely on a\nKansas Supreme Court decision, VanSickle v. Shanahan, 511 P.2d 223\n(Kan. 1973), which found justiciable (though ultimately non-\nmeritorious) a Guarantee Clause challenge to a state constitutional\namendment abolishing the offices of state treasurer and auditor.\nSee 511 P.2d at 227, 240, 243.\n\n                                   -17-\n\fbecause the states retained \"the ability to set their legislative\n\nagendas\" and \"state government officials remain[ed] accountable to\n\nthe local electorate.\"    505 U.S. at 185.          The same is true here.\n\n           The obvious question here is why the possibility of\n\namending the Massachusetts Constitution, see Mass. Const. amend.\n\nart. XLVIII, against the background of normal election of the\n\nlegislature and governor by voters, is not sufficient to eliminate\n\nany plausible claim of a deprivation of a republican form of\n\ngovernment under the Guarantee Clause. Although the possibility of\n\namending   the   constitution    is    not    the   only   safeguard,   it   is\n\ncertainly the most direct.\n\n           Plaintiffs respond that the change in the definition of\n\nmarriage is so momentous that it overshadows either of these checks\n\navailable to the citizens of Massachusetts for two reasons. First,\n\nany amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution will take roughly\n\ntwo years to come into effect.               Second, relying on the SJC's\n\nlanguage in Albano v. Attorney General, 769 N.E.2d 1242, 1246\n\n(2002), the plaintiffs contend that the SJC would not permit a\n\nconstitutional amendment to render ineffective actions taken before\n\nthe date of the amendment.      Thus, conclude the plaintiffs, even an\n\namendment would not void Goodridge, so there is no way to undo the\n\neffect of Goodridge between its implementation and the passage of\n\na subsequent initiative amendment.           As a result, plaintiffs argue\n\nthat \"in the interim, [they] suffer loss of their representative\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fform of government in the same way they would suffer loss if the\n\nSJC had abolished the legislature.\"\n\n             This argument goes too far.          The SJC has not abolished\n\nthe    legislature.         The   amendment   process      enshrined     in   the\n\nMassachusetts Constitution is purposely designed to be slow; that\n\nchoice is itself a result of the state's republican form of\n\ngovernment.    Moreover, even were the plaintiffs' reading of Albano\n\ncorrect, an issue we do not decide, then the inability of a\n\nconstitutional amendment to void Goodridge retroactively is also\n\nthe result of a republican form of government in action.                  It was\n\nthe Massachusetts people who amended the state constitution in 1918\n\nto provide for certain limitations in the process of constitutional\n\namendment.     See Mass. Const. amend. art. XLVIII, pt. II, § 2.\n\n             The resolution of the same-sex marriage issue by the\n\njudicial     branch   of    the   Massachusetts     government,     subject    to\n\noverride by the voters through the state constitutional amendment\n\nprocess, does not plausibly constitute a threat to a republican\n\nform    of   government.          Absent   such    a   threat,     our   federal\n\nconstitutional system simply does not permit a federal court to\n\nintervene in the arrangement of state government under the guise of\n\na federal Guarantee Clause question.              Such an intervention would\n\nitself threaten federal court interference with the very form of\n\ngovernment    that    the   people    of   Massachusetts    have    chosen    for\n\nthemselves.     Perhaps, in unusual and extreme cases, such as the\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\festablishment of a monarchy by a state in place of a republican\n\nform of government, individuals could utilize the federal courts to\n\nenforce the Guarantee Clause.       See The Federalist No. 43, at 311\n\n(J. Madison) (B. Wright ed., 1961) (the Guarantee Clause gives \"the\n\nsuperintending government . . . authority to defend the system\n\nagainst aristocratic or monarchical innovations\").              That is not\n\nthis case.\n\n                                   III.\n\n           We   affirm   the   denial   of   injunctive   and   declaratory\n\nrelief.   No costs are awarded.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\f",

Department of Public Health,</i> 440 Mass. 309, 798 N.E.2d 941 (2003), violated their rights under the Guarantee Clause of the federal Constitution. The SJC, in a divided opinion, held in <i>Goodridge</i> that \"barring an individual from the protection, benefits, and obligations of civil marriage solely because that person would marry a person of the same sex violates the Massachusetts Constitution.\" 798 N.E.2d at 969. As a remedy, the court ordered that the state of Massachusetts recognize the marriage of same-sex couples within six months of the opinion's issuance. <i>Id.</i> at 968-70. The SJC later held that it was an insufficient remedy under the Massachusetts Constitution merely to afford same-sex partners the same benefits as married couples without also recognizing their marriage. <i>See Opinions of the Justices to the Senate,</i> 440 Mass. 1201, 802 N.E.2d 565, 569-72 (2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs, a Massachusetts citizen named Robert Largess and eleven members of the Massachusetts legislature acting as individuals, sought to enjoin the May 17, 2004 implementation of <i>Goodridge</i> and the issuance or recording of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Julie Goodridge and her new spouse Hillary Goodridge, the named plaintiffs in the <i>Goodridge</i> case, along with several others, intervened in the federal action on the side of the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' federal suit asserted that the remedy<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> that the SJC adopted in <i>Goodridge</i> redefined marriage in violation of separation-of-powers principles in the Massachusetts Constitution. Under the state constitution, according to the plaintiffs, it is the prerogative of the state legislature, not the courts, to define the term \"marriage.\" The plaintiffs also asserted that the Massachusetts Constitution itself defines the term \"marriage\" according to its historical meaning as a union between a man and a woman, and thus that <i>Goodridge</i> effected an impermissible amendment of the state constitution that further violated separation-of-powers principles. From the initial premise that the <i>state</i> constitution was violated, the plaintiffs next asserted that the remedy in <i>Goodridge</i> violated their rights under the <i>federal</i> Guarantee Clause of the U.S. Constitution by depriving them of a republican form of government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of their first argument that the SJC usurped the legislature's authority, the plaintiffs relied heavily on one clause of the Massachusetts Constitution:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All causes of marriage, divorce, and alimony, and all appeals from the judges of probate shall be heard and determined by the governor and council, until the legislature shall, by law, make other provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass.

Such a bill, held the SJC, would contravene the principle that the state constitution's \"words are to be given their natural and obvious sense according to common and approved usage at the time of their adoption.\" <i>Id.</i> at 763. Similarly, the plaintiffs argued that by altering the historic meaning of the term \"marriage,\" which is contained in the Massachusetts Constitution, the SJC in <i>Goodridge</i> itself amended the state constitution, a process that normally must be initiated by voters of Massachusetts and acted upon by the legislature, <i>see</i> Mass.

The court concluded that the SJC did, under the Massachusetts Constitution, have the power to redefine marriage and that, in doing so, the SJC did not perform a legislative act. <i>See id.</i> at *13-*18.

Since then, Massachusetts has issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples and has recorded same-sex marriages. Thus, the plaintiffs' desired injunction would now have the effect of stopping this practice after, rather than before, it had begun.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state defendants and the defendant-intervenors raise a series of preliminary objections, some of which involve interesting and difficult issues.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs lack standing because, at most, they share an undifferentiated harm with other voters. <i>Allen v.

But the circumstances of this case present a rare instance in which the standing issue is intertwined and inseparable from the merits of the underlying claim. If the plaintiffs are correct that the Guarantee Clause extends rights to individuals in at least some circumstances,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> then the usual standing inquiry &#8212; which distinguishes between concrete injuries and injuries that are merely abstract and undifferentiated &#8212; might well be adjusted to the nature of the claimed injury. <i>Cf. Flast v. Cohen,</i> 392 U.S. 83, 105-06, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968) (in certain circumstances, federal taxpayers have standing to raise Establishment Clause claims against congressional acts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second preliminary objection made by the defendants is that Guarantee Clause claims are <i>always</i> non-justiciable under the political question doctrine<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and related caselaw. <i>See Luther v. Borden,</i> 48 U.S. (7 How.) 1, 42, 12 L.Ed. 581 (1849) (finding non-justiciable a Guarantee Clause argument by an individual claiming to act under the authority of a state charter government because Congress, not the federal courts, should decide which of two competing Rhode Island governments should be recognized). At oral argument, the state defendants retreated from this absolutist position and acknowledged that there may be extreme cases in which a Guarantee Clause claim would be justiciable, such as those involving \"permanent martial law, [the] declaration of a monarchy, [or] perhaps a hostile takeover of one branch by another.\" Another potential example, defendants acknowledged, might be a case presenting the same facts as this case but in which the state constitution had no mechanism for amendment, so that it was simply beyond the power of the people to alter the SJC's holding. These concessions by the state defendants demonstrate that resolving the issue of justiciability in the Guarantee Clause context may also turn on the resolution of the merits of the underlying claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another preliminary objection advanced by the defendants is that this court should defer to the SJC's resolution of the Massachusetts constitutional law questions raised by the plaintiffs. Because the claimed federal Guarantee Clause violation here depends on supposed <i>state</i> constitutional violations that the SJC has specifically rejected, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs cannot establish a necessary premise to their federal case. The defendants are correct that federal courts should generally defer to a state's highest court on issues of state law. <i>See Johnson,</i> 520 U.S. at 916, 117 S.Ct. 1800; <i>Schad,</i> 501 U.S. at 636, 111 S.Ct. 2491; <i>Murdock,</i> 87 U.S. at 590, 87 U.S. 590. But it is at least arguable that the Guarantee Clause might provide an exception to that rule of deference in extreme cases, such as where the members of a state's highest court declared the state to be a monarchy and themselves its regents. This issue ultimately need not be resolved here, because, as we explain below, the plaintiffs have not established a <i>federal</i> Guarantee Clause violation on the facts here, regardless of whether the remedy in <i>Goodridge</i> offends the Massachusetts Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crucial question raised by plaintiffs' case is why the state constitutional violations they allege, assuming they exist, amount to a violation of the federal Constitution's Guarantee Clause. Plaintiffs' argument is that the alleged transgressions of the Massachusetts Constitution have deprived them of a republican form of government by intruding on the people's rights to elect representatives and structure the government. According to the plaintiffs, not every separation-of-powers violation under a state constitution leads to this result, but this one does. Plaintiffs argue that this is because here three conditions have been met: (1) the delegation or limitation of power to one branch in the state constitution is express, (2) there is a \"clear departure\" from the historic status quo, and (3) this \"clear departure\" seriously impairs a representative form of government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the Supreme Court has found Guarantee Clause claims non-justiciable where they were \"`political' in nature and where there [was] a clear absence of judicially manageable standards.\" <i>Reynolds v. Sims,</i> 377 U.S. 533, 582, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964) (citing <i>Baker v. Carr,</i> 369 U.S. 186, 217-32, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962)). In response, plaintiffs say that their own criteria provide the needed judicially manageable standards, but they do not purport to find those standards in Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not the plaintiffs can satisfy their self-tailored test, they simply have no viable Guarantee Clause claim on these facts. First, the text of the Guarantee Clause does not support such a claim. Second, the Supreme Court's caselaw interpreting the Guarantee Clause rejects the plaintiffs' expansive reading of the provision. Third, recognizing the plaintiffs' claim would ultimately undermine the very purposes of the Guarantee Clause, as the Supreme Court has noted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the text of the Guarantee Clause. It provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S. Const. art. IV, &#167; 4. We do not purport to spell out the entire scope or meaning of the Clause's guarantee of a republican form of government. In fact, scholars have interpreted this portion of the Guarantee Clause in numerous, often conflicting, ways. <i>See</i> William M. Wiecek, <i>The Guarantee Clause of the U.S. Constitution</i> 293-303 (1972) (outlining different interpretations of the Guarantee Clause); <i>see also</i> Akhil Reed Amar, <i>The Central Meaning of Republican Government: Popular Sovereignty, Majority Rule, and the Denominator Problem,</i> 65 U. Colo. L.Rev. 749, 749 (1994); Erwin Chemerinsky, <i>Cases Under the Guarantee Clause Should be Justiciable,</i> 65 U. Colo. L.Rev. 849, 864-69 (1994); Henry Paul Monaghan, <i>We the Peoples, Original Understanding, and the Constitutional Amendment,</i> 96 Colum. L.Rev. 121, 164-65 (1996); G. Edward White, <i>Guaranteeing a Republican Form of Government: Reading the Guarantee Clause,</i> 65 U. Colo. L.Rev. 787, 803 (1994). And John Adams himself, twenty years after ratification of the Constitution, confessed that he \"never understood\" what the Guarantee Clause meant and that he \"believ[ed] no man ever did or ever will.\" Letter from John Adams to Mercy Warren (July 20, 1807), <i>quoted in</i> Wiecek, <i>supra,</i> at 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the conflicting views on the precise meaning of the Guarantee Clause, the text itself provides guidance. The first portion of the Clause is only implicated when there is a threat to a \"Republican Form of Government.\" \"Republican\" is commonly defined as \"of, relating to, or having the characteristics of a republic: having the form or based on the principles of a republic.\" <i>Webster's Third New International Dictionary</i> 1928 (1993). \"Republic,\" in turn, is defined as \"a government in which supreme power resides in a body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by elected officers and representatives responsible to them and governing according to law.\" <i>Id.; see also Oxford English Dictionary</i> (2d ed.1989) (defining \"republic\" as \"[a] state in which the supreme power rests in the people and their elected representatives or officers, as opposed to one governed by a king or similar ruler\"). The Guarantee clause does not require a <i>particular</i> allocation of power within each state so long as a republican form of government is preserved. Indeed, the forms of each state government at the time of the adoption of the Constitution varied in terms of separations of powers, <i>see</i> Robert J. Pushaw, Jr., <i>Justiciability and Separation of Powers: A Neo-Federalist Approach,</i> 81 Cornell L.Rev. 393, 408-11 (1996), and are each presumed to have been \"Republican\" within the meaning of the Guarantee Clause, <i>see Minor v. Happersett,</i> 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 162, 175-76, 22 L.Ed. 627 (1874). If there is any role for federal courts under the Clause, it is restricted to real threats to a republican form of government. The allocation of powers, including the amendment powers, set forth in the Massachusetts Constitution, at the time of adoption and now, self-evidently do not violate the Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Comparing the text of the Guarantee Clause to the different text of Article II, &#167; 1, cl. 2 of the U.S. Constitution provides further support for limiting federal court intervention in state separation-of-powers violations, except, perhaps, in the most egregious circumstances. The text of Article II, &#167; 1, cl. 2 provides that \"[e]ach State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct\" electors for President and Vice President. In contrast to the Guarantee Clause, this clause explicitly implicates state separation-of-powers issues by conferring a right or obligation upon one branch of the state government. The extent to which this more explicit text authorizes federal courts to intervene in state separation-of-powers violations is nonetheless far from clear. While several members of the Supreme Court have suggested that federal courts can indeed review the internal allocations of power in a state government under the text of this clause, <i>see Bush v. Gore,</i> 531 U.S. 98, 112, 121 S.Ct. 525, 148 L.Ed.2d 388 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring) (joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas), that argument has been rejected by other members of the Court, <i>see id.</i> at 123-24, 121 S.Ct. 525 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (joined by Justices Ginsburg and Breyer) (\"[N]othing in Article II of the Federal Constitution frees the state legislature from the constraints in the State Constitution that created it.\"). Accordingly, it is not clear whether the text of Article II, &#167; 1, cl. 2 provides a basis for federal courts to review potential state separation-of-powers violations. In the absence of extreme cases, it is hard to understand the much less explicit text of the Guarantee Clause, which does not clearly reference state separation-of-powers issues, generally to authorize such review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court cases addressing the Guarantee Clause confirm what the plain text of the Clause suggests: most disputes concerning the relationship among a state government's constituent branches do not offend the Constitution's guarantee of a republican form of government. The Supreme Court first said as much in <i>Forsyth v. City of Hammond,</i> 166 U.S. 506, 17 S.Ct. 665, 41 L.Ed. 1095 (1897). Responding to a claim that powers belonging to a state legislature were given to the state courts in violation of the Guarantee Clause, the Supreme Court noted that \"[t]he preservation of legislative control in such matters is not one of the essential elements of a republican form of government\" that is guaranteed to the states. <i>Id.</i> at 519, 17 S.Ct. 665. The Court later generalized this point, observing in response to a Guarantee Clause claim that \"[h]ow power shall be distributed by a state among its governmental organs is commonly, if not always, a question for the state itself.\" <i>Highland Farms Dairy, Inc. v. Agnew,</i> 300 U.S. 608, 612, 57 S.Ct. 549, 81 L.Ed. 835 (1937); <i>see also Pac. States Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Oregon,</i> 223 U.S. 118, 150-57, 32 S.Ct. 224, 56 L.Ed. 377 (1912) (Guarantee Clause defense asserted by corporation against state's action to enforce payment of taxes is non-justiciable).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that the Supreme Court has not closed the door to Guarantee Clause claims. They point out that the Court assumed arguendo that the Clause was applicable in <i>New York v. United States,</i> 505 U.S. 144, 185, 112 S.Ct. 2408, 120 L.Ed.2d 120 (1992), and that it used some expansive language to describe the Clause in <i>Printz v. United States,</i> 521 U.S. 898, 919, 117 S.Ct. 2365, 138 L.Ed.2d 914 (1997).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> But as the plaintiffs acknowledge, neither <i>New York</i> nor <i>Printz</i> affirmatively held that the Guarantee Clause could appropriately be invoked on the facts in those cases. Both cases, moreover, are easily distinguishable from the present case because they involved claims by a state that the executive and legislative branches of the federal government were interfering with state matters. In this suit, by contrast, individuals are attempting to invoke the Guarantee Clause against state officials, and federalism concerns about the scope of congressional authority are simply absent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most importantly, though, <i>New York</i> and <i>Printz</i> do not establish that separation-of-powers violations within a state, such as those alleged by the plaintiffs, constitute Guarantee Clause violations. Much to the contrary, the Court in <i>New York</i> affirmed that the Guarantee Clause (if claims under it are justiciable at all) is only offended in highly limited circumstances. It held that there was no possible violation of the Clause in that case because the states retained \"the ability to set their legislative agendas\" and \"state government officials remain[ed] accountable to the local electorate.\" 505 U.S. at 185, 112 S.Ct. 2408. The same is true here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The obvious question here is why the possibility of amending the Massachusetts Constitution, <i>see</i> Mass. Const. amend. art. XLVIII, against the background of normal election of the legislature and governor by voters, is not sufficient to eliminate any plausible claim of a deprivation of a republican form of government under the Guarantee Clause. Although the possibility of amending the constitution is not the only safeguard, it is certainly the most direct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs respond that the change in the definition of marriage is so momentous that it overshadows either of these checks available to the citizens of Massachusetts for two reasons. First, any amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution will take roughly two years to come into effect. Second, relying on the SJC's language in <i>Albano v. Attorney General,</i> 437 Mass. 156, 769 N.E.2d 1242, 1246 (2002), the plaintiffs contend that the SJC would not permit a constitutional amendment to render ineffective actions taken <i>before</i> the date of the amendment. Thus, conclude the plaintiffs, even an amendment would not void <i>Goodridge,</i> so there is no way to undo the effect of <i>Goodridge</i> between its implementation and the passage of a subsequent initiative amendment. As a result, plaintiffs argue that \"in the interim, [they] suffer loss of their representative form of government in the same way they would suffer loss if the SJC had abolished the legislature.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument goes too far. The SJC has not abolished the legislature. The amendment process enshrined in the Massachusetts Constitution is purposely designed to be slow; that choice is itself a result of the state's republican form of government. Moreover, even were the plaintiffs' reading of <i>Albano</i> correct, an issue we do not decide, then the inability of a constitutional amendment to void <i>Goodridge</i> retroactively is also the result of a republican form of government in action. It was the Massachusetts people who amended the state constitution in 1918 to provide for certain limitations in the process of constitutional amendment. <i>See</i> Mass. Const. amend. art. XLVIII, pt. II, &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The resolution of the same-sex marriage issue by the judicial branch of the Massachusetts government, subject to override by the voters through the state constitutional amendment process, does not plausibly constitute a threat to a republican form of government. Absent such a threat, our federal constitutional system simply does not permit a federal court to intervene in the arrangement of state government under the guise of a federal Guarantee Clause question. Such an intervention would itself threaten federal court interference with the very form of government that the people of Massachusetts have chosen for themselves. Perhaps, in unusual and extreme cases, such as the establishment of a monarchy by a state in place of a republican form of government, individuals could utilize the federal courts to enforce the Guarantee Clause. <i>See The Federalist No. 43,</i> at 311 (J. Madison) (B. Wright ed., 1961) (the Guarantee Clause gives \"the superintending government ... authority to defend the system against aristocratic or monarchical innovations\"). That is not this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>affirm</i> the denial of injunctive and declaratory relief.

Rather, they say, the challenge is to the SJC's \"usurping\" the legislature's prerogative to define the term \"marriage\" and to its redefinition of that term in a way that is inconsistent with the understanding held by the framers of the Massachusetts Constitution</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> To obtain preliminary injunctive relief, plaintiffs had the burden of showing (1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that they would suffer irreparable injury if injunctive relief were not issued; (3) that such injury outweighs any harm that would stem from granting injunctive relief; and (4) that the public interest weighs in their favor<i>See R.I. Dep't of Envtl. Mgmt. v. United States,</i> 304 F.3d 31, 45 (1st Cir.2002). The standard is virtually identical for permanent injunctive relief, except that \"the movant must show actual success on the merits of the claim, rather than a mere likelihood of such success.\" <i>K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc.,</i> 875 F.2d 907, 914-15 (1st Cir.1989). The decision whether to grant relief is based on a balancing of the different factors, with likelihood of success playing a pivotal role. <i>See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc.,</i> 102 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> For this reason, there is no merit to the argument of defendant-intervenors (which was not joined by the state defendants) that this appeal is moot because May 17 has come and passed.

As this court noted in<i>Doe v. Bush,</i> 323 F.3d 133 (1st Cir.2003), in the last forty years (now forty-one) the Supreme Court has found a case non-justiciable on the basis of the political question doctrine only twice, and it has explicitly rejected the doctrine in a number of cases. <i>Id.</i> at 140-41.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> For this reason, we do not consider the district court's determination of the state, not federal, law issue of whether the SJC's exercise of jurisdiction and holding in<i>Goodridge</i> were consistent with the Massachusetts Constitution. As the brief for the state defendants filed by the Attorney General of Massachusetts notes, a federal court \"should be wary of... attempt[s] to draw the Court into reviewing the decision of a state's highest court on matters of state constitutional law.\" The district court's approach unnecessarily opened the door, as the state defendants note, to a new way \"for those dissatisfied by state court decisions to seek federal court review,\" by simply labeling their dissatisfaction as a Guarantee Clause claim.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In<i>Printz,</i> the Court noted that the Guarantee Clause \"presupposes the continued existence of the states and ... those means and instrumentalities which are the creation of their sovereign and reserved rights,\" and thus that, through the Guarantee Clause and several other clauses, the states \"retained a residuary and inviolable sovereignty\" when the federal government was established. 521 U.S. at 919, 117 S.Ct. 2365 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Acknowledging the different context in which<i>New York</i> and <i>Printz</i> were decided, plaintiffs draw on academic commentary to argue that the Guarantee Clause confers judicially cognizable rights on individuals as well as states. <i>See Chemerinsky, supra,</i> 65 U.

They also rely on a Kansas Supreme Court decision, <i>Van Sickle v.

Under the state constitution, according to the plaintiffs, it is the prerogative of the state legislature, not the courts, to define the term \"marriage.\" The plaintiffs also asserted that the Massachusetts Constitution itself defines the term \"marriage\" according to its historical meaning as a union between a man and a woman, and thus that <i>Goodridge</i> effected an impermissible amendment of the state constitution that further violated separation-of-powers principles. From the initial premise that the <i>state</i> constitution was violated, the plaintiffs next asserted that the remedy in <i>Goodridge</i> violated their rights under the <i>federal</i> Guarantee Clause of the U.S. Constitution by depriving them of a republican form of government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of their first argument that the SJC usurped the legislature's authority, the plaintiffs relied heavily on one clause of the Massachusetts Constitution:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All causes of marriage, divorce, and alimony, and all appeals from the judges of probate shall be heard and determined by the governor and council, until the legislature shall, by law, make other provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass.

But the circumstances of this case present a rare instance in which the standing issue is intertwined and inseparable from the merits of the underlying claim. If the plaintiffs are correct that the Guarantee Clause extends rights to individuals in at least some circumstances,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> then the usual standing inquiry &#8212; which distinguishes between concrete injuries and injuries that are merely abstract and undifferentiated &#8212; might well be adjusted to the nature of the claimed injury. <i>Cf.

At oral argument, the state defendants retreated from this absolutist position and acknowledged that there may be extreme cases in which a Guarantee Clause claim would be justiciable, such as those involving \"permanent martial law, [the] declaration of a monarchy, [or] perhaps a hostile takeover of one branch by another.\" Another potential example, defendants acknowledged, might be a case presenting the same facts as this case but in which the state constitution had no mechanism for amendment, so that it was simply beyond the power of the people to alter the SJC's holding. These concessions by the state defendants demonstrate that resolving the issue of justiciability in the Guarantee Clause context may also turn on the resolution of the merits of the underlying claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another preliminary objection advanced by the defendants is that this court should defer to the SJC's resolution of the Massachusetts constitutional law questions raised by the plaintiffs. Because the claimed federal Guarantee Clause violation here depends on supposed <i>state</i> constitutional violations that the SJC has specifically rejected, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs cannot establish a necessary premise to their federal case. The defendants are correct that federal courts should generally defer to a state's highest court on issues of state law. <i>See Johnson,</i> 520 U.S. at 916, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118124\"><a href=\"/opinion/118124/johnson-v-fankell/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But it is at least arguable that the Guarantee Clause might provide an exception to that rule of deference in extreme cases, such as where the members of a state's highest court declared the state to be a monarchy and themselves its regents. This issue ultimately need not be resolved here, because, as we explain below, the plaintiffs have not established a <i>federal</i> Guarantee Clause violation on the facts here, regardless of whether the remedy in <i>Goodridge</i> offends the Massachusetts Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crucial question raised by plaintiffs' case is why the state constitutional violations they allege, assuming they exist, amount to a violation of the federal Constitution's Guarantee Clause. Plaintiffs' argument is that the alleged transgressions of the Massachusetts Constitution have deprived them of a republican form of government by intruding on the people's rights to elect representatives and structure the government. According to the plaintiffs, not every separation-of-powers violation under a state constitution leads to this result, but this one does. Plaintiffs argue that this is because here three conditions have been met: (1) the delegation or limitation of power to one branch in the state constitution is express, (2) there is a \"clear departure\" from the historic status quo, and (3) this \"clear departure\" seriously impairs a representative form of government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the Supreme Court has found Guarantee Clause claims non-justiciable where they were \"`political' in nature and where there [was] a clear absence of judicially manageable standards.\" <i>Reynolds v.

First, the text of the Guarantee Clause does not support such a claim. Second, the Supreme Court's caselaw interpreting the Guarantee Clause rejects the plaintiffs' expansive reading of the provision. Third, recognizing the plaintiffs' claim would ultimately undermine the very purposes of the Guarantee Clause, as the Supreme Court has noted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the text of the Guarantee Clause.

IV, &#167; 4. We do not purport to spell out the entire scope or meaning of the Clause's guarantee of a republican form of government. In fact, scholars have interpreted this portion of the Guarantee Clause in numerous, often conflicting, ways. <i>See</i> William M. Wiecek, <i>The Guarantee Clause of the U.S. Constitution</i> 293-303 (1972) (outlining different interpretations of the Guarantee Clause); <i>see also</i> Akhil Reed Amar, <i>The Central Meaning of Republican Government: Popular Sovereignty, Majority Rule, and the Denominator Problem,</i> 65 U. Colo. L.Rev. 749, 749 (1994); Erwin Chemerinsky, <i>Cases Under the Guarantee Clause Should be Justiciable,</i> 65 U. Colo. L.Rev. 849, 864-69 (1994); Henry Paul Monaghan, <i>We the Peoples, Original Understanding, and the Constitutional Amendment,</i> 96 Colum. L.Rev. 121, 164-65 (1996); G. Edward White, <i>Guaranteeing a Republican Form of Government: Reading the Guarantee Clause,</i> 65 U. Colo. L.Rev. 787, 803 (1994). And John Adams himself, twenty years after ratification of the Constitution, confessed that he \"never understood\" what the Guarantee Clause meant and that he \"believ[ed] no man ever did or ever will.\" Letter from John Adams to Mercy Warren (July 20, 1807), <i>quoted in</i> Wiecek, <i>supra,</i> at 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the conflicting views on the precise meaning of the Guarantee Clause, the text itself provides guidance. The first portion of the Clause is only implicated when there is a threat to a \"Republican Form of Government.\" \"Republican\" is commonly defined as \"of, relating to, or having the characteristics of a republic: having the form or based on the principles of a republic.\" <i>Webster's Third New International Dictionary</i> 1928 (1993). \"Republic,\" in turn, is defined as \"a government in which supreme power resides in a body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by elected officers and representatives responsible to them and governing according to law.\" <i>Id.; see also Oxford English Dictionary</i> (2d ed.1989) (defining \"republic\" as \"[a] state in which the supreme power rests in the people and their elected representatives or officers, as opposed to one governed by a king or similar ruler\"). The Guarantee clause does not require a <i>particular</i> allocation of power within each state so long as a republican form of government is preserved. Indeed, the forms of each state government at the time of the adoption of the Constitution varied in terms of separations of powers, <i>see</i> Robert J. Pushaw, Jr., <i>Justiciability and Separation of Powers: A Neo-Federalist Approach,</i> 81 Cornell L.Rev. 393, 408-11 (1996), and are each presumed to have been \"Republican\" within the meaning of the Guarantee Clause, <i>see Minor v. Happersett,</i> 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 162, 175-76, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">627</span></span> (1874). If there is any role for federal courts under the Clause, it is restricted to real threats to a republican form of government. The allocation of powers, including the amendment powers, set forth in the Massachusetts Constitution, at the time of adoption and now, self-evidently do not violate the Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Comparing the text of the Guarantee Clause to the different text of Article II, &#167; 1, cl. 2 of the U.S. Constitution provides further support for limiting federal court intervention in state separation-of-powers violations, except, perhaps, in the most egregious circumstances. The text of Article II, &#167; 1, cl. 2 provides that \"[e]ach State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct\" electors for President and Vice President. In contrast to the Guarantee Clause, this clause explicitly implicates state separation-of-powers issues by conferring a right or obligation upon one branch of the state government. The extent to which this more explicit text authorizes federal courts to intervene in state separation-of-powers violations is nonetheless far from clear. While several members of the Supreme Court have suggested that federal courts can indeed review the internal allocations of power in a state government under the text of this clause, <i>see Bush v. Gore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118395\"><a href=\"/opinion/118395/bush-v-gore/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>, 112, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118395\"><a href=\"/opinion/118395/bush-v-gore/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Accordingly, it is not clear whether the text of Article II, &#167; 1, cl. 2 provides a basis for federal courts to review potential state separation-of-powers violations. In the absence of extreme cases, it is hard to understand the much less explicit text of the Guarantee Clause, which does not clearly reference state separation-of-powers issues, generally to authorize such review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court cases addressing the Guarantee Clause confirm what the plain text of the Clause suggests: most disputes concerning the relationship among a state government's constituent branches do not offend the Constitution's guarantee of a republican form of government. The Supreme Court first said as much in <i>Forsyth v. City of Hammond,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94671\"><a href=\"/opinion/94671/forsyth-v-hammond/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1095</span></span> (1897). Responding to a claim that powers belonging to a state legislature were given to the state courts in violation of the Guarantee Clause, the Supreme Court noted that \"[t]he preservation of legislative control in such matters is not one of the essential elements of a republican form of government\" that is guaranteed to the states. <i>Id.</i> at 519, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">665</span></span>. The Court later generalized this point, observing in response to a Guarantee Clause claim that \"[h]ow power shall be distributed by a state among its governmental organs is commonly, if not always, a question for the state itself.\" <i>Highland Farms Dairy, Inc. v.

They point out that the Court assumed arguendo that the Clause was applicable in <i>New York v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112768\"><a href=\"/opinion/112768/new-york-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span>, 185, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112768\"><a href=\"/opinion/112768/new-york-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span> (1992), and that it used some expansive language to describe the Clause in <i>Printz v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118148\"><a href=\"/opinion/118148/printz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">898</span></a></span>, 919, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118148\"><a href=\"/opinion/118148/printz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Both cases, moreover, are easily distinguishable from the present case because they involved claims by a state that the executive and legislative branches of the federal government were interfering with state matters. In this suit, by contrast, individuals are attempting to invoke the Guarantee Clause against state officials, and federalism concerns about the scope of congressional authority are simply absent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most importantly, though, <i>New York</i> and <i>Printz</i> do not establish that separation-of-powers violations within a state, such as those alleged by the plaintiffs, constitute Guarantee Clause violations. Much to the contrary, the Court in <i>New York</i> affirmed that the Guarantee Clause (if claims under it are justiciable at all) is only offended in highly limited circumstances. It held that there was no possible violation of the Clause in that case because the states retained \"the ability to set their legislative agendas\" and \"state government officials remain[ed] accountable to the local electorate.\" 505 U.S. at 185, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112768\"><a href=\"/opinion/112768/new-york-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2408</span></a></span>. The same is true here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The obvious question here is why the possibility of amending the Massachusetts Constitution, <i>see</i> Mass. Const. amend. art. XLVIII, against the background of normal election of the legislature and governor by voters, is not sufficient to eliminate any plausible claim of a deprivation of a republican form of government under the Guarantee Clause. Although the possibility of amending the constitution is not the only safeguard, it is certainly the most direct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs respond that the change in the definition of marriage is so momentous that it overshadows either of these checks available to the citizens of Massachusetts for two reasons. First, any amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution will take roughly two years to come into effect. Second, relying on the SJC's language in <i>Albano v. Attorney General,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">769</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1242</span></span>, 1246 (2002), the plaintiffs contend that the SJC would not permit a constitutional amendment to render ineffective actions taken <i>before</i> the date of the amendment. Thus, conclude the plaintiffs, even an amendment would not void <i>Goodridge,</i> so there is no way to undo the effect of <i>Goodridge</i> between its implementation and the passage of a subsequent initiative amendment. As a result, plaintiffs argue that \"in the interim, [they] suffer loss of their representative form of government in the same way they would suffer loss if the SJC had abolished the legislature.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument goes too far. The SJC has not abolished the legislature. The amendment process enshrined in the Massachusetts Constitution is purposely designed to be slow; that choice is itself a result of the state's republican form of government. Moreover, even were the plaintiffs' reading of <i>Albano</i> correct, an issue we do not decide, then the inability of a constitutional amendment to void <i>Goodridge</i> retroactively is also the result of a republican form of government in action. It was the Massachusetts people who amended the state constitution in 1918 to provide for certain limitations in the process of constitutional amendment. <i>See</i> Mass. Const. amend. art. XLVIII, pt. II, &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The resolution of the same-sex marriage issue by the judicial branch of the Massachusetts government, subject to override by the voters through the state constitutional amendment process, does not plausibly constitute a threat to a republican form of government. Absent such a threat, our federal constitutional system simply does not permit a federal court to intervene in the arrangement of state government under the guise of a federal Guarantee Clause question. Such an intervention would itself threaten federal court interference with the very form of government that the people of Massachusetts have chosen for themselves. Perhaps, in unusual and extreme cases, such as the establishment of a monarchy by a state in place of a republican form of government, individuals could utilize the federal courts to enforce the Guarantee Clause. <i>See The Federalist No. 43,</i> at 311 (J. Madison) (B. Wright ed., 1961) (the Guarantee Clause gives \"the superintending government ... authority to defend the system against aristocratic or monarchical innovations\"). That is not this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>affirm</i> the denial of injunctive and declaratory relief.

Rather, they say, the challenge is to the SJC's \"usurping\" the legislature's prerogative to define the term \"marriage\" and to its redefinition of that term in a way that is inconsistent with the understanding held by the framers of the Massachusetts Constitution</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> To obtain preliminary injunctive relief, plaintiffs had the burden of showing (1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that they would suffer irreparable injury if injunctive relief were not issued; (3) that such injury outweighs any harm that would stem from granting injunctive relief; and (4) that the public interest weighs in their favor<i>See R.I.

The decision whether to grant relief is based on a balancing of the different factors, with likelihood of success playing a pivotal role. <i>See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v.
