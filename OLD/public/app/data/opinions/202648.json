WATSON, JR.,\n\n                          Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                        v.\n\n     TRANS UNION LLC; NEW CINGULAR WIRELESS SERVICES, INC.,\n\n                          Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                        FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n         [Hon. Gene Carter, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                         Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n               Campbell and Selya, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Charles N. Watson, Jr., on brief pro se.\n     Mark E. Kogan and Kogan, Trichon & Wertheimer, P.C., on brief\nfor appellee Trans Union LLC.\n     Peter D. Klein and Eaton Peabody, on brief for appellee New\nCingular Wireless Services, Inc.\n\n\n\n                                March 1, 2007\n\f           Per Curiam. Plaintiff Charles N. Watson, Jr. is a federal\n\nprisoner who claims to be a victim of identity theft.             Invoking the\n\nFair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681 - 1681x, as\n\nwell as state law, he brought this pro se action against a credit\n\nreporting agency and a telephone company.              He there complained,\n\ninter alia, that credit had been extended in his name to an\n\nimposter   and   that,   as   a   result,   his    credit   report   contained\n\nunfavorable, inaccurate information.             The district court, finding\n\nplaintiff's jumbled claims difficult to follow, ordered him to file\n\nan amended complaint within 20 days setting forth his allegations\n\nin intelligible fashion.          When plaintiff appeared to miss that\n\ndeadline, the court dismissed the state claims (for a separate\n\nreason cited by a magistrate judge), but gave plaintiff one more\n\nopportunity to delineate his FCRA claims.             The amended complaint\n\nthat was subsequently proffered, however, was also deemed to lack\n\nthe requisite clarity. The court accordingly dismissed the federal\n\nclaims as a sanction for noncompliance with its earlier order.\n\nPlaintiff now appeals.\n\n           The challenge to the dismissal of the FCRA claims fails\n\nfor lack of any sustained argument.         Plaintiff's entire discussion\n\non appeal boils down to the following two assertions: (1) in\n\nresponse   to    the   court's    order,    he    submitted   a   \"clear\"   and\n\n\"comprehensible\" and \"concise\" amended complaint that set forth\n\n\"valid arguments\" in \"chronological order\" stating \"cognizable\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fclaims\" that \"warrant relief\"; and (2) such a pro se filing\n\ndeserved liberal construction.       Plaintiff offers no description of\n\nhis claims and no analysis of why dismissal was an inappropriate\n\nsanction.     Instead, he has \"merely ... mention[ed] a possible\n\nargument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do [his]\n\nwork.\"     United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nAs we have repeatedly held, \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory\n\nfashion, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,\n\nare deemed waived.\"      Id. (quoted in United States v. Casas, 425\n\nF.3d 23, 30 n.2 (1st Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1397\n\n(2006)).    And while pro se litigants are held to a less stringent\n\nstandard, see, e.g., Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, 118 F.3d 886, 890 (1st\n\nCir. 1997), they are not immune from these requirements, see, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Nishnianidze, 342 F.3d 6, 18 (1st Cir. 2003);\n\nStrahan v. Coxe, 127 F.3d 155, 172 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n            Plaintiff's challenge to the dismissal of his state\n\nclaims fails for the same reason. The magistrate judge recommended\n\nthat these claims be dismissed on preemption grounds, see 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1681h(e); the district judge held that recommendation in abeyance\n\npending the filing of an amended complaint within 20 days; when no\n\ncomplaint    was   received   by   that    deadline,    the   district   judge\n\ndismissed these claims as recommended; and the amended complaint\n\narrived in the mail shortly thereafter.                On appeal, plaintiff\n\nprotests that the court acted prematurely, inasmuch as application\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fof the \"mailbox rule\" rendered his submission timely. Cf. Casanova\n\nv. Dubois, 304 F.3d 75, 78-80 (1st Cir. 2002) (applying mailbox rule\n\nin § 1983 context).       Whatever the merit of that argument, his brief\n\npresents no substantive challenge to the preemption ruling itself.\n\nThis matter too has thus been forfeited.\n\n             We add that no reason exists to afford plaintiff any\n\nspecial solicitude in this regard.                Given his failure fully to\n\ncomply with the court's June 17, 2005 order, it is not immediately\n\napparent that the sanction of dismissal was an abuse of discretion.\n\nBut   even     if   it   were,      plaintiff's    prospects    of     ultimately\n\nestablishing injury would have been minimal.                   For example, he\n\nadmits that he has not applied for credit during the relevant\n\nperiod   and    will     not   do    so   during    his   remaining     years   of\n\nincarceration.       His principal grievance involves an inaccurate\n\nlisting that has been removed from his credit report.                 None of his\n\nclaims consists of an allegation that creditors are seeking to hold\n\nhim   personally     liable    for    the   fraudulent    charges.       And    his\n\nreference to \"mental duress\" is entirely conclusory.\n\n             In No. 05-2360, the judgment is affirmed.               No. 05-2289,\n\nan earlier interlocutory appeal, is dismissed for lack of appellate\n\njurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f",
