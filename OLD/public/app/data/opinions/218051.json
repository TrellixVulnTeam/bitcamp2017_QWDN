Villa, Assistant Federal Defender, for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Thomas E.\nDelahanty II, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              June 3, 2011\n\f              SELYA,    Circuit    Judge.       Defendant-appellant       Kenneth\n\nThompson      challenges     his    conviction     under     the   Sex   Offender\n\nRegistration and Notification Act (SORNA).                 Pub. L. No. 109-248,\n\ntit. I, §§ 101-155, 120 Stat. 587, 590-611 (2006).                 After careful\n\nconsideration, we affirm.\n\n              The facts are straightforward.           In 2001, the defendant\n\nwas convicted federally of possession of child pornography, and in\n\na parallel state proceeding of gross sexual assault and sexual\n\nabuse of a minor.           He served concurrent prison terms for these\n\noffenses and, in December of 2006, began serving the probationary\n\nportions of those sentences.          He also registered as a sex offender\n\nas required by both federal and Maine law.             See 42 U.S.C. § 16913;\n\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 34-A, § 11223.\n\n              The    next   summer,   the     authorities    learned     that   the\n\ndefendant had violated the conditions of his probation. An attempt\n\nto   arrest     him    at   the    address    listed   in    his   sex   offender\n\nregistration proved fruitless because he no longer lived there.\n\nHis whereabouts were unknown until February of 2008, when he\n\nregistered a motor vehicle in New Mexico.\n\n              In due course, a federal grand jury sitting in the\n\nDistrict of Maine indicted the defendant on a single count of\n\nfailing to register as a sex offender under SORNA.                 See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2250(a).          The defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on\n\nconstitutional grounds, but the district court demurred.                   United\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fStates v. Thompson, 595 F. Supp. 2d 143, 150 (D. Me. 2009).                    The\n\ndefendant subsequently entered a conditional guilty plea, Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 11(a)(2), reserving his right to appeal the denial of his\n\npretrial motion to dismiss.           The district court accepted the plea\n\nand sentenced the defendant to a 37-month incarcerative term. This\n\ntimely appeal followed.\n\n            All of the defendant's claims are constitutional in\n\nnature and engender de novo review. United States v. Volungus, 595\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2010).             We start with his claim that his\n\nconviction offends the Due Process Clause.                This claim has two\n\nparts.    We scrutinize each of these components separately.\n\n            First, the defendant notes that at the time of his\n\ninterstate travel and later failure to register, neither Maine nor\n\nNew Mexico had yet enacted statutes or promulgated regulations\n\nimplementing SORNA.          Thus, he contemplates, he could not have\n\nregistered      under   SORNA.    For    that   reason,   he     says   that   his\n\nconviction offends due process.\n\n            This contention is foreclosed by circuit precedent.                 We\n\nhave     held    squarely     that,    under    SORNA,    \"the     registration\n\nrequirements for sex offenders are neither conditioned on nor\n\nharnessed       to   state   implementation     of   SORNA's     state-directed\n\nmandates.\"       United States v. DiTomasso, 621 F.3d 17, 27 (1st Cir.\n\n2010).    That holding disposes of the defendant's first due process\n\nargument, and anything more would be supererogatory.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f            The defendant's second due process argument also founders\n\non the shoals of circuit precedent. He asserts that the government\n\ncould not prove that he \"knowingly\" violated the statute; after\n\nall,   neither   Maine    nor   New   Mexico    had   notified     him   of    his\n\nobligation to register under SORNA, nor was there any other proof\n\nthat he had actual knowledge that such an obligation existed.                 But\n\nthis assertion rests on the unfounded assumption that section\n\n2250(a) requires a showing of specific intent (i.e., a conscious\n\nflouting of SORNA's registration requirement) rather than merely a\n\nshowing of general intent (i.e., a knowing failure to register,\n\nsimpliciter).    Our decision in United States v. Stevens, ___ F.3d\n\n___, ___ (1st Cir. 2011) [No. 09-2024, slip op. at 7], consigns\n\nthis assertion to the scrap heap.              The defendant's second due\n\nprocess argument therefore fails.\n\n            Next,   the    defendant        argues    that   his    indictment\n\ntransgressed the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3,\n\nbecause Congress lacked power thereunder to enact SORNA.                      This\n\nargument, too, runs up against settled law.              We repeatedly have\n\nupheld SORNA against Commerce Clause challenges.                   See, e.g.,\n\nStevens, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 9]; DiTomasso, 621 F.3d at\n\n26.    These precedents are controlling.\n\n            Finally, the defendant advances a series of arguments\n\npremised on the Ex Post Facto Clause.          U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl.\n\n3.    These arguments are hopeless.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f           We need not tarry.      The defendant insists that using a\n\npre-SORNA conviction to ground the current indictment violates ex\n\npost facto principles.     We do not agree.\n\n           The defendant's position overlooks the reality that new\n\nacts — his interstate travel and subsequent failure to register —\n\ncomprise   elements   of   the   offense   of    conviction.         There   is,\n\ntherefore, no colorable ex post facto claim.           See United States v.\n\nShenandoah, 595 F.3d 151, 158-59 (3d Cir. 2010); United States v.\n\nMay, 535 F.3d 912, 919-20 (8th Cir. 2008).\n\n           In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the\n\ndefendant repeatedly invokes the decision of the Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt of Maine in State v. Letalien, 985 A.2d 4, 7 (Me. 2009)\n\n(discussing   retroactive    application        of   Maine's   sex    offender\n\nregistration and notification law).        Letalien is of no consequence\n\nhere.   Federal jurisprudence, not state jurisprudence, governs the\n\nresolution of ex post facto challenges in federal criminal cases.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez, 630 F.3d 39, 41-42 (1st Cir.\n\n2010) (looking to federal law to analyze ex post facto issue in\n\nfederal criminal case); United States v. Muñoz-Franco, 487 F.3d 25,\n\n55 (1st Cir. 2007) (same); cf. U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2 (\"This\n\nConstitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fin Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land;\n\nand the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby. . . .\").1\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe summarily affirm the defendant's conviction.     See 1st Cir. R.\n\n27.0(c).\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       In all events, the defendant committed his predicate sex\ncrimes in 2001, and Letalien applies only to crimes committed prior\nto the 1999 effective date of Maine's sex offender registration\nstatute.
