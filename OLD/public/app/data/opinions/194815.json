Frangillo,  Assistant United States Attorney, with  whom\n                   \nA. John Pappalardo, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n              \n\n                                         \n\n                        June 24, 1993\n                                        \n\n     Per  Curiam.   Gary Barrows  appeals his  conviction and\n                \n\nsentence for  being a felon in  possession of a  firearm.  18\n\nU.S.C.     922(g)(1).    Barrows was  charged  in  this  case\n\nfollowing  the discovery  of  a  .22  caliber revolver  in  a\n\nvehicle occupied by Barrows and three others during a routine\n\ntraffic stop by two  Boston police officers.  At the  time of\n\nthe  stop, Barrows was  seated on the  back seat of  the car.\n\nAfter approaching the  vehicle, Officer Matthews saw  Barrows\n\nremove the gun from  his waist, toss it onto  the floorboard,\n\nand  kick it  underneath  the car's  front  seat.   All  four\n\noccupants  of the car were  arrested and taken  to the police\n\nstation for booking.\n\n     At  the police  station, Barrows  told the  two officers\n\nthat  his companions  were not  responsible for  the gun  and\n\nBarrows admitted that  it belonged  to him.   As Barrows  had\n\nfour prior felony  convictions, he was  charged with being  a\n\nfelon in  possession  of a  firearm.   Barrows was  convicted\n\nfollowing a jury trial that included the testimony of the two\n\npolice officers.  Thereafter, Barrows was sentenced under the\n\nArmed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C.   924(e), to a mandatory\n\nminimum fifteen-year term of imprisonment, and to three years\n\nof supervised release.  \n\n     In this  appeal,  Barrows first  contends  that  Officer\n\nMatthews' observation of Barrows' possession of the  revolver\n\nis  not independent  evidence  corroborating  his  subsequent\n\n                             -2-\n\nadmissions to ownership, and  that without this testimony the\n\nevidence was insufficient to convict.   Under Opper v. Smith,\n                                                            \n\n348  U.S.  84  (1954),  an extrajudicial  admission  must  be\n\ncorroborated by  independent evidence  in order to  support a\n\nconviction.   Barrows maintains that the testimony concerning\n\nhis physical  possession  of  the  gun does  not  qualify  as\n\n\"independent\" evidence because it came from the same source--\n\nbroadly  construed  by   Barrows  as  encompassing  all   law\n\nenforcement  officials--that  testified  to  his  post-arrest\n\nstatements.\n\n     The  requirement of independence refers to the evidence,\n                                                            \n\nnot to  the source of  the evidence. Opper,  348 U.S.  at 93.\n                                          \n\nTestimony that is otherwise admissible or corroborative \"does\n\nnot  suddenly  become  less admissible  or  corroborative  or\n\nitself in need of corroboration simply because the eyewitness\n\nalso  heard  the  defendant   confess.\"    United  States  v.\n                                                         \n\nO'Connell,  703 F.2d 645,  648 (1st  Cir. 1983)  (emphasis in\n         \n\noriginal).    Since the government in this  case did not rely\n\nsolely on  Barrows' admissions  but instead introduced  other\n\nevidence  of Barrows'  possession  of the  gun, his  argument\n\nbased on Opper must fail.\n              \n\n     Barrows next contends that the record does not establish\n\nthat  he  knowingly and  intelligently  waived  his right  to\n\ntestify at  his trial.  We disagree.  The record reveals that\n\nthe district  court, upon being informed  that Barrows wished\n\n                             -3-\n\nto  testify  against the  advice  of  counsel, fully  advised\n\nBarrows regarding his right  to testify in his defense.   The\n\ndistrict judge  informed Barrows that  his prior  convictions\n\nwould be  brought out  if  Barrows testified,  but that  \"Mr.\n\nHoward [Barrows' lawyer]  can't tell  you what to  do.   It's\n\ngoing to have  to be  your own decision.\"   Pertinently,  the\n\ndistrict court also told Barrows that if he had any questions\n\nhe could raise them with the court, and that unless the court\n\nheard otherwise  it would  assume that whatever  decision was\n\nmade was Barrows' own choice.\n\n     No  more  elaborate procedure  than  this was  required.\n\nNeither  Barrows nor  his  trial counsel  informed the  court\n\nafter this  discussion that Barrows still  wished to testify.\n\nBarrows did not  take the stand.  Given this  record, we must\n\nconclude, as  did the district court,  that Barrows knowingly\n\nand intelligently waived his right to testify in his behalf.\n\n     Finally,  Barrows requests  a remand  for re-sentencing,\n\nclaiming  that he  did not  have a sufficient  opportunity to\n\nreview  his  presentence  report.   Under  Fed.  R. Crim.  P.\n\n32(c)(3)(A),  a criminal  defendant must  be provided  with a\n\ncopy of the presentence  report at least ten days  in advance\n\nof sentencing unless the defendant waives the minimum ten-day\n                    \n\nperiod.   At the outset  of the sentencing  hearing, Barrows'\n\nlawyer  informed the district court that  he had neglected to\n\nfurnish  his client  with a  copy of  the  presentence report\n\n                             -4-\n\nwhich  was timely sent to  Barrows' counsel.   The lawyer did\n\nstate,  however, that he had reviewed the report with Barrows\n\non  previous occasions.   The district court then recessed in\n\norder to allow Barrows to read the report.\n\n     When  the hearing re-convened,  Barrows' lawyer informed\n\nthe  court that he had reviewed the report with Barrows \"page\n\nby page.\"   Neither  Barrows nor  his counsel indicated  that\n\nthey needed additional time  to go over the  report.  In  our\n\nview,  the failure  to invoke  Rule 32(c)(3)(A) or  request a\n\ncontinuance   effectively  waives   the   claim,   absent   a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.   Here there is no indication  of any\n\nprejudice since  Barrows does  not claim that  his sentence--\n\ndetermined solely on the  basis of his prior convictions--was\n\nwrongly computed.    See  United States v.  Wright, 873  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n437,  445 (1st  Cir.  1989) (late  disclosure of  addendum to\n\npresentence report  was harmless error).   Absent an arguable\n\nerror  in the sentence,  a remand for  re-sentencing would be\n\npointless even if the claim had not been waived.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -5-\n",

Barrows maintains that the testimony concerning\n\nhis physical  possession  of  the  gun does  not  qualify  as\n\n\"independent\" evidence because it came from the same source--\n\nbroadly  construed  by   Barrows  as  encompassing  all   law\n\nenforcement  officials--that  testified  to  his  post-arrest\n\nstatements.\n\n     The  requirement of independence refers to the evidence,\n                                                            \n\nnot to  the source of  the evidence.

Since the government in this  case did not rely\n\nsolely on  Barrows' admissions  but instead introduced  other\n\nevidence  of Barrows'  possession  of the  gun, his  argument\n\nbased on Opper must fail.\n              \n\n     Barrows next contends that the record does not establish\n\nthat  he  knowingly and  intelligently  waived  his right  to\n\ntestify at  his trial.  We disagree.  The record reveals that\n\nthe district  court, upon being informed  that Barrows wished\n\n                             -3-\n\nto  testify  against the  advice  of  counsel, fully  advised\n\nBarrows regarding his right  to testify in his defense.   The\n\ndistrict judge  informed Barrows that  his prior  convictions\n\nwould be  brought out  if  Barrows testified,  but that  \"Mr.\n\nHoward [Barrows' lawyer]  can't tell  you what to  do.   It's\n\ngoing to have  to be  your own decision.\"   Pertinently,  the\n\ndistrict court also told Barrows that if he had any questions\n\nhe could raise them with the court, and that unless the court\n\nheard otherwise  it would  assume that whatever  decision was\n\nmade was Barrows' own choice.\n\n     No  more  elaborate procedure  than  this was  required.\n\nNeither  Barrows nor  his  trial counsel  informed the  court\n\nafter this  discussion that Barrows still  wished to testify.\n\nBarrows did not  take the stand.  Given this  record, we must\n\nconclude, as  did the district court,  that Barrows knowingly\n\nand intelligently waived his right to testify in his behalf.\n\n     Finally,  Barrows requests  a remand  for re-sentencing,\n\nclaiming  that he  did not  have a sufficient  opportunity to\n\nreview  his  presentence  report.   Under  Fed.  R. Crim.  P.\n\n32(c)(3)(A),  a criminal  defendant must  be provided  with a\n\ncopy of the presentence  report at least ten days  in advance\n\nof sentencing unless the defendant waives the minimum ten-day\n                    \n\nperiod.   At the outset  of the sentencing  hearing, Barrows'\n\nlawyer  informed the district court that  he had neglected to\n\nfurnish  his client  with a  copy of  the  presentence report\n\n                             -4-\n\nwhich  was timely sent to  Barrows' counsel.   The lawyer did\n\nstate,  however, that he had reviewed the report with Barrows\n\non  previous occasions.   The district court then recessed in\n\norder to allow Barrows to read the report.\n\n     When  the hearing re-convened,  Barrows' lawyer informed\n\nthe  court that he had reviewed the report with Barrows \"page\n\nby page.\"   Neither  Barrows nor  his counsel indicated  that\n\nthey needed additional time  to go over the  report.  In  our\n\nview,  the failure  to invoke  Rule 32(c)(3)(A) or  request a\n\ncontinuance   effectively  waives   the   claim,   absent   a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.   Here there is no indication  of any\n\nprejudice since  Barrows does  not claim that  his sentence--\n\ndetermined solely on the  basis of his prior convictions--was\n\nwrongly computed.
