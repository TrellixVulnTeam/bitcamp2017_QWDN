Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Raymond L. Sanchez on brief for appellant.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco,\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Nelson Perez-Sosa, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 19, 2002\n\f              Per Curiam. Appellant pleaded guilty to possession\n\nwith intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A) and 18 U.S.C\n\n§ 2, and was sentenced to 46 months' imprisonment -- less than\n\nhalf    the   statutory    mandatory      minimum.      See    21    U.S.C.   §\n\n841(b)(1)(A).      Despite appellant's statements at the change of\n\nplea    hearing     that    he    was     satisfied     with        his   legal\n\nrepresentation,      he    now   claims    that   his   guilty       plea   was\n\ninvoluntary because his attorney misadvised him to plead guilty\n\nbased on evidence that should have been suppressed and wrongly\ndecided to withdraw a motion to suppress that evidence.\n\n              A guilty plea may be considered unknowingly and\ninvoluntarily entered if, in connection with the decision to\nplead    guilty,   the     defendant    does   not    receive       reasonably\n\neffective assistance of counsel.            See Hill v. Lockhart, 474\n\nU.S. 52, 56-57 (1985).           Although ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claims are not normally appropriate for review on\n\ndirect appeal, particularly where, as here, the claim has not\nbeen raised before the trial court, United States v. Mala, 7\n\nF.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993), we agree with the parties'\n\nassertion that the circumstances fall within the exception for\ncases in which \"'the critical facts are not genuinely in\ndispute and the record is sufficiently developed to allow a\n\nreasoned consideration of an ineffective assistance claim.'\"\nUnited States v. Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d 480, 485 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f1994) (quoting United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st\n\nCir. 1991)).\n\n           The familiar two-part test announced in Strickland v.\nWashington,    466   U.S.    668   (1984),    must    be   satisfied   to\n\ninvalidate a guilty plea based on ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel.   Hill, 474 U.S. 57.      Therefore, to prevail, appellant\nmust overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances,\n\ntrial counsel's advice to withdraw the motion to suppress and\n\nplead guilty might be considered sound strategy.              Id. at 689.\n\nIn addition, appellant must prove that counsel's conduct was\n\nprejudicial -- i.e., that there is a reasonable probability\n\nthat, but for counsel's alleged errors, appellant would not\n\nhave pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\nHill, 474 U.S. at 59.          Accordingly, determination of the\n\nineffective assistance issue turns on the likelihood of success\n\nof the withdrawn motion to suppress. After carefully reviewing\nthe record as well as the parties' submissions on appeal, we\n\nconclude that appellant has failed to show that the motion to\nsuppress was likely to succeed.          Moreover, in light of the\n\nsignificantly reduced sentence appellant received, no doubt due\n\nin part to his agreement to withdraw the motion to suppress and\n\nplead   guilty,      trial   counsel's       advice   seems     eminently\n\nreasonable.\n\n           Appellant having failed to satisfy the Strickland\n\ntest, we reject his challenge to the validity of the guilty\n\nplea.   The judgment is affirmed.        See Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f",
