Mukasey has been substituted for former Attorney General\nAlberto R. Gonzales.\n     **\n          Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge. Frankie Sela, a native and citizen\n\nof Indonesia, seeks review of the denial of his application for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (\"CAT\").         We deny the petition for review.\n\n            Sela entered the United States in October 2000 on a\n\nvisitor visa, which expired in April 2001.                Sela remained in the\n\nUnited States and was served with a Notice to Appear in April 2003.\n\nIn a hearing before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") on May 3, 2005,\n\nSela conceded removability but applied for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and CAT protection, claiming persecution on account of his\n\nChristian religion.\n\n            In support of this application, Sela testified before\n\nanother IJ on January 20, 2006.               He recounted rioting against\n\nChristians in Jakarta in May 1998, which frightened him and his\n\nfamily and might have resulted in some damage to his house.                        That\n\nJune,    Sela    and   his   family   moved    to    a   safer    area,      but   they\n\nencountered rioting there as well.                  They escaped harm on one\n\noccasion by hiding on the roof of their house.                They moved again in\n\nJune 1999, and during the five-day boat trip to their new domicile,\n\na group boarded the vessel and harassed Christians onboard.                        Sela\n\ntestified       that   two   passengers    identified      as    Christians        were\n\ntortured and that one was thrown overboard.               Between June 1999 and\n\nSela's    departure     from   Indonesia      in    October     2000,   no    further\n\nincidents occurred.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f           In an oral opinion issued the same day as the hearing,\n\nthe IJ denied Sela's application for asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval.   He found the asylum petition time-barred, and while he\n\ndeemed Sela's testimony credible, he faulted Sela for failing to\n\nprovide sufficient corroboration.     The IJ concluded that Sela\n\nfailed to demonstrate any past or likely future persecution,\n\npointing to the absence of presumably attainable corroboration and\n\nthe lack of harm to him during these incidents.     The IJ quickly\n\ndisposed of the CAT claim because Sela had not asserted anything\n\nindicative of torture.\n\n           The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") upheld the IJ's\n\ndecision in a May 18, 2007 opinion.   It affirmed the IJ's finding\n\nthat the asylum application was time-barred, a determination that\n\nwe lack jurisdiction to review.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3).   It\n\nnoted that the incidents described by Sela did not rise to the\n\nlevel of persecution and were more indicative of general civil\n\nunrest in the country.   The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's ruling\n\non the CAT claim.\n\n           Sela petitioned this court for review of the BIA's\n\naffirmance.   Petitioner's arguments are not very clear, but even\n\ngiven a liberal reading, they do not present any grounds for\n\nreview.\n\n           \"When the BIA adopts the IJ's opinion and discusses some\n\nof the bases for the IJ's decision, we have authority to review\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fboth the IJ's and the BIA's opinions.\"     Ouk v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d\n\n108, 110 (1st Cir. 2006); see also Ferdinandus v. Gonzales, 504\n\nF.3d 61, 63 (1st Cir. 2007).      We must accept the IJ's and BIA's\n\nfindings of fact \"unless any reasonable adjudicator would be\n\ncompelled to conclude to the contrary.\"     8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).\n\n          With respect to his claim for withholding of removal,\n\nSela bears the burden of proving that his \"life or freedom would be\n\nthreatened in [Indonesia] on account of . . . [his] religion.\"       8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.16(b).    This requires demonstrating that it is \"more\n\nlikely than not\" that he will be persecuted in the future based on\n\nhis religion.   Id. § 208.16(b)(2).     A showing of past persecution\n\ncreates a rebuttable presumption of future persecution.             Id.\n\n§ 208.16(b)(1)(i).    In this case, the IJ and BIA reasonably found\n\nthat petitioner had failed to establish past persecution or a clear\n\nprobability of future persecution.\n\n          First,     \"isolated   incident[s]   without   violence   or\n\ndetention\" do not constitute persecution under the regulations.\n\nFerdinandus, 504 F.3d at 63; see also Pieterson v. Ashcroft, 364\n\nF.3d 38, 45 (1st Cir. 2004) (petitioner who was \"never physically\n\nharmed, detained, or arrested\" did not allege facts amounting to\n\npersecution).   While petitioner and his family might have feared\n\nfor their safety, no one was physically mistreated and any damage\n\nto their property was minimal.     \"[P]ast persecution requires that\n\nthe totality of a petitioner's experiences add up to more than mere\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fdiscomfiture, unpleasantness, harassment, or unfair treatment.\"\n\nNikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             Second,    the   IJ   and    BIA   reasonably   concluded    that\n\npetitioner had not demonstrated a likelihood of future persecution.\n\nAt   best,    Sela   has   alleged   general,    sporadic    violence    toward\n\nChristians in Indonesia.           This court has held that it is not\n\nenough to point to \"general reports that some members of a certain\n\ngroup are persecuted in a country\" to establish that petitioner\n\nhimself is more likely than not to suffer such persecution upon his\n\nreturn.      Melhem v. Gonzales, 500 F.3d 78, 82 (1st Cir. 2007); see\n\nalso Awad v. Gonzales, 463 F.3d 73, 77 (1st Cir. 2006); Pieterson,\n\n364 F.3d at 44.        Members of Sela's family have also remained in\n\nIndonesia without incident.          See, e.g., Ferdindandus, 504 F.3d at\n\n63; Melhem, 500 F.3d at 82; Ouk, 464 F.3d at 111; Chahid Hayek v.\n\nGonzales, 445 F.3d 501, 509 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n             As for petitioner's CAT claim, he did not raise the issue\n\non appeal to the BIA and has thus not exhausted his administrative\n\nremedies, precluding our review.           Ouk, 464 F.3d at 111.\n\n             The petition for review is denied with respect to Sela's\n\nclaim for withholding of removal and is dismissed for lack of\n\njurisdiction with respect to his asylum and CAT claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f",
