Radzely, Solicitor of Labor, Joseph M. Woodward,\nAssociate Solicitor of Occupational Safety and Health and Ann\nRosenthal, Counsel for Appellate Litigation, were on brief, for\nRespondent.\n\n\n\n                                April 18, 2005\n\f           Per Curiam. Sturm Ruger & Co. petitions for review of an\n\norder of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (the\nCommission) denying its motion to suppress evidence obtained during\n\nan Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) inspection\n\nof one of its establishments.       Sturm Ruger also challenges certain\nof the Commission's discovery rulings.          We deny the petition for\n\nreview.\n                                     I.\n\n             In 1996, OSHA launched an annual survey called the Data\n\nCollection Initiative (DCI).         See 29 C.F.R. ยง 1904.17 (1998).\n\nUnder the DCI, OSHA required certain employers to report the number\n\nof work related injuries and illnesses, as well as the number of\n\nemployees and the number of hours worked during the survey period.\n\nThe   survey   required    that   each    employer   report   the   requested\n\ninformation on a \"per establishment\" basis.           OSHA used the survey\n\ndata to calculate the rate of injury or illness per establishment.\n\nOSHA then used the resulting rates to target certain establishments\n\nfor inspection as part of its Interim Plan for Inspection Targeting\n(ITP).\n\n           Sturm Ruger has manufacturing facilities in Newport, New\n\nHampshire.     Sturm Ruger's Pine Tree Castings Division is housed\n\nwithin one of the buildings at Sturm Ruger's Newport facility.\nPine Tree produces steel investment castings for use by Sturm Ruger\nand third parties.        In April 1997, OSHA sent Sturm Ruger a DCI\n\nsurvey for its Pine Tree establishment.         Sturm Ruger complied with\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fthe survey by providing OSHA all of the requested information for\n\nPine Tree.\n\n          Based on the data provided, OSHA determined that Pine\nTree had a higher than average injury/illness rate and targeted it\n\nfor inspection under the ITP.      In June 1998, two OSHA inspectors\n\nattempted to inspect Pine Tree.      Sturm Ruger management withheld\n\nconsent for the inspection.        Consequently, OSHA requested and\n\nobtained an administrative search warrant from a judge of the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.\n\nWhen the inspectors returned to Pine Tree to execute the warrant,\n\nSturm Ruger again refused them entry and subsequently moved to\n\nquash the warrant in the district court.\n             Sturm Ruger's main argument to quash the warrant was that\nthe regulation authorizing the DCI only permitted OSHA to collect\n\ndata on an \"employer\" basis, and therefore OSHA did not have the\npower to request data solely for an employer's \"establishments.\"\nThe company also argued that the warrant did not comport with the\n\nFourth Amendment requirements for an administrative search.        In\ndetailed opinions, a magistrate judge and a second district court\njudge rejected Sturm Ruger's arguments.     See Sturm Ruger v. United\n\nStates, No. 98-418JD, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22533 (D.N.H. Jan. 22,\n\n1999) (district court opinion); Sturm Ruger v. United States, No.\n\n98-418JD (Dec. 8, 1999) (report and recommendation of magistrate\n\njudge).   Sturm Ruger appealed to this court and sought a stay of\n\nthe inspection.     We denied the stay and eventually dismissed the\n\nappeal.   See Sturm Ruger v. United States, No. 99-1160 (Mar. 4,\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f1999) (order denying stay); Sturm Ruger v. United States, 186 F.3d\n\n63 (1st Cir. 1999) (opinion dismissing appeal).             OSHA subsequently\n\ninspected Pine Tree.         As a result of the inspection, OSHA issued\nSturm Ruger citations for safety violations.\n\n            In accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health\n\nAct's (the Act) review procedures, Sturm Ruger contested the\n\ncitations before an administrative law judge appointed by the\n\nCommission.      In this proceeding, Sturm Ruger reiterated its prior\n\narguments and also claimed that the DCI was unlawful because the\n\nAct only permitted OSHA to collect information from an employer\n\nwhich was \"made and kept\" pursuant to regulations issued by the\n\nSecretary   of    Labor   --    a   putative    prerequisite      that   was   not\nsatisfied   here.      The     administrative     law    judge    rejected     this\nargument (as well as Sturm Ruger's other challenges to the DCI) on\n\nthe ground that Sturm Ruger had provided the survey information\nwillingly and therefore had waived any objection it might have to\nthe DCI.\n\n            Sturm Ruger sought and obtained from the Commission\ndiscretionary review of the administrative law judge's decision.\nThe company repeated its arguments concerning the legality of the\n\nDCI and the unconstitutional nature of the warrant. It also argued\n\nthat it was unfairly denied discovery before the administrative law\n\njudge concerning the legality of the DCI and whether OSHA had\n\nvindictively     targeted      it   for   inspection    under    the   ITP.     The\n\nCommission rejected Sturm Ruger's arguments against the validity of\n\nthe warrant and concluded that, even if the warrant was ultra\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fvires, OSHA obtained the warrant in good faith and therefore was\n\nentitled to introduce any evidence obtained as a result of its\n\nexecution.      The Commission also rejected Sturm Ruger's discovery\ncomplaints because its challenges to the DCI were purely legal and\n\nbecause Sturm Ruger had not made a threshold showing that OSHA\n\nvindictively targeted it for inspection under the ITP.\n                                       II.\n\n             In its petition for review, Sturm Ruger has challenged\n\nthe legality of the DCI, the constitutionality of the warrant, and\n\nthe fairness of the discovery rulings.                It has not, however,\n\nchallenged     the    Commission's    decision   that,      regardless   of   the\n\nlegality of the warrant, suppression of the evidence obtained from\nthe inspection was not required because OSHA obtained the warrant\nin   good    faith.      Indeed,     Sturm   Ruger   only    acknowledged     the\n\nCommission's good faith ruling in its reply brief, after OSHA\nfocused on it as the primary ground for affirming the Commission's\norder.\n\n             A party may not raise an argument for the first time in\na reply brief.        See United States v. Torres, 162 F.3d 6, 11 (1st\n\nCir. 1998); United States v. Nueva, 979 F.2d 880, 885 n.8 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).      Applying this rule is particularly appropriate where, as\n\nhere, the petitioner ignored one of the lower court's (or in this\n\ncase the agency's) clearly stated grounds for decision.                       Cf.\n\nAnheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Caught-on-Bleu, Inc., 105 Fed. Appx. 285,\n\n287 (1st Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (explaining that appellant has an\n\nobligation to address with specificity the grounds for the lower\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fcourt's decision), cert. denied, --U.S.--, 2005 WL 637213 (Mar. 21,\n\n2005).   Sturm      Ruger's    challenge     to   the   good   faith   ruling   is\n\ntherefore most likely waived, see Torres, 162 F.3d at 11, and, at\nbest, is forfeited and only can be considered for plain error, see\n\nUnited States v. Rodriguez-Leon, 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nWe will assume arguendo that plain error review is available.\n\n              For Sturm Ruger to demonstrate plain error, it must show\n\nthat there was a clear error that affected its substantial rights\n\nand undermines the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the\n\njudicial process. See Diaz-Seijo v. Fajardo-Velez, 397 F.3d 53, 55\n(1st Cir. 2005).        Sturm Ruger stumbles at the threshold as it\n\ncannot demonstrate that the Commission's good faith ruling was\nobviously wrong.\n              The parties agree that the exclusionary rule would apply\n\nto evidence obtained from an unlawful OSHA inspection.                 They also\nagree that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule would\napply    to    at   least     some   searches     conducted    pursuant   to    an\n\nadministrative warrant.          See United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897,\n\n918-21 (1984) (explaining the rationale for not applying the\nexclusionary rule to evidence garnered from an unlawful warrant\n\nthat was obtained in objective good faith). Sturm Ruger's position\n\nis that the good faith exception does not apply here because OSHA's\n\nrequest for a warrant was based on an erroneous interpretation of\n\nits legal authority to conduct the inspection.                 The caselaw does\n\nnot support this proposed limitation to the good faith rule.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f           In Trinity Industries v. Occupational Safety & Health\n\nReview Commission, 16 F.3d 1455 (6th Cir. 1994), the Sixth Circuit\n\nconsidered an employer's challenge to an OSHA warrant on the ground\nthat the OSHA regulation authorizing the inspection was illegal.\n\nThe court agreed with the employer that the regulation was unlawful\n\nand that the warrant should not have been issued.    Id. at 1459-60.\n\nThe court nevertheless declined to invoke the exclusionary rule\n\nbecause OSHA had obtained the warrant in objective good faith. Id.\n\nat 1462.   In so ruling, the court pointed out that the warrant\n\napplication was detailed and specific, and that the warrant's\n\nvalidity had been upheld by a magistrate judge and district court\n\njudge before it was executed.         Id; see also Donovan v. Fed.\nClearing Die Casting Co., 695 F.2d 1020, 1022-24 (7th Cir. 1982)\n(admitting evidence seized pursuant to an improper OSHA warrant\n\nbecause the district court had upheld the validity of the warrant\nin pre-execution litigation).\n           This case closely resembles Trinity and Donovan. The\n\nwarrant application that OSHA submitted was detailed and accurate.\nMore importantly, before executing the warrant, OSHA successfully\nlitigated the validity of the warrant before a magistrate and\n\ndistrict court judge and defeated Sturm Ruger's motion to stay the\n\nwarrant's execution in this court.\n\n           There is, however, one significant difference between\n\nthis case and Trinity and Donvoan.      In the latter two cases, the\n\nemployer raised all of its arguments against the validity of the\n\nwarrant in the motion to quash so all issues had been litigated\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fbefore OSHA executed the warrant.        Here, Sturm Ruger raised only\n\nthe employer/establishment argument and the Fourth Amendment claim\n\nin the motion to quash proceeding and reserved the \"number of\nemployees/hours worked\" argument until the Commission proceeding.\n\nWe can base our good faith conclusion on the fact that the warrant\n\nwas upheld in pre-execution judicial proceedings only for the\n\narguments     resolved    in    those      proceedings     (viz.,    the\n\nemployer/establishment argument and the Fourth Amendment argument).\n\nWe   must    consider    independently     whether   the   \"number    of\n\nemployees/hours worked\" argument is so obviously meritorious that\n\nOSHA clearly was not acting in good faith by seeking a warrant\n\nbased on data obtained from the DCI.        See Leon, 468 U.S. at 922\n(stating that good faith exception does not apply if the inspecting\nauthority \"ha[d] no reasonable grounds for believing that the\n\nwarrant was properly issued\").\n            The regulation authorizing the DCI required employers to\nreport to OSHA \"the number of workers . . . employed and [the]\n\nnumber of hours worked . . . for periods designated in the Survey\nForm.\"   29 C.F.R. ยง 1904.17 (1998).      Sturm Ruger argues that this\nrequirement was unlawful because the Act only permits OSHA to\n\nrequire employers to file reports \"on the basis of records made and\n\nkept pursuant\" to regulations promulgated by the Secretary of\n\nLabor,   29 U.S.C. ยง 673(e) (emphasis supplied), and there is no\n\nregulation requiring employers to keep records of the number of\n\nemployees and the number of hours worked per establishment.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f                  Sturm Ruger's contention rests on the statutory language\n\n\"on the basis of records made and kept.\"              It reads this language to\n\nmean       that    reports   required    by   OSHA   must   be   based   solely on\n\ninformation contained in records that the Secretary of Labor\n\nrequires employers to keep.             OSHA reads this language as giving it\n\nflexibility to require the reporting of some information not\n\nrequired to be kept so long as the foundation for the report is\n\ninformation that an employer must maintain.\n\n                  OSHA's reading of the statute is not plainly wrong.\n\nCourts have found that similar \"based on\" language is synonymous\n\nwith \"arising from\" and ordinarily refers to a \"starting point\" or\n\na \"foundation\",           see McDaniel v. Chevron Corp., 203 F.3d 1099,\n\n1111-12 (9th Cir. 2000) (collecting cases), and have resisted\nreading this phrase to mean \"based solely on,\"                   see United States\n\nex rel. Kreindler & Kreindler v. United Tech Corp., 985 F.2d 1148,\n1158 (2d Cir. 1993).          The language in the Act is therefore at least\nreasonably read as granting OSHA a modicum of discretion to require\n\nthe reporting of additional information -- at least where, as here,\nthe foundation for the report is information maintained in records\nwhich employers, by regulation, must keep.1                  See Sierra Club v.\n\n       1\n      There is no dispute that the Secretary of Labor required\nemployers to keep logs on the incidences of work place injuries and\nillnesses. This was the foundational information for the DCI. The\nnumber of employees and the hours worked were background\ninformation that allowed OSHA to generate a rate of injury or\nillness for each establishment. As OSHA explained in its brief,\n\"the raw numbers of injuries and illnesses occurring at a workplace\nwould be meaningless without information on how that number\ncompared to the amount of work performed there.\"\n     Since the inspection of Pine Tree, the Secretary has\npromulgated a regulation requiring employers to keep records of the\n                                          -9-\n\fEPA, 356 F.3d 296, 305-06 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (stating that the\n\nstatutory term \"based on\" unambiguously granted agency discretion\n\nto apply some additional criteria to those stated in the statute).\nThat   being   the   case,   the    Commission     did   not   plainly   err   in\n\ndeclining to suppress the evidence under Leon.\n\n           The only remaining issue is Sturm Ruger's challenge to\n\nthe denial of discovery on its claims that the DCI was illegal and\n\nthat   OSHA    vindictively        targeted   it    for    inspection.         An\n\nadministrative agency's discovery rulings are reviewed for an abuse\n\nof discretion and will be overturned only if the complaining party\n\ndemonstrates prejudice. See Markland v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., 140\nF.3d 1031, 1036 (Fed. Cir. 1998).             \"The extent of discovery to\nwhich a party to an administrative proceeding is entitled is\nprimarily determined by the particular agency . . .\"                Pac. Gas &\n\nElec. Co. v. FERC, 746 F.2d 1383, 1387 (9th Cir. 1984).\n           The Commission's ruling that Sturm Ruger was not entitled\nto discovery on the legality of the DCI was within its discretion.\n\nSturm Ruger has provided only a conclusory statement that it needed\ndiscovery to prove that the DCI was unlawful.              But we fail to see\nhow discovery on this question would have yielded information\n\n\n\n\nnumber of employees and the number of hours worked. See 29 C.F.R.\nยง 1904.32 (2004). We do not believe that the promulgation of this\nregulation demonstrates that OSHA did not act in good faith in\nasking for information before the regulation was adopted on the\nnumber of employees and the number of hours worked. OSHA may well\nhave believed that it had the authority to request this information\nwithout the regulation and that the promulgation of the new\nregulation merely clarified its preexisting authority.\n\n                                      -10-\n\frelevant to whether the regulation creating the DCI violated the\n\nAct.   As the Commission explained, this is a question of law.\n\n           Sturm Ruger also has failed to meet its burden for\noverturning the discovery ruling concerning its claim of vindictive\n\ntargeting under the ITP.    The Commission rejected Sturm Ruger's\n\ndiscovery request because Sturm Ruger \"had not shown a colorable\n\nbasis for [its] claim.\"      We discern nothing improper in the\n\nCommission requiring Sturm Ruger to make a threshold showing that\n\nthe agency acted vindictively in targeting it for inspection.\n\nSimilar requirements exist in analogous areas.   Cf. United States\n\nv. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 468-69 (1996) (holding that the accused\n\nmust make a threshold showing to obtain discovery on a selective\nprosecution claim); Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 171-72 (1978)\n\n(holding that a party must provide an offer of proof of a falsely\n\nprocured search warrant to obtain an evidentiary hearing).   Sturm\nRuger alleged that it was vindictively targeted because it had\nvigorously opposed a prior OSHA initiative, but it provided no\n\nfacts to support this assertion.   The Commission did not abuse its\ndiscretion in concluding that this allegation was insufficient to\nwarrant discovery.\n                               III.\n\n          For the reasons stated, we deny the petition for review\n\nand enforce the Commission's order.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

Sturm Ruger complied with\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fthe survey by providing OSHA all of the requested information for\n\nPine Tree.\n\n          Based on the data provided, OSHA determined that Pine\nTree had a higher than average injury/illness rate and targeted it\n\nfor inspection under the ITP.      In June 1998, two OSHA inspectors\n\nattempted to inspect Pine Tree.      Sturm Ruger management withheld\n\nconsent for the inspection.        Consequently, OSHA requested and\n\nobtained an administrative search warrant from a judge of the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.\n\nWhen the inspectors returned to Pine Tree to execute the warrant,\n\nSturm Ruger again refused them entry and subsequently moved to\n\nquash the warrant in the district court.\n             Sturm Ruger's main argument to quash the warrant was that\nthe regulation authorizing the DCI only permitted OSHA to collect\n\ndata on an \"employer\" basis, and therefore OSHA did not have the\npower to request data solely for an employer's \"establishments.\"\nThe company also argued that the warrant did not comport with the\n\nFourth Amendment requirements for an administrative search.        In\ndetailed opinions, a magistrate judge and a second district court\njudge rejected Sturm Ruger's arguments.     See Sturm Ruger v.

OSHA subsequently\n\ninspected Pine Tree.         As a result of the inspection, OSHA issued\nSturm Ruger citations for safety violations.\n\n            In accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health\n\nAct's (the Act) review procedures, Sturm Ruger contested the\n\ncitations before an administrative law judge appointed by the\n\nCommission.      In this proceeding, Sturm Ruger reiterated its prior\n\narguments and also claimed that the DCI was unlawful because the\n\nAct only permitted OSHA to collect information from an employer\n\nwhich was \"made and kept\" pursuant to regulations issued by the\n\nSecretary   of    Labor   --    a   putative    prerequisite      that   was   not\nsatisfied   here.      The     administrative     law    judge    rejected     this\nargument (as well as Sturm Ruger's other challenges to the DCI) on\n\nthe ground that Sturm Ruger had provided the survey information\nwillingly and therefore had waived any objection it might have to\nthe DCI.\n\n            Sturm Ruger sought and obtained from the Commission\ndiscretionary review of the administrative law judge's decision.\nThe company repeated its arguments concerning the legality of the\n\nDCI and the unconstitutional nature of the warrant. It also argued\n\nthat it was unfairly denied discovery before the administrative law\n\njudge concerning the legality of the DCI and whether OSHA had\n\nvindictively     targeted      it   for   inspection    under    the   ITP.     The\n\nCommission rejected Sturm Ruger's arguments against the validity of\n\nthe warrant and concluded that, even if the warrant was ultra\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fvires, OSHA obtained the warrant in good faith and therefore was\n\nentitled to introduce any evidence obtained as a result of its\n\nexecution.      The Commission also rejected Sturm Ruger's discovery\ncomplaints because its challenges to the DCI were purely legal and\n\nbecause Sturm Ruger had not made a threshold showing that OSHA\n\nvindictively targeted it for inspection under the ITP.\n                                       II.\n\n             In its petition for review, Sturm Ruger has challenged\n\nthe legality of the DCI, the constitutionality of the warrant, and\n\nthe fairness of the discovery rulings.                It has not, however,\n\nchallenged     the    Commission's    decision   that,      regardless   of   the\n\nlegality of the warrant, suppression of the evidence obtained from\nthe inspection was not required because OSHA obtained the warrant\nin   good    faith.      Indeed,     Sturm   Ruger   only    acknowledged     the\n\nCommission's good faith ruling in its reply brief, after OSHA\nfocused on it as the primary ground for affirming the Commission's\norder.\n\n             A party may not raise an argument for the first time in\na reply brief.

They also\nagree that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule would\napply    to    at   least     some   searches     conducted    pursuant   to    an\n\nadministrative warrant.

The caselaw does\n\nnot support this proposed limitation to the good faith rule.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f           In Trinity Industries v.

In so ruling, the court pointed out that the warrant\n\napplication was detailed and specific, and that the warrant's\n\nvalidity had been upheld by a magistrate judge and district court\n\njudge before it was executed.         Id; see also Donovan v.

The\n\nwarrant application that OSHA submitted was detailed and accurate.\nMore importantly, before executing the warrant, OSHA successfully\nlitigated the validity of the warrant before a magistrate and\n\ndistrict court judge and defeated Sturm Ruger's motion to stay the\n\nwarrant's execution in this court.\n\n           There is, however, one significant difference between\n\nthis case and Trinity and Donvoan.      In the latter two cases, the\n\nemployer raised all of its arguments against the validity of the\n\nwarrant in the motion to quash so all issues had been litigated\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fbefore OSHA executed the warrant.        Here, Sturm Ruger raised only\n\nthe employer/establishment argument and the Fourth Amendment claim\n\nin the motion to quash proceeding and reserved the \"number of\nemployees/hours worked\" argument until the Commission proceeding.\n\nWe can base our good faith conclusion on the fact that the warrant\n\nwas upheld in pre-execution judicial proceedings only for the\n\narguments     resolved    in    those      proceedings     (viz.,    the\n\nemployer/establishment argument and the Fourth Amendment argument).\n\nWe   must    consider    independently     whether   the   \"number    of\n\nemployees/hours worked\" argument is so obviously meritorious that\n\nOSHA clearly was not acting in good faith by seeking a warrant\n\nbased on data obtained from the DCI.        See Leon, 468 U.S. at 922\n(stating that good faith exception does not apply if the inspecting\nauthority \"ha[d] no reasonable grounds for believing that the\n\nwarrant was properly issued\").\n            The regulation authorizing the DCI required employers to\nreport to OSHA \"the number of workers . . . employed and [the]\n\nnumber of hours worked . . . for periods designated in the Survey\nForm.\"   29 C.F.R. ยง 1904.17 (1998).      Sturm Ruger argues that this\nrequirement was unlawful because the Act only permits OSHA to\n\nrequire employers to file reports \"on the basis of records made and\n\nkept pursuant\" to regulations promulgated by the Secretary of\n\nLabor,   29 U.S.C. ยง 673(e) (emphasis supplied), and there is no\n\nregulation requiring employers to keep records of the number of\n\nemployees and the number of hours worked per establishment.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f                  Sturm Ruger's contention rests on the statutory language\n\n\"on the basis of records made and kept.\"              It reads this language to\n\nmean       that    reports   required    by   OSHA   must   be   based   solely on\n\ninformation contained in records that the Secretary of Labor\n\nrequires employers to keep.             OSHA reads this language as giving it\n\nflexibility to require the reporting of some information not\n\nrequired to be kept so long as the foundation for the report is\n\ninformation that an employer must maintain.\n\n                  OSHA's reading of the statute is not plainly wrong.\n\nCourts have found that similar \"based on\" language is synonymous\n\nwith \"arising from\" and ordinarily refers to a \"starting point\" or\n\na \"foundation\",           see McDaniel v. Chevron Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767676\"><a href=\"/opinion/767676/charles-r-mcdaniel-on-behalf-of-himself-and-all-others-similarly-situated/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1099</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1111-12 (9th Cir. 2000) (collecting cases), and have resisted\nreading this phrase to mean \"based solely on,\"                   see United States\n\nex rel.

The language in the Act is therefore at least\nreasonably read as granting OSHA a modicum of discretion to require\n\nthe reporting of additional information -- at least where, as here,\nthe foundation for the report is information maintained in records\nwhich employers, by regulation, must keep.1                  See Sierra Club v.\n\n       1\n      There is no dispute that the Secretary of Labor required\nemployers to keep logs on the incidences of work place injuries and\nillnesses. This was the foundational information for the DCI. The\nnumber of employees and the hours worked were background\ninformation that allowed OSHA to generate a rate of injury or\nillness for each establishment. As OSHA explained in its brief,\n\"the raw numbers of injuries and illnesses occurring at a workplace\nwould be meaningless without information on how that number\ncompared to the amount of work performed there.\"\n     Since the inspection of Pine Tree, the Secretary has\npromulgated a regulation requiring employers to keep records of the\n                                          -9-\n\fEPA, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 305-06 n.7 (D.C.

But we fail to see\nhow discovery on this question would have yielded information\n\n\n\n\nnumber of employees and the number of hours worked. See 29 C.F.R.\nยง 1904.32 (2004). We do not believe that the promulgation of this\nregulation demonstrates that OSHA did not act in good faith in\nasking for information before the regulation was adopted on the\nnumber of employees and the number of hours worked. OSHA may well\nhave believed that it had the authority to request this information\nwithout the regulation and that the promulgation of the new\nregulation merely clarified its preexisting authority.\n\n                                      -10-\n\frelevant to whether the regulation creating the DCI violated the\n\nAct.
