Garcia, United States Attorney, Sonia I. Torres,\nAssistant United States Attorney, Chief, Criminal Division, and\nTimothy R. Henwood, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                               July 15, 2003\n\f            Per Curiam.    In April 2002, Richard Diaz-Baerga (\"Diaz\")\n\npleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute\n\ncocaine and aiding and abetting the possession of a firearm during\n\nand in relation to a drug trafficking offense.            See 21 U.S.C. §\n\n846, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A).          He appeals the district court's\n\nacceptance of his guilty plea as to the firearms charge, contending\n\nthat the court inadequately explained the charge during his Rule 11\n\nhearing.    We affirm.\n\n                 I.   Factual and Procedural Background\n\n            In February 2001, Diaz and his wife, Keila Medina-Roman\n\n(\"Medina\"), both police officers with the Commonwealth of Puerto\n\nRico Police Department, met with a cooperating witness posing as a\n\ndrug dealer and agreed to assist in the transport of what they\n\nbelieved to be a shipment of cocaine.         Diaz transported a shipment\n\nin March 2001 while carrying a firearm, and Medina provided escort\n\nand protection during the transfer.            Diaz and Medina received\n\n$10,000    for   their   services.     They   later   recruited   two   other\n\nindividuals and participated in a second shipment in June 2001,\n\nreceiving $5,000 each.\n\n            On November 26, 2001, a grand jury indicted Diaz and the\n\nthree other participants.            Diaz was charged in seven counts,\n\nincluding conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute,\n\n21 U.S.C. § 846; aiding and abetting the possession of a firearm\n\nduring and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f924(c)(1)(A)(i); aiding and abetting interference with commerce by\n\nthreats or violence, 18 U.S.C. § 1951; and attempting to possess\n\ncocaine with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. § 846. The indictment\n\nalso included forfeiture allegations.         At his arraignment, Diaz\n\nentered a plea of not guilty on all charges.\n\n          On April 26, 2002, Diaz changed his plea to guilty on two\n\nof the charges -- conspiracy to possess narcotics with intent to\n\ndistribute (Count I) and aiding and abetting the possession of a\n\nfirearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime (Count\n\nII) -- and accepted the forfeiture allegations in the indictment.\n\nThe government agreed to dismiss the remaining charges.       Following\n\na Rule 11 hearing, the district court accepted Diaz's plea.\n\n          Diaz was later sentenced to ten years' imprisonment on\n\nthe conspiracy charge and five years' imprisonment on the firearms\n\ncharge, with these terms to be served consecutively. Diaz was also\n\nsentenced to four years and two years of supervised release on the\n\ntwo   charges,   respectively,     with   the   terms   to   be   served\n\nconcurrently. Diaz was ordered to forfeit $15,000, and to pay a\n\nspecial monetary assessment of $200.      This appeal followed.\n\n                            II.    Analysis\n\n          Diaz   contends   that    the   district   court   failed   to\n\nadequately explain the firearms charge, in particular that the\n\ncarrying or use of the firearm must be \"in relation to\" the drug\n\ntrafficking offense.   He argues that his plea as to that charge was\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fnot intelligent and voluntary, and that he should therefore be\n\nallowed to withdraw it.1    Having failed to raise this issue before\n\nthe district court, Diaz is entitled only to plain error review.\n\nUnited States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 1046, 152\n\nL.Ed.2d 90 (2002); United States v. Hoyle, 237 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   Under this standard, Diaz bears the burden of establishing\n\nthat \"the outcome would likely have been different if the error had\n\nnot occurred.\"    Hoyle, 237 F.3d at 5.      He also must show that the\n\nerror affected substantial rights, and \"seriously affect[ed] the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n\nUnited States v. Gandia-Maysonet, 227 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(quoting    United   States      v.     Olano,    507   U.S.   725,     732\n\n(1993)(alteration in original)); see also Hoyle, 237 F.3d at 5.\n\n           We   consider   the   totality    of   the   circumstances    in\n\ndetermining whether plain error has occurred, and whether Diaz's\n\nplea was voluntary, intelligent, and knowing.           United States v.\n\nHernandez-Wilson, 186 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999). \"What is critical\n\nis the substance of what was communicated by the trial court, and\n\nwhat should reasonably have been understood by the defendant,\n\nrather than the form of the communication.\"             United States v.\n\nCotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Diaz does not challenge his plea on the conspiracy count or\ncontest the forfeiture allegations.\n\n                                      -4-\n\f          Diaz contends that the district court's description of\n\nthe firearms charge, reproduced in the margin,2 improperly led him\n\nto believe that merely carrying a firearm made him guilty of the\n\ncrime.   Considering the colloquy in its entirety, however, the\n\ndistrict court did not misstate the elements of the offense.   The\n\ncourt stated the nexus that the government would have to prove,\n\nnamely that the use or carriage of the firearm facilitated the\n\ndrug-trafficking crime.   United States v. Ortiz de Jesús, 230 F.3d\n\n1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000).     Even if we assume, arguendo, that the\n\ndistrict court's explanation was lacking, Diaz fails to meet his\n\nconsiderable burden of proof under the plain error standard.   For\n\ninstance, Diaz fails to even allege -- let alone prove -- that the\n\noutcome likely would have been different if the firearms charge had\n\nbeen described differently.\n\n\n\n     2\n      THE COURT: Count Two of the indictment charges you with the\nfollowing:   That you knowingly carried a firearm during and in\nrelation to the drug trafficking offense, and that is why you\nknowingly and intentionally joined and acted in the conspiracy that\nwe have just discussed, to possess with intent to distribute in\nexcess of 5 kilos of cocaine. Do you understand that?\n     THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\n     THE COURT: In the context of this case, it means in very\nsimple terms that you, obviously, as a police officer you have\nfirearms, you used them, you carried them while you were committing\nthese crimes, do you understand that?\n     THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\n     THE COURT: And the use and the carrying of these firearms\nwould allow you, to help you in a way to commit the offenses. It's\na lot easier. It's a convenient thing to have firearms when you\nare a drug dealer. Do you understand that?\n     THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\nHr'g Tr. (Apr. 26, 2002) at 10:17-11:22 (Docket No. 139).\n\n                                -5-\n\f          Diaz also contends that the district court erred in\n\nfailing to require him to provide a description of what he had done\n\nto commit the firearms offense. In considering the totality of the\n\ncircumstances surrounding a guilty plea, such a description may be\n\nuseful evidence in defeating a defendant's claim that he lacked\n\nunderstanding of the charges against him. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at\n\n5-6.   The absence of such evidence does not, however, demonstrate\n\nthat the defendant did not understand the charges.
