  "plain_text": "interest in Northlantic remains “unsupported speculation,” which is\n\ninsufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment.           Medina-\n\nMunoz, 896 F.2d at 8.\n\n             With regard to the Stoneham property, the Razzabonis\n\nargue that there are “badges” of ownership indicating that the\n\nDebtor actually maintained an ownership interest in it.               For\n\nexample, the Debtor and his family resided in the property, paid\n\nthe mortgage on the property, filed property damage insurance\n\nclaims on the property, and claimed a homestead exemption for the\n\nproperty in the bankruptcy filings.        But, there is no evidence\n\nshowing that any transfers or concealment occurred in the year\n\nprior   to   the   bankruptcy   filing.   The   Stoneham   property   was\n\npurchased in 1987, and the Debtor began living in the property at\n\nthat time.     Since the property was purchased, it was technically\n\nowned by Massbay, then transferred to Rosario, and then transferred\n\nto Norma at Rosario’s death.      Although the Debtor was a signatory\n\non the original mortgage, he never retained any title of record to\n\nthe property.      Even if there were a plausible argument that some\n\nform of economic interest in the property should be attributed to\n\nthe Debtor, that interest did not accrue in the year preceding the\n\nbankruptcy filing.      Thus, there are no facts alleged that could\n\nreasonably prove that the Debtor concealed his interest in the\n\nStoneham property during the year prior to the bankruptcy filing.\n\nSummary judgment, therefore, is appropriate on this claim.\n\n             Finally, as to the gifts and loans, the Debtor argues\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f",
