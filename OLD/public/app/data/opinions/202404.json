Rosa claims that his Massachusetts\n\nstate      court    conviction   for    murder     in   the   first   degree   and\n\nkidnaping, Commonwealth v. Rosa, 422 Mass. 18 (1996), should be set\n\naside on two grounds. First, Rosa alleges that post-conviction DNA\n\ntesting casts doubt on his original conviction.                       Second, the\n\nprosecution lost two pieces of evidence before DNA-testing could be\n\nperformed.         The district court found that neither ground was a\n\nviable challenge to Rosa's conviction.
