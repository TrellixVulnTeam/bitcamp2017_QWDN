Carlos H. Soto-Cruz appeals the\n\n144-month sentence he received after he pleaded guilty to mail and\n\nsecurities fraud.      See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1348.        Because Soto-Cruz\n\nknowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his sentence\n\nin his plea agreement, we dismiss his appeal.\n\n                                       I.\n\n     Soto-Cruz, who worked his way out of a poor and troubled\n\nchildhood to earn a Ph.D. in philosophy, became a registered\n\nstockbroker in 1989 for Paine Webber.          He later worked for Dean\n\nWitter Reynolds, Inc., which eventually merged with Morgan Stanley.\n\nIn 1991, Soto-Cruz began what turned into a twelve-year-long scheme\n\nto defraud his clients out of at least $58 million.            He advised at\n\nleast ten different individual and institutional clients to invest\n\nin low-risk securities, including mortgage-backed securities issued\n\nby the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA).             He then\n\nfunneled his clients' investments through fictitious corporate\n\naccounts   that   he    opened   and    controlled   and    into   high-risk\n\ninvestments, keeping the profits of the risky investments for\n\nhimself.   Soto-Cruz was able to perpetuate the scheme for nearly\n\nthirteen years, through the Dean Witter/Morgan Stanley merger, and\n\neven while working under several different supervisors.               Soto-\n\nCruz's scheme resulted in actual losses to his clients, including\n\nat least two banks, of more than $10 million.\n\n     Soto-Cruz was indicted for thirty-six counts of mail, wire,\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fand securities fraud in March 2004.           On October 4, 2004, Soto-Cruz\n\nentered into a written plea agreement, in which he agreed to plead\n\nguilty to counts one through twenty (alleging separate counts of\n\nmail fraud) and count thirty-six (alleging securities fraud).                   He\n\nalso agreed to forfeit $51 million worth of real estate and bank\n\naccounts.    The government agreed to dismiss the remaining counts.\n\nThe plea agreement contained a stipulation of the applicable U.S.\n\nSentencing    Guidelines    (USSG)      factors,      including    a   20-level\n\nenhancement   for   an   actual   loss       exceeding   $7    million,   and    a\n\nstipulation to the resulting sentencing range of 121 to 151 months.\n\nThe government agreed to recommend a sentence at the lower end of\n\nthe agreed-upon applicable sentencing range.\n\n     Soto-Cruz entered into the plea agreement after the Supreme\n\nCourt decided Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004). The plea\n\nagreement specifically provided \"that the Court shall impose a\n\nsentence in accordance with the applicable provision(s) of the\n\nSentencing Guidelines\" (Appellant's App. at 52), and stated that\n\nthe \"defendant is aware that the defendant's sentence is within the\n\nsound discretion of the sentencing judge and will be imposed in\n\naccordance with the Guidelines\" (Id. at 53).             Soto-Cruz agreed \"to\n\nwaive all rights under Blakely,\" and \"agree[d] to have his sentence\n\ndetermined under the Sentencing Guidelines.\" (Id.) Finally, Soto-\n\nCruz agreed that if the court \"accept[ed] this agreement and\n\nsentence[d]   him   according     to   its    terms   and     conditions,   [he]\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fwaive[d] and surrender[ed] his right to appeal the conviction and\n\nsentence.\"      (Id. at 62.)\n\n       The district court held a change of plea hearing on October 7,\n\n2004,    and    accepted    Soto-Cruz's        guilty      plea.      Soto-Cruz    was\n\nsentenced in April 2005, after the Supreme Court decided Booker v.\n\nUnited States, 543 U.S. 220 (2005). The district court applied the\n\nGuidelines      as    advisory,   as   required       by    Booker.      Despite   the\n\ngovernment's recommendation for a 121-month sentence, the district\n\ncourt sentenced Soto-Cruz to 144 months of imprisonment after\n\nconsidering the now advisory Guidelines range (121 to 151 months)\n\nand the other 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) sentencing factors.                      Soto-Cruz\n\nappeals his sentence.\n\n       We agree with the government that Soto-Cruz validly waived his\n\nright to appeal his sentence.             \"[P]lea-agreement waivers of the\n\nright to appeal from imposed sentences are presumptively valid (if\n\nknowing and voluntary),\" subject to our inherent power to disregard\n\nthem in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice.                     United States v.\n\nTeeter, 257 F.3d 14, 25-26 (1st Cir. 2001).                    Soto-Cruz \"candidly\n\nadmit[s]       that    he   entered     into    the        waivers    knowingly    and\n\nvoluntarily.\"         (Reply Br. at 11.)        He argues, however, that the\n\ndistrict court's statement at the end of his sentencing hearing –\n\nthat he had the right to appeal his sentence if he thought it to be\n\nillegal or unreasonable – negated the plea waiver. See Teeter, 257\n\nF.3d    at   26-27    (declining   to    enforce      a     plea   agreement   appeal\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fwaiver).\n\n       In Teeter, we were concerned that contradictory statements by\n\na district court about a defendant's right to appeal despite an\n\nappeal waiver may call into question the requirement that a waiver\n\nmust be knowing and voluntary.            In Teeter, the district court\n\nfailed to ensure at the change of plea hearing that the defendant\n\nunderstood the consequences of the appeal waiver, as required by\n\nthe then-recent amendments to Rule 11 governing plea colloquies.\n\nThe court compounded that error at the sentencing hearing by\n\nstating without qualification that the defendant had \"a right to\n\nappeal any sentence I impose.\"       Teeter, 257 F.3d at 27.        We held\n\nthat the district court's failure to discuss the appeal waiver,\n\ncoupled with the inconsistent statements at the sentencing hearing,\n\ncalled into question whether the defendant's surrender of her right\n\nto appeal was sufficiently informed to bind her.          Id.\n\n       In this case, Soto-Cruz \"concede[s] that the Magistrate Judge\n\ncarefully addressed him at the [October 2004] plea hearing to make\n\nsure   he   understood   the   implications    and   consequences   of   the\n\nwaivers.\"    (Reply Br. at 12.)     Consequently, unlike Teeter, there\n\nare no Rule 11 issues or concerns in this case.         At the April 2005\n\nsentencing hearing, the district court informed Soto-Cruz that he\n\ncould appeal his sentence if he thought the sentence violated the\n\nlaw or was unreasonable.       We held in Teeter that\n\n       [w]hile broad assurances to a defendant who has waived\n       [his] appellate rights (e.g., \"you have a right to appeal\n\n                                    -5-\n\f     your sentence\") are to be avoided – they muddy the waters\n     and tend to instill false hope – they do not effect a per\n     se nullification of a plea-agreement waiver of appellate\n     rights.\n\nTeeter, 257 F.3d at 25.     The context in which such a statement is\n\nmade is important to our determination of whether the statement is\n\nsufficiently contradictory to an already agreed-upon, examined, and\n\naccepted appeal waiver so as to render the waiver nugatory.                See\n\nUnited States v. De-La-Cruz Castro, 299 F.3d 5, 11-12 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n     The district court's statement in this case is not such a\n\n\"broad assurance.\"     Rather, its statement about Soto-Cruz's appeal\n\nrights was limited to the appeal of a sentence that Soto-Cruz\n\nthought was in violation of the law or was unreasonable.                 Courts\n\nhave long recognized that appeal waivers do not prevent a defendant\n\nfrom appealing a sentence that would result in a miscarriage of\n\njustice, such as a sentence imposed in violation of the law.               See\n\nUnited   States   v.   Johnson,   347   F.3d   412,   414   (2d   Cir.   2003)\n\n(refusing to enforce appeal waiver against defendant's claim that\n\nhis sentence was based on a constitutionally impermissible factor),\n\ncert. denied, 540 U.S. 1210 (2004); United States v. Andis, 333\n\nF.3d 886, 892 (8th Cir.) (en banc) (recognizing a narrow exception\n\nto the enforceability of an appeal waiver for an allegedly illegal\n\nsentence), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 997 (2003).           Thus, the district\n\ncourt's statement about the limited circumstances under which Soto-\n\nCruz could appeal his sentence does not negate the enforceability\n\n                                    -6-\n\fof his appeal waiver.          See De-La-Cruz Castro, 299 F.3d at 12\n\n(holding that the district court's statement that the defendant\n\ncould appeal his sentence \"under some circumstances\" was correct\n\ninsofar as waivers do not prevent the correction of a miscarriage\n\nof justice, and thus the statement did not negate the defendant's\n\nappeal waiver).\n\n     Alternatively, Soto-Cruz argues that enforcement of the appeal\n\nwaiver would work a miscarriage of justice because the district\n\ncourt    denied   his   request   to    present,     in   a   closed    hearing,\n\nmitigation evidence and evidence of his background.               According to\n\nSoto-Cruz, enforcement of agreed-upon mandatory Guidelines to his\n\npost-Booker sentence would likewise work a miscarriage of justice.\n\n\"The miscarriage of justice reservation 'will be applied sparingly\n\nand without undue generosity.'\"         De-La-Cruz Castro, 299 F.3d at 13\n\n(quoting Teeter, 257 F.3d at 26).            Some considerations that guide\n\nour determination include the clarity, gravity, and character\n\n(i.e., factual or legal) of the error; the impact of the error on\n\nthe defendant and on the government; and whether the defendant\n\nconsented to the result.        Teeter, 257 F.3d at 26.\n\n     We agree with the district court that the proposed mitigation\n\nevidence would not have affected Soto-Cruz's sentence.                 Soto-Cruz\n\nwanted to introduce evidence at the sentencing hearing that tended\n\nto show that others were responsible for part of the losses in an\n\neffort   to   reduce    the   agreed   upon    and   stipulated   to    20-level\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fincrease to his base offense level.        He belatedly claims that he\n\nwas pressured by his supervisors to continue his scheme, and that\n\nthe failure of Morgan Stanley's internal controls to expose his\n\nwrongdoing increased the amount of the losses. Such evidence would\n\nhave been directly contradictory to his signed plea agreement, in\n\nwhich Soto-Cruz agreed that the actual losses from his conduct\n\nexceeded $10 million and further specifically agreed to the 20-\n\nlevel enhancement for a loss of between $7 million and $20 million.\n\nSoto-Cruz also explicitly agreed to the resulting 121- to 151-month\n\nsentencing range.        A defendant waives his right to challenge\n\nsentencing factors when he stipulates to the facts supporting the\n\nsentencing factor. See United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix, 400 F.3d\n\n50, 54 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 106 (2005).         Indeed,\n\nsuch a challenge would likely result in a breach of the agreement\n\nby the defendant.        See United States v. Rodríguez-González, 433\n\nF.3d 165, 168 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[A] special problem exists where .\n\n. . a defendant seems to disavow his stipulations without seeking\n\nto   set   aside   the   plea   agreement.\").   Denying   Soto-Cruz   the\n\nopportunity to introduce evidence that would have contradicted the\n\nstipulations he made in the plea agreement and solemnly affirmed in\n\nopen court at his plea proceeding did not work a miscarriage of\n\njustice.\n\n      We likewise reject Soto-Cruz's claim that the Supreme Court's\n\nBooker decision, issued after Soto-Cruz entered into his plea\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fagreement and before the district court sentenced him, somehow\n\nrenders enforcement of his appeal waiver a miscarriage of justice.\n\nSoto-Cruz explicitly recognized that the constitutionality of the\n\nGuidelines was in question at the time he entered into his plea\n\nagreement, and he agreed to waive his right to appeal his sentence\n\nas well as any claims under Blakely.   Indeed, the Magistrate Judge\n\nadvised Soto-Cruz at his change of plea hearing that the Supreme\n\nCourt had heard argument in Booker the prior Monday, stating that\n\n\"[n]obody knows how the Supreme Court will rule on that, but I do\n\nhave to advise you that in theory you may have several rights . .\n\n. but at this time you are waiving any rights to have the jury\n\ndetermine your sentencing guideline calculations, if that were to\n\nbe the law as determined by the Supreme Court.\"   (Appellee's Br. at\n\n18 (quoting the change of plea hearing).)         When asked if he\n\nunderstood that he was waiving the possibility of the Supreme Court\n\nso holding, Soto-Cruz responded, \"Thoroughly and several times,\n\nyes.\"   (Id.)\n\n     That the Supreme Court decided Booker differently than Soto-\n\nCruz (or most of us) anticipated does not make his plea agreement\n\nunknowing or involuntary.   Indeed, other Courts of Appeals have\n\nheld defendants to appeal waivers that were entered into prior to\n\nBlakely.   See, e.g., United States v. Griffin, 418 F.3d 881, 882\n\n(8th Cir. 2005) (\"The fact that [the defendant] did not anticipate\n\nthe Blakely or Booker rulings does not place the issue outside the\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fscope of his waiver.\" (internal marks omitted)); United States v.\n\nCardenas, 405 F.3d 1046, 1048 (9th Cir. 2005) (rejecting a claim\n\nthat an appeal waiver entered in 2000 was invalidated by Booker's\n\nchange in the sentencing laws because \"a change in the law does not\n\nmake a plea involuntary and unknowing\").       Unlike the defendants in\n\nthose cases, Soto-Cruz was sentenced pursuant to Booker under an\n\nadvisory Guidelines regime.        Because he received the benefit of\n\nBooker, the waiver of any Blakely claims cannot have resulted in a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.\n\n     Nor can Soto-Cruz's claim that his sentence is unreasonable\n\nsatisfy   the   miscarriage   of   justice   exception.   Based   on   the\n\nGuidelines range and the other § 3553(a) factors, the district\n\ncourt imposed a sentence slightly above the middle of the advisory\n\nGuidelines range.    We recently explained that although a within-\n\nGuidelines range is not \"per se reasonable,\" \"the [G]uidelines\n\ncannot be called just 'another factor' in the statutory list.\"\n\nUnited States v. Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(en banc).      Soto-Cruz engaged in a very long-term fraudulent\n\nscheme, using his relationship of trust as a stockbroker to defraud\n\nhis clients and friends, the betrayal of which, in his own words,\n\namounted to treason.      While he is now very remorseful, he only\n\nadmitted to his conduct after being caught. That others within his\n\norganization may have encouraged him or failed to stop him does not\n\nchange his own culpability.          A much belated and half-hearted\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fassertion that \"the boss made me do it\" does not negate the\n\nextensive   acts   Soto-Cruz    took   to   perpetuate   his   fraud.   The\n\nsentence imposed is not unreasonable and does not result in a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.        The appeal waiver is enforced, and the\n\nappeal is dismissed.\n\n     Dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f",

The district court applied the Guidelines as advisory, as required by <i>Booker.</i> Despite the government's recommendation for a 121-month sentence, the district court sentenced Soto-Cruz to 144 months of imprisonment after considering the now advisory Guidelines range (121 to 151 months) and the other 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a) sentencing factors.

He argues, however, that the district court's statement at the end of his sentencing hearing &#8212; that he had the right to appeal his sentence if he thought it to be illegal or unreasonable &#8212; negated the plea waiver. <i>See Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 26-27 (declining to enforce a plea agreement appeal waiver).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Teeter,</i> we were concerned that contradictory statements by a district court about a defendant's right to appeal despite an appeal waiver may call into question the requirement that a waiver must be knowing and voluntary.

The court compounded that error at the sentencing hearing by stating without qualification that the defendant had \"a right to appeal any sentence I impose.\" <i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 27.

The context in which such a statement is made is important to our determination of whether the statement is sufficiently contradictory to an already agreed-upon, examined, and accepted appeal waiver so as to render the waiver nugatory. <i>See United States v. De-La-Cruz Castro,</i> 299 F.3d 5, 11-12 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's statement in this case is not such a \"broad assurance.\" Rather, its statement about Soto-Cruz's appeal rights was limited to the appeal of a sentence that Soto-Cruz thought was in violation of the law or was unreasonable. Courts have long recognized that appeal waivers do not prevent a defendant from appealing a sentence that would result in a miscarriage of justice, such as a sentence imposed in violation of the law. <i>See United States v. Johnson,</i> 347 F.3d 412, 414 (2d Cir.2003) (refusing to enforce appeal waiver against defendant's claim that his sentence was based on a constitutionally impermissible factor), <i>cert. denied,</i> 540 U.S. 1210, 124 S.Ct. 1488, 158 L.Ed.2d 136 (2004); <i>United States v.

Thus, the district court's statement about the limited circumstances under which Soto-Cruz could appeal his sentence does not negate the enforceability of his appeal waiver. <i>See De-La-Cruz Castro,</i> 299 F.3d at 12 (holding that the district court's statement that the defendant could appeal his sentence \"under some circumstances\" was correct insofar as waivers do not prevent the correction of a miscarriage of justice, and thus the statement did not negate the defendant's appeal waiver).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, Soto-Cruz argues that enforcement of the appeal waiver would work a miscarriage of justice because the district court denied his request to present, in a closed hearing, mitigation evidence and evidence of his background. According to Soto-Cruz, enforcement of agreed-upon mandatory Guidelines to his post-<i>Booker</i> sentence would likewise work a miscarriage of justice. \"The miscarriage of justice reservation `will be applied sparingly and without undue generosity.'\" <i>De-La-Cruz Castro,</i> 299 F.3d at 13 (quoting <i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 26). Some considerations that guide our determination include the clarity, gravity, and character (i.e., factual or legal) of the error; the impact of the error on the defendant and on the government; and whether the defendant consented to the result. <i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that the proposed mitigation evidence would not have affected Soto-Cruz's sentence. Soto-Cruz wanted to introduce evidence at the sentencing hearing that tended to show that others were responsible for part of the losses in an effort to reduce the agreed upon and stipulated to 20-level increase to his base offense level. He belatedly claims that he was pressured by his supervisors to continue his scheme, and that the failure of Morgan Stanley's internal controls to expose his wrongdoing increased the amount of the losses. Such evidence would have been directly contradictory to his signed plea agreement, in which Soto-Cruz agreed that the actual losses from his conduct exceeded $10 million and further specifically agreed to the 20-level enhancement for a loss of between $7 million and $20 million. Soto-Cruz also explicitly agreed to the resulting 121- to 151-month sentencing range. A defendant waives his right to challenge sentencing factors when he stipulates to the facts supporting the sentencing factor. <i>See United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix,</i> 400 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 106, 163 L.Ed.2d 119 (2005). Indeed, such a challenge would likely result in a breach of the agreement by the defendant. <i>See United States v. Rodr&#237;guez-Gonz&#225;lez,</i> 433 F.3d 165, 168 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[A] special problem exists where ... a defendant seems to disavow his stipulations without seeking to set aside the plea agreement.\"). Denying Soto-Cruz the opportunity to introduce evidence that would have contradicted the stipulations he made in the plea agreement and solemnly affirmed in open court at his plea proceeding did not work a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We likewise reject Soto-Cruz's claim that the Supreme Court's <i>Booker</i> decision, issued after Soto-Cruz entered into his plea agreement and before the district court sentenced him, somehow renders enforcement of his appeal waiver a miscarriage of justice. Soto-Cruz explicitly recognized that the constitutionality of the Guidelines was in question at the time he entered into his plea agreement, and he agreed to waive his right to appeal his sentence as well as any claims under <i>Blakely.</i> Indeed, the Magistrate Judge advised Soto-Cruz at his change of plea hearing that the Supreme Court had heard argument in <i>Booker</i> the prior Monday, stating that \"[n]obody knows how the Supreme Court will rule on that, but I do have to advise you that in theory you may have several rights ... but at this time you are waiving any rights to have the jury determine your sentencing guideline calculations, if that were to be the law as determined by the Supreme Court.\" (Appellee's Br. at 18 (quoting the change of plea hearing).) When asked if he understood that he was waiving the possibility of the Supreme Court so holding, Soto-Cruz responded, \"Thoroughly and several times, yes.\" (<i>Id.</i>)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the Supreme Court decided <i>Booker</i> differently than Soto-Cruz (or most of us) anticipated does not make his plea agreement unknowing or involuntary. Indeed, other Courts of Appeals have held defendants to appeal waivers that were entered into prior to <i>Blakely. See, e.g., United States v. Griffin,</i> 418 F.3d 881, 882 (8th Cir.2005) (\"The fact that [the defendant] did not anticipate the <i>Blakely</i> or <i>Booker</i> rulings does not place the issue outside the scope of his waiver.\" (internal marks omitted)); <i>United States v. Cardenas,</i> 405 F.3d 1046, 1048 (9th Cir.2005) (rejecting a claim that an appeal waiver entered in 2000 was invalidated by <i>Booker's</i> change in the sentencing laws because \"a change in the law does not make a plea involuntary and unknowing\"). Unlike the defendants in those cases, Soto-Cruz was sentenced pursuant to <i>Booker</i> under an advisory Guidelines regime. Because he received the benefit of <i>Booker,</i> the waiver of any <i>Blakely</i> claims cannot have resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can Soto-Cruz's claim that his sentence is unreasonable satisfy the miscarriage of justice exception. Based on the Guidelines range and the other &#167; 3553(a) factors, the district court imposed a sentence slightly above the middle of the advisory Guidelines range. We recently explained that although a within-Guidelines range is not \"per se reasonable,\" \"the [G]uidelines cannot be called just `another factor' in the statutory list.\" <i>United States v. Jimenez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 518 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc). Soto-Cruz engaged in a very long-term fraudulent scheme, using his relationship of trust as a stockbroker to defraud his clients and friends, the betrayal of which, in his own words, amounted to treason. While he is now very remorseful, he only admitted to his conduct after being caught. That others within his organization may have encouraged him or failed to stop him does not change his own culpability. A much belated and half-hearted assertion that \"the boss made me do it\" does not negate the extensive acts Soto-Cruz took to perpetuate his fraud. The sentence imposed is not unreasonable and does not result in a miscarriage of justice. The appeal waiver is enforced, and the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Dismissed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

He later worked for Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., which eventually merged with Morgan Stanley. In 1991, Soto-Cruz began what turned into a twelve-year-long scheme to defraud his clients out of at least $58 million. He advised at least ten different individual and institutional clients to invest in low-risk securities, including mortgage-backed securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). He then funneled his clients' investments through fictitious corporate accounts that he opened and controlled and into high-risk investments, keeping the profits of the risky investments for himself. Soto-Cruz was able to perpetuate the scheme for nearly thirteen years, through the Dean Witter/Morgan Stanley merger, and even while working under several different supervisors. Soto-Cruz's scheme resulted in actual losses to his clients, including at least two banks, of more than $10 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto-Cruz was indicted for thirty-six counts of mail, wire, and securities fraud in March 2004. On October 4, 2004, Soto-Cruz entered into a written plea agreement, in which he agreed to plead guilty to counts one through twenty (alleging separate counts of mail fraud) and count thirty-six (alleging securities fraud). He also agreed to forfeit $51 million worth of real estate and bank accounts. The government agreed to dismiss the remaining counts. The plea agreement contained a stipulation of the applicable U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (USSG) factors, including a 20-level enhancement for an actual loss exceeding $7 million, and a stipulation to the resulting sentencing range of 121 to 151 months.

Soto-Cruz wanted to introduce evidence at the sentencing hearing that tended to show that others were responsible for part of the losses in an effort to reduce the agreed upon and stipulated to 20-level increase to his base offense level. He belatedly claims that he was pressured by his supervisors to continue his scheme, and that the failure of Morgan Stanley's internal controls to expose his wrongdoing increased the amount of the losses. Such evidence would have been directly contradictory to his signed plea agreement, in which Soto-Cruz agreed that the actual losses from his conduct exceeded $10 million and further specifically agreed to the 20-level enhancement for a loss of between $7 million and $20 million. Soto-Cruz also explicitly agreed to the resulting 121- to 151-month sentencing range. A defendant waives his right to challenge sentencing factors when he stipulates to the facts supporting the sentencing factor. <i>See United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201470\"><a href=\"/opinion/201470/united-states-v-serrano-beauvaix/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></span> (2005). Indeed, such a challenge would likely result in a breach of the agreement by the defendant. <i>See United States v. Rodr&#237;guez-Gonz&#225;lez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201993\"><a href=\"/opinion/201993/united-states-v-rodriguez-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span>, 168 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[A] special problem exists where ... a defendant seems to disavow his stipulations without seeking to set aside the plea agreement.\"). Denying Soto-Cruz the opportunity to introduce evidence that would have contradicted the stipulations he made in the plea agreement and solemnly affirmed in open court at his plea proceeding did not work a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We likewise reject Soto-Cruz's claim that the Supreme Court's <i>Booker</i> decision, issued after Soto-Cruz entered into his plea agreement and before the district court sentenced him, somehow renders enforcement of his appeal waiver a miscarriage of justice. Soto-Cruz explicitly recognized that the constitutionality of the Guidelines was in question at the time he entered into his plea agreement, and he agreed to waive his right to appeal his sentence as well as any claims under <i>Blakely.</i> Indeed, the Magistrate Judge advised Soto-Cruz at his change of plea hearing that the Supreme Court had heard argument in <i>Booker</i> the prior Monday, stating that \"[n]obody knows how the Supreme Court will rule on that, but I do have to advise you that in theory you may have several rights ... but at this time you are waiving any rights to have the jury determine your sentencing guideline calculations, if that were to be the law as determined by the Supreme Court.\" (Appellee's Br. at 18 (quoting the change of plea hearing).) When asked if he understood that he was waiving the possibility of the Supreme Court so holding, Soto-Cruz responded, \"Thoroughly and several times, yes.\" (<i>Id.</i>)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the Supreme Court decided <i>Booker</i> differently than Soto-Cruz (or most of us) anticipated does not make his plea agreement unknowing or involuntary. Indeed, other Courts of Appeals have held defendants to appeal waivers that were entered into prior to <i>Blakely. See, e.g., United States v. Griffin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791415\"><a href=\"/opinion/791415/united-states-of-america-plaintiffappellee-v-tydarryl-griffin/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></a></span>, 882 (8th Cir.2005) (\"The fact that [the defendant] did not anticipate the <i>Blakely</i> or <i>Booker</i> rulings does not place the issue outside the scope of his waiver.\" (internal marks omitted)); <i>United States v. Cardenas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790043\"><a href=\"/opinion/790043/united-states-v-martin-cardenas/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1046</span></a></span>, 1048 (9th Cir.2005) (rejecting a claim that an appeal waiver entered in 2000 was invalidated by <i>Booker's</i> change in the sentencing laws because \"a change in the law does not make a plea involuntary and unknowing\"). Unlike the defendants in those cases, Soto-Cruz was sentenced pursuant to <i>Booker</i> under an advisory Guidelines regime. Because he received the benefit of <i>Booker,</i> the waiver of any <i>Blakely</i> claims cannot have resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can Soto-Cruz's claim that his sentence is unreasonable satisfy the miscarriage of justice exception. Based on the Guidelines range and the other &#167; 3553(a) factors, the district court imposed a sentence slightly above the middle of the advisory Guidelines range. We recently explained that although a within-Guidelines range is not \"per se reasonable,\" \"the [G]uidelines cannot be called just `another factor' in the statutory list.\" <i>United States v. Jimenez-Beltre,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202092\"><a href=\"/opinion/202092/united-states-v-jimenez-beltre/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span>, 518 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc). Soto-Cruz engaged in a very long-term fraudulent scheme, using his relationship of trust as a stockbroker to defraud his clients and friends, the betrayal of which, in his own words, amounted to treason. While he is now very remorseful, he only admitted to his conduct after being caught. That others within his organization may have encouraged him or failed to stop him does not change his own culpability. A much belated and half-hearted assertion that \"the boss made me do it\" does not negate the extensive acts Soto-Cruz took to perpetuate his fraud. The sentence imposed is not unreasonable and does not result in a miscarriage of justice. The appeal waiver is enforced, and the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Dismissed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
