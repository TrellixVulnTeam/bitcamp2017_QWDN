Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                          Boudin, Selya and Dyk,*\n\n                              Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Donald A. Harwood for petitioner.\n     Scott A. Katz, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Bureau,\nwith whom Martha Coakley, Attorney General, was on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n                             September 4, 2008\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           Per Curiam.     Petitioner Robin Raposa appeals from the\n\ndistrict court's judgment denying her petition for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus. 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254 (2000).\n\n           Raposa's petition challenged her Massachusetts state\n\ncourt conviction for first degree murder and conspiracy to commit\n\nmurder in connection with the death of her husband, Robert Raposa.\n\nAlthough the district court denied relief, it granted a certificate\n\nof appealability on several of Raposa claims of asserted error:\n\nspecifically, that the prosecutor's summation violated Raposa's due\n\nprocess   rights,    as   did   aspects    of    the   prosecutor's   cross-\n\nexamination and the state court's subsequent admission of allegedly\n\nprejudicial evidence.\n\n           The Commonwealth, in turn, argues that Raposa failed to\n\nexhaust her federal constitutional claims in the Massachusetts\n\nSupreme   Judicial     Court    (\"SJC\").        In   the   alternative,   the\n\nCommonwealth argues that the SJC's decision was neither contrary\n\nto, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal\n\nlaw.\n\n           The district court found that Raposa had exhausted her\n\nfederal claims below, but that there was no error in the SJC's\n\ndecision warranting a grant of the writ.             We have given Raposa's\n\narguments careful consideration but in the end see no reason to\n\ndiffer with, or add to, either part of the district court's\n\nthoughtful and well-reasoned opinion.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\f",
