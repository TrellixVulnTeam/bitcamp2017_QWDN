Having\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we AFFIRM.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n       The Silvas and Defendant-Appellee Ruth Pellegrini are\n\nsiblings.       Their mother died in either 1975 or 1976.                        At the\n\ntime of their mother’s death, Pellegrini and her children\n\nwere    living      with    her   mother    in      the     family        home   at     24\n\nClifford Street, Readville, Massachusetts.                         However, in her\n\nwill, the mother left the Readville home to the Silvas.\n\nThe Silvas, nonetheless, initially agreed that Pellegrini\n\ncould continue to live in the home.                       She did so, paying the\n\nhouse taxes and utilities but no rent.\n\n       In   1976,     the   Silvas    obtained        a    $25,000    loan       from    a\n\nbank, securing that debt with a mortgage on the house at 24\n\nClifford       Street.      The   bank   recorded          the    mortgage       in   the\n\nSuffolk County Registry of Deeds.\n\n       In   1981,     the   Silvas     tried        unsuccessfully          to    evict\n\nPellegrini.         Because she refused to vacate the house, the\n\nSilvas      stopped    making     payments       on       the    mortgage.        As     a\n\nresult, the bank started foreclosure proceedings in February\n\n\n                                       - 2 -\n\f1981.     In order “[t]o avoid losing her home, Ms. Pellegrini\n\npurchased the note” from the bank in May 1981.                 Pellegrini\n\nrecorded     the   bank’s   transfer   of   its   note   to   her   in   the\n\nSuffolk County Registry of Deeds.           The Silvas never made any\n\nmortgage payments to Pellegrini.\n\nA.   Pellegrini’s foreclosure and state action to quiet title\n\n     In 2000, Pellegrini sought to foreclose on the mortgage\n\nshe had purchased from the bank almost twenty years earlier.\n\nPellegrini did so using a non-judicial foreclosure mechanism\n\nprovided for under Massachusetts law — foreclosure by entry.\n\nSee Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 244, §§ 1-2. 1             In compliance with\n\n     1\n         Massachusetts General Laws ch. 244, § 1 provides that\n\n     [a] mortgagee may, after breach of condition of a\n     mortgage of land, recover possession of the land\n     mortgaged by an open and peaceable entry thereon,\n     if not opposed by the mortgagor or other person\n     claiming it, or by action under this chapter; and\n     possession so obtained, if continued peaceably for\n     three years from the date of recording of the\n     memorandum or certificate as provided in section\n     two,   shall  forever   foreclose  the   right  of\n     redemption.\n\nMassachusetts General Laws ch. 244, § 2 further provides:\n\n     If an entry for breach of condition is made without\n     a judgment, a memorandum of the entry shall be made\n     on the mortgage deed and signed by the mortgagor or\n     person claiming under him, or a certificate, under\n     oath, of two competent witnesses to prove the entry\n     shall be made.     Such memorandum or certificate\n     shall after the entry, except as provided in\n     section   seventy  of   chapter  one   hundred  and\n     eighty-five, be recorded in the registry of deeds\n                                              (continued...)\n\n                                 - 3 -\n\fthe Massachusetts foreclosure-by-entry statute, Pellegrini\n\n“entered” the home at 24 Clifford Street, observed by two\n\nwitnesses, and then recorded with the county registry of\n\ndeeds a notice of the foreclosure and a certificate from the\n\ntwo witnesses attesting that the foreclosure by entry had\n\noccurred.        After the expiration of the three-year redemption\n\nperiod that followed the foreclosure, see Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch.       244,   §   1,   Pellegrini     filed   an   action   in   the\n\nMassachusetts Land Court, on September 22, 2003, seeking to\n\nremove any cloud on her title to 24 Clifford Street. 2              The\n\n\n      1\n       (...continued)\n      for the county or district where the land lies,\n      with a note of reference, if the mortgage is\n      recorded in the same registry, from each record to\n      the other.  Unless such record is made, the entry\n      shall not be effectual for the purposes mentioned\n      in the preceding section.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n      2\n     Although Pellegrini had complied with all of the\nstate-law requirements for effecting a foreclosure by entry,\nshe failed to comply with the Massachusetts procedures\nimplementing the federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, 50\nU.S.C. App. §§ 501-96 (Supp. 2009). See generally Beaton v.\nLand Court, 326 N.E.2d 302, 304 (Mass. 1975) (discussing\nMassachusetts statutes implementing the federal Relief Act).\nAmong other things, the federal relief act protects military\npersonnel from foreclosure on their property while they are\non active duty.    See 50 U.S.C. § 533(c) (as revised in\n2003).   Because there is no indication that either of the\nSilvas fell under the protection provided by this federal\nstatute, however, Pellegrini’s failure to comply with the\nMassachusetts procedures implementing the federal relief act\nhad no effect on the validity of the foreclosure.        See\nBeaton, 326 N.E.2d at 305 (noting that, “[i]f a foreclosure\n                                             (continued...)\n\n                                 - 4 -\n\fSilvas defended, arguing among other things that they were\n\nbeing denied their property without due process.                    The Land\n\nCourt rejected that argument, concluding that the statutory\n\nrequirements      for     conducting    a     foreclosure    by   entry   were\n\nsufficient to satisfy due process and that Pellegrini had\n\ncomplied with those statutory requirements.                 The Land Court,\n\ntherefore, entered judgment for Pellegrini, declaring that\n\nshe held title to 24 Clifford Street “free and clear of the\n\n[Silvas’] claims.”\n\n     The Silvas filed a motion seeking reconsideration, which\n\nthe Land Court denied.         But the Land Court apparently failed\n\nto notify the parties of its decision, and the Silvas did\n\nnot discover the denial until four months later, after the\n\ntime to file an appeal had expired.\n\nB.   Silvas’ first federal action\n\n     Because it appeared that the Silvas would be unable to\n\npursue    a    timely     appeal   in   the    state-court    action,     they\n\ninstead       filed   a   complaint     in    federal   court,    naming    as\n\nDefendants Pellegrini, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\n\n\n\n     2\n     (...continued)\nwere otherwise properly made, failure to comply with the\n[Servicemembers Civil] Relief Act would not render the\nforeclosure invalid as to anyone not entitled to the\nprotection of that act”). But there would remain a cloud on\nPellegrini’s title until she filed suit to establish that\nneither Silva was entitled to relief under the federal\nstatute. See id.\n\n                                    - 5 -\n\fand   the    Justices     of   the   Massachusetts         Land      Court.       Soon\n\nthereafter, the Massachusetts Appeals Court agreed to hear\n\nthe Silvas’ untimely appeal from the Land Court decision.\n\nIn light of that, the federal district court dismissed the\n\nSilvas’ federal action, based upon the Younger abstention\n\ndoctrine. 3\n\nC.    State appeal of the Land Court’s decision\n\n      Before      the    Massachusetts       Appeals      Court,       the    Silvas\n\nargued again, among other things, that they had been denied\n\ntheir property without due process.                     That state appellate\n\ncourt upheld the Land Court’s decision, concluding that the\n\nSilvas      had    received      notice     of    the    foreclosure         through\n\nPellegrini’s        compliance       with        the    requirements         of    the\n\nMassachusetts foreclosure-by-entry statute.                       See Pellegrini\n\nv.    Silva,      876   N.E.2d    498    (Table),       2007    WL    3333247,      at\n\n*2-3 (Mass. App. Ct. 2007) (unpublished).                      In light of that,\n\nthe Appeals Court further held that it need not address the\n\nquestion of whether due process requirements even apply to\n\nnon-judicial foreclosures.               See id. at *3.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n     “In   the  absence   of  extraordinary  circumstances,\ninterests of comity and the respect for state processes\ndemand that federal courts should abstain from interfering\nwith ongoing state judicial proceedings.” Esso Standard Oil\nCo. v. Lopez-Freytes, 522 F.3d 136, 143 (1st Cir. 2008)\n(citing, e.g., Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971)).\n\n                                        - 6 -\n\f     The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court denied further\n\nreview.      See Pellegrini v. Silva, 880 N.E.2d 413 (Table)\n\n(Mass. Jan. 31, 2008).              Although the Silvas could have at\n\nthat point sought further relief by filing a petition for a\n\nwrit of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, see\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1257(a), 4 the Silvas did not pursue that avenue\n\nof possible review.\n\nD.   Silvas’ Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion to reopen the first\n      federal action\n\n     In light of their final defeat in Massachusetts state\n\ncourt,     the    Silvas    filed   a    Fed.   R.     Civ.   P.   60(b)   motion\n\nseeking relief from the district court’s earlier decision\n\ndismissing their first federal action.                    The district court\n\ndenied     that    Rule    60(b)    motion.       In    appeal     No.   08-1956,\n\ncurrently        before    this    court,   the      Silvas    challenge     that\n\ndecision.\n\n\n\n     4\n         Section 1257(a), 28 U.S.C., provides:\n\n     Final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest\n     court of a State in which a decision could be had,\n     may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by writ of\n     certiorari where the validity of a treaty or\n     statute of the United States is drawn in question\n     or where the validity of a statute of any State is\n     drawn in question on the ground of its being\n     repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of\n     the United States, or where any title, right,\n     privilege, or immunity is specially set up or\n     claimed under the Constitution or the treaties or\n     statutes of, or any commission held or authority\n     exercised under, the United States.\n\n                                        - 7 -\n\fE.    Silvas’ second federal action\n\n      Less    than     a   week   after   the    Silvas   filed   their    Rule\n\n60(b) motion seeking to reopen their first federal action,\n\nthe Silvas filed a second federal action.                      This time, the\n\nSilvas       sued    Pellegrini       and       the   Commonwealth,       again\n\nchallenging the state-court foreclosure proceedings.                        The\n\ndistrict court dismissed this second federal action under\n\nthe Rooker-Feldman doctrine. 5              The Silvas now appeal that\n\ndecision in appeal No. 08-2559.\n\nII.       DISCUSSION\n\nA.    Appeal No. 08-2559\n\n      We first address appeal No. 08-2559, in which the Silvas\n\nchallenge      the   district     court’s    decision     to   dismiss    their\n\nsecond federal action under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. 6\n\n      1.     Standard of review\n\n      The     Rooker-Feldman       doctrine      implicates     the   district\n\ncourt’s subject-matter jurisdiction.                  See Exxon Mobil Corp.\n\nv. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 544 U.S. 280, 291-92 (2005);\n\nsee also Geiger v. Foley Hoag LLP Ret. Plan, 521 F.3d 60, 65\n\n(1st Cir. 2008).            Therefore, we will review the district\n\n\n      5\n     Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413 (1923); District\nof Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462\n(1983).\n      6\n     Although this is the Silvas’ second appeal in time, it\nmakes sense analytically to address it first.\n\n                                     - 8 -\n\fcourt’s dismissal de novo.                     See Federacion de Maestros de\n\nPuerto Rico v. Junta de Relaciones del Trabajo de Puerto\n\nRico,       410    F.3d    17,   20    (1st     Cir.       2005);   see    also       Puerto\n\nRicans for Puerto Rico Party v. Dalmau 544 F.3d 58, 66 (1st\n\nCir. 2008).\n\n       2.     Application of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine\n\n       28 U.S.C. § 1257 vests the United States Supreme Court\n\nwith     exclusive          “jurisdiction            over     appeals          from    final\n\nstate-court judgments.”                 Lance v. Dennis, 546 U.S. 459, 463\n\n(2006)       (per    curiam);         see    also    Exxon    Mobil,       544    U.S.    at\n\n291-92.           In light of that exclusive jurisdictional grant,\n\n“[t]he Rooker-Feldman doctrine prevents the lower federal\n\ncourts from exercising jurisdiction over cases brought by\n\n‘state-court          losers’         challenging           state-court          judgments\n\nrendered before the district court proceedings commenced.’”\n\nId. at 460 (quoting Exxon Mobil, 544 U.S. at 284)(emphasis\n\nadded).       The Rooker-Feldman doctrine, however, is “confined\n\nto [1] ‘cases brought by state-court losers [2] complaining\n\nof   injuries        caused      by    state-court         judgments      [3]     rendered\n\nbefore       the      district         court        proceedings          commenced       and\n\n[4] inviting district court review and rejection of those\n\njudgments.’”              Lance,      546    U.S.    at     464    (numbering         added)\n\n(quoting          Exxon   Mobil,       544    U.S.    at    284);    see       also    Coors\n\nBrewing       Co.    v.    Mendez-Torres,            562    F.3d    3,    19    (1st    Cir.\n\n\n                                             - 9 -\n\f2009).     Because it is clear in this case that the Silvas\n\nwere the unsuccessful parties in the state-court foreclosure\n\naction, we focus on the remaining three factors set forth in\n\nLance.\n\n            a.         Whether the Silvas’ second federal action\n                      “complain[s] of injuries caused by state-court\n                      judgments”\n\n    It     is    clear    that    the     Silvas’   second   federal     action\n\ncomplains       of    injuries    caused    by   the   state-court     judgment\n\nentered in the Massachusetts foreclosure action.                        In the\n\ncomplaint        in    their     second    federal     action,   the     Silvas\n\nalleged:\n\n    Pellegrini used a state statute (MGL c. 244) in\n    such a way as not to require actual notice of\n    proceedings depriving them of their title to their\n    property . . .\n\n            . . . .\n\n    28. The Silvas raised the federal constitutional\n    due process issue under the Fifth And Fourteenth\n    Amendments at every level of the Massachusetts\n    state courts, but such courts chose not to address\n    the constitutional questions.\n\n    29. There is a real and actual controversy between\n    the parties in that defendant Pellegrini takes the\n    position that the state statute (c. 244) provides\n    for and allows the deprivation of real property\n    without actual and personal notification to the\n    record title holders, and the Silvas contend that\n    any such state law would be unconstitutional on its\n    face and/or as applied to the Silvas or their real\n    property under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\n    to the United States Constitution.\n\n    30.  Moreover, defendant Pellegrini is taking the\n    position that since she followed MGL c. 244, and\n\n                                     - 10 -\n\f       even though the Silvas did not receive actual or\n       personal notification of what she was doing, that\n       under the state statute the Silvas have lost all\n       right, title and interest in their Readville house.\n\n       These alleged injuries stem directly from the judgment\n\nentered in the state foreclosure action upholding the rights\n\nof Ms. Pellegrini to take this very action.

The\n\nFirst Circuit has further concluded that, for Rooker-Feldman\n\npurposes, “when the highest state court in which review is\n\navailable has affirmed the judgment below and nothing is\n\nleft to be resolved, then without a doubt the state court\n\nproceedings have ‘ended.’” 7      Id., at 24.\n\n    In    this   case,   the   state   foreclosure    proceeding     had\n\ncertainly “ended” by the time the state’s highest court, the\n\nMassachusetts     Supreme   Judicial     Court,    denied   the   Silvas\n\nfurther review on January 31, 2008.               See Pellegrini, 880\n\nN.E.2d at 413 (Table).         The Silvas initiated their second\n\nfederal action two months later, on March 25, 2008.                Thus,\n\nthe state-court proceedings had ended, for Rooker-Feldman\n\npurposes, before the Silvas commenced their second federal\n\naction.\n\n          c.      Whether the Silvas’ second federal action\n                 “invit[ed] district court review and rejection\n                 of [the state-court] judgments”\n\n    The Silvas asserted two claims in their second federal\n\naction: 1) seeking a declaration that any state law that\n\n\n    7\n     The First Circuit has also recognized two other\ncircumstances,   not  relevant  here,  when   a  state-court\nproceeding will have “ended” for Rooker-Feldman purposes:\n1) “if the state action has reached a point where neither\nparty seeks further action”; and 2) “if the state court\nproceedings have finally resolved all the federal questions\nin the litigation, but state law or purely factual questions\n(whether   great   or  small)  remain   to  be   litigated.”\nFederacion de Maestros, 410 F.3d at 24-25.\n\n                                - 12 -\n\f“allows    the     deprivation       of    property      without   actual       and\n\npersonal        notice    to   the    record     title     holders      of     real\n\nestate . . . is defective and unconstitutional under the\n\nFifth     and     Fourteenth       Amendments     to     the   United        States\n\nConstitution”; and 2) alleging that Mass.

Enter a temporary restraining order enjoining\n       the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, its courts,\n       counties, towns and any other public officer from\n       in any way enforcing, carrying out or acting upon\n       MGL c. 244 generally or as it is applied to the\n       Silvas and their property.\n\n       2.

Award the Silvas their damages for any\n       unconstitutional application of MGL c. 244 to their\n       real estate in Readville, Massachusetts.\n\n\n                                      - 13 -\n\f       7.   Award the Silvas their costs and legal fees\n       under 42 USC sec. 1988.\n\n       8. Such other relief as the Court deems just and\n       appropriate.\n\n       In order for the district court to grant the Silvas\n\nthis relief that they requested, the district court would\n\nhave “to declare that the state court wrongly decided [the\n\nSilvas’] claim” in the state foreclosure action.                        Davison,\n\n471    F.3d    at     223.       And    “[t]he    Rooker-Feldman        doctrine\n\nprevents [the district court] from doing this.”                        Id.     This\n\nbar applies notwithstanding that the Silvas are asserting in\n\ntheir federal action a federal constitutional claim pursuant\n\nto 42 U.S.C. § 1983.             See Diva’s Inc. v. City of Bangor, 411\n\nF.3d    30,    42-43      (1st   Cir.    2005)    (applying     Rooker-Feldman\n\ndoctrine to § 1983 action, but concluding that doctrine did\n\nnot    deprive      the   federal      district   court   of    subject-matter\n\njurisdiction in that particular case).\n\n       The    Silvas      contend   that    their   second      federal      action\n\nseeks different relief than that sought in the state-court\n\nforeclosure proceedings because, in federal court, they are\n\nchallenging         the    constitutionality        of    the    Massachusetts\n\nforeclosure-by-entry statute.               It may be true that, “if the\n\nplaintiff alleges a constitutional violation by an adverse\n\nparty independent of the injury caused by the state court\n\njudgment,       the       [Rooker-Feldman]        doctrine      does    not     bar\n\n\n                                        - 14 -\n\fjurisdiction.”            Davison, 471 F.3d at 222 (emphasis added).\n\nBut here, the Silvas themselves alleged in their federal\n\ncomplaint that they “raised the federal constitutional due\n\nprocess issue under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments at\n\nevery level of the Massachusetts state courts.”                         Thus, the\n\nSilvas’ federal claim challenging the constitutionality of\n\nthe     Massachusetts         foreclosure-by-entry            statute     is     not\n\n“independent         of    the       injury   caused    by   the    state      court\n\njudgment.”      Davison, 471 F.3d at 222.\n\n       The Silvas counter that the state courts never addressed\n\nthe merits of their due process argument.                          But we cannot\n\nagree.     Both the Land Court and the Massachusetts Appeals\n\nCourt    addressed         and       rejected     the   Silvas’     due   process\n\nargument.\n\n       The Massachusetts Land Court rejected the Silvas’ due\n\nprocess argument by concluding that the recorded certificate\n\nof entry was “adequate and proper notice, and the Silvas\n\ncannot credibly claim that it violates due process.”                            This\n\nconclusion was upheld by the Massachusetts Appeals Court,\n\nwhich noted that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\n\npreviously ruled that the duly recorded entry under Mass.\n\nGen.    Laws   ch.    244,       §   2   provided   “full    and   authoritative\n\nnotice, to all persons,” citing, e.g., Bennett v. Conant, 10\n\nCush. 163, 167 (Mass. 1852).                  Pellegrini, 2007 WL 3333247,\n\n\n                                         - 15 -\n\fat *2.      Full and authoritative notice to all persons would\n\nsatisfy due process notice requirements and, accordingly,\n\nthe Massachusetts Appeals Court apparently felt it was not\n\nnecessary in this case to address whether or not the due\n\nprocess      clause     was     even     applicable           because      of     the\n\npossibility that a foreclosure by entry and recorded notice\n\nmight    not    involve     state   action:        “this    case       presents    no\n\n‘occasion to determine whether the due process clause even\n\nhas      any      applicability          to        nonjudicial            mortgage\n\nforeclosures.’”        Id. at *3 (quoting Beaton, 326 N.E.2d at\n\n307 n.6).      Thus, the Massachusetts courts expressly rejected\n\nthe Silvas’ due process claim.\n\n      Moreover, even if we were to assume the truth of the\n\nSilvas’ allegation that, although they “raised the federal\n\nconstitutional        due     process    issue        under      the    Fifth     and\n\nFourteenth Amendments at every level of the Massachusetts\n\nstate courts,” the state “courts chose not to address the\n\nconstitutional        questions,”       we    would      still    conclude      that\n\nRooker-Feldman bars the Silvas’ second federal action. This\n\ncourt could not grant the Silvas the relief they request\n\nwithout concluding that the Massachusetts state courts erred\n\nin    the      decisions      entered        in    the     state       foreclosure\n\nproceedings.          Cf.   Davison,         471   F.3d    at     223    (applying\n\nRooker-Feldman doctrine after rejecting federal plaintiffs’\n\n\n                                    - 16 -\n\fargument that they never got their “day in [state] court”\n\nbecause of state court’s procedural ruling).                     The ruling of\n\nthe    Massachusetts       Appeals     Court     expressly       rejected      the\n\nSilvas’ due process claim and no federal relief could be\n\ngranted without challenging that state court holding.\n\n              d. Conclusion as to the application of the\n                 Rooker-Feldman doctrine\n\n       For all of the foregoing reasons, the district court did\n\nnot err in dismissing the Silvas’ second federal action for\n\nlack of subject-matter jurisdiction under the Rooker-Feldman\n\ndoctrine.\n\n       3.     Preclusion principles provide an alternate reason\n              to affirm the district court’s decision to dismiss\n              the Silvas’ second federal action\n\n       Even    if   the   district     court    erred    in     dismissing     the\n\nSilvas’       second   federal    action      based     upon    Rooker-Feldman\n\nprinciples, which we do not conclude, dismissal was, in any\n\nevent, appropriate under preclusion principles.

Res judicata, or claim preclusion, bars the\n                   Silvas’ federal claims against Pellegrini\n\n      Res    judicata,             or     claim       preclusion,             “prevents      the\n\nrelitigation           of    all        claims        that     a     litigant        had     the\n\nopportunity and incentive to fully litigate in an earlier\n\naction.”     Giragosian, 547 F.3d at 63 (quotation, alterations\n\n                                              - 18 -\n\fomitted) (applying Massachusetts law).                       Under Massachusetts\n\nlaw, “[t]he operation of res judicata requires the presence\n\nof   three     elements:       (1)   the       identity      or    privity     of   the\n\nparties to the present and prior actions, (2) identity of\n\nthe cause of action, and (3) prior final judgment on the\n\nmerits.”        Andrews    Robinson,           547    F.3d    at     52   (quotation\n\nomitted).\n\n       Those    three    elements       are     present      here.        First,    the\n\nSilvas’ federal claims asserted against Pellegrini involve\n\nthe same parties as were involved in the state foreclosure\n\nproceeding.\n\n       Second, “Massachusetts deems causes of action identical\n\nfor claim preclusion purposes if they grow out of the same\n\ntransaction, act, or agreement, and seek redress for the\n\nsame    wrong.”          Id.     (quotation,           alterations         omitted).\n\n“Discrete      theories    of    liability           may   constitute      identical\n\ncauses of action for claim preclusion purposes if they are\n\nbased    upon    the    same    nucleus        of    operative       facts.”        Id.\n\n(applying       Massachusetts        law).          “Facts    forming      a   common\n\nnucleus are those meeting the following criteria: 1) whether\n\nthe facts are related in time, space, origin or motivation;\n\n2)   whether     the    facts    form      a   convenient         trial   unit;     and\n\n3) whether treating the facts as a unit conforms to the\n\nparties’ expectations.”              Herman v.

It is clear that the Silvas’\n\nfederal    claims    asserted      against     Pellegrini       in   the   second\n\nfederal action stem from the same nucleus of operative facts\n\nas   the     claims      at     issue     in     the        state    foreclosure\n\naction       —      P e l l e g r ini’s    use         of      Massachusetts’\n\nforeclosure-by-entry mechanism to take clear title to the\n\nhouse at 24 Clifford Lane.\n\n     Lastly, as previously discussed, the state foreclosure\n\naction is final.        And the state courts’ resolution of those\n\nproceedings      was    based      upon   the     merits       of    the   issues\n\npresented.\n\n           b.    Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, bars\n                 the Silvas’ federal claims asserted against\n                 the Commonwealth in the Silvas’ second federal\n                 action\n\n          The   Massachusetts    courts    use    several\n     formulations   interchangeably    to  describe   the\n     prerequisites for issue preclusion, but the Supreme\n     Judicial   Court   recently    stated   that   issue\n     preclusion applies when (1) there was a final\n     judgment on the merits in the prior adjudication;\n     (2) the party against whom preclusion is asserted\n     was a party (or in privity with a party) to the\n     prior adjudication; and (3) the issue in the prior\n     adjudication was identical to the issue in the\n     current adjudication. Additionally, [4] the issue\n     decided in the prior adjudication must have been\n     essential to the earlier judgment.     Massachusetts\n     courts also require that [5] appellate review must\n     have been available in the earlier case before\n     issue preclusion will arise.\n\n\n                                     - 20 -\n\fPisnoy v.

Second, clearly the parties against whom the\n\nCommonwealth          seeks       to       assert          the      prior        state\n\nadjudication — the Silvas — were parties to that prior state\n\nproceeding.\n\n       Third, “[i]ssue preclusion prevents relitigation of the\n\nsame issues actually litigated in [the] earlier judgment.”\n\nId. at 62.        “The question is whether there is anything in\n\nthe”    Silvas’      second      federal       action      “that    amounts      to   a\n\nsignificant change . . . from what was presented to the\n\nstate court.”        Id. (quotation omitted.) There was not.\n\n       Fourth, the relevant issues adjudicated in the state\n\nforeclosure proceeding — whether Pellegrini failed to give\n\nthe Silvas adequate notice of her foreclosure by entry, and\n\nwhether    Pellegrini’s           use     of     that      state         non-judicial\n\nforeclosure mechanism deprived the Silvas of their property\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 21 -\n\fwithout due process — was essential to the state courts’\n\ndecisions upholding Pellegrini’s foreclosure by entry.\n\n      Lastly, appellate review was available and pursued by\n\nthe Silvas in the state foreclosure proceeding.                        For these\n\nreasons,     Massachusetts’          collateral        estoppel        or     issue\n\npreclusion      principles     bar    the     Silvas      from    pursuing      the\n\nclaims they assert in their second federal action against\n\nthe Commonwealth.\n\n           c.      Conclusion as to preclusion\n\n      As   an     alternative    to     dismissal         on     the   basis     of\n\nRooker-Feldman, we conclude, for the foregoing reasons, that\n\ndismissal was appropriate based on preclusion principles.\n\nB.    Appeal No. 08-1956\n\n      Turning to appeal No. 08-1956, the Silvas challenge the\n\ndistrict    court’s       decision    to    deny    their      motion       seeking\n\nreconsideration, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5) and (6), of\n\nthe court’s earlier decision to dismiss their first federal\n\naction.\n\n      1.   Standard of review\n\n      This court generally will review the district court’s\n\ndecision denying the Silvas’ Rule 60(b) motion for an abuse\n\nof discretion.       See United States v. 6 Fox Street, 480 F.3d\n\n38,   46   (1st    Cir.    2007).       Where      “the    district         court’s\n\nexercise of discretion is premised on an erroneous legal\n\n\n                                     - 22 -\n\fprinciple,” however, “we review that legal error de novo.”\n\nUnited States v. Kayser-Roth Corp., 272 F.3d 89, 100 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).\n\n       2.    Rule 60(b)(5) and (6) relief\n\n       The district court dismissed the Silvas’ first federal\n\naction      based    upon   Younger      abstention,       in    light   of     the\n\nongoing       state     foreclosure        proceedings.               After     the\n\nMassachusetts        courts    entered    final       judgment   in    the    state\n\nlitigation,         quieting    title     in     24     Clifford      Street     in\n\nPellegrini, the Silvas sought to reopen the first federal\n\naction under Rule 60(b)(5) and (6).\n\n       In pertinent part, Rule 60(b) provides:\n\n       Grounds for Relief from a Final Judgment, Order, or\n       Proceeding.   On motion and just terms, the court\n       may relieve a party or its legal representative\n       from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the\n       following reasons:\n\n             . . . .\n\n       (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released or\n       discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that\n       has been reversed or vacated; or applying it\n       prospectively is no longer equitable; or\n\n       (6) any other reason that justifies relief.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).          “Although many courts have indicated\n\nthat Rule 60(b) motions should be granted liberally, [the\n\nFirst] Circuit has taken a harsher tack.                  Because Rule 60(b)\n\nis a vehicle for extraordinary relief, motions invoking the\n\nrule        should     be      granted         only      under     exceptional\n\n                                   - 23 -\n\fcircumstances.”              Davila-Alvarez            v.

Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P’ship,\n\n507 U.S. 380 (1993) (addressing “excusable neglect” under\n\nBankr. Rule 9006 and, by analogy, Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b))).\n\nRule     60(b)       “must      be    applied        so     as     to    recognize        the\n\ndesirability         of   deciding          disputes      on     their    merits,       while\n\nalso considering the importance of finality as applied to\n\ncourt judgments.”            Id. at 64 (quotation omitted).\n\n       Here, the Silvas have not shown that the district court\n\nabused    its    discretion           in    refusing        to    reopen    their       first\n\nfederal action.           The Silvas contend that the district court\n\nshould have granted them Rule 60(b) relief for this reason:\n\nAccording       to    the    Silvas,         the     district       court       originally\n\ndismissed        their       first          federal        action        under     Younger\n\nabstention       principles,           believing          that     the     Massachusetts\n\ncourts    would       provide         the    Silvas        with    a     full     and    fair\n\nopportunity          to   litigate         their     due     process       challenge       to\n\nPellegrini’s          foreclosure           by   entry.          The     Silvas    assert,\n\nhowever,     that         the        Massachusetts          Appeals        Court        never\n\naddressed their due process argument.                          Therefore, the Silvas\n\nclaim that the federal district court should have granted\n\n\n                                            - 24 -\n\fthem Rule 60(b) relief from the earlier dismissal of their\n\nfirst      federal    action,     reopened      that    federal        action   and\n\naddressed the merits of their federal claims.\n\n       We disagree with the Silvas that the state courts did\n\nnot address the Silvas’ due process argument.                     As previously\n\nexplained,      both     the     Massachusetts         Land     Court    and    the\n\nMassachusetts Appeals Court rejected the Silvas’ due-process\n\narguments.         In   light     of    that,   we     cannot     conclude      the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in refusing to reopen\n\nthe Silva’s first federal action. 8\n\nIII.         CONCLUSION\n\n       For   the     foregoing    reasons,      we     AFFIRM     the    district\n\ncourt’s      decision     to     deny    Rule    60(b)        relief    from    its\n\ndismissal of the Silvas’ first federal action, as well as\n\nthe district court’s decision to dismiss the Silvas’ second\n\nfederal action.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n     In light of our conclusion that the district court did\nnot abuse its discretion in denying the Silvas Rule 60(b)\nrelief, we need not address Appellees’ other arguments.\n\n                                       - 25 -\n\f",

Having\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we AFFIRM.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n       The Silvas and Defendant-Appellee Ruth Pellegrini are\n\nsiblings.       Their mother died in either 1975 or 1976.                        At the\n\ntime of their mother’s death, Pellegrini and her children\n\nwere    living      with    her   mother    in      the     family        home   at     24\n\nClifford Street, Readville, Massachusetts.                         However, in her\n\nwill, the mother left the Readville home to the Silvas.\n\nThe Silvas, nonetheless, initially agreed that Pellegrini\n\ncould continue to live in the home.                       She did so, paying the\n\nhouse taxes and utilities but no rent.\n\n       In   1976,     the   Silvas    obtained        a    $25,000    loan       from    a\n\nbank, securing that debt with a mortgage on the house at 24\n\nClifford       Street.      The   bank   recorded          the    mortgage       in   the\n\nSuffolk County Registry of Deeds.\n\n       In   1981,     the   Silvas     tried        unsuccessfully          to    evict\n\nPellegrini.         Because she refused to vacate the house, the\n\nSilvas      stopped    making     payments       on       the    mortgage.        As     a\n\nresult, the bank started foreclosure proceedings in February\n\n\n                                       - 2 -\n\f1981.     In order “[t]o avoid losing her home, Ms. Pellegrini\n\npurchased the note” from the bank in May 1981.                 Pellegrini\n\nrecorded     the   bank’s   transfer   of   its   note   to   her   in   the\n\nSuffolk County Registry of Deeds.           The Silvas never made any\n\nmortgage payments to Pellegrini.\n\nA.   Pellegrini’s foreclosure and state action to quiet title\n\n     In 2000, Pellegrini sought to foreclose on the mortgage\n\nshe had purchased from the bank almost twenty years earlier.\n\nPellegrini did so using a non-judicial foreclosure mechanism\n\nprovided for under Massachusetts law — foreclosure by entry.\n\nSee Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 244, §§ 1-2. 1             In compliance with\n\n     1\n         Massachusetts General Laws ch. 244, § 1 provides that\n\n     [a] mortgagee may, after breach of condition of a\n     mortgage of land, recover possession of the land\n     mortgaged by an open and peaceable entry thereon,\n     if not opposed by the mortgagor or other person\n     claiming it, or by action under this chapter; and\n     possession so obtained, if continued peaceably for\n     three years from the date of recording of the\n     memorandum or certificate as provided in section\n     two,   shall  forever   foreclose  the   right  of\n     redemption.\n\nMassachusetts General Laws ch. 244, § 2 further provides:\n\n     If an entry for breach of condition is made without\n     a judgment, a memorandum of the entry shall be made\n     on the mortgage deed and signed by the mortgagor or\n     person claiming under him, or a certificate, under\n     oath, of two competent witnesses to prove the entry\n     shall be made.     Such memorandum or certificate\n     shall after the entry, except as provided in\n     section   seventy  of   chapter  one   hundred  and\n     eighty-five, be recorded in the registry of deeds\n                                              (continued...)\n\n                                 - 3 -\n\fthe Massachusetts foreclosure-by-entry statute, Pellegrini\n\n“entered” the home at 24 Clifford Street, observed by two\n\nwitnesses, and then recorded with the county registry of\n\ndeeds a notice of the foreclosure and a certificate from the\n\ntwo witnesses attesting that the foreclosure by entry had\n\noccurred.        After the expiration of the three-year redemption\n\nperiod that followed the foreclosure, see Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch.       244,   §   1,   Pellegrini     filed   an   action   in   the\n\nMassachusetts Land Court, on September 22, 2003, seeking to\n\nremove any cloud on her title to 24 Clifford Street. 2              The\n\n\n      1\n       (...continued)\n      for the county or district where the land lies,\n      with a note of reference, if the mortgage is\n      recorded in the same registry, from each record to\n      the other.  Unless such record is made, the entry\n      shall not be effectual for the purposes mentioned\n      in the preceding section.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n      2\n     Although Pellegrini had complied with all of the\nstate-law requirements for effecting a foreclosure by entry,\nshe failed to comply with the Massachusetts procedures\nimplementing the federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, 50\nU.S.C. App. §§ 501-96 (Supp. 2009). See generally Beaton v.\nLand Court, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 304 (Mass. 1975) (discussing\nMassachusetts statutes implementing the federal Relief Act).\nAmong other things, the federal relief act protects military\npersonnel from foreclosure on their property while they are\non active duty.    See 50 U.S.C. § 533(c) (as revised in\n2003).   Because there is no indication that either of the\nSilvas fell under the protection provided by this federal\nstatute, however, Pellegrini’s failure to comply with the\nMassachusetts procedures implementing the federal relief act\nhad no effect on the validity of the foreclosure.        See\nBeaton, 326 N.E.2d at 305 (noting that, “[i]f a foreclosure\n                                             (continued...)\n\n                                 - 4 -\n\fSilvas defended, arguing among other things that they were\n\nbeing denied their property without due process.                    The Land\n\nCourt rejected that argument, concluding that the statutory\n\nrequirements      for     conducting    a     foreclosure    by   entry   were\n\nsufficient to satisfy due process and that Pellegrini had\n\ncomplied with those statutory requirements.                 The Land Court,\n\ntherefore, entered judgment for Pellegrini, declaring that\n\nshe held title to 24 Clifford Street “free and clear of the\n\n[Silvas’] claims.”\n\n     The Silvas filed a motion seeking reconsideration, which\n\nthe Land Court denied.         But the Land Court apparently failed\n\nto notify the parties of its decision, and the Silvas did\n\nnot discover the denial until four months later, after the\n\ntime to file an appeal had expired.\n\nB.   Silvas’ first federal action\n\n     Because it appeared that the Silvas would be unable to\n\npursue    a    timely     appeal   in   the    state-court    action,     they\n\ninstead       filed   a   complaint     in    federal   court,    naming    as\n\nDefendants Pellegrini, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\n\n\n\n     2\n     (...continued)\nwere otherwise properly made, failure to comply with the\n[Servicemembers Civil] Relief Act would not render the\nforeclosure invalid as to anyone not entitled to the\nprotection of that act”). But there would remain a cloud on\nPellegrini’s title until she filed suit to establish that\nneither Silva was entitled to relief under the federal\nstatute. See id.\n\n                                    - 5 -\n\fand   the    Justices     of   the   Massachusetts         Land      Court.       Soon\n\nthereafter, the Massachusetts Appeals Court agreed to hear\n\nthe Silvas’ untimely appeal from the Land Court decision.\n\nIn light of that, the federal district court dismissed the\n\nSilvas’ federal action, based upon the Younger abstention\n\ndoctrine. 3\n\nC.    State appeal of the Land Court’s decision\n\n      Before      the    Massachusetts       Appeals      Court,       the    Silvas\n\nargued again, among other things, that they had been denied\n\ntheir property without due process.                     That state appellate\n\ncourt upheld the Land Court’s decision, concluding that the\n\nSilvas      had    received      notice     of    the    foreclosure         through\n\nPellegrini’s        compliance       with        the    requirements         of    the\n\nMassachusetts foreclosure-by-entry statute.

Because it is clear in this case that the Silvas\n\nwere the unsuccessful parties in the state-court foreclosure\n\naction, we focus on the remaining three factors set forth in\n\nLance.\n\n            a.         Whether the Silvas’ second federal action\n                      “complain[s] of injuries caused by state-court\n                      judgments”\n\n    It     is    clear    that    the     Silvas’   second   federal     action\n\ncomplains       of    injuries    caused    by   the   state-court     judgment\n\nentered in the Massachusetts foreclosure action.                        In the\n\ncomplaint        in    their     second    federal     action,   the     Silvas\n\nalleged:\n\n    Pellegrini used a state statute (MGL c. 244) in\n    such a way as not to require actual notice of\n    proceedings depriving them of their title to their\n    property . . .\n\n            . . . .\n\n    28. The Silvas raised the federal constitutional\n    due process issue under the Fifth And Fourteenth\n    Amendments at every level of the Massachusetts\n    state courts, but such courts chose not to address\n    the constitutional questions.\n\n    29. There is a real and actual controversy between\n    the parties in that defendant Pellegrini takes the\n    position that the state statute (c. 244) provides\n    for and allows the deprivation of real property\n    without actual and personal notification to the\n    record title holders, and the Silvas contend that\n    any such state law would be unconstitutional on its\n    face and/or as applied to the Silvas or their real\n    property under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\n    to the United States Constitution.\n\n    30.  Moreover, defendant Pellegrini is taking the\n    position that since she followed MGL c. 244, and\n\n                                     - 10 -\n\f       even though the Silvas did not receive actual or\n       personal notification of what she was doing, that\n       under the state statute the Silvas have lost all\n       right, title and interest in their Readville house.\n\n       These alleged injuries stem directly from the judgment\n\nentered in the state foreclosure action upholding the rights\n\nof Ms. Pellegrini to take this very action.

The\n\nFirst Circuit has further concluded that, for Rooker-Feldman\n\npurposes, “when the highest state court in which review is\n\navailable has affirmed the judgment below and nothing is\n\nleft to be resolved, then without a doubt the state court\n\nproceedings have ‘ended.’” 7      Id., at 24.\n\n    In    this   case,   the   state   foreclosure    proceeding     had\n\ncertainly “ended” by the time the state’s highest court, the\n\nMassachusetts     Supreme   Judicial     Court,    denied   the   Silvas\n\nfurther review on January 31, 2008.               See Pellegrini, 880\n\nN.E.2d at 413 (Table).         The Silvas initiated their second\n\nfederal action two months later, on March 25, 2008.                Thus,\n\nthe state-court proceedings had ended, for Rooker-Feldman\n\npurposes, before the Silvas commenced their second federal\n\naction.\n\n          c.      Whether the Silvas’ second federal action\n                 “invit[ed] district court review and rejection\n                 of [the state-court] judgments”\n\n    The Silvas asserted two claims in their second federal\n\naction: 1) seeking a declaration that any state law that\n\n\n    7\n     The First Circuit has also recognized two other\ncircumstances,   not  relevant  here,  when   a  state-court\nproceeding will have “ended” for Rooker-Feldman purposes:\n1) “if the state action has reached a point where neither\nparty seeks further action”; and 2) “if the state court\nproceedings have finally resolved all the federal questions\nin the litigation, but state law or purely factual questions\n(whether   great   or  small)  remain   to  be   litigated.”\nFederacion de Maestros, 410 F.3d at 24-25.\n\n                                - 12 -\n\f“allows    the     deprivation       of    property      without   actual       and\n\npersonal        notice    to   the    record     title     holders      of     real\n\nestate . . . is defective and unconstitutional under the\n\nFifth     and     Fourteenth       Amendments     to     the   United        States\n\nConstitution”; and 2) alleging that Mass.

Enter a temporary restraining order enjoining\n       the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, its courts,\n       counties, towns and any other public officer from\n       in any way enforcing, carrying out or acting upon\n       MGL c. 244 generally or as it is applied to the\n       Silvas and their property.\n\n       2.

Enter a temporary restraining order enjoining\n       defendant Pellegrini from alienating or encumbering\n       the Silvas’ house at 24 Clifford Street, Readville\n       pending resolution of this action.\n\n       4.  After hearing, enter a preliminary injunction\n       consistent with prayer 3 above.\n\n       5.

Award the Silvas their damages for any\n       unconstitutional application of MGL c. 244 to their\n       real estate in Readville, Massachusetts.\n\n\n                                      - 13 -\n\f       7.   Award the Silvas their costs and legal fees\n       under 42 USC sec. 1988.\n\n       8. Such other relief as the Court deems just and\n       appropriate.\n\n       In order for the district court to grant the Silvas\n\nthis relief that they requested, the district court would\n\nhave “to declare that the state court wrongly decided [the\n\nSilvas’] claim” in the state foreclosure action.                        Davison,\n\n471    F.3d    at     223.       And    “[t]he    Rooker-Feldman        doctrine\n\nprevents [the district court] from doing this.”                        Id.     This\n\nbar applies notwithstanding that the Silvas are asserting in\n\ntheir federal action a federal constitutional claim pursuant\n\nto 42 U.S.C. § 1983.             See Diva’s Inc. v.

It may be true that, “if the\n\nplaintiff alleges a constitutional violation by an adverse\n\nparty independent of the injury caused by the state court\n\njudgment,       the       [Rooker-Feldman]        doctrine      does    not     bar\n\n\n                                        - 14 -\n\fjurisdiction.”            Davison, 471 F.3d at 222 (emphasis added).\n\nBut here, the Silvas themselves alleged in their federal\n\ncomplaint that they “raised the federal constitutional due\n\nprocess issue under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments at\n\nevery level of the Massachusetts state courts.”                         Thus, the\n\nSilvas’ federal claim challenging the constitutionality of\n\nthe     Massachusetts         foreclosure-by-entry            statute     is     not\n\n“independent         of    the       injury   caused    by   the    state      court\n\njudgment.”      Davison, 471 F.3d at 222.\n\n       The Silvas counter that the state courts never addressed\n\nthe merits of their due process argument.

Full and authoritative notice to all persons would\n\nsatisfy due process notice requirements and, accordingly,\n\nthe Massachusetts Appeals Court apparently felt it was not\n\nnecessary in this case to address whether or not the due\n\nprocess      clause     was     even     applicable           because      of     the\n\npossibility that a foreclosure by entry and recorded notice\n\nmight    not    involve     state   action:        “this    case       presents    no\n\n‘occasion to determine whether the due process clause even\n\nhas      any      applicability          to        nonjudicial            mortgage\n\nforeclosures.’”        Id. at *3 (quoting Beaton, 326 N.E.2d at\n\n307 n.6).      Thus, the Massachusetts courts expressly rejected\n\nthe Silvas’ due process claim.\n\n      Moreover, even if we were to assume the truth of the\n\nSilvas’ allegation that, although they “raised the federal\n\nconstitutional        due     process    issue        under      the    Fifth     and\n\nFourteenth Amendments at every level of the Massachusetts\n\nstate courts,” the state “courts chose not to address the\n\nconstitutional        questions,”       we    would      still    conclude      that\n\nRooker-Feldman bars the Silvas’ second federal action. This\n\ncourt could not grant the Silvas the relief they request\n\nwithout concluding that the Massachusetts state courts erred\n\nin    the      decisions      entered        in    the     state       foreclosure\n\nproceedings.          Cf.   Davison,         471   F.3d    at     223    (applying\n\nRooker-Feldman doctrine after rejecting federal plaintiffs’\n\n\n                                    - 16 -\n\fargument that they never got their “day in [state] court”\n\nbecause of state court’s procedural ruling).                     The ruling of\n\nthe    Massachusetts       Appeals     Court     expressly       rejected      the\n\nSilvas’ due process claim and no federal relief could be\n\ngranted without challenging that state court holding.\n\n              d. Conclusion as to the application of the\n                 Rooker-Feldman doctrine\n\n       For all of the foregoing reasons, the district court did\n\nnot err in dismissing the Silvas’ second federal action for\n\nlack of subject-matter jurisdiction under the Rooker-Feldman\n\ndoctrine.\n\n       3.     Preclusion principles provide an alternate reason\n              to affirm the district court’s decision to dismiss\n              the Silvas’ second federal action\n\n       Even    if   the   district     court    erred    in     dismissing     the\n\nSilvas’       second   federal    action      based     upon    Rooker-Feldman\n\nprinciples, which we do not conclude, dismissal was, in any\n\nevent, appropriate under preclusion principles.

Therefore, the Silvas\n\nclaim that the federal district court should have granted\n\n\n                                            - 24 -\n\fthem Rule 60(b) relief from the earlier dismissal of their\n\nfirst      federal    action,     reopened      that    federal        action   and\n\naddressed the merits of their federal claims.\n\n       We disagree with the Silvas that the state courts did\n\nnot address the Silvas’ due process argument.                     As previously\n\nexplained,      both     the     Massachusetts         Land     Court    and    the\n\nMassachusetts Appeals Court rejected the Silvas’ due-process\n\narguments.         In   light     of    that,   we     cannot     conclude      the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in refusing to reopen\n\nthe Silva’s first federal action. 8\n\nIII.         CONCLUSION\n\n       For   the     foregoing    reasons,      we     AFFIRM     the    district\n\ncourt’s      decision     to     deny    Rule    60(b)        relief    from    its\n\ndismissal of the Silvas’ first federal action, as well as\n\nthe district court’s decision to dismiss the Silvas’ second\n\nfederal action.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n     In light of our conclusion that the district court did\nnot abuse its discretion in denying the Silvas Rule 60(b)\nrelief, we need not address Appellees’ other arguments.\n\n                                       - 25 -\n\f</pre>",
