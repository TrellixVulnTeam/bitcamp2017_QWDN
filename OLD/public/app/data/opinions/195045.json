Vavlitis, was convicted of bank fraud, 18 U.S.C.  \n\n1344(1),  for  kiting  checks  and  withdrawing   money  from\n\naccounts bearing insufficient  funds.  We consider  on appeal\n\nwhether the district  court erred by dismissing  midtrial the\n\nsuperseding  indictment   on  which  Vavlitis  had  not  been\n\narraigned, and  by  allowing the  trial  to continue  on  the\n\noriginal indictment.  We also must determine whether the jury\n\ninstruction on reasonable  doubt was  erroneous, and  whether\n\nthere  was sufficient proof of fraudulent intent.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \n\n                          BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \n\n          In January 1990, Vavlitis maintained seven checking\n\naccounts, including six commercial  accounts and one personal\n\naccount, at two  federally-insured banks,  Atlantic Bank  and\n\nTrust Company (Atlantic Bank) and  Bank of New England.  Four\n\nof the accounts were with  Atlantic Bank; Bank of New England\n\nheld  the remainder.  Vavlitis was an authorized signatory on\n\neach  of these  accounts.   Atlantic Bank's  practice at  all\n\nrelevant times was  to credit Vavlitis's accounts  with funds\n\nequal to the face value of the checks he deposited, without a\n\ndelay to  verify that  these checks would  be honored  by the\n\nbanks  on which  they were  drawn.   This practice  created a\n\n\"float,\" a period of one or more days  that would pass before\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\n\na deposited check  credited to an account would  be processed\n\nand  presented for  payment  from the  account  of the  check\n\nwriter--Vavlitis. \n\n          From January  1990 until  May 1990  when the  banks\n\nfroze his  accounts, Vavlitis used  the float to buoy  up the\n\nbalances  in his  accounts  by  exchanging  checks  drawn  on\n\ninsufficient  funds between  Atlantic Bank  and  Bank of  New\n\nEngland.  He withdrew money and wrote checks to third parties\n\nagainst funds he did not actually  have, despite his inflated\n\nbalances.   The result was  that when his four  Atlantic Bank\n\naccounts  were frozen  on May  14,  1990, there  was a  total\n\noverdraft  of $1,615,968.92.    When  Bank  of  New  England,\n\nsuspecting check  kiting, closed Vavlitis's three accounts in\n\nMay   1990,  there  was   a  combined  positive   balance  of\n\n$683,292.63.\n\n          On  February 19,  1991, a  grand  jury returned  an\n\nindictment  charging Vavlitis with  one count of  bank fraud.\n\nThe indictment  alleged that  between January  and May  1990,\n\nVavlitis orchestrated  a check  kiting  scheme by  depositing\n\nchecks written  on insufficient  funds into  the accounts  he\n\ncontrolled at  Atlantic Bank  and Bank of  New England.   The\n\ncharging  paragraph  of   the  indictment,  paragraph  seven,\n\nalleged  that  this   scheme  allowed   Vavlitis  to   obtain\n\n\"$1,615,968.00, more or  less, owned by and under the custody\n\nand  control  of  Atlantic  Bank and  Bank  of  New England.\"\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\n\nParagraph nine alleged  that as a result of  the check kiting\n\nscheme,  \"Atlantic Bank suffered a loss of $1,615,968.00 more\n\nor less, minus $638,315.00 in funds recouped from the Bank of\r                                                                         \n\nNew England checking accounts maintained by defendant STELIOS\r                                                                         \n\nM. VAVLITIS, for a net  ultimate loss of $932,653.00, more or\r                                                                         \n\nless.\"   (Emphasis added.)   Vavlitis  was arraigned on  this\r                \n\nindictment on March 5, 1991.\n\n          On  March 12,  1991,  the  grand  jury  returned  a\n\nsuperseding  indictment,  identical in  all  respects  to the\n\noriginal  indictment, except for  paragraph nine.   Paragraph\n\nnine of the superseding indictment stated that as a result of\n\nthe check kiting  scheme, \"Atlantic Bank  suffered a loss  of\n\n$1,615,968.00 more or less.\"  The superseding indictment thus\n\nalleged the total loss resulting from the scheme, but did not\n\ndescribe the \"net ultimate loss.\"  Because of an oversight by\n\nthe  prosecutor,  Vavlitis   was  never   arraigned  on   the\n\nsuperseding indictment.  \n\n          In  her opening  statement  in Vavlitis's  trial on\n\nNovember  30, 1992, the prosecutor referred to the indictment\n\nand  stated  that Vavlitis  \"left  the  banks with  the  $1.6\n\nmillion  loss.\"    She  did  not  use  the  term \"superseding\n\nindictment.\"  Defense  counsel moved for a  mistrial claiming\n\nthat he  had no notice  of the  superseding indictment,1  and\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  On September 6,  1991, more than  one year before  trial,\nthe   government  served  defense   counsel  with  its  trial\nmemorandum,  which stated:    \"Vavlitis  is  charged  in  the\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\n\nthat his  client had  not been arraigned  on it.   The  trial\n\ncourt denied the motion, pending further inquiry, and allowed\n\nthe prosecution to call four witnesses from the two banks.  \n\n          After the first day of  trial, the court found that\n\nVavlitis  had   not  been   arraigned   on  the   superseding\n\nindictment.   The court  granted the prosecution's  motion to\n\ndismiss the superseding  indictment and allowed the  trial to\n\ncontinue  on  the  original indictment.    Defense  counsel's\n\nrenewed motion  for mistrial  and motion  for dismissal  were\n\ndenied.   The trial  court subsequently denied  a motion  for\n\njudgment of acquittal, and the  jury found Vavlitis guilty of\n\nbank fraud.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\nA.

We disagree.\n\n          It is  clear  that the  grand  jury's return  of  a\n\nsuperseding indictment does not void the original indictment.\n\nSee United  States v.  Friedman, 649 F.2d  199, 202  (3d Cir.\r                                           \n\n1981); United States  v.

A  defendant may use the\r                        \n\nDouble Jeopardy Clause to prevent  reprosecution following an\n\nacquittal  or conviction on a superseding indictment, but may\n\nnot   rely  on  the  notion  that  a  superseding  indictment\n\ninstantaneously  nullifies  the  original  indictment.    See\r                                                                         \n\nUnited States  v. Bowen, 946  F.2d 734, 736 (10th  Cir. 1991)\r                                   \n\n(finding  \"no  authority  which  supports   .  .  .  that   a\n\nsuperseding  indictment zaps an earlier indictment to the end\n\nthat the earlier indictment somehow vanishes into thin air\").\n\nBoth  indictments in  this  case  remained  valid  until  the\n\ndistrict court granted the government's motion to dismiss the\n\nsuperseding indictment.\n\n          Vavlitis also contends  that the midtrial dismissal\n\nof the  superseding indictment prevented  further prosecution\n\nfor the same offense charged in the original indictment.  The\n\naspect of the Double Jeopardy  Clause at issue in  Vavlitis's\n\nassertion is the protection against reprosecution following a\n\nfavorable   termination   of  proceedings   midtrial.     The\n\n\"historical\" underpinning of  the double jeopardy prohibition\n\nis that \n\n          \"the  State  with all  its  resources and\n          power  should  not  be  allowed  to  make\n          repeated   attempts    to   convict    an\n          individual   for   an   alleged  offense,\n          thereby subjecting him  to embarrassment,\n          expense and ordeal  and compelling him to\n          live in a continuing state of anxiety and\n          insecurity,  as  well  as  enhancing  the\n          possibility that even  though innocent he\n          may be found guilty.\"  \n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\n\nUnited States v.

One purpose\r                            \n\nof the  prohibition  on reprosecution  following  a  midtrial\n\nruling  that ends the case is to protect the \"valued right of\n\na  defendant to  have  his  [or her]  trial  completed\" by  a\n\nparticular tribunal.

First, Vavlitis fails\n\nto show  a second attachment of jeopardy.   Jeopardy attached\n\nwhen the jury was impanelled  for the bank fraud prosecution.\n\nSee Crist v.  Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 37-38 (1978).  There was no\r                               \n\nimpanelment of a  second jury and no second  verdict, thus no\n\nrelinquishment  of the valued right to a particular tribunal,\n\nno enhancement of the risk  of an erroneous verdict, and none\n\nof the expense or the ordeal of a subsequent prosecution.\n\n          Even if we  assume that the further  prosecution of\n\nVavlitis on the original  indictment following the  dismissal\n\nof the  superseding indictment constituted a  reattachment of\n\njeopardy, we would not find a double jeopardy violation.  The\n\ndistrict court  dismissed the superseding  indictment without\n\nresolving   any  factual  issue  in  favor  of  the  accused.\n\nAlthough  the trial could  have proceeded on  the superseding\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\n\nindictment,  see United States  v.

We note  that if  the trial  court had\n\ndismissed the  case,  as Vavlitis  requested, the  government\n\ncould  have  appealed  such a  ruling  without  violating the\n\nDouble  Jeopardy  Clause.    See  Scott,  437  U.S.  at 98-99\r                                                   \n\n(holding that defendant who obtained dismissal of proceedings\n\non grounds unrelated to factual guilt or innocence suffers no\n\ninjury under  Double Jeopardy Clause if  government appeals).\n\nA  fortiori, the continuation  of the prosecution  before the\r                       \n\nsame   fact-finder  did  not   violate  the  double  jeopardy\n\nprohibition.\n\n          Vavlitis's  next argument  is that  the indictments\n\ncontained  materially   different  allegations,  so   that  a\n\nvariance of proof  and an improper  amendment of the  charges\n\nresulted  from  the  midtrial  substitution,  and  that  this\n\nunfairly  prejudiced the  defense.    We  note  that  defense\n\ncounsel failed  to  specifically raise  these  issues  below.\n\nAssuming these issues were preserved, we find no error.\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\n\n          In  the first place, there was no material variance\n\nof proof.  A  variance occurs when the proof differs from the\n\nallegations in the  indictment.  United  States v.

A  variance is material and\n\nreversible  only   if  it   has   affected  the   defendant's\n\n\"'substantial  rights'\":  to be  informed of the charges; and\n\nto prevent a second prosecution for the same offense.

The  evidence  showed a  pattern  of\n\ndeposits  and withdrawals between  Vavlitis's accounts in the\n\ntwo  banks, so  that on the  day his accounts  were frozen, a\n\ntotal overdraft of $1,615,968.92 existed in his Atlantic Bank\n\naccounts, while  Bank of  New England  registered a  positive\n\nbalance  of  $683,292.63.    The  proof  comported  with  the\n\ncharges.\n\n          Vavlitis's   argument   that   the   charges   were\n\nimproperly amended is  also unavailing.

See United\r                                                                         \n\nStates v.  Kelly, 722  F.2d 873, 876  (1st Cir.  1983), cert.\r                                                                         \n\ndenied, 465 U.S.  1070 (1984).   Although  the trial  court's\r                  \n\nsubstitution  of an indictment alleging a \"net ultimate loss\"\n\nfor an indictment alleging the  total loss suffered by one of\n\nthe banks literally  altered one of  the allegations, it  did\n\nnot  constitute an  amendment of  the  grand jury's  charges.\n\nBoth  indictments  accurately  reflected  the  grand   jury's\n\ncharges.   There is  ample evidence  to support the  district\n\ncourt's  finding that  Vavlitis was  \"well  informed\" of  the\n\ncharges  in the  indictment  on which  he  was arraigned  and\n\nultimately convicted.  \n\n          Furthermore, the record does not support Vavlitis's\n\nargument that the midtrial  exchange of indictments  unfairly\n\nprejudiced his  defense.  Vavlitis had been  arraigned on the\n\nindictment on which  he was convicted and  had an opportunity\n\nto prepare a defense based on it.  Only paragraph nine of the\n\nsuperseding indictment differed from the original indictment,\n\nand  only insofar  as  the  superseding  indictment  did  not\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\n\ndescribe the \"net  ultimate loss\" resulting from  the scheme.\n\nOn the only day of  the trial when the superseding indictment\n\nwas  effective, defense counsel said in his opening statement\n\nthat the  banks had recouped  money.  He  also cross-examined\n\nwitnesses to  elicit that Bank  of New England  actually held\n\nfunds in Vavlitis's accounts in May 1990.  At  no time during\n\nthe  trial did the  jury hear  that a  superseding indictment\n\nexisted.   The prosecutor's  opening statement  that Vavlitis\n\n\"left  the banks  with the  $1.6  million loss\"  was just  as\n\nconsistent  with the evidence and with the charging paragraph\n\nof the  original indictment, as  it was with  the superseding\n\nindictment.   \n\n          There is thus no  support for Vavlitis's  arguments\n\nclaiming  a double jeopardy  violation, a variance  of proof,\n\nand a prejudicial amendment of the charges.  We hold that the\n\ndistrict  court did  not err  in  dismissing the  superseding\n\nindictment in this case, and in allowing the trial to proceed\n\non  the  original  indictment,  following  defense  counsel's\n\nobjection that  his  client had  not  been arraigned  on  the\n\nsuperseding indictment.\n\nB.  Reasonable Doubt Instruction\r            B.  Reasonable Doubt Instruction\r                                            \n\n          Vavlitis's next  argument is  that the  trial court\n\nprovided an  erroneous jury  instruction defining  reasonable\n\ndoubt.  The jury instruction on reasonable doubt stated: \n\n               It   is   not  required   that   the\n          government   prove   guilt   beyond   all\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\n\n          possible  doubt,  the   test  is  one  of\n          reasonable doubt.  A  reasonable doubt is\n          a doubt  based  upon  reason  and  common\n          sense.     It  does  not  mean  that  the\n          government has an obligation to prove the\n          charge in  this count  to an  absolute or\n          mathematical certainty.   Proof  beyond a\n          reasonable doubt does  not mean proof  to\n          the  degree of  certainty  that you  have\n          that the sun will rise tomorrow or if you\n          add  five and five you  will get ten.  It\r                                                               \n          does not mean the doubt  in the mind of a\r                                                               \n          juror  who  is  looking for  a  doubt  or\r                                                               \n          looking   for   an  excuse   to   acquit,\r                                                              \n          reasonable doubt  means the doubt  in the\n          mind of a reasonable juror who is seeking\n          the truth.  It is a doubt based on reason\n          and common sense.\n               The test is, are you satisfied that,\n          acting as reasonable persons and applying\n          your  reasoning  to the  evidence  before\n          you, you arrive at  a conclusion that the\n          offense as charged has  been committed by\n          the defendant,  and are you  so satisfied\n          of  that   fact  as  to  leave  no  other\n          reasonable      conclusion      possible.\n          Reasonable doubt may  arise because there\n          is simply not  enough evidence or because\n          you do  not accept the evidence  that was\n          offered.   It may be that the evidence is\n          susceptible     to     one     of     two\n          interpretations, one favoring  guilt, one\n          favoring nonguilt.  If that is  the case,\n          the defendant is  entitled to the benefit\n          of  the  interpretation that  favors  not\n          guilty.   The jury  will remember  that a\n          defendant  is never  to  be convicted  on\n          mere suspicion or conjecture.  The burden\n          is always  upon the prosecution  to prove\n          guilt  beyond a  reasonable doubt.   This\n          burden never shifts  to a defendant,  for\n          the law never imposes upon a defendant in\n          a  criminal case  the burden  or duty  of\n          calling  any witnesses  or producing  any\n          evidence.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\n\n          Vavlitis avers that the instruction that reasonable\n\ndoubt is not \"the doubt in the mind of a juror who is looking\n\nfor  a doubt or  looking for  an excuse  to acquit\"  may have\n\nreduced  the  government's  burden of  proof.    According to\n\nVavlitis's brief, the instruction \"almost urges the jurors to\n\nlook askance at any juror\" viewing the government's case with\n\nskepticism, and  it  may have  enabled some  jurors to  \"brow\n\nbeat\" any others who were inclined to acquit.  \n\n          Vavlitis did not make a specific objection at trial\n\nto   this  aspect  of   the  reasonable   doubt  instruction.\n\nConsequently, we review the instruction only for plain error.\n\nSee United  States v.  Colon-Pagan, 1 F.3d  80, 81  (1st Cir.\r                                              \n\n1993); United States v.

We find no such error.  \n\n          Considering the propriety  of a single  instruction\n\non  appeal, we  evaluate the  challenged  instruction in  the\n\ncontext  of  the  overall  charge.    See  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \n\nDeVincent, 632 F.2d  147, 152 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied,  449\r                                                                   \n\nU.S.  986  (1980).   We  keep  in  mind that  \"[t]hat  which,\n\nstanding  alone, may fall short of perfection may nonetheless\n\nbe tolerable  in the  context  of a  charge which  adequately\n\ninstructs the jury on the standard it is to apply.\"  Id.  \r                                                                    \n\n          Although cluttered  with unnecessary  language, the\n\nreasonable doubt instruction in this case  neither undermined\n\nthe  government's burden of proof, nor caused jurors inclined\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\n\nto   acquit  to  be   \"brow  beat[en].\"     The  trial  court\n\nspecifically  instructed  the  jurors  \"to consult  with  one\n\nanother  and  to  deliberate  with  a  view  to  reaching  an\n\nagreement,  if you  can do  so  without violating  individual\n\njudgment,\" but never to surrender an \"honest conviction . . .\n\nsolely  because  of  the  opinion  of  your  fellow  jurors.\"\n\nInstead, the  challenged instruction  addresses the  state of\n\nmind  of the  jurors.   It  exhorts the  jurors  to view  the\n\nevidence rationally, not  to look  for an  excuse to  acquit,\n\nbecause  such a mindset would not produce a reasonable doubt,\n\nbut to view the  evidence with the intent to seek  the truth.\n\n\"Instructions which thus urge that the jury's decision should\n\nbe the product  of a rational thought  process, while perhaps\n\n'unwisely  emphatic,' have  been upheld  in the  overwhelming\n\nmajority   of  cases.

Vavlitis set up the commercial accounts\n\ndescribed  in the  indictment  ostensibly to  serve  separate\n\nbusiness interests; presumably, transactions between accounts\n\nshould not have been frequent.  In a two  month period within\n\nthe time frame alleged in the indictment, March through April\n\n1990, Vavlitis  deposited over  450 checks  from  one of  the\n\nseven  accounts  into another  of the  seven accounts.   This\n\nmeans  that on  average, Vavlitis  deposited  ten checks  per\n\nbanking  day,  drawn from  one  of  the seven  accounts  into\n\nanother  of  these  accounts, resulting  in  the  movement of\n\napproximately $69 million.  According  to a witness from Bank\n\nof  New  England,  two  of  these  accounts  related to  land\n\nholdings for  which  one  would expect  to  see  very  little\n\naccount activity.   Because  Vavlitis wrote  checks to  third\n\nparties while he was making deposits, the deficit between the\n\namount  of funds  he actually  had  and the  amount of  funds\n\ncredited upon each deposit increased each day.  Day after day\n\nin this  two month period,  there were insufficient  funds in\n\nthese   accounts  to   cover  the   checks  Vavlitis   wrote,\n\nnotwithstanding  the  existence  of  any  other  accounts  or\n\nsecured  loans Vavlitis  may have  maintained  at the  banks.\n\nVirtually all deposits (99.8%) into these seven accounts were\n\nfrom one of the other  seven accounts, rather than from third\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\n\nparty  sources.   A  reasonable  juror  could  infer that  no\n\nlegitimate business practice accounted for this pattern.  \n\n          An expert witness, FBI Special Agent Daniel Dubree,\n\ndescribed a  prototypical check  kiting scheme  to the  jury,\n\nanalyzed the activity in the seven accounts, and  opined that\n\nVavlitis's  frenetic  deposits  and  withdrawals  constituted\n\ncheck  kiting.   He explained  that the  Bank of  New England\n\naccounts  served as intermediary  accounts to create  a float\n\nperiod for checks circulating in and out of the Atlantic Bank\n\naccounts.    For   this  reason,  the  check   kiting  scheme\n\npersisted,  even though Bank of New England, suspecting check\n\nkiting, notified Vavlitis in late January 1990 that it  would\n\nno  longer honor  checks written  against  uncollected funds;\n\nAtlantic Bank  continued to credit  his accounts on  the date\n\nchecks were deposited  until the accounts were frozen and the\n\noverdrafts  exceeded  $1.6 million.    Dubree  testified that\n\nVavlitis's transactions followed a pattern of  transfers from\n\none  account  into  another  specified  account,  that   this\n\nappeared to  be no accident, and  that it would have  made it\n\neasier for Vavlitis to track how much he needed to deposit to\n\ncover checks he had already written.  \n\n          We  acknowledge that  \"[t]he  mere  existence of  a\n\ncheck kiting scheme does  not as a  matter of law imply\"  the\n\nspecific  intent  necessary  for  a  bank  fraud  conviction.\n\nRodriguez-Alvarado,  952  F.2d  at  589.    But   considering\r                              \n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\n\nVavlitis's business  experience, the notice he  received from\n\nBank of New England,  the size of the Atlantic Bank loss, the\n\nintricacy and sophistication  of the scheme, and  the absence\n\nof  a legitimate purpose  for the transactions,  a reasonable\n\njuror could conclude  that Vavlitis acted with  the requisite\n\nknowledge  and specific  intent to  use the  float  period to\n\ninflate his  account balances and  to defraud the banks.   We\n\nhold that the  trial court properly denied  Vavlitis's motion\n\nfor judgment of acquittal.    Therefore,           Vavlitis's\n\nconviction is,  \n\n          Affirmed.\r                      Affirmed.\r                               \n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\n",

Vavlitis, was convicted of bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344(1), for kiting checks and withdrawing money from accounts bearing insufficient funds.  We consider on appeal whether the district court erred by dismissing midtrial the superseding indictment on which Vavlitis had not been arraigned, and by allowing the trial to continue on the original indictment.  We also must determine whether the jury instruction on reasonable doubt was erroneous, and whether there was sufficient proof of fraudulent intent.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1990, Vavlitis maintained seven checking accounts, including six commercial accounts and one personal account, at two federally-insured banks, Atlantic Bank and Trust Company (Atlantic Bank) and Bank of New England.  Four of the accounts were with Atlantic Bank;  Bank of New England held the remainder.  Vavlitis was an authorized signatory on each of these accounts.  Atlantic Bank's practice at all relevant times was to credit Vavlitis's accounts with funds equal to the face value of the checks he deposited, without a delay to verify that these checks would be honored by the banks on which they were drawn.  This practice created a \"float,\" a period of one or more days that would pass before a deposited check credited to an account would be processed and presented for payment from the account of the check writer--Vavlitis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From January 1990 until May 1990 when the banks froze his accounts, Vavlitis used the float to buoy up the balances in his accounts by exchanging checks drawn on insufficient funds between Atlantic Bank and Bank of New England.  He withdrew money and wrote checks to third parties against funds he did not actually have, despite his inflated balances.  The result was that when his four Atlantic Bank accounts were frozen on May 14, 1990, there was a total overdraft of $1,615,968.92.  When Bank of New England, suspecting check kiting, closed Vavlitis's three accounts in May 1990, there was a combined positive balance of $683,292.63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 19, 1991, a grand jury returned an indictment charging Vavlitis with one count of bank fraud.  The indictment alleged that between January and May 1990, Vavlitis orchestrated a check kiting scheme by depositing checks written on insufficient funds into the accounts he controlled at Atlantic Bank and Bank of New England.  The charging paragraph of the indictment, paragraph seven, alleged that this scheme allowed Vavlitis to obtain \"$1,615,968.00, more or less, owned by and under the custody and control of Atlantic Bank and Bank of New England.\"   Paragraph nine alleged that as a result of the check kiting scheme, \"Atlantic Bank suffered a loss of $1,615,968.00 more or less, minus $638,315.00 in funds recouped from the Bank of New England checking accounts maintained by defendant STELIOS M. VAVLITIS, for a net ultimate loss of $932,653.00, more or less.\"  (Emphasis added.)   Vavlitis was arraigned on this indictment on March 5, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 12, 1991, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment, identical in all respects to the original indictment, except for paragraph nine.  Paragraph nine of the superseding indictment stated that as a result of the check kiting scheme, \"Atlantic Bank suffered a loss of $1,615,968.00 more or less.\"   The superseding indictment thus alleged the total loss resulting from the scheme, but did not describe the \"net ultimate loss.\"   Because of an oversight by the prosecutor, Vavlitis was never arraigned on the superseding indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her opening statement in Vavlitis's trial on November 30, 1992, the prosecutor referred to the indictment and stated that Vavlitis \"left the banks with the $1.6 million loss.\"   She did not use the term \"superseding indictment.\"   Defense counsel moved for a mistrial claiming that he had no notice of the superseding indictment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and that his client had not been arraigned on it.  The trial court denied the motion, pending further inquiry, and allowed the prosecution to call four witnesses from the two banks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the first day of trial, the court found that Vavlitis had not been arraigned on the superseding indictment.  The court granted the prosecution's motion to dismiss the superseding indictment and allowed the trial to continue on the original indictment.  Defense counsel's renewed motion for mistrial and motion for dismissal were denied.  The trial court subsequently denied a motion for judgment of acquittal, and the jury found Vavlitis guilty of bank fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>A. Dismissal of Indictment, Double Jeopardy, Variance, and Constructive Amendment</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vavlitis argues that the midtrial dismissal of the superseding indictment prevented any further prosecution on the original indictment, and that the continuation of the trial on the original indictment violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that the grand jury's return of a superseding indictment does not void the original indictment.  See United States v. Friedman, 649 F.2d 199, 202 (3d Cir.1981);  United States v. Holm, 550 F.2d 568, 569 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 856, 98 S.Ct. 176, 54 L.Ed.2d 127 (1977).  A defendant may use the Double Jeopardy Clause to prevent reprosecution following an acquittal or conviction on a superseding indictment, but may not rely on the notion that a superseding indictment instantaneously nullifies the original indictment.  See United States v. Bowen, 946 F.2d 734, 736 (10th Cir.1991) (finding \"no authority which supports ... that a superseding indictment zaps an earlier indictment to the end that the earlier indictment somehow vanishes into thin air\").  Both indictments in this case remained valid until the district court granted the government's motion to dismiss the superseding indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vavlitis also contends that the midtrial dismissal of the superseding indictment prevented further prosecution for the same offense charged in the original indictment.  The aspect of the Double Jeopardy Clause at issue in Vavlitis's assertion is the protection against reprosecution following a favorable termination of proceedings midtrial.  The \"historical\" underpinning of the double jeopardy prohibition is that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>\"the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82, 87, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 2192, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978) (quoting Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 187-88, 78 S.Ct. 221, 223, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957)).  One purpose of the prohibition on reprosecution following a midtrial ruling that ends the case is to protect the \"valued right of a defendant to have his [or her] trial completed\" by a particular tribunal.  Id., 437 U.S. at 92, 98 S.Ct. at 2194;  United States v. Govro, 833 F.2d 135, 137 (9th Cir.1987);  United States ex rel. Young v. Lane, 768 F.2d 834, 838 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 951, 106 S.Ct. 317, 88 L.Ed.2d 300 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these principles, we find no merit in Vavlitis's double jeopardy argument.  First, Vavlitis fails to show a second attachment of jeopardy.  Jeopardy attached when the jury was impanelled for the bank fraud prosecution.  See Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 37-38, 98 S.Ct. 2156, 2161-62, 57 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978).  There was no impanelment of a second jury and no second verdict, thus no relinquishment of the valued right to a particular tribunal, no enhancement of the risk of an erroneous verdict, and none of the expense or the ordeal of a subsequent prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assume that the further prosecution of Vavlitis on the original indictment following the dismissal of the superseding indictment constituted a reattachment of jeopardy, we would not find a double jeopardy violation.  The district court dismissed the superseding indictment without resolving any factual issue in favor of the accused.  Although the trial could have proceeded on the superseding indictment, see United States v. Boruff, 909 F.2d 111, 118 (5th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 975, 111 S.Ct. 1620, 113 L.Ed.2d 718 (1991);  see also Garland v. Washington, 232 U.S. 642, 644-46, 34 S.Ct. 456, 456-57, 58 L.Ed. 772 (1914) (affirming conviction despite lack of arraignment because accused, who had notice of charges and adequate opportunity to prepare defense, was not deprived of any substantial right), the court dismissed the superseding indictment so that Vavlitis would be tried on the indictment on which he had been arraigned.  We note that if the trial court had dismissed the case, as Vavlitis requested, the government could have appealed such a ruling without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause.  See Scott, 437 U.S. at 98-99, 98 S.Ct. at 2197-98 (holding that defendant who obtained dismissal of proceedings on grounds unrelated to factual guilt or innocence suffers no injury under Double Jeopardy Clause if government appeals).  A fortiori, the continuation of the prosecution before the same fact-finder did not violate the double jeopardy prohibition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vavlitis's next argument is that the indictments contained materially different allegations, so that a variance of proof and an improper amendment of the charges resulted from the midtrial substitution, and that this unfairly prejudiced the defense.  We note that defense counsel failed to specifically raise these issues below.  Assuming these issues were preserved, we find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, there was no material variance of proof.  A variance occurs when the proof differs from the allegations in the indictment.  United States v. Fisher, 3 F.3d 456, 462 (1st Cir.1993).  A variance is material and reversible only if it has affected the defendant's \" 'substantial rights' \":  to be informed of the charges;  and to prevent a second prosecution for the same offense.  Id. at 463 (quoting United States v. Tormos-Vega, 959 F.2d 1103, 1115 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 191-92, 121 L.Ed.2d 135 (1992)).  The charging paragraphs of the superseding and original indictments in this case alleged that the check kiting scheme enabled Vavlitis to obtain \"$1,615,968.00 more or less, owned by and under the custody and control of Atlantic Bank and Bank of New England.\"   The original indictment, on which Vavlitis was arraigned and convicted, alleged a \"net ultimate loss\" of $932,653.00.  The evidence showed a pattern of deposits and withdrawals between Vavlitis's accounts in the two banks, so that on the day his accounts were frozen, a total overdraft of $1,615,968.92 existed in his Atlantic Bank accounts, while Bank of New England registered a positive balance of $683,292.63.  The proof comported with the charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vavlitis's argument that the charges were improperly amended is also unavailing.  An amendment occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are altered after the grand jury has last passed upon them.  United States v. Dunn, 758 F.2d 30, 35 (1st Cir.1985).  Midtrial amendments are deemed prejudicial per se for the following reasons:  to preserve the right of the person accused of an infamous crime to have a grand jury vote on an indictment, to prevent reprosecution for the same offense, and to protect the right of the accused to be informed of the charges.  See United States v. Kelly, 722 F.2d 873, 876 (1st Cir.1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1070, 104 S.Ct. 1425, 79 L.Ed.2d 749 (1984).  Although the trial court's substitution of an indictment alleging a \"net ultimate loss\" for an indictment alleging the total loss suffered by one of the banks literally altered one of the allegations, it did not constitute an amendment of the grand jury's charges.  Both indictments accurately reflected the grand jury's charges.  There is ample evidence to support the district court's finding that Vavlitis was \"well informed\" of the charges in the indictment on which he was arraigned and ultimately convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the record does not support Vavlitis's argument that the midtrial exchange of indictments unfairly prejudiced his defense.  Vavlitis had been arraigned on the indictment on which he was convicted and had an opportunity to prepare a defense based on it.  Only paragraph nine of the superseding indictment differed from the original indictment, and only insofar as the superseding indictment did not describe the \"net ultimate loss\" resulting from the scheme.  On the only day of the trial when the superseding indictment was effective, defense counsel said in his opening statement that the banks had recouped money.  He also cross-examined witnesses to elicit that Bank of New England actually held funds in Vavlitis's accounts in May 1990.  At no time during the trial did the jury hear that a superseding indictment existed.  The prosecutor's opening statement that Vavlitis \"left the banks with the $1.6 million loss\" was just as consistent with the evidence and with the charging paragraph of the original indictment, as it was with the superseding indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is thus no support for Vavlitis's arguments claiming a double jeopardy violation, a variance of proof, and a prejudicial amendment of the charges.  We hold that the district court did not err in dismissing the superseding indictment in this case, and in allowing the trial to proceed on the original indictment, following defense counsel's objection that his client had not been arraigned on the superseding indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Reasonable Doubt Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vavlitis's next argument is that the trial court provided an erroneous jury instruction defining reasonable doubt.  The jury instruction on reasonable doubt stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not required that the government prove guilt beyond all possible doubt, the test is one of reasonable doubt.  A reasonable doubt is a doubt based upon reason and common sense.  It does not mean that the government has an obligation to prove the charge in this count to an absolute or mathematical certainty.  Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof to the degree of certainty that you have that the sun will rise tomorrow or if you add five and five you will get ten.  It does not mean the doubt in the mind of a juror who is looking for a doubt or looking for an excuse to acquit, reasonable doubt means the doubt in the mind of a reasonable juror who is seeking the truth.  It is a doubt based on reason and common sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The test is, are you satisfied that, acting as reasonable persons and applying your reasoning to the evidence before you, you arrive at a conclusion that the offense as charged has been committed by the defendant, and are you so satisfied of that fact as to leave no other reasonable conclusion possible.  Reasonable doubt may arise because there is simply not enough evidence or because you do not accept the evidence that was offered.  It may be that the evidence is susceptible to one of two interpretations, one favoring guilt, one favoring nonguilt.  If that is the case, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of the interpretation that favors not guilty.  The jury will remember that a defendant is never to be convicted on mere suspicion or conjecture.  The burden is always upon the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  This burden never shifts to a defendant, for the law never imposes upon a defendant in a criminal case the burden or duty of calling any witnesses or producing any evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vavlitis avers that the instruction that reasonable doubt is not \"the doubt in the mind of a juror who is looking for a doubt or looking for an excuse to acquit\" may have reduced the government's burden of proof.  According to Vavlitis's brief, the instruction \"almost urges the jurors to look askance at any juror\" viewing the government's case with skepticism, and it may have enabled some jurors to \"brow beat\" any others who were inclined to acquit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vavlitis did not make a specific objection at trial to this aspect of the reasonable doubt instruction.  Consequently, we review the instruction only for plain error.  See United States v. Colon-Pagan, 1 F.3d 80, 81 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Campbell, 874 F.2d 838, 841 (1st Cir.1989).  We find no such error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering the propriety of a single instruction on appeal, we evaluate the challenged instruction in the context of the overall charge.  See United States v. DeVincent, 632 F.2d 147, 152 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 986, 101 S.Ct. 405, 66 L.Ed.2d 249 (1980).  We keep in mind that \"[t]hat which, standing alone, may fall short of perfection may nonetheless be tolerable in the context of a charge which adequately instructs the jury on the standard it is to apply.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although cluttered with unnecessary language, the reasonable doubt instruction in this case neither undermined the government's burden of proof, nor caused jurors inclined to acquit to be \"brow beat[en].\"  The trial court specifically instructed the jurors \"to consult with one another and to deliberate with a view to reaching an agreement, if you can do so without violating individual judgment,\" but never to surrender an \"honest conviction ... solely because of the opinion of your fellow jurors.\"   Instead, the challenged instruction addresses the state of mind of the jurors.  It exhorts the jurors to view the evidence rationally, not to look for an excuse to acquit, because such a mindset would not produce a reasonable doubt, but to view the evidence with the intent to seek the truth.  \"Instructions which thus urge that the jury's decision should be the product of a rational thought process, while perhaps 'unwisely emphatic,' have been upheld in the overwhelming majority of cases.  We cannot say that the present formulation constitutes reversible error.\"  Id. at 153 (citations omitted);  see also Watkins v. Ponte, 987 F.2d 27, 32 (1st Cir.1993) (upholding a similar jury instruction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vavlitis also argues on appeal an issue that he raised at trial, that the reasonable doubt charge is flawed because it did not define reasonable doubt as that which would cause a juror to \"hesitate to act on the most important of affairs.\"  \"This Court has emphasized that reasonable doubt does not require a specific definition.\"  United States v.

The evidence that Vavlitis was a business person who had borrowed more than a million dollars from the banks indicates that he was generally knowledgeable about financial matters and banking.  Vavlitis set up the commercial accounts described in the indictment ostensibly to serve separate business interests;  presumably, transactions between accounts should not have been frequent.  In a two month period within the time frame alleged in the indictment, March through April 1990, Vavlitis deposited over 450 checks from one of the seven accounts into another of the seven accounts.  This means that on average, Vavlitis deposited ten checks per banking day, drawn from one of the seven accounts into another of these accounts, resulting in the movement of approximately $69 million.  According to a witness from Bank of New England, two of these accounts related to land holdings for which one would expect to see very little account activity.  Because Vavlitis wrote checks to third parties while he was making deposits, the deficit between the amount of funds he actually had and the amount of funds credited upon each deposit increased each day.  Day after day in this two month period, there were insufficient funds in these accounts to cover the checks Vavlitis wrote, notwithstanding the existence of any other accounts or secured loans Vavlitis may have maintained at the banks.  Virtually all deposits (99.8%) into these seven accounts were from one of the other seven accounts, rather than from third party sources.  A reasonable juror could infer that no legitimate business practice accounted for this pattern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An expert witness, FBI Special Agent Daniel Dubree, described a prototypical check kiting scheme to the jury, analyzed the activity in the seven accounts, and opined that Vavlitis's frenetic deposits and withdrawals constituted check kiting.  He explained that the Bank of New England accounts served as intermediary accounts to create a float period for checks circulating in and out of the Atlantic Bank accounts.  For this reason, the check kiting scheme persisted, even though Bank of New England, suspecting check kiting, notified Vavlitis in late January 1990 that it would no longer honor checks written against uncollected funds;  Atlantic Bank continued to credit his accounts on the date checks were deposited until the accounts were frozen and the overdrafts exceeded $1.6 million.  Dubree testified that Vavlitis's transactions followed a pattern of transfers from one account into another specified account, that this appeared to be no accident, and that it would have made it easier for Vavlitis to track how much he needed to deposit to cover checks he had already written.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that \"[t]he mere existence of a check kiting scheme does not as a matter of law imply\" the specific intent necessary for a bank fraud conviction.  Rodriguez-Alvarado, 952 F.2d at 589.   But considering Vavlitis's business experience, the notice he received from Bank of New England, the size of the Atlantic Bank loss, the intricacy and sophistication of the scheme, and the absence of a legitimate purpose for the transactions, a reasonable juror could conclude that Vavlitis acted with the requisite knowledge and specific intent to use the float period to inflate his account balances and to defraud the banks.  We hold that the trial court properly denied Vavlitis's motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, Vavlitis's conviction is,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On September 6, 1991, more than one year before trial, the government served defense counsel with its trial memorandum, which stated:  \"Vavlitis is charged in the Superseding Indictment with one count of bank fraud....\"  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Vavlitis, was convicted of bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344(1), for kiting checks and withdrawing money from accounts bearing insufficient funds.  We consider on appeal whether the district court erred by dismissing midtrial the superseding indictment on which Vavlitis had not been arraigned, and by allowing the trial to continue on the original indictment.  We also must determine whether the jury instruction on reasonable doubt was erroneous, and whether there was sufficient proof of fraudulent intent.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1990, Vavlitis maintained seven checking accounts, including six commercial accounts and one personal account, at two federally-insured banks, Atlantic Bank and Trust Company (Atlantic Bank) and Bank of New England.  Four of the accounts were with Atlantic Bank;  Bank of New England held the remainder.  Vavlitis was an authorized signatory on each of these accounts.  Atlantic Bank's practice at all relevant times was to credit Vavlitis's accounts with funds equal to the face value of the checks he deposited, without a delay to verify that these checks would be honored by the banks on which they were drawn.  This practice created a \"float,\" a period of one or more days that would pass before a deposited check credited to an account would be processed and presented for payment from the account of the check writer--Vavlitis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From January 1990 until May 1990 when the banks froze his accounts, Vavlitis used the float to buoy up the balances in his accounts by exchanging checks drawn on insufficient funds between Atlantic Bank and Bank of New England.  He withdrew money and wrote checks to third parties against funds he did not actually have, despite his inflated balances.  The result was that when his four Atlantic Bank accounts were frozen on May 14, 1990, there was a total overdraft of $1,615,968.92.  When Bank of New England, suspecting check kiting, closed Vavlitis's three accounts in May 1990, there was a combined positive balance of $683,292.63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 19, 1991, a grand jury returned an indictment charging Vavlitis with one count of bank fraud.  The indictment alleged that between January and May 1990, Vavlitis orchestrated a check kiting scheme by depositing checks written on insufficient funds into the accounts he controlled at Atlantic Bank and Bank of New England.  The charging paragraph of the indictment, paragraph seven, alleged that this scheme allowed Vavlitis to obtain \"$1,615,968.00, more or less, owned by and under the custody and control of Atlantic Bank and Bank of New England.\"   Paragraph nine alleged that as a result of the check kiting scheme, \"Atlantic Bank suffered a loss of $1,615,968.00 more or less, minus $638,315.00 in funds recouped from the Bank of New England checking accounts maintained by defendant STELIOS M. VAVLITIS, for a net ultimate loss of $932,653.00, more or less.\"  (Emphasis added.)   Vavlitis was arraigned on this indictment on March 5, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 12, 1991, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment, identical in all respects to the original indictment, except for paragraph nine.  Paragraph nine of the superseding indictment stated that as a result of the check kiting scheme, \"Atlantic Bank suffered a loss of $1,615,968.00 more or less.\"   The superseding indictment thus alleged the total loss resulting from the scheme, but did not describe the \"net ultimate loss.\"   Because of an oversight by the prosecutor, Vavlitis was never arraigned on the superseding indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her opening statement in Vavlitis's trial on November 30, 1992, the prosecutor referred to the indictment and stated that Vavlitis \"left the banks with the $1.6 million loss.\"   She did not use the term \"superseding indictment.\"   Defense counsel moved for a mistrial claiming that he had no notice of the superseding indictment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and that his client had not been arraigned on it.  The trial court denied the motion, pending further inquiry, and allowed the prosecution to call four witnesses from the two banks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the first day of trial, the court found that Vavlitis had not been arraigned on the superseding indictment.  The court granted the prosecution's motion to dismiss the superseding indictment and allowed the trial to continue on the original indictment.  Defense counsel's renewed motion for mistrial and motion for dismissal were denied.  The trial court subsequently denied a motion for judgment of acquittal, and the jury found Vavlitis guilty of bank fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>A.

A defendant may use the Double Jeopardy Clause to prevent reprosecution following an acquittal or conviction on a superseding indictment, but may not rely on the notion that a superseding indictment instantaneously nullifies the original indictment.  See United States v. Bowen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569383\"><a href=\"/opinion/569383/united-states-v-roy-l-bowen/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></a></span>, 736 (10th Cir.1991) (finding \"no authority which supports ... that a superseding indictment zaps an earlier indictment to the end that the earlier indictment somehow vanishes into thin air\").

The aspect of the Double Jeopardy Clause at issue in Vavlitis's assertion is the protection against reprosecution following a favorable termination of proceedings midtrial.

First, Vavlitis fails to show a second attachment of jeopardy.  Jeopardy attached when the jury was impanelled for the bank fraud prosecution.  See Crist v.

There was no impanelment of a second jury and no second verdict, thus no relinquishment of the valued right to a particular tribunal, no enhancement of the risk of an erroneous verdict, and none of the expense or the ordeal of a subsequent prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assume that the further prosecution of Vavlitis on the original indictment following the dismissal of the superseding indictment constituted a reattachment of jeopardy, we would not find a double jeopardy violation.  The district court dismissed the superseding indictment without resolving any factual issue in favor of the accused.  Although the trial could have proceeded on the superseding indictment, see United States v.

We note that if the trial court had dismissed the case, as Vavlitis requested, the government could have appealed such a ruling without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause.  See Scott, 437 U.S. at 98-99, 98 S.Ct. at 2197-98 (holding that defendant who obtained dismissal of proceedings on grounds unrelated to factual guilt or innocence suffers no injury under Double Jeopardy Clause if government appeals).

We note that defense counsel failed to specifically raise these issues below.  Assuming these issues were preserved, we find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, there was no material variance of proof.

The evidence showed a pattern of deposits and withdrawals between Vavlitis's accounts in the two banks, so that on the day his accounts were frozen, a total overdraft of $1,615,968.92 existed in his Atlantic Bank accounts, while Bank of New England registered a positive balance of $683,292.63.  The proof comported with the charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vavlitis's argument that the charges were improperly amended is also unavailing.  An amendment occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are altered after the grand jury has last passed upon them.  United States v. Dunn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"449678\"><a href=\"/opinion/449678/united-states-v-john-f-dunn-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.1985).  Midtrial amendments are deemed prejudicial per se for the following reasons:  to preserve the right of the person accused of an infamous crime to have a grand jury vote on an indictment, to prevent reprosecution for the same offense, and to protect the right of the accused to be informed of the charges.  See United States v. Kelly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"428305\"><a href=\"/opinion/428305/united-states-v-james-a-kelly-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></a></span>, 876 (1st Cir.1983), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></span> (1984).  Although the trial court's substitution of an indictment alleging a \"net ultimate loss\" for an indictment alleging the total loss suffered by one of the banks literally altered one of the allegations, it did not constitute an amendment of the grand jury's charges.  Both indictments accurately reflected the grand jury's charges.  There is ample evidence to support the district court's finding that Vavlitis was \"well informed\" of the charges in the indictment on which he was arraigned and ultimately convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the record does not support Vavlitis's argument that the midtrial exchange of indictments unfairly prejudiced his defense.  Vavlitis had been arraigned on the indictment on which he was convicted and had an opportunity to prepare a defense based on it.  Only paragraph nine of the superseding indictment differed from the original indictment, and only insofar as the superseding indictment did not describe the \"net ultimate loss\" resulting from the scheme.  On the only day of the trial when the superseding indictment was effective, defense counsel said in his opening statement that the banks had recouped money.  He also cross-examined witnesses to elicit that Bank of New England actually held funds in Vavlitis's accounts in May 1990.  At no time during the trial did the jury hear that a superseding indictment existed.  The prosecutor's opening statement that Vavlitis \"left the banks with the $1.6 million loss\" was just as consistent with the evidence and with the charging paragraph of the original indictment, as it was with the superseding indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is thus no support for Vavlitis's arguments claiming a double jeopardy violation, a variance of proof, and a prejudicial amendment of the charges.  We hold that the district court did not err in dismissing the superseding indictment in this case, and in allowing the trial to proceed on the original indictment, following defense counsel's objection that his client had not been arraigned on the superseding indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Reasonable Doubt Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vavlitis's next argument is that the trial court provided an erroneous jury instruction defining reasonable doubt.  The jury instruction on reasonable doubt stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not required that the government prove guilt beyond all possible doubt, the test is one of reasonable doubt.  A reasonable doubt is a doubt based upon reason and common sense.  It does not mean that the government has an obligation to prove the charge in this count to an absolute or mathematical certainty.  Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof to the degree of certainty that you have that the sun will rise tomorrow or if you add five and five you will get ten.  It does not mean the doubt in the mind of a juror who is looking for a doubt or looking for an excuse to acquit, reasonable doubt means the doubt in the mind of a reasonable juror who is seeking the truth.  It is a doubt based on reason and common sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The test is, are you satisfied that, acting as reasonable persons and applying your reasoning to the evidence before you, you arrive at a conclusion that the offense as charged has been committed by the defendant, and are you so satisfied of that fact as to leave no other reasonable conclusion possible.  Reasonable doubt may arise because there is simply not enough evidence or because you do not accept the evidence that was offered.  It may be that the evidence is susceptible to one of two interpretations, one favoring guilt, one favoring nonguilt.  If that is the case, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of the interpretation that favors not guilty.  The jury will remember that a defendant is never to be convicted on mere suspicion or conjecture.  The burden is always upon the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  This burden never shifts to a defendant, for the law never imposes upon a defendant in a criminal case the burden or duty of calling any witnesses or producing any evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vavlitis avers that the instruction that reasonable doubt is not \"the doubt in the mind of a juror who is looking for a doubt or looking for an excuse to acquit\" may have reduced the government's burden of proof.  According to Vavlitis's brief, the instruction \"almost urges the jurors to look askance at any juror\" viewing the government's case with skepticism, and it may have enabled some jurors to \"brow beat\" any others who were inclined to acquit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vavlitis did not make a specific objection at trial to this aspect of the reasonable doubt instruction.  Consequently, we review the instruction only for plain error.  See United States v. Colon-Pagan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194878\"><a href=\"/opinion/194878/united-states-v-colon-pagan/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 81 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v.

We find no such error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering the propriety of a single instruction on appeal, we evaluate the challenged instruction in the context of the overall charge.  See United States v. DeVincent, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"382752\"><a href=\"/opinion/382752/united-states-v-richard-devincent/\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span>, 152 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It exhorts the jurors to view the evidence rationally, not to look for an excuse to acquit, because such a mindset would not produce a reasonable doubt, but to view the evidence with the intent to seek the truth.  \"Instructions which thus urge that the jury's decision should be the product of a rational thought process, while perhaps 'unwisely emphatic,' have been upheld in the overwhelming majority of cases.  We cannot say that the present formulation constitutes reversible error.\"  Id. at 153 (citations omitted);  see also Watkins v.

O'Brien, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588169\"><a href=\"/opinion/588169/united-states-v-marshall-p-obrien/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1992).  In fact, we have criticized the use of \"hesitate to act\" instructions, and we have held that the failure to include such an instruction is not reversible error.  See id. at 15-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we recognize that we must \"tolerate a reasonable range of expression\" unless we impose pattern jury instructions, Watkins, 987 F.2d at 32 (quotation omitted), we hold that the trial court's instruction defining reasonable doubt was not erroneous.  We note, however, that this instruction contains language that is unnecessary, could confuse the jury, and provides fertile grounds for objections.  Reasonable doubt is a fundamental concept that does not easily lend itself to refinement or definition.  See United States v.

The evidence that Vavlitis was a business person who had borrowed more than a million dollars from the banks indicates that he was generally knowledgeable about financial matters and banking.  Vavlitis set up the commercial accounts described in the indictment ostensibly to serve separate business interests;  presumably, transactions between accounts should not have been frequent.  In a two month period within the time frame alleged in the indictment, March through April 1990, Vavlitis deposited over 450 checks from one of the seven accounts into another of the seven accounts.  This means that on average, Vavlitis deposited ten checks per banking day, drawn from one of the seven accounts into another of these accounts, resulting in the movement of approximately $69 million.  According to a witness from Bank of New England, two of these accounts related to land holdings for which one would expect to see very little account activity.  Because Vavlitis wrote checks to third parties while he was making deposits, the deficit between the amount of funds he actually had and the amount of funds credited upon each deposit increased each day.  Day after day in this two month period, there were insufficient funds in these accounts to cover the checks Vavlitis wrote, notwithstanding the existence of any other accounts or secured loans Vavlitis may have maintained at the banks.  Virtually all deposits (99.8%) into these seven accounts were from one of the other seven accounts, rather than from third party sources.  A reasonable juror could infer that no legitimate business practice accounted for this pattern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An expert witness, FBI Special Agent Daniel Dubree, described a prototypical check kiting scheme to the jury, analyzed the activity in the seven accounts, and opined that Vavlitis's frenetic deposits and withdrawals constituted check kiting.  He explained that the Bank of New England accounts served as intermediary accounts to create a float period for checks circulating in and out of the Atlantic Bank accounts.  For this reason, the check kiting scheme persisted, even though Bank of New England, suspecting check kiting, notified Vavlitis in late January 1990 that it would no longer honor checks written against uncollected funds;  Atlantic Bank continued to credit his accounts on the date checks were deposited until the accounts were frozen and the overdrafts exceeded $1.6 million.  Dubree testified that Vavlitis's transactions followed a pattern of transfers from one account into another specified account, that this appeared to be no accident, and that it would have made it easier for Vavlitis to track how much he needed to deposit to cover checks he had already written.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that \"[t]he mere existence of a check kiting scheme does not as a matter of law imply\" the specific intent necessary for a bank fraud conviction.  Rodriguez-Alvarado, 952 F.2d at 589.   But considering Vavlitis's business experience, the notice he received from Bank of New England, the size of the Atlantic Bank loss, the intricacy and sophistication of the scheme, and the absence of a legitimate purpose for the transactions, a reasonable juror could conclude that Vavlitis acted with the requisite knowledge and specific intent to use the float period to inflate his account balances and to defraud the banks.  We hold that the trial court properly denied Vavlitis's motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, Vavlitis's conviction is,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On September 6, 1991, more than one year before trial, the government served defense counsel with its trial memorandum, which stated:  \"Vavlitis is charged in the Superseding Indictment with one count of bank fraud....\"  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
