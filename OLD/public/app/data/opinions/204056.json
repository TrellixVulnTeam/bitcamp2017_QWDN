Petitioner Jia Duan Dong, a\n\ncitizen of China, seeks review of a decision of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirming the denial of his application\n\nfor asylum.       Dong argues that the BIA erroneously failed to\n\nconsider whether he qualifies for asylum under section 601(a) of\n\nthe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n\n1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546, which extends\n\nrefugee status to certain individuals who have been or will be\n\nsubjected   to    coercive   population       control      procedures    such    as\n\ninvoluntary sterilization, or who have been or will be persecuted\n\nfor resisting a coercive population control program.\n\n            Concluding    that   the    BIA    did   not    err,   we    deny   the\n\npetition.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            Dong, a citizen of China, entered the United States\n\nwithout admission or parole at an unknown port of entry on the\n\nMexican border on March 10, 2004.                  Several months later, on\n\nDecember    10,   2004,   Dong   filed        an   application     for    asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the United Nations\n\nConvention Against Torture.       The Department of Homeland Security\n\ncommenced removal proceedings on February 3, 2005. On May 3, 2005,\n\nan immigration judge (\"IJ\") found Dong removable as an alien\n\npresent in the United States without admission or parole, a status\n\nhe conceded.      See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i).            A hearing on the\n\n                                       -2-\n\fmerits of Dong's asylum application then occurred before the same\n\nIJ on July 7, 2005.\n\n            According to petitioner's testimony, as well as other\n\nevidence before the IJ, Dong was born in 1963 in Fuzhou, the\n\ncapital city of China's Fujian Province. Dong was raised in Fuzhou\n\nand eventually took a job in a local paper factory.          On November\n\n28, 1990, Dong married Kangzhen Jiang in a traditional ceremony.\n\nThe marriage was registered with authorities on June 17, 1991, and,\n\non August 1, 1991, Kangzhen gave birth to their first child, a\n\ngirl.     Two   months   after   the   birth,   Chinese   family-planning\n\nauthorities required Kangzhen to submit to the insertion of an\n\nintrauterine device (\"IUD\").           Dong was not present when this\n\noccurred. Afterwards, Kangzhen was required to regularly report to\n\na local hospital for gynecological exams to ensure that the IUD\n\nremained in place.\n\n            During one such examination on May 10, 1993, nurses\n\ndiscovered that Kangzhen had become pregnant again, despite the\n\nIUD.    According to Dong, who was not present at the exam, Kangzhen\n\npleaded with family-planning authorities at the hospital to allow\n\nher to continue the pregnancy, but they forced her to abort it.\n\nNurses physically restrained Kangzhen by pinning her down, and the\n\nabortion procedure, which lasted about an hour, was painful.        Dong\n\ndescribed her as \"mentally unnormal\" after her return home.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f             After the abortion, authorities fitted Kangzhen with a\n\nnew IUD and again required her to submit to gynecological exams\n\nthree times a year.     In 1995, four years after the birth of their\n\nfirst child, Dong and Kangzhen applied for a \"birth permit\" to have\n\na second child. According to Dong, the authorities informed him at\n\nthat time that Chinese law would require that he or Kangzhen be\n\nsterilized after the second birth.            The permit was eventually\n\napproved; on June 9, 1996, Kangzhen gave birth to a boy.\n\n             Dong testified that shortly after the birth of his second\n\nchild, a group of officials came to his home to enforce the\n\nsterilization policy.     Although Dong was at work at the time, his\n\nwife later told him that the officials brought her to a local\n\nhospital and forced her to undergo a sterilization procedure.              By\n\nthe   time   Dong   learned   of   the   situation   and   traveled   to   the\n\nhospital, the procedure had already been completed.\n\n             Dong claims that he resolved to leave China after the\n\nsterilization, explaining that the incident was \"a permanent scar\n\nthat they put into our life, and it was a form of persecution.\"\n\nBecause he did not want to leave while the children were young,\n\nhowever, he waited four years before making his first attempt to\n\nleave China. After several unsuccessful attempts, he left China on\n\nJanuary 26, 2004, eight years after his wife's sterilization.\n\nKangzhen and the children remained in Fuzhou.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f               The IJ denied Dong's application, finding that Dong's\n\nassertion that he left China because of the sterilization was not\n\ncredible.       An appeal followed, and the BIA remanded the matter to\n\nthe IJ for further findings as to whether Dong's testimony about\n\nthe abortion and sterilization procedure was credible.                        The IJ\n\nissued a second order on May 10, 2007 in which he found that none\n\nof    Dong's    testimony     was    credible,       and   he   again   denied    the\n\napplication on that ground.              Dong appealed once more, and the BIA\n\naffirmed the IJ's decision on July 28, 2008.                The Board declined to\n\naddress the issue of Dong's credibility, finding instead that\n\nDong's testimony, even if true, did not establish his eligibility\n\nfor   asylum,        withholding    of    removal,    or   protection    under    the\n\nConvention Against Torture.              Dong then filed the present petition\n\nfor review, which is limited to the denial of asylum.\n\n                                           II.\n\n               The    Immigration    and    Nationality     Act   authorizes      the\n\nAttorney General, in his discretion, to grant asylum to an alien\n\nwho qualifies as a \"refugee\" within the meaning of the Act.                    See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A); INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481\n\n(1992); Touch v. Holder, 568 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir. 2009).                  The term\n\n\"refugee\" includes any person who is unable or unwilling to return\n\nto    his   country     of   nationality     \"because      of   persecution      or   a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fopinion.\"    8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42).   To be eligible for asylum, an\n\napplicant must therefore establish as a threshold matter that he\n\nhas suffered past persecution on account of one of the five\n\nprotected grounds, or that he has a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution on account of one of those grounds.        See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§§ 1208.13(a)-(b), 1208.14(a).\n\n            Dong claims that he was and will be persecuted \"on\n\naccount of . . . political opinion,\" relying on the broadened\n\ndefinition of that phrase set forth in section 601(a) of the\n\nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n\n1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546.       Section 601(a)\n\nprovides:\n\n            [A] person who has been forced to abort a\n            pregnancy    or   to    undergo    involuntary\n            sterilization, or who has been persecuted for\n            failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure\n            or for other resistance to a coercive\n            population control program, shall be deemed to\n            have been persecuted on account of political\n            opinion, and a person who has a well founded\n            fear that he or she will be forced to undergo\n            such a procedure or subject to persecution for\n            such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be\n            deemed to have a well founded fear of\n            persecution on account of political opinion.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42).    Congress enacted section 601(a) \"for the\n\nexpress purpose of overturning the BIA's decision in Matter of\n\nChang, 20 I. & N. Dec. 38 (B.I.A. 1989),\" which had held that\n\ninvoluntary sterilization pursuant to China's \"one child\" policy\n\ndid not constitute persecution on account of a protected ground.\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fLin-Zheng v. Att'y Gen., 557 F.3d 147, 151 (3d Cir. 2009) (en banc)\n\n(citing H.R. Rep. No. 104-469(I), at 173 (1996)).           As the 1996\n\namendment makes clear, an individual who has been (or will be)\n\nsubjected to coercive population control procedures is now \"deemed\"\n\nto have been persecuted on account of political opinion, as are\n\nindividuals who have been (or will be) persecuted for failing or\n\nrefusing to undergo such a procedure or for resisting a coercive\n\npopulation control program.\n\n          The    BIA   originally      interpreted   the     involuntary\n\nabortion/sterilization clause of section 601(a) to extend to both\n\nthe victims of those measures and their spouses.           See Matter of\n\nC-Y-Z-, 21 I. & N. Dec. 915, 918 (B.I.A. 1997) (en banc) (\"[T]he\n\nspouse of a woman who has been forced to undergo an abortion or\n\nsterilization procedure can thereby establish past persecution.\");\n\nsee also Matter of S-L-L-, 24 I. & N. Dec. 1, 4 (B.I.A. 2006) (en\n\nbanc) (reaffirming and clarifying the holding of Matter of C-Y-Z-);\n\nZeng v. Gonzales, 436 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 2006) (acknowledging\n\nthe BIA's interpretation).    Dong relied on that doctrine -- which\n\nwe shall refer to as the \"spousal bootstrapping rule\" -- throughout\n\nthe proceedings below, arguing before the IJ and the BIA that he\n\nwas eligible for asylum because of Kangzhen's forced abortion and\n\nsterilization.\n\n          The legal landscape shifted during the pendency of Dong's\n\nsecond appeal to the BIA, however.      Before the briefs were filed,\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthe Second Circuit held that the BIA's spousal bootstrapping rule\n\ncontravened the unambiguous text of section 601(a).2        See Lin v.\n\nU.S. Dep't of Justice, 494 F.3d 296, 300 (2d Cir. 2007) (en banc).\n\nThen, after Dong had submitted his brief to the BIA, the Attorney\n\nGeneral   issued   a   decision   expressly   abrogating   the   spousal\n\nbootstrapping rule.    See Matter of J-S-, 24 I. & N. Dec. 520, 536-\n\n37 (A.G. 2008) (\"[T]he spouse of the physical victim of [a coercive\n\npopulation control] procedure is not someone who can be considered\n\nper se to have faced, or to have a well-founded fear of facing,\n\n'persecution' 'on account of' 'resisting' a coercive population\n\ncontrol program . . . based solely on the fact that he or she is\n\nmarried to the victim.\") (emphasis in original). The BIA concluded\n\nthat Dong's asylum claim was foreclosed by the Attorney General's\n\ndecision and affirmed the IJ's denial of his application on that\n\nbasis.\n\n           Dong does not challenge the validity or applicability of\n\nthe Attorney General's decision in the present petition.         Instead,\n\nhe now claims that his own actions bring him within the \"other\n\nresistance\" clause of section 601(a).     See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)\n\n(providing that an individual who was persecuted, or has a well-\n\nfounded fear of being persecuted, for \"other resistance to a\n\n\n\n     2\n       Two other circuits reached the same conclusion in subsequent\ncases. See Yu v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 568 F.3d 1328, 1332-33 (11th\nCir. 2009) (per curiam); Lin-Zheng v. Att'y Gen., 557 F.3d 147, 149\n(3d Cir. 2009) (en banc).\n\n                                   -8-\n\fcoercive population control program\" shall be \"deemed to have a\n\nwell founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion\").\n\nTo be eligible for asylum under that provision, an applicant must\n\nshow that he engaged in resistance to a coercive population control\n\nprogram and that he was persecuted, or has a well-founded fear of\n\nbeing persecuted, for that resistance.    See Lin, 494 F.3d at 313;\n\nLi v. Ashcroft, 356 F.3d 1153, 1158-60 (9th Cir. 2004) (en banc).\n\nAccording to Dong, the BIA improperly refused to consider whether\n\nhis flight from China constituted \"resistance\" within the meaning\n\nof section 601(a).   He therefore asks us to do one of three things:\n\n(1) remand the matter to the BIA with instructions to determine\n\nwhether his flight renders him eligible for asylum; (2) rule as a\n\nmatter of law that his flight renders him eligible for asylum; or\n\n(3) instruct the BIA to remand the matter to the IJ for further\n\nfactfinding on the \"other resistance\" issue.3\n\n          Dong's first request is foreclosed by the procedural\n\nbackground of his case.      His argument suggests that the BIA\n\narbitrarily failed to consider a potentially outcome-determinative\n\nargument that was clearly before it.   Cf. Cordero-Trejo v. INS, 40\n\nF.3d 482, 492 (1st Cir. 1994) (remanding for further proceedings\n\nbecause, inter alia, the BIA failed to consider the applicant's\n\n\"pattern or practice\" persecution argument); Abdulai v. Ashcroft,\n\n\n     3\n       Dong's brief is not a model of clarity with respect to the\nrelief requested. For the sake of thoroughness, we consider all of\nthe possibilities suggested by his filings.\n\n                                -9-\n\f239 F.3d 542, 549 (3d Cir. 2001) (\"A decisionmaker must actually\n\nconsider   the   evidence    and    argument   that   a   party   presents.\")\n\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).            It is true that\n\nthe BIA did not consider whether Dong's flight amounted to \"other\n\nresistance.\"     However, Dong never presented that argument to the\n\nBIA in the first place.      As we have indicated, Dong relied almost\n\nexclusively    on   the   spousal    bootstrapping    rule   throughout   the\n\nadministrative proceedings.         He did not mention \"other resistance\"\n\nat all until his second appeal to the BIA.            Even then, he did not\n\nargue that he had resisted a coercive population control program by\n\nleaving China.      Rather, he asked for a remand so that he could\n\nattempt to muster unspecified evidence of resistance:\n\n           In the alternative, the case should be\n           remanded to allow the respondent to testify\n           more fully as to the events that occurred when\n           his wife was forcibly aborted and sterilized\n           to see if his actions may have constituted\n           \"other resistance\" as required by the recent\n           Second Circuit decision in Lin v. U.S.\n           Department of Justice.4\n\nPutting to one side the issue of whether the BIA erroneously denied\n\nDong's request for a remand for further factfinding, see infra, we\n\ncannot fault the Board for failing to consider an altogether\n\ndifferent merits argument that was never urged before it.             See Yu\n\n\n\n     4\n       Dong apparently meant to invoke the Lin court's observation\nthat the spouse of an individual who has been subjected to coercive\npopulation control measures, although not automatically eligible\nfor asylum, might nevertheless be eligible under section 601(a)'s\n\"other resistance\" provision. See Lin, 494 F.3d at 313.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fv. Gonzales, 502 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 2007) (rejecting the\n\napplicant's attempt to \"change the nature of [her forced abortion]\n\nclaim by shifting her focus in the appellate tribunals\" to her\n\nresistance efforts).\n\n          Dong's second request -- that we find as a matter of law\n\nthat his flight renders him eligible for asylum -- fails for\n\nsimilar reasons.   We have consistently held that \"arguments not\n\nraised before the BIA are waived due to a failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies.\"   See Molina De Massenet v. Gonzales, 485\n\nF.3d 661, 664 (1st Cir. 2007).     As we have explained, Dong never\n\nargued before the BIA that his flight from China constituted \"other\n\nresistance to a coercive population control program.\"      His attempt\n\nto raise that argument for the first time in this court is\n\ntherefore unavailing.   Id.; see also Olujoke v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d\n\n16, 22-23 (1st Cir. 2005) (rejecting an applicant's attempt to\n\n\"resurrect\" a claim in the court of appeals where the applicant\n\n\"failed to make any developed argumentation in support of that\n\nclaim before the BIA\").\n\n          Finally, to the extent that Dong means to challenge the\n\nBIA's refusal to remand for further factfinding, we review that\n\ndecision for abuse of discretion.       Pakasi v. Holder, 577 F.3d 44,\n\n48 (1st Cir. 2009). We may reverse under that deferential standard\n\nonly if the denial was \"made without a rational explanation,\n\ninexplicably departed from the established policies, or rested on\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fan   impermissible   basis.\"   Id.   (internal   quotation   marks   and\n\ncitations omitted).    None of those factors are present here.       Dong\n\ndid not explain to the BIA what additional facts he would have\n\npresented if the case had been remanded.   Nor did the record before\n\nthe BIA contain any obvious signs of resistance that could have\n\nbeen explored further.    Faced with a record and briefs that failed\n\nto show how further factfinding would aid Dong, the BIA properly\n\nexercised its discretion in declining to remand.     See id. (finding\n\nthat the BIA did not abuse its discretion in refusing to remand\n\nwhen the applicant failed to present any evidence that would have\n\naltered the outcome on remand).\n\n           The petition for review is DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f",

On May 3, 2005, an immigration judge (\"IJ\") found Dong removable as an alien present in the United States without admission or parole, a status he conceded. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). A hearing on the merits of Dong's asylum application then occurred before the same IJ on July 7, 2005.</p>\n<p>According to petitioner's testimony, as well as other evidence before the IJ, Dong was born in 1963 in Fuzhou, the capital city of China's Fujian Province. Dong was raised in Fuzhou and eventually took a job in a local paper factory. On November 28, 1990, Dong married Kangzhen Jiang in a traditional ceremony. The marriage was registered with authorities on June 17, 1991, and, on August 1, 1991, Kangzhen gave birth to their first child, a girl. Two months after the birth, Chinese family-planning authorities required Kangzhen to submit to the insertion of an intrauterine device (\"IUD\"). Dong was not present when this occurred. Afterwards, Kangzhen was required to regularly report to a local hospital for gynecological exams to ensure that the IUD remained in place.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> During one such examination on May 10, 1993, nurses discovered that Kangzhen had become pregnant again, despite the IUD. According to Dong, who was not present at the exam, Kangzhen pleaded with family-planning authorities at the hospital to allow her to continue the pregnancy, but they forced her to abort it. Nurses physically restrained Kangzhen by pinning her down, and the abortion procedure, which lasted about an hour, was painful. Dong described her as \"mentally unnormal\" after her return home.</p>\n<p>After the abortion, authorities fitted Kangzhen with a new IUD and again required her to submit to gynecological exams three times a year. In 1995, four years after the birth of their first child, Dong and Kangzhen applied for a \"birth permit\" to have a second child. According to Dong, the authorities informed him at that time that Chinese law would require that he or Kangzhen be sterilized after the second birth. The permit was eventually approved; on June 9, 1996, Kangzhen gave birth to a boy.</p>\n<p>Dong testified that shortly after the birth of his second child, a group of officials came to his home to enforce the sterilization policy. Although Dong was at work at the time, his wife later told him that the officials brought her to a local hospital and forced her to undergo a sterilization procedure. By the time Dong learned of the situation and traveled to the hospital, the procedure had already been completed.</p>\n<p>Dong claims that he resolved to leave China after the sterilization, explaining that the incident was \"a permanent scar that they put into our life, and it was a form of persecution.\" Because he did not want to leave while the children were young, however, he waited four years before making his first attempt to leave China. After several unsuccessful attempts, he left China on January 26, 2004, eight years after his wife's sterilization. Kangzhen and the children remained in Fuzhou.</p>\n<p>The IJ denied Dong's application, finding that Dong's assertion that he left China because of the sterilization was not credible. An appeal followed, and the BIA remanded the matter to the IJ for further findings as to whether Dong's testimony about the abortion and sterilization procedure was credible. The IJ issued a second order on May 10, 2007 in which he found that none of Dong's testimony was credible, and he again denied the application on that ground. Dong appealed once more, and the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision on July 28, 2008. The Board declined to address the issue of Dong's credibility, finding instead that Dong's testimony, even if true, did not establish his eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture. Dong then filed the present petition for review, which is limited to the denial of asylum.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes the Attorney General, in his discretion, to grant asylum to an alien who qualifies as a \"refugee\" within the meaning of the Act. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A); <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <i>Touch v. Holder,</i> 568 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir.2009). The term \"refugee\" includes any person who is unable or unwilling to return to his country of nationality \"because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42). To be eligible for asylum, an applicant must therefore establish as a threshold matter that he has suffered past persecution on account of one of the five <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> protected grounds, or that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of those grounds. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.13(a)-(b), 1208.14(a).</p>\n<p>Dong claims that he was and will be persecuted \"on account of ... political opinion,\" relying on the broadened definition of that phrase set forth in section 601(a) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546. Section 601(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>[A] person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion, and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p>8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42). Congress enacted section 601(a) \"for the express purpose of overturning the BIA's decision in <i>Matter of Chang,</i> 20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 38 (B.I.A.1989),\" which had held that involuntary sterilization pursuant to China's \"one child\" policy did not constitute persecution on account of a protected ground. <i>Lin-Zheng v. Att'y Gen.,</i> 557 F.3d 147, 151 (3d Cir.2009) (en banc) (citing H.R.Rep. No. 104-469(I), at 173 (1996)). As the 1996 amendment makes clear, an individual who has been (or will be) subjected to coercive population control procedures is now \"deemed\" to have been persecuted on account of political opinion, as are individuals who have been (or will be) persecuted for failing or refusing to undergo such a procedure or for resisting a coercive population control program.</p>\n<p>The BIA originally interpreted the involuntary abortion/sterilization clause of section 601(a) to extend to both the victims of those measures and their spouses. <i>See </i><i>Matter of C-Y-Z-,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 915, 918 (B.I.A.1997) (en banc) (\"[T]he spouse of a woman who has been forced to undergo an abortion or sterilization procedure can thereby establish past persecution.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Matter of S-L-L-,</i> 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1, 4 (B.I.A.2006) (en banc) (reaffirming and clarifying the holding of <i>Matter of C-Y-Z-</i>); <i>Zeng v. Gonzales,</i> 436 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir.2006) (acknowledging the BIA's interpretation). Dong relied on that doctrine  which we shall refer to as the \"spousal bootstrapping rule\"  throughout the proceedings below, arguing before the IJ and the BIA that he was eligible for asylum because of Kangzhen's forced abortion and sterilization.</p>\n<p>The legal landscape shifted during the pendency of Dong's second appeal to the BIA, however. Before the briefs were filed, the Second Circuit held that the BIA's spousal bootstrapping rule contravened the unambiguous text of section 601(a).<sup>[1]</sup><i>See </i><i>Lin v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,</i> 494 F.3d 296, 300 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). Then, after Dong had submitted his brief to the BIA, the Attorney General issued a decision expressly abrogating the spousal bootstrapping rule. <i>See </i><i>Matter of J-S-,</i> 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 520, 536-37 (A.G.2008) (\"[T]he spouse of the physical victim of [a coercive population control] procedure is <i>not</i> someone who can be considered per se to have faced, or to have a well-founded <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> fear of facing, `persecution' `on account of' `resisting' a coercive population control program ... based solely on the fact that he or she is married to the victim.\") (emphasis in original). The BIA concluded that Dong's asylum claim was foreclosed by the Attorney General's decision and affirmed the IJ's denial of his application on that basis.</p>\n<p>Dong does not challenge the validity or applicability of the Attorney General's decision in the present petition. Instead, he now claims that his own actions bring him within the \"other resistance\" clause of section 601(a). <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42) (providing that an individual who was persecuted, or has a well-founded fear of being persecuted, for \"other resistance to a coercive population control program\" shall be \"deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion\"). To be eligible for asylum under that provision, an applicant must show that he engaged in resistance to a coercive population control program and that he was persecuted, or has a well-founded fear of being persecuted, for that resistance. <i>See </i><i>Lin,</i> 494 F.3d at 313; <i>Li v. Ashcroft,</i> 356 F.3d 1153, 1158-60 (9th Cir.2004) (en banc). According to Dong, the BIA improperly refused to consider whether his flight from China constituted \"resistance\" within the meaning of section 601(a). He therefore asks us to do one of three things: (1)remand the matter to the BIA with instructions to determine whether his flight renders him eligible for asylum; (2)rule as a matter of law that his flight renders him eligible for asylum; or (3)instruct the BIA to remand the matter to the IJ for further factfinding on the \"other resistance\" issue.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Dong's first request is foreclosed by the procedural background of his case. His argument suggests that the BIA arbitrarily failed to consider a potentially outcome-determinative argument that was clearly before it. <i>Cf. </i><i>Cordero-Trejo v. INS,</i> 40 F.3d 482, 492 (1st Cir.1994) (remanding for further proceedings because, inter alia, the BIA failed to consider the applicant's \"pattern or practice\" persecution argument); <i>Abdulai v. Ashcroft,</i> 239 F.3d 542, 549 (3d Cir.2001) (\"A decisionmaker must actually consider the evidence and argument that a party presents.\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). It is true that the BIA did not consider whether Dong's flight amounted to \"other resistance.\" However, Dong never presented that argument to the BIA in the first place. As we have indicated, Dong relied almost exclusively on the spousal bootstrapping rule throughout the administrative proceedings. He did not mention \"other resistance\" at all until his second appeal to the BIA. Even then, he did not argue that he had resisted a coercive population control program by leaving China. Rather, he asked for a remand so that he could attempt to muster unspecified evidence of resistance:</p>\n<blockquote>In the alternative, the case should be remanded to allow the respondent to testify more fully as to the events that occurred when his wife was forcibly aborted and sterilized to see if his actions may have constituted \"other resistance\" as required by the recent Second Circuit decision in <i>Lin v. U.S. Department of Justice.</i><sup>[3]</sup></blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> Putting to one side the issue of whether the BIA erroneously denied Dong's request for a remand for further factfinding, <i>see infra,</i> we cannot fault the Board for failing to consider an altogether different merits argument that was never urged before it. <i>See </i><i>Yu v. Gonzales,</i> 502 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir.2007) (rejecting the applicant's attempt to \"change the nature of [her forced abortion] claim by shifting her focus in the appellate tribunals\" to her resistance efforts).</p>\n<p>Dong's second request  that we find as a matter of law that his flight renders him eligible for asylum  fails for similar reasons. We have consistently held that \"arguments not raised before the BIA are waived due to a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\" <i>See </i><i>Molina De Massenet v. Gonzales,</i> 485 F.3d 661, 664 (1st Cir.2007). As we have explained, Dong never argued before the BIA that his flight from China constituted \"other resistance to a coercive population control program.\" His attempt to raise that argument for the first time in this court is therefore unavailing. <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Olujoke v. Gonzales,</i> 411 F.3d 16, 22-23 (1st Cir.2005) (rejecting an applicant's attempt to \"resurrect\" a claim in the court of appeals where the applicant \"failed to make any developed argumentation in support of that claim before the BIA\").</p>\n<p>Finally, to the extent that Dong means to challenge the BIA's refusal to remand for further factfinding, we review that decision for abuse of discretion. <i>Pakasi v. Holder,</i> 577 F.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir. 2009). We may reverse under that deferential standard only if the denial was \"made without a rational explanation, inexplicably departed from the established policies, or rested on an impermissible basis.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). None of those factors are present here. Dong did not explain to the BIA what additional facts he would have presented if the case had been remanded. Nor did the record before the BIA contain any obvious signs of resistance that could have been explored further. Faced with a record and briefs that failed to show how further factfinding would aid Dong, the BIA properly exercised its discretion in declining to remand. <i>See id.</i> (finding that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in refusing to remand when the applicant failed to present any evidence that would have altered the outcome on remand).</p>\n<p>The petition for review is <i>DENIED.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Two other circuits reached the same conclusion in subsequent cases. <i>See </i><i>Yu v. U.S. Att'y Gen.,</i> 568 F.3d 1328, 1332-33 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam); <i>Lin-Zheng v. Att'y Gen.,</i> 557 F.3d 147, 149 (3d Cir.2009) (en banc).</p>\n<p>[2]  Dong's brief is not a model of clarity with respect to the relief requested. For the sake of thoroughness, we consider all of the possibilities suggested by his filings.</p>\n<p>[3]  Dong apparently meant to invoke the <i>Lin</i> court's observation that the spouse of an individual who has been subjected to coercive population control measures, although not automatically eligible for asylum, might nevertheless be eligible under section 601(a)'s \"other resistance\" provision. <i>See </i><i>Lin,</i> 494 F.3d at 313.</p>\n\n</div>",

No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546, which extends refugee status to certain individuals who have been or will be subjected to coercive population control procedures such as involuntary sterilization, or who have been or will be persecuted for resisting a coercive population control program.</p>\n<p>Concluding that the BIA did not err, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Dong, a citizen of China, entered the United States without admission or parole at an unknown port of entry on the Mexican border on March 10, 2004.

His argument suggests that the BIA arbitrarily failed to consider a potentially outcome-determinative argument that was clearly before it. <i>Cf. </i><i>Cordero-Trejo v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195749\"><a href=\"/opinion/195749/cordero-trejo-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span>, 492 (1st Cir.1994) (remanding for further proceedings because, inter alia, the BIA failed to consider the applicant's \"pattern or practice\" persecution argument); <i>Abdulai v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771995\"><a href=\"/opinion/771995/olufemi-yussef-abdulai-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span>, 549 (3d Cir.2001) (\"A decisionmaker must actually consider the evidence and argument that a party presents.\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). It is true that the BIA did not consider whether Dong's flight amounted to \"other resistance.\" However, Dong never presented that argument to the BIA in the first place. As we have indicated, Dong relied almost exclusively on the spousal bootstrapping rule throughout the administrative proceedings. He did not mention \"other resistance\" at all until his second appeal to the BIA. Even then, he did not argue that he had resisted a coercive population control program by leaving China. Rather, he asked for a remand so that he could attempt to muster unspecified evidence of resistance:</p>\n<blockquote>In the alternative, the case should be remanded to allow the respondent to testify more fully as to the events that occurred when his wife was forcibly aborted and sterilized to see if his actions may have constituted \"other resistance\" as required by the recent Second Circuit decision in <i>Lin v. U.S. Department of Justice.</i><sup>[3]</sup></blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> Putting to one side the issue of whether the BIA erroneously denied Dong's request for a remand for further factfinding, <i>see infra,</i> we cannot fault the Board for failing to consider an altogether different merits argument that was never urged before it. <i>See </i><i>Yu v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202925\"><a href=\"/opinion/202925/yu-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2007) (rejecting the applicant's attempt to \"change the nature of [her forced abortion] claim by shifting her focus in the appellate tribunals\" to her resistance efforts).</p>\n<p>Dong's second request  that we find as a matter of law that his flight renders him eligible for asylum  fails for similar reasons. We have consistently held that \"arguments not raised before the BIA are waived due to a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\" <i>See </i><i>Molina De Massenet v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202738\"><a href=\"/opinion/202738/molina-de-massenet-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></a></span>, 664 (1st Cir.2007). As we have explained, Dong never argued before the BIA that his flight from China constituted \"other resistance to a coercive population control program.\" His attempt to raise that argument for the first time in this court is therefore unavailing. <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Olujoke v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></span>, 22-23 (1st Cir.2005) (rejecting an applicant's attempt to \"resurrect\" a claim in the court of appeals where the applicant \"failed to make any developed argumentation in support of that claim before the BIA\").</p>\n<p>Finally, to the extent that Dong means to challenge the BIA's refusal to remand for further factfinding, we review that decision for abuse of discretion. <i>Pakasi v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203955\"><a href=\"/opinion/203955/pakasi-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">577</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir. 2009). We may reverse under that deferential standard only if the denial was \"made without a rational explanation, inexplicably departed from the established policies, or rested on an impermissible basis.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). None of those factors are present here. Dong did not explain to the BIA what additional facts he would have presented if the case had been remanded. Nor did the record before the BIA contain any obvious signs of resistance that could have been explored further. Faced with a record and briefs that failed to show how further factfinding would aid Dong, the BIA properly exercised its discretion in declining to remand. <i>See id.</i> (finding that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in refusing to remand when the applicant failed to present any evidence that would have altered the outcome on remand).</p>\n<p>The petition for review is <i>DENIED.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Two other circuits reached the same conclusion in subsequent cases. <i>See </i><i>Yu v. U.S. Att'y Gen.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78354\"><a href=\"/opinion/78354/yu-v-us-atty-gen/\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1328</span></a></span>, 1332-33 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam); <i>Lin-Zheng v. Att'y Gen.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1433525\"><a href=\"/opinion/1433525/lin-zheng-v-atty-gen/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span>, 149 (3d Cir.2009) (en banc).</p>\n<p>[2]  Dong's brief is not a model of clarity with respect to the relief requested. For the sake of thoroughness, we consider all of the possibilities suggested by his filings.</p>\n<p>[3]  Dong apparently meant to invoke the <i>Lin</i> court's observation that the spouse of an individual who has been subjected to coercive population control measures, although not automatically eligible for asylum, might nevertheless be eligible under section 601(a)'s \"other resistance\" provision. <i>See </i><i>Lin,</i> 494 F.3d at 313.</p>\n\n</div>",
