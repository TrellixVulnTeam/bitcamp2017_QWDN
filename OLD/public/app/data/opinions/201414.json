This appeal represents one part of\n\na larger dispute between Global NAPs, a competitive local exchange\n\ncarrier (CLEC), and Verizon New England, Inc., an incumbent local\n\nexchange   carrier     (ILEC),   in       their   attempt   to   reach   an\n\ninterconnection agreement under the Telecommunications Act of 1996\n\n(TCA), Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56 (codified as amended in\n\nscattered sections of 47 U.S.C.).             The TCA sets up detailed\n\nprocedures for the creation of interconnection agreements in order\n\nto serve the TCA's goal of fostering competition in local telephone\n\nmarkets.   Those procedures allow competing carriers to gain access\n\nto   the   incumbent    carrier's     telecommunications     network     and\n\nfacilities and govern the terms and fees of that access.\n\n           Global NAPs appeals from the district court's judgment\n\naffirming a February 19, 2003 order of the Massachusetts Department\n\nof Telecommunications and Energy (DTE), the state commission given\n\nthe power to arbitrate disputes over interconnection agreements\n\nunder the TCA.       47 U.S.C. § 252(b).          The February 19, 2003\n\nadministrative order followed an earlier December 12, 2002 DTE\n\norder deciding the arbitration between Verizon and Global NAPs.\n\nThat arbitration had been initiated by Global NAPs after a period\n\nof negotiation with Verizon failed to produce an agreement on all\n\nissues.\n\n           The challenged February 19 order allowed a remedial\n\nmotion by Verizon to force Global NAPs to sign an interconnection\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fagreement consistent with the terms of the DTE's earlier December\n\n12 arbitration order.   Verizon brought this motion because Global\n\nNAPs had balked at the December 12 arbitration order, said it was\n\nnot bound by the result of the arbitration, and that it was instead\n\nexercising what it thought was its unconditional right under\n\n§ 252(i) of the Act to adopt the terms of an interconnection\n\nagreement Verizon had with Sprint, which preexisted Global NAPs'\n\narbitration request.\n\n          The merits of the underlying December arbitration order\n\nfrom the DTE are not before us.       The merits issue before us is\n\nwhether in its February order the DTE acted in violation of\n\n§ 252(i) of the TCA in precluding Global NAPs from nullifying and\n\navoiding the effect of the arbitration –- which binds Global NAPs\n\nand Verizon to an agreement –- by instead opting into the terms of\n\nan older agreement Verizon had signed with Sprint.   If Global NAPs\n\nwere free to so opt in, that would moot the challenge to the\n\nunderlying December arbitration order.      We find that the DTE's\n\nFebruary 19 order was not in violation of the TCA and affirm the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n                                I.\n\n          Before the passage of the TCA, local telephone service\n\nwas provided mainly by state-regulated monopolies, such as Verizon.\n\nThese monopolies, the ILECs, owned all networks and facilities\n\n(including telephone lines, poles, trunks, etc.) attendant to the\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fprovision of local telephone service.                       See AT&T Corp. v. Iowa\n\nUtils. Bd., 525 U.S. 366, 371 (1999).                  A purpose of the TCA was to\n\nend   the    local    telephone          monopolies      and    create    a    national\n\ntelecommunications policy that strongly favored competition in\n\nlocal telephone markets. See P.R. Tel. Co. v. Telecomm. Regulatory\n\nBd. of P.R., 189 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            Section 251 of the TCA imposes obligations on both\n\ncompeting carriers and incumbent carriers.                       Section 251(a)(1)\n\nimposes a     duty    on    all    carriers      \"to    interconnect      directly      or\n\nindirectly     with        the     facilities       and       equipment       of     other\n\ntelecommunications carriers.\"               47 U.S.C. § 251(a)(1).                 The TCA\n\nimposes on an incumbent carrier more stringent duties, including\n\n\"the duty     to   permit        other   carriers      to    interconnect      with    its\n\nfacilities, to provide other carriers with access to elements of\n\nits local network on an 'unbundled' basis, to sell to other\n\ncarriers at wholesale prices the services that it provides to its\n\ncustomers, and to negotiate interconnection agreements in good\n\nfaith.\"     P.R. Tel. Co., 189 F.3d at 8; see 47 U.S.C. § 251(c).\n\n            Section 252 provides the procedures for the creation of\n\ninterconnection agreements.1 Interconnection agreements govern the\n\n\n      1\n           In addition to pursuing an interconnection agreement, a\ncompetitor may also seek access to the incumbent's network by\npurchasing local telephone services at wholesale rates for resale\nto end users or by leasing elements of the incumbent's network on\nan \"unbundled basis.\" 47 U.S.C. § 251(c); U.S. West Communication,\nInc. v. Sprint Communication Co., 275 F.3d 1241, 1244 (10th Cir.\n2002).\n\n                                           -4-\n\fterms and conditions by which CLECs may gain access to the ILECs'\n\nlocal telephone network and facilities, thus allowing the CLECs to\n\nprovide   competing            local    telephone         service.         Incumbents       and\n\ncompetitors may negotiate freely an interconnection agreement, and\n\nboth parties have a duty to negotiate in good faith.                               47 U.S.C.\n\n§   251(c)(1).          If      the    parties       reach     an     agreement       through\n\nnegotiation,       that      agreement       need    not     satisfy    the       substantive\n\nrequirements of         §§ 251(b) and (c).             Id. § 252(a)(1).           If after a\n\nperiod of negotiation the parties are not able to come to an\n\nagreement    on    some        issues,      either    party     may    petition      a    state\n\ncommission    to    decide        those      open    issues     in    arbitration.          Id.\n\n§ 252(b)(1).       The commission then has the authority to decide the\n\nopen issues between the parties, and to impose conditions on the\n\nparties for the implementation of the terms of arbitration into an\n\nagreement.        Id.   § 252(b)(4)(C).              In deciding those issues, the\n\ncommission must \"ensure that such resolution and conditions meet\n\nthe requirements of section 251 of this title, including the\n\nregulations prescribed by the [Federal Communications Commission]\n\npursuant to section 251.\"                   Id. § 252(c)(1).               Further, either\n\nparty's refusal         to     negotiate      or     to     cooperate      with    the    state\n\ncommission acting as arbitrator constitutes a breach of its duty to\n\nnegotiate in good faith.               Id. § 252(b)(5).\n\n             In    addition,          the   TCA     requires       ILECs    to     allow    any\n\nrequesting    CLEC        to    adopt       the     terms    and     conditions      of    any\n\n\n                                              -5-\n\finterconnection agreement it has with any other CLEC, provided that\n\nagreement      has        been    approved      by     the     requisite        state\n\ntelecommunications commission.           Id. § 252(i).\n\n            Once a negotiated or arbitrated agreement is completed,\n\nit must be submitted to the state commission for approval.                          Id.\n\n§ 252(e)(1). The commission may reject any negotiated agreement if\n\nit    discriminates       against   a   third    party       carrier    or    if    its\n\nimplementation       is    \"not   consistent    with     the    public       interest,\n\nconvenience, and necessity.\"            Id. § 252(e)(2)(A).          The commission\n\nmay   reject   an    arbitrated     agreement    if    it    fails     to    meet   the\n\nsubstantive requirements of § 251, including the FCC's implementing\n\nregulations, or the pricing standards set forth in § 252(d).                        Id.\n\n§ 252(e)(2)(B).       That commission decision is subject to federal\n\njudicial review:\n\n            In any case in which a State commission makes\n            a determination under this section, any party\n            aggrieved by such determination may bring an\n            action in an appropriate Federal district\n            court to determine whether the agreement or\n            statement meets the requirements of section\n            251 of this title and this section.\n\nId. § 252(e)(6).\n\n            Verizon and Global NAPs began the negotiation process for\n\na new interconnection agreement in early 2002, because their\n\nprevious agreement was approaching expiration.                  On July 30, 2002,\n\nGlobal NAPs filed a petition with the DTE to arbitrate several\n\nissues on which the parties could not agree.                   The DTE issued an\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\forder on December 12, 2002, resolving all open issues and ordering\n\nthe parties to incorporate the arbitrated terms into an agreement\n\nand file that agreement with the DTE within 21 days, or by January\n\n2, 2003.    The DTE allowed the parties' joint motion for extension\n\nof time to file the agreement until January 17, 2003.\n\n            On December 30, 2002, Global NAPs brought an action in\n\nfederal    district   court   challenging       the   merits   of   the    DTE's\n\narbitration determination.2        The merits of that December 12, 2002\n\nDTE order are not before us.\n\n            On January 9, 2003, Global NAPs informed Verizon that,\n\nrather    than   entering   into   the    agreement    embodying    the    DTE's\n\narbitration decision, it would seek to adopt the terms of a\n\npreexisting December 19, 2001 agreement Verizon had with Sprint\n\n(\"Sprint   agreement\").       Global     NAPs   contended   that    it    has   an\n\nunconditional right to do so pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 252(i).               Global\n\nNAPs said its adoption of the preexisting Sprint agreement was\n\nconsistent with the arbitration order, under which Global NAPs\n\nretained its § 252(i) rights.\n\n            On January 16, 2003, Global NAPs informed the DTE of its\n\nintention to opt into the Sprint agreement, in place of the\n\n\n     2\n           The most important contested issue in that arbitration\nbetween the parties relates to the reciprocal compensation\nrequirements between ILECs and CLECs for toll-free calls placed by\nthe ILEC's customers to a CLEC's internet service provider (ISP)\ncustomers.   This issue has prompted much litigation, including\nissues concerning the validity of FCC rulings on the issue. See,\ne.g., WorldCom, Inc. v. FCC, 288 F.3d 429 (D.C. Cir. 2002).\n\n                                     -7-\n\farbitrated agreement.     In response, on January 17, 2003, Verizon\n\nfiled a motion with the DTE to approve the arbitration order,\n\nseeking, in essence, to force Global NAPs to execute an agreement\n\nconsistent with the arbitration order, or alternatively, should the\n\nDTE allow Global NAPs to opt into the Sprint agreement, to order\n\nthat the \"agreement be modified to reflect the [DTE]'s legal and\n\npolicy determinations set forth in the Arbitration Order.\"\n\n            On February 19, 2003, the DTE granted the initial portion\n\nof Verizon's motion and ordered the parties to sign and file an\n\nagreement consistent with the initial arbitration order.          That\n\nFebruary 19, 2003 order is the subject of this appeal.    All parties\n\nagree that this order left Global NAPs free to challenge the\n\nsubstance    of   the   December   12,   2002   arbitration   order.\n\n            In the February 19 order, the DTE rejected Global NAPs'\n\nclaim that it retained the unconditional right to opt into the\n\nSprint Agreement even after the DTE issued its arbitration order.\n\nThe DTE first held that a final arbitration order pursuant to\n\n§ 252(b) is binding on both parties,3 noting that it had always\n\n\n     3\n          The DTE also rejected Global NAPs' claim that when the\nFCC stated, in the Local Competition Order ¶ 1293, that \"competing\nproviders do not have an affirmative duty to enter into agreements\nunder section 252,\" the FCC meant that CLECs were not bound by the\nresults of an state arbitration under § 252(b). Local Competition\nOrder, 11 F.C.C.R. 15499, 16131 (1996).   Rather, the DTE held that\na fuller reading of the TCA and FCC rules shows that this paragraph\nstood for the narrower proposition that competing carriers, unlike\nincumbents, cannot be forced to enter into an interconnection\nagreement, but rather can purchase services directly through the\nincumbent's tariff. The DTE held that it does not mean that CLECs\n\n                                   -8-\n\frequired that arbitration be binding on both parties. It held that\n\nits   rule   that    arbitrations   be    binding   on   both   parties    was\n\nconsistent    with   FCC   regulation.     See 47    C.F.R.     §   51.807(h).\n\nFurther, the DTE noted that the FCC's Local Competition Order,\n\nwhich embodies the FCC's initial post-enactment interpretation of\n\nthe statute, stated that the states may consider the FCC's rules\n\nwhen implementing their own standards for arbitration.               See Local\n\nCompetition Order, 11 F.C.C.R.       15499, 16127 (1996).\n\n             Further, the DTE held that since the arbitration order\n\ndirected the parties to file an agreement containing the arbitrated\n\nterms, and provided no alternatives, Global NAPs' attempt to opt\n\ninto the Sprint agreement was in violation of that earlier order.\n\nThe DTE held that \"[t]he § 252(i) adoption process permits a CLEC,\n\nduring the negotiation process, to opt into another carrier's\n\ncontract, not to do so after a decision has been reached through\n\narbitration.\"\n\n             It also noted that Global NAPs' interpretation of the TCA\n\nwas contrary to public policy, as it would allow carriers to \"game\n\nthe system\" by always attempting to arbitrate, and if unhappy with\n\nthe results, merely to opt into an existing agreement.4               The DTE\n\n\ncan avoid the terms of a valid arbitration order.\n      4\n         The DTE reasoned that competing carriers would have no\nincentive to negotiate and would always seek arbitration, because\nthe ability to opt into an existing agreement post-arbitration\nwould mean that such competitors could only benefit and never be\nmade worse off by arbitration. That would waste the DTE's limited\n\n                                    -9-\n\fordered the parties to file an agreement consistent with the\n\ninitial arbitration order within seven days.          The parties signed\n\nand entered an agreement consistent with the court's ruling, under\n\nGlobal NAPs' protest.    The DTE did not, contrary to Global NAPs'\n\nassertion, hold that a party to an arbitrated agreement can never\n\nexercise rights under § 252(i).         It also did not, contrary to\n\nVerizon's   assertion,   hold   that    a   party   subject   to   a   valid\n\narbitration order could never, under § 252(i), take advantage of\n\nterms in a previously available agreement.\n\n            On March 6, 2003, Global NAPs filed a second action in\n\ndistrict court, this time challenging the DTE's February 19 order.\n\n            On March 11, 2003, all parties to the second litigation\n\n(Global NAPs, Verizon, and the DTE) filed a joint motion to\n\nconsolidate Global NAPs' two actions.       In that motion, the parties\n\nproposed that the district court rule on Global NAPs' challenge of\n\nthe DTE's February 19 order –- whether Global NAPs is permitted to\n\nopt into the Sprint Agreement –- prior to ruling on its challenge\n\nto the DTE's underlying arbitration order –- the merits of the\n\narbitration agreement.    The district court granted the motion and\n\naccepted the parties' briefing schedule, under which the parties\n\nfiled cross motions for summary judgment in the first action on the\n\nissue whether § 252(i) would permit Global NAPs to opt into the\n\nSprint agreement despite the existence of the DTE's arbitration\n\n\nresources and be unduly burdensome to incumbents.\n\n                                 -10-\n\forder to the contrary.     The district court granted Verizon's and\n\nthe DTE's motions for summary judgment, and denied Global NAPs'\n\nmotion.     Global NAPs timely appealed.\n\n                                  II.\n\nAppellate Jurisdiction\n\n            The parties agree the federal courts have subject matter\n\njurisdiction to review state agency determinations under the TCA\n\nfor compliance with federal law, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\n\nVerizon Md., Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of Md., 535 U.S. 635, 642\n\n(2002).     See also, 47 U.S.C. § 252(e)(6).\n\n             Verizon initially argues that this court lacks appellate\n\njurisdiction to hear Global NAPs' appeal due to (1) the lack of a\n\nfinal judgment under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and (2) lack of standing in\n\nGlobal NAPs.     The DTE does not join Verizon in arguing lack of\n\nappellate jurisdiction or lack of standing, but briefs the case on\n\nthe merits.\n\n             Verizon argues that the district court's ruling was not\n\na   final    judgment   because   Global   NAPs'   two   actions   were\n\nconsolidated, thus rendering them one case, and the grant of\n\nsummary judgment disposed of only one of the two consolidated\n\ncases.    This argument is without merit.      The disposition of one\n\ncase in a consolidated action is a final and appealable judgment\n\nunless the cases were consolidated \"for all purposes.\"         See Bay\n\nState HMO Management, Inc. v. Tingley Sys., Inc., 181 F.3d 174, 178\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fn.3 (1st Cir. 1999).          In moving to consolidate these cases, the\n\nparties expressly requested that the district court review the\n\nFebruary 12, 2003 DTE order before proceeding with its review of\n\nthe December 12, 2002 order, and the district court agreed to do\n\nso.5       Review of the merits of the December 12, 2002 arbitration\n\norder was, in essence, stayed pending the court's determination of\n\nthe challenge      to   the   second   DTE    order;   the    parties   proposed\n\ncompletely separate briefing schedules for the review of the two\n\nconsolidated      cases.       Verizon's      claim    that   the   cases    were\n\nconsolidated \"for all purposes\" is wrong and Verizon's last minute\n\nassertion is inconsistent with how it presented its case in the\n\ntrial court.\n\n              These circumstances bring the case squarely within the\n\nbounds of In re Massachusetts Helicopter Airlines, Inc., 469 F.2d\n\n439 (1st Cir. 1972).       There, this court determined that the claims\n\nin a consolidated action remained separate, and therefore a Rule\n\n54(b) determination was not required for appellate jurisdiction to\n\nbe proper, because \"[e]xcept for the consolidation of the[] cases\n\nfor the convenience of pre-trial and trial procedure, the cases\n\nmaintained their separate identities throughout the litigation.\n\nSeparate judgments were entered in each of the five cases.\"                 Id. at\n\n441.       We found this to be consistent with the theory behind\n\n\n       5\n          Further, we note that Verizon did not move to challenge\njurisdiction upon the filing of Global NAPs' appeal, waiting\ninstead until the filing of its brief to do so.\n\n                                       -12-\n\fconsolidation, which was a procedural mechanism meant to serve the\n\npurposes of judicial economy and convenience of the parties, as\n\nhere, but not to alter the substantial rights the parties had in\n\nthe separate actions.6      Id.\n\n           Verizon relies on a notation in the district court docket\n\nfrom the clerk of court that the second complaint, i.e. the present\n\ncase, was consolidated \"for all future proceedings,\" and that this\n\nremoves it from the Massachusetts Helicopter rule.         See Bay State\n\nHMO Management, Inc, v. Tingley Sys., Inc., 181 F.3d 174, 178 n.3.\n\nThe reality of the situation is that the consolidation was for\n\npurposes of convenience and efficiency.\n\n           Verizon   also     urges   us   to   overrule   Massachusetts\n\nHelicopter in favor of the Ninth Circuit rule in Huene v. United\n\nStates, 743 F.2d 703, 705 (9th Cir. 1984), also followed in Trinity\n\nBroad. Corp. v. Eller, 827 F.2d 673, 675 (10th Cir. 1987) and\n\nSpraytex, Inc. v. DJS&T & Homax Corp, 96 F.3d 1377, 1382 (Fed. Cir.\n\n1996).   The advantage, it says, of the Ninth Circuit rule is that\n\nit provides a bright line –- no ruling in a consolidated case may\n\nbe appealed until there is an ultimate final judgment on all\n\nmatters.   That is true.     The disadvantage of the rule is that it\n\nmay cause injustice on particular facts, and the rule acts as a\n\n\n\n     6\n           Verizon's attempt to characterize the district court's\norder as a grant of partial summary judgment is in error. There is\nnothing in the district court's memorandum or judgment that\nsuggests it was a grant of partial summary judgment.\n\n                                  -13-\n\fdisincentive which may prevent consolidation for purely pragmatic\n\nreasons of convenience and efficiency.\n\n            In   any   event,   our    adherence     to   the    Massachusetts\n\nHelicopter rule was reaffirmed more recently in Bay State HMO\n\nManagement, 181 F.3d at 178 n.3.             As a panel, we are not free to\n\noverrule circuit precedent.      The district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment is a final order within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n            Verizon's challenge to Global NAPs' standing to pursue an\n\nappeal is also without merit.         Verizon's claim of lack of standing\n\nseems to be predicated on the notion that, if Global NAPs is\n\nallowed to opt into the Sprint agreement, the DTE will construe the\n\nSprint agreement in a manner consistent with the terms of the\n\narbitration order, and thus Global NAPs will be no better off.\n\n            Global NAPs disagrees, and recites injury to itself.\n\nFurther, Verizon's position is contrary to its position below in\n\nseveral respects.      Among them is that Verizon requested from the\n\nDTE that, should the DTE allow Global NAPs to adopt the Sprint\n\nagreement, then the agreement be modified to adopt legal and policy\n\ndeterminations made in the arbitration order.                   If the Sprint\n\nagreement   were   not   materially      different    from      the   challenged\n\nagreement, such modification would not be necessary.                     Indeed,\n\nGlobal NAPs would not be trying to join the Sprint agreement.\n\nFurther, the possibility that the DTE might construe the Sprint\n\nagreement consistently with the December 12 arbitration order, and\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fthat doing so would be upheld against a likely challenge, is\n\ninsufficient to render Global NAPs without standing in this case.\n\nWe reject the lack of standing argument.\n\n                                III.\n\nInterpretation of the TCA § 252(i)\n\n           The precise legal question under review is narrow, though\n\none of first impression in the circuit courts of appeals:    does a\n\ncompeting carrier have an unconditional right, under § 252(i) of\n\nthe TCA, to avoid the terms of a final arbitration order from a\n\nstate telecommunications commission, adjudicating a dispute between\n\nthe CLEC and ILEC, by seeking to opt into the terms of a previous\n\ninterconnection agreement that the ILEC has with another CLEC?\n\nThis is an issue of federal statutory interpretation of the TCA.7\n\nWe agree with the DTE and the district court that the TCA grants no\n\nsuch right.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n           This circuit has not previously articulated precisely the\n\nstandard of judicial review of state agency determinations under\n\nthe TCA.   Issues of law, as here, are subject to de novo review,\n\nP.R. Tel. Co. v. Telecomm. Regulatory Bd. of P.R., 189 F.3d 1, 7\n\n\n\n    7\n          Since the FCC, and not the individual state commissions,\nis the agency with the power granted by Congress to administer the\nTCA, through the formulation of policy, rulemaking, and regulation,\nwe do not afford deference to the DTE's interpretation of the\nstatute under Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council,\nInc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984).\n\n                                -15-\n\f(1st Cir. 1999), and we apply that standard to state agency\n\ndeterminations under the TCA.8\n\n              In interpreting a statute, we begin with the text.\n\nBedRoc Ltd. v. United States, 124 S. Ct. 1587, 1593 (2004).\n\nSection 252(i) states:\n\n              A local exchange carrier shall make available\n              any interconnection, service, or network\n              element provided under an agreement approved\n              under this section to which it is a party to\n              any   other   requesting   telecommunications\n              carrier upon the same terms and conditions as\n              those provided in the agreement.\n\n47 U.S.C. § 252(i).       In urging the court to hold that § 252(i)\n\ngives    it   an   unconditional   right   to   avoid   the   terms   of   an\n\narbitration order and opt into a previously available agreement,\n\nGlobal NAPs points out that the text of § 252(i) does not state\n\n\n\n     8\n          Each of the Circuits that has addressed the standard of\nreview under the TCA has held that where the state agency\ndetermination rests principally on an interpretation of the TCA, de\nnovo review is applied. See, e.g., Ind. Bell Tel. Co. v. McCarty,\n362 F.3d 378, 383 (7th Cir. 2004); MCIMetro Access Transmission\nServs. v. Bellsouth Telecomms., Inc., 352 F.3d 872, 876 (4th Cir.\n2003); Coserv. Ltd. Liab. Corp. v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 350\nF.3d 482, 486 (5th Cir. 2003); U.S. West Communications, Inc. v.\nSprint Communications Co., 275 F.3d 1241, 1248 (10th Cir. 2002);\nAT&T Communications of S. States, Inc. v. BellSouth Telecomm.,\nInc., 268 F.3d 1294, 1296 (11th Cir. 2001); AT&T Communications of\nN.J. v. Verizon N.J., Inc., 270 F.3d 162, 169 (3d Cir. 2001); U.S.\nWest Communications., Inc. v. MFS Intelenet, Inc. 193 F.3d 1112,\n1117 (9th Cir. 1999). Further, other Circuits have held that where\nno error of law exists, the state agency's other determinations are\nreviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard. See, e.g.,\nMCI Telecomms. Corp. v. Ohio Bell Tel. Co., 376 F.3d 539, 548 (6th\nCir. 2004); U.S. West Communications, Inc., 275 F.3d at 1248;\nSouthwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Waller Creek Communications, Inc.,\n221 F.3d 812, 816 (5th Cir. 2000); MFS Intelenet, 193 F.3d at 1117.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fexpressly when and under what circumstances the incumbent must make\n\ninterconnection agreements available to other competitors.      From\n\nthis silence, Global NAPs argues it is free to opt in at any time\n\nit chooses.    But § 252(i) does not expressly state what Global NAPs\n\nreads it to mean either.     At best, § 252(i) is ambiguous on the\n\nsubject, if that section is read alone.    The absence of an express\n\nstatement in § 252(i) does not end the matter; the section must be\n\nread in light of the structure and intent of the statute.\n\n            Global NAPs' broad reading of § 252(i) is incorrect,\n\nbecause that reading brings § 252(i), under the circumstances of\n\nthis case, into direct conflict with, and in important aspects\n\nnegates, several other sections of the TCA.\n\n              Global NAPs' reading is inconsistent with the basic\n\narbitral power vested in the state commission. Section 252(b),\n\nentitled \"Agreements arrived at through compulsory arbitration,\"\n\nallows for either party to an interconnection agreement to petition\n\na state commission for arbitration of open issues, and grants\n\npowers to the state commission to carry out the arbitration.     Id.\n\n§ 252(b).\n\n            Global NAPs' reading is also inconsistent with the power\n\nof state commissions to make their arbitral decisions binding on\n\nboth parties.    Section 252(b)(4)(C) requires the state commission\n\nto \"resolve each issue set forth in the petition and the response,\n\nif any, by imposing appropriate conditions as required to implement\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fsubsection (c) of this section upon the parties to the agreement.\"\n\nId. § 252(b)(4)(C).           In turn, subsection (c), among other things,\n\nstates that \"a State commission shall . . . provide a schedule for\n\nimplementation of the terms and conditions by the parties to the\n\nagreement.\"        Id. § 252(c).         By allowing the commission acting as\n\narbitrator         to   place     conditions      on    both      parties       for     the\n\nimplementation of interconnection agreements, it is clear that\n\n§ 252(b)(4)(C) intends for arbitration orders to be binding on both\n\nparties.\n\n             Global NAPs responds that arbitration orders are not\n\nbinding because generally under the TCA, the obligations on CLECs\n\nare   not    equal      to   or   reciprocal     with    those    on    ILECs     and    so\n\narbitration decisions are equally asymmetrical in their results.\n\nGlobal      NAPs    also     makes   a    broader      argument    that     the       FCC's\n\nregulations, and the TCA generally, create asymmetrical rights and\n\nobligations on competitors and incumbents, and those greatly tip\n\nthe scale in favor of competitors.                  It argues that under § 252\n\nincumbents are required to enter into interconnection agreements,\n\nbut competitors are not.             Thus Global NAPs argues that, to the\n\nextent there is ambiguity as to the scope of § 252(i), it should be\n\nconstrued      broadly       in   favor    of    competitors      and     against       the\n\nincumbent, consistent with the asymmetry created by the statute and\n\nregulations as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f             This argument, however, ignores the important fact that\n\n§   252(b)   is   not   one   of   the    areas   of    the   TCA   that   creates\n\nasymmetrical obligations on the parties.               Section 252(b)(1) allows\n\neither party to the negotiation to petition for arbitration.\n\nSection 252(b)(4) allows the state commission to impose conditions\n\non both parties in order to carry out the arbitration.                        And\n\n§ 252(b)(5) creates a duty for both parties to cooperate with the\n\narbitration at the risk of breaching the duty both parties have,\n\nunder § 252(a), to negotiate in good faith.               There is no basis for\n\nGlobal NAPs' reading § 252(i) as somehow turning the parallel\n\nobligations that run throughout § 252(b) into merely one-way\n\nobligations.\n\n             Further, Global NAPs' reading is in conflict with the\n\nstatutory duties of good faith and cooperation with the commission\n\nas arbitrator.     The TCA, at § 252(b)(5), states:\n\n             The refusal of any other party to the\n             negotiation to participate further in the\n             negotiations, to cooperate with the State\n             commission in carrying out its function as an\n             arbitrator, or to continue to negotiate in\n             good faith in the presence, or with the\n             assistance, of the State commission shall be\n             considered a failure to negotiate in good\n             faith.\n\nId. § 252(b)(5).        In attempting to void the terms of a valid\n\narbitration order, it is clear that Global NAPs is refusing to\n\n\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fcooperate with the DTE, in violation of its duty to negotiate in\n\ngood faith.9\n\n          Global NAPs responds by asking the court to read an\n\nimplicit limitation on the good faith requirement of § 252(b)(5) –-\n\nthat CLECs are not bound by the terms of § 252(b)(5) if they\n\nattempt to opt into a previously available contract.   Global NAPs\n\nsays that this is the effect of § 252(i).       But § 252(i) says\n\nnothing of the sort.     Rather, it is written in terms of an\n\nobligation on the part of ILECs to make agreements available to\n\npotential CLECs, not as an unconditional right on the part of CLECs\n\nto modify their clear obligations under earlier subsections of\n\n§ 252.   We read the sections consistently, and conclude that\n\n§ 252(i) is not an implicit limit on the binding effect of the\n\narbitration provisions of § 252(b)(5).   In this context, there is\n\nnothing ambiguous about the terms of § 252(b)(4)(C) and (b)(5).\n\n          Global NAPs' argument is also inconsistent with the\n\njudicial review provisions in the TCA, for determinations made by\n\na state commission:\n\n\n\n\n     9\n           The record is clear that the DTE did not consider its\norder to be a penalty. Rather, the DTE held that § 252(i) could\nnot be read to allow Global NAPs to void the terms of the binding\narbitration order by opting into an agreement available to them\nthroughout the entire period of negotiation and arbitration.\n\n                               -20-\n\f           In any case in which a State commission makes\n           a determination under this section, any party\n           aggrieved by such determination may bring an\n           action in an appropriate Federal district\n           court to determine whether the agreement or\n           statement meets the requirements of section\n           251 of this title and this section.\n\n47 U.S.C. § 252(e)(6). If \"any party aggrieved by a determination\"\n\nfeels the arbitral determination is contrary to the TCA, its remedy\n\nis through judicial review, not self-help.\n\n           In addition to our reading of the statutory sections,\n\nthere is   another    source   of   law    to   consider:   FCC   regulations\n\ninterpreting the statutory sections at issue, albeit on different\n\npoints.    The FCC's interpretation is relevant in two senses.\n\nFirst, under § 252(c)(1), the DTE itself must \"ensure that such\n\nresolution and conditions meet the requirements of section 251 of\n\nthis title, including the regulations prescribed by the Commission\n\npursuant to section 251.\"      Id. § 252(c)(1).      Second, to the extent\n\nthere is ambiguity in the statute, present here in § 252(i) but not\n\nin § 252(b)(4)(C) and (b)(5), deference is due to the FCC's\n\nreasonable interpretation.      Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res.\n\nDef. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984).10\n\n           The FCC has not interpreted the statute on the precise\n\nquestion before us.    That is not surprising, since the issue is one\n\n\n     10\n          The FCC is explicitly granted rulemaking authority under\nthe TCA, 47 U.S.C. § 201(b), and the Supreme Court has held that\nthis includes rulemaking power for §§ 251 and 252, without being\nlimited to interstate and foreign matters.     AT&T Corp. v. Iowa\nUtils. Bd., 525 U.S. 366, 378 (1999).\n\n                                    -21-\n\fof the power of a state commission.                 The TCA is an interwoven whole\n\nand the FCC's interpretation of related strands of the weaving is\n\nrelevant, at least by analogy.\n\n            Both sides cite to the FCC's regulation interpreting\n\n§ 252(i), found at 47 C.F.R. § 51.809, in support                                 of their\n\ninterpretation       of   the    statute.            The    regulation,        47    C.F.R.\n\n§ 51.809(b), provides two express limitations to a CLEC's opt in\n\nrights under § 252(i): an incumbent need not make available the\n\nterms of an interconnection agreement to a particular competitor 1)\n\nif it shows that the costs of providing a service will be greater\n\nto   the   requesting      competitor         than     it    was      to    the     original\n\nnegotiating party, or 2) if it shows that the provision of that\n\nservice is technically infeasible.                   47 C.F.R. § 51.809(b).              In\n\naddition, there is a third limitation:                       47 C.F.R. § 51.809(c)\n\nstates     that     incumbents       must     make     terms     of        interconnection\n\nagreements available to other competitors only \"for a reasonable\n\ntime\" after their approval by the state commission.\n\n            The FCC regulation 47 C.F.R. § 51.809 itself rejects\n\nGlobal NAPs' premise that § 252(i) grants an unconditional right to\n\nCLECs to adopt the terms of any interconnection agreement the ILEC\n\nhas with another CLEC.               The obligation of ILECs to make those\n\nagreements        available     to    other        CLECs    is   itself       subject     to\n\nconditions:        comparable-cost,          technical-feasibility,               and    the\n\n\n\n\n                                            -22-\n\freasonable-time restrictions are three such conditions contemplated\n\nby the regulation.11\n\n            The    reasonable-time       requirement      under    47   C.F.R.\n\n§ 51.809(c) is particularly relevant. Here, after all, the DTE has\n\nsaid it might have reached a different outcome if, during the\n\npendency of an arbitration, Global NAPs had sought to withdraw its\n\nrequest for arbitration in favor of exercising whatever opt in\n\nrights it had.      The DTE held only that once it had concluded its\n\narbitration and issued its order, Global NAPs was not free to enter\n\ninto an opt in agreement in lieu of accepting arbitrated terms and\n\nincorporating them into its agreement.                 The DTE's position is\n\nentirely    consistent    with   the    FCC    regulation's   reasonable-time\n\nrequirement.\n\n             We also consider the parties' arguments based on the\n\nFCC's Local Competition Order, which embodies the FCC's initial\n\ninterpretative rulemaking implementing the TCA after its passage in\n\n1996, as support for its interpretation of the statute. See 11\n\nF.C.C.R. 15499 (1996).         Global NAPs attempts to argue that while\n\nFCC     arbitrations     are   binding    on    both    parties,   47   C.F.R.\n\n§     51.807(h),   the   Local   Competition      Order    demonstrates   that\n\narbitrations before state agencies under § 252(b) are only binding\n\n\n       11\n           The reasoning provided for our reading of the statute\nabove, consistent with the entirety of § 252, adequately dispels\nGlobal NAPs' argument that the limitations on § 252(i) promulgated\nby the FCC in § 51.809 are the only permissible limitations that\ncould apply to that subsection.\n\n                                       -23-\n\fon incumbents.      It makes a sort of negative pregnant argument from\n\nthe FCC's Local Competition Order ¶ 1293, which states:\n\n           Absent mutual agreement to different terms,\n           the decision reached through arbitration is\n           binding.    We conclude that it would be\n           inconsistent with the 1996 Act to . . . permit\n           incumbent LECs to not be bound by an\n           arbitrated determination.    We also believe\n           that, although competing carriers do not have\n           an affirmative duty to enter into agreements\n           under section 252, a requesting carrier might\n           face penalties if, by refusing to enter into\n           an arbitrated agreement, that carrier is\n           deemed to have failed to negotiate in good\n           faith.\n\n11 F.C.C.R. at 16131.      Global NAPs contends that this renders the\n\narbitration provision a one-way ratchet: incumbents are bound by\n\nthe arbitration decision, but competitors are not.         We disagree.\n\nThe Order does not say that competitors are not required to accept\n\nthe terms of an arbitration order. Rather it says that competitors\n\nare not required \"to enter into agreements under section 252,\" and\n\nthis is clearly correct.      The law mandates that an incumbent must\n\nenter   into   an   interconnection   agreement   under   the   requisite\n\nconditions, and the competitor need not enter into an agreement\n\neven if the incumbent so desires.         It says nothing about the\n\nobligations of a competitor that is subject to the terms of a\n\nbinding arbitration order.\n\n           Significantly, the Local Competition Order does not state\n\nthat competitors have a right to use § 251(i) to avoid their\n\nobligations under a binding arbitration order.       Properly read the\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\fOrder refers to the admitted binding effect in FCC arbitrations,\n\nbut says nothing about state arbitrations.                Further, the FCC\n\nregulation's explicit statement of the binding effect on both\n\nparties supports the DTE's position.        See 47 C.F.R. § 51.807(h).\n\n            Global NAPs then makes another argument based on lack of\n\nsymmetry as to most favored nation clauses.         Global NAPs cites to\n\nLocal Competition Order ¶ 1316, as well as the Tenth Circuit's\n\ndecision in U.S. West Communications, Inc. v. Sprint Communications\n\nCo., 275 F.3d 1241 (10th Cir. 2002), to support its interpretation\n\nof   §   252(i).   Neither   is   helpful   to   Global    NAPs'   position.\n\nParagraph 1316 of the Local Competition Order states:\n\n            We further conclude that section 252(i)\n            entitles all parties with interconnection\n            agreements to \"most favored nation\" status\n            regardless of whether they include \"most\n            favored nation\" clauses in their agreements.\n            Congress's command under section 252(i) . . .\n            means that any requesting carrier may avail\n            itself of more advantageous terms and\n            conditions subsequently negotiated by any\n            other carrier for the same individual\n            interconnection, service, or element once the\n            subsequent agreement is filed with, and\n            approved by, the state commission.\n\n11 F.C.C.R. at 16139-40 (emphasis added).         Paragraph 1316's \"most\n\nfavored nation\" language deals with an issue not presented here:\n\nthe ability of a party to an existing interconnection agreement to\n\nadopt the terms of another carrier's agreement that is subsequently\n\napproved by a state commission.       The DTE's decision said nothing\n\n\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fabout Global NAPs' § 252(i) rights to adopt terms in subsequently\n\napproved agreements, nor does our decision here do so.\n\n               Global NAPs' reliance on U.S. West suffers from a similar\n\nproblem.       The question that court faced was whether the state\n\ncommission acting as arbitrator properly interpreted § 252(i) to\n\nallow a competitor to amend its interconnection agreement to take\n\nadvantage of an incumbent's tariffs, as opposed merely to an\n\nelement in another competitors' approved interconnection agreement,\n\nthat are more favorable than the prices in its agreement.                     U.S.\n\nWest, 275 F.3d at 1249.         The case did not say that a CLEC subject\n\nto a binding arbitration order can use § 252(i) to avoid the terms\n\nof that order and adopt completely the terms of a previously\n\navailable agreement.\n\n               Global NAPs makes a final, policy-based argument that\n\nreading    §    252(i)   to   prevent    it    from   opting   into   the   Sprint\n\nagreement        post-arbitration       is     both     anti-competitive      and\n\ndiscriminatory, and thus at odds with the purpose of the TCA.                  If\n\nwhat Global NAPs alleges were true, namely that the terms of the\n\nunderlying arbitration order are either contrary to law or unduly\n\nburdensome on Global NAPs (or both), the statute provides Global\n\nNAPs with a remedy –- direct review of the terms of the arbitration\n\norder in district court.          47 U.S.C. § 252(e)(6).              This is the\n\nremedy Congress provided.\n\n               Accordingly, we affirm.         Costs are awarded to Verizon.\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\f",

No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 47 U.S.C.). The TCA sets up detailed procedures for the creation of interconnection agreements in order to serve the TCA's goal of fostering competition in local telephone markets. Those procedures allow competing carriers to gain access to the incumbent carrier's telecommunications network and facilities and govern the terms and fees of that access.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs appeals from the district court's judgment affirming a February 19, 2003 order of the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy (DTE), the state commission given the power to arbitrate disputes over interconnection agreements under the TCA. 47 U.S.C. &#167; 252(b). The February 19, 2003 administrative order followed an earlier December 12, 2002 DTE order deciding the arbitration between Verizon and Global NAPs. That arbitration had been initiated by Global NAPs after a period of negotiation with Verizon failed to produce an agreement on all issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenged February 19 order allowed a remedial motion by Verizon to force Global NAPs to sign an interconnection agreement consistent with the terms of the DTE's earlier December 12 arbitration order. Verizon brought this motion because Global NAPs had balked at the December 12 arbitration order, said it was not bound by the result of the arbitration, and that it was instead exercising what it thought was its unconditional right under &#167; 252(i) of the Act to adopt the terms of an interconnection agreement Verizon had with Sprint, which preexisted Global NAPs' arbitration request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The merits of the underlying December arbitration order from the DTE are not before us. The merits issue before us is whether in its February order the DTE acted in violation of &#167; 252(i) of the TCA in precluding Global NAPs from nullifying and avoiding the effect of the arbitration &#8212; which binds Global NAPs and Verizon to an agreement &#8212; by instead opting into the terms of an older agreement Verizon had signed with Sprint. If Global NAPs were free to so opt in, that would moot the challenge to the underlying December arbitration order. We find that the DTE's February 19 order was not in violation of the TCA and affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the passage of the TCA, local telephone service was provided mainly by state-regulated monopolies, such as Verizon. These monopolies, the ILECs, owned all networks and facilities (including telephone lines, poles, trunks, etc.) attendant to the provision of local telephone service. <i>See AT &amp; T Corp. v. Iowa Utils. Bd.,</i> 525 U.S. 366, 371, 119 S.Ct. 721, 142 L.Ed.2d 835 (1999). A purpose of the TCA was to end the local telephone monopolies and create a national telecommunications policy that strongly favored competition in local telephone markets. <i>See P.R. Tel. Co. v. Telecomm. Regulatory Bd. of P.R.,</i> 189 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 251 of the TCA imposes obligations on both competing carriers and incumbent carriers. Section 251(a)(1) imposes a duty on all carriers \"to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers.\" 47 U.S.C. &#167; 251(a)(1). The TCA imposes on an incumbent carrier more stringent duties, including \"the duty to permit other carriers to interconnect with its facilities, to provide other carriers with access to elements of its local network on an `unbundled' basis, to sell to other carriers at wholesale prices the services that it provides to its customers, and to negotiate interconnection agreements in good faith.\" <i>P.R. Tel. Co.,</i> 189 F.3d at 8; <i>see</i> 47 U.S.C. &#167; 251(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 252 provides the procedures for the creation of interconnection agreements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Interconnection agreements govern the terms and conditions by which CLECs may gain access to the ILECs' local telephone network and facilities, thus allowing the CLECs to provide competing local telephone service. Incumbents and competitors may negotiate freely an interconnection agreement, and both parties have a duty to negotiate in good faith. 47 U.S.C. &#167; 251(c)(1). If the parties reach an agreement through negotiation, that agreement need not satisfy the substantive requirements of &#167;&#167; 251(b) and (c). <i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(a)(1). If after a period of negotiation the parties are not able to come to an agreement on some issues, either party may petition a state commission to decide those open issues in arbitration. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(b)(1). The commission then has the authority to decide the open issues between the parties, and to impose conditions on the parties for the implementation of the terms of arbitration into an agreement. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(b)(4)(C). In deciding those issues, the commission must \"ensure that such resolution and conditions meet the requirements of section 251 of this title, including the regulations prescribed by the [Federal Communications Commission] pursuant to section 251.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(c)(1). Further, either party's refusal to negotiate or to cooperate with the state commission acting as arbitrator constitutes a breach of its duty to negotiate in good faith. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(b)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the TCA requires ILECs to allow any requesting CLEC to adopt the terms and conditions of any interconnection agreement it has with any other CLEC, provided that agreement has been approved by the requisite state telecommunications commission. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once a negotiated or arbitrated agreement is completed, it must be submitted to the state commission for approval. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(e)(1). The commission may reject any negotiated agreement if it discriminates against a third party carrier or if its implementation is \"not consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(e)(2)(A). The commission may reject an arbitrated agreement if it fails to meet the substantive requirements of &#167; 251, including the FCC's implementing regulations, or the pricing standards set forth in &#167; 252(d). <i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(e)(2)(B).

On July 30, 2002, Global NAPs filed a petition with the DTE to arbitrate several issues on which the parties could not agree. The DTE issued an order on December 12, 2002, resolving all open issues and ordering the parties to incorporate the arbitrated terms into an agreement and file that agreement with the DTE within 21 days, or by January 2, 2003. The DTE allowed the parties' joint motion for extension of time to file the agreement until January 17, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 30, 2002, Global NAPs brought an action in federal district court challenging the merits of the DTE's arbitration determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The merits of that December 12, 2002 DTE order are not before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 9, 2003, Global NAPs informed Verizon that, rather than entering into the agreement embodying the DTE's arbitration decision, it would seek to adopt the terms of a preexisting December 19, 2001 agreement Verizon had with Sprint (\"Sprint agreement\"). Global NAPs contended that it has an unconditional right to do so pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 252(i). Global NAPs said its adoption of the preexisting Sprint agreement was consistent with the arbitration order, under which Global NAPs retained its &#167; 252(i) rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 16, 2003, Global NAPs informed the DTE of its intention to opt into the Sprint agreement, in place of the arbitrated agreement. In response, on January 17, 2003, Verizon filed a motion with the DTE to approve the arbitration order, seeking, in essence, to force Global NAPs to execute an agreement consistent with the arbitration order, or alternatively, should the DTE allow Global NAPs to opt into the Sprint agreement, to order that the \"agreement be modified to reflect the [DTE]'s legal and policy determinations set forth in the Arbitration Order.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 19, 2003, the DTE granted the initial portion of Verizon's motion and ordered the parties to sign and file an agreement consistent with the initial arbitration order. That February 19, 2003 order is the subject of this appeal. All parties agree that this order left Global NAPs free to challenge the substance of the December 12, 2002 arbitration order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the February 19 order, the DTE rejected Global NAPs' claim that it retained the unconditional right to opt into the Sprint Agreement even after the DTE issued its arbitration order. The DTE first held that a final arbitration order pursuant to &#167; 252(b) is binding on both parties,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> noting that it had always required that arbitration be binding on both parties. It held that its rule that arbitrations be binding on both parties was consistent with FCC regulation. <i>See</i> 47 C.F.R. &#167; 51.807(h). Further, the DTE noted that the FCC's Local Competition Order, which embodies the FCC's initial post-enactment interpretation of the statute, stated that the states may consider the FCC's rules when implementing their own standards for arbitration. <i>See</i> Local Competition Order, 11 F.C.C.R. 15499, 16127, 1996 WL 452885 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the DTE held that since the arbitration order directed the parties to file an agreement containing the arbitrated terms, and provided no alternatives, Global NAPs' attempt to opt into the Sprint agreement was in violation of that earlier order. The DTE held that \"[t]he &#167; 252(i) adoption process permits a CLEC, during the negotiation process, to opt into another carrier's contract, not to do so after a decision has been reached through arbitration.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It also noted that Global NAPs' interpretation of the TCA was contrary to public policy, as it would allow carriers to \"game the system\" by always attempting to arbitrate, and if unhappy with the results, merely to opt into an existing agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The DTE ordered the parties to file an agreement consistent with the initial arbitration order within seven days. The parties signed and entered an agreement consistent with the court's ruling, under Global NAPs' protest. The DTE did not, contrary to Global NAPs' assertion, hold that a party to an arbitrated agreement can never exercise rights under &#167; 252(i). It also did not, contrary to Verizon's assertion, hold that a party subject to a valid arbitration order could never, under &#167; 252(i), take advantage of terms in a previously available agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 6, 2003, Global NAPs filed a second action in district court, this time challenging the DTE's February 19 order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 11, 2003, all parties to the second litigation (Global NAPs, Verizon, and the DTE) filed a joint motion to consolidate Global NAPs' two actions. In that motion, the parties proposed that the district court rule on Global NAPs' challenge of the DTE's February 19 order &#8212; whether Global NAPs is permitted to opt into the Sprint Agreement &#8212; prior to ruling on its challenge to the DTE's underlying arbitration order &#8212; the merits of the arbitration agreement. The district court granted the motion and accepted the parties' briefing schedule, under which the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment in the first action on the issue whether &#167; 252(i) would permit Global NAPs to opt into the Sprint agreement despite the existence of the DTE's arbitration order to the contrary. The district court granted Verizon's and the DTE's motions for summary judgment, and denied Global NAPs' motion. Global NAPs timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Appellate Jurisdiction</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree the federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction to review state agency determinations under the TCA for compliance with federal law, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331. <i>Verizon Md., Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of Md.,</i> 535 U.S. 635, 642, 122 S.Ct. 1753, 152 L.Ed.2d 871 (2002). <i>See also,</i> 47 U.S.C. &#167; 252(e)(6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verizon initially argues that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction to hear Global NAPs' appeal due to (1) the lack of a final judgment under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 and (2) lack of standing in Global NAPs. The DTE does not join Verizon in arguing lack of appellate jurisdiction or lack of standing, but briefs the case on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verizon argues that the district court's ruling was not a final judgment because Global NAPs' two actions were consolidated, thus rendering them one case, and the grant of summary judgment disposed of only one of the two consolidated cases. This argument is without merit. The disposition of one case in a consolidated action is a final and appealable judgment unless the cases were consolidated \"for all purposes.\" <i>See Bay State HMO Management, Inc. v. Tingley Sys., Inc.,</i> 181 F.3d 174, 178 n. 3 (1st Cir.1999). In moving to consolidate these cases, the parties expressly requested that the district court review the February 12, 2003 DTE order before proceeding with its review of the December 12, 2002 order, and the district court agreed to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Review of the merits of the December 12, 2002 arbitration order was, in essence, stayed pending the court's determination of the challenge to the second DTE order; the parties proposed completely separate briefing schedules for the review of the two consolidated cases. Verizon's claim that the cases were consolidated \"for all purposes\" is wrong and Verizon's last minute assertion is inconsistent with how it presented its case in the trial court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These circumstances bring the case squarely within the bounds of <i>In re Massachusetts Helicopter Airlines, Inc.,</i> 469 F.2d 439 (1st Cir.1972). There, this court determined that the claims in a consolidated action remained separate, and therefore a Rule 54(b) determination was not required for appellate jurisdiction to be proper, because \"[e]xcept for the consolidation of the[ ] cases for the convenience of pre-trial and trial procedure, the cases maintained their separate identities throughout the litigation. Separate judgments were entered in each of the five cases.\" <i>Id.</i> at 441. We found this to be consistent with the theory behind consolidation, which was a procedural mechanism meant to serve the purposes of judicial economy and convenience of the parties, as here, but not to alter the substantial rights the parties had in the separate actions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verizon relies on a notation in the district court docket from the clerk of court that the second complaint, i.e. the present case, was consolidated \"for all future proceedings,\" and that this removes it from the <i>Massachusetts Helicopter</i> rule. <i>See Bay State HMO Management, Inc., v. Tingley Sys., Inc.,</i> 181 F.3d 174, 178 n. 3. The reality of the situation is that the consolidation was for purposes of convenience and efficiency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verizon also urges us to overrule <i>Massachusetts Helicopter</i> in favor of the Ninth Circuit rule in <i>Huene v. United States,</i> 743 F.2d 703, 705 (9th Cir.1984), also followed in <i>Trinity Broad. Corp. v. Eller,</i> 827 F.2d 673, 675 (10th Cir.1987) and <i>Spraytex, Inc. v. DJS&amp;T, Homax Corp.,</i> 96 F.3d 1377, 1382 (Fed.Cir.1996). The advantage, it says, of the Ninth Circuit rule is that it provides a bright line &#8212; no ruling in a consolidated case may be appealed until there is an ultimate final judgment on all matters. That is true. The disadvantage of the rule is that it may cause injustice on particular facts, and the rule acts as a disincentive which may prevent consolidation for purely pragmatic reasons of convenience and efficiency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, our adherence to the <i>Massachusetts Helicopter</i> rule was reaffirmed more recently in <i>Bay State HMO Management,</i> 181 F.3d at 178 n. 3. As a panel, we are not free to overrule circuit precedent. The district court's grant of summary judgment is a final order within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verizon's challenge to Global NAPs' standing to pursue an appeal is also without merit. Verizon's claim of lack of standing seems to be predicated on the notion that, if Global NAPs is allowed to opt into the Sprint agreement, the DTE will construe the Sprint agreement in a manner consistent with the terms of the arbitration order, and thus Global NAPs will be no better off.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs disagrees, and recites injury to itself. Further, Verizon's position is contrary to its position below in several respects. Among them is that Verizon requested from the DTE that, should the DTE allow Global NAPs to adopt the Sprint agreement, then the agreement be modified to adopt legal and policy determinations made in the arbitration order. If the Sprint agreement were not materially different from the challenged agreement, such modification would not be necessary. Indeed, Global NAPs would not be trying to join the Sprint agreement. Further, the possibility that the DTE <i>might</i> construe the Sprint agreement consistently with the December 12 arbitration order, and that doing so would be upheld against a likely challenge, is insufficient to render Global NAPs without standing in this case. We reject the lack of standing argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Interpretation of the TCA &#167; 252(i)</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precise legal question under review is narrow, though one of first impression in the circuit courts of appeals: does a competing carrier have an unconditional right, under &#167; 252(i) of the TCA, to avoid the terms of a final arbitration order from a state telecommunications commission, adjudicating a dispute between the CLEC and ILEC, by seeking to opt into the terms of a previous interconnection agreement that the ILEC has with another CLEC? This is an issue of federal statutory interpretation of the TCA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> We agree with the DTE and the district court that the TCA grants no such right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Standard of Review</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has not previously articulated precisely the standard of judicial review of state agency determinations under the TCA. Issues of law, as here, are subject to de novo review, <i>P.R. Tel. Co. v. Telecomm. Regulatory Bd. of P.R.,</i> 189 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1999), and we apply that standard to state agency determinations under the TCA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In interpreting a statute, we begin with the text. <i>BedRoc Ltd. v. United States,</i> 541 U.S. 176, 124 S.Ct. 1587, 1593, 158 L.Ed.2d 338 (2004). Section 252(i) states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A local exchange carrier shall make available any interconnection, service, or network element provided under an agreement approved under this section to which it is a party to any other requesting telecommunications carrier upon the same terms and conditions as those provided in the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">47 U.S.C. &#167; 252(i). In urging the court to hold that &#167; 252(i) gives it an unconditional right to avoid the terms of an arbitration order and opt into a previously available agreement, Global NAPs points out that the text of &#167; 252(i) does not state expressly when and under what circumstances the incumbent must make interconnection agreements available to other competitors. From this silence, Global NAPs argues it is free to opt in at any time it chooses. But &#167; 252(i) does not expressly state what Global NAPs reads it to mean either. At best, &#167; 252(i) is ambiguous on the subject, if that section is read alone. The absence of an express statement in &#167; 252(i) does not end the matter; the section must be read in light of the structure and intent of the statute. Global NAPs' broad reading of &#167; 252(i) is incorrect, because that reading brings &#167; 252(i), under the circumstances of this case, into direct conflict with, and in important aspects negates, several other sections of the TCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs' reading is inconsistent with the basic arbitral power vested in the state commission. Section 252(b), entitled \"Agreements arrived at through compulsory arbitration,\" allows for either party to an interconnection agreement to petition a state commission for arbitration of open issues, and grants powers to the state commission to carry out the arbitration. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs' reading is also inconsistent with the power of state commissions to make their arbitral decisions <i>binding on both parties.</i> Section 252(b)(4)(C) requires the state commission to \"resolve each issue set forth in the petition and the response, if any, by imposing appropriate conditions as required to implement subsection (c) of this section upon the parties to the agreement.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(b)(4)(C). In turn, subsection (c), among other things, states that \"a State commission shall ... provide a schedule for implementation of the terms and conditions by the parties to the agreement.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(c). By allowing the commission acting as arbitrator to place conditions on <i>both</i> parties for the implementation of interconnection agreements, it is clear that &#167; 252(b)(4)(C) intends for arbitration orders to be binding on both parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs responds that arbitration orders are not binding because generally under the TCA, the obligations on CLECs are not equal to or reciprocal with those on ILECs and so arbitration decisions are equally asymmetrical in their results. Global NAPs also makes a broader argument that the FCC's regulations, and the TCA generally, create asymmetrical rights and obligations on competitors and incumbents, and those greatly tip the scale in favor of competitors. It argues that under &#167; 252 incumbents are required to enter into interconnection agreements, but competitors are not. Thus Global NAPs argues that, to the extent there is ambiguity as to the scope of &#167; 252(i), it should be construed broadly in favor of competitors and against the incumbent, consistent with the asymmetry created by the statute and regulations as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument, however, ignores the important fact that &#167; 252(b) is <i>not</i> one of the areas of the TCA that creates asymmetrical obligations on the parties. Section 252(b)(1) allows either party to the negotiation to petition for arbitration. Section 252(b)(4) allows the state commission to impose conditions on both parties in order to carry out the arbitration. And &#167; 252(b)(5) creates a duty for both parties to cooperate with the arbitration at the risk of breaching the duty both parties have, under &#167; 252(a), to negotiate in good faith. There is no basis for Global NAPs' reading &#167; 252(i) as somehow turning the parallel obligations that run throughout &#167; 252(b) into merely one-way obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Global NAPs' reading is in conflict with the statutory duties of good faith and cooperation with the commission as arbitrator. The TCA, at &#167; 252(b)(5), states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The refusal of any other party to the negotiation to participate further in the negotiations, to cooperate with the State commission in carrying out its function as an arbitrator, or to continue to negotiate in good faith in the presence, or with the assistance, of the State commission shall be considered a failure to negotiate in good faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(b)(5). In attempting to void the terms of a valid arbitration order, it is clear that Global NAPs is refusing to cooperate with the DTE, in violation of its duty to negotiate in good faith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs responds by asking the court to read an implicit limitation on the good faith requirement of &#167; 252(b)(5) &#8212; that CLECs are not bound by the terms of &#167; 252(b)(5) if they attempt to opt into a previously available contract. Global NAPs says that this is the effect of &#167; 252(i). But &#167; 252(i) says nothing of the sort. Rather, it is written in terms of an obligation on the part of ILECs to make agreements available to potential CLECs, not as an unconditional right on the part of CLECs to modify their clear obligations under earlier subsections of &#167; 252. We read the sections consistently, and conclude that &#167; 252(i) is not an implicit limit on the binding effect of the arbitration provisions of &#167; 252(b)(5). In this context, there is nothing ambiguous about the terms of &#167; 252(b)(4)(C) and (b)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs' argument is also inconsistent with the judicial review provisions in the TCA, for determinations made by a state commission:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any case in which a State commission makes a determination under this section, any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section 251 of this title and this section.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">47 U.S.C. &#167; 252(e)(6). If \"any party aggrieved by a determination\" feels the arbitral determination is contrary to the TCA, its remedy is through judicial review, not self-help.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to our reading of the statutory sections, there is another source of law to consider: FCC regulations interpreting the statutory sections at issue, albeit on different points. The FCC's interpretation is relevant in two senses. First, under &#167; 252(c)(1), the DTE itself must \"ensure that such resolution and conditions meet the requirements of section 251 of this title, including the regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section 251.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(c)(1). Second, to the extent there is ambiguity in the statute, present here in &#167; 252(i) but not in &#167; 252(b)(4)(C) and (b)(5), deference is due to the FCC's reasonable interpretation. <i>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FCC has not interpreted the statute on the precise question before us. That is not surprising, since the issue is one of the power of a state commission. The TCA is an interwoven whole and the FCC's interpretation of related strands of the weaving is relevant, at least by analogy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both sides cite to the FCC's regulation interpreting &#167; 252(i), found at 47 C.F.R. &#167; 51.809, in support of their interpretation of the statute. The regulation, 47 C.F.R. &#167; 51.809(b), provides two express limitations to a CLEC's opt in rights under &#167; 252(i): an incumbent need not make available the terms of an interconnection agreement to a particular competitor 1) if it shows that the costs of providing a service will be greater to the requesting competitor than it was to the original negotiating party, or 2) if it shows that the provision of that service is technically infeasible. 47 C.F.R. &#167; 51.809(b). In addition, there is a third limitation: 47 C.F.R. &#167; 51.809(c) states that incumbents must make terms of interconnection agreements available to other competitors only \"for a reasonable time\" after their approval by the state commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FCC regulation 47 C.F.R. &#167; 51.809 itself rejects Global NAPs' premise that &#167; 252(i) grants an unconditional right to CLECs to adopt the terms of any interconnection agreement the ILEC has with another CLEC. The obligation of ILECs to make those agreements available to other CLECs is itself subject to conditions: comparable-cost, technical-feasibility, and the reasonable-time restrictions are three such conditions contemplated by the regulation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasonable-time requirement under 47 C.F.R. &#167; 51.809(c) is particularly relevant. Here, after all, the DTE has said it might have reached a different outcome if, during the pendency of an arbitration, Global NAPs had sought to withdraw its request for arbitration in favor of exercising whatever opt in rights it had. The DTE held only that once it had concluded its arbitration and issued its order, Global NAPs was not free to enter into an opt in agreement in lieu of accepting arbitrated terms and incorporating them into its agreement. The DTE's position is entirely consistent with the FCC regulation's reasonable-time requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also consider the parties' arguments based on the FCC's Local Competition Order, which embodies the FCC's initial interpretative rulemaking implementing the TCA after its passage in 1996, as support for its interpretation of the statute. <i>See</i> 11 F.C.C.R. 15499 (1996). Global NAPs attempts to argue that while FCC arbitrations are binding on both parties, 47 C.F.R. &#167; 51.807(h), the Local Competition Order demonstrates that arbitrations before state agencies under &#167; 252(b) are only binding on incumbents. It makes a sort of negative pregnant argument from the FCC's Local Competition Order &#182; 1293, which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent mutual agreement to different terms, the decision reached through arbitration is binding. We conclude that it would be inconsistent with the 1996 Act to ... permit incumbent LECs to not be bound by an arbitrated determination. We also believe that, although competing carriers do not have an affirmative duty to enter into agreements under section 252, a requesting carrier might face penalties if, by refusing to enter into an arbitrated agreement, that carrier is deemed to have failed to negotiate in good faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 F.C.C.R. at 16131, 1996 WL 452885. Global NAPs contends that this renders the arbitration provision a one-way ratchet: incumbents are bound by the arbitration decision, but competitors are not. We disagree. The Order does not say that competitors are not required to accept the terms of an arbitration order. Rather it says that competitors are not required \"to enter into agreements under section 252,\" and this is clearly correct. The law mandates that an incumbent must enter into an interconnection agreement under the requisite conditions, and the competitor need not enter into an agreement even if the incumbent so desires. It says nothing about the obligations of a competitor that is subject to the terms of a binding arbitration order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, the Local Competition Order does not state that competitors have a right to use &#167; 251(i) to avoid their obligations under a binding arbitration order. Properly read the Order refers to the admitted binding effect in FCC arbitrations, but says nothing about state arbitrations. Further, the FCC regulation's explicit statement of the binding effect on both parties supports the DTE's position. <i>See</i> 47 C.F.R. &#167; 51.807(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs then makes another argument based on lack of symmetry as to most favored nation clauses. Global NAPs cites to Local Competition Order &#182; 1316, as well as the Tenth Circuit's decision in <i>U.S. West Communications, Inc. v. Sprint Communications Co.,</i> 275 F.3d 1241 (10th Cir.2002), to support its interpretation of &#167; 252(i). Neither is helpful to Global NAPs' position. Paragraph 1316 of the Local Competition Order states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We further conclude that section 252(i) entitles all parties with interconnection agreements to \"most favored nation\" status regardless of whether they include \"most favored nation\" clauses in their agreements. Congress's command under section 252(i)... means that any requesting carrier may avail itself of more advantageous terms and conditions <i>subsequently</i> negotiated by any other carrier for the same individual interconnection, service, or element once the subsequent agreement is filed with, and approved by, the state commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 F.C.C.R. at 16139-40, 1996 WL 452885 (emphasis added). Paragraph 1316's \"most favored nation\" language deals with an issue not presented here: the ability of a party to an existing interconnection agreement to adopt the terms of another carrier's agreement that is <i>subsequently</i> approved by a state commission. The DTE's decision said nothing about Global NAPs' &#167; 252(i) rights to adopt terms in subsequently approved agreements, nor does our decision here do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs' reliance on <i>U.S. West</i> suffers from a similar problem. The question that court faced was whether the state commission acting as arbitrator properly interpreted &#167; 252(i) to allow a competitor to amend its interconnection agreement to take advantage of an incumbent's tariffs, as opposed merely to an element in another competitors' approved interconnection agreement, that are more favorable than the prices in its agreement. <i>U.S. West,</i> 275 F.3d at 1249. The case did not say that a CLEC subject to a binding arbitration order can use &#167; 252(i) to avoid the terms of that order and adopt completely the terms of a previously available agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs makes a final, policy-based argument that reading &#167; 252(i) to prevent it from opting into the Sprint agreement post-arbitration is both anti-competitive and discriminatory, and thus at odds with the purpose of the TCA. If what Global NAPs alleges were true, namely that the terms of the underlying arbitration order are either contrary to law or unduly burdensome on Global NAPs (or both), the statute provides Global NAPs with a remedy &#8212; direct review of the terms of the arbitration order in district court. 47 U.S.C. &#167; 252(e)(6).

No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 47 U.S.C.). The TCA sets up detailed procedures for the creation of interconnection agreements in order to serve the TCA's goal of fostering competition in local telephone markets. Those procedures allow competing carriers to gain access to the incumbent carrier's telecommunications network and facilities and govern the terms and fees of that access.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs appeals from the district court's judgment affirming a February 19, 2003 order of the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy (DTE), the state commission given the power to arbitrate disputes over interconnection agreements under the TCA. 47 U.S.C. &#167; 252(b). The February 19, 2003 administrative order followed an earlier December 12, 2002 DTE order deciding the arbitration between Verizon and Global NAPs. That arbitration had been initiated by Global NAPs after a period of negotiation with Verizon failed to produce an agreement on all issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenged February 19 order allowed a remedial motion by Verizon to force Global NAPs to sign an interconnection agreement consistent with the terms of the DTE's earlier December 12 arbitration order. Verizon brought this motion because Global NAPs had balked at the December 12 arbitration order, said it was not bound by the result of the arbitration, and that it was instead exercising what it thought was its unconditional right under &#167; 252(i) of the Act to adopt the terms of an interconnection agreement Verizon had with Sprint, which preexisted Global NAPs' arbitration request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The merits of the underlying December arbitration order from the DTE are not before us. The merits issue before us is whether in its February order the DTE acted in violation of &#167; 252(i) of the TCA in precluding Global NAPs from nullifying and avoiding the effect of the arbitration &#8212; which binds Global NAPs and Verizon to an agreement &#8212; by instead opting into the terms of an older agreement Verizon had signed with Sprint. If Global NAPs were free to so opt in, that would moot the challenge to the underlying December arbitration order. We find that the DTE's February 19 order was not in violation of the TCA and affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the passage of the TCA, local telephone service was provided mainly by state-regulated monopolies, such as Verizon.

Section 251(a)(1) imposes a duty on all carriers \"to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers.\" 47 U.S.C. &#167; 251(a)(1). The TCA imposes on an incumbent carrier more stringent duties, including \"the duty to permit other carriers to interconnect with its facilities, to provide other carriers with access to elements of its local network on an `unbundled' basis, to sell to other carriers at wholesale prices the services that it provides to its customers, and to negotiate interconnection agreements in good faith.\" <i>P.R.

If after a period of negotiation the parties are not able to come to an agreement on some issues, either party may petition a state commission to decide those open issues in arbitration. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(b)(1).

On July 30, 2002, Global NAPs filed a petition with the DTE to arbitrate several issues on which the parties could not agree. The DTE issued an order on December 12, 2002, resolving all open issues and ordering the parties to incorporate the arbitrated terms into an agreement and file that agreement with the DTE within 21 days, or by January 2, 2003. The DTE allowed the parties' joint motion for extension of time to file the agreement until January 17, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 30, 2002, Global NAPs brought an action in federal district court challenging the merits of the DTE's arbitration determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The merits of that December 12, 2002 DTE order are not before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 9, 2003, Global NAPs informed Verizon that, rather than entering into the agreement embodying the DTE's arbitration decision, it would seek to adopt the terms of a preexisting December 19, 2001 agreement Verizon had with Sprint (\"Sprint agreement\"). Global NAPs contended that it has an unconditional right to do so pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 252(i). Global NAPs said its adoption of the preexisting Sprint agreement was consistent with the arbitration order, under which Global NAPs retained its &#167; 252(i) rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 16, 2003, Global NAPs informed the DTE of its intention to opt into the Sprint agreement, in place of the arbitrated agreement. In response, on January 17, 2003, Verizon filed a motion with the DTE to approve the arbitration order, seeking, in essence, to force Global NAPs to execute an agreement consistent with the arbitration order, or alternatively, should the DTE allow Global NAPs to opt into the Sprint agreement, to order that the \"agreement be modified to reflect the [DTE]'s legal and policy determinations set forth in the Arbitration Order.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 19, 2003, the DTE granted the initial portion of Verizon's motion and ordered the parties to sign and file an agreement consistent with the initial arbitration order. That February 19, 2003 order is the subject of this appeal. All parties agree that this order left Global NAPs free to challenge the substance of the December 12, 2002 arbitration order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the February 19 order, the DTE rejected Global NAPs' claim that it retained the unconditional right to opt into the Sprint Agreement even after the DTE issued its arbitration order. The DTE first held that a final arbitration order pursuant to &#167; 252(b) is binding on both parties,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> noting that it had always required that arbitration be binding on both parties. It held that its rule that arbitrations be binding on both parties was consistent with FCC regulation. <i>See</i> 47 C.F.R. &#167; 51.807(h). Further, the DTE noted that the FCC's Local Competition Order, which embodies the FCC's initial post-enactment interpretation of the statute, stated that the states may consider the FCC's rules when implementing their own standards for arbitration. <i>See</i> Local Competition Order, 11 F.C.C.R. 15499, 16127, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">452885</span></span> (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the DTE held that since the arbitration order directed the parties to file an agreement containing the arbitrated terms, and provided no alternatives, Global NAPs' attempt to opt into the Sprint agreement was in violation of that earlier order. The DTE held that \"[t]he &#167; 252(i) adoption process permits a CLEC, during the negotiation process, to opt into another carrier's contract, not to do so after a decision has been reached through arbitration.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It also noted that Global NAPs' interpretation of the TCA was contrary to public policy, as it would allow carriers to \"game the system\" by always attempting to arbitrate, and if unhappy with the results, merely to opt into an existing agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The DTE ordered the parties to file an agreement consistent with the initial arbitration order within seven days. The parties signed and entered an agreement consistent with the court's ruling, under Global NAPs' protest. The DTE did not, contrary to Global NAPs' assertion, hold that a party to an arbitrated agreement can never exercise rights under &#167; 252(i). It also did not, contrary to Verizon's assertion, hold that a party subject to a valid arbitration order could never, under &#167; 252(i), take advantage of terms in a previously available agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 6, 2003, Global NAPs filed a second action in district court, this time challenging the DTE's February 19 order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 11, 2003, all parties to the second litigation (Global NAPs, Verizon, and the DTE) filed a joint motion to consolidate Global NAPs' two actions.

The district court granted the motion and accepted the parties' briefing schedule, under which the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment in the first action on the issue whether &#167; 252(i) would permit Global NAPs to opt into the Sprint agreement despite the existence of the DTE's arbitration order to the contrary.

This argument is without merit. The disposition of one case in a consolidated action is a final and appealable judgment unless the cases were consolidated \"for all purposes.\" <i>See Bay State HMO Management, Inc. v.

In moving to consolidate these cases, the parties expressly requested that the district court review the February 12, 2003 DTE order before proceeding with its review of the December 12, 2002 order, and the district court agreed to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Review of the merits of the December 12, 2002 arbitration order was, in essence, stayed pending the court's determination of the challenge to the second DTE order; the parties proposed completely separate briefing schedules for the review of the two consolidated cases.

There, this court determined that the claims in a consolidated action remained separate, and therefore a Rule 54(b) determination was not required for appellate jurisdiction to be proper, because \"[e]xcept for the consolidation of the[ ] cases for the convenience of pre-trial and trial procedure, the cases maintained their separate identities throughout the litigation. Separate judgments were entered in each of the five cases.\" <i>Id.</i> at 441. We found this to be consistent with the theory behind consolidation, which was a procedural mechanism meant to serve the purposes of judicial economy and convenience of the parties, as here, but not to alter the substantial rights the parties had in the separate actions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verizon relies on a notation in the district court docket from the clerk of court that the second complaint, i.e. the present case, was consolidated \"for all future proceedings,\" and that this removes it from the <i>Massachusetts Helicopter</i> rule. <i>See Bay State HMO Management, Inc., v.

The advantage, it says, of the Ninth Circuit rule is that it provides a bright line &#8212; no ruling in a consolidated case may be appealed until there is an ultimate final judgment on all matters. That is true. The disadvantage of the rule is that it may cause injustice on particular facts, and the rule acts as a disincentive which may prevent consolidation for purely pragmatic reasons of convenience and efficiency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, our adherence to the <i>Massachusetts Helicopter</i> rule was reaffirmed more recently in <i>Bay State HMO Management,</i> 181 F.3d at 178 n. 3.

Verizon's claim of lack of standing seems to be predicated on the notion that, if Global NAPs is allowed to opt into the Sprint agreement, the DTE will construe the Sprint agreement in a manner consistent with the terms of the arbitration order, and thus Global NAPs will be no better off.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs disagrees, and recites injury to itself. Further, Verizon's position is contrary to its position below in several respects. Among them is that Verizon requested from the DTE that, should the DTE allow Global NAPs to adopt the Sprint agreement, then the agreement be modified to adopt legal and policy determinations made in the arbitration order. If the Sprint agreement were not materially different from the challenged agreement, such modification would not be necessary. Indeed, Global NAPs would not be trying to join the Sprint agreement. Further, the possibility that the DTE <i>might</i> construe the Sprint agreement consistently with the December 12 arbitration order, and that doing so would be upheld against a likely challenge, is insufficient to render Global NAPs without standing in this case. We reject the lack of standing argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Interpretation of the TCA &#167; 252(i)</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precise legal question under review is narrow, though one of first impression in the circuit courts of appeals: does a competing carrier have an unconditional right, under &#167; 252(i) of the TCA, to avoid the terms of a final arbitration order from a state telecommunications commission, adjudicating a dispute between the CLEC and ILEC, by seeking to opt into the terms of a previous interconnection agreement that the ILEC has with another CLEC? This is an issue of federal statutory interpretation of the TCA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> We agree with the DTE and the district court that the TCA grants no such right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Standard of Review</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has not previously articulated precisely the standard of judicial review of state agency determinations under the TCA.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span> (2004). Section 252(i) states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A local exchange carrier shall make available any interconnection, service, or network element provided under an agreement approved under this section to which it is a party to any other requesting telecommunications carrier upon the same terms and conditions as those provided in the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">47 U.S.C. &#167; 252(i). In urging the court to hold that &#167; 252(i) gives it an unconditional right to avoid the terms of an arbitration order and opt into a previously available agreement, Global NAPs points out that the text of &#167; 252(i) does not state expressly when and under what circumstances the incumbent must make interconnection agreements available to other competitors. From this silence, Global NAPs argues it is free to opt in at any time it chooses. But &#167; 252(i) does not expressly state what Global NAPs reads it to mean either. At best, &#167; 252(i) is ambiguous on the subject, if that section is read alone. The absence of an express statement in &#167; 252(i) does not end the matter; the section must be read in light of the structure and intent of the statute. Global NAPs' broad reading of &#167; 252(i) is incorrect, because that reading brings &#167; 252(i), under the circumstances of this case, into direct conflict with, and in important aspects negates, several other sections of the TCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs' reading is inconsistent with the basic arbitral power vested in the state commission. Section 252(b), entitled \"Agreements arrived at through compulsory arbitration,\" allows for either party to an interconnection agreement to petition a state commission for arbitration of open issues, and grants powers to the state commission to carry out the arbitration. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs' reading is also inconsistent with the power of state commissions to make their arbitral decisions <i>binding on both parties.</i> Section 252(b)(4)(C) requires the state commission to \"resolve each issue set forth in the petition and the response, if any, by imposing appropriate conditions as required to implement subsection (c) of this section upon the parties to the agreement.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(b)(4)(C). In turn, subsection (c), among other things, states that \"a State commission shall ... provide a schedule for implementation of the terms and conditions by the parties to the agreement.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(c). By allowing the commission acting as arbitrator to place conditions on <i>both</i> parties for the implementation of interconnection agreements, it is clear that &#167; 252(b)(4)(C) intends for arbitration orders to be binding on both parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs responds that arbitration orders are not binding because generally under the TCA, the obligations on CLECs are not equal to or reciprocal with those on ILECs and so arbitration decisions are equally asymmetrical in their results. Global NAPs also makes a broader argument that the FCC's regulations, and the TCA generally, create asymmetrical rights and obligations on competitors and incumbents, and those greatly tip the scale in favor of competitors. It argues that under &#167; 252 incumbents are required to enter into interconnection agreements, but competitors are not. Thus Global NAPs argues that, to the extent there is ambiguity as to the scope of &#167; 252(i), it should be construed broadly in favor of competitors and against the incumbent, consistent with the asymmetry created by the statute and regulations as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument, however, ignores the important fact that &#167; 252(b) is <i>not</i> one of the areas of the TCA that creates asymmetrical obligations on the parties. Section 252(b)(1) allows either party to the negotiation to petition for arbitration. Section 252(b)(4) allows the state commission to impose conditions on both parties in order to carry out the arbitration. And &#167; 252(b)(5) creates a duty for both parties to cooperate with the arbitration at the risk of breaching the duty both parties have, under &#167; 252(a), to negotiate in good faith. There is no basis for Global NAPs' reading &#167; 252(i) as somehow turning the parallel obligations that run throughout &#167; 252(b) into merely one-way obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Global NAPs' reading is in conflict with the statutory duties of good faith and cooperation with the commission as arbitrator. The TCA, at &#167; 252(b)(5), states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The refusal of any other party to the negotiation to participate further in the negotiations, to cooperate with the State commission in carrying out its function as an arbitrator, or to continue to negotiate in good faith in the presence, or with the assistance, of the State commission shall be considered a failure to negotiate in good faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(b)(5). In attempting to void the terms of a valid arbitration order, it is clear that Global NAPs is refusing to cooperate with the DTE, in violation of its duty to negotiate in good faith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs responds by asking the court to read an implicit limitation on the good faith requirement of &#167; 252(b)(5) &#8212; that CLECs are not bound by the terms of &#167; 252(b)(5) if they attempt to opt into a previously available contract. Global NAPs says that this is the effect of &#167; 252(i). But &#167; 252(i) says nothing of the sort. Rather, it is written in terms of an obligation on the part of ILECs to make agreements available to potential CLECs, not as an unconditional right on the part of CLECs to modify their clear obligations under earlier subsections of &#167; 252. We read the sections consistently, and conclude that &#167; 252(i) is not an implicit limit on the binding effect of the arbitration provisions of &#167; 252(b)(5). In this context, there is nothing ambiguous about the terms of &#167; 252(b)(4)(C) and (b)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs' argument is also inconsistent with the judicial review provisions in the TCA, for determinations made by a state commission:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any case in which a State commission makes a determination under this section, any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section 251 of this title and this section.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">47 U.S.C. &#167; 252(e)(6). If \"any party aggrieved by a determination\" feels the arbitral determination is contrary to the TCA, its remedy is through judicial review, not self-help.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to our reading of the statutory sections, there is another source of law to consider: FCC regulations interpreting the statutory sections at issue, albeit on different points. The FCC's interpretation is relevant in two senses. First, under &#167; 252(c)(1), the DTE itself must \"ensure that such resolution and conditions meet the requirements of section 251 of this title, including the regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section 251.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 252(c)(1). Second, to the extent there is ambiguity in the statute, present here in &#167; 252(i) but not in &#167; 252(b)(4)(C) and (b)(5), deference is due to the FCC's reasonable interpretation. <i>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.

That is not surprising, since the issue is one of the power of a state commission. The TCA is an interwoven whole and the FCC's interpretation of related strands of the weaving is relevant, at least by analogy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both sides cite to the FCC's regulation interpreting &#167; 252(i), found at 47 C.F.R. &#167; 51.809, in support of their interpretation of the statute. The regulation, 47 C.F.R. &#167; 51.809(b), provides two express limitations to a CLEC's opt in rights under &#167; 252(i): an incumbent need not make available the terms of an interconnection agreement to a particular competitor 1) if it shows that the costs of providing a service will be greater to the requesting competitor than it was to the original negotiating party, or 2) if it shows that the provision of that service is technically infeasible. 47 C.F.R. &#167; 51.809(b). In addition, there is a third limitation: 47 C.F.R. &#167; 51.809(c) states that incumbents must make terms of interconnection agreements available to other competitors only \"for a reasonable time\" after their approval by the state commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FCC regulation 47 C.F.R. &#167; 51.809 itself rejects Global NAPs' premise that &#167; 252(i) grants an unconditional right to CLECs to adopt the terms of any interconnection agreement the ILEC has with another CLEC. The obligation of ILECs to make those agreements available to other CLECs is itself subject to conditions: comparable-cost, technical-feasibility, and the reasonable-time restrictions are three such conditions contemplated by the regulation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasonable-time requirement under 47 C.F.R. &#167; 51.809(c) is particularly relevant. Here, after all, the DTE has said it might have reached a different outcome if, during the pendency of an arbitration, Global NAPs had sought to withdraw its request for arbitration in favor of exercising whatever opt in rights it had. The DTE held only that once it had concluded its arbitration and issued its order, Global NAPs was not free to enter into an opt in agreement in lieu of accepting arbitrated terms and incorporating them into its agreement. The DTE's position is entirely consistent with the FCC regulation's reasonable-time requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also consider the parties' arguments based on the FCC's Local Competition Order, which embodies the FCC's initial interpretative rulemaking implementing the TCA after its passage in 1996, as support for its interpretation of the statute. <i>See</i> 11 F.C.C.R. 15499 (1996). Global NAPs attempts to argue that while FCC arbitrations are binding on both parties, 47 C.F.R. &#167; 51.807(h), the Local Competition Order demonstrates that arbitrations before state agencies under &#167; 252(b) are only binding on incumbents. It makes a sort of negative pregnant argument from the FCC's Local Competition Order &#182; 1293, which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent mutual agreement to different terms, the decision reached through arbitration is binding. We conclude that it would be inconsistent with the 1996 Act to ... permit incumbent LECs to not be bound by an arbitrated determination. We also believe that, although competing carriers do not have an affirmative duty to enter into agreements under section 252, a requesting carrier might face penalties if, by refusing to enter into an arbitrated agreement, that carrier is deemed to have failed to negotiate in good faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 F.C.C.R. at 16131, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">452885</span></span>. Global NAPs contends that this renders the arbitration provision a one-way ratchet: incumbents are bound by the arbitration decision, but competitors are not. We disagree. The Order does not say that competitors are not required to accept the terms of an arbitration order. Rather it says that competitors are not required \"to enter into agreements under section 252,\" and this is clearly correct. The law mandates that an incumbent must enter into an interconnection agreement under the requisite conditions, and the competitor need not enter into an agreement even if the incumbent so desires. It says nothing about the obligations of a competitor that is subject to the terms of a binding arbitration order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, the Local Competition Order does not state that competitors have a right to use &#167; 251(i) to avoid their obligations under a binding arbitration order. Properly read the Order refers to the admitted binding effect in FCC arbitrations, but says nothing about state arbitrations. Further, the FCC regulation's explicit statement of the binding effect on both parties supports the DTE's position. <i>See</i> 47 C.F.R. &#167; 51.807(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs then makes another argument based on lack of symmetry as to most favored nation clauses. Global NAPs cites to Local Competition Order &#182; 1316, as well as the Tenth Circuit's decision in <i>U.S. West Communications, Inc. v. Sprint Communications Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"161866\"><a href=\"/opinion/161866/us-west-v-hix/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1241</span></a></span> (10th Cir.2002), to support its interpretation of &#167; 252(i). Neither is helpful to Global NAPs' position. Paragraph 1316 of the Local Competition Order states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We further conclude that section 252(i) entitles all parties with interconnection agreements to \"most favored nation\" status regardless of whether they include \"most favored nation\" clauses in their agreements. Congress's command under section 252(i)... means that any requesting carrier may avail itself of more advantageous terms and conditions <i>subsequently</i> negotiated by any other carrier for the same individual interconnection, service, or element once the subsequent agreement is filed with, and approved by, the state commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 F.C.C.R. at 16139-40, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">452885</span></span> (emphasis added). Paragraph 1316's \"most favored nation\" language deals with an issue not presented here: the ability of a party to an existing interconnection agreement to adopt the terms of another carrier's agreement that is <i>subsequently</i> approved by a state commission. The DTE's decision said nothing about Global NAPs' &#167; 252(i) rights to adopt terms in subsequently approved agreements, nor does our decision here do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs' reliance on <i>U.S. West</i> suffers from a similar problem. The question that court faced was whether the state commission acting as arbitrator properly interpreted &#167; 252(i) to allow a competitor to amend its interconnection agreement to take advantage of an incumbent's tariffs, as opposed merely to an element in another competitors' approved interconnection agreement, that are more favorable than the prices in its agreement. <i>U.S. West,</i> 275 F.3d at 1249. The case did not say that a CLEC subject to a binding arbitration order can use &#167; 252(i) to avoid the terms of that order and adopt completely the terms of a previously available agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs makes a final, policy-based argument that reading &#167; 252(i) to prevent it from opting into the Sprint agreement post-arbitration is both anti-competitive and discriminatory, and thus at odds with the purpose of the TCA.

Rather, the DTE held that a fuller reading of the TCA and FCC rules shows that this paragraph stood for the narrower proposition that competing carriers, unlike incumbents, cannot be forced to enter into an interconnection agreement, but rather can purchase services directly through the incumbent's tariff.
