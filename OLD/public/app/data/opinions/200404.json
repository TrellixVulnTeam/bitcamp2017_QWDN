In 1993, there was a tragic\n\nconstruction accident caused by a collapsing mast climber --\n\nmechanized scaffolding equipment with a mobile work platform that\n\ncan hydraulically ascend a mast -- leaving one man dead and another\n\nwith a life of pain and paralysis.               The families were paid\n\napproximately    $8   million;    the    money   came   from   Restoration\n\nPreservation Machinery, Inc. (\"RPM\") and Dunlop Equipment Co., Inc.\n\n(\"Dunlop\").     These two companies, the plaintiffs-appellees here,\n\nthen sought in two 1996 state court actions to recover the money on\n\ntheories   of   indemnification    or    contribution   from   five   other\n\ncompanies, defendants-appellants here, in the complicated chain of\n\nsale of the defective mast climber: Grove Europe, Ltd., Grove\n\nWorldwide Co., Inc., Bronto Skylift (\"Bronto\"), BET, PLC, and PTP,\n\nLtd.   Two additional defendants were added in 2000: Federal Signal\n\nCorp. (\"Federal USA\") and its subsidiary Federal Signal Corp.\n\n(Finland) Oy Ab (\"Federal Finland\").       Asserting in 2000 that these\n\nclaims had to be arbitrated, the defendants removed the case to\n\nfederal court and sought to compel arbitration pursuant to the\n\nConvention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral\n\nAwards, 9 U.S.C. ยง 205 (2000).          The district court remanded and\n\nthen denied the motion to compel arbitration as moot.           We affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n           On September 2, 1993, Charles MacGlashing and another\n\nbrick mason, James Proctor, both employees of RPM, were working on\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fa renovation project at the Longwood Towers complex in Brookline,\n\nMassachusetts.      MacGlashing and Proctor were removing stone from\n\nthe parapet of one of the towers when the mast climber they were\n\nusing collapsed.        Both men fell eight stories to the ground.\n\nProctor died; MacGlashing survived, but suffered serious injuries\n\nincluding    broken    bones,   internal    and    neurological     damage,   a\n\nruptured aorta and bladder, a perforated colon, and lung damage.\n\nMacGlashing was hospitalized for six months after the accident, and\n\nleft partially paralyzed and in constant pain.\n\n            MacGlashing and his wife filed suit against Dunlop in\n\nfederal court.      Dunlop filed a third-party complaint against RPM,\n\nseeking indemnification pursuant to their lease agreement.                 The\n\ncourt granted summary judgment to the MacGlashings and Dunlop on\n\nDunlop's third-party indemnification claim.                As a result of a\n\ncombined settlement with Dunlop and a verdict against RPM, the\n\nMacGlashings collected approximately $5.7 million dollars from\n\nDunlop and RPM.       RPM appealed the summary judgment ruling, but it\n\nwas affirmed.      MacGlashing v. Dunlop Equip. Co., 89 F.3d 932, 941\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            MacGlashing's ex-wife also filed suit against Dunlop, on\n\nbehalf of MacGlashing's minor children, in state court.             Proctor's\n\nfamily filed suit against Dunlop in state court as well.              In both\n\nof   the   state   court   actions,   Dunlop      also   entered   third-party\n\nindemnification complaints against RPM.           In each, summary judgment\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fwas entered in Dunlop's favor on the indemnity claims against RPM.\n\nIn the MacGlashing state action, MacGlashing's children and Dunlop\n\nreceived a judgment of $145,000 against RPM.   In the Proctor state\n\naction, Dunlop and Proctor's heirs received a judgment of $2\n\nmillion against RPM.   In total, RPM paid over $7 million dollars.\n\nDunlop paid approximately $1 million.      Dunlop and RPM now seek\n\nindemnification or contribution from other companies in the chain\n\nof sale of the defective mast climber.\n\n          This chain dates back to 1993, when Bronto sold a number\n\nof new aerial lifts to a joint venture comprised of BET and PTP.\n\nAs part of the purchase price, Bronto took in trade sixty used mast\n\nclimbers from BET and PTP.      At the same time, Grove Europe also\n\nsold aerial lifts to BET and PTP, receiving in trade sixty-two used\n\nmast climbers.    (The mast climbers were manufactured by still\n\nanother company, Access Engineering.) Grove Europe and Bronto then\n\nsold the used mast climbers to Dunlop.     That sale took place on\n\nAugust 2, 1993.   The bill of sale, which was signed by Bronto,\n\nGrove Europe and Dunlop, contains an arbitration clause:\n\n          The construction,     validity and performance of any\n          contract shall be      governed by the laws of England\n          (including English    conflict of laws) and all disputes\n          which arise out of    or in connection with any contract\n          shall be settled by   arbitration in England in accordance\n          with provisions of     the Arbitration Acts for the time\n          being in force.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fDunlop took delivery of the mast climbers from BET and PTP depots.\n\nIt then leased four mast climbers to RPM on July 7, 1993.                   The\n\naccident took place two months later.\n\n            Following the judgments in suits brought by the families\n\nof MacGlashing and Proctor, Dunlop and Restoration sought recovery\n\nfrom Bronto, Grove Europe, Grove Worldwide, BET, and PTP.                 Grove\n\nWorldwide is a U.S. company; its relation to Grove Europe, a\n\nBritish company, is not specified in the record.             In August 1996,\n\nDunlop filed suit in Suffolk Superior Court against Bronto, Grove\n\nEurope, BET, and PTP.       The following month, RPM filed a similar\n\nsuit in Middlesex Superior Court against Grove Europe, Grove\n\nWorldwide, and Bronto, for indemnification and contribution, and\n\nlater   amended    the   complaint   to    include   negligence,       negligent\n\nfailure to warn, and breach of warranties. Grove Europe and Bronto\n\nresponded   by    filing   motions   to    dismiss   for   lack   of   personal\n\njurisdiction.     Grove Worldwide answered the complaint in June 1997\n\nand asserted as one of its affirmative defenses that the parties\n\nwere bound to submit the matter to arbitration.              But it did not\n\nmove to compel arbitration.      RPM subsequently amended its claim to\n\nadd BET and PTP as defendants.             BET and PTP filed motions to\n\ndismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.           None of the motions to\n\ndismiss were granted.      These two state court suits were ultimately\n\nconsolidated in July 2000.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f           The parties engaged in discovery from 1997 through 2000.\n\nFive people were deposed, including two depositions in London. RPM\n\nand Dunlop exchanged requests for production of documents and\n\ninterrogatories    with     defendants    other   than     Grove    Worldwide.\n\nExperts   were    retained    to   conduct     failure     analyses       on   the\n\nscaffolding equipment.       Thirteen status conferences were held in\n\nthe Middlesex Court litigation.          During the course of discovery,\n\nplaintiffs learned that on August 4, 1995 Federal Finland had\n\npurchased the assets and liabilities of Bronto.\n\n           Federal USA, the sole shareholder of Federal Finland,\n\njoined the asset purchase contract as a guarantor.                      Under the\n\ncontract, Federal Finland purchased all assets of Bronto, including\n\nBronto's proprietary information, records, trade rights, and causes\n\nof   actions.     Federal    Finland   also    assumed    many     of    Bronto's\n\nliabilities.      Product    liability    on   items     sold   prior     to   the\n\neffective date of the transfer was excluded, except for claims\n\n\"arising under contract or warranty.\"1         The asset purchase contract\n\nlimited assignment of assumed contracts only where consent was\n\nrequired and where the assignment itself constituted a breach of\n\nthe pre-existing contract.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n        Plaintiffs contend that this restriction does not include\nthe mast climbers at issue, because the asset sale contract\nspecifies products \"manufactured, sold and delivered\" prior to the\neffective date. (emphasis added)     The mast climbers were not\nmanufactured by Bronto.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f           In December 1999, RPM amended its complaint to add\n\nFederal USA, and in March 2000 further amended it to add Federal\n\nFinland, as necessary defendants.          On June 12, 2000, Dunlop filed\n\nan amended complaint adding Federal USA and Federal Finland as\n\ndefendants.   Federal USA responded to RPM's amended complaint by\n\nfiling a motion to dismiss in March 2000, asserting that Federal\n\nFinland was the party that had purchased Bronto's assets.            Federal\n\nUSA then sought to withdraw its motion to dismiss in April 2000 so\n\nthat it could file for summary judgment.               In May 2000, both\n\nFederals   filed   a   notice   of   removal   in   state   court   based   on\n\ndiversity jurisdiction. However, they never filed the notice of\n\nremoval in U.S. district court and shortly thereafter abandoned\n\nthis effort to remove the case. Meanwhile, neither of the Federals\n\nconducted any discovery.\n\n           A trial date of September 18, 2000 had been scheduled.\n\nIn June 2000, Federal USA moved to reset the tracking order to\n\nallow for a motion for summary judgment.             At an August 2, 2000\n\nstatus conference, all defendants filed a notice of removal to\n\nfederal court, citing their intention to exercise their arbitration\n\nrights.    On August 14, 2000, the plaintiffs filed a motion to\n\nremand the case to state court.             Two weeks later, before the\n\ndistrict court acted, the defendants filed a motion to compel\n\narbitration and to stay the district court proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f          On February 22, 2001, the district court allowed the\n\nmotion to remand to Middlesex Superior Court, citing this court's\n\ndecision in Menorah Insurance Co. v. INX Reinsurance Corp., 72 F.3d\n\n218 (1st Cir. 1995), and denied the defendants' motion to compel\n\narbitration as moot.   No further reasons were given.      Defendants\n\nappeal the district court's ruling, arguing that the jurisdictional\n\nruling was in error, and that there had been no waiver supporting\n\nthe district court's ruling against compelling arbitration.\n\n                                  II.\n\n          Plaintiffs argue that we lack jurisdiction to examine the\n\nremand order because it was based on a determination of the\n\ndistrict court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction over the\n\nremoved case.    28 U.S.C. ยง 1447(d) mandates that \"[a]n order\n\nremanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is\n\nnot reviewable on appeal or otherwise . . . .\"        Section 1447(d)\n\napplies where the district court finds that it lacks subject matter\n\njurisdiction.   The district court's opinion here is notably terse;\n\nwe conclude from the citation to Menorah that the court reasoned\n\nthat subject matter jurisdiction was lacking because of a waiver of\n\nthe right to arbitrate by the defendants.    The parties agree that\n\nis what the district court meant by the citation to Menorah.\n\n          Plaintiffs   read   ยง   1447(d)   broadly   as   a   blanket\n\nprohibition blocking any sort of appellate review of decisions\n\nremanding arbitration cases that had been removed to federal court\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\funder 9 U.S.C. ยง 205 and subsequently remanded. See, e.g., Transit\n\nCas. Co. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London, 119 F.3d\n\n619, 625 (8th Cir. 1997) (remand order not reviewable on appeal).\n\nBut see Beiser v. Weyler, 284 F.3d 665, 672-74 (5th Cir. 2002)\n\n(asserting     appellate      jurisdiction,            criticizing       conflation       of\n\njurisdictional and merits inquiries in remanding arbitration cases\n\n\"into a single step,\" and arguing that the consequences of such a\n\nconflation     are    \"both   irrational         and    inconsistent       with   .   .    .\n\nprecedents\" because of the importance of international comity, the\n\ngoal   of   development       of   a   uniform     body       of   law   regarding    the\n\nConvention,     the    international         business         community's     need    for\n\npredictability, and the general federal policy of solicitude toward\n\narbitration).\n\n             In Menorah, we confronted a similar argument but declined\n\nto decide the jurisdictional issue, holding \"Since [plaintiff]\n\neasily wins an affirmance on the substantive issue of waiver, we\n\ndecline to decide the jurisdictional issues raised by it.\" 72 F.3d\n\nat 223 n.9 (citing Norton v. Mathews, 427 U.S. 524, 528-33 (1976)\n\n(where the merits can easily be resolved in favor of the party\n\nchallenging jurisdiction, resolution of complex jurisdictional\n\ninquiry may be avoided)).          We follow a similar course here.               As the\n\nplaintiffs concede, \"jurisdiction does not have to be resolved for\n\nthis   Court   to     enter   a    final    ruling       on   the   merits    that    the\n\ndefendants have no right to arbitrate.\"\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\f           The decision in Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better\n\nEnvironment, 523 U.S. 83 (1998), does not require that we reach the\n\njurisdictional question.          In Steel Co., the Court attacked the\n\npractice of so-called \"hypothetical jurisdiction,\" id. at 94, and\n\nconcluded that \"Article III jurisdiction is always an antecedent\n\nquestion,\" id. at 101.       The Supreme Court itself has made it clear\n\nthat Steel    Co. does      not    establish   an    unyielding    sequence   of\n\ndecision-making regardless of circumstances.               See Ruhrgas AG v.\n\nMarathon Oil Co., 526 U.S. 574, 578 (1999).             In Steel Co., Justice\n\nBreyer, concurring, noted with approval that \"[t]his Court has\n\npreviously made clear that courts may 'reserve difficult questions\n\nof . . . jurisdiction when the case could alternatively be resolved\n\non the merits in the favor of the same party.'\"                 523 U.S. at 111\n\n(quoting Norton, 427 U.S. at 532).\n\n           Steel Co. does not create an absolute rule against\n\nbypassing questions of a jurisdictional nature.                 See Parella v.\n\nRet. Bd. of the R.I. Employees' Ret. Sys., 173 F.3d 46, 53-54 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).      Parella noted that while Article III jurisdictional\n\ndisputes   are    subject    to    Steel   Co.,     statutory    jurisdictional\n\ndisputes are not.      Id.        This rule is well established in this\n\ncircuit. See Davignon v. Clemmey, Nos. 01-1862, 02-1293, 02-1346,\n\n2003 WL 721803, at *5 (1st Cir. Mar. 4, 2003) (holding that an\n\nappellate court remains free to bypass problematic jurisdictional\n\nissues provided those issues do not implicate Article III 'case' or\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f'controversy' requirement); United States v. Woods, 210 F.3d 70, 74\n\nn.2 (1st Cir. 1999) (following Parella and concluding that Steel\n\nCo. is limited to Article III subject matter jurisdiction issues);\n\nKelly v. Marcantorio, 187 F.3d 192, 197 (1st Cir. 2000) (same,\n\nemphasizing that courts should not reach constitutional issues in\n\nadvance of the necessity of deciding them); Cablevision of Boston,\n\nInc. v.

Mar. 14, 2003) (identifying another exception\n\nto Steel Co., consistent with Parella, where a court's prior case\n\nlaw \"foreordains\" the outcome on the merits so as to deny recovery,\n\na Steel Co. inquiry into jurisdiction is not required).                Other\n\ncircuits similarly have held that Steel Co. applies only to Article\n\nIII constitutional limitations on jurisdiction. See Fama v. Comm'r\n\nof Corr. Servs., 235 F.3d 804, 817 n.11 (2d Cir. 2000); Larsen v.\n\nSenate of Pa., 152 F.3d 240, 245 (3d Cir. 1998); Kauthar SDN BHD v.\n\nSternberg, 149 F.3d 659, 663 n.4 (7th Cir. 1998); see also Ctr. for\n\nReprod.

See Moses H. Cone Mem'l\n\nHosp. v. Mercury Constr.

Waiver By Grove Europe, Grove Worldwide, Bronto,\n                     PTP and BET\n\n              Applying the Jones Motor factors to the parties that were\n\ndefendants before 2000 (Grove Europe, Grove Worldwide, Bronto, PTP,\n\nand BET), the conduct of each constitutes an implied waiver.\n\n              There are no per se rules as to the length of delay\n\nnecessary to amount to waiver, see Menorah, 72 F.3d at 222 (citing\n\ncase in which thirteen months' delay was found insufficient to\n\nconstitute waiver).         Here, the four years' delay from filing in\n\nAugust 1996 to removal in August 2000, encompassing a period of\n\nactive    state     court   litigation,    greatly   exceeds   that   found\n\nacceptable in this circuit. See Creative Solutions, 252 F.3d at 33\n\n(delay of five months is not waiver); see also Navieros, 120 F.3d\n\n                                    -14-\n\fat   316   (one-month   delay      in   context       of   expedited   litigation\n\nsufficient to find waiver); Menorah, 72 F.3d at 222 (delay of more\n\nthan fifteen months sufficient); Jones Motor, 671 F.2d at 42 (delay\n\nof more than one year sufficient).\n\n            The length of delay must be evaluated in the context of\n\nlitigation activities engaged in during that time.                     See, e.g.,\n\nCreative Solutions, 252 F.3d at 33 (waiver not found when there was\n\nno discovery or other activity aside from plaintiff's filing a\n\nrequest for production); Jones Motor, 671 F.2d at 42 (waiver found\n\nwhen party seeking arbitration engaged in deposition-taking, a pre-\n\ntrial conference, cross-motions for summary judgment, and oral\n\nargument).     The defendants here were involved in at least five\n\ndepositions and thirteen pre-trial conferences.                  Prejudice to the\n\nplaintiffs is easily inferred from the necessary expenditures over\n\nthat period of time.         See Menorah, 72 F.3d at 222 (no error in\n\nfinding that litigation expenses over the course of a more than\n\nfifteen-month delay amounted to prejudice); see also Navieros, 120\n\nF.3d at 316 (prejudice found as a result of expenses related to\n\nlitigation    that   would   not    have       been   incurred    in   arbitration\n\nproceedings).\n\n             Furthermore, the context of these defendants' belated\n\nassertion of their right to arbitrate also points to waiver.\n\nRemoval to federal court to compel arbitration occurred in August\n\n2000, less than two months before the scheduled trial date.                  Jones\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fMotor directs attention to \"whether the enforcement of arbitration\n\nwas brought up when the trial was near at hand.\"          671 F.2d at 44;\n\nsee Navieros, 120 F.3d at 316 (moving for arbitration the day\n\nbefore trial considered as part of waiver analysis). Given a four-\n\nyear-long litigation, first raising arbitration less than two\n\nmonths before trial unquestionably constitutes invoking it \"when\n\nthe trial was near at hand.\"\n\n              Grove Worldwide stands in a slightly different posture.\n\nIt asserted arbitration as an affirmative defense in its June 1997\n\nanswer   to    the   Middlesex     complaint.    Grove   Worldwide    never\n\nparticipated in document discovery.         But it also never followed up\n\non its 1997 claim of arbitration and let the matter rest until\n\n2000.    The length of its delay results in the same prejudice to\n\nplaintiffs and so Grove Worldwide has also waived.\n\n              B.     Waiver By Federal USA and Federal Finland\n\n           Defendants Federal USA and Federal Finland argue that\n\nthey have not waived a right to arbitrate because the delay between\n\nthe time they were joined as defendants and the time they moved to\n\ncompel   arbitration    is   not   sufficient   to   establish   prejudice.\n\nFederal USA was not served until January 2000 and Federal Finland\n\nwas not joined as defendant by RPM until March 2000.                 Dunlop,\n\nmeanwhile, did not join either of the Federals as defendants until\n\nJune 2000.      Subsequently, neither of the Federals participated in\n\ndiscovery.\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f            We assume arguendo, in the Federals' favor, that they, as\n\nnon-signatories to the contract containing the arbitration clause,\n\nmay assert a claim to arbitration based on their relationship with\n\nBronto.2    Still, Bronto clearly waived its right to enforce the\n\narbitration clause,3 and the Federals are bound by that waiver\n\nbecause it occurred before the plaintiffs had notice of the asset\n\npurchase.    See Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 336(2) (1981)\n\n(\"The right of any assignee is subject to any defense or claim of\n\nthe obligor which accrues before the obligor receives notification\n\nof the assignment, but not to defenses or claims which accrue\n\nthereafter except as stated in this Section or as provided by\n\n\n     2\n        While it is generally true that \"a contract cannot bind a\nnonparty,\" Waffle House, 534 U.S. at 294, there are exceptions\nallowing non-signatories to compel arbitration. A non-signatory\nmay be bound by or acquire rights under an arbitration agreement\nunder ordinary state-law principles of agency or contract. See 1\nG.M. Wilner, Domke on Commercial Arbitration ยง 10:00, at 1-2 & 3\nn.5 (rev. ed. 2002).    A number of circuits have allowed a non-\nsignatory to compel arbitration under a limited equitable estoppel\ntheory. See Grigson v. Creative Artists Agency, 210 F.3d 524, 527\n(5th Cir. 2000); Sunkist Soft Drinks, Inc. v. Sunkist Growers,\nInc., 10 F.3d 753, 757 (11th Cir. 1993); Hughes Masonry Co. v.\nGreater Clark County Sch. Bldg. Corp., 659 F.2d 836, 841 n.9 (7th\nCir. 1981); see also Med. Air Tech. Corp. v. Marwan Inv., Inc., 303\nF.3d 11, 18-19 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting existence of equitable\nestoppel).\n     3\n       Bronto did not raise arbitration as an affirmative defense;\ninstead it filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal\njurisdiction in June 1998.     Bronto never raised its right to\narbitrate at any time before 2000. Moreover, Bronto participated\nin discovery, moving in September 1997 for more time to respond,\nand responding to RPM's request for document production in January\n1998.    Through this delay, participation in litigation, and\nresultant prejudice to plaintiffs, Bronto waived its right to\narbitrate before plaintiffs knew of the asset purchase.\n\n                                 -17-\n\fstatute.\") (emphasis added); cf. U.C.C. ยง 9-318(1)(b), 3A U.L.A.\n\n460 (1992) (rights of an assignee are subject to \"any other defense\n\nor claim of the account debtor against the assignor which accrues\n\nbefore       the    account    debtor     receives    notification     of     the\n\nassignment\"); In re Calore Express Co., 288 F.3d 22, 47 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (applying Massachusetts law and finding that timing of notice\n\nof assignment under ยง 9-318(1)(b) governs outcome).4\n\n               Nevertheless, the Federals argue that they are not bound\n\nby Bronto's actions because those actions occurred after the August\n\n1995       asset   purchase.    The     Federals   contend   their   rights   as\n\nassignees are measured at the time of the assignment, and so\n\nplaintiffs -- the obligors -- cannot raise a defense of waiver\n\nbased on Bronto's conduct.               But as said, basic contract law\n\nprinciples do not limit obligors to only those defenses that arose\n\nbefore the assignment.          Instead, the inquiry turns on when the\n\n\n\n       4\n        There is a lurking choice of law question. In diversity\ncases, we apply the forum state's choice of law rules. See Auto\nEurope, LLC v. Conn. Indem. Co., 321 F.3d 60, 64 (1st Cir. 2003).\nWe do not decide here whether Massachusetts would enforce the\ncontractual choice of law or its own law. The asset purchase\ncontract incorporates Finnish law. However, parties do not argue\nthat Finnish law governs the assignment, nor do they present\nrelevant Finnish law. Under Massachusetts law, \"we need not take\njudicial notice of the law of a foreign jurisdiction where, as\nhere, it is not brought to our attention by the record or the\nbriefs, and where, as here, counsel apparently tried the case on\nthe theory that the relevant [foreign] law was the same as our\nown.\" Tsacoyeanes v. Canadian Pac. Ry. Co., 162 N.E. 23, 24 (Mass.\n1959) (citations omitted).

As a result, the\n\nobligor can employ defenses that emerged subsequent to assignment:\n\n          The assignee takes what the assignor had 'warts and all,'\n          for an assignment does not deprive the obligor of any\n          defenses or claims arising out of the agreement that the\n          obligor could have asserted against the assignor absent\n          assignment. The obligor may assert these defenses and\n          claims against the assignee, regardless of whether the\n          assignee knew of their existence at the time of\n          assignment or whether they had even come into existence\n          at that time.\n\n3 E.A. Farnsworth, Farnsworth On Contracts ยง 11.8, at 106 (2d ed.\n\n1998)(emphasis      added).   In   short,   the   Federals   are   bound   by\n\nBronto's actions prior to the plaintiffs' 1999 discovery of the\n\nownership change.\n\n          For these reasons, the Federals do not have a right to\n\ncompel arbitration under the 1993 bill of sale.\n\n                                    IV.\n\n          The district court's rulings on the motion to remand and\n\ndenial   of   the    motion   to   compel   arbitration      are   affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\f",

The families were paid approximately $8 million; the money came from Restoration Preservation Machinery, Inc. (\"RPM\") and Dunlop Equipment Co., Inc. (\"Dunlop\"). These two companies, the plaintiffs-appellees here, then sought in two 1996 state court actions to recover the money on theories of indemnification or contribution from five other companies, defendants-appellants here, in the complicated chain of sale of the defective mast climber: Grove Europe, Ltd., Grove Worldwide Co., Inc., Bronto Skylift (\"Bronto\"), BET, PLC, and PTP, Ltd. Two additional defendants were added in 2000: Federal Signal Corp. (\"Federal USA\") and its subsidiary Federal Signal Corp. (Finland) Oy Ab (\"Federal Finland\"). Asserting in 2000 that these claims had to be arbitrated, the defendants removed the case to federal court and sought to compel arbitration pursuant to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 9 U.S.C. &#167; 205 (2000).

MacGlashing and Proctor were removing stone from the parapet of one of the towers when the mast climber they were using collapsed. Both men fell eight stories to the ground. Proctor died; MacGlashing survived, but suffered serious injuries including broken bones, internal and neurological damage, a ruptured aorta and bladder, a perforated colon, and lung damage. MacGlashing was hospitalized for six months after the accident, and left partially paralyzed and in constant pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MacGlashing and his wife filed suit against Dunlop in federal court. Dunlop filed a third-party complaint against RPM, seeking indemnification pursuant to their lease agreement. The court granted summary judgment to the MacGlashings and Dunlop on Dunlop's third-party indemnification claim. As a result of a combined settlement with Dunlop and a verdict against RPM, the MacGlashings collected approximately $5.7 million dollars from Dunlop and RPM. RPM appealed the summary judgment ruling, but it was affirmed. <i>MacGlashing v. Dunlop Equip.

Proctor's family filed suit against Dunlop in state court as well. In both of the state court actions, Dunlop also entered third-party indemnification complaints against RPM. In each, summary judgment was entered in Dunlop's favor on the indemnity claims against RPM. In the MacGlashing state action, MacGlashing's children and Dunlop received a judgment of $145,000 against RPM. In the Proctor state action, Dunlop and Proctor's heirs received a judgment of $2 million against RPM. In total, RPM paid over $7 million dollars. Dunlop paid approximately $1 million. Dunlop and RPM now seek indemnification or contribution from other companies in the chain of sale of the defective mast climber.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This chain dates back to 1993, when Bronto sold a number of new aerial lifts to a joint venture comprised of BET and PTP. As part of the purchase price, Bronto took in trade sixty used mast climbers from BET and PTP. At the same time, Grove Europe also sold aerial lifts to BET and PTP, receiving in trade sixty-two used mast climbers. (The mast climbers were manufactured by still another company, Access Engineering.) Grove Europe and Bronto then sold the used mast climbers to Dunlop. That sale took place on August 2, 1993. The bill of sale, which was signed by Bronto, Grove Europe and Dunlop, contains an arbitration clause:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The construction, validity and performance of any contract shall be governed by the laws of England (including English conflict of laws) and all disputes which arise out of or in connection with any contract shall be settled by arbitration in England in accordance with provisions of the Arbitration Acts for the time being in force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dunlop took delivery of the mast climbers from BET and PTP depots.

The accident took place two months later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the judgments in suits brought by the families of MacGlashing and Proctor, Dunlop and Restoration sought recovery from Bronto, Grove Europe, Grove Worldwide, BET, and PTP. Grove Worldwide is a U.S. company; its relation to Grove Europe, a British company, is not specified in the record. In August 1996, Dunlop filed suit in Suffolk Superior Court against Bronto, Grove Europe, BET, and PTP. The following month, RPM filed a similar suit in Middlesex Superior Court against Grove Europe, Grove Worldwide, and Bronto, for indemnification and contribution, and later amended the complaint to include negligence, negligent failure to warn, and breach of warranties. Grove Europe and Bronto responded by filing motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Grove Worldwide answered the complaint in June 1997 and asserted as one of its affirmative defenses that the parties were bound to submit the matter to arbitration. But it did not move to compel arbitration. RPM subsequently amended its claim to add BET and PTP as defendants. BET and PTP filed motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. None of the motions to dismiss were granted. These two state court suits were ultimately consolidated in July 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties engaged in discovery from 1997 through 2000. Five people were deposed, including two depositions in London. RPM and Dunlop exchanged requests for production of documents and interrogatories with defendants other than Grove Worldwide. Experts were retained to conduct failure analyses on the scaffolding equipment. Thirteen status conferences were held in the Middlesex Court litigation.

Under the contract, Federal Finland purchased all assets of Bronto, including Bronto's proprietary information, records, trade rights, and causes of actions. Federal Finland also assumed many of Bronto's liabilities. Product liability on items sold prior to the effective date of the transfer was excluded, except for claims \"arising under contract or warranty.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The asset purchase contract limited assignment of assumed contracts only where consent was required and where the assignment itself constituted a breach of the pre-existing contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1999, RPM amended its complaint to add Federal USA, and in March 2000 further amended it to add Federal Finland, as necessary defendants. On June 12, 2000, Dunlop filed an amended complaint adding Federal USA and Federal Finland as defendants. Federal USA responded to RPM's amended complaint by filing a motion to dismiss in March 2000, asserting that Federal Finland was the party that had purchased Bronto's assets. Federal USA then sought to withdraw its motion to dismiss in April 2000 so that it could file for summary judgment. In May 2000, both Federals filed a notice of removal in state court based on diversity jurisdiction.

On August 14, 2000, the plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case to state court.

The district court's opinion here is notably terse; we conclude from the citation to <i>Menorah</i> that the court reasoned that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking because of a waiver of the right to arbitrate by the defendants.

The families were paid approximately $8 million; the money came from Restoration Preservation Machinery, Inc. (\"RPM\") and Dunlop Equipment Co., Inc. (\"Dunlop\"). These two companies, the plaintiffs-appellees here, then sought in two 1996 state court actions to recover the money on theories of indemnification or contribution from five other companies, defendants-appellants here, in the complicated chain of sale of the defective mast climber: Grove Europe, Ltd., Grove Worldwide Co., Inc., Bronto Skylift (\"Bronto\"), BET, PLC, and PTP, Ltd. Two additional defendants were added in 2000: Federal Signal Corp. (\"Federal USA\") and its subsidiary Federal Signal Corp. (Finland) Oy Ab (\"Federal Finland\"). Asserting in 2000 that these claims had to be arbitrated, the defendants removed the case to federal court and sought to compel arbitration pursuant to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 9 U.S.C. &#167; 205 (2000). The district court remanded and then denied the motion to compel arbitration as moot. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 2, 1993, Charles MacGlashing and another brick mason, James Proctor, both employees of RPM, were working on a renovation project at the Longwood Towers complex in Brookline, Massachusetts. MacGlashing and Proctor were removing stone from the parapet of one of the towers when the mast climber they were using collapsed. Both men fell eight stories to the ground. Proctor died; MacGlashing survived, but suffered serious injuries including broken bones, internal and neurological damage, a ruptured aorta and bladder, a perforated colon, and lung damage. MacGlashing was hospitalized for six months after the accident, and left partially paralyzed and in constant pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MacGlashing and his wife filed suit against Dunlop in federal court. Dunlop filed a third-party complaint against RPM, seeking indemnification pursuant to their lease agreement. The court granted summary judgment to the MacGlashings and Dunlop on Dunlop's third-party indemnification claim. As a result of a combined settlement with Dunlop and a verdict against RPM, the MacGlashings collected approximately $5.7 million dollars from Dunlop and RPM. RPM appealed the summary judgment ruling, but it was affirmed. <i>MacGlashing v. Dunlop Equip. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196891\"><a href=\"/opinion/196891/macglashing-v-restoration/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span>, 941 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MacGlashing's ex-wife also filed suit against Dunlop, on behalf of MacGlashing's minor children, in state court. Proctor's family filed suit against Dunlop in state court as well. In both of the state court actions, Dunlop also entered third-party indemnification complaints against RPM. In each, summary judgment was entered in Dunlop's favor on the indemnity claims against RPM. In the MacGlashing state action, MacGlashing's children and Dunlop received a judgment of $145,000 against RPM. In the Proctor state action, Dunlop and Proctor's heirs received a judgment of $2 million against RPM. In total, RPM paid over $7 million dollars. Dunlop paid approximately $1 million. Dunlop and RPM now seek indemnification or contribution from other companies in the chain of sale of the defective mast climber.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This chain dates back to 1993, when Bronto sold a number of new aerial lifts to a joint venture comprised of BET and PTP. As part of the purchase price, Bronto took in trade sixty used mast climbers from BET and PTP. At the same time, Grove Europe also sold aerial lifts to BET and PTP, receiving in trade sixty-two used mast climbers. (The mast climbers were manufactured by still another company, Access Engineering.) Grove Europe and Bronto then sold the used mast climbers to Dunlop. That sale took place on August 2, 1993. The bill of sale, which was signed by Bronto, Grove Europe and Dunlop, contains an arbitration clause:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The construction, validity and performance of any contract shall be governed by the laws of England (including English conflict of laws) and all disputes which arise out of or in connection with any contract shall be settled by arbitration in England in accordance with provisions of the Arbitration Acts for the time being in force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dunlop took delivery of the mast climbers from BET and PTP depots. It then leased four mast climbers to RPM on July 7, 1993. The accident took place two months later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the judgments in suits brought by the families of MacGlashing and Proctor, Dunlop and Restoration sought recovery from Bronto, Grove Europe, Grove Worldwide, BET, and PTP. Grove Worldwide is a U.S. company; its relation to Grove Europe, a British company, is not specified in the record. In August 1996, Dunlop filed suit in Suffolk Superior Court against Bronto, Grove Europe, BET, and PTP. The following month, RPM filed a similar suit in Middlesex Superior Court against Grove Europe, Grove Worldwide, and Bronto, for indemnification and contribution, and later amended the complaint to include negligence, negligent failure to warn, and breach of warranties. Grove Europe and Bronto responded by filing motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Grove Worldwide answered the complaint in June 1997 and asserted as one of its affirmative defenses that the parties were bound to submit the matter to arbitration. But it did not move to compel arbitration. RPM subsequently amended its claim to add BET and PTP as defendants. BET and PTP filed motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. None of the motions to dismiss were granted. These two state court suits were ultimately consolidated in July 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties engaged in discovery from 1997 through 2000. Five people were deposed, including two depositions in London. RPM and Dunlop exchanged requests for production of documents and interrogatories with defendants other than Grove Worldwide. Experts were retained to conduct failure analyses on the scaffolding equipment. Thirteen status conferences were held in the Middlesex Court litigation. During the course of discovery, plaintiffs learned that on August 4, 1995 Federal Finland had purchased the assets and liabilities of Bronto.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal USA, the sole shareholder of Federal Finland, joined the asset purchase contract as a guarantor. Under the contract, Federal Finland purchased all assets of Bronto, including Bronto's proprietary information, records, trade rights, and causes of actions. Federal Finland also assumed many of Bronto's liabilities. Product liability on items sold prior to the effective date of the transfer was excluded, except for claims \"arising under contract or warranty.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The asset purchase contract limited assignment of assumed contracts only where consent was required and where the assignment itself constituted a breach of the pre-existing contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1999, RPM amended its complaint to add Federal USA, and in March 2000 further amended it to add Federal Finland, as necessary defendants. On June 12, 2000, Dunlop filed an amended complaint adding Federal USA and Federal Finland as defendants. Federal USA responded to RPM's amended complaint by filing a motion to dismiss in March 2000, asserting that Federal Finland was the party that had purchased Bronto's assets. Federal USA then sought to withdraw its motion to dismiss in April 2000 so that it could file for summary judgment. In May 2000, both Federals filed a notice of removal in state court based on diversity jurisdiction. However, they never filed the notice of removal in U.S. district court and shortly thereafter abandoned this effort to remove the case. Meanwhile, neither of the Federals conducted any discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A trial date of September 18, 2000 had been scheduled. In June 2000, Federal USA moved to reset the tracking order to allow for a motion for summary judgment. At an August 2, 2000 status conference, all defendants filed a notice of removal to federal court, citing their intention to exercise their arbitration rights. On August 14, 2000, the plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case to state court. Two weeks later, before the district court acted, the defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration and to stay the district court proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 22, 2001, the district court allowed the motion to remand to Middlesex Superior Court, citing this court's decision in <i>Menorah Insurance Co. v.

No further reasons were given. Defendants appeal the district court's ruling, arguing that the jurisdictional ruling was in error, and that there had been no waiver supporting the district court's ruling against compelling arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that we lack jurisdiction to examine the remand order because it was based on a determination of the district court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction over the removed case. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1447(d) mandates that \"[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise....\" Section 1447(d) applies where the district court finds that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction. The district court's opinion here is notably terse; we conclude from the citation to <i>Menorah</i> that the court reasoned that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking because of a waiver of the right to arbitrate by the defendants. The parties agree that is what the district court meant by the citation to <i>Menorah.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs read &#167; 1447(d) broadly as a blanket prohibition blocking any sort of appellate review of decisions remanding arbitration cases that had been removed to federal court under 9 U.S.C. &#167; 205 and subsequently remanded. <i>See, e.g., Transit Cas.

Other relevant factors are whether the defendants have invoked the jurisdiction of the court by filing a counterclaim without asking for a stay of the proceedings, ... whether important intervening steps (e.g., taking advantage of judicial discovery procedures not available in arbitration ...) had taken place, ... and whether the other party was affected, misled, or prejudiced by the delay ....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Jones Motor,</i> 671 F.2d at 44 (quoting <i>Reid Burton Constr., Inc. v.

Here, the four years' delay from filing in August 1996 to removal in August 2000, encompassing a period of active state court litigation, greatly exceeds that found acceptable in this circuit. <i>See Creative Solutions,</i> 252 F.3d at 33 (delay of five months is not waiver); <i>see also Navieros,</i> 120 F.3d at 316 (one-month delay in context of expedited litigation sufficient to find waiver); <i>Menorah,</i> 72 F.3d at 222 (delay of more than fifteen months sufficient); <i>Jones Motor,</i> 671 F.2d at 42 (delay of more than one year sufficient).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The length of delay must be evaluated in the context of litigation activities engaged in during that time. <i>See, e.g., Creative Solutions,</i> 252 F.3d at 33 (waiver not found when there was no discovery or other activity aside from plaintiff's filing a request for production); <i>Jones Motor,</i> 671 F.2d at 42 (waiver found when party seeking arbitration engaged in deposition-taking, a pre-trial conference, cross-motions for summary judgment, and oral argument). The defendants here were involved in at least five depositions and thirteen pre-trial conferences. Prejudice to the plaintiffs is easily inferred from the necessary expenditures over that period of time. <i>See Menorah,</i> 72 F.3d at 222 (no error in finding that litigation expenses over the course of a more than fifteen-month delay amounted to prejudice); <i>see also Navieros,</i> 120 F.3d at 316 (prejudice found as a result of expenses related to litigation that would not have been incurred in arbitration proceedings).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the context of these defendants' belated assertion of their right to arbitrate also points to waiver.

It asserted arbitration as an affirmative defense in its June 1997 answer to the Middlesex complaint. Grove Worldwide never participated in document discovery. But it also never followed up on its 1997 claim of arbitration and let the matter rest until 2000. The length of its delay results in the same prejudice to plaintiffs and so Grove Worldwide has also waived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Waiver By Federal USA and Federal Finland</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants Federal USA and Federal Finland argue that they have not waived a right to arbitrate because the delay between the time they were joined as defendants and the time they moved to compel arbitration is not sufficient to establish prejudice. Federal USA was not served until January 2000 and Federal Finland was not joined as defendant by RPM until March 2000. Dunlop, meanwhile, did not join either of the Federals as defendants until June 2000. Subsequently, neither of the Federals participated in discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume arguendo, in the Federals' favor, that they, as non-signatories to the contract containing the arbitration clause, may assert a claim to arbitration based on their relationship with Bronto.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Still, Bronto clearly waived its right to enforce the arbitration clause,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and the Federals are bound by that waiver because it occurred before the plaintiffs had notice of the asset purchase. <i>See</i> Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 336(2) (1981) (\"The right of any assignee is subject to any defense or claim of the obligor which accrues <i>before the obligor receives notification of the assignment,</i> but not to defenses or claims which accrue thereafter except as stated in this Section or as provided by statute.\") (emphasis added); <i>cf.</i> U.C.C. &#167; 9-318(1)(b), 3A U.L.A. 460 (1992) (rights of an assignee are subject to \"any other defense or claim of the account debtor against the assignor which accrues before the account debtor receives notification of the assignment\"); <i>In re Calore Express Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199934\"><a href=\"/opinion/199934/united-states-v-fleet-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.2002) (applying Massachusetts law and finding that timing of notice of assignment under &#167; 9-318(1)(b) governs outcome).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the Federals argue that they are not bound by Bronto's actions because those actions occurred after the August 1995 asset purchase. The Federals contend their rights as assignees are measured at the time of the assignment, and so plaintiffs &#8212; the obligors &#8212; cannot raise a defense of waiver based on Bronto's conduct. But as said, basic contract law principles do not limit obligors to only those defenses that arose before the assignment. Instead, the inquiry turns on when the obligor received notification of the assignment. As a result, the obligor can employ defenses that emerged subsequent to assignment:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The assignee takes what the assignor had `warts and all,' for an assignment does not deprive the obligor of any defenses or claims arising out of the agreement that the obligor could have asserted against the assignor absent assignment. The obligor may assert these defenses and claims against the assignee, regardless of whether the assignee knew of their existence at the time of assignment <i>or whether they had even come into existence at that time.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3 E.A.
