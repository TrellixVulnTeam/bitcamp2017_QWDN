AND ESTATE OF ISMAEL NIEVES-VALLE,\n\n                     Defendants, Appellants.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n      [Hon. Jaime Pieras, Jr., Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                 Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Arturo Luciano Delgado for appellants.\n     Celina Romany, with whom Juan M. Frontera and Celina Romany\nLaw Offices were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          July 9, 2004\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.          This appeal tells a cautionary\n\ntale of the risks run by parties who adopt a laissez-faire attitude\n\ntoward court-imposed deadlines.           The defendants in this case —\n\nAwning Windows, Inc. (AWI) and the Estate of Ismael Nieves-Valle\n\n(the Estate) — acted in that fashion.           The district court, after\n\npatiently granting several extensions and issuing pointed warnings,\n\nfinally decided that enough was enough.         It held the defendants to\n\nthe deadlines previously announced, denied certain of their motions\n\nfor noncompliance with the court's scheduling order, disregarded\n\nthe defendants' tardy opposition to a motion for partial summary\n\njudgment, took the proffer of plaintiff-appellee Minerva Vélez-\n\nCortes (Vélez) as true, and resolved the issue of liability in\n\nVélez's favor.     A jury thereafter awarded Vélez nearly three-\n\nquarters of a million dollars in damages.          The defendants appeal.\n\nDiscerning no semblance of error, we affirm.\n\nI.   TRAVEL OF THE CASE\n\n           Vélez began work for a company owned by Ismael Nieves-\n\nValle   (Nieves)   in   1987.     In    time,   Vélez   and   Nieves    became\n\nromantically entangled.         Vélez claims that after she broke off\n\ntheir adulterous affair, she was sexually harassed.                She further\n\nclaims that, in March 2000, this harassment culminated in her\n\ndismissal.\n\n           On   March   26,     2002,   Vélez   commenced     an    employment\n\ndiscrimination action against AWI and Nieves in Puerto Rico's\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\ffederal district court.1    Her complaint invoked 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e\n\nto   2000e-16    (Title   VII)   and     a   plethora   of    Puerto   Rican\n\ndiscrimination statutes. See, e.g., 29 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 146, 155-\n\n155l.    Pretrial discovery revealed a dalliance gone sour and, on\n\nthe plaintiff's account, an ensuing campaign of harassment leading\n\nto her discharge.\n\n           As this appeal turns largely on the travel and procedural\n\nhistory of the case, we eschew any further discussion of the facts\n\nat this point.    Instead, we set out a procedural chronology (each\n\ndate refers to the time when the filing in question was entered on\n\nthe district court's docket).\n\n           1. March 26, 2002.      The plaintiff instituted\n           the action.\n\n           2. April 30, 2002. The plaintiff moved for\n           the entry of default, see Fed. R. Civ. P.\n           55(a), because the defendants failed to answer\n           or otherwise plead within the allotted twenty-\n           day period.\n\n           3. May 3, 2002. The district court ordered\n           the defendants to show cause, on or before May\n           15, why a default should not be entered.\n\n           4. May 22, 2002. The plaintiff renewed her\n           motion for entry of default, noting that\n           neither defendant had responded to the show-\n           cause order.\n\n           5.    May 31, 2002.      The        district      court\n           defaulted both defendants.\n\n\n\n     1\n      Nieves owned several companies.           During the relevant time\nframe, Vélez worked for two of them.           These companies merged in\n2002 to form AWI.\n\n                                   -3-\n\f6.   June 6, 2002.    Citing Nieves's sudden\ndeath in a helicopter accident on May 25, AWI\nasked the district court to set aside the\ndefault and afford the defendants forty-five\nadditional days within which to answer the\ncomplaint.\n\n7. June 24, 2002. The district court granted\nthe plaintiff's request to substitute the\nEstate in Nieves's stead as a party defendant.\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(a)(1). The court also\ngranted AWI's request to set aside the default\nand ordered the defendants to answer or\notherwise plead by July 19. The court warned\nthat failure to comply \"on or before the\naforementioned date SHALL result in the Court\nre-entering default and proceeding with a\nDamages Hearing.\"\n\n8.   July 11, 2002. The defendants answered\nthe plaintiff's complaint.   Discovery then\nensued.\n\n9.  November 15, 2002.   The plaintiff moved\nfor partial summary judgment on the issue of\nliability.\n\n10.    December 2, 2002.     The defendants'\nopposition to the motion for partial summary\njudgment was due, but none was filed.\n\n11.   December 5, 2002.  The district court\ngranted the defendants until December 13 to\nsubmit their opposition.\n\n12.   December 13, 2002.    Instead of filing\ntheir opposition by the extended deadline, the\ndefendants moved for a further extension.\n\n13.   December 17, 2002. The district court\nheld an omnibus scheduling conference (the\nOSC).\n\n14. December 20, 2002. The court entered an\norder    that,    inter alia,    directed   the\ndefendants to file (i) no later than January\n7,    2003,    answers  to   the    plaintiff's\n\n\n                     -4-\n\finterrogatories; (ii) no later than January\n17, 2003, a legal memorandum, concerning the\n\"admissibility of hearsay and other evidence\"\nfollowing a party's death prior to discovery;\nand (iii) no later than January 17, 2003, a\nmemorandum detailing AWI's finances and the\nEstate's assets.   The court admonished that\nthe defendants' failure to comply with any of\nthese directives would \"result in sanctions\nincluding . . . elimination of all defenses\nset forth in their answer to the complaint.\"\n\n       In tandem with these orders, the court\nfurther extended the time for filing an\nopposition to the plaintiff's motion for\npartial summary judgment. The court fixed\nFebruary 20 as the due date for the\nopposition, warned the defendants that \"[n]o\nextensions will be given,\" and advised them\nthat, should they \"fail to file an opposition\non or before the aforementioned date the Court\nSHALL    consider   Plaintiff's   motion    as\nunopposed.\"\n\n15. January 7, 2003. The defendants served\ntheir answers to interrogatories.\n\n16. January 15, 2003. The defendants filed a\nmotion to dismiss, alleging that the plaintiff\ndid not have a cause of action against Nieves\n(and, therefore, could not sue the Estate)\nbecause supervisors are not personally liable\nunder Title VII.\n\n17. January 17, 2003. The defendants moved\nfor an extension of time, up to and including\nFebruary 4, 2003, within which to file the\nhearsay memorandum and comply with the\nremaining commands of the OSC. Although the\ncourt took no immediate action on this motion,\nthe defendants failed to make the required\nfilings.\n\n18. February 5, 2003. Citing the plaintiff's\ndelay in completing her deposition and answers\nto interrogatories, the defendants moved to\nextend the deadline for filing an opposition\n\n\n                     -5-\n\fto the motion for partial summary judgment\nfrom February 20 to February 28.\n\n19. February 20, 2003. (This was the date\nset by the district court for the filing of\nthe opposition to the motion for partial\nsummary judgment.) Although the court had not\nyet ruled on their last previous motion for an\nextension, the defendants asked for another\nextension, this time to March 3, for the\nfiling of their opposition.\n\n20.   March 18, 2003.     The defendants made\nmultiple submissions: (i) they finally filed\ntheir opposition to the plaintiff's motion for\npartial summary judgment; (ii) in the same\nmemorandum, doubling in brass as a motion to\ndismiss, they claimed for the first time that\nthe plaintiff had failed to file a timely\nadministrative   complaint   with    the   Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (the EEOC)\nand that, as a consequence, her action should\nbe jettisoned for want of subject-matter\njurisdiction;   and   (iii)   in   a    separate\nmemorandum,   they   addressed   the   district\ncourt's hearsay concerns.\n\n21. March 20, 2003. Faithful to its earlier\nwarning that no extensions of time would be\ncountenanced, the district court disregarded\nthe defendants' out-of-time filings, denied\ntheir sundry extension requests, and deemed\nthe plaintiff's motion for partial summary\njudgment unopposed.    As a sanction for the\ndefendants' failure to comply with the court's\nearlier   order to    submit   both  a   legal\nmemorandum anent hearsay evidence (which had\nbeen filed over two months late) and a\nmemorandum detailing the defendants' financial\nresources (which had not been filed at all),\nthe court denied the defendants' motion to\ndismiss the supervisory liability claim.\n\n22.   March 23, 2003.     The district court\nrefused to dismiss the case for lack of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n                      -6-\n\f           23.   March 25, 2003.      The district court\n           handed down an opinion in which it granted the\n           plaintiff's   motion   for   partial   summary\n           judgment. See Vélez Cortes v. Nieves Valle,\n           253 F. Supp. 2d 206 (D.P.R. 2003).        That\n           decision resolved the issue of liability.\n\n           24.   July 22-24, 2003.   The district court\n           convened a damages hearing before a jury and,\n           pursuant to the jury's verdict, entered final\n           judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of\n           $740,000.\n\n           25. August 15, 2003. The defendants filed a\n           timely notice of appeal.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n           The defendants' assignments of error can be grouped under\n\nthree headings:    (i) errors concerning the lower court's entry of\n\npartial summary judgment; (ii) errors concerning the lower court's\n\ndenial of the defendants' two motions to dismiss; and (iii) errors\n\npertaining to the lower court's issuance of an order for legal\n\nmemoranda anent hearsay evidence.      We address each grouping in\n\nturn.\n\n           A.   The Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.\n\n           The defendants' principal complaint is that the district\n\ncourt erred in granting the plaintiff's motion for partial summary\n\njudgment without considering their late-filed opposition.    On the\n\ndefendants' view of the proceedings, the trial judge's decision to\n\ncommit the case to a fast-track schedule caused him to turn a blind\n\neye to the defendants' pressing need for additional time to conduct\n\ndiscovery and muster their opposition.\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f              We agree with the defendants that trial courts should\n\nrefrain from entertaining summary judgment motions until after the\n\nparties have had a sufficient opportunity to conduct necessary\n\ndiscovery.      See Carmona v. Toledo, 215 F.3d 124, 132-33, 135-36\n\n(1st Cir. 2000); Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc., 89 F.3d 24,\n\n29-30 (1st Cir. 1996).        It follows that when a party moves for\n\nsummary judgment, the opposing party must be afforded a fair chance\n\nto   obtain     and   synthesize   available   information   before   being\n\nrequired to file an opposition.            Our cases make it pellucid,\n\nhowever, that this prophylactic rule is not self-executing.               A\n\nparty who legitimately requires more time to oppose a motion for\n\nsummary judgment has a corollary responsibility to make the court\n\naware of its plight.\n\n              Typically, this is accomplished by way of either a Rule\n\n56(f) motion or its functional equivalent.2           See Vargas-Ruiz v.\n\nGolden Arch Dev., Inc., 368 F.3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 2004); Corrada\n\n\n\n      2\n          The rule provides that:\n\n              Should it appear from the affidavits of a\n              party opposing the motion that the party\n              cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit\n              facts essential to justify the party's\n              opposition,   the   court   may   refuse   the\n              application for judgment or may order a\n              continuance to permit affidavits to be\n              obtained or depositions to be taken or\n              discovery to be had or may make such other\n              order as is just.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).\n\n                                     -8-\n\fBetances v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc., 248 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nThe record on appeal contains nothing of the sort:       the defendants\n\nneither invoked nor substantially complied with Rule 56(f).              To\n\nbenefit from the protections of Rule 56(f), a litigant ordinarily\n\nmust furnish the nisi prius court with a timely statement — if not\n\nby affidavit, then in some other authoritative manner — that (i)\n\nexplains his or her current inability to adduce the facts essential\n\nto filing an opposition, (ii) provides a plausible basis for\n\nbelieving that the sought-after facts can be assembled within a\n\nreasonable   time,   and   (iii)   indicates   how   those   facts    would\n\ninfluence the outcome of the pending summary judgment motion.           See\n\nVargas-Ruiz, 368 F.3d at 4; Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun.\n\nWholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 988 (1st Cir. 1988).              Such a\n\nlitigant also must have exercised \"due diligence both in pursuing\n\ndiscovery before the summary judgment initiative surfaces and in\n\npursuing an extension of time thereafter.\"       Resolution Trust Corp.\n\nv. N. Bridge Assocs., Inc., 22 F.3d 1198, 1203 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n          The defendants' motions to extend time, filed on February\n\n5 and February 20, do not satisfy these criteria.3       Neither motion\n\nidentifies a single sought-after fact.         Neither motion indicates\n\nwhether the desired information can be gathered within a reasonable\n\n\n\n     3\n      We note that these motions, collectively, sought to extend\nthe time for filing the defendants' opposition to March 3, 2003.\nIn point of fact, the opposition was not filed until March 18,\n2003.\n\n                                   -9-\n\finterval.      And neither motion relates how that information, if\n\nunearthed, would influence the outcome of the pending summary\n\njudgment motion.\n\n            What the February motions do attempt to provide are\n\nreasons why     an   extension   should   be   granted.      The    defendants\n\nattribute their predicament to a week-long delay in the taking of\n\nthe plaintiff's deposition, a week-long delay in the plaintiff's\n\nservice   of   answers   to   interrogatories,    and     defense    counsel's\n\nprofessed \"need\" to travel to Florida \"in matters regarding to\n\n[sic] our legal profession.\"      These are more excuses than reasons.\n\nThe deposition was completed a full two weeks before the court-\n\nappointed deadline for filing an opposition, and the plaintiff\n\nanswered the interrogatories in approximately the same time frame.\n\nLast — but far from least — the fact that counsel may have bitten\n\noff more than he could chew does not exempt him from meeting court-\n\nappointed deadlines.     See Mendez v. Banco Popular, 900 F.2d 4, 6-7\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (collecting cases); see also Pinero Schroeder v.\n\nFNMA, 574 F.2d 1117, 1118 (1st Cir. 1978) (per curiam) (\"Most\n\nattorneys are busy most of the time and they must organize their\n\nwork so as to be able to meet the time requirements of matters they\n\nare handling or suffer the consequences.\").\n\n            The defendants now try to rectify some of their earlier\n\nomissions.     In this court, they attribute the need for a further\n\nextension to a motley of events, including Nieves's untimely\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fdemise, a switch in counsel resulting from his death, and the fact\n\nthat the plaintiff's attorneys closed their offices for two weeks.\n\nThese importunings are too little and too late.        A party who seeks\n\nto be relieved from a court-appointed deadline has an obligation,\n\nat a bare minimum, to present his arguments for relief to the\n\nordering court.      An unexcused failure to do so constitutes a\n\nwaiver.   See McCoy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech., 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (explaining that matters not raised squarely in the\n\ndistrict court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal).\n\n          Here, moreover, the defendants' proffered reasons are\n\nless than compelling.     Nieves died on May 25, 2002 — almost nine\n\nmonths before the due date for the defendants' opposition.              The\n\nswitch in counsel occurred in that same time frame — and in any\n\nevent, a party's decision to discharge one lawyer and retain\n\nanother does not serve as a free pass to ignore court-appointed\n\ndeadlines.     Finally, the relevance of the office closing is less\n\nthan obvious, and the defendants do nothing to enlighten us.\n\n          To     cinch   matters,    it    would   strain   credulity    to\n\ncharacterize the defendants' pretrial discovery efforts in this\n\ncase as duly diligent. As the chronology indicates, see supra Part\n\nI, the defendants dragged their feet from the very inception of the\n\naction. They had ample time to conduct discovery (roughly one year\n\nelapsed between the start of suit and the entry of partial summary\n\njudgment).     By the same token, they had ample time to prepare an\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fopposition (the court allowed them over three months from the date\n\nthe plaintiff filed her motion for partial summary judgment and\n\napproximately two months from the date of the OSC).                In the\n\nordinary course, a party protesting what he believes to be a\n\ngadarene rush to judgment in the face of delayed discovery must\n\nhave offered to the district court a credible and convincing\n\nexplanation for his inability to obtain the necessary information\n\nwithin the time allotted.       See Vargas-Ruiz, 368 F.3d at 5.         The\n\ndefendants' explanations fall far short.\n\n           Appellate review of a district court's case-management\n\ndecisions is solely for abuse of discretion.               Rosario-Diaz v.\n\nGonzalez, 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir. 1998); C.B. Trucking, Inc. v.\n\nWaste   Mgmt.,   137   F.3d   41,   44   (1st   Cir.   1998).   Given   the\n\ncircumstances at hand, the district court plainly did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in proceeding, when it did, to decide the motion for\n\npartial summary judgment.      After all:\n\n           Rules are rules — and the parties must play by\n           them.   In the final analysis, the judicial\n           process depends heavily on the judge's\n           credibility.   To ensure such credibility, a\n           district judge must often be firm in managing\n           crowded dockets and demanding adherence to\n           announced deadlines.    If he or she sets a\n           reasonable due date, parties should not be\n           allowed casually to flout it or painlessly to\n           escape   the   foreseeable   consequences   of\n           noncompliance.\n\nMendez, 900 F.2d at 7.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f           The defendants have a fallback position: they claim that\n\ngenuine issues of material fact existed in the record and that the\n\nplaintiff was not entitled to a liability finding as a matter of\n\nlaw. We review the merits of the entry of partial summary judgment\n\nde novo.   Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).   Our response will be brief.\n\n           Because the defendants failed to file an opposition to\n\nthe motion for partial summary judgment by the court-appointed\n\ndeadline (February 20, 2003), the district judge was entitled to\n\nconsider the motion as unopposed and to disregard a subsequently\n\nfiled opposition.   See Mendez, 900 F.2d at 7-8 (collecting cases).\n\nIn the same vein, the court was obliged to take the plaintiff's\n\nstatement of uncontested facts as true.    See D.P.R.R. 311.12; see\n\nalso Euromodas, Inc. v. Zanella, Ltd., 368 F.3d 11, 14-15 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n           That does not mean, however, that summary judgment should\n\nautomatically follow. Even when faced with an unopposed motion for\n\nsummary judgment, a court still has the obligation to test the\n\nundisputed facts in the crucible of the applicable law in order to\n\nascertain whether judgment is warranted.    See Mendez, 900 F.2d at\n\n7; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (instructing that if the adverse\n\nparty fails to respond, \"summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be\n\nentered\") (emphasis supplied). The district court fully understood\n\nthis nuance.   It proceeded to align the undisputed facts and apply\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fthe proper adjudicative rules for sexual harassment claims to those\n\nfacts.   We need not dwell on the court's resulting handiwork.\n\n           By their inaction, the defendants allowed the plaintiff\n\nto configure the summary judgment record. Confronted with a set of\n\nfacts that pointed unerringly in one direction, the district court\n\ndid its duty.        \"We have long proclaimed that when a lower court\n\nproduces a comprehensive, well-reasoned decision, an appellate\n\ncourt should refrain from writing at length to no other end than to\n\nhear its own words resonate.\"         Lawton v. State Mut. Life Ins. Co.,\n\n101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir. 1996).            That principle pertains here.\n\nOn the merits, therefore, we affirm the district court's entry of\n\npartial summary judgment for substantially the reasons elucidated\n\nin the district court's erudite rescript.                See Vélez Cortes v.\n\nNieves Valle, 253 F. Supp. 2d 206, 212-15 (D.P.R. 2003).\n\n                        B.   The Motions to Dismiss.\n\n          The district court denied both of the defendants' motions\n\nto   dismiss    in    the    course    of     sanctioning     them   for   their\n\nnoncompliance with the OSC order.            A disgruntled litigant bears a\n\nheavy burden    in     attempting     to    challenge   the   imposition   of   a\n\nsanction arising out of the violation of a case-management order.\n\nSee United States v. One 1987 BMW 325, 985 F.2d 655, 657 (1st Cir.\n\n1993). Appellate review of such orders is for abuse of discretion.\n\nRosario-Diaz, 140 F.3d at 315.              An abuse of discretion presents\n\nitself \"when a material factor deserving significant weight is\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fignored, when an improper factor is relied upon, or when all proper\n\nand no improper factors are assessed, but the court makes a serious\n\nmistake in weighing them.\"           Indep. Oil & Chem. Workers of Quincy,\n\nInc. v. Procter & Gamble Mfg. Co., 864 F.2d 927, 929 (1st Cir.\n\n1988).\n\n               Where, as here, a trial court is faced with flagrant\n\ndisregard of a pretrial order, the court is authorized, either upon\n\nmotion or sua sponte, to \"make such orders with regard thereto as\n\nare just.\"         Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f).            Rule 16(f) incorporates by\n\nreference the compendium of remedies listed in Fed. R. Civ. P. 37.\n\nThat compendium         includes      \"[a]n       order    refusing     to    allow    the\n\ndisobedient        party   to    support    or    oppose    designated        claims    or\n\ndefenses.\"         Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(B).            The trial judge in this\n\ncase       acted   under   the   authority        granted   by   this    rule.         The\n\ndefendants contend that, in doing so, he ignored two material\n\nfactors       deserving    significant       weight       and,   thus,       abused    his\n\ndiscretion.         See Indep. Oil & Chem. Workers, 864 F.2d at 929.\n\n               First, the defendants insist that they substantially\n\ncomplied with the requirements of the OSC order.                   Their insistence\n\nis belied by the record.              In the first place, the financial\n\ndisclosure required by the court's order was never made.4                        In the\n\n\n       4\n      While it may be true that the defendants furnished some sort\nof financial statement to the plaintiff on December 6, 2002 (prior\nto the OSC), the district court obviously believed that more was\nrequired. The defendants must have understood this; after all,\nthey abjured any objection when the court entered the December 20\n\n                                           -15-\n\fsecond place, the defendants concede that the hearsay memorandum\n\nwas not filed until March 18, 2003 — two months after the deadline\n\nmandated by the district court's scheduling order.                  That this\n\nbelated filing occurred before the district court ruled on the\n\nmotions to dismiss makes no dispositive difference.\n\n                 The defendants' second argument is that the calendar\n\nestablished under the scheduling order was too rigorous.                        We\n\nalready have dealt with the essence of this argument.                See supra\n\nPart II(A).         To that, we add what the chronology makes apparent:\n\nthat the able trial judge bent over backwards to allow a reasonable\n\ntime for completion of pretrial matters. The record makes manifest\n\nthat       the    defendants'   cavalier     disregard    of   court-appointed\n\ndeadlines, not the district court's intransigence, led to their\n\ndownfall.         Given the district court's largesse and its explicit\n\nwarnings about the consequences of noncompliance, the court most\n\nassuredly did not abuse its discretion in hewing to its timetable.\n\n                 In an effort to alter this conclusion, the defendants\n\npoint out that the March 18 motion to dismiss implicated the\n\ncourt's subject-matter          jurisdiction.5     They    then   note   that   a\n\n\norder mandating fuller financial disclosure.         Their present\ncontention is, therefore, waived. See Reilly v. United States, 863\nF.2d 149, 159 (1st Cir. 1988) (explaining that a failure seasonably\nto object to a procedural order bars an appeal predicated thereon).\n       5\n      The other motion to dismiss, filed January 15, 2003, need not\nconcern us. That motion asserted that the claim against the Estate\nshould be dismissed because the law does not provide for\nsupervisory liability.     While that may be true of Title VII,\n\n                                      -16-\n\ffederal court's subject-matter jurisdiction may not be waived.\n\nBennett v. City of Holyoke, 362 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 2004).                      It\n\nfollows,    they    say,    that   federal   courts     are     precluded    from\n\nsanctioning litigants by refusing to consider their motions to\n\ndismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n            That proposition is true as far as it goes, but it does\n\nnot take the defendants very far.        The March 18 motion was premised\n\non the plaintiff's supposed failure to file timely charges with the\n\nEEOC.    Over two decades ago, the Supreme Court held that \"filing a\n\ntimely     charge   of     discrimination    with     the     EEOC   is   not      a\n\njurisdictional      prerequisite    to   suit    in   federal    court,     but    a\n\nrequirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject to\n\nwaiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling.\"              Zipes v. Trans World\n\nAirlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 393 (1982).               That the defendants\n\nimproperly classified this motion as raising a lack of subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction does not change its real nature. Consequently,\n\nthe district court was free to consider the denial of the motion as\n\na sanction.\n\n            We summarize succinctly.            On an appeal from an order\n\nimposing sanctions for noncompliance with a case-management order,\n\nwe must defer to the trial court's informed assessment of the\n\n\njudgment was entered in this case pursuant to 29 P.R. Laws Ann. §\n146. This statute imposes liability on supervisors for acts of\nsexual harassment. See Mejias Miranda v. BBII Acquis'n Corp., 120\nF. Supp. 2d 157, 172 (D.P.R. 2000). Thus, any error in denying\nthat motion to dismiss was harmless.\n\n                                     -17-\n\fsituation.     See Rosario-Diaz, 140 F.3d at 315 (\"[W]e acknowledge\n\nthe trial judge's special coign of vantage and give him a wide\n\nberth   to    determine       what   sanction   responds   most   aptly   to   a\n\nparticular infraction.\"); Legault v. Zambarano, 105 F.3d 24, 26\n\n(1st Cir. 1997) (discussing \"the importance of supporting a trial\n\ncourt's      decisions    concerning      sanctions\").        Applying    this\n\ndeferential standard of review, we discern no abuse of discretion\n\nin the district court's decision to deny the motions to dismiss as\n\na sanction.\n\n                         C.    The Hearsay Memorandum.\n\n             The defendants expend considerable energy calumnizing the\n\ndistrict court's method of handling the potential hearsay evidence\n\nissue in this case.            They tell us that the court abused its\n\ndiscretion when it (i) ordered a memorandum on the admissibility of\n\nhearsay evidence too early in the proceedings, (ii) sanctioned the\n\ndefendants (by precluding the use of certain hearsay testimony) for\n\ntheir failure seasonably to file the memorandum, and (iii) refused\n\nto consider the memorandum when it was submitted by the defendants\n\ntwo months late.     These calumnies ring hollow.\n\n             If there is one abiding truth illustrated by the travel\n\nof this case, see supra Part I, it is that the defendants would\n\nhave been better served expending their energies during discovery\n\nand other pretrial proceedings rather than on appeal.              The record\n\nreflects that they arrived at the OSC unprepared to participate\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\feffectively in the proceedings.        There is no indication that they\n\nobjected when the district court afforded them approximately one\n\nmonth     within   which   to   file   \"a   memorandum   concerning   the\n\nadmissibility of hearsay and other evidence in the occasion when a\n\nparty has died prior to having given a deposition and/or prior to\n\ntrial.\"    Nor is any basis for an objection apparent.       The January\n\n17 deadline fixed by the court gave the defendants ample time\n\nwithin which to research the hearsay issue.         Yet January 17 came\n\nand went without the filing of the requisite memorandum.\n\n            Courts are entitled — indeed, they should be encouraged\n\n— to ask counsel for input on legal issues that seem likely to\n\narise in the course of trial. Here, the defendants squandered what\n\nshould have been a welcome opportunity to persuade the court that\n\nhearsay evidence should be liberally admitted in view of Nieves's\n\ndemise.     When a litigant fails to comply with a case-management\n\norder, the court has substantial authority to impose a condign\n\nsanction.    See Tower Ventures, Inc. v. City of Westfield, 296 F.3d\n\n43, 45-46 (1st Cir. 2002).        We cannot say that the court below\n\nabused its discretion when it precluded certain hearsay testimony\n\nas a sanction for the defendants' protracted delay in submitting\n\nthe memorandum in question.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f) (providing,\n\nthrough reference to Rule 37(b)(2)(B), that a court may prohibit a\n\nlitigant \"from introducing designated matters in evidence\" as a\n\nsanction for noncompliance with a scheduling order).\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fIII. CONCLUSION\n\n            To sum up, the record in the instant case is replete with\n\ninstances of the defendants' disregard of court orders.     Even so,\n\nthe district court exhibited considerable patience in accommodating\n\nthe defendants' lapses.    And when the court finally drew a line in\n\nthe sand, it gave the defendants explicit warning that further\n\nprocrastination would risk severe consequences.       To accuse the\n\ncourt of abusing its discretion because the defendants chose\n\nstruthiously to ignore this warning stands logic on its ear.\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons alluded to above,\n\nwe uphold the entry of judgment for the plaintiff.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\f",

The defendants in this case &#8212; Awning Windows, Inc. (AWI) and the Estate of Ismael Nieves-Valle (the Estate) &#8212; acted in that fashion. The district court, after patiently granting several extensions and issuing pointed warnings, finally decided that enough was enough. It held the defendants to the deadlines previously announced, denied certain of their motions for noncompliance with the court's scheduling order, disregarded the defendants' tardy opposition to a motion for partial summary judgment, took the proffer of plaintiff-appellee Minerva V&#233;lez-Cortes (V&#233;lez) as true, and resolved the issue of liability in V&#233;lez's favor.

As a sanction for the defendants' failure to comply with the court's earlier order to submit both a legal memorandum anent hearsay evidence (which had been filed over two months late) and a memorandum detailing the defendants' financial resources (which had not been filed at all), the court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the supervisory liability claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">22. <i>March 23, 2003.</i> The district court refused to dismiss the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">23. <i>March 25, 2003.</i> The district court handed down an opinion in which it granted the plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment. <i>See V&#233;lez Cortes v.

DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' assignments of error can be grouped under three headings: (i) errors concerning the lower court's entry of partial summary judgment; (ii) errors concerning the lower court's denial of the defendants' two motions to dismiss; and (iii) errors pertaining to the lower court's issuance of an order for legal memoranda anent hearsay evidence. We address each grouping in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' principal complaint is that the district court erred in granting the plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment without considering their late-filed opposition. On the defendants' view of the proceedings, the trial judge's decision to commit the case to a fast-track schedule caused him to turn a blind eye to the defendants' pressing need for additional time to conduct discovery and muster their opposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the defendants that trial courts should refrain from entertaining summary judgment motions until after the parties have had a sufficient opportunity to conduct necessary discovery. <i>See Carmona v. Toledo,</i> 215 F.3d 124, 132-33, 135-36 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc.,</i> 89 F.3d 24, 29-30 (1st Cir.1996). It follows that when a party moves for summary judgment, the opposing party must be afforded a fair chance to obtain and synthesize available information before being required to file an opposition. Our cases make it pellucid, however, that this prophylactic rule is not self-executing. A party who legitimately requires more time to oppose a motion for summary judgment has a corollary responsibility to make the court aware of its plight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, this is accomplished by way of either a Rule 56(f) motion or its functional equivalent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See Vargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch Dev., Inc.,</i> 368 F.3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Corrada Betances v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc.,</i> 248 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir.2001). The record on appeal contains nothing of the sort: the defendants neither invoked nor substantially complied with Rule 56(f). To benefit from the protections of Rule 56(f), a litigant ordinarily must furnish the nisi prius court with a timely statement &#8212; if not by affidavit, then in some other authoritative manner &#8212; that (i) explains his or her current inability to adduce the facts essential to filing an opposition, (ii) provides a plausible basis for believing that the sought-after facts can be assembled within a reasonable time, and (iii) indicates how those facts would influence the outcome of the pending summary judgment motion. <i>See Vargas-Ruiz,</i> 368 F.3d at 4; <i>Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co.,</i> 840 F.2d 985, 988 (1st Cir.1988). Such a litigant also must have exercised \"due diligence both in pursuing discovery before the summary judgment initiative surfaces and in pursuing an extension of time thereafter.\" <i>Resolution Trust Corp. v. N. Bridge Assocs., Inc.,</i> 22 F.3d 1198, 1203 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' motions to extend time, filed on February 5 and February 20, do not satisfy these criteria.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Neither motion identifies a single sought-after fact. Neither motion indicates whether the desired information can be gathered within a reasonable interval. And neither motion relates how that information, if unearthed, would influence the outcome of the pending summary judgment motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What the February motions do attempt to provide are reasons why an extension should be granted. The defendants attribute their predicament to a week-long delay in the taking of the plaintiff's deposition, a week-long delay in the plaintiff's service of answers to interrogatories, and defense counsel's professed \"need\" to travel to Florida \"in matters regarding to [sic] our legal profession.\" These are more excuses than reasons. The deposition was completed a full two weeks before the court-appointed deadline for filing an opposition, and the plaintiff answered the interrogatories in approximately the same time frame. Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; the fact that counsel may have bitten off more than he could chew does not exempt him from meeting court-appointed deadlines. <i>See Mendez v. Banco Popular,</i> 900 F.2d 4, 6-7 (1st Cir.1990) (collecting cases); <i>see also Pinero Schroeder v. FNMA,</i> 574 F.2d 1117, 1118 (1st Cir.1978) (per curiam) (\"Most attorneys are busy most of the time and they must organize their work so as to be able to meet the time requirements of matters they are handling or suffer the consequences.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants now try to rectify some of their earlier omissions. In this court, they attribute the need for a further extension to a motley of events, including Nieves's untimely demise, a switch in counsel resulting from his death, and the fact that the plaintiff's attorneys closed their offices for two weeks. These importunings are too little and too late. A party who seeks to be relieved from a court-appointed deadline has an obligation, at a bare minimum, to present his arguments for relief to the ordering court. An unexcused failure to do so constitutes a waiver. <i>See McCoy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech.,</i> 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir.1991) (explaining that matters not raised squarely in the district court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, moreover, the defendants' proffered reasons are less than compelling. Nieves died on May 25, 2002 &#8212; almost nine months before the due date for the defendants' opposition. The switch in counsel occurred in that same time frame &#8212; and in any event, a party's decision to discharge one lawyer and retain another does not serve as a free pass to ignore court-appointed deadlines. Finally, the relevance of the office closing is less than obvious, and the defendants do nothing to enlighten us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, it would strain credulity to characterize the defendants' pretrial discovery efforts in this case as duly diligent. As the chronology indicates, <i>see supra</i> Part I, the defendants dragged their feet from the very inception of the action. They had ample time to conduct discovery (roughly one year elapsed between the start of suit and the entry of partial summary judgment). By the same token, they had ample time to prepare an opposition (the court allowed them over three months from the date the plaintiff filed her motion for partial summary judgment and approximately two months from the date of the OSC). In the ordinary course, a party protesting what he believes to be a gadarene rush to judgment in the face of delayed discovery must have offered to the district court a credible and convincing explanation for his inability to obtain the necessary information within the time allotted. <i>See Vargas-Ruiz,</i> 368 F.3d at 5. The defendants' explanations fall far short.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellate review of a district court's case-management decisions is solely for abuse of discretion. <i>Rosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez,</i> 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir. 1998); <i>C.B. Trucking, Inc. v. Waste Mgmt.,</i> 137 F.3d 41, 44 (1st Cir.1998). Given the circumstances at hand, the district court plainly did not abuse its discretion in proceeding, when it did, to decide the motion for partial summary judgment. After all:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rules are rules &#8212; and the parties must play by them. In the final analysis, the judicial process depends heavily on the judge's credibility. To ensure such credibility, a district judge must often be firm in managing crowded dockets and demanding adherence to announced deadlines. If he or she sets a reasonable due date, parties should not be allowed casually to flout it or painlessly to escape the foreseeable consequences of noncompliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mendez,</i> 900 F.2d at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants have a fallback position: they claim that genuine issues of material fact existed in the record and that the plaintiff was not entitled to a liability finding as a matter of law. We review the merits of the entry of partial summary judgment de novo. <i>Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.1990). Our response will be brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the defendants failed to file an opposition to the motion for partial summary judgment by the court-appointed deadline (February 20, 2003), the district judge was entitled to consider the motion as unopposed and to disregard a subsequently filed opposition. <i>See Mendez,</i> 900 F.2d at 7-8 (collecting cases). In the same vein, the court was obliged to take the plaintiff's statement of uncontested facts as true. <i>See</i> D.P.R.R. 311.12; <i>see also Euromodas, Inc. v. Zanella, Ltd.,</i> 368 F.3d 11, 14-15 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That does not mean, however, that summary judgment should automatically follow. Even when faced with an unopposed motion for summary judgment, a court still has the obligation to test the undisputed facts in the crucible of the applicable law in order to ascertain whether judgment is warranted. <i>See Mendez,</i> 900 F.2d at 7; <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (instructing that if the adverse party fails to respond, \"summary judgment, <i>if appropriate,</i> shall be entered\") (emphasis supplied). The district court fully understood this nuance. It proceeded to align the undisputed facts and apply the proper adjudicative rules for sexual harassment claims to those facts. We need not dwell on the court's resulting handiwork.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By their inaction, the defendants allowed the plaintiff to configure the summary judgment record. Confronted with a set of facts that pointed unerringly in one direction, the district court did its duty. \"We have long proclaimed that when a lower court produces a comprehensive, well-reasoned decision, an appellate court should refrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.\" <i>Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co.,</i> 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir.1996). That principle pertains here. On the merits, therefore, we affirm the district court's entry of partial summary judgment for substantially the reasons elucidated in the district court's erudite rescript. <i>See V&#233;lez Cortes v. Nieves Valle,</i> 253 F.Supp.2d 206, 212-15 (D.P.R.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Motions to Dismiss.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied both of the defendants' motions to dismiss in the course of sanctioning them for their noncompliance with the OSC order. A disgruntled litigant bears a heavy burden in attempting to challenge the imposition of a sanction arising out of the violation of a case-management order. <i>See United States v. One 1987 BMW 325,</i> 985 F.2d 655, 657 (1st Cir.1993). Appellate review of such orders is for abuse of discretion. <i>Rosario-Diaz,</i> 140 F.3d at 315. An abuse of discretion presents itself \"when a material factor deserving significant weight is ignored, when an improper factor is relied upon, or when all proper and no improper factors are assessed, but the court makes a serious mistake in weighing them.\" <i>Indep. Oil &amp; Chem. Workers of Quincy, Inc. v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co.,</i> 864 F.2d 927, 929 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, a trial court is faced with flagrant disregard of a pretrial order, the court is authorized, either upon motion or sua sponte, to \"make such orders with regard thereto as are just.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(f). Rule 16(f) incorporates by reference the compendium of remedies listed in Fed. R.Civ.P. 37. That compendium includes \"[a]n order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose designated claims or defenses.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(B). The trial judge in this case acted under the authority granted by this rule. The defendants contend that, in doing so, he ignored two material factors deserving significant weight and, thus, abused his discretion. <i>See Indep. Oil &amp; Chem. Workers,</i> 864 F.2d at 929.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the defendants insist that they substantially complied with the requirements of the OSC order. Their insistence is belied by the record. In the first place, the financial disclosure required by the court's order was never made.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In the second place, the defendants concede that the hearsay memorandum was not filed until March 18, 2003 &#8212; two months after the deadline mandated by the district court's scheduling order. That this belated filing occurred before the district court ruled on the motions to dismiss makes no dispositive difference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' second argument is that the calendar established under the scheduling order was too rigorous. We already have dealt with the essence of this argument. <i>See supra</i> Part II(A). To that, we add what the chronology makes apparent: that the able trial judge bent over backwards to allow a reasonable time for completion of pretrial matters. The record makes manifest that the defendants' cavalier disregard of court-appointed deadlines, not the district court's intransigence, led to their downfall. Given the district court's largesse and its explicit warnings about the consequences of noncompliance, the court most assuredly did not abuse its discretion in hewing to its timetable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to alter this conclusion, the defendants point out that the March 18 motion to dismiss implicated the court's subject-matter jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> They then note that a federal court's subject-matter jurisdiction may not be waived. <i>Bennett v. City of Holyoke,</i> 362 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir.2004). It follows, they say, that federal courts are precluded from sanctioning litigants by refusing to consider their motions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That proposition is true as far as it goes, but it does not take the defendants very far. The March 18 motion was premised on the plaintiff's supposed failure to file timely charges with the EEOC. Over two decades ago, the Supreme Court held that \"filing a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling.\" <i>Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</i> 455 U.S. 385, 393, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 71 L.Ed.2d 234 (1982). That the defendants improperly classified this motion as raising a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction does not change its real nature. Consequently, the district court was free to consider the denial of the motion as a sanction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize succinctly. On an appeal from an order imposing sanctions for noncompliance with a case-management order, we must defer to the trial court's informed assessment of the situation. <i>See Rosario-Diaz,</i> 140 F.3d at 315 (\"[W]e acknowledge the trial judge's special coign of vantage and give him a wide berth to determine what sanction responds most aptly to a particular infraction.\"); <i>Legault v. Zambarano,</i> 105 F.3d 24, 26 (1st Cir.1997) (discussing \"the importance of supporting a trial court's decisions concerning sanctions\"). Applying this deferential standard of review, we discern no abuse of discretion in the district court's decision to deny the motions to dismiss as a sanction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Hearsay Memorandum.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants expend considerable energy calumnizing the district court's method of handling the potential hearsay evidence issue in this case. They tell us that the court abused its discretion when it (i) ordered a memorandum on the admissibility of hearsay evidence too early in the proceedings, (ii) sanctioned the defendants (by precluding the use of certain hearsay testimony) for their failure seasonably to file the memorandum, and (iii) refused to consider the memorandum when it was submitted by the defendants two months late. These calumnies ring hollow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there is one abiding truth illustrated by the travel of this case, <i>see supra</i> Part I, it is that the defendants would have been better served expending their energies during discovery and other pretrial proceedings rather than on appeal. The record reflects that they arrived at the OSC unprepared to participate effectively in the proceedings. There is no indication that they objected when the district court afforded them approximately one month within which to file \"a memorandum concerning the admissibility of hearsay and other evidence in the occasion when a party has died prior to having given a deposition and/or prior to trial.\" Nor is any basis for an objection apparent. The January 17 deadline fixed by the court gave the defendants ample time within which to research the hearsay issue. Yet January 17 came and went without the filing of the requisite memorandum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts are entitled &#8212; indeed, they should be encouraged &#8212; to ask counsel for input on legal issues that seem likely to arise in the course of trial. Here, the defendants squandered what should have been a welcome opportunity to persuade the court that hearsay evidence should be liberally admitted in view of Nieves's demise. When a litigant fails to comply with a case-management order, the court has substantial authority to impose a condign sanction. <i>See Tower Ventures, Inc. v. City of Westfield,</i> 296 F.3d 43, 45-46 (1st Cir.2002). We cannot say that the court below abused its discretion when it precluded certain hearsay testimony as a sanction for the defendants' protracted delay in submitting the memorandum in question. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 16(f) (providing, through reference to Rule 37(b)(2)(B), that a court may prohibit a litigant \"from introducing designated matters in evidence\" as a sanction for noncompliance with a scheduling order).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the record in the instant case is replete with instances of the defendants' disregard of court orders. Even so, the district court exhibited considerable patience in accommodating the defendants' lapses. And when the court finally drew a line in the sand, it gave the defendants explicit warning that further procrastination would risk severe consequences. To accuse the court of abusing its discretion because the defendants chose struthiously to ignore this warning stands logic on its ear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons alluded to above, we uphold the entry of judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Nieves owned several companies.

DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' assignments of error can be grouped under three headings: (i) errors concerning the lower court's entry of partial summary judgment; (ii) errors concerning the lower court's denial of the defendants' two motions to dismiss; and (iii) errors pertaining to the lower court's issuance of an order for legal memoranda anent hearsay evidence. We address each grouping in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' principal complaint is that the district court erred in granting the plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment without considering their late-filed opposition. On the defendants' view of the proceedings, the trial judge's decision to commit the case to a fast-track schedule caused him to turn a blind eye to the defendants' pressing need for additional time to conduct discovery and muster their opposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the defendants that trial courts should refrain from entertaining summary judgment motions until after the parties have had a sufficient opportunity to conduct necessary discovery. <i>See Carmona v. Toledo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198967\"><a href=\"/opinion/198967/carmona-v-toledo/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 132-33, 135-36 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Berkovitz v.

It follows that when a party moves for summary judgment, the opposing party must be afforded a fair chance to obtain and synthesize available information before being required to file an opposition. Our cases make it pellucid, however, that this prophylactic rule is not self-executing. A party who legitimately requires more time to oppose a motion for summary judgment has a corollary responsibility to make the court aware of its plight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, this is accomplished by way of either a Rule 56(f) motion or its functional equivalent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See Vargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch Dev., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201001\"><a href=\"/opinion/201001/vargas-ruiz-v-golden-arch/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3-4 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Corrada Betances v.

The record on appeal contains nothing of the sort: the defendants neither invoked nor substantially complied with Rule 56(f). To benefit from the protections of Rule 56(f), a litigant ordinarily must furnish the nisi prius court with a timely statement &#8212; if not by affidavit, then in some other authoritative manner &#8212; that (i) explains his or her current inability to adduce the facts essential to filing an opposition, (ii) provides a plausible basis for believing that the sought-after facts can be assembled within a reasonable time, and (iii) indicates how those facts would influence the outcome of the pending summary judgment motion. <i>See Vargas-Ruiz,</i> 368 F.3d at 4; <i>Paterson-Leitch Co. v.

Such a litigant also must have exercised \"due diligence both in pursuing discovery before the summary judgment initiative surfaces and in pursuing an extension of time thereafter.\" <i>Resolution Trust Corp. v.

The defendants attribute their predicament to a week-long delay in the taking of the plaintiff's deposition, a week-long delay in the plaintiff's service of answers to interrogatories, and defense counsel's professed \"need\" to travel to Florida \"in matters regarding to [sic] our legal profession.\" These are more excuses than reasons. The deposition was completed a full two weeks before the court-appointed deadline for filing an opposition, and the plaintiff answered the interrogatories in approximately the same time frame. Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; the fact that counsel may have bitten off more than he could chew does not exempt him from meeting court-appointed deadlines. <i>See Mendez v. Banco Popular,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539215\"><a href=\"/opinion/539215/julio-mendez-aka-julio-mendez-rodriguez-v-banco-popular-de-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 6-7 (1st Cir.1990) (collecting cases); <i>see also Pinero Schroeder v.

In this court, they attribute the need for a further extension to a motley of events, including Nieves's untimely demise, a switch in counsel resulting from his death, and the fact that the plaintiff's attorneys closed their offices for two weeks. These importunings are too little and too late. A party who seeks to be relieved from a court-appointed deadline has an obligation, at a bare minimum, to present his arguments for relief to the ordering court. An unexcused failure to do so constitutes a waiver. <i>See McCoy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572652\"><a href=\"/opinion/572652/james-l-mccoy-administrator-of-the-electrical-workers-trust-funds-etc-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1991) (explaining that matters not raised squarely in the district court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, moreover, the defendants' proffered reasons are less than compelling. Nieves died on May 25, 2002 &#8212; almost nine months before the due date for the defendants' opposition. The switch in counsel occurred in that same time frame &#8212; and in any event, a party's decision to discharge one lawyer and retain another does not serve as a free pass to ignore court-appointed deadlines. Finally, the relevance of the office closing is less than obvious, and the defendants do nothing to enlighten us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, it would strain credulity to characterize the defendants' pretrial discovery efforts in this case as duly diligent. As the chronology indicates, <i>see supra</i> Part I, the defendants dragged their feet from the very inception of the action. They had ample time to conduct discovery (roughly one year elapsed between the start of suit and the entry of partial summary judgment). By the same token, they had ample time to prepare an opposition (the court allowed them over three months from the date the plaintiff filed her motion for partial summary judgment and approximately two months from the date of the OSC). In the ordinary course, a party protesting what he believes to be a gadarene rush to judgment in the face of delayed discovery must have offered to the district court a credible and convincing explanation for his inability to obtain the necessary information within the time allotted. <i>See Vargas-Ruiz,</i> 368 F.3d at 5.

Given the circumstances at hand, the district court plainly did not abuse its discretion in proceeding, when it did, to decide the motion for partial summary judgment. After all:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rules are rules &#8212; and the parties must play by them. In the final analysis, the judicial process depends heavily on the judge's credibility. To ensure such credibility, a district judge must often be firm in managing crowded dockets and demanding adherence to announced deadlines. If he or she sets a reasonable due date, parties should not be allowed casually to flout it or painlessly to escape the foreseeable consequences of noncompliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mendez,</i> 900 F.2d at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants have a fallback position: they claim that genuine issues of material fact existed in the record and that the plaintiff was not entitled to a liability finding as a matter of law. We review the merits of the entry of partial summary judgment de novo. <i>Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536033\"><a href=\"/opinion/536033/milissa-garside-v-osco-drug-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.1990). Our response will be brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the defendants failed to file an opposition to the motion for partial summary judgment by the court-appointed deadline (February 20, 2003), the district judge was entitled to consider the motion as unopposed and to disregard a subsequently filed opposition. <i>See Mendez,</i> 900 F.2d at 7-8 (collecting cases). In the same vein, the court was obliged to take the plaintiff's statement of uncontested facts as true. <i>See</i> D.P.R.R. 311.12; <i>see also Euromodas, Inc. v. Zanella, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201001\"><a href=\"/opinion/201001/vargas-ruiz-v-golden-arch/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>1, 14-15 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That does not mean, however, that summary judgment should automatically follow. Even when faced with an unopposed motion for summary judgment, a court still has the obligation to test the undisputed facts in the crucible of the applicable law in order to ascertain whether judgment is warranted. <i>See Mendez,</i> 900 F.2d at 7; <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (instructing that if the adverse party fails to respond, \"summary judgment, <i>if appropriate,</i> shall be entered\") (emphasis supplied). The district court fully understood this nuance. It proceeded to align the undisputed facts and apply the proper adjudicative rules for sexual harassment claims to those facts. We need not dwell on the court's resulting handiwork.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By their inaction, the defendants allowed the plaintiff to configure the summary judgment record. Confronted with a set of facts that pointed unerringly in one direction, the district court did its duty. \"We have long proclaimed that when a lower court produces a comprehensive, well-reasoned decision, an appellate court should refrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.\" <i>Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197113\"><a href=\"/opinion/197113/lawton-v-state-mutual/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 220 (1st Cir.1996). That principle pertains here. On the merits, therefore, we affirm the district court's entry of partial summary judgment for substantially the reasons elucidated in the district court's erudite rescript. <i>See V&#233;lez Cortes v. Nieves Valle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2567809\"><a href=\"/opinion/2567809/velez-cortes-v-nieves-valle/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 212-15 (D.P.R.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Motions to Dismiss.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied both of the defendants' motions to dismiss in the course of sanctioning them for their noncompliance with the OSC order. A disgruntled litigant bears a heavy burden in attempting to challenge the imposition of a sanction arising out of the violation of a case-management order. <i>See United States v. One 1987 BMW 325,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600264\"><a href=\"/opinion/600264/no-92-1827/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span>, 657 (1st Cir.1993). Appellate review of such orders is for abuse of discretion. <i>Rosario-Diaz,</i> 140 F.3d at 315. An abuse of discretion presents itself \"when a material factor deserving significant weight is ignored, when an improper factor is relied upon, or when all proper and no improper factors are assessed, but the court makes a serious mistake in weighing them.\" <i>Indep. Oil &amp; Chem. Workers of Quincy, Inc. v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516410\"><a href=\"/opinion/516410/the-independent-oil-and-chemical-workers-of-quincy-inc-v-the-procter/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></a></span>, 929 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, a trial court is faced with flagrant disregard of a pretrial order, the court is authorized, either upon motion or sua sponte, to \"make such orders with regard thereto as are just.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(f). Rule 16(f) incorporates by reference the compendium of remedies listed in Fed. R.Civ.P. 37. That compendium includes \"[a]n order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose designated claims or defenses.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(B). The trial judge in this case acted under the authority granted by this rule. The defendants contend that, in doing so, he ignored two material factors deserving significant weight and, thus, abused his discretion. <i>See Indep. Oil &amp; Chem. Workers,</i> 864 F.2d at 929.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the defendants insist that they substantially complied with the requirements of the OSC order. Their insistence is belied by the record. In the first place, the financial disclosure required by the court's order was never made.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In the second place, the defendants concede that the hearsay memorandum was not filed until March 18, 2003 &#8212; two months after the deadline mandated by the district court's scheduling order. That this belated filing occurred before the district court ruled on the motions to dismiss makes no dispositive difference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' second argument is that the calendar established under the scheduling order was too rigorous. We already have dealt with the essence of this argument. <i>See supra</i> Part II(A). To that, we add what the chronology makes apparent: that the able trial judge bent over backwards to allow a reasonable time for completion of pretrial matters. The record makes manifest that the defendants' cavalier disregard of court-appointed deadlines, not the district court's intransigence, led to their downfall. Given the district court's largesse and its explicit warnings about the consequences of noncompliance, the court most assuredly did not abuse its discretion in hewing to its timetable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to alter this conclusion, the defendants point out that the March 18 motion to dismiss implicated the court's subject-matter jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> They then note that a federal court's subject-matter jurisdiction may not be waived. <i>Bennett v. City of Holyoke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200925\"><a href=\"/opinion/200925/bennett-v-city-of-holyoke/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7-8 (1st Cir.2004). It follows, they say, that federal courts are precluded from sanctioning litigants by refusing to consider their motions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That proposition is true as far as it goes, but it does not take the defendants very far. The March 18 motion was premised on the plaintiff's supposed failure to file timely charges with the EEOC. Over two decades ago, the Supreme Court held that \"filing a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling.\" <i>Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110655\"><a href=\"/opinion/110655/zipes-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span>, 393, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110655\"><a href=\"/opinion/110655/zipes-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1127</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110655\"><a href=\"/opinion/110655/zipes-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span> (1982). That the defendants improperly classified this motion as raising a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction does not change its real nature. Consequently, the district court was free to consider the denial of the motion as a sanction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize succinctly. On an appeal from an order imposing sanctions for noncompliance with a case-management order, we must defer to the trial court's informed assessment of the situation. <i>See Rosario-Diaz,</i> 140 F.3d at 315 (\"[W]e acknowledge the trial judge's special coign of vantage and give him a wide berth to determine what sanction responds most aptly to a particular infraction.\"); <i>Legault v. Zambarano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197179\"><a href=\"/opinion/197179/legault-v-arusso/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1997) (discussing \"the importance of supporting a trial court's decisions concerning sanctions\"). Applying this deferential standard of review, we discern no abuse of discretion in the district court's decision to deny the motions to dismiss as a sanction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Hearsay Memorandum.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants expend considerable energy calumnizing the district court's method of handling the potential hearsay evidence issue in this case. They tell us that the court abused its discretion when it (i) ordered a memorandum on the admissibility of hearsay evidence too early in the proceedings, (ii) sanctioned the defendants (by precluding the use of certain hearsay testimony) for their failure seasonably to file the memorandum, and (iii) refused to consider the memorandum when it was submitted by the defendants two months late. These calumnies ring hollow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there is one abiding truth illustrated by the travel of this case, <i>see supra</i> Part I, it is that the defendants would have been better served expending their energies during discovery and other pretrial proceedings rather than on appeal. The record reflects that they arrived at the OSC unprepared to participate effectively in the proceedings. There is no indication that they objected when the district court afforded them approximately one month within which to file \"a memorandum concerning the admissibility of hearsay and other evidence in the occasion when a party has died prior to having given a deposition and/or prior to trial.\" Nor is any basis for an objection apparent. The January 17 deadline fixed by the court gave the defendants ample time within which to research the hearsay issue. Yet January 17 came and went without the filing of the requisite memorandum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts are entitled &#8212; indeed, they should be encouraged &#8212; to ask counsel for input on legal issues that seem likely to arise in the course of trial. Here, the defendants squandered what should have been a welcome opportunity to persuade the court that hearsay evidence should be liberally admitted in view of Nieves's demise. When a litigant fails to comply with a case-management order, the court has substantial authority to impose a condign sanction. <i>See Tower Ventures, Inc. v. City of Westfield,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200043\"><a href=\"/opinion/200043/tower-ventures-inc-v-city-of-westfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 45-46 (1st Cir.2002). We cannot say that the court below abused its discretion when it precluded certain hearsay testimony as a sanction for the defendants' protracted delay in submitting the memorandum in question. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 16(f) (providing, through reference to Rule 37(b)(2)(B), that a court may prohibit a litigant \"from introducing designated matters in evidence\" as a sanction for noncompliance with a scheduling order).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the record in the instant case is replete with instances of the defendants' disregard of court orders. Even so, the district court exhibited considerable patience in accommodating the defendants' lapses. And when the court finally drew a line in the sand, it gave the defendants explicit warning that further procrastination would risk severe consequences. To accuse the court of abusing its discretion because the defendants chose struthiously to ignore this warning stands logic on its ear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons alluded to above, we uphold the entry of judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Nieves owned several companies.

In point of fact, the opposition was not filed until March 18, 2003</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> While it may be true that the defendants furnished some sort of financial statement to the plaintiff on December 6, 2002 (prior to the OSC), the district court obviously believed that more was required. The defendants must have understood this; after all, they abjured any objection when the court entered the December 20 order mandating fuller financial disclosure. Their present contention is, therefore, waived<i>See Reilly v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515719\"><a href=\"/opinion/515719/donna-reilly-etc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 159 (1st Cir.1988) (explaining that a failure seasonably to object to a procedural order bars an appeal predicated thereon).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The other motion to dismiss, filed January 15, 2003, need not concern us. That motion asserted that the claim against the Estate should be dismissed because the law does not provide for supervisory liability. While that may be true of Title VII, judgment was entered in this case pursuant to 29 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 146. This statute imposes liability on supervisors for acts of sexual harassment<i>See Meijas Miranda v. BBII Acquis'n Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2499547\"><a href=\"/opinion/2499547/mejias-miranda-v-bbii-acquisition-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 172 (D.P.R.2000). Thus, any error in denying that motion to dismiss was harmless.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
