This case raises a new issue of\n\nimportance under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (TCA), Pub. L.\n\nNo.   104-104,   110   Stat.   56   (codified   as   amended    in   scattered\n\nsections of 47 U.S.C.).        The question is whether the doctrine of\n\nissue preclusion applies so as to bind one state's commission to\n\napply the findings and conclusions of another state's commission in\n\ndisputes between the same parties about the interpretation of\n\nidentical    contract     language     contained     in     different    state\n\ninterconnection agreements.\n\n            The district court concluded that the Full Faith and\n\nCredit Clause compelled application of the doctrine.                 Its order\n\nbound the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy\n\n(DTE),   which   was   interpreting    a    Massachusetts     interconnection\n\nagreement between Global NAPs, Inc. (Global) and Verizon New\n\nEngland, Inc. (Verizon), to follow the earlier decision of the\n\nRhode Island Public Utility Commission (RIPUC) as to the effect of\n\na prior order by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on the\n\nparties' Rhode Island interconnection agreement.                 On de novo\n\nreview, we reverse.     The district court's reasoning is contrary to\n\nthe language of and policies behind the TCA.\n\n            Underlying this legal issue is the question of whether\n\nVerizon owes an estimated $30 to $50 million in payments to Global\n\nas    \"reciprocal   compensation\"     for    calls   placed    by    Verizon's\n\ncustomers to Global's customers connected through an internet\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fservice provider (ISP) in Massachusetts during the period from July\n\n24, 2000 to June 14, 2001.\n\n            The DTE ruled on June 24, 2002 that Verizon did not owe\n\nthe reciprocal compensation sought.             On Global's federal court\n\nchallenge to the DTE order, the court vacated and remanded the DTE\n\norder, ruling that the DTE could not base its decision on an\n\ninterpretation of the interconnection agreement that was contrary\n\nto the interpretation reached by the RIPUC on that point; its\n\nremand,     however,    also    allowed        that     differences      between\n\nMassachusetts   and    Rhode   Island    law    might    lead   the    DTE   to   a\n\ndifferent    ultimate    outcome    as     to     payment       of    reciprocal\n\ncompensation.   Global NAPs, Inc. v. Verizon New Eng., Inc. (Global\n\nNAPs II), 332 F. Supp. 2d 341, 374-75 (D. Mass. 2004).                Verizon and\n\nthe DTE took this interlocutory appeal.           We reverse and remand to\n\nthe district court for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.1\n\n                                    I.\n\n            The TCA was enacted to \"promote competition and reduce\n\nregulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality\n\n\n     1\n       This case raises different issues than those raised in\nGlobal NAPs, Inc. v. Verizon New England, Inc., 396 F.3d 16 (1st\nCir. 2005); that case revolved around the parties' attempts to\nnegotiate a new interconnection agreement to replace the one at\nissue here. A separate district court case involving an earlier\ninterconnection   agreement   between   Global  and   Verizon   is\ntangentially related for reasons that will become apparent below.\nSee Global NAPs, Inc. v. New Eng. Tel. & Tel. Co. (Global NAPs I),\n226 F. Supp. 2d 279 (D. Mass. 2002).\n\n                                   -3-\n\fservices for American telecommunications consumers.\"             110 Stat. at\n\n56.   One of the overriding aims of the TCA was to introduce\n\ncompetition into the market for local telephone service, which\n\npreviously had been monopolized by state-regulated entities created\n\nafter the break up of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company\n\n(AT&T).     See Verizon Commc'ns. Inc. v. FCC, 535 U.S. 467, 475-76\n\n(2002).   Under the TCA, incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs)\n\n-- that is, the former local phone monopolies -- must allow\n\ncompetitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) to interconnect with\n\ntheir phone networks.        See 47 U.S.C. § 251(c).         Interconnection\n\nallows customers of CLECs to receive calls from, and place calls\n\nto, customers of ILECs.\n\n            The TCA imposes a number of duties on local exchange\n\ncarriers.      See    id.   §§    251-52.    Most   important,   for   present\n\npurposes, is the duty of all local exchange carriers, whether\n\nincumbent or competitive, \"to establish reciprocal compensation\n\narrangements         for    the      transport      and     termination    of\n\ntelecommunications.\"         Id. § 251(b)(5).        As between two local\n\nexchange carriers, a \"reciprocal compensation arrangement\" is \"one\n\nin which each of the two carriers receives compensation from the\n\nother carrier for the transport and termination on each carrier's\n\nnetwork facilities of telecommunications traffic that originates on\n\nthe network facilities of the other carrier.\"             47 C.F.R. § 51.701.\n\nFor example, generally when a customer of local exchange carrier A\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fcalls a customer of local exchange carrier B -- so that B must\n\ncomplete the call -- A must share with B some of the revenues it\n\nreceives    from    its    customer    to     compensate   B    for   use   of   its\n\nfacilities.    See Ill. Bell Tel. Co. v. WorldCom Techs., Inc., 157\n\nF.3d 500, 501 (7th Cir. 1998).                  The FCC has ruled that the\n\nreciprocal compensation obligations under § 251(b)(5) only extend\n\nto traffic that begins and terminates within a local area. See\n\nLocal Competition Provisions in the Telecomms. Act of 1996, 11\n\nF.C.C.R.    15499,    16012-13,      16015-16    (1996)    (subsequent      history\n\nomitted); Pac. Bell v. Pac-West Telecomm Inc., 325 F.3d 1114, 1120\n\n(9th Cir. 2003).\n\n            The    TCA    requires    ILECs    to   negotiate    interconnection\n\nagreements with CLECs to provide the terms of interconnection and\n\n\"fulfill the duties\" enumerated in § 251, including the duty to\n\nestablish     reciprocal      compensation       arrangements.         47    U.S.C.\n\n§ 251(c)(1).       These agreements can be concluded through voluntary\n\nnegotiation or mediation, id. § 252(a), or if these methods fail,\n\nthrough compulsory arbitration, id. § 252(b).                   Alternatively, a\n\nCLEC has the option of adopting one of the ILEC's interconnection\n\nagreements that had been previously approved within that state.\n\nId. § 252(i).        Once the parties finalize their interconnection\n\nagreement, it must be submitted to the relevant state's commission\n\nfor approval.      Id. § 252(e).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f              A long-running battle has ensued over whether ISP-bound\n\ntraffic is \"local telecommunications traffic\" subject to reciprocal\n\ncompensation within the meaning of the TCA.             See, e.g., Bell Atl.\n\nTel. Cos. v. FCC, 206 F.3d 1, 2-3 (D.C. Cir. 2000).                  The debate\n\ncenters around the question of whether ISP traffic \"terminates\" at\n\nan ISP when a user in one state dials into a local ISP and visits\n\na website hosted on a server in another state.               The issue could be\n\nargued both ways.       One could consider such calls to terminate at\n\nthe ISP, with communications between the ISP and the out-of-state\n\nwebsite considered a separate transaction unrelated to the call.\n\nAlternatively, one might consider the call to have terminated in\n\nthe   state    where   the    web   server   is   located.     See   id.   at   5.\n\nGenerally, CLECs like Global tend to have more ISP customers than\n\ndo ILECs like Verizon. Since ISPs receive calls that are generally\n\nmuch longer than voice calls, and do not place calls of their own,\n\ncarriers with more ISP customers will be net beneficiaries of a\n\nreciprocal compensation scheme that includes ISP traffic.                  CLECs\n\nand ILECs, then, have opposing interests.             See id. at 3.\n\n              In 1998, Global and Verizon began negotiations for an\n\ninterconnection agreement in Rhode Island.            Global NAPs II, 332 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 350.             Rather than submitting their dispute over\n\nreciprocal compensation for ISP traffic to arbitration, Verizon and\n\nGlobal agreed to the following compromise provision, § 5.7.2.3, the\n\nlanguage of which is at the heart of the present dispute:\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f     The Parties . . . disagree as to whether . . . \"ISP\n     Traffic\" . . . constitutes Local Traffic as defined\n     herein, and the charges to be assessed in connection with\n     such traffic.      The issue of whether such traffic\n     constitutes    Local   Traffic    on   which   reciprocal\n     compensation mus[t] be paid pursuant to the [TCA] is\n     presently before the FCC in CCB/CPD 97-30 and may be\n     before a court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties\n     agree that the decision of the FCC in that proceeding, or\n     [of] such court, shall determine whether such traffic is\n     Local Traffic (as defined herein) and the charges to be\n     assessed in connection with ISP Traffic. If the FCC or\n     such court determines that ISP Traffic is Local Traffic,\n     as defined herein, or otherwise determines that ISP\n     Traffic is subject to reciprocal compensation, it shall\n     be compensated as Local Traffic under this Agreement\n     unless another compensation scheme is required under such\n     FCC or court determination.     Until resolution of this\n     issue, [Verizon] agrees to pay GNAPS Reciprocal\n     Compensation for ISP traffic . . . . (emphasis added)\n\nContemporaneous   interconnection   agreements   between   Global   and\n\nVerizon in New York, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont contained an\n\nidentical provision.   The Massachusetts interconnection agreement\n\nin effect between the parties at this time did not contain this\n\nprovision.\n\n          On February 26, 1999, the FCC issued its ruling in Docket\n\nNo. CCB/CPD 97-30, the proceeding specifically referred to in\n\n§ 5.7.2.3.2   In this decision, the FCC concluded that ISP-bound\n\ntraffic is \"largely interstate\" and thus did not fall under the\n\nreciprocal compensation duties imposed by 47 U.S.C. § 251.      Local\n\nCompetition Provisions in the Telecomms. Act (Internet Traffic\n\nOrder), 14 F.C.C.R. 3689, 3705-06 (1999).    The FCC suggested that\n\n\n     2\n       The FCC consolidated Docket No. CCB/CPD 97-30 into Docket\nNo. 96-98. Global NAPs II, 332 F. Supp. 2d at 350-51.\n\n                                -7-\n\fits decision \"might cause some state commissions to re-examine\"\n\ntheir decisions \"to the extent that [they] are based on a finding\n\nthat [ISP] traffic terminates at an ISP server.\"              Id. at 3706.   But\n\nthe FCC also stated that it did not intend to \"preclude[] state\n\ncommissions from determining, pursuant to contractual principles or\n\nother    legal     or   equitable        considerations,      that    reciprocal\n\ncompensation is an appropriate interim inter-carrier compensation\n\nrule\" pending final rulemaking by the FCC on such compensation for\n\nISP-traffic.      Id.\n\n               Soon after the FCC issued the Internet Traffic Order,\n\nVerizon stopped making reciprocal compensation payments to Global\n\nunder    the    Rhode   Island    interconnection      agreement      and   other\n\nagreements containing § 5.7.2.3. Global filed a complaint with the\n\nRIPUC under the Rhode Island agreement, contending that it was\n\nentitled to continued payments because the condition for non-\n\npayment -- \"resolution of [the] issue\" -- had not been met: it\n\nargued    that    the   Internet    Traffic    Order    had    left    to   state\n\ncommissions       the   ability     to     determine    whether       reciprocal\n\ncompensation payments were required under \"contractual principles\n\nor other legal or equitable considerations.\" Verizon argued to the\n\ncontrary: that the FCC had effectively resolved the issue in\n\ndeciding that ISP traffic was non-local interstate traffic not\n\nsubject to the reciprocal compensation duties imposed by 47 U.S.C.\n\n§ 251.    The RIPUC agreed with Global and found that the Internet\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fTraffic Order did not resolve the issue of whether \"ISP Traffic\n\nconstitutes 'local traffic' for which reciprocal compensation must\n\nbe paid under the [interconnection agreement].\"          It relied in part\n\non a prior order in which it had held that \"in the absence of a\n\nfederal rule establishing an appropriate interstate mechanism,\" it\n\nhad   \"the    authority   to   resolve   disputes   concerning      reciprocal\n\ncompensation provisions contained in [interconnection agreements].\"\n\nIt appears that at the time, the RIPUC had not yet come to any\n\nconclusion     on   \"whether   ISP   Traffic   is   subject    to   reciprocal\n\ncompensation\"; it had only just \"opened a general inquiry into the\n\nissue.\"      The RIPUC remarkably concluded \"the undisputed fact that\n\n[Global] has filed a complaint against [Verizon] . . . creates a\n\npresumption that the 'issue' has not been resolved.\" Since Verizon\n\ncould not rebut this presumption, RIPUC found that § 5.7.2.3\n\n\"clearly and unambiguously requires [Verizon] to make reciprocal\n\npayments to [Global].\"         Verizon did not contest this ruling, and\n\nresumed reciprocal compensation payments to Global for ISP traffic\n\nin Rhode Island.\n\n              Meanwhile, in Massachusetts, the story developed quite\n\ndifferently.        Global NAPs and Verizon's first interconnection\n\nagreement in Massachusetts was signed in 1997.3               Global NAPs II,\n\n332 F. Supp. 2d at 350.         In October 1998, the DTE ruled that FCC\n\n\n      3\n       In Global NAPs I, the court dealt with the issue of\nreciprocal compensation under this earlier agreement. 226 F. Supp.\n2d at 289-90.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fprecedent bound it to conclude that ISP traffic was subject to\n\nreciprocal compensation.        Id.     But after the FCC issued its\n\nInternet    Traffic   Order,   the    DTE    revisited      its    October   1998\n\ndecision.   In May 1999, the DTE held that as of February 26, 1999,\n\nthe date of the Internet Traffic Order, local exchange carriers in\n\nMassachusetts     were   no    longer       required   to     pay     reciprocal\n\ncompensation for ISP-bound traffic.           Id. at 352.         In this order,\n\nthe DTE referred to the Internet Traffic Order as \"liberating,\"\n\nsince it had previously felt bound by FCC precedent to treat ISP\n\ntraffic as local traffic subject to reciprocal compensation under\n\nthe TCA.4   Id.\n\n            On March 24, 2000, in the first appeal of the Internet\n\nTraffic Order, the D.C. Circuit vacated the Internet Traffic Order\n\nand remanded to the FCC, finding that the FCC's rationale for\n\ntreating ISP-bound traffic as interstate traffic for the purposes\n\nof reciprocal compensation was inadequate. See Bell Atl. Tel. Cos.\n\n206 F.3d at 9.    The D.C. Circuit was to revisit this issue later.\n\n            In the interim, on June 16, 2000, the FCC approved the\n\nmerger of Verizon's predecessors into Verizon.              See Application of\n\nGTE Corp., Transferor, and Bell Atl. Corp., Transferee (Merger\n\nOrder), 15 F.C.C.R. 14032 (2000).            As one of the conditions for\n\n\n     4\n       This May 1999 order was vacated in Global NAPs I, because\nthe DTE had failed to consider whether reciprocal compensation\nmight be required under contract law or other legal or equitable\nprinciples, as the Internet Traffic Order allowed it to do. Global\nNAPs I, 226 F. Supp. 2d at 288-89, 294-95.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fapproval of the merger, the FCC required Verizon to allow a CLEC in\n\nany one state to adopt any of Verizon's interconnection agreements\n\npreviously approved by a different state commission. Id. app. D at\n\n14310; see also 47 U.S.C. § 252(i); 47 C.F.R. § 51.809 (allowing a\n\nCLEC    to   adopt    one    of   an   ILEC's     interconnection      agreements\n\npreviously approved within that state).               The provision containing\n\nthis condition is referred to by the parties and the district court\n\nas \"Paragraph 32.\"         Paragraph 32 included the following language:\n\n\"[Verizon] shall not be obligated to provide pursuant to this\n\nParagraph any interconnection arrangement . . . unless it . . . is\n\nconsistent with the laws and regulatory requirements of . . . the\n\nstate for which the request is made.\"             Merger Order, 15 F.C.C.R. at\n\n14310.\n\n             On July 24, 2000, Global notified Verizon that, pursuant\n\nto     Paragraph     32,    it    wished     to     adopt   the    Rhode   Island\n\ninterconnection       agreement        for    the     parties'      dealings   in\n\nMassachusetts. However, Verizon and Global disagreed as to whether\n\n§ 5.7.2.3 could be adopted under Paragraph 32.                    On November 15,\n\n2000, the parties agreed that, effective back to July 24, 2000,\n\nGlobal could adopt in Massachusetts all provisions of the Rhode\n\nIsland agreement that were consistent with Paragraph 32, thus\n\nreserving Verizon's right to contest the adoption of § 5.7.2.3.\n\nDuring pendency of negotiations between the parties, Verizon did\n\nnot pay Global reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound traffic.\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f          On April 27, 2001, Global filed a complaint with the FCC,\n\nclaiming it was entitled to adopt § 5.7.2.3 and seeking damages\n\nbased on its interpretation of that section. On February 21, 2002,\n\nthe FCC held that Verizon was required to offer the entire Rhode\n\nIsland agreement, including § 5.7.2.3, to Global in Massachusetts.\n\nSee Global NAPs, Inc. (Paragraph 32 Order), 17 F.C.C.R. 4031, 4039\n\n(2002).   Importantly, it also noted that under the terms of\n\nParagraph 32, \"only the relevant state commission may ultimately\n\ndecide whether particular terms of the agreement should be adopted\n\nin that state, and if so, what those terms mean.\"            Id. at 2039\n\n(emphasis added).     The FCC also held that Global's damages claim\n\nwas   \"premature\"     because   the   DTE   had   yet   to   approve   an\n\ninterconnection agreement between the parties that contained the\n\ncontested provision.     Id. at 2040.\n\n          In the meantime, the FCC issued an order in response to\n\nthe D.C. Circuit's remand of the Internet Traffic Order. See Local\n\nCompetition Provisions in the Telecomms. Act of 1996 (Order on\n\nRemand), 16 F.C.C.R. 9151 (2001).       In the Order on Remand, the FCC\n\nheld once again that the \"provisions of section 251(b)(5) do not\n\nextend to ISP-bound traffic\" but rested its decision on different\n\nlegal grounds.      Id. at 9153.   In addition, the FCC set up a new\n\ncompensation scheme for ISP-bound traffic, which would become\n\neffective starting June 14, 2001.       The FCC also made clear that it\n\nhad exclusive regulatory authority to address the issue, so that\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fstate commissions no longer have the power to do the same.               Id. at\n\n9168-69, 9189.       In its consideration of the Order on Remand, the\n\nD.C. Circuit held that the FCC could not validly base its actions\n\non the new legal grounds.          See WorldCom, Inc. v. FCC, 288 F.3d 429,\n\n433-34 (D.C. Cir. 2002).             It did not vacate the FCC order, but\n\nfound the agency needed to provide a different rationale.               Id. at\n\n434.       The result is that the Order on Remand still remains in\n\nforce.      See Verizon Md. Inc. v. Global NAPs, Inc., 377 F.3d 355,\n\n367 (4th Cir. 2004).\n\n              Thus, the parties here agree that the Order on Remand\n\n\"resolved\" the question of reciprocal compensation for ISP traffic\n\nby setting up a new compensation scheme from June 14, 2001 going\n\nforward.5      But in Massachusetts there remains the question of\n\nreciprocal compensation for ISP-bound traffic between July 24, 2000\n\n(when the language of the Rhode Island agreement went into effect\n\nin     Massachusetts       through    the      Massachusetts   interconnection\n\nagreement) and June 14, 2001 (when the alternative compensation\n\nscheme in the Order on Remand went into effect).               See Global NAPs\n\nII, 332 F. Supp. 2d at 355.\n\n              In   March   2002,     Verizon    submitted   the   Massachusetts\n\ninterconnection agreement containing terms identical to those in\n\nthe Rhode Island agreement for retrospective approval by the DTE.\n\n\n\n       5\n       There is no dispute in Rhode Island that this is the effect\nof the Order on Remand.\n\n                                        -13-\n\fBefore the DTE, Global argued that since it and Verizon had fully\n\nlitigated the issue of whether the Internet Traffic Order was\n\n\"resolution of this issue\" under the identically worded Rhode\n\nIsland    agreement    before    the   RIPUC,       the    DTE   was     collaterally\n\nestopped from relitigating the same.                The DTE rejected Global's\n\nargument.       The DTE approved the Massachusetts agreement in its\n\nentirety on June 24, 2002, but held that it was not bound by\n\nRIPUC's interpretation and reached its own interpretation.                          It\n\nnoted    that   Paragraph   32   allowed      the    DTE    to   ensure     that   the\n\nagreement was \"consistent with the laws and regulatory requirements\n\nof . . . the state for which the request is made.\"                     The DTE made\n\nnote of its prior precedent -- in particular, its May 1999 order\n\nfinding that the Internet Traffic Order had held that ISP traffic\n\nwas   interstate      traffic    and   thus    not        subject   to    reciprocal\n\ncompensation under the TCA.         The DTE concluded that based on this\n\nprecedent it was required to find that the Internet Traffic Order\n\nwas resolution of the issue under the meaning of § 5.7.2.3.\n\nTherefore, Global was not entitled to reciprocal compensation for\n\nISP-bound traffic during the relevant time period, between July 14,\n\n2000 and June 14, 2001.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\f          Global filed suit challenging the DTE ruling.6      Global\n\nasserted a number of claims in its complaint, including, most\n\nimportantly for our review, a claim that the DTE's decision not to\n\nbe bound by the RIPUC decision on the issue violated the Full Faith\n\nand Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution.      See Global NAPs II,\n\n332 F. Supp. 2d at 359.    The district court issued a lengthy and\n\nthoughtful decision on August 26, 2004, granting in part Global's\n\nmotion for summary judgment.     Id. at 375.    The court found the\n\nRIPUC conclusion regarding the effect of the Internet Traffic Order\n\non § 5.7.2.3 could not be relitigated before the DTE.    Id. at 345.\n\nThe court noted, however, that it was \"possible that, in view of\n\nthe state of the law in Rhode Island in 1999, the issue was not\n\nresolved, but, in view of the state of the law in Massachusetts,\n\nthe issue was resolved.\"   Id. at 374.   Thus, the court remanded the\n\ncase to the DTE to determine \"whether and when Massachusetts state\n\nlegal or equitable principles that might serve as the foundation of\n\nany obligation to pay reciprocal compensation were so well-settled\n\nthat the issue was resolved within the meaning of the parties'\n\n\n\n\n     6\n        Global also petitioned the DTE for reconsideration of its\norder since the court in Global NAPs I had subsequently vacated the\nDTE's May 1999 order, which the DTE had relied on heavily when\ninterpreting the interconnection agreement here. The DTE denied\nthis petition, and Global filed a second suit seeking review of\nthis denial. The district court in this case allowed the joint\nmotion of all parties to consolidate the two cases. See Global\nNAPs II, 332 F. Supp. 2d at 343.\n\n                                -15-\n\fagreement through a combination of the [Internet Traffic Order] and\n\nMassachusetts state law.\"   Id. at 345-46.\n\n           Verizon and the DTE each appealed, arguing that the\n\ndistrict court incorrectly applied the Full Faith and Credit\n\nClause.    Global cross-appealed, claiming that the district court\n\nerred in remanding the case to the DTE rather than reversing the\n\nDTE decision outright.\n\n           We first address the question of appellate jurisdiction.\n\n                                 II.\n\n           While neither party challenges jurisdiction, \"[w]e have\n\nan obligation to inquire sua sponte into our jurisdiction over the\n\nmatter.\"   Doyle v. Huntress, Inc., 419 F.3d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(citing Florio v. Olson, 129 F.3d 678, 680 (1st Cir. 1997)).7    It\n\nis clear that \"the federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction\n\nto review state agency determinations under the TCA for compliance\n\nwith federal law, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\"      Global NAPs,\n\nInc. v. Verizon New Eng., Inc., 396 F.3d 16, 21-22 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nHowever, subject to a few exceptions not applicable here, we have\n\nappellate jurisdiction only over \"final decisions\" of the district\n\ncourts under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.    Generally, a district court order\n\n\n     7\n        Shortly after Verizon and the DTE filed this appeal, we\nissued an Order to Show Cause directing the parties to address the\nissue of our appellate jurisdiction in light of the district\ncourt's remand order. In a later order, we referred the issue of\nappellate jurisdiction to the panel, and asked the parties to\naddress certain jurisdictional questions in their opening briefs.\nVerizon and DTE responded to our request, while Global did not.\n\n                                 -16-\n\fthat remands to an administrative agency for further proceedings is\n\nnot considered a \"final decision\" within the meaning of § 1291.\n\nSee Mall Props., Inc. v. Marsh, 841 F.2d 440, 441-42 (1st Cir.\n\n1988).   Here we are faced with a remand order.\n\n             Verizon and the DTE argue that we nonetheless have\n\njurisdiction over this appeal because it falls in the \"category of\n\ncases in which an immediate appeal by a governmental agency is\n\nallowed . . . , because otherwise the [agency] would be unlikely to\n\nobtain review.\"     Colon v. Sec'y of Health & Human Servs., 877 F.2d\n\n148,   151   (1st   Cir.   1989);   see    also   Marsh,   841    F.2d   at   443\n\n(suggesting    jurisdiction    would      be   appropriate   in   cases   where\n\n\"unless review [is] accorded immediately, the agency likely would\n\nnot be able to obtain review\").\n\n             This court has recognized our ability to review orders\n\nremanding agency proceedings in situations similar to this one.\n\nSee Colon, 877 F.2d at 151-52; United States v. Alcon Labs., 636\n\nF.2d 876, 884-85 (1st Cir. 1981); Lopez Lopez v. Sec'y of Health,\n\nEduc. & Welfare, 512 F.2d 1155, 1156 (1st Cir. 1975).\n\n             For example, in Colon, the district court had remanded a\n\nsocial security disability insurance benefits case to the Secretary\n\nof Health and Human Services, ordering him to reopen an earlier\n\ndecision that had denied benefits.             Colon, 877 F.2d at 151. The\n\nSecretary appealed that order.            We found that we had appellate\n\njurisdiction because otherwise \"the Secretary [was] unlikely to\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fobtain review of this important issue which is distinct from the\n\nunderlying merits of the claim of disability.\"             Id.    We noted that\n\nif the Secretary decided to grant benefits on remand, it would be\n\n\"doubtful whether the Secretary could then appeal from his own\n\ndecision to grant benefits.\"        Id.    Even if the Secretary decided to\n\ndeny    benefits,      \"[a]rguing   that    the    district      court   has   no\n\njurisdiction to order the Secretary to reopen a previous final\n\ndecision after that decision, in fact, has been reopened is largely\n\nan academic exercise.\"       Id. at 152.\n\n            Similarly, the Eleventh Circuit, in considering a TCA\n\ncase, held that it had jurisdiction to consider the appeal by the\n\nFlorida Public Service Commission and BellSouth of a district\n\ncourt's order remanding the case to the state commission:\n\n       [T]here is a widely recognized distinction between\n       remands where a district court simply orders the agency\n       to proceed under a 'certain legal standard,' and in\n       situations where a district court remands for further\n       consideration of evidence. A remand order generally is\n       found appealable in the former cases because the agency,\n       forced to conform its decision to the district court's\n       mandate, cannot appeal its own subsequent order.\n\nMCI Telecomms. Corp. v. BellSouth Telecomms. Inc., 298 F.3d 1269,\n\n1271    (11th   Cir.     2002)   (internal     citation    omitted)      (citing\n\nOccidental Petroleum Corp. v. SEC, 873 F.2d 325, 329–30 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1989)).     Other   circuits     considering      an   appeal    under   the   TCA\n\nchallenging a district court order that had remanded to a state\n\ncommission seem to have assumed they had jurisdiction sub silentio.\n\nSee, e.g., Ind. Bell Tel. Co. v. McCarty, 362 F.3d 378, 382, 395\n\n                                     -18-\n\f(7th Cir. 2004); Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 348 F.3d\n\n482, 485, 487 (5th Cir. 2003); US W. Commc'ns, Inc. v. Jennings,\n\n304 F.3d 950, 959 (9th Cir. 2002); MCI Telecomm. Corp. v. Bell\n\nAtl.-Pa., 271 F.3d 491, 498, 521 (3d Cir. 2001); AT&T Commc'ns of\n\nthe S. States, Inc. v. BellSouth Telecomms. Inc., 229 F.3d 457, 459\n\n(4th Cir. 2000).\n\n            For reasons similar to those given in Colon, we hold we\n\nhave appellate jurisdiction over this matter. The circumstances of\n\nthis case make clear that if review is denied at this stage, the\n\nDTE will be unable to \"obtain review of this important issue\n\ndistinct from the underlying merits of the claim of disability,\"\n\nsee Colon, 877 F.2d at 150, because the district court has \"simply\n\norder[ed] the agency to proceed under a certain legal standard,\"\n\nMCI   Telecomms.,    298    F.3d   at   1271    (internal      quotation   marks\n\nomitted).    If on remand from the district court, the DTE were to\n\nreverse     course   and    find    that   Global        was   due   reciprocal\n\ncompensation, the DTE would be unable to appeal its own order for\n\nthe purpose of raising the issue raised here.              Even if one of the\n\nparties appealed this hypothetical later decision, the DTE would be\n\nplaced in the awkward position of challenging the district court's\n\noriginal decision, while simultaneously defending its subsequent\n\norder     applying    the     district         court's     legal     standards.\n\nAlternatively, if the DTE once again denies Global's claim for\n\nreciprocal compensation, and Global were to once again appeal this\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fdetermination, the DTE's appeal of the district court's original\n\nruling would be \"largely an academic exercise of little practical\n\nsignificance.\"    See Colon, 877 F.2d at 152.    In this scenario, the\n\nmost salient issue on appeal would instead be whether the DTE's\n\nalternative grounds were sufficient to support its decision.\n\n           Since we have jurisdiction over DTE's appeal, we may also\n\nhear Verizon's appeal raising the same issue.      See MCI Telecomms.,\n\n298 F.3d at 1271 (hearing appeal of both the state commission and\n\na private party); NAACP v. U.S. Sugar Corp., 84 F.3d 1432, 1436\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1996) (\"[W]hat matters for the purposes of our appellate\n\njurisdiction is whether the district court's decision -- and not\n\nany particular party challenging it -- is properly before us . . .\n\n.\").\n\n           Global's cross-appeal is a different matter.          Global\n\nargues that the district court erred in ordering a remand to the\n\nDTE rather than reversing the DTE's decision outright.             In a\n\nnutshell, Global's argument is that the DTE is constrained by its\n\nown    administrative   precedent     from   finding   that   reciprocal\n\ncompensation cannot be paid.        These arguments go to the heart of\n\nthe underlying debate between Global and Verizon, and in making\n\nthese arguments Global asks us to reach issues not decided by the\n\ndistrict court.   We decline to do so, and find that Global's cross-\n\nappeal is not properly before us.\n\n\n\n\n                                -20-\n\f                                III.\n\n            We turn now to the merits of the appeal.    The district\n\ncourt held:\n\n     [A] state public utility commission's conclusions of\n     state law relating to an interconnection agreement are\n     entitled to preclusive effect in subsequent proceedings\n     before other states' public utility commissions to the\n     same extent that they would receive preclusive effect in\n     the first state's courts.\n\nGlobal NAPs II, 332 F. Supp. 2d at 366.      It implicitly held that\n\nRhode Island law would require the DTE to be bound by the RIPUC's\n\ndecision.   The district court based its decision on its view that\n\nprinciples of collateral estoppel, or \"issue preclusion,\" rooted in\n\nthe Full Faith and Credit Clause required such a holding.    See AVX\n\nCorp. v. Cabot Corp., No. 04-2656, slip op. at 6 (1st Cir. Sept.\n\n13, 2005) (describing the difference between issue and claim\n\npreclusion).   We review this conclusion of federal law de novo.\n\n            The Full Faith and Credit Clause provides: \"Full Faith\n\nand Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts,\n\nRecords, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.      And the\n\nCongress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such\n\nActs, Records, and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect\n\nthereof.\"   U.S. Const. art IV, § 1.   Congress, exercising its power\n\nunder this provision, passed 28 U.S.C. § 1738, which provides that\n\nthe \"Acts, records and judicial proceedings . . . [of any State]\n\nshall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the\n\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fUnited States . . . as they have by law or usage in the courts of\n\n[the] State . . . from which they are taken.\"\n\n             There is no claim that the Full Faith and Credit Clause\n\ncompels full faith and credit be given to the unreviewed decisions\n\nof   state   administrative   agencies.     And,   under   University   of\n\nTennessee v. Elliott, 478 U.S. 788 (1986), the statute, § 1738,\n\ndoes not apply to unreviewed decisions of state administrative\n\nagencies.     However, Supreme Court precedent makes clear that we\n\nmust determine whether application of a federal common law rule of\n\nissue preclusion is appropriate here.\n\n             To set the scene, we describe briefly the requirements of\n\nfederal issue preclusion law, but do not rest on that ground.           We\n\nalso assume arguendo that issue preclusion applies to an unreviewed\n\nadministrative agency proceeding.8        See Bath Iron Works Corp. v.\n\nDir., Office of Workers' Comp., 125 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(\"[T]he subject [of preclusion in administrative contexts] is a\n\n\n\n\n      8\n       The courts generally \"favor[] application of the common-law\ndoctrines of collateral estoppel (as to issues) and res judicata\n(as to claims) to those determinations of administrative bodies\nthat have attained finality.\" Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v.\nSolimino, 501 U.S. 104, 107 (1991). This is true even \"when the\nissue has been decided by an administrative agency, be it state or\nfederal, which acts in a judicial capacity.\" Id. at 108 (citation\nomitted) (citing Elliott, 478 U.S. at 798); see also United States\nv. Utah Constr. & Mining Co., 384 U.S. 394, 422 (1996) (\"When an\nadministrative agency is acting in a judicial capacity and\nresolve[s] disputed issues of fact properly before it which the\nparties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate, the courts\nhave not hesitated to apply res judicata to enforce repose.\").\n\n                                  -22-\n\fcomplex one, with many variations; and it is perhaps well not to\n\ngeneralize too broadly.\").9\n\n          In Monarch Life Insurance Co. v. Ropes & Gray, 65 F.3d\n\n973 (1st Cir. 1995) this court set forth the following \"federal\n\npreclusion principles\": \"(1) both the . . . proceedings involved\n\nthe same issue of law or fact; (2) the parties actually litigated\n\nthe issue in the [prior] proceeding[]; (3) the [first] court\n\nactually resolved the issue in a final and binding judgment . . .\n\n; and (4) its resolution of that issue of law or fact was essential\n\nto its judgment (i.e., necessary to its holding).\"      Id. at 978\n\n(emphases in original); see also In re Bankvest Capital Corp., 375\n\nF.3d 51, 70 (1st Cir. 2004).   We have serious doubts about whether\n\nthis test could be met on the facts presented here, because it is\n\nnot at all clear that the RIPUC and the DTE decided \"the same issue\n\nof law or fact.\"10   The RIPUC here came to the conclusion that\n\n\n     9\n       See also 18B C. Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper, Federal\nPractice and Procedure § 4475, at 474-75 (2d ed. 2002) (\"Preclusion\nis much less likely to attach when a proceeding in one agency is\nfollowed by a proceeding in another agency. . . . When the agencies\nare creatures of different governments, all of the principles that\ngenerally prevent one government from precluding another are at\nwork.\").\n     10\n       There is considerable debate among the parties as to whether\nthe \"issue\" decided by the RIPUC was one of fact, law, or a mixed\nquestion of fact or law.    Verizon and the DTE argue that issue\npreclusion is inappropriate when the issue decided by the first\nstate administrative agency was one of law rather than fact. See\nEdmunson v. Borough of Kennett Square, 4 F.3d 186, 193 (3d Cir.\n1993). Global argues that the issue is one of fact and so Edmunson\nis inapposite, and in the alternative, that even if the issue were\none of law, issue preclusion should apply. The district court came\n\n                                -23-\n\ffederal law (viz, the Internet Traffic Order) did not \"resolve\" the\n\nissue within the meaning of the parties' Rhode Island agreement,\n\nrelying   at   least   in    part   on   the    fact    that   the   question   of\n\nreciprocal compensation was still open in Rhode Island.                 The DTE,\n\nin contrast, found that the Internet Traffic Order did resolve the\n\nissue, but based its finding on its \"well established position on\n\nthe issue of reciprocal compensation.\"                 Indeed, as of May 1999,\n\nafter the Internet Traffic Order had \"liberat[ed]\" it from its\n\nearlier   assumption        that    federal      law      required    reciprocal\n\ncompensation,    the   DTE    had   come   to   a   settled    conclusion   that\n\nreciprocal compensation was not required.11\n\n           It is against the backdrop of its May 1999 order that the\n\nDTE decided the present question of whether the FCC's Internet\n\nTraffic Order \"resolved\" the issue of reciprocal compensation for\n\nISP-bound traffic.     No similar \"well-established position\" guided\n\n\n\nto the conclusion that the RIPUC decided an issue of law, but held\nthat issue preclusion was required. Global NAPs II, 332 F. Supp.\n2d at 366 (citing Miller v. County of Santa Cruz, 39 F.3d 1030,\n1037 & n.7 (9th Cir. 1994)).     We do not resolve the parties'\ndisagreement about whether the DTE ruling is one of law or of fact\nor of mixed law and fact.\n     11\n        The fact that the DTE's May 1999 order was subsequently\nvacated and remanded in Global NAPs I, is of no import. The\ndistrict court in Global NAPs I simply remanded to the agency to\nconsider whether reciprocal compensation would be required under\nstate contractual or equitable principles. The DTE concluded that\ncompensation would not be required, and this decision was upheld\nupon review by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.\nSee MCI WorldCom Commc'ns, Inc. v. Dep't of Telecomms. and Energy,\n810 N.E.2d 802, 812 (Mass. 2004).\n\n                                     -24-\n\fthe RIPUC in making its decision.            It is difficult, then, to see\n\nfor preclusion purposes why the DTE and RIPUC decided the \"same\n\nissue of law or fact.\"        See 18C C. Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper,\n\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 4425, at 659 (2d ed. 2002)\n\n(\"Preclusion . . . may be defeated by showing . . . that there has\n\nbeen a substantial change in the legal climate suggesting a new\n\nunderstanding of the governing legal rules that may require a\n\ndifferent application.\").12\n\n            Nonetheless, we do not rest on this ground because there\n\nis of necessity a prior analysis.       As the Supreme Court made clear\n\nin Elliott, we must first answer the preliminary question of\n\nwhether    application   of    a   federal    common   law   rule   of   issue\n\npreclusion would be consistent with Congress's intent in enacting\n\nthe TCA.    Elliott, 478 U.S. at 796; see also Astoria Fed. Sav. &\n\nLoan Ass'n v. Solimino, 501 U.S. 104, 110 (1991).            We find that, on\n\nthe facts of this case, it would not.\n\n            Elliott controls the structure of analysis.          In Elliott,\n\na discharged employee of the university had filed a complaint with\n\na state administrative agency, claiming his discharge was racially\n\n\n\n     12\n       Courts should be particularly cautious about enforcing issue\npreclusion rules across state lines because in contrast to the\nrules of claim preclusion, \"[m]any issue preclusion rules fall far\noutside the central role of judicial finality.\" 18B C. Wright, A.\nMiller & E. Cooper, supra, § 4467, at 42.          There are many\nsituations where full faith and credit does not compel issue\npreclusion rules to be applied in the second state. Id. § 4467, at\n42-43.\n\n                                    -25-\n\fmotivated.    478 U.S. at 790.         When his claims were denied by the\n\nstate agency, rather than seeking review in the state courts, the\n\nemployee went to federal district court with claims under Title VII\n\nof   the   Civil   Rights   Act   of   1964,    the   Constitution,   and   the\n\nReconstruction-era civil rights statutes.             Id.   The district court\n\ngranted summary judgment for the university on the ground that the\n\nstate administrative decision was entitled to preclusive effect.\n\nId. at 792.    The Supreme Court noted first that the full faith and\n\ncredit statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1738, did not apply to unreviewed\n\nadministrative factfinding.        Id. at 794.        As a result, the Court\n\nhad to \"fashion federal common-law rules of preclusion in the\n\nabsence of a governing statute.\"              Id.   It determined that, with\n\nrespect to the employee's Title VII claim, the question of whether\n\nthe state administrative decision was entitled to preclusive effect\n\ndepended on \"whether a common-law rule of preclusion would be\n\nconsistent with Congress'[s] intent in enacting Title VII.\" Id. at\n\n796.   The Court concluded based on the language and legislative\n\nhistory of Title VII that \"Congress did not intend unreviewed state\n\nadministrative proceedings to have preclusive effect on Title VII\n\nclaims.\"    Id.; see also Solimino, 501 U.S. at 112-13 (holding that\n\nunreviewed findings of a state administrative agency with respect\n\nto an age discrimination claim had no preclusive effect on federal\n\nproceedings under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act).                 In\n\n\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fresolving the present dispute, we ask the same question as to\n\ncongressional intent in enacting the TCA.\n\n           The district court distinguished Elliott and Solimino\n\nbecause \"[a]s they involved decisions to be made by the federal\n\ngovernment, rather than a state, they were governed by the common\n\nlaw of issue preclusion rather than the Full Faith and Credit\n\nClause.\"   Id. at 366.     However, there is nothing in those cases to\n\nsuggest that their holdings on the preclusive reach of judicially\n\nunreviewed decisions of state agencies were limited to situations\n\nwhere the subsequent case was in federal court.\n\n           In order to find that issue preclusion applies, the\n\ndistrict court held that \"there is nothing explicit or implicit in\n\nthe [TCA] that indicates that Congress intended to depart from the\n\ntraditional   rules   of   preclusion.\"          Id.   We    disagree.     Our\n\nexamination   of   the   TCA   leads   us   to    conclude    that   to   apply\n\nprinciples of issue preclusion, at least in the situation presented\n\nhere, would contravene the intent of Congress.\n\n           In a sense, issue preclusion rules are about allocation\n\nof authority to decide a question.           General application of the\n\nfederal common law of issue preclusion would threaten two different\n\nallocations of power under the TCA: the allocation among the\n\ncommissions of each state as to the effectuation of their state's\n\npolicies and the allocation of power between the FCC and the\n\nstates.\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\f           The model under the TCA is to divide authority among the\n\nFCC and the state commissions in an unusual regime of \"cooperative\n\nfederalism,\" see P.R. Tel. Co. v. Telecomms. Regulatory Bd., 189\n\nF.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1999), with the intended effect of leaving\n\nstate commissions free, where warranted, to reflect the policy\n\nchoices made by their states.               See P. Huber et al., Federal\n\nTelecommunications Law §§ 3.3.3-3.3.4 (2d ed. 1999).                  Rather than\n\nplacing the entire scope of regulatory authority in the federal\n\ngovernment, \"Congress enlisted the aid of state public utility\n\ncommissions to ensure that local competition was implemented fairly\n\nand with due regard to the local conditions and the particular\n\nhistorical    circumstances       of    local    regulation   under    the   prior\n\nregime.\"     Id. § 3.3.4, at 227.              We see little indication that\n\nCongress intended its explicit allocation of authority between\n\nstate commissions to be generally displaced by common law rules\n\nthat themselves allocate authority.\n\n           The goal of preserving a role for the state regulatory\n\ncommissions is reflected in a number of provisions in the TCA.\n\nCongress expressly left with the states the power to enforce \"any\n\nregulation, order, or policy of a State commission that . . .\n\nestablishes    access   and       interconnection      obligations      of   local\n\nexchange carriers; . . . is consistent with the requirements of\n\nthis   section;   and   .     .     .    does    not   substantially     prevent\n\nimplementation of the requirements of this section and the purposes\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\fof this part.\"        47 U.S.C. § 251(d)(3).                   While the TCA prevents\n\nstates and localities from passing laws \"hav[ing] the effect of\n\nprohibiting the ability of any entity to provide interstate or\n\nintrastate telecommunications service,\" id. § 253(a), it allows \"a\n\nState    to   impose,      on   a    competitively           neutral    basis    .   .    .    ,\n\nrequirements necessary to preserve and advance universal service,\n\nprotect the public safety and welfare, ensure the continued quality\n\nof   telecommunications         services,            and    safeguard    the    rights        of\n\nconsumers,\" id. § 253(b).\n\n              The   role    played       by    state       commissions    is    especially\n\nimportant     with    respect       to     interconnection        agreements.            State\n\ncommissions are given the authority to resolve though arbitration\n\nor     mediation     any    open      issues         in    ongoing     negotiations       for\n\ninterconnection        agreements.            Id.     §     252(a)(2).          Before        an\n\ninterconnection agreement goes into effect, it must be approved by\n\na state commission, which may reject the agreement if it \"is not\n\nconsistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity\" or\n\nit \"discriminates against a telecommunications carrier not a party\n\nto the agreement.\"         Id. § 252(e)(2).               Congress expressly preserved\n\neach     state's     authority        to      \"establish[]       or     enforc[e]        other\n\nrequirements of State law in [a State commission's] review of an\n\nagreement,      including           requiring         compliance       with     intrastate\n\ntelecommunications service quality standards or requirements\" as\n\n\n\n\n                                              -29-\n\flong as those requirements do not serve as barriers to entry.                         Id.\n\n§ 252(e)(3).\n\n               In addition to threatening the allocation of authority\n\nunder the TCA among the states as to protection of their own state\n\ninterests, general implementation of default common law issue\n\npreclusion rules could threaten the authority allocated to the FCC.\n\nCongress gave the federal government an extensive oversight role.\n\nUnder the TCA, the FCC has authority to preempt state jurisdiction\n\nover    regulation     of    intrastate     communications        in   a    number     of\n\nspecific situations.          For example, if a state commission fails to\n\ncarry    out    the    duties     required       of   it   with   respect       to    its\n\nconsideration of a particular interconnection agreement, the FCC is\n\ngiven authority to preempt the state commission's jurisdiction and\n\nassume direct responsibility for that agreement.                  Id. § 252(e)(5).\n\nDirect    review      of    the   state   commission's       failure       to   act    is\n\nforeclosed; the FCC's actions in response to an alleged failure to\n\nact, and judicial review of those actions, are the \"exclusive\n\nremedies.\" Id. § 252(e)(6).           In addition, the FCC may preempt the\n\nenforcement of a state or local law if it finds, after notice and\n\nan opportunity for comment, that the law acts as a barrier to\n\nentry.    Id. § 253(e).           In addition to these specific grants of\n\nauthority, the FCC has broad regulatory authority over the TCA.\n\nSee id. § 201(b) (\"The Commission may prescribe such rules and\n\nregulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out\n\n\n                                          -30-\n\fthe provisions of this chapter.\"); AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utils. Bd.,\n\n525 U.S. 366, 378 (1999) (interpreting § 201 to extend to the local\n\ncompetition provisions of the TCA).\n\n                Indeed, the FCC has issued its own orders and regulations\n\nthat have made clear that, at times, individual state commissions\n\nare       to   decide    matters     and    that,   at   other    times,       one    state\n\ncommission's determination is owed some deference.                            The FCC, in\n\nexercising the power granted to it under the TCA, has indicated\n\nthat the DTE is the decision-making authority as to the issue here.\n\nIn    Paragraph         32,   the    FCC    noted   that    the        adoption      of    an\n\ninterconnection agreement from another state was subject to the\n\nproviso that the agreement had to be \"consistent with the laws and\n\nregulatory requirements of . . . the state for which the request is\n\nmade.\"         Merger Order, 15 F.C.C.R. 14032 app. D at 14310.                            In\n\nconsidering the agreement here, the FCC reiterated that under the\n\nterms of Paragraph 32 \"only the relevant state commission may\n\nultimately decide whether particular terms of the agreement should\n\nbe adopted in that state, and if so, what those terms mean.\"\n\nParagraph 32 Order, 17 F.C.C.R. at 4039.\n\n                As a result of these orders, the FCC has essentially done\n\nthree things.           It has said that nothing in the TCA itself requires\n\nas    a    matter   of     federal    law    that   Verizon      pay    the    reciprocal\n\ncompensation charges.           It has also said that each state commission\n\nmay make its own determination on the issue under state law.                              And\n\n\n                                            -31-\n\falthough the FCC required Verizon to enter an agreement with Global\n\nusing the same language as the Rhode Island agreement, it also\n\nrecognized that there was a dispute about that language and that\n\nthe relevant state commission (the DTE) should decide the issue.\n\n          For a court to step in and shift the state-by-state\n\ndecision-making authority from the Massachusetts DTE to the RIPUC\n\non this issue would upset the allocations of authority made out\n\nunder the TCA.      A judicially imposed rule of preclusion here would\n\nalso set up an opportunity for regulatory arbitrage contrary to the\n\npurposes of the TCA.     It is common in the telecommunications world\n\nfor   ILECs   and    CLECs   to    negotiate    multiple   interconnection\n\nagreements    across    multiple    states     simultaneously,   and   these\n\nagreements often contain identical terms.          Given this fact, a rule\n\ngranting preclusive effect to the decision of the first state\n\ncommission on a particular issue creates the risk of perverse\n\nincentives.   Carriers looking to lock in a friendly interpretation\n\nwill race to the state commission with the most amenable views, and\n\nperhaps leverage that decision to their advantage in other states.\n\nThe state commissions themselves would be encouraged to decide an\n\nissue as quickly as possible, to preserve their independence and to\n\navoid being bound by another state agency's interpretations of\n\ncontractual terms.      These results cut directly against Congress's\n\ndesire, as evinced by the text and structure of the TCA, \"to ensure\n\nthat local competition [be] implemented fairly and with due regard\n\n\n                                    -32-\n\fto the local conditions and the particular historical circumstances\n\nof local regulation under the prior regime.\"          P. Huber et al.,\n\nsupra, § 3.3.4, at 227.\n\n           To be sure, in some other circumstances, deference by one\n\nstate commission to another state's conclusions may be appropriate.\n\nFor example, the FCC has chosen to give presumptive effect to\n\ncertain findings regarding technical feasibility by one state\n\ncommission.     See 47 C.F.R. § 51.319(b)(3)(ii) (\"Once one state\n\ncommission has determined that it is technically feasible to\n\nunbundle subloops at a designated point, an incumbent LEC in any\n\nstate   shall   have   the   burden   of   demonstrating   to   the   state\n\ncommission . . . that it is not technically feasible . . . to\n\nunbundle its own loops at such a point.\"); id. § 51.230(c) (\"Upon\n\na successful demonstration by [a competing] carrier before a\n\nparticular state commission [that 'deployment of a technology falls\n\nwithin the presumption under paragraph (a)(3) of this section'],\n\nthe deployed technology shall be presumed acceptable for deployment\n\nin other areas.\").     This presumption operates not because of the\n\nlaw of issue preclusion but because the FCC has chosen this as an\n\nappropriate method of achieving uniformity.            The FCC has not\n\ncreated any similar presumptions as to the issues presented here.\n\n           In part because of the complications of the TCA's scheme\n\nof cooperative federalism, we do not think it wise to decide this\n\ncase in the broad terms urged by the parties.         We do not address\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\fwhether the enactment of the TCA itself displaced all aspects of\n\nthe federal common law of issue preclusion in the area.                Nor do we\n\naddress   the    extent    to     which    the   TCA   assigns   the   task   of\n\ndisplacement or adoption of rules of issue preclusion to the FCC.\n\nWe also do not resolve the dispute as to whether interconnection\n\nagreements are creatures of state law or federal law.              Rather, we\n\nsimply    find   that     under     the     circumstances   presented     here,\n\napplication of common law principles of issue preclusion would\n\ncontravene the intent of Congress. The district court was in error\n\nwhen it held otherwise.\n\n                                          IV.\n\n           We reverse the district court's judgment and vacate the\n\norder remanding the matter to the DTE; we remand to the district\n\ncourt for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.               Costs\n\nare awarded to Verizon and the DTE.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -34-\n\f",

This case raises a new issue of\n\nimportance under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (TCA), Pub. L.\n\nNo.   104-104,   110   Stat.   56   (codified   as   amended    in   scattered\n\nsections of 47 U.S.C.).        The question is whether the doctrine of\n\nissue preclusion applies so as to bind one state's commission to\n\napply the findings and conclusions of another state's commission in\n\ndisputes between the same parties about the interpretation of\n\nidentical    contract     language     contained     in     different    state\n\ninterconnection agreements.\n\n            The district court concluded that the Full Faith and\n\nCredit Clause compelled application of the doctrine.                 Its order\n\nbound the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy\n\n(DTE),   which   was   interpreting    a    Massachusetts     interconnection\n\nagreement between Global NAPs, Inc. (Global) and Verizon New\n\nEngland, Inc. (Verizon), to follow the earlier decision of the\n\nRhode Island Public Utility Commission (RIPUC) as to the effect of\n\na prior order by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on the\n\nparties' Rhode Island interconnection agreement.                 On de novo\n\nreview, we reverse.     The district court's reasoning is contrary to\n\nthe language of and policies behind the TCA.\n\n            Underlying this legal issue is the question of whether\n\nVerizon owes an estimated $30 to $50 million in payments to Global\n\nas    \"reciprocal   compensation\"     for    calls   placed    by    Verizon's\n\ncustomers to Global's customers connected through an internet\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fservice provider (ISP) in Massachusetts during the period from July\n\n24, 2000 to June 14, 2001.\n\n            The DTE ruled on June 24, 2002 that Verizon did not owe\n\nthe reciprocal compensation sought.             On Global's federal court\n\nchallenge to the DTE order, the court vacated and remanded the DTE\n\norder, ruling that the DTE could not base its decision on an\n\ninterpretation of the interconnection agreement that was contrary\n\nto the interpretation reached by the RIPUC on that point; its\n\nremand,     however,    also    allowed        that     differences      between\n\nMassachusetts   and    Rhode   Island    law    might    lead   the    DTE   to   a\n\ndifferent    ultimate    outcome    as     to     payment       of    reciprocal\n\ncompensation.

One of the overriding aims of the TCA was to introduce\n\ncompetition into the market for local telephone service, which\n\npreviously had been monopolized by state-regulated entities created\n\nafter the break up of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company\n\n(AT&T).

Under the TCA, incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs)\n\n-- that is, the former local phone monopolies -- must allow\n\ncompetitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) to interconnect with\n\ntheir phone networks.        See 47 U.S.C. § 251(c).         Interconnection\n\nallows customers of CLECs to receive calls from, and place calls\n\nto, customers of ILECs.\n\n            The TCA imposes a number of duties on local exchange\n\ncarriers.      See    id.   §§    251-52.    Most   important,   for   present\n\npurposes, is the duty of all local exchange carriers, whether\n\nincumbent or competitive, \"to establish reciprocal compensation\n\narrangements         for    the      transport      and     termination    of\n\ntelecommunications.\"         Id. § 251(b)(5).        As between two local\n\nexchange carriers, a \"reciprocal compensation arrangement\" is \"one\n\nin which each of the two carriers receives compensation from the\n\nother carrier for the transport and termination on each carrier's\n\nnetwork facilities of telecommunications traffic that originates on\n\nthe network facilities of the other carrier.\"             47 C.F.R. § 51.701.\n\nFor example, generally when a customer of local exchange carrier A\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fcalls a customer of local exchange carrier B -- so that B must\n\ncomplete the call -- A must share with B some of the revenues it\n\nreceives    from    its    customer    to     compensate   B    for   use   of   its\n\nfacilities.

See, e.g., Bell Atl.\n\nTel. Cos. v.

Cir. 2000).                  The debate\n\ncenters around the question of whether ISP traffic \"terminates\" at\n\nan ISP when a user in one state dials into a local ISP and visits\n\na website hosted on a server in another state.               The issue could be\n\nargued both ways.       One could consider such calls to terminate at\n\nthe ISP, with communications between the ISP and the out-of-state\n\nwebsite considered a separate transaction unrelated to the call.\n\nAlternatively, one might consider the call to have terminated in\n\nthe   state    where   the    web   server   is   located.     See   id.   at   5.\n\nGenerally, CLECs like Global tend to have more ISP customers than\n\ndo ILECs like Verizon. Since ISPs receive calls that are generally\n\nmuch longer than voice calls, and do not place calls of their own,\n\ncarriers with more ISP customers will be net beneficiaries of a\n\nreciprocal compensation scheme that includes ISP traffic.                  CLECs\n\nand ILECs, then, have opposing interests.             See id. at 3.\n\n              In 1998, Global and Verizon began negotiations for an\n\ninterconnection agreement in Rhode Island.            Global NAPs II, 332 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 350.             Rather than submitting their dispute over\n\nreciprocal compensation for ISP traffic to arbitration, Verizon and\n\nGlobal agreed to the following compromise provision, § 5.7.2.3, the\n\nlanguage of which is at the heart of the present dispute:\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f     The Parties . . . disagree as to whether . . . \"ISP\n     Traffic\" . . . constitutes Local Traffic as defined\n     herein, and the charges to be assessed in connection with\n     such traffic.      The issue of whether such traffic\n     constitutes    Local   Traffic    on   which   reciprocal\n     compensation mus[t] be paid pursuant to the [TCA] is\n     presently before the FCC in CCB/CPD 97-30 and may be\n     before a court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties\n     agree that the decision of the FCC in that proceeding, or\n     [of] such court, shall determine whether such traffic is\n     Local Traffic (as defined herein) and the charges to be\n     assessed in connection with ISP Traffic. If the FCC or\n     such court determines that ISP Traffic is Local Traffic,\n     as defined herein, or otherwise determines that ISP\n     Traffic is subject to reciprocal compensation, it shall\n     be compensated as Local Traffic under this Agreement\n     unless another compensation scheme is required under such\n     FCC or court determination.     Until resolution of this\n     issue, [Verizon] agrees to pay GNAPS Reciprocal\n     Compensation for ISP traffic . . . . (emphasis added)\n\nContemporaneous   interconnection   agreements   between   Global   and\n\nVerizon in New York, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont contained an\n\nidentical provision.   The Massachusetts interconnection agreement\n\nin effect between the parties at this time did not contain this\n\nprovision.\n\n          On February 26, 1999, the FCC issued its ruling in Docket\n\nNo. CCB/CPD 97-30, the proceeding specifically referred to in\n\n§ 5.7.2.3.2   In this decision, the FCC concluded that ISP-bound\n\ntraffic is \"largely interstate\" and thus did not fall under the\n\nreciprocal compensation duties imposed by 47 U.S.C. § 251.      Local\n\nCompetition Provisions in the Telecomms. Act (Internet Traffic\n\nOrder), 14 F.C.C.R. 3689, 3705-06 (1999).    The FCC suggested that\n\n\n     2\n       The FCC consolidated Docket No. CCB/CPD 97-30 into Docket\nNo. 96-98. Global NAPs II, 332 F. Supp. 2d at 350-51.\n\n                                -7-\n\fits decision \"might cause some state commissions to re-examine\"\n\ntheir decisions \"to the extent that [they] are based on a finding\n\nthat [ISP] traffic terminates at an ISP server.\"              Id. at 3706.   But\n\nthe FCC also stated that it did not intend to \"preclude[] state\n\ncommissions from determining, pursuant to contractual principles or\n\nother    legal     or   equitable        considerations,      that    reciprocal\n\ncompensation is an appropriate interim inter-carrier compensation\n\nrule\" pending final rulemaking by the FCC on such compensation for\n\nISP-traffic.      Id.\n\n               Soon after the FCC issued the Internet Traffic Order,\n\nVerizon stopped making reciprocal compensation payments to Global\n\nunder    the    Rhode   Island    interconnection      agreement      and   other\n\nagreements containing § 5.7.2.3. Global filed a complaint with the\n\nRIPUC under the Rhode Island agreement, contending that it was\n\nentitled to continued payments because the condition for non-\n\npayment -- \"resolution of [the] issue\" -- had not been met: it\n\nargued    that    the   Internet    Traffic    Order    had    left    to   state\n\ncommissions       the   ability     to     determine    whether       reciprocal\n\ncompensation payments were required under \"contractual principles\n\nor other legal or equitable considerations.\" Verizon argued to the\n\ncontrary: that the FCC had effectively resolved the issue in\n\ndeciding that ISP traffic was non-local interstate traffic not\n\nsubject to the reciprocal compensation duties imposed by 47 U.S.C.\n\n§ 251.    The RIPUC agreed with Global and found that the Internet\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fTraffic Order did not resolve the issue of whether \"ISP Traffic\n\nconstitutes 'local traffic' for which reciprocal compensation must\n\nbe paid under the [interconnection agreement].\"          It relied in part\n\non a prior order in which it had held that \"in the absence of a\n\nfederal rule establishing an appropriate interstate mechanism,\" it\n\nhad   \"the    authority   to   resolve   disputes   concerning      reciprocal\n\ncompensation provisions contained in [interconnection agreements].\"\n\nIt appears that at the time, the RIPUC had not yet come to any\n\nconclusion     on   \"whether   ISP   Traffic   is   subject    to   reciprocal\n\ncompensation\"; it had only just \"opened a general inquiry into the\n\nissue.\"      The RIPUC remarkably concluded \"the undisputed fact that\n\n[Global] has filed a complaint against [Verizon] . . . creates a\n\npresumption that the 'issue' has not been resolved.\" Since Verizon\n\ncould not rebut this presumption, RIPUC found that § 5.7.2.3\n\n\"clearly and unambiguously requires [Verizon] to make reciprocal\n\npayments to [Global].\"         Verizon did not contest this ruling, and\n\nresumed reciprocal compensation payments to Global for ISP traffic\n\nin Rhode Island.\n\n              Meanwhile, in Massachusetts, the story developed quite\n\ndifferently.        Global NAPs and Verizon's first interconnection\n\nagreement in Massachusetts was signed in 1997.3               Global NAPs II,\n\n332 F. Supp. 2d at 350.         In October 1998, the DTE ruled that FCC\n\n\n      3\n       In Global NAPs I, the court dealt with the issue of\nreciprocal compensation under this earlier agreement. 226 F. Supp.\n2d at 289-90.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fprecedent bound it to conclude that ISP traffic was subject to\n\nreciprocal compensation.        Id.     But after the FCC issued its\n\nInternet    Traffic   Order,   the    DTE    revisited      its    October   1998\n\ndecision.   In May 1999, the DTE held that as of February 26, 1999,\n\nthe date of the Internet Traffic Order, local exchange carriers in\n\nMassachusetts     were   no    longer       required   to     pay     reciprocal\n\ncompensation for ISP-bound traffic.           Id. at 352.         In this order,\n\nthe DTE referred to the Internet Traffic Order as \"liberating,\"\n\nsince it had previously felt bound by FCC precedent to treat ISP\n\ntraffic as local traffic subject to reciprocal compensation under\n\nthe TCA.4   Id.\n\n            On March 24, 2000, in the first appeal of the Internet\n\nTraffic Order, the D.C. Circuit vacated the Internet Traffic Order\n\nand remanded to the FCC, finding that the FCC's rationale for\n\ntreating ISP-bound traffic as interstate traffic for the purposes\n\nof reciprocal compensation was inadequate. See Bell Atl. Tel. Cos.\n\n206 F.3d at 9.    The D.C. Circuit was to revisit this issue later.\n\n            In the interim, on June 16, 2000, the FCC approved the\n\nmerger of Verizon's predecessors into Verizon.              See Application of\n\nGTE Corp., Transferor, and Bell Atl. Corp., Transferee (Merger\n\nOrder), 15 F.C.C.R. 14032 (2000).            As one of the conditions for\n\n\n     4\n       This May 1999 order was vacated in Global NAPs I, because\nthe DTE had failed to consider whether reciprocal compensation\nmight be required under contract law or other legal or equitable\nprinciples, as the Internet Traffic Order allowed it to do. Global\nNAPs I, 226 F. Supp. 2d at 288-89, 294-95.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fapproval of the merger, the FCC required Verizon to allow a CLEC in\n\nany one state to adopt any of Verizon's interconnection agreements\n\npreviously approved by a different state commission. Id. app. D at\n\n14310; see also 47 U.S.C. § 252(i); 47 C.F.R. § 51.809 (allowing a\n\nCLEC    to   adopt    one    of   an   ILEC's     interconnection      agreements\n\npreviously approved within that state).               The provision containing\n\nthis condition is referred to by the parties and the district court\n\nas \"Paragraph 32.\"         Paragraph 32 included the following language:\n\n\"[Verizon] shall not be obligated to provide pursuant to this\n\nParagraph any interconnection arrangement . . . unless it . . . is\n\nconsistent with the laws and regulatory requirements of . . . the\n\nstate for which the request is made.\"             Merger Order, 15 F.C.C.R. at\n\n14310.\n\n             On July 24, 2000, Global notified Verizon that, pursuant\n\nto     Paragraph     32,    it    wished     to     adopt   the    Rhode   Island\n\ninterconnection       agreement        for    the     parties'      dealings   in\n\nMassachusetts. However, Verizon and Global disagreed as to whether\n\n§ 5.7.2.3 could be adopted under Paragraph 32.                    On November 15,\n\n2000, the parties agreed that, effective back to July 24, 2000,\n\nGlobal could adopt in Massachusetts all provisions of the Rhode\n\nIsland agreement that were consistent with Paragraph 32, thus\n\nreserving Verizon's right to contest the adoption of § 5.7.2.3.\n\nDuring pendency of negotiations between the parties, Verizon did\n\nnot pay Global reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound traffic.\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f          On April 27, 2001, Global filed a complaint with the FCC,\n\nclaiming it was entitled to adopt § 5.7.2.3 and seeking damages\n\nbased on its interpretation of that section. On February 21, 2002,\n\nthe FCC held that Verizon was required to offer the entire Rhode\n\nIsland agreement, including § 5.7.2.3, to Global in Massachusetts.\n\nSee Global NAPs, Inc. (Paragraph 32 Order), 17 F.C.C.R. 4031, 4039\n\n(2002).   Importantly, it also noted that under the terms of\n\nParagraph 32, \"only the relevant state commission may ultimately\n\ndecide whether particular terms of the agreement should be adopted\n\nin that state, and if so, what those terms mean.\"            Id. at 2039\n\n(emphasis added).     The FCC also held that Global's damages claim\n\nwas   \"premature\"     because   the   DTE   had   yet   to   approve   an\n\ninterconnection agreement between the parties that contained the\n\ncontested provision.     Id. at 2040.\n\n          In the meantime, the FCC issued an order in response to\n\nthe D.C. Circuit's remand of the Internet Traffic Order. See Local\n\nCompetition Provisions in the Telecomms. Act of 1996 (Order on\n\nRemand), 16 F.C.C.R. 9151 (2001).       In the Order on Remand, the FCC\n\nheld once again that the \"provisions of section 251(b)(5) do not\n\nextend to ISP-bound traffic\" but rested its decision on different\n\nlegal grounds.      Id. at 9153.   In addition, the FCC set up a new\n\ncompensation scheme for ISP-bound traffic, which would become\n\neffective starting June 14, 2001.       The FCC also made clear that it\n\nhad exclusive regulatory authority to address the issue, so that\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fstate commissions no longer have the power to do the same.               Id. at\n\n9168-69, 9189.       In its consideration of the Order on Remand, the\n\nD.C. Circuit held that the FCC could not validly base its actions\n\non the new legal grounds.          See WorldCom, Inc. v.

See Global NAPs\n\nII, 332 F. Supp. 2d at 355.\n\n              In   March   2002,     Verizon    submitted   the   Massachusetts\n\ninterconnection agreement containing terms identical to those in\n\nthe Rhode Island agreement for retrospective approval by the DTE.\n\n\n\n       5\n       There is no dispute in Rhode Island that this is the effect\nof the Order on Remand.\n\n                                        -13-\n\fBefore the DTE, Global argued that since it and Verizon had fully\n\nlitigated the issue of whether the Internet Traffic Order was\n\n\"resolution of this issue\" under the identically worded Rhode\n\nIsland    agreement    before    the   RIPUC,       the    DTE   was     collaterally\n\nestopped from relitigating the same.                The DTE rejected Global's\n\nargument.       The DTE approved the Massachusetts agreement in its\n\nentirety on June 24, 2002, but held that it was not bound by\n\nRIPUC's interpretation and reached its own interpretation.                          It\n\nnoted    that   Paragraph   32   allowed      the    DTE    to   ensure     that   the\n\nagreement was \"consistent with the laws and regulatory requirements\n\nof . . . the state for which the request is made.\"                     The DTE made\n\nnote of its prior precedent -- in particular, its May 1999 order\n\nfinding that the Internet Traffic Order had held that ISP traffic\n\nwas   interstate      traffic    and   thus    not        subject   to    reciprocal\n\ncompensation under the TCA.         The DTE concluded that based on this\n\nprecedent it was required to find that the Internet Traffic Order\n\nwas resolution of the issue under the meaning of § 5.7.2.3.\n\nTherefore, Global was not entitled to reciprocal compensation for\n\nISP-bound traffic during the relevant time period, between July 14,\n\n2000 and June 14, 2001.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\f          Global filed suit challenging the DTE ruling.6      Global\n\nasserted a number of claims in its complaint, including, most\n\nimportantly for our review, a claim that the DTE's decision not to\n\nbe bound by the RIPUC decision on the issue violated the Full Faith\n\nand Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution.      See Global NAPs II,\n\n332 F. Supp. 2d at 359.    The district court issued a lengthy and\n\nthoughtful decision on August 26, 2004, granting in part Global's\n\nmotion for summary judgment.     Id. at 375.    The court found the\n\nRIPUC conclusion regarding the effect of the Internet Traffic Order\n\non § 5.7.2.3 could not be relitigated before the DTE.    Id. at 345.\n\nThe court noted, however, that it was \"possible that, in view of\n\nthe state of the law in Rhode Island in 1999, the issue was not\n\nresolved, but, in view of the state of the law in Massachusetts,\n\nthe issue was resolved.\"   Id. at 374.   Thus, the court remanded the\n\ncase to the DTE to determine \"whether and when Massachusetts state\n\nlegal or equitable principles that might serve as the foundation of\n\nany obligation to pay reciprocal compensation were so well-settled\n\nthat the issue was resolved within the meaning of the parties'\n\n\n\n\n     6\n        Global also petitioned the DTE for reconsideration of its\norder since the court in Global NAPs I had subsequently vacated the\nDTE's May 1999 order, which the DTE had relied on heavily when\ninterpreting the interconnection agreement here. The DTE denied\nthis petition, and Global filed a second suit seeking review of\nthis denial. The district court in this case allowed the joint\nmotion of all parties to consolidate the two cases. See Global\nNAPs II, 332 F. Supp. 2d at 343.\n\n                                -15-\n\fagreement through a combination of the [Internet Traffic Order] and\n\nMassachusetts state law.\"   Id. at 345-46.\n\n           Verizon and the DTE each appealed, arguing that the\n\ndistrict court incorrectly applied the Full Faith and Credit\n\nClause.

The circumstances of\n\nthis case make clear that if review is denied at this stage, the\n\nDTE will be unable to \"obtain review of this important issue\n\ndistinct from the underlying merits of the claim of disability,\"\n\nsee Colon, 877 F.2d at 150, because the district court has \"simply\n\norder[ed] the agency to proceed under a certain legal standard,\"\n\nMCI   Telecomms.,    298    F.3d   at   1271    (internal      quotation   marks\n\nomitted).    If on remand from the district court, the DTE were to\n\nreverse     course   and    find    that   Global        was   due   reciprocal\n\ncompensation, the DTE would be unable to appeal its own order for\n\nthe purpose of raising the issue raised here.              Even if one of the\n\nparties appealed this hypothetical later decision, the DTE would be\n\nplaced in the awkward position of challenging the district court's\n\noriginal decision, while simultaneously defending its subsequent\n\norder     applying    the     district         court's     legal     standards.\n\nAlternatively, if the DTE once again denies Global's claim for\n\nreciprocal compensation, and Global were to once again appeal this\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fdetermination, the DTE's appeal of the district court's original\n\nruling would be \"largely an academic exercise of little practical\n\nsignificance.\"    See Colon, 877 F.2d at 152.    In this scenario, the\n\nmost salient issue on appeal would instead be whether the DTE's\n\nalternative grounds were sufficient to support its decision.\n\n           Since we have jurisdiction over DTE's appeal, we may also\n\nhear Verizon's appeal raising the same issue.      See MCI Telecomms.,\n\n298 F.3d at 1271 (hearing appeal of both the state commission and\n\na private party); NAACP v. U.S. Sugar Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718711\"><a href=\"/opinion/718711/national-association-for-the-advancement-of-colored-people-jefferson/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1436\n\n(D.C.

Global\n\nargues that the district court erred in ordering a remand to the\n\nDTE rather than reversing the DTE's decision outright.             In a\n\nnutshell, Global's argument is that the DTE is constrained by its\n\nown    administrative   precedent     from   finding   that   reciprocal\n\ncompensation cannot be paid.        These arguments go to the heart of\n\nthe underlying debate between Global and Verizon, and in making\n\nthese arguments Global asks us to reach issues not decided by the\n\ndistrict court.   We decline to do so, and find that Global's cross-\n\nappeal is not properly before us.\n\n\n\n\n                                -20-\n\f                                III.\n\n            We turn now to the merits of the appeal.    The district\n\ncourt held:\n\n     [A] state public utility commission's conclusions of\n     state law relating to an interconnection agreement are\n     entitled to preclusive effect in subsequent proceedings\n     before other states' public utility commissions to the\n     same extent that they would receive preclusive effect in\n     the first state's courts.\n\nGlobal NAPs II, 332 F. Supp. 2d at 366.      It implicitly held that\n\nRhode Island law would require the DTE to be bound by the RIPUC's\n\ndecision.   The district court based its decision on its view that\n\nprinciples of collateral estoppel, or \"issue preclusion,\" rooted in\n\nthe Full Faith and Credit Clause required such a holding.    See AVX\n\nCorp. v. Cabot Corp., No. 04-2656, slip op. at 6 (1st Cir. Sept.\n\n13, 2005) (describing the difference between issue and claim\n\npreclusion).   We review this conclusion of federal law de novo.\n\n            The Full Faith and Credit Clause provides: \"Full Faith\n\nand Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts,\n\nRecords, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.      And the\n\nCongress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such\n\nActs, Records, and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect\n\nthereof.\"   U.S. Const. art IV, § 1.   Congress, exercising its power\n\nunder this provision, passed 28 U.S.C. § 1738, which provides that\n\nthe \"Acts, records and judicial proceedings . . .

The DTE,\n\nin contrast, found that the Internet Traffic Order did resolve the\n\nissue, but based its finding on its \"well established position on\n\nthe issue of reciprocal compensation.\"                 Indeed, as of May 1999,\n\nafter the Internet Traffic Order had \"liberat[ed]\" it from its\n\nearlier   assumption        that    federal      law      required    reciprocal\n\ncompensation,    the   DTE    had   come   to   a   settled    conclusion   that\n\nreciprocal compensation was not required.11\n\n           It is against the backdrop of its May 1999 order that the\n\nDTE decided the present question of whether the FCC's Internet\n\nTraffic Order \"resolved\" the issue of reciprocal compensation for\n\nISP-bound traffic.     No similar \"well-established position\" guided\n\n\n\nto the conclusion that the RIPUC decided an issue of law, but held\nthat issue preclusion was required. Global NAPs II, 332 F.

When his claims were denied by the\n\nstate agency, rather than seeking review in the state courts, the\n\nemployee went to federal district court with claims under Title VII\n\nof   the   Civil   Rights   Act   of   1964,    the   Constitution,   and   the\n\nReconstruction-era civil rights statutes.             Id.   The district court\n\ngranted summary judgment for the university on the ground that the\n\nstate administrative decision was entitled to preclusive effect.\n\nId. at 792.    The Supreme Court noted first that the full faith and\n\ncredit statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1738, did not apply to unreviewed\n\nadministrative factfinding.        Id. at 794.        As a result, the Court\n\nhad to \"fashion federal common-law rules of preclusion in the\n\nabsence of a governing statute.\"              Id.   It determined that, with\n\nrespect to the employee's Title VII claim, the question of whether\n\nthe state administrative decision was entitled to preclusive effect\n\ndepended on \"whether a common-law rule of preclusion would be\n\nconsistent with Congress'[s] intent in enacting Title VII.\" Id. at\n\n796.   The Court concluded based on the language and legislative\n\nhistory of Title VII that \"Congress did not intend unreviewed state\n\nadministrative proceedings to have preclusive effect on Title VII\n\nclaims.\"    Id.; see also Solimino, 501 U.S. at 112-13 (holding that\n\nunreviewed findings of a state administrative agency with respect\n\nto an age discrimination claim had no preclusive effect on federal\n\nproceedings under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act).                 In\n\n\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fresolving the present dispute, we ask the same question as to\n\ncongressional intent in enacting the TCA.\n\n           The district court distinguished Elliott and Solimino\n\nbecause \"[a]s they involved decisions to be made by the federal\n\ngovernment, rather than a state, they were governed by the common\n\nlaw of issue preclusion rather than the Full Faith and Credit\n\nClause.\"   Id. at 366.     However, there is nothing in those cases to\n\nsuggest that their holdings on the preclusive reach of judicially\n\nunreviewed decisions of state agencies were limited to situations\n\nwhere the subsequent case was in federal court.\n\n           In order to find that issue preclusion applies, the\n\ndistrict court held that \"there is nothing explicit or implicit in\n\nthe [TCA] that indicates that Congress intended to depart from the\n\ntraditional   rules   of   preclusion.\"          Id.   We    disagree.     Our\n\nexamination   of   the   TCA   leads   us   to    conclude    that   to   apply\n\nprinciples of issue preclusion, at least in the situation presented\n\nhere, would contravene the intent of Congress.\n\n           In a sense, issue preclusion rules are about allocation\n\nof authority to decide a question.           General application of the\n\nfederal common law of issue preclusion would threaten two different\n\nallocations of power under the TCA: the allocation among the\n\ncommissions of each state as to the effectuation of their state's\n\npolicies and the allocation of power between the FCC and the\n\nstates.\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\f           The model under the TCA is to divide authority among the\n\nFCC and the state commissions in an unusual regime of \"cooperative\n\nfederalism,\" see P.R.

See P. Huber et al., Federal\n\nTelecommunications Law §§ 3.3.3-3.3.4 (2d ed. 1999).                  Rather than\n\nplacing the entire scope of regulatory authority in the federal\n\ngovernment, \"Congress enlisted the aid of state public utility\n\ncommissions to ensure that local competition was implemented fairly\n\nand with due regard to the local conditions and the particular\n\nhistorical    circumstances       of    local    regulation   under    the   prior\n\nregime.\"     Id. § 3.3.4, at 227.              We see little indication that\n\nCongress intended its explicit allocation of authority between\n\nstate commissions to be generally displaced by common law rules\n\nthat themselves allocate authority.\n\n           The goal of preserving a role for the state regulatory\n\ncommissions is reflected in a number of provisions in the TCA.\n\nCongress expressly left with the states the power to enforce \"any\n\nregulation, order, or policy of a State commission that . . .\n\nestablishes    access   and       interconnection      obligations      of   local\n\nexchange carriers; . . . is consistent with the requirements of\n\nthis   section;   and   .     .     .    does    not   substantially     prevent\n\nimplementation of the requirements of this section and the purposes\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\fof this part.\"        47 U.S.C. § 251(d)(3).                   While the TCA prevents\n\nstates and localities from passing laws \"hav[ing] the effect of\n\nprohibiting the ability of any entity to provide interstate or\n\nintrastate telecommunications service,\" id. § 253(a), it allows \"a\n\nState    to   impose,      on   a    competitively           neutral    basis    .   .    .    ,\n\nrequirements necessary to preserve and advance universal service,\n\nprotect the public safety and welfare, ensure the continued quality\n\nof   telecommunications         services,            and    safeguard    the    rights        of\n\nconsumers,\" id. § 253(b).\n\n              The   role    played       by    state       commissions    is    especially\n\nimportant     with    respect       to     interconnection        agreements.            State\n\ncommissions are given the authority to resolve though arbitration\n\nor     mediation     any    open      issues         in    ongoing     negotiations       for\n\ninterconnection        agreements.            Id.     §     252(a)(2).          Before        an\n\ninterconnection agreement goes into effect, it must be approved by\n\na state commission, which may reject the agreement if it \"is not\n\nconsistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity\" or\n\nit \"discriminates against a telecommunications carrier not a party\n\nto the agreement.\"         Id. § 252(e)(2).               Congress expressly preserved\n\neach     state's     authority        to      \"establish[]       or     enforc[e]        other\n\nrequirements of State law in [a State commission's] review of an\n\nagreement,      including           requiring         compliance       with     intrastate\n\ntelecommunications service quality standards or requirements\" as\n\n\n\n\n                                              -29-\n\flong as those requirements do not serve as barriers to entry.

For example, if a state commission fails to\n\ncarry    out    the    duties     required       of   it   with   respect       to    its\n\nconsideration of a particular interconnection agreement, the FCC is\n\ngiven authority to preempt the state commission's jurisdiction and\n\nassume direct responsibility for that agreement.                  Id. § 252(e)(5).\n\nDirect    review      of    the   state   commission's       failure       to   act    is\n\nforeclosed; the FCC's actions in response to an alleged failure to\n\nact, and judicial review of those actions, are the \"exclusive\n\nremedies.\" Id. § 252(e)(6).           In addition, the FCC may preempt the\n\nenforcement of a state or local law if it finds, after notice and\n\nan opportunity for comment, that the law acts as a barrier to\n\nentry.    Id. § 253(e).           In addition to these specific grants of\n\nauthority, the FCC has broad regulatory authority over the TCA.\n\nSee id. § 201(b) (\"The Commission may prescribe such rules and\n\nregulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out\n\n\n                                          -30-\n\fthe provisions of this chapter.\"); AT&T Corp. v.

The FCC, in\n\nexercising the power granted to it under the TCA, has indicated\n\nthat the DTE is the decision-making authority as to the issue here.\n\nIn    Paragraph         32,   the    FCC    noted   that    the        adoption      of    an\n\ninterconnection agreement from another state was subject to the\n\nproviso that the agreement had to be \"consistent with the laws and\n\nregulatory requirements of . . . the state for which the request is\n\nmade.\"         Merger Order, 15 F.C.C.R. 14032 app. D at 14310.                            In\n\nconsidering the agreement here, the FCC reiterated that under the\n\nterms of Paragraph 32 \"only the relevant state commission may\n\nultimately decide whether particular terms of the agreement should\n\nbe adopted in that state, and if so, what those terms mean.\"\n\nParagraph 32 Order, 17 F.C.C.R. at 4039.\n\n                As a result of these orders, the FCC has essentially done\n\nthree things.           It has said that nothing in the TCA itself requires\n\nas    a    matter   of     federal    law    that   Verizon      pay    the    reciprocal\n\ncompensation charges.           It has also said that each state commission\n\nmay make its own determination on the issue under state law.                              And\n\n\n                                            -31-\n\falthough the FCC required Verizon to enter an agreement with Global\n\nusing the same language as the Rhode Island agreement, it also\n\nrecognized that there was a dispute about that language and that\n\nthe relevant state commission (the DTE) should decide the issue.\n\n          For a court to step in and shift the state-by-state\n\ndecision-making authority from the Massachusetts DTE to the RIPUC\n\non this issue would upset the allocations of authority made out\n\nunder the TCA.      A judicially imposed rule of preclusion here would\n\nalso set up an opportunity for regulatory arbitrage contrary to the\n\npurposes of the TCA.     It is common in the telecommunications world\n\nfor   ILECs   and    CLECs   to    negotiate    multiple   interconnection\n\nagreements    across    multiple    states     simultaneously,   and   these\n\nagreements often contain identical terms.          Given this fact, a rule\n\ngranting preclusive effect to the decision of the first state\n\ncommission on a particular issue creates the risk of perverse\n\nincentives.   Carriers looking to lock in a friendly interpretation\n\nwill race to the state commission with the most amenable views, and\n\nperhaps leverage that decision to their advantage in other states.\n\nThe state commissions themselves would be encouraged to decide an\n\nissue as quickly as possible, to preserve their independence and to\n\navoid being bound by another state agency's interpretations of\n\ncontractual terms.      These results cut directly against Congress's\n\ndesire, as evinced by the text and structure of the TCA, \"to ensure\n\nthat local competition [be] implemented fairly and with due regard\n\n\n                                    -32-\n\fto the local conditions and the particular historical circumstances\n\nof local regulation under the prior regime.\"          P. Huber et al.,\n\nsupra, § 3.3.4, at 227.\n\n           To be sure, in some other circumstances, deference by one\n\nstate commission to another state's conclusions may be appropriate.\n\nFor example, the FCC has chosen to give presumptive effect to\n\ncertain findings regarding technical feasibility by one state\n\ncommission.     See 47 C.F.R. § 51.319(b)(3)(ii) (\"Once one state\n\ncommission has determined that it is technically feasible to\n\nunbundle subloops at a designated point, an incumbent LEC in any\n\nstate   shall   have   the   burden   of   demonstrating   to   the   state\n\ncommission . . . that it is not technically feasible . . . to\n\nunbundle its own loops at such a point.\"); id. § 51.230(c) (\"Upon\n\na successful demonstration by [a competing] carrier before a\n\nparticular state commission [that 'deployment of a technology falls\n\nwithin the presumption under paragraph (a)(3) of this section'],\n\nthe deployed technology shall be presumed acceptable for deployment\n\nin other areas.\").     This presumption operates not because of the\n\nlaw of issue preclusion but because the FCC has chosen this as an\n\nappropriate method of achieving uniformity.            The FCC has not\n\ncreated any similar presumptions as to the issues presented here.\n\n           In part because of the complications of the TCA's scheme\n\nof cooperative federalism, we do not think it wise to decide this\n\ncase in the broad terms urged by the parties.         We do not address\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\fwhether the enactment of the TCA itself displaced all aspects of\n\nthe federal common law of issue preclusion in the area.                Nor do we\n\naddress   the    extent    to     which    the   TCA   assigns   the   task   of\n\ndisplacement or adoption of rules of issue preclusion to the FCC.\n\nWe also do not resolve the dispute as to whether interconnection\n\nagreements are creatures of state law or federal law.              Rather, we\n\nsimply    find   that     under     the     circumstances   presented     here,\n\napplication of common law principles of issue preclusion would\n\ncontravene the intent of Congress. The district court was in error\n\nwhen it held otherwise.\n\n                                          IV.\n\n           We reverse the district court's judgment and vacate the\n\norder remanding the matter to the DTE; we remand to the district\n\ncourt for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.               Costs\n\nare awarded to Verizon and the DTE.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -34-\n\f</pre>",
