App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Eric\nH. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney General\nMichael B. Mukasey as respondent.\n\f                SELYA, Circuit Judge.             The petitioner, Carlos Eduardo\n\nRivas-Mira, is a native of El Salvador.                  He seeks judicial review\n\nof   a       final   order   of   the    Board    of   Immigration   Appeals   (BIA)\n\naffirming the decision of an immigration judge (IJ) that ordered\n\nhis removal and denied him asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nrelief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT).\n\nAfter careful consideration of the briefs and record, we deny the\n\npetition.\n\n                Our sole focus is the denial of the asylum claim.1               The\n\nbasic facts are straightforward.\n\n                The petitioner arrived illegally in the United States on\n\nJanuary 22, 2005.            Two days later, federal authorities placed him\n\nin removal proceedings.                 See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i).         He\n\nconceded removability and cross-applied for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and CAT protection.\n\n                Following a hearing, the IJ denied the petitioner's\n\nclaims for relief.           She premised her decision on a finding that the\n\npetitioner's testimony lacked credibility.                  At the same time she\n\nfound, in the alternative, that the petitioner's testimony, even if\n\ncredible, failed to demonstrate that he had been or would be\n\npersecuted on the basis of a statutorily protected ground.\n\n\n         1\n       The petitioner conceded removability and has failed to\nadvance any developed argumentation as to any of his other claims\nfor relief. Consequently, we treat those claims as abandoned. See\nMakhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 82 (1st Cir. 2004); United States\nv. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                            -2-\n\f            The    linchpin     of    the    IJ's     decision        —    the     adverse\n\ncredibility       determination       —      is     woven     out         of     perceived\n\ninconsistencies in the petitioner's testimony.                            Thus, we turn\n\ndirectly to that testimony.\n\n            The petitioner related that his troubles in El Salvador\n\nstarted while he worked as a machine operator for Bocadeli Food\n\nProducts.         He    described    an     ongoing    struggle           between      union\n\norganizers and company executives at his workplace.                             The former\n\nwere looking to increase union influence and membership; the latter\n\nwere seeking to thwart the organizers' efforts, partially by\n\nidentifying and firing union sympathizers.\n\n            Among other things, the pro-union contingent employed a\n\ncarrot-and-stick approach.           On the one hand, the union offered to\n\nprotect prospective members from violent gangs that roamed the\n\narea.    On the other hand, the union assisted the gangs in targeting\n\npersons who either sided with management or resisted the union's\n\nblandishments.         The petitioner had no desire to lose his job, but\n\nhe worried about incurring the union's wrath.                      He tried to remain\n\n\"neutral,\" but his efforts at neutrality came to naught.\n\n            The    denouement       took    place     on    July    19,        2004.     The\n\npetitioner testified that, on that date, two armed men boarded a\n\nbus transporting Bocadeli employees home after completing their\n\nshift.    He recognized the men as members of a gang linked to union\n\norganizers.\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f             The intruders relieved the passengers of their valuables\n\n(including bonuses received earlier that day).               They then shot the\n\npetitioner at close range, wounding him in the hand and chest.                 No\n\nshots were fired at any other passenger. The petitioner speculated\n\nthat   his   refusal     to   join   the   union   was   the   reason   why   his\n\nassailants singled him out and shot him.\n\n             The petitioner further testified that, two weeks later,\n\nhe met one of his assailants by happenstance.             He thereafter began\n\nto receive anonymous telephone calls.                The mysterious callers\n\nthreatened to take his life if he chose to report his shooting to\n\nthe police.\n\n             The petitioner indicated that the \"bus incident\" was not\n\nan isolated instance of violence.            His brother was robbed under\n\nsimilar circumstances in November of 2004 and the robbers passed\n\nalong a warning that the petitioner should not \"open [his] mouth.\"\n\nAdditionally, the petitioner vouchsafed that he knew of four\n\ncoworkers who had been assaulted for providing information to\n\nmanagement about union activity.             Finally, he claimed that his\n\ncousin was killed by gang members in 2006 (after the petitioner had\n\nfled to the United States).\n\n             Comparing    the    petitioner's      written     application    for\n\nasylum, his affidavit supplementing that application, and his\n\nhearing testimony, the IJ detected a bevy of discrepancies.                   The\n\nmost important related to the petitioner's failure to mention, in\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fhis asylum application, any connection between the bus incident and\n\nhis supposed unwillingness to support the union.        Indeed, his\n\noriginal filings did not refer at all to any union activity or\n\nunion-related violence.   Those omissions were all the more glaring\n\nwhen combined with evidence of the petitioner's statement to a\n\nborder patrol agent, credited by the IJ, that the petitioner had\n\n\"no fear of returning to El Salvador.\"\n\n          There were other inconsistencies as well.    For example,\n\nthe petitioner testified that he started working part-time for\n\nBocadeli in 1997 and became a full-time employee two years later.\n\nThis contrasted not only with his asylum application (which noted\n\na starting date in 1996) but also with a letter from Bocadeli\n\n(which indicated that his employment had commenced in 2000).\n\nSimilar inconsistencies plagued the petitioner's descriptions of\n\nthe time he spent recuperating from the shooting.       Although he\n\ntestified that his injuries required him to miss two months of\n\nwork, he submitted a letter from his social worker stating that he\n\nhad missed only one month.\n\n          The petitioner appealed the denial of relief to the BIA,\n\nwhich affirmed the IJ's ukase.    This timely petition for judicial\n\nreview followed.\n\n          Ordinarily, the court of appeals reviews only the final\n\norder of the BIA.   But where, as here, the BIA has adopted the IJ's\n\ndecision in whole or in part, we review the pertinent portions of\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthe IJ's decision as well.          See Bebri v. Mukasey, 545 F.3d 47, 49-\n\n50 (1st Cir. 2008); Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir.\n\n2003). Factual findings, including credibility determinations, are\n\nassessed under the familiar substantial evidence standard.                      See\n\nSegran v. Mukasey, 511 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2007).                  That standard\n\nrequires us to uphold the agency's findings so long as the record\n\ndoes not \"compel a reasonable factfinder to reach a contrary\n\ndetermination.\"          Chhay v. Mukasey, 540 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\nPut   another      way,    such   findings     will   stand   whenever   they   are\n\n\"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.\"              Segran, 511 F.3d at 5 (quoting\n\nINS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992)).                       Answers to\n\nabstract legal questions are reviewed de novo, with deference,\n\nhowever, to the agency's reasonable interpretation of statutes and\n\nregulations within its ken.            Pan v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d 80, 85 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).\n\n             To qualify for asylum, an alien must establish that he is\n\na refugee within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42). Satisfying\n\nthis burden requires a showing of either past persecution or a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution if repatriated, on account\n\nof    one   of    five    enumerated    grounds,      namely,   race,    religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.         See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see also Makhoul v.\n\nAshcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 80-81 (1st Cir 2004).                     An alien's own\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\ftestimony may be adequate to carry this burden.               Bebri, 545 F.3d at\n\n50.    Nevertheless, the alien's testimony need not be taken at face\n\nvalue; that testimony may be discounted or disregarded if the IJ\n\nreasonably deems it to be \"speculative or unworthy of credence.\"\n\nId.    Hence, \"an adverse credibility determination can prove fatal\"\n\nto an asylum claim.         Id. (quoting Pan, 489 F.3d at 86).          We must\n\ninquire, then, as to whether this is such a case.\n\n              In denying asylum, the IJ concluded that the petitioner's\n\nstory       was     incredible.          The     petitioner     disputes   that\n\ncharacterization,         alleging       that     the   adverse     credibility\n\ndetermination placed excessive weight on trivial inconsistences.\n\nUpon close perscrutation, we find that allegation unfounded.\n\n              Before beginning our explanation, we first must answer a\n\nthreshold question.        The petitioner applied for asylum on January\n\n11, 2006.         Because his application postdates the enactment of the\n\nREAL ID Act, Pub. L. 109-13, 119 Stat. 302 (2005), the credibility\n\ndefinition at issue here is subject to a provision of that Act,\n\ncodified at 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii), rather than to the\n\npreexisting \"heart of the matter\" rule.              The earlier rule required\n\nthat an adverse credibility finding be based on inconsistencies that\n\n\"pertain to facts central to the merits of the alien's claims.\"\n\nBebri, 545 F.3d at 50 (quoting Zheng v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 60, 63\n\n(1st Cir. 2006)).        The new statute disavows that test; it provides\n\nthat    a    factfinder    may    base    a     credibility   determination   on\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\finconsistencies, inaccuracies, or falsehoods \"without regard to\n\nwhether [any such inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood] goes to\n\nthe    heart   of    the    applicant's         claim.\"       8   U.S.C.    §   1158\n\n(b)(1)(B)(iii).       We therefore proceed to evaluate the IJ's adverse\n\ncredibility determination under that standard and in light of the\n\ntotality of the circumstances.            See, e.g., Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey,\n\n534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir. 2008); Kadia v. Gonzales, 501 F.3d 817,\n\n822 (7th Cir.       2007); Chen v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 463 F.3d 1228, 1233\n\n(11th Cir. 2006).\n\n            The petitioner attempts to circumvent this obstacle by\n\narguing that the new test includes a rationality requirement, thus\n\nrendering it functionally equivalent to the old \"heart of the\n\nmatter\" rule.       This reasoning relies heavily on a footnote in Lin\n\nv. Mukasey, 521 F.3d 22, 28 n.3 (1st Cir. 2008).                     The petitioner\n\nreads the Lin footnote as indicating that the new statute should be\n\ninterpreted narrowly.        We reject that crabbed reading.\n\n            In Lin, we examined the background of this new provision\n\nof the REAL ID Act, noting that its principal purpose was to\n\neliminate a limitation, elaborated by the Ninth Circuit, on the type\n\nof    inconsistencies      upon   which    an    IJ   could   rely    in   assessing\n\ncredibility.    See id. (citing Abovian v. INS, 257 F.3d 971, 977-79\n\n(9th Cir. 2001) (Kozinski, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing\n\nen banc)).     The net effect of the neoteric provision was to scrap\n\nthe \"heart of the matter\" rule.             See id.; see also H.R. Rep. No.\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f418, 109th Cong. (2005), reprinted at 151 Cong. Rec. H536-41 (daily\n\ned. Feb. 10, 2005).     However, we warned that even under the new\n\nstandard,    credibility      determinations    nonetheless    must    \"be\n\n'reasonable'    and   'take     into     consideration   the   individual\n\ncircumstances' of the applicant.\"        Lin, 521 F.3d at 28 n.3 (quoting\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 109-72, at 167, reprinted in 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 240,\n\n292).\n\n            The Lin court recognized that this language, if taken\n\nliterally, might create a \"rationality requirement,\" but left open\n\nthe question of whether (or to what extent) an adverse credibility\n\ndetermination can be based on inconsistencies not directly related\n\nto the central issues in an alien's case.        Id.\n\n            Although the petitioner labors to pursue this subject, we\n\nhave no occasion to explore it here. The \"heart of the matter\" rule\n\nis dead, and the main inconsistencies on which the IJ relied — the\n\nabsence of any reference to union activity in the petitioner's\n\ninitial submissions and his failure there to link the bus incident\n\nto union strife — cannot be dismissed as a minor blemish.             These\n\ninconsistencies go to the essence of the petitioner's claim: after\n\nall, the assailants' motivation for singling out the petitioner was\n\ncrucial to his assertion that he had been persecuted for, and feared\n\nfuture retribution on account of, his failure to adopt a pro-union\n\nstance.   If the new statute imposes a rationality requirement, that\n\nrequirement would be satisfied here.\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f          The   petitioner   has   a   fallback    position.     He   lamely\n\nsuggests that the trauma of the attack prevented him from discussing\n\nthe matter fully during the initial stages of the asylum process.\n\nThat suggestion lacks any credible support in the record.                 The\n\npetitioner had no difficulty in describing the attack in great\n\ndetail, and it is implausible that he would have recalled the attack\n\nitself but blocked out its union-related aspects.\n\n          We need not tarry.       While the inconsistencies anent the\n\npetitioner's employment history and recuperation period may be\n\nfribbling, the main inconsistencies noted by the IJ are of a type\n\nand kind that create strong doubts about the veracity of the\n\npetitioner's tale.   Of course, the petitioner attempted to explain\n\naway these anomalies, blaming others for them.                 However, his\n\nexplanations are not convincing.       That is especially so in light of\n\nhis stated lack of any fear of returning to El Salvador.              In all\n\nevents, the IJ was not required to accept those explanations.\n\n          To sum up, the inconsistencies, collectively, viewed in\n\nlight of the totality of the circumstances, constitute substantial\n\nevidence sufficient to support the IJ's adverse credibility finding.\n\nSee, e.g., Bebri, 545 F.3d at 51; see also Pan, 489 F.3d at 86\n\n(explaining   that   while   \"[s]ome      of   these   inconsistencies,    in\n\nisolation, may seem like small potatoes . . . their cumulative\n\neffect is great\").    In short, we see nothing in the record before\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fus that would compel a conclusion that the petitioner's testimony\n\nwas credible.\n\n          To say more would be to paint the lily.                Once we accept\n\nthe   adverse   credibility   determination      —    as   we     must   —   the\n\npetitioner's    case   collapses.      Without       his   own     (incredible)\n\ntestimony, the record does not show that the petitioner ever\n\ndisplayed an anti-union animus, let alone that he was targeted on\n\nthat account.\n\n          We need go no further.2 For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe deem the denial of asylum to be supported by substantial evidence\n\non the record. Consequently, the petition for review must be denied\n\nand the final order of removal sustained.\n\n\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       Given our rationale, we have no need to explore the IJ's\nalternative holding.\n\n                                    -11-\n\f",

Two days later, federal authorities placed him\n\nin removal proceedings.                 See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i).         He\n\nconceded removability and cross-applied for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and CAT protection.\n\n                Following a hearing, the IJ denied the petitioner's\n\nclaims for relief.           She premised her decision on a finding that the\n\npetitioner's testimony lacked credibility.                  At the same time she\n\nfound, in the alternative, that the petitioner's testimony, even if\n\ncredible, failed to demonstrate that he had been or would be\n\npersecuted on the basis of a statutorily protected ground.\n\n\n         1\n       The petitioner conceded removability and has failed to\nadvance any developed argumentation as to any of his other claims\nfor relief. Consequently, we treat those claims as abandoned. See\nMakhoul v.

Thus, we turn\n\ndirectly to that testimony.\n\n            The petitioner related that his troubles in El Salvador\n\nstarted while he worked as a machine operator for Bocadeli Food\n\nProducts.         He    described    an     ongoing    struggle           between      union\n\norganizers and company executives at his workplace.                             The former\n\nwere looking to increase union influence and membership; the latter\n\nwere seeking to thwart the organizers' efforts, partially by\n\nidentifying and firing union sympathizers.\n\n            Among other things, the pro-union contingent employed a\n\ncarrot-and-stick approach.           On the one hand, the union offered to\n\nprotect prospective members from violent gangs that roamed the\n\narea.    On the other hand, the union assisted the gangs in targeting\n\npersons who either sided with management or resisted the union's\n\nblandishments.         The petitioner had no desire to lose his job, but\n\nhe worried about incurring the union's wrath.                      He tried to remain\n\n\"neutral,\" but his efforts at neutrality came to naught.\n\n            The    denouement       took    place     on    July    19,        2004.     The\n\npetitioner testified that, on that date, two armed men boarded a\n\nbus transporting Bocadeli employees home after completing their\n\nshift.    He recognized the men as members of a gang linked to union\n\norganizers.\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f             The intruders relieved the passengers of their valuables\n\n(including bonuses received earlier that day).               They then shot the\n\npetitioner at close range, wounding him in the hand and chest.                 No\n\nshots were fired at any other passenger. The petitioner speculated\n\nthat   his   refusal     to   join   the   union   was   the   reason   why   his\n\nassailants singled him out and shot him.\n\n             The petitioner further testified that, two weeks later,\n\nhe met one of his assailants by happenstance.             He thereafter began\n\nto receive anonymous telephone calls.                The mysterious callers\n\nthreatened to take his life if he chose to report his shooting to\n\nthe police.\n\n             The petitioner indicated that the \"bus incident\" was not\n\nan isolated instance of violence.            His brother was robbed under\n\nsimilar circumstances in November of 2004 and the robbers passed\n\nalong a warning that the petitioner should not \"open [his] mouth.\"\n\nAdditionally, the petitioner vouchsafed that he knew of four\n\ncoworkers who had been assaulted for providing information to\n\nmanagement about union activity.             Finally, he claimed that his\n\ncousin was killed by gang members in 2006 (after the petitioner had\n\nfled to the United States).\n\n             Comparing    the    petitioner's      written     application    for\n\nasylum, his affidavit supplementing that application, and his\n\nhearing testimony, the IJ detected a bevy of discrepancies.                   The\n\nmost important related to the petitioner's failure to mention, in\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fhis asylum application, any connection between the bus incident and\n\nhis supposed unwillingness to support the union.        Indeed, his\n\noriginal filings did not refer at all to any union activity or\n\nunion-related violence.   Those omissions were all the more glaring\n\nwhen combined with evidence of the petitioner's statement to a\n\nborder patrol agent, credited by the IJ, that the petitioner had\n\n\"no fear of returning to El Salvador.\"\n\n          There were other inconsistencies as well.    For example,\n\nthe petitioner testified that he started working part-time for\n\nBocadeli in 1997 and became a full-time employee two years later.\n\nThis contrasted not only with his asylum application (which noted\n\na starting date in 1996) but also with a letter from Bocadeli\n\n(which indicated that his employment had commenced in 2000).\n\nSimilar inconsistencies plagued the petitioner's descriptions of\n\nthe time he spent recuperating from the shooting.       Although he\n\ntestified that his injuries required him to miss two months of\n\nwork, he submitted a letter from his social worker stating that he\n\nhad missed only one month.\n\n          The petitioner appealed the denial of relief to the BIA,\n\nwhich affirmed the IJ's ukase.    This timely petition for judicial\n\nreview followed.\n\n          Ordinarily, the court of appeals reviews only the final\n\norder of the BIA.   But where, as here, the BIA has adopted the IJ's\n\ndecision in whole or in part, we review the pertinent portions of\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthe IJ's decision as well.

See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see also Makhoul v.\n\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201313\"><a href=\"/opinion/201313/makhoul-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80-81 (1st Cir 2004).                     An alien's own\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\ftestimony may be adequate to carry this burden.               Bebri, 545 F.3d at\n\n50.    Nevertheless, the alien's testimony need not be taken at face\n\nvalue; that testimony may be discounted or disregarded if the IJ\n\nreasonably deems it to be \"speculative or unworthy of credence.\"\n\nId.    Hence, \"an adverse credibility determination can prove fatal\"\n\nto an asylum claim.         Id. (quoting Pan, 489 F.3d at 86).          We must\n\ninquire, then, as to whether this is such a case.\n\n              In denying asylum, the IJ concluded that the petitioner's\n\nstory       was     incredible.          The     petitioner     disputes   that\n\ncharacterization,         alleging       that     the   adverse     credibility\n\ndetermination placed excessive weight on trivial inconsistences.\n\nUpon close perscrutation, we find that allegation unfounded.\n\n              Before beginning our explanation, we first must answer a\n\nthreshold question.        The petitioner applied for asylum on January\n\n11, 2006.         Because his application postdates the enactment of the\n\nREAL ID Act, Pub. L. 109-13, 119 Stat. 302 (2005), the credibility\n\ndefinition at issue here is subject to a provision of that Act,\n\ncodified at 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii), rather than to the\n\npreexisting \"heart of the matter\" rule.              The earlier rule required\n\nthat an adverse credibility finding be based on inconsistencies that\n\n\"pertain to facts central to the merits of the alien's claims.\"\n\nBebri, 545 F.3d at 50 (quoting Zheng v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202459\"><a href=\"/opinion/202459/zheng-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 63\n\n(1st Cir. 2006)).        The new statute disavows that test; it provides\n\nthat    a    factfinder    may    base    a     credibility   determination   on\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\finconsistencies, inaccuracies, or falsehoods \"without regard to\n\nwhether [any such inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood] goes to\n\nthe    heart   of    the    applicant's         claim.\"       8   U.S.C.    §   1158\n\n(b)(1)(B)(iii).       We therefore proceed to evaluate the IJ's adverse\n\ncredibility determination under that standard and in light of the\n\ntotality of the circumstances.            See, e.g., Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1198745\"><a href=\"/opinion/1198745/xiu-xia-lin-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 167 (2d Cir. 2008); Kadia v.

This reasoning relies heavily on a footnote in Lin\n\nv. Mukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203205\"><a href=\"/opinion/203205/lin-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 28 n.3 (1st Cir. 2008).                     The petitioner\n\nreads the Lin footnote as indicating that the new statute should be\n\ninterpreted narrowly.        We reject that crabbed reading.\n\n            In Lin, we examined the background of this new provision\n\nof the REAL ID Act, noting that its principal purpose was to\n\neliminate a limitation, elaborated by the Ninth Circuit, on the type\n\nof    inconsistencies      upon   which    an    IJ   could   rely    in   assessing\n\ncredibility.    See id. (citing Abovian v.

The net effect of the neoteric provision was to scrap\n\nthe \"heart of the matter\" rule.             See id.; see also H.R. Rep. No.\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f418, 109th Cong. (2005), reprinted at 151 Cong. Rec. H536-41 (daily\n\ned. Feb. 10, 2005).     However, we warned that even under the new\n\nstandard,    credibility      determinations    nonetheless    must    \"be\n\n'reasonable'    and   'take     into     consideration   the   individual\n\ncircumstances' of the applicant.\"        Lin, 521 F.3d at 28 n.3 (quoting\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 109-72, at 167, reprinted in 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 240,\n\n292).\n\n            The Lin court recognized that this language, if taken\n\nliterally, might create a \"rationality requirement,\" but left open\n\nthe question of whether (or to what extent) an adverse credibility\n\ndetermination can be based on inconsistencies not directly related\n\nto the central issues in an alien's case.        Id.\n\n            Although the petitioner labors to pursue this subject, we\n\nhave no occasion to explore it here. The \"heart of the matter\" rule\n\nis dead, and the main inconsistencies on which the IJ relied — the\n\nabsence of any reference to union activity in the petitioner's\n\ninitial submissions and his failure there to link the bus incident\n\nto union strife — cannot be dismissed as a minor blemish.             These\n\ninconsistencies go to the essence of the petitioner's claim: after\n\nall, the assailants' motivation for singling out the petitioner was\n\ncrucial to his assertion that he had been persecuted for, and feared\n\nfuture retribution on account of, his failure to adopt a pro-union\n\nstance.   If the new statute imposes a rationality requirement, that\n\nrequirement would be satisfied here.\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f          The   petitioner   has   a   fallback    position.     He   lamely\n\nsuggests that the trauma of the attack prevented him from discussing\n\nthe matter fully during the initial stages of the asylum process.\n\nThat suggestion lacks any credible support in the record.                 The\n\npetitioner had no difficulty in describing the attack in great\n\ndetail, and it is implausible that he would have recalled the attack\n\nitself but blocked out its union-related aspects.\n\n          We need not tarry.       While the inconsistencies anent the\n\npetitioner's employment history and recuperation period may be\n\nfribbling, the main inconsistencies noted by the IJ are of a type\n\nand kind that create strong doubts about the veracity of the\n\npetitioner's tale.   Of course, the petitioner attempted to explain\n\naway these anomalies, blaming others for them.                 However, his\n\nexplanations are not convincing.       That is especially so in light of\n\nhis stated lack of any fear of returning to El Salvador.              In all\n\nevents, the IJ was not required to accept those explanations.\n\n          To sum up, the inconsistencies, collectively, viewed in\n\nlight of the totality of the circumstances, constitute substantial\n\nevidence sufficient to support the IJ's adverse credibility finding.\n\nSee, e.g., Bebri, 545 F.3d at 51; see also Pan, 489 F.3d at 86\n\n(explaining   that   while   \"[s]ome      of   these   inconsistencies,    in\n\nisolation, may seem like small potatoes . . . their cumulative\n\neffect is great\").    In short, we see nothing in the record before\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fus that would compel a conclusion that the petitioner's testimony\n\nwas credible.\n\n          To say more would be to paint the lily.                Once we accept\n\nthe   adverse   credibility   determination      —    as   we     must   —   the\n\npetitioner's    case   collapses.      Without       his   own     (incredible)\n\ntestimony, the record does not show that the petitioner ever\n\ndisplayed an anti-union animus, let alone that he was targeted on\n\nthat account.\n\n          We need go no further.2 For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe deem the denial of asylum to be supported by substantial evidence\n\non the record. Consequently, the petition for review must be denied\n\nand the final order of removal sustained.\n\n\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       Given our rationale, we have no need to explore the IJ's\nalternative holding.\n\n                                    -11-\n\f</pre>",
