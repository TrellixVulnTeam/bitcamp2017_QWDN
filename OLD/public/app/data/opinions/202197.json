Medicare, a health insurance\n\nprogram, is administered by the Secretary of Health and Human\n\nServices through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nThe Secretary is entrusted by the Medicare Act with the authority\n\nto issue regulations that are necessary for the administration of\n\nthe   health   insurance   program.         Under   the   Act,   providers   are\n\nreimbursed the lesser of their charges or their reasonable costs\n\nincurred in providing covered services to Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1395f(b). The Act requires the Secretary to promulgate\n\nregulations to interpret \"reasonable costs\".\n\n            This case involves a challenge to the applicability of\n\ninterpretive regulations adopted by the Secretary that provide for\n\nthe reimbursement of \"necessary and proper\" costs related to\n\npatient care under the Medicare program.             The case also raises a\n\nrelated issue involving the timing of the Secretary's decision\n\ndenying reimbursement of the costs at issue in this case.                    We\n\naffirm the district court's ruling affirming the decision of the\n\nSecretary.\n\n\n\n                                      I.\n\nA.    Factual and Procedural Background\n\n            Plaintiff-Appellant Visiting Nurse Association Gregoria\n\nAuffant, Inc. (\"Plaintiff\" or \"VNA\") is a non-profit corporation\n\norganized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fRico.1       For the time period at issue here, VNA was a Home Care\n\nMedicare provider within the meaning of the Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1395, et seq.       Plaintiff owns three subsidiary providers in the\n\nMedicare program: VNA Hato Rey, VNA Bayamón, and VNA Carolina.\n\nDefendant-Appellee Tommy G. Thompson was the Secretary of the\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services.2 Defendant-Appellee Ruben\n\nJ. King-Shaw, Jr. is the Deputy Administrator and Chief Operating\n\nOfficer of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\").\n\nKing-Shaw (the \"Administrator\") signed the CMS decision at issue\n\nhere.       Defendant-Appellee United Government Services (\"UGS\"), the\n\nintermediary between Medicare and Plaintiff, conducted the initial\n\nreview of Plaintiff's cost reports discussed below.\n\n               In July 1994, VNA instituted a Deferred Compensation Plan\n\n(\"Plan\" or \"DCP\") for its employees pursuant to which VNA paid a\n\ndeferred \"salary differential\" for each employee participating in\n\nthe Plan.       Plaintiff claimed these contributions to the Plan as\n\ncosts on its Medicare cost reports for fiscal years 1994-1997. UGS\n\nreviewed       Plaintiff's   cost   reports   for   those   fiscal   years,\n\ndetermined that the Plan did not comply with Medicare rules and\n\n\n\n\n        1\n       This area of law is rife with the use of acronyms. To help\nthe reader understand them, we attach an appendix containing a\nglossary of the less common acronyms used in this opinion.\n        2\n       Tommy G. Thompson is no longer the Secretary of Health and\nHuman Services. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 25(d), Michael O.\nLeavitt is automatically substituted in his place.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fregulations, and disallowed reimbursement of costs in the amount of\n\n$353,521.3\n\n             Plaintiff   appealed   UGS's    decision   to   the   Provider\n\nReimbursement Review Board (\"PRRB\" or the \"Board\"), which held a\n\nhearing on November 19, 2001.             On August 9, 2002, the Board\n\nreversed UGS's decision. The Board concluded that VNA was entitled\n\nto reimbursement for its contributions to the Plan, finding that:\n\n(1) UGS never informed VNA that the Plan was invalid; (2) VNA used\n\noutside advisors and consultants to establish the Plan; (3) the\n\nPlan's terms were contained in the personnel by-laws; and (4) VNA\n\ncreated the Plan intending it to be a permanent arrangement.             In\n\nsummary, the Board reversed UGS's decision on the grounds that the\n\nPlan was in \"substantial compliance\" with the provisions of the\n\nMedicare Provider Reimbursement Manual (\"PRM\" or the \"Manual\"); and\n\nany non-compliance of the Plan from the requirements set forth in\n\nthe Manual was de minimus.\n\n             On August 16, 2002, pursuant to 42 C.F.R. § 405.1875,\n\nwhich provides specifically for appeals from decisions of the\n\nBoard, UGS requested a review of the Board's decision, alleging\n\nthat the decision was contrary to the rules and standards contained\n\nin the Manual.    On August 26, 2002, the Administrator notified the\n\n\n\n     3\n       UGS initially reviewed VNA's cost reports for fiscal years\n1996 and 1997 only. After finding non-compliance in these reports,\nUGS reopened the cost reports for 1994 and 1995, adjusting those\ncosts related to the Plan.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fparties of its intention to review the Board's decision.              VNA was\n\nalso notified that the Administrator would issue his decision,\n\nwhich constitutes the Secretary's final decision, within sixty (60)\n\ndays of VNA's receipt of the Board's decision.\n\n           On   October    8,    2002,    the   Administrator   reversed   the\n\ndecision of the Board, finding that the Plan did not qualify as a\n\nformal DCP. Specifically, the Administrator found that VNA had not\n\ndeposited its contributions with an appropriate funding agent; the\n\nPlan was contingent rather than permanent in nature; and the Plan\n\ndid not meet the requirements for Medicare reimbursement as a\n\nformal DCP for the 1994-97 period.               On October 10, 2002, the\n\nAdministrator's decision was sent to VNA by certified mail.\n\n           On   December    3,    2002,    VNA   requested   review   of   the\n\nAdministrator's decision in federal district court pursuant to the\n\nAdministrative Procedures Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-06.                 VNA\n\neventually moved for summary judgment; Defendants opposed the\n\nmotion and submitted a cross-motion for summary judgment.                   On\n\nSeptember 30, 2004, the district court issued an order denying\n\nVNA's summary judgment motion and granting Defendants' motion,\n\naffirming the decision of the Secretary.            This appeal followed.\n\nB.   Standard of Review\n\n           We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo.   Dominguez-Cruz v. Suttle Caribe, Inc., 202 F.3d 424, 428\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).   However, \"this rubric has a special twist in the\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fadministrative law context.\"            Associated Fisheries of Maine, Inc.\n\nv. Daley, 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 1997).                       \"Because the APA\n\nstandard affords great deference to agency decisionmaking and\n\nbecause the Secretary's action is presumed valid, judicial review,\n\neven at the summary judgment stage, is narrow.\"                    Id.     Pursuant to\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1395oo(f)(1), judicial review of the reimbursement\n\ndecision is governed by the standards detailed in the APA.                      Thus,\n\nwe may only set aside agency actions, findings, and conclusions if\n\nthey     are   \"arbitrary,      capricious,    an    abuse    of     discretion,      or\n\notherwise       not    in   accordance     with     law\"     or    \"unsupported       by\n\nsubstantial evidence\".           5 U.S.C. § 706(2).          Substantial evidence\n\nmeans \"more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence\n\nas   a   reasonable      mind   might    accept     as   adequate     to    support    a\n\nconclusion.\"          Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401 (1971).\n\nAdditionally, in the situation here, the district court acts as an\n\nintermediate appellate court.             Therefore, \"when reviewing agency\n\naction, we apply the same legal standards that pertain in the\n\ndistrict court and afford no special deference to that court's\n\ndecision.\"      Associated Fisheries, 127 F.3d at 109.\n\n               Furthermore, \"[w]here Congress has entrusted rulemaking\n\nand administrative authority to an agency, courts normally accord\n\nthe agency particular deference in respect to the interpretation of\n\nregulations promulgated under that authority.\"                    South Shore Hosp.,\n\nInc. v. Thompson, 308 F.3d 91, 97 (1st Cir. 2002); see also Bowles\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fv. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U.S. 410, 414 (1945).              \"Courts\n\nwithhold such deference only when the agency's interpretation of\n\nits regulation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with its\n\nlanguage.\"    South Shore Hosp., 308 F.3d at 97 (internal citations\n\nand quotation marks omitted).      \"In situations in which the meaning\n\nof regulatory language is not free from doubt, the reviewing court\n\nshould give effect to the agency's interpretation so long as it is\n\nreasonable,   that   is,   so   long    as   the   interpretation   sensibly\n\nconforms to the purpose and wording of the regulations.\" Martin v.\n\nOccupational Safety & Health Review Comm'n, 499 U.S. 144, 150-51\n\n(1991)(internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n           However, pronouncements in manuals like the PRM, which do\n\nnot have the force of law, are entitled to less deference than an\n\ninterpretation arrived at after a formal adjudication or notice-\n\nand-comment rulemaking. See Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S.\n\n576, 587 (2000) (explaining that administrative interpretations\n\nreceive Skidmore deference rather than Chevron deference).                We\n\nproceed with these standards in mind.\n\n\n\n                                       II.\n\nA.   Timing of the Decision of the Administrator for the Centers for\n     Medicare and Medicaid Services\n\n           42 U.S.C. § 1395oo(f)(1) states in relevant part that\n\n\"[a] decision of the [PRRB] shall be final unless the Secretary, on\n\nhis own motion, and within 60 days after the provider of services\n\n                                       -7-\n\fis notified of the Board's decision, reverses, affirms, or modifies\n\nthe [PRRB]'s decision.\" In turn, 42 C.F.R. § 405.1875(g) states in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n     (1) If the Administrator has notified the parties and CMS\n     that he or she has decided to review a [PRRB] decision,\n     the Administrator will affirm, reverse, modify or remand\n     the case.\n     (2) The Administrator will make this decision within 60\n     days after the provider received notification of the\n     [PRRB] decision and will promptly mail a copy of the\n     decision to each party and to CMS.\n\nBoth the statute and the regulations implementing the statute\n\nrequire the    Administrator -- who acts with the authority of the\n\nSecretary -- to conduct and conclude his review of a Board decision\n\nwithin a 60-day period.     VNA asserts that the Administrator failed\n\nto make his decision within that 60-day period.         As a result, VNA\n\nargues that the Board decision is final, and the Administrator's\n\nsilence constitutes approval of the Board's decision.\n\n            There is no factual dispute that: (1) the Board issued\n\nits decision on August 9, 2002; (2) the Administrator signed and\n\ndated his decision on October 8, 2002; and (3) the Administrator's\n\ndecision was mailed to VNA on October 10, 2002. Plaintiff contends\n\nthat 42 C.F.R. § 405.1875(g)(2) requires the Administrator to make\n\nhis decision and mail that decision within the 60-day window.           The\n\nrelevant dates for this proposition would be August 9, 2002, and\n\nOctober 10, 2002; sixty-one (61) days would have elapsed using this\n\nscenario.     With   the   Secretary   not   having   complied   with   the\n\napplicable time requirements, the Board's decision would be final.\n\n                                  -8-\n\f                 However,    Plaintiff's          argument    is   predicated      on    an\n\nunnatural        reading     of    the    regulatory       language.      42    C.F.R.    §\n\n405.1875(g)(2)        reads        that    \"the      Administrator     will    make    this\n\ndecision within 60 days . . . and will promptly mail a copy.\"                            If\n\nthe regulation required the Administrator to make his decision and\n\nmail it within 60 days, the regulation would have placed \"within 60\n\ndays\" at the end of the regulation.                    Then the 60-day period would\n\napply to both the making of the decision and its mailing.                        However,\n\nthe plain language of the regulation states that the Administrator\n\nneed only make his decision within the 60-day period.                         He must then\n\nmail       his    decision    promptly         thereafter,     which     is     what    the\n\nAdministrator did.           The date the Administrator signed his decision\n\nis   the     appropriate          date    to   use    in   calculating    whether       the\n\nAdministrator complied with the 60-day period.                         Using that day,\n\nOctober 8, 2002, the Administrator made his decision in fifty-nine\n\n(59) days, within the 60-day period detailed in both the statute\n\nand the regulations. As a result, the CMS Administrator's decision\n\nwas properly before the district court.4\n\n\n       4\n       Defendants also argue, in the alternative, that the day the\n60-day window began should be August 13, 2002, not August 9, 2002,\nasserting that the 60 days begins to run when a plaintiff receives\nactual notice of the Board's decision.      Defendants based this\nargument on our decision in Hospital San Jorge v. Secretary of\nHealth, Education, and Welfare, 616 F.2d 580 (1st Cir. 1980).\nThere, we held that the 60-day time period under 42 U.S.C. §\n1395oo(f)(1) commences the date the party receives notice of the\ndecision through the mail.    Id. at 585 n.6.    In that case, we\nassumed that a mailing took four days. Id. In light of Hospital\nSan Jorge, the district court found Defendants' alternative timing\n\n                                               -9-\n\fB.   The Applicability of the Provider Reimbursement Manual\n\n           Plaintiff makes two attempts to avoid the applicability\n\nof the Manual to the Plan.    VNA first argues that the Manual is\n\njust a \"codified interpretation\" of the Employee Retirement Income\n\nSecurity Act (\"ERISA\").      Since the Plan complied with ERISA,\n\naccording to Plaintiff, it was entitled to Medicare reimbursement.\n\nThis argument is unsupported by any authority.\n\n           The Manual anticipates different types of retirement\n\nplans that a Medicare provider may offer to its employees.    In §§\n\n2140.1-2140.6, the Manual sets forth the rules governing the broad\n\ncategory of retirement plan involved in this case -- the deferred\n\ncompensation plan. In subsequent sections, specifically §§ 2141.1-\n\n2141.7 and §§ 2142.1-2142.7, the Manual sets forth the rules\n\ngoverning two subcategories of a DCP, the \"defined contribution\n\ndeferred compensation plan\" and the \"pension plan\", respectively.\n\n           In support of its position that the PRM \"codifies\" ERISA,\n\nPlaintiff asserts that \"[n]owhere in the PRM is a conceptual link\n\nbetween said Manual and ERISA more clearly suggested and easily\n\napparent, than in Section 2141.1 of the PRM.\"     In § 2141.1, the\n\nManual states in relevant part that: \"Defined contribution deferred\n\ncompensation plans include profit sharing, stock bonus, and other\n\nsuch defined contribution deferred compensation plans that meet\n\n\nargument also valid. We agree with the district court that this\ndecision   supports  equally   well  the   conclusion  that   the\nAdministrator's decision was issued within the 60-day period.\n\n                                -10-\n\fInternal      Revenue    Service   (\"IRS\")     or    [ERISA]   requirements      as\n\nqualified plans and have been so approved by the IRS.\"\n\n              First, § 2141.1 defines the DCP subcategory of \"defined\n\ncontribution deferred compensation plans\" only; the Plan at issue\n\nhere does not fall into that category.              As noted, the Plan at issue\n\nhere falls into the general category of a deferred compensation\n\nplan, which is governed by §§ 2140.1-2140.6. Those sections do not\n\nrefer to ERISA.         Second, and more importantly, the reference to\n\nERISA    in   §   2141.1   is    only   used   to     distinguish    a   deferred\n\ncompensation      plan    that   qualifies     as    a   \"defined   contribution\n\ndeferred compensation plan\" from one that does not.                 Even for the\n\ndefined    contribution     deferred     compensation      plan,    there   is   no\n\nsuggestion that the PRM is simply a codified interpretation of\n\nERISA.    Indeed, whether for a \"regular\" deferred compensation plan\n\nor for a defined contribution deferred compensation plan, the\n\nquestion of Medicare reimbursement would be determined by the\n\nMedicare Act and its related regulations, not ERISA.                     ERISA is\n\nirrelevant to the issue of Medicare reimbursement for contributions\n\nto a DCP.\n\n              In a second attempt to avoid the applicability of the\n\nManual to the Plan, Plaintiff argues that the Manual was preempted\n\nby ERISA.      ERISA states in relevant part that \"[n]othing in this\n\nsubchapter shall be construed to alter, amend, modify, invalidate,\n\nimpair, or supersede any law of the United States . . . or any rule\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\for regulation issued under any such law.\"    29 U.S.C. § 1144(d).\n\nThe plain language of the statute exempts from preemption any\n\nfederal law, and any rule or regulation issued under federal law.\n\nVNA asserts that the Manual, as a whole or in part, is not a valid\n\nrule or regulation issued under federal law, and hence it is not\n\nprotected from ERISA preemption.5\n\n            VNA's reliance on ERISA is again misguided.     If the\n\nprovisions of the Manual at issue are invalid on the basis of\n\nfamiliar administrative law principles (which Plaintiff contends),\n\nthey would not apply to the Plan on that basis alone, irrespective\n\nof ERISA.    If the provisions are valid, they are protected from\n\nERISA preemption.6   Thus, the critical question in this appeal is\n\nwhether the particular sections of the PRM relied on by the\n\nAdministrator are valid rules of the Secretary.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       In its appellate brief, VNA seems to challenge the Manual,\nwhich is comprised of many provisions, as a single rule.        The\nrelevant cases that we have found involve challenges to a\nparticular section or provision of the Manual. See, e.g., Shalala\nv. Guernsey Mem'l Hosp., 514 U.S. 87 (1995). Given the focus of\nPlaintiff on the sections of the Manual that the Administrator\napplied -- PRM §§ 2140.1-2140.3, the sections regulating\nreimbursement of DCPs -- we interpret VNA's position as a challenge\nto the validity of the specific provisions of the Manual at issue.\n     6\n       Although Plaintiff argues that the provisions of the PRM are\nnot interpretive rules, the clearly are, as the ensuing discussion\ndemonstrates. See Shalala v. Guernsey Mem'l Hosp., 514 U.S. 87, 99\n(1995).\n\n                               -12-\n\f           In Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U.S. 87\n\n(1995), the Supreme Court found that § 233 of the Manual7 \"is a\n\nprototypical example of an interpretive rule issued by an agency to\n\nadvise the public of the agency's construction of the statutes and\n\nrules which it administers.\"         Id. at 99.     The Court continued:\n\n\"[i]nterpretive rules do not require notice and comment . . . they\n\nalso do not have the force and effect of law and are not accorded\n\nthat weight in the adjudicatory process.\"8        Id.    Finally, the Court\n\nheld that if § 233 had \"adopted a new position inconsistent with\n\nany of the Secretary's existing regulations,\" the APA's notice-and-\n\ncomment rulemaking process would be required.           Id. at 100.   So long\n\nas an interpretive rule does not \"effec[t] a substantive change in\n\nthe   regulations,\"   notice-and-comment    is    not    required     and   the\n\ninterpretive rule is valid.     Id.; see also Levesque v. Block, 723\n\nF.2d 175, 182 (1st. Cir. 1983) (citing Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323\n\nU.S. 134, 139-40 (1944)).\n\n           In   Christensen,   the    Supreme    Court    \"confront[ed]     an\n\ninterpretation contained in an opinion letter, not one arrived at\n\n\n\n\n      7\n       Section 233 of the PRM describes the way in which a cost\nassociated with capital indebtedness should be recognized, \"whether\nthe loss should be recognized at once or spread over a period of\nyears.\"   Guernsey, 514 U.S. at 97.     Section 233 requires that\n\"defeasance losses should be amortized.\" Id.\n      8\n       There is no dispute that the provisions of the Manual were\nnot subject to the notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures of the\nAPA.\n\n                                 -13-\n\fafter, for example, a formal adjudication or notice-and-comment\n\nrulemaking.\"       529 U.S. at 587.      The Court concluded that:\n\n       [I]nterpretations contained in policy statements, agency\n       manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which lack\n       the force of law -- do not warrant Chevron-style\n       deference. Instead, interpretations contained in formats\n       such as opinion letters are \"entitled to respect\" under\n       our decision in Skidmore v. Swift & Co., but only to the\n       extent that those interpretations have the \"power to\n       persuade.\"\n\nId. (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).                  While it is\n\ntrue that rules found in manuals such as the PRM are entitled to\n\nless deference than interpretations arrived at after a formal\n\nadjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking, this does not mean\n\nthat the rules in the Manual are not entitled to any deference at\n\nall.     If   an    interpretive    rule     is    neither    inconsistent        with\n\npromulgated regulations, nor outside of the coverage of the Act, it\n\nis valid.      Furthermore, as the Supreme Court stated in Thomas\n\nJefferson University v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504 (1994), \"broad\n\ndeference [to the administrative agency] is all the more warranted\n\nwhen,    as   here,   the   regulation     concerns    a     complex    and   highly\n\ntechnical regulatory program.\"         Id. at 512 (internal citations and\n\nquotation marks omitted); see also Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452\n\n(1997)    (holding    that   an    agency's       interpretation       of   its   own\n\nambiguous regulation is entitled to deference); Bowles v. Seminole\n\nRock & Sand Co., 325 U.S. 410 (1945). Medicare certainly qualifies\n\nas such a \"technical regulatory program\".\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\f             Plaintiff challenges the contention that §§ 2140.1-2140.3\n\nof    the   PRM   are     valid    interpretive       rules    whose    requirements\n\ndetermine whether contributions to a DCP were necessary, proper,\n\nand reasonable -- and therefore reimbursable -- under the Medicare\n\nAct and its implementing regulations.                 Section 2140.2 of the PRM\n\nstates:\n\n       Provider contributions for the benefit of employees under\n       a deferred compensation plan are reimbursable when, and\n       to the extent that, such costs are actually incurred by\n       the provider. Such costs are found to have been incurred\n       only if the requirements of sections 2140ff[]9 are met .\n       . . .      Provider payments under unfunded deferred\n       compensation plans are considered an allowable cost only\n       when actually paid to the particular employee and only to\n       the extent considered reasonable.\n\n(Footnote added.)         Under PRM § 2140.3, a provider must also:\n\n       [a]dequately communicate the proposed plan to all\n       eligible employees, enabling them to make an informed\n       decision on whether to participate in the plan. A formal\n       plan is one that is provided for in a written agreement\n       executed between the provider and the participating\n       employees.\n\nAdditionally, the plan must be a \"permanent\" one that: (1) details\n\nthe    method     for     calculating     all    contributions         to   the    fund\n\nestablished       under    the    plan;   (2)    is   funded    according     to    the\n\nrequirements of section 2140.3B;10 (3) designates how the plan's\n\n\n       9\n       \"[S]ections 2140ff\" refers to Section 2140 in its entirety,\nfrom §§ 2140.1-2140.6. Section 2140 is the entire portion of the\nPRM dealing with deferred compensation.\n       10\n       Section 2140.3B, entitled \"Funding of Deferred Compensation\nPlans\", describes in detail the recognized ways of funding a DCP,\nincluding commercial insurance, trust funds, and custodial bank\naccounts.\n\n                                          -15-\n\fassets are to be protected; (4) provides the requirements for\n\nbenefits to vest; (5) gives the basis for the compensation of the\n\namount of the benefits to be paid; and (6) will continue regardless\n\nof normal fluctuations in the provider's economic experience.             PRM\n\n§ 2140.3.\n\n            Insofar as these sections effect neither a substantive\n\nchange in the regulations nor the Medicare Act, they constitute\n\nvalid interpretive rules.       While neither the Medicare Act nor the\n\nsubsequent regulations specify the requirements for DCPs, this\n\nomission does not mean that there can be no such requirements.                In\n\nGuernsey, the Court stated that \"[w]e also believe it was proper\n\nfor the Secretary to issue a guideline or interpretive rule\" in the\n\nform of a section of the PRM.          514 U.S. at 97.\n\n            The Medicare Act states that \"[t]he reasonable cost of\n\nany   services   shall   be   the   cost      actually   incurred,   excluding\n\ntherefrom any part of incurred cost found to be unnecessary in the\n\nefficient   delivery     of   needed    health   services.\"     42   U.S.C.   §\n\n1395x(v)(1)(A).    The Act grants the Secretary broad discretion in\n\ndetermining what is a \"reasonable cost\" under the Act, 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1395x(v)(1)(A) (\"In prescribing the regulations referred to in the\n\npreceding sentence, the Secretary shall consider . . . .\"), and in\n\ndetermining what information is required from providers as a\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fcondition of payment, 42 U.S.C. § 1395g(a).11           The statute provides\n\na broad definition of \"reasonable cost\":\n\n      The reasonable cost of any services shall be the cost\n      actually incurred, excluding therefrom any part of\n      incurred cost found to be unnecessary in the efficient\n      delivery of needed health services, and shall be\n      determined in accordance with regulations establishing\n      the method or methods to be used, and the items to be\n      included, in determining such costs for various types or\n      classes of institutions, agencies, and services. . . .\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1395x(v)(1)(A).\n\n              Regulations promulgated by the Secretary to implement the\n\nAct   state    that    reimbursement    of    these   costs    is    \"subject     to\n\nprinciples relating to specific items of revenue and cost.\"                      42\n\nC.F.R. § 413.9(a).        The burden of proof is on the provider seeking\n\nreimbursement     to     demonstrate   whether    a   cost    is    eligible     for\n\nreimbursement. 42 C.F.R. §§ 413.20, 413.24. Payments to providers\n\n\"must be based on the reasonable cost of services covered under\n\nMedicare and related to the care of beneficiaries.\"                   42 C.F.R. §\n\n413.9(a).        Additionally,    providers      must   maintain          sufficient\n\nfinancial      records     and   statistical     data    for        the     accurate\n\ndetermination of reimbursable costs for services to beneficiaries\n\n\n      11\n           42 U.S.C. § 1395g(a) states in relevant part:\n\n      The Secretary shall periodically determine the amount\n      which should be paid under this part to each provider of\n      services with respect to the services furnished by it .\n      . . . [N]o such payments shall be made to any provider\n      unless it has furnished such information as the Secretary\n      may request in order to determine the amounts due such\n      provider under this part for the period with respect to\n      which the amounts are being paid or any prior period.\n\n                                       -17-\n\fusing \"[s]tandardized definitions, accounting, statistics, and\n\nreporting practices that are widely accepted in the hospital and\n\nrelated fields.\"        42 C.F.R. § 413.20(a).\n\n            Given the enormous variety of payments to providers that\n\nthe Secretary considers in making reimbursement decisions, the\n\nregulations that the Secretary has issued to explain \"reasonable\n\ncost\" use general language by necessity.              For example, 42 C.F.R. §\n\n413.9 defines \"necessary and proper costs\", the type of costs at\n\nissue    here,    as:   \"costs   that    are    appropriate    and   helpful     in\n\ndeveloping and maintaining the operation of patient care facilities\n\nand activities.         They are usually costs that are common and\n\naccepted occurrences in the field of the provider's activity.\"                   To\n\ngive content to the concept of reasonable cost, the Manual details\n\nthe specifics of reimbursement.\n\n            The deferred plan specifications found in the Manual,\n\nspecifically §§ 2140.1-2140.3, do not contradict or conflict with\n\nthe     requirements     articulated     in     the   Medicare   Act     and    its\n\nregulations.       They detail the requirements for determining and\n\nconfirming       reasonable   costs     under    a    DCP,    pursuant    to    the\n\nrequirements of the regulations.          These interpretive rules are not\n\nbeyond the pale of what other courts have found acceptable.                    See,\n\ne.g., Cmty Hosp. of Monterey Peninsula v. Thompson, 323 F.3d 782,\n\n790-93 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that the PRM's allowable debt\n\nreimbursements were neither arbitrary nor capricious); Mt. Sinai\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fHosp. Med. Ctr. v. Shalala, 196 F.3d 703, 709 (7th Cir. 1999)\n\n(concluding that PRM requirements that mandate providers collect\n\nMedicare     and   non-Medicare     debts      with    the     same      methods    were\n\nreasonable and not violative of the APA); see also Creighton Omaha\n\nReg'l. Health Care Corp. v. Bowen, 822 F.2d 785 (8th Cir. 1987);\n\nSt. Mary's Hosp. of Troy v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield Assoc., 788\n\nF.2d 888 (2d Cir. 1986).          These courts accorded deference to the\n\nSecretary's interpretive provisions contained in the Manual, and\n\nupheld disallowances of Medicare costs based on those provisions,\n\ndespite the fact that those provisions were not expressly stated in\n\nthe regulations.\n\n             We conclude that §§ 2140.1-2140.3 are valid interpretive\n\nrules.       As    a   result,    the   Plan    must        satisfy      the   specific\n\nrequirements found in these provisions in order to qualify for\n\nreimbursement.\n\nC.    The Administrator's decision\n\n             Finally, using the reasoning of the Board, Plaintiff\n\ncontests     the       district    court's      decision           to     affirm     the\n\nAdministrator's decision.         The Board reversed UGS's adjustments to\n\nVNA's    reimbursement,      reasoning      that      the    Plan       \"substantially\n\ncomplied\" with the Manual's requirements and any non-compliance of\n\nthe   Plan   to    the   requirements     set      forth      in    the    Manual   was\n\nde minimus.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\f            Plaintiff asserts that the strict application of the\n\nManual    is   inequitable,     and   that    the    Board's         more     relaxed\n\n\"substantial compliance\" approach is proper.             Here, we have found\n\nthe applicable sections of the Manual to be valid interpretive\n\nrules     implementing    the   Medicare      Act    and       the     Secretary's\n\nregulations.      The Secretary is charged with administering \"a\n\ncomplex and highly technical regulatory program in which the\n\nidentification and classification of relevant criteria necessarily\n\nrequire    significant    expertise     and   the   exercise         of     judgement\n\ngrounded in policy concerns.\"         Thomas Jefferson Univ., 512 U.S. at\n\n513 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).                  Because the\n\nmanner in which the Manual is implemented is so integral to its\n\noperation, it would be odd not to defer to the Secretary's method\n\nof applying those rules, as well as those rules themselves.                      We,\n\ntherefore,     find   Plaintiff's     objection     to   the    Administrator's\n\n\"strict application\" approach unpersuasive.              The district court's\n\nruling affirming the Administrator's decision was correct.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\f                        Appendix: Glossary\n\nName of Entity or      Acronym               Description\nDocument\nVisiting Nurse         VNA                   Plaintiff-Appellant\nAssociation                                  in this case\nCenters for Medicare   CMS                   Section of HHS that\nand Medicaid                                 administers\n                                             Medicare, and a\n                                             Defendant-Appellee\nUnited Government      UGS                   The intermediary\nServices                                     that performed the\n                                             initial audit of\n                                             VNA's deferred\n                                             compensation plan\nProvider               PRRB                  Entity that decides\nReimbursement Review                         appeals of initial\nBoard                                        reimbursement\n                                             decisions\nDeferred               DCP                   The type of employee\nCompensation Plan                            benefit plan at\n                                             issue in this case,\n                                             an arrangement in\n                                             which a portion of\n                                             an employee's income\n                                             is paid out at a\n                                             date after which\n                                             that income is\n                                             actually earned\nProvider               PRM                   Document at issue in\nReimbursement Manual                         this case,\n                                             containing the\n                                             Secretary's\n                                             guidelines for\n                                             implementing the\n                                             Medicare Act and\n                                             regulations,\n                                             including the\n                                             requirements a DCP\n                                             must meet in order\n                                             to be eligible for\n                                             reimbursement\n\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\f",

(\"Plaintiff\" or \"VNA\") is a non-profit corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> For the time period at issue here, VNA was a Home Care Medicare provider within the meaning of the Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395, <i>et seq.</i> Plaintiff owns three subsidiary providers in the Medicare program: VNA Hato Rey, VNA Bayam&#243;n, and VNA Carolina. Defendant-Appellee Tommy G. Thompson was the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Defendant-Appellee Ruben J. King-Shaw, Jr. is the Deputy Administrator and Chief Operating Officer of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). King-Shaw (the \"Administrator\") signed the CMS decision at issue here. Defendant-Appellee United Government Services (\"UGS\"), the intermediary between Medicare and Plaintiff, conducted the initial review of Plaintiff's cost reports discussed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1994, VNA instituted a Deferred Compensation Plan (\"Plan\" or \"DCP\") for its employees pursuant to which VNA paid a deferred \"salary differential\" for each employee participating in the Plan. Plaintiff claimed these contributions to the Plan as costs on its Medicare cost reports for fiscal years 1994-1997. UGS reviewed Plaintiff's cost reports for those fiscal years, determined that the Plan did not comply with Medicare rules and regulations, and disallowed reimbursement of costs in the amount of $353,521.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff appealed UGS's decision to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (\"PRRB\" or the \"Board\"), which held a hearing on November 19, 2001. On August 9, 2002, the Board reversed UGS's decision. The Board concluded that VNA was entitled to reimbursement for its contributions to the Plan, finding that: (1) UGS never informed VNA that the Plan was invalid; (2) VNA used outside advisors and consultants to establish the Plan; (3) the Plan's terms were contained in the personnel by-laws; and (4) VNA created the Plan intending it to be a permanent arrangement. In summary, the Board reversed UGS's decision on the grounds that the Plan was in \"substantial compliance\" with the provisions of the Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual (\"PRM\" or the \"Manual\"); and any non-compliance of the Plan from the requirements set forth in the Manual was <i>de minimus.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 16, 2002, pursuant to 42 C.F.R. &#167; 405.1875, which provides specifically for appeals from decisions of the Board, UGS requested a review of the Board's decision, alleging that the decision was contrary to the rules and standards contained in the Manual. On August 26, 2002, the Administrator notified the parties of its intention to review the Board's decision. VNA was also notified that the Administrator would issue his decision, which constitutes the Secretary's final decision, within sixty (60) days of VNA's receipt of the Board's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 8, 2002, the Administrator reversed the decision of the Board, finding that the Plan did not qualify as a formal DCP. Specifically, the Administrator found that VNA had not deposited its contributions with an appropriate funding agent; the Plan was contingent rather than permanent in nature; and the Plan did not meet the requirements for Medicare reimbursement as a formal DCP for the 1994-97 period. On October 10, 2002, the Administrator's decision was sent to VNA by certified mail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 3, 2002, VNA requested review of the Administrator's decision in federal district court pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 701-06. VNA eventually moved for summary judgment; Defendants opposed the motion and submitted a cross-motion for summary judgment. On September 30, 2004, the district court issued an order denying VNA's summary judgment motion and granting Defendants' motion, affirming the decision of the Secretary.

Daley,</i> 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir.1997). \"Because the APA standard affords great deference to agency decisionmaking and because the Secretary's action is presumed valid, judicial review, even at the summary judgment stage, is narrow.\" <i>Id.</i> Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395oo(f)(1), judicial review of the reimbursement decision is governed by the standards detailed in the APA. Thus, we may only set aside agency actions, findings, and conclusions if they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\" or \"unsupported by substantial evidence\". 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2). Substantial evidence means \"more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\" <i>Richardson v. Perales,</i> 402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). Additionally, in the situation here, the district court acts as an intermediate appellate court. Therefore, \"when reviewing agency action, we apply the same legal standards that pertain in the district court and afford no special deference to that court's decision.\" <i>Associated Fisheries,</i> 127 F.3d at 109.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, \"[w]here Congress has entrusted rulemaking and administrative authority to an agency, courts normally accord the agency particular deference in respect to the interpretation of regulations promulgated under that authority.\" <i>South Shore Hosp., Inc. v.

VNA asserts that the Administrator failed to make his decision within that 60-day period. As a result, VNA argues that the Board decision is final, and the Administrator's silence constitutes approval of the Board's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no factual dispute that: (1) the Board issued its decision on August 9, 2002; (2) the Administrator signed and dated his decision on October 8, 2002; and (3) the Administrator's decision was mailed to VNA on October 10, 2002. Plaintiff contends that 42 C.F.R. &#167; 405.1875(g)(2) requires the Administrator to make his decision <i>and</i> mail that decision within the 60-day window. The relevant dates for this proposition would be August 9, 2002, and October 10, 2002; sixty-one (61) days would have elapsed using this scenario. With the Secretary not having complied with the applicable time requirements, the Board's decision would be final.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Plaintiff's argument is predicated on an unnatural reading of the regulatory language. 42 C.F.R. &#167; 405.1875(g)(2) reads that \"the Administrator will make this decision within 60 days . . . and will promptly mail a copy.\" If the regulation required the Administrator to make his decision and mail it within 60 days, the regulation would have placed \"within 60 days\" at the end of the regulation. Then the 60-day period would apply to both the making of the decision and its mailing. However, the plain language of the regulation states that the Administrator need only <i>make his decision</i> within the 60-day period. He must then mail his decision promptly thereafter, which is what the Administrator did. The date the Administrator signed his decision is the appropriate date to use in calculating whether the Administrator complied with the 60-day period. Using that day, October 8, 2002, the Administrator made his decision in fifty-nine (59) days, within the 60-day period detailed in both the statute and the regulations. As a result, the CMS Administrator's decision was properly before the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Applicability of the Provider Reimbursement Manual</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff makes two attempts to avoid the applicability of the Manual to the Plan. VNA first argues that the Manual is just a \"codified interpretation\" of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"). Since the Plan complied with ERISA, according to Plaintiff, it was entitled to Medicare reimbursement. This argument is unsupported by any authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Manual anticipates different types of retirement plans that a Medicare provider may offer to its employees. In &#167;&#167; 2140.1-2140.6, the Manual sets forth the rules governing the broad category of retirement plan involved in this case &#8212; the deferred compensation plan. In subsequent sections, specifically &#167;&#167; 2141.1-2141.7 and &#167;&#167; 2142.1-2142.7, the Manual sets forth the rules governing two subcategories of a DCP, the \"defined contribution deferred compensation plan\" and the \"pension plan\", respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of its position that the PRM \"codifies\" ERISA, Plaintiff asserts that \"[n]owhere in the PRM is a conceptual link between said Manual and ERISA more clearly suggested and easily apparent, than in Section 2141.1 of the PRM.\" In &#167; 2141.1, the Manual states in relevant part that: \"Defined contribution deferred compensation plans include profit sharing, stock bonus, and other such defined contribution deferred compensation plans that meet Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") or [ERISA] requirements as qualified plans and have been so approved by the IRS.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, &#167; 2141.1 defines the DCP subcategory of \"defined contribution deferred compensation plans\" only; the Plan at issue here does not fall into that category. As noted, the Plan at issue here falls into the general category of a deferred compensation plan, which is governed by &#167;&#167; 2140.1-2140.6. Those sections do not refer to ERISA. Second, and more importantly, the reference to ERISA in &#167; 2141.1 is only used to distinguish a deferred compensation plan that qualifies as a \"defined contribution deferred compensation plan\" from one that does not. Even for the defined contribution deferred compensation plan, there is no suggestion that the PRM is simply a codified interpretation of ERISA. Indeed, whether for a \"regular\" deferred compensation plan or for a defined contribution deferred compensation plan, the question of Medicare reimbursement would be determined by the Medicare Act and its related regulations, not ERISA. ERISA is irrelevant to the issue of Medicare reimbursement for contributions to a DCP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a second attempt to avoid the applicability of the Manual to the Plan, Plaintiff argues that the Manual was preempted by ERISA. ERISA states in relevant part that \"[n]othing in this subchapter shall be construed to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or supersede any law of the United States . . . or any rule or regulation issued under any such law.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(d). The plain language of the statute exempts from preemption any federal law, and any rule or regulation issued under federal law. VNA asserts that the Manual, as a whole or in part, is not a valid rule or regulation issued under federal law, and hence it is not protected from ERISA preemption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VNA's reliance on ERISA is again misguided. If the provisions of the Manual at issue are invalid on the basis of familiar administrative law principles (which Plaintiff contends), they would not apply to the Plan on that basis alone, irrespective of ERISA. If the provisions are valid, they are protected from ERISA preemption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Thus, the critical question in this appeal is whether the particular sections of the PRM relied on by the Administrator are valid rules of the Secretary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital,</i> 514 U.S. 87, 115 S.Ct. 1232, 131 L.Ed.2d 106 (1995), the Supreme Court found that &#167; 233 of the Manual<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> \"is a prototypical example of an interpretive rule issued by an agency to advise the public of the agency's construction of the statutes and rules which it administers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 99, 115 S.Ct. 1232. The Court continued: \"[i]nterpretive rules do not require notice and comment . . . they also do not have the force and effect of law and are not accorded that weight in the adjudicatory process.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>Id.</i> Finally, the Court held that if &#167; 233 had \"adopted a new position inconsistent with any of the Secretary's existing regulations,\" the APA's notice-and-comment rulemaking process would be required. <i>Id.</i> at 100, 115 S.Ct. 1232. So long as an interpretive rule does not \"effec[t] a substantive change in the regulations,\" notice-and-comment is not required and the interpretive rule is valid. <i>Id.; see also Levesque v. Block,</i> 723 F.2d 175, 182 (1st. Cir.1983) (citing <i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> 323 U.S. 134, 139-40, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Christensen,</i> the Supreme Court \"confront[ed] an interpretation contained in an opinion letter, not one arrived at after, for example, a formal adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking.\" 529 U.S. at 587, 120 S.Ct. 1655. The Court concluded that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]nterpretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which lack the force of law &#8212; do not warrant <i>Chevron</i>-style deference. Instead, interpretations contained in formats such as opinion letters are \"entitled to respect\" under our decision in <i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> but only to the extent that those interpretations have the \"power to persuade.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). While it is true that rules found in manuals such as the PRM are entitled to less deference than interpretations arrived at after a formal adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking, this does not mean that the rules in the Manual are not entitled to any deference at all. If an interpretive rule is neither inconsistent with promulgated regulations, nor outside of the coverage of the Act, it is valid. Furthermore, as the Supreme Court stated in <i>Thomas Jefferson University v. Shalala,</i> 512 U.S. 504, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994), \"broad deference [to the administrative agency] is all the more warranted when, as here, the regulation concerns a complex and highly technical regulatory program.\" <i>Id.</i> at 512, 114 S.Ct. 2381 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Auer v. Robbins,</i> 519 U.S. 452, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997) (holding that an agency's interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation is entitled to deference); <i>Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co.,</i> 325 U.S. 410, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945). Medicare certainly qualifies as such a \"technical regulatory program\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff challenges the contention that &#167;&#167; 2140.1-2140.3 of the PRM are valid interpretive rules whose requirements determine whether contributions to a DCP were necessary, proper, and reasonable &#8212; and therefore reimbursable &#8212; under the Medicare Act and its implementing regulations. Section 2140.2 of the PRM states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Provider contributions for the benefit of employees under a deferred compensation plan are reimbursable when, and to the extent that, such costs are actually incurred by the provider. Such costs are found to have been incurred only if the requirements of sections 2140ff[]<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> are met. . . . Provider payments under unfunded deferred compensation plans are considered an allowable cost only when actually paid to the particular employee and only to the extent considered reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Footnote added.) Under PRM &#167; 2140.3, a provider must also:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]dequately communicate the proposed plan to all eligible employees, enabling them to make an informed decision on whether to participate in the plan. A formal plan is one that is provided for in a written agreement executed between the provider and the participating employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the plan must be a \"permanent\" one that: (1) details the method for calculating all contributions to the fund established under the plan; (2) is funded according to the requirements of section 2140.3B;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> (3) designates how the plan's assets are to be protected; (4) provides the requirements for benefits to vest; (5) gives the basis for the compensation of the amount of the benefits to be paid; and (6) will continue regardless of normal fluctuations in the provider's economic experience.

While neither the Medicare Act nor the subsequent regulations specify the requirements for DCPs, this omission does not mean that there can be no such requirements. In <i>Guernsey,</i> the Court stated that \"[w]e also believe it was proper for the Secretary to issue a guideline or interpretive rule\" in the form of a section of the PRM. 514 U.S. at 97, 115 S.Ct. 1232.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Medicare Act states that \"[t]he reasonable cost of any services shall be the cost actually incurred, excluding therefrom any part of incurred cost found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x(v)(1)(A). The Act grants the Secretary broad discretion in determining what is a \"reasonable cost\" under the Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x(v)(1)(A) (\"In prescribing the regulations referred to in the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall consider. . . .\"), and in determining what information is required from providers as a condition of payment, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395g(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The statute provides a broad definition of \"reasonable cost\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasonable cost of any services shall be the cost actually incurred, excluding therefrom any part of incurred cost found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services, and shall be determined in accordance with regulations establishing the method or methods to be used, and the items to be included, in determining such costs for various types or classes of institutions, agencies, and services. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x(v)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regulations promulgated by the Secretary to implement the Act state that reimbursement of these costs is \"subject to principles relating to specific items of revenue and cost.\" 42 C.F.R. &#167; 413.9(a). The burden of proof is on the provider seeking reimbursement to demonstrate whether a cost is eligible for reimbursement. 42 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 413.20, 413.24. Payments to providers \"must be based on the reasonable cost of services covered under Medicare and related to the care of beneficiaries.\" 42 C.F.R. &#167; 413.9(a). Additionally, providers must maintain sufficient financial records and statistical data for the accurate determination of reimbursable costs for services to beneficiaries using \"[s]tandardized definitions, accounting, statistics, and reporting practices that are widely accepted in the hospital and related fields.\" 42 C.F.R. &#167; 413.20(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the enormous variety of payments to providers that the Secretary considers in making reimbursement decisions, the regulations that the Secretary has issued to explain \"reasonable cost\" use general language by necessity. For example, 42 C.F.R. &#167; 413.9 defines \"necessary and proper costs\", the type of costs at issue here, as: \"costs that are appropriate and helpful in developing and maintaining the operation of patient care facilities and activities. They are usually costs that are common and accepted occurrences in the field of the provider's activity.\" To give content to the concept of reasonable cost, the Manual details the specifics of reimbursement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deferred plan specifications found in the Manual, specifically &#167;&#167; 2140.1-2140.3, do not contradict or conflict with the requirements articulated in the Medicare Act and its regulations. They detail the requirements for determining and confirming reasonable costs under a DCP, pursuant to the requirements of the regulations. These interpretive rules are not beyond the pale of what other courts have found acceptable. <i>See, e.g., Cmty Hosp. of Monterey Peninsula v. Thompson,</i> 323 F.3d 782, 790-93 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that the PRM's allowable debt reimbursements were neither arbitrary nor capricious); <i>Mt. Sinai Hosp. Med. Ctr. v. Shalala,</i> 196 F.3d 703, 709 (7th Cir.1999) (concluding that PRM requirements that mandate providers collect Medicare and non-Medicare debts with the same methods were reasonable and not violative of the APA); <i>see also Creighton Omaha Reg'l. Health Care Corp. v. Bowen,</i> 822 F.2d 785 (8th Cir. 1987); <i>St. Mary's Hosp. of Troy v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield Assoc.,</i> 788 F.2d 888 (2d Cir.1986). These courts accorded deference to the Secretary's interpretive provisions contained in the Manual, and upheld disallowances of Medicare costs based on those provisions, despite the fact that those provisions were not expressly stated in the regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that &#167;&#167; 2140.1-2140.3 are valid interpretive rules. As a result, the Plan must satisfy the specific requirements found in these provisions in order to qualify for reimbursement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Administrator's decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, using the reasoning of the Board, Plaintiff contests the district court's decision to affirm the Administrator's decision. The Board reversed UGS's adjustments to VNA's reimbursement, reasoning that the Plan \"substantially complied\" with the Manual's requirements and any non-compliance of the Plan to the requirements set forth in the Manual was <i>de minimus.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff asserts that the strict application of the Manual is inequitable, and that the Board's more relaxed \"substantial compliance\" approach is proper. Here, we have found the applicable sections of the Manual to be valid interpretive rules implementing the Medicare Act and the Secretary's regulations. The Secretary is charged with administering \"a complex and highly technical regulatory program in which the identification and classification of relevant criteria necessarily require significant expertise and the exercise of judgement grounded in policy concerns.\" <i>Thomas Jefferson Univ.,</i> 512 U.S. at 513, 114 S.Ct. 2381 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Because the manner in which the Manual is implemented is so integral to its operation, it would be odd not to defer to the Secretary's method of applying those rules, as well as those rules themselves. We, therefore, find Plaintiff's objection to the Administrator's \"strict application\" approach unpersuasive. The district court's ruling affirming the Administrator's decision was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <pre>                            <i>Appendix:</i> Glossary\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<i>Name of Entity or Document        Acronym          Description</i>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVisiting Nurse Association        VNA              Plaintiff-Appellant in this case\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <pre>Centers for Medicare              CMS               Section of HHS that administers\nand Medicaid                                        Medicare, and a Defendant-Appellee\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnited Government Services        UGS               The intermediary that performed\n                                                    the initial audit of VNA's deferred\n                                                    compensation plan\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProvider Reimbursement            PRRB              Entity that decides appeals of initial\nReview Board                                        reimbursement decisions\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeferred Compensation Plan        DCP               The type of employee benefit plan\n                                                    at issue in this case, an arrangement\n                                                    in which a portion of an\n                                                    employee's income is paid out at a\n                                                    date after which that income is\n                                                    actually earned\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProvider Reimbursement Manual     PRM               Document at issue in this case,\n                                                    containing the Secretary's guidelines\n                                                    for implementing the Medicare\n                                                    Act and regulations, including\n                                                    the requirements a DCP must\n                                                    meet in order to be eligible for\n                                                    reimbursement\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This area of law is rife with the use of acronyms.

Plaintiff claimed these contributions to the Plan as costs on its Medicare cost reports for fiscal years 1994-1997. UGS reviewed Plaintiff's cost reports for those fiscal years, determined that the Plan did not comply with Medicare rules and regulations, and disallowed reimbursement of costs in the amount of $353,521.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff appealed UGS's decision to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (\"PRRB\" or the \"Board\"), which held a hearing on November 19, 2001. On August 9, 2002, the Board reversed UGS's decision. The Board concluded that VNA was entitled to reimbursement for its contributions to the Plan, finding that: (1) UGS never informed VNA that the Plan was invalid; (2) VNA used outside advisors and consultants to establish the Plan; (3) the Plan's terms were contained in the personnel by-laws; and (4) VNA created the Plan intending it to be a permanent arrangement. In summary, the Board reversed UGS's decision on the grounds that the Plan was in \"substantial compliance\" with the provisions of the Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual (\"PRM\" or the \"Manual\"); and any non-compliance of the Plan from the requirements set forth in the Manual was <i>de minimus.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 16, 2002, pursuant to 42 C.F.R. &#167; 405.1875, which provides specifically for appeals from decisions of the Board, UGS requested a review of the Board's decision, alleging that the decision was contrary to the rules and standards contained in the Manual.

VNA asserts that the Administrator failed to make his decision within that 60-day period. As a result, VNA argues that the Board decision is final, and the Administrator's silence constitutes approval of the Board's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no factual dispute that: (1) the Board issued its decision on August 9, 2002; (2) the Administrator signed and dated his decision on October 8, 2002; and (3) the Administrator's decision was mailed to VNA on October 10, 2002. Plaintiff contends that 42 C.F.R. &#167; 405.1875(g)(2) requires the Administrator to make his decision <i>and</i> mail that decision within the 60-day window. The relevant dates for this proposition would be August 9, 2002, and October 10, 2002; sixty-one (61) days would have elapsed using this scenario. With the Secretary not having complied with the applicable time requirements, the Board's decision would be final.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Plaintiff's argument is predicated on an unnatural reading of the regulatory language. 42 C.F.R. &#167; 405.1875(g)(2) reads that \"the Administrator will make this decision within 60 days . . . and will promptly mail a copy.\" If the regulation required the Administrator to make his decision and mail it within 60 days, the regulation would have placed \"within 60 days\" at the end of the regulation. Then the 60-day period would apply to both the making of the decision and its mailing. However, the plain language of the regulation states that the Administrator need only <i>make his decision</i> within the 60-day period. He must then mail his decision promptly thereafter, which is what the Administrator did. The date the Administrator signed his decision is the appropriate date to use in calculating whether the Administrator complied with the 60-day period. Using that day, October 8, 2002, the Administrator made his decision in fifty-nine (59) days, within the 60-day period detailed in both the statute and the regulations. As a result, the CMS Administrator's decision was properly before the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Applicability of the Provider Reimbursement Manual</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff makes two attempts to avoid the applicability of the Manual to the Plan. VNA first argues that the Manual is just a \"codified interpretation\" of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"). Since the Plan complied with ERISA, according to Plaintiff, it was entitled to Medicare reimbursement. This argument is unsupported by any authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Manual anticipates different types of retirement plans that a Medicare provider may offer to its employees. In &#167;&#167; 2140.1-2140.6, the Manual sets forth the rules governing the broad category of retirement plan involved in this case &#8212; the deferred compensation plan. In subsequent sections, specifically &#167;&#167; 2141.1-2141.7 and &#167;&#167; 2142.1-2142.7, the Manual sets forth the rules governing two subcategories of a DCP, the \"defined contribution deferred compensation plan\" and the \"pension plan\", respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of its position that the PRM \"codifies\" ERISA, Plaintiff asserts that \"[n]owhere in the PRM is a conceptual link between said Manual and ERISA more clearly suggested and easily apparent, than in Section 2141.1 of the PRM.\" In &#167; 2141.1, the Manual states in relevant part that: \"Defined contribution deferred compensation plans include profit sharing, stock bonus, and other such defined contribution deferred compensation plans that meet Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") or [ERISA] requirements as qualified plans and have been so approved by the IRS.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, &#167; 2141.1 defines the DCP subcategory of \"defined contribution deferred compensation plans\" only; the Plan at issue here does not fall into that category. As noted, the Plan at issue here falls into the general category of a deferred compensation plan, which is governed by &#167;&#167; 2140.1-2140.6. Those sections do not refer to ERISA. Second, and more importantly, the reference to ERISA in &#167; 2141.1 is only used to distinguish a deferred compensation plan that qualifies as a \"defined contribution deferred compensation plan\" from one that does not. Even for the defined contribution deferred compensation plan, there is no suggestion that the PRM is simply a codified interpretation of ERISA. Indeed, whether for a \"regular\" deferred compensation plan or for a defined contribution deferred compensation plan, the question of Medicare reimbursement would be determined by the Medicare Act and its related regulations, not ERISA. ERISA is irrelevant to the issue of Medicare reimbursement for contributions to a DCP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a second attempt to avoid the applicability of the Manual to the Plan, Plaintiff argues that the Manual was preempted by ERISA. ERISA states in relevant part that \"[n]othing in this subchapter shall be construed to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or supersede any law of the United States . . . or any rule or regulation issued under any such law.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(d). The plain language of the statute exempts from preemption any federal law, and any rule or regulation issued under federal law. VNA asserts that the Manual, as a whole or in part, is not a valid rule or regulation issued under federal law, and hence it is not protected from ERISA preemption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VNA's reliance on ERISA is again misguided. If the provisions of the Manual at issue are invalid on the basis of familiar administrative law principles (which Plaintiff contends), they would not apply to the Plan on that basis alone, irrespective of ERISA. If the provisions are valid, they are protected from ERISA preemption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Thus, the critical question in this appeal is whether the particular sections of the PRM relied on by the Administrator are valid rules of the Secretary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Shalala v.

These courts accorded deference to the Secretary's interpretive provisions contained in the Manual, and upheld disallowances of Medicare costs based on those provisions, despite the fact that those provisions were not expressly stated in the regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that &#167;&#167; 2140.1-2140.3 are valid interpretive rules. As a result, the Plan must satisfy the specific requirements found in these provisions in order to qualify for reimbursement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Administrator's decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, using the reasoning of the Board, Plaintiff contests the district court's decision to affirm the Administrator's decision. The Board reversed UGS's adjustments to VNA's reimbursement, reasoning that the Plan \"substantially complied\" with the Manual's requirements and any non-compliance of the Plan to the requirements set forth in the Manual was <i>de minimus.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff asserts that the strict application of the Manual is inequitable, and that the Board's more relaxed \"substantial compliance\" approach is proper. Here, we have found the applicable sections of the Manual to be valid interpretive rules implementing the Medicare Act and the Secretary's regulations. The Secretary is charged with administering \"a complex and highly technical regulatory program in which the identification and classification of relevant criteria necessarily require significant expertise and the exercise of judgement grounded in policy concerns.\" <i>Thomas Jefferson Univ.,</i> 512 U.S. at 513, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117865\"><a href=\"/opinion/117865/thomas-jefferson-univ-v-shalala/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2381</span></a></span> (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Because the manner in which the Manual is implemented is so integral to its operation, it would be odd not to defer to the Secretary's method of applying those rules, as well as those rules themselves. We, therefore, find Plaintiff's objection to the Administrator's \"strict application\" approach unpersuasive. The district court's ruling affirming the Administrator's decision was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <pre>                            <i>Appendix:</i> Glossary\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<i>Name of Entity or Document        Acronym          Description</i>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVisiting Nurse Association        VNA              Plaintiff-Appellant in this case\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <pre>Centers for Medicare              CMS               Section of HHS that administers\nand Medicaid                                        Medicare, and a Defendant-Appellee\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnited Government Services        UGS               The intermediary that performed\n                                                    the initial audit of VNA's deferred\n                                                    compensation plan\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProvider Reimbursement            PRRB              Entity that decides appeals of initial\nReview Board                                        reimbursement decisions\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeferred Compensation Plan        DCP               The type of employee benefit plan\n                                                    at issue in this case, an arrangement\n                                                    in which a portion of an\n                                                    employee's income is paid out at a\n                                                    date after which that income is\n                                                    actually earned\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProvider Reimbursement Manual     PRM               Document at issue in this case,\n                                                    containing the Secretary's guidelines\n                                                    for implementing the Medicare\n                                                    Act and regulations, including\n                                                    the requirements a DCP must\n                                                    meet in order to be eligible for\n                                                    reimbursement\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This area of law is rife with the use of acronyms.

In that case, we assumed that a mailing took four days. <i>Id.</i> In light of <i>Hospital San Jorge,</i> the district court found Defendants' alternative timing argument also valid.
