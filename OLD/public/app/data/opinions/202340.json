Linzy, with whom The Kullman Firm was on brief, for\nHolsum de Puerto Rico.\n     Amy H. Ginn, with whom Meredith L. Jason, Supervisory\nAttorney, was on brief, for the Board.\n\n\n\n                           August 8, 2006\n\n\n\n\n____________\n     *\n         Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.           As a result of the company's\n\nresponse to a union organizing campaign, the United Auto Workers\n\nInternational Union filed an unfair labor practices charge against\n\nHolsum de Puerto Rico, Inc. General Counsel for the National Labor\n\nRelations Board then commenced a regulatory enforcement action.\n\nAfter extensive testimony, an administrative law judge determined\n\nthat   Holsum   had   engaged   in   unfair    labor   practices   and   had\n\nterminated employees illegally.           See 29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(1)-(3).\n\nWith a slight exception not important here, the Board adopted the\n\njudge's findings and conclusions as its own.            Before us, Holsum\n\ndoes not contest most of the Board's findings.           However, it does\n\npetition for review of the Board's conclusion that José Torres, a\n\nleader of the unionization effort, was fired as a sanction for his\n\nprotected activity, and the Board's related order that Torres be\n\nreinstated to his job at Holsum.           The Board cross-petitions for\n\nenforcement of its entire order.          We reject Holsum's petition and\n\ngrant the Board's.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           We review the background facts as the Board found them,\n\nfocusing on the facts involving Torres.          Most of these facts are\n\nnot disputed here.1     Holsum is a commercial bakery, selling bread\n\n\n1\n  While Holsum only contests the Board's order as it relates to\nTorres, the company does argue that the evidence before the Board\nwas insufficient to support a finding of anti-union animus. Holsum\nalso makes a cursory argument that there was no causal connection\nbetween any such animus and Torres's termination.            These\n\n                                     -2-\n\fand other products to retailers in Puerto Rico.                Torres and José\n\nSantiago were salesmen for Holsum.            Their duties included driving\n\ncompany trucks and delivering baked goods to clients.                       In the\n\nsummer of 2002, Torres, Santiago, and some other Holsum salespeople\n\nbegan to talk about forming a union.           From the beginning, Santiago\n\ntook the lead in scheduling meetings, and Torres led the drive to\n\nrecruit other salespeople to join the union.              Initially, Torres\n\nrecruited    other    employees    informally.      By   the   fall    of    2002,\n\nhowever, Torres had begun handing out union authorization cards and\n\ntelling his coworkers that \"the union could better represent their\n\ninterests.\"\n\n            Holsum had a \"union avoidance policy,\" and its management\n\nquickly     began    observing    and    discouraging    the     salespeople's\n\nunionization campaign.           Private investigators working for the\n\ncompany observed one of the early organizational meetings.                   Then,\n\nin September 2002, Holsum's president, Ramón Calderón, sent a\n\nletter to his employees stating that a group of dissatisfied\n\nemployees had \"attacked\" the company, creating \"a serious threat to\n\nyour job, your future and the future of your family.\"                 The letter\n\n-- which the Board did not find was improper in and of itself but\n\nwhich surely shows the company's feelings about the unionization\n\neffort -- concluded by instructing employees to read and abide by\n\n\n\nundeveloped arguments, which are plainly belied by the evidence,\nare too insubstantial to warrant discussion.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthe company's \"union avoidance policy,\" and to say \"'NO' to the\n\nunion agitators.\"\n\n          Shortly after this letter was sent, Holsum supervisors\n\nconfronted Torres, Santiago, and several other employees to ask\n\nthem what they thought about the letter.        These inquiries, in\n\ncombination with other facts, led the Board to conclude that the\n\ncompany had illegally interrogated its workers.     When Torres was\n\ninterrogated about the letter, the conversation quickly became\n\nantagonistic.    Torres refused to tell his supervisor what he\n\nthought of the letter, the supervisor persisted in his questioning,\n\nand ultimately Torres told the supervisor that he could not answer\n\nwithout \"compromis[ing] himself.\"     The acrimonious interrogation\n\ndid not stop Torres's efforts on behalf of the nascent union.\n\nUntil his discharge in the spring of 2003, Torres spent \"almost\n\nevery afternoon\" in the company parking lot, soliciting his fellow\n\nemployees to sign union authorization cards.\n\n          In April 2003, Torres was fired.    Holsum maintains that\n\nit terminated Torres because he violated the company's rule against\n\nletting non-employees ride in company trucks.    Crediting Torres's\n\nuncontradicted account, the Board found that one day in late April\n\na man jumped into Torres's truck while Torres was waiting for a\n\ntraffic light to change.   Torres told the stranger to get out of\n\nthe truck.   The passenger refused to leave and demanded a ride to\n\nthe next traffic light (in the direction Torres was traveling).\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fTorres insisted that the person leave the truck and told him that\n\nhe was prohibited by company policy from transporting passengers.\n\nStill, the passenger would not get out, and Torres would not have\n\nbeen able to remove him without resorting to physical force.   The\n\nlight changed, and cars behind the truck started honking.   Torres\n\ndecided that it would be better to transport his unwanted passenger\n\na short distance than to have a physical fight with him in the\n\nmiddle of an intersection.   The passenger jumped out of the truck\n\nwhen he reached his intended destination, and Torres continued on\n\nhis route.\n\n          A Holsum supervisor observed the unwanted passenger's\n\nbrief ride on Torres's truck.    When Torres returned to Holsum's\n\nwarehouse, another supervisor told him that he had been seen with\n\nan unauthorized passenger. The supervisor asked Torres to fill out\n\na written report describing the incident.    Torres did as he was\n\nasked.   When Torres arrived at work the next day, two supervisors\n\nconfronted him and told him that he was suspended without wages or\n\nhealth benefits.   The supervisors also instructed Torres to return\n\nto the plant the following week for a hearing.\n\n          The next week, Torres arrived at the plant at the time he\n\nhad been told to come, bringing with him a man whom he introduced\n\nas his union representative.    While Torres had been scheduled to\n\nmeet with Holsum's Human Resources Director, he was told upon\n\narriving with his union representative that the director was\n\n\n                                -5-\n\funavailable       and   that    he     would    have   to   meet    with    a    junior\n\nsupervisor.    He also was told that he would not be allowed to bring\n\nthe union representative with him.                The meeting was short.           The\n\nsupervisor simply told Torres that he had been fired, and then\n\nsaid,    \"Well,    that's      all.\"     While    Torres    asked    for    a    letter\n\nexplaining the reasons for his discharge, Holsum personnel neither\n\nfurnished such a letter nor explained to Torres why he had been\n\nfired.\n\n            A few days after Torres was fired, a Holsum supervisor\n\nconfronted Santiago as he was loading his truck.                    The supervisor\n\nasked Santiago if he knew that Torres had been fired.                             When\n\nSantiago nodded, the supervisor said that Santiago should \"be\n\ncareful\" and \"take care of his job\" because \"he was going to be\n\nnext.\"    A few days after this conversation, Calderón sent another\n\nanti-union letter to Holsum's employees.                This letter stated that\n\nthe company had learned \"in the past several days\" that \"a union\n\ncontinued    to    threaten     the     future   and   security     of     the   Holsum\n\nfamilies.\"    Again, the company interrogated its employees about\n\ntheir reactions to the letter.\n\n            Later that month, Holsum fired Santiago.                       Before the\n\nBoard, Holsum argued that it had terminated Santiago for his\n\nunauthorized distribution of six cups of hot coffee to a group of\n\nnon-employees, including Torres, who were soliciting for the union\n\noutside the plant.          The Board concluded that \"the real reason\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fSantiago was discharged was that . . . he gave [] coffee to persons\n\nwho were distributing 'union propaganda against the Company.'\"\n\n                                     II.\n\n            Under the National Labor Relations Act, it is illegal to\n\nfire an employee \"to encourage or discourage membership in any\n\nlabor organization.\"       29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(3).              When the NLRB's\n\nGeneral   Counsel   brings     regulatory     enforcement      proceedings   to\n\ncontest an employee's termination for union activity, the General\n\nCounsel bears the initial burden of showing \"that the employee's\n\nprotected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor\" for the\n\nemployee's discharge. NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., 462\n\nU.S. 393, 401 (1983) abrogated in part and clarified by Director,\n\nOffice of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Maher Terminals, Inc.,\n\n512 U.S. 267, 276-78 (1994).         The General Counsel satisfies this\n\nburden by showing: (1) that the employee engaged in protected\n\nactivity;   (2)   that   the    employer    was   aware   of    the   employee's\n\nprotected activity; (3)        that the employer had animus against such\n\nactivity; and (4) a causal connection between the employer's animus\n\nand the employee's termination.            See id. at 401-03; E.C. Waste,\n\nInc. v. NLRB, 359 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir. 2004).            The General Counsel\n\ndoes not have to show that the employee's protected union activity\n\n\"was the sole factor\" for the discharge.              NLRB v. Hospital San\n\nPablo, Inc., 207 F.3d 67, 70 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f            If the General Counsel meets this burden -- and by so\n\ndoing establishes a \"prima facie case\" that the employee was fired\n\nillegally -- the employer can defeat liability only by proving that\n\n\"it would     have taken the same action in the absence of the\n\nprotected activity.\"        E.C. Waste, 359 F.3d at 42.               But the Board\n\n\"does not have to accept\" even \"a seemingly plausible explanation\"\n\nfrom the employer.     Id.        \"If the Board supportably finds that the\n\nreasons   advanced    by    the     employer     are     either   insufficient     or\n\npretextual, the violation is deemed proven.\"                   Id.    The employer\n\nthen has limited recourse in this court.                  We are bound by all of\n\nthe   Board's    factual    findings       \"as   long    as   those   findings    are\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.\"                Id.    And we are especially\n\nreluctant   to    question    any     credibility        judgments    made   in   the\n\nregulatory setting.        Id.2\n\n            Despite the Board's findings, Holsum continues to argue\n\nthat its termination of Torres was permissible. Holsum alleges two\n\nerrors by the Board.          The company contends that there was no\n\nsubstantial      evidence    that     it    knew    about     Torres's    protected\n\nactivity, and that it would have fired Torres for allowing a\n\n\n2\n  In proceedings like this one, the administrative law judge, the\nperson who hears testimony and sees the witnesses, makes the\ncredibility judgments. See 29 C.F.R. §§ 102.34-102.35. A party\nthat disagrees with the judge's findings may file \"exceptions.\"\nSee 29 C.F.R. § 102.46.    The Board then determines whether the\nexcepted-to findings should be modified or adopted.      The Board\nnormally accomplishes such a review on the paper record, but it has\nthe power to reopen the record and to hold hearings. See 29 C.F.R.\n§§ 102.48-102.50.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fstranger to ride in his truck even if Torres had not engaged in any\n\nprotected activity.\n\nA.    Holsum's Knowledge of Torres's Union Activity\n\n            We   are    unconvinced     by    Holsum's    contention    that\n\nsubstantial evidence did not establish the company's awareness of\n\nTorres's efforts on behalf of the union.          The company criticizes\n\nthe    administrative    law   judge    for   inferring    that   a    Hoslum\n\nsupervisor, who on one occasion observed Torres standing in the\n\ncompany parking lot for about fifteen minutes, had personally\n\nobserved Torres's efforts to recruit other employees for the union.\n\nAs Holsum points out, there is no evidence that Torres actually\n\nencouraged any other employees to join the union during these\n\nminutes.    Still, as the Board found, there would have been many\n\nother occasions when Holsum personnel could have observed Torres's\n\nrecruitment efforts.       In the administrative law judge's words,\n\nTorres \"conducted his union activities, including his solicitation\n\nand distribution of union cards to other employees, out in the open\n\nin [Holsum]'s parking lot, in plain view of those entering or\n\nleaving [Holsum]'s facility. His activities, therefore, could very\n\nwell have been observed by any number of supervisors and managers\n\n. . ..\"     In short, Torres was a visible and vocal leader in a\n\nunionization effort that the company was monitoring and stridently\n\nopposing.\n\n            We have allowed the Board to infer knowledge of protected\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\factivity from no more than this.      In Hosp. San Pablo, the Board\n\nfound that an employer had knowledge of the union affiliation of an\n\nemployee who had:\n\n          started distributing cards to other employees\n          in the Hospital's stairways, bathrooms, empty\n          rooms, and machine rooms, but not in plain\n          sight of the supervisors[,] gave out cards at\n          the entrance to the Hospital at the start of\n          work and in the parking lot at lunch, and []\n          met with employees to discuss the union, both\n          at the Hospital and away. Some meetings were\n          held near the cafeteria, close to the Hospital\n          administration office . . ..\n\n\n207 F.3d at 71.     We said that the Board could find that the\n\nemployer had knowledge of the employee's protected activity, even\n\nthough there was no direct evidence that supervisors actually\n\nobserved the activity.   We noted:\n\n\n\n          At a minimum, [the terminated employee] was a\n          committed   union   activist    and   actually\n          solicited co-workers at the Hospital, and it\n          is reasonable to believe that someone dropped\n          a hint, if not more, to management.      Human\n          nature is not to the contrary. Cf. NLRB v.\n          Magnesium Casting Co., 668 F.2d 13, 16 (1st\n          Cir. 1981). Direct evidence of an employer's\n          knowledge of an employee's union activity is\n          not needed; inferences may be used to\n          establish the knowledge. See [NLRB v.] South\n          Shore Hosp. 571 F.2d [677,] 683 [(1st Cir.\n          1977)] (“It is now well established that such\n          knowledge need not be based on direct personal\n          observation, but can be inferred from the\n          facts and circumstances involved.”).\n\n\nId. at 74.   Here, it is equally clear that the Board could infer\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fHolsum's knowledge of Torres's protected activity from the facts in\n\nthe record.\n\nB.   Pretext\n\n            We are also unswayed by Holsum's contention that there\n\nwas insufficient evidence to find that its stated reason for firing\n\nTorres was pretext. Holsum's argument relies on its assertion that\n\nthe company had a \"one strike and you're out\" policy for violations\n\nof its \"no-helper\" rule, and that Torres would have been fired\n\npursuant to this rule even if he had not been involved with the\n\nunion.     The Board simply did not believe either half of this\n\nargument, which was presented through the testimony of Holsum\n\nsupervisors.    Rather, the Board adopted the administrative law\n\njudge's conclusion that \"no credible evidence was presented by\n\n[Holsum] to show that it ever had a 'one strike, you're out' rule\"\n\nfor \"violations of the no-helper policy,\" and that if Torres had\n\nnot been a union sympathizer he \"at most, would only have received\n\neither a warning or a suspension\" for the incident with the\n\nunwanted    passenger.      We   describe   briefly     why   the   Board's\n\nconclusions have sufficient support in the record.\n\n            First, there were reasons for the Board to disbelieve\n\ntestimony that there was a \"one strike\" policy for unauthorized\n\ntransport of passengers.      In attacking this credibility judgment,\n\nHolsum   focuses   on    evidence   suggesting   that   the   company   had\n\nterminated other employees for violating the no-helper rule.            But\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fthere was no evidence that the previously-terminated employees were\n\nsimilarly situated to Torres -- for example that they had committed\n\nonly a single violation of the policy.       On the other hand, there\n\nwas a documented case in which a Holsum salesman had driven around\n\nall day in his company truck with his cousin as an unauthorized\n\npassenger, but that employee was not fired.             There was also\n\nevidence that the company had informed supervisors and employees\n\nthat a warning could be given for violations of the no-helper\n\npolicy.\n\n           Second, there was also evidentiary support for the\n\nBoard's expressed doubts that Torres's brief, unwanted transport of\n\nhis uninvited passenger would have been grounds for termination if\n\nTorres had not been a union leader.     There was no evidence that any\n\npreviously-terminated   employee   had    been     guilty   of   such   an\n\ninsubstantial   violation   of   the    policy    against   unauthorized\n\npassengers. And there was no showing that the no-helper policy was\n\nso inflexible as to force an employee to stop his truck in the\n\nmiddle of an intersection and physically accost an intruder.\n\n           Third, there was additional evidence from which the\n\nBoard permissibly could infer that the company's true motivation\n\nfor firing Torres was his union activity.        The company capitalized\n\non Torres's termination as an opportunity to intimate to Santiago\n\nthat Torres had been fired as retaliation for his union leadership.\n\nThe company also intensified its anti-union activities in the days\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fafter Torres's firing, plausibly indicating that the effort to oust\n\nTorres was part of a concerted push to end the unionization drive.\n\nFinally, the company terminated Santiago only weeks after Torres's\n\ndischarge, plausibly indicating that the company had decided in the\n\nspring of 2003 to rid its workforce of union enthusiasts.    Given\n\nall of this evidence, we cannot say that there was insufficient\n\nsupport for the Board's conclusions that Holsum's stated reason for\n\nfiring Torres was pretextual, and that Torres's protected conduct\n\nwas a substantial or motivating factor in his discharge.\n\n                               III.\n\n          Holsum's petition for review is denied.      The Board's\n\ncross-petition for enforcement is granted.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f",

Most of these facts are not disputed here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Holsum is a commercial bakery, selling bread and other products to retailers in Puerto Rico. Torres and Jos&#233; Santiago were salesmen for Holsum. Their duties included driving company trucks and delivering baked goods to clients. In the summer of 2002, Torres, Santiago, and some other Holsum salespeople began to talk about forming a union. From the beginning, Santiago took the lead in scheduling meetings, and Torres led the drive to recruit other salespeople to join the union. Initially, Torres recruited other employees informally. By the fall of 2002, however, Torres had begun handing out union authorization cards and telling his coworkers that \"the union could better represent their interests.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Holsum had a \"union avoidance policy,\" and its management quickly began observing and discouraging the salespeople's unionization campaign. Private investigators working for the company observed one of the early organizational meetings. Then, in September 2002, Holsum's president, Ram&#243;n Calder&#243;n, sent a letter to his employees stating that a group of dissatisfied employees had \"attacked\" the company, creating \"a serious threat to your job, your future and the future of your family.\" The letter &#8212; which the Board did not find was improper in and of itself but which surely shows the company's feelings about the unionization effort &#8212; concluded by instructing employees to read and abide by the company's \"union avoidance policy,\" and to say \"`NO' to the union agitators.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after this letter was sent, Holsum supervisors confronted Torres, Santiago, and several other employees to ask them what they thought about the letter. These inquiries, in combination with other facts, led the Board to conclude that the company had illegally interrogated its workers. When Torres was interrogated about the letter, the conversation quickly became antagonistic. Torres refused to tell his supervisor what he thought of the letter, the supervisor persisted in his questioning, and ultimately Torres told the supervisor that he could not answer without \"compromis[ing] himself.\" The acrimonious interrogation did not stop Torres's efforts on behalf of the nascent union. Until his discharge in the spring of 2003, Torres spent \"almost every afternoon\" in the company parking lot, soliciting his fellow employees to sign union authorization cards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 2003, Torres was fired. Holsum maintains that it terminated Torres because he violated the company's rule against letting non-employees ride in company trucks. Crediting Torres's uncontradicted account, the Board found that one day in late April a man jumped into Torres's truck while Torres was waiting for a traffic light to change. Torres told the stranger to get out of the truck. The passenger refused to leave and demanded a ride to the next traffic light (in the direction Torres was traveling). Torres insisted that the person leave the truck and told him that he was prohibited by company policy from transporting passengers. Still, the passenger would not get out, and Torres would not have been able to remove him without resorting to physical force. The light changed, and cars behind the truck started honking. Torres decided that it would be better to transport his unwanted passenger a short distance than to have a physical fight with him in the middle of an intersection. The passenger jumped out of the truck when he reached his intended destination, and Torres continued on his route.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A Holsum supervisor observed the unwanted passenger's brief ride on Torres's truck. When Torres returned to Holsum's warehouse, another supervisor told him that he had been seen with an unauthorized passenger. The supervisor asked Torres to fill out a written report describing the incident. Torres did as he was asked. When Torres arrived at work the next day, two supervisors confronted him and told him that he was suspended without wages or health benefits. The supervisors also instructed Torres to return to the plant the following week for a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next week, Torres arrived at the plant at the time he had been told to come, bringing with him a man whom he introduced as his union representative. While Torres had been scheduled to meet with Holsum's Human Resources Director, he was told upon arriving with his union representative that the director was unavailable and that he would have to meet with a junior supervisor. He also was told that he would not be allowed to bring the union representative with him. The meeting was short. The supervisor simply told Torres that he had been fired, and then said, \"Well, that's all.\" While Torres asked for a letter explaining the reasons for his discharge, Holsum personnel neither furnished such a letter nor explained to Torres why he had been fired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days after Torres was fired, a Holsum supervisor confronted Santiago as he was loading his truck. The supervisor asked Santiago if he knew that Torres had been fired. When Santiago nodded, the supervisor said that Santiago should \"be careful\" and \"take care of his job\" because \"he was going to be next.\" A few days after this conversation, Calder&#243;n sent another anti-union letter to Holsum's employees. This letter stated that the company had learned \"in the past several days\" that \"a union continued to threaten the future and security of the Holsum families.\" Again, the company interrogated its employees about their reactions to the letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that month, Holsum fired Santiago. Before the Board, Holsum argued that it had terminated Santiago for his unauthorized distribution of six cups of hot coffee to a group of non-employees, including Torres, who were soliciting for the union outside the plant. The Board concluded that \"the real reason Santiago was discharged was that . . . he gave [] coffee to persons who were distributing `union propaganda against the Company.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the National Labor Relations Act, it is illegal to fire an employee \"to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 158(a)(3). When the NLRB's General Counsel brings regulatory enforcement proceedings to contest an employee's termination for union activity, the General Counsel bears the initial burden of showing \"that the employee's protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor\" for the employee's discharge. <i>NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp.,</i> 462 U.S. 393, 401, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983) <i>abrogated in part and clarified by Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Maher Terminals, Inc.,</i> 512 U.S. 267, 276-78, 114 S.Ct. 2251, 129 L.Ed.2d 221 (1994). The General Counsel satisfies this burden by showing: (1) that the employee engaged in protected activity; (2) that the employer was aware of the employee's protected activity; (3) that the employer had animus against such activity; and (4) a causal connection between the employer's animus and the employee's termination. <i>See id.</i> at 401-03, 103 S.Ct. 2469; <i>E.C. Waste, Inc. v. NLRB,</i> 359 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir.2004). The General Counsel does not have to show that the employee's protected union activity \"was the sole factor\" for the discharge. <i>NLRB v. Hospital San Pablo, Inc.,</i> 207 F.3d 67, 70 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the General Counsel meets this burden &#8212; and by so doing establishes a \"prima facie case\" that the employee was fired illegally &#8212; the employer can defeat liability only by proving that \"it would have taken the same action in the absence of the protected activity.\" <i>E.C. Waste,</i> 359 F.3d at 42. But the Board \"does not have to accept\" even \"a seemingly plausible explanation\" from the employer. <i>Id.</i> \"If the Board supportably finds that the reasons advanced by the employer are either insufficient or pretextual, the violation is deemed proven.\" <i>Id.</i> The employer then has limited recourse in this court. We are bound by all of the Board's factual findings \"as long as those findings are supported by substantial evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> And we are especially reluctant to question any credibility judgments made in the regulatory setting. <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the Board's findings, Holsum continues to argue that its termination of Torres was permissible. Holsum alleges two errors by the Board. The company contends that there was no substantial evidence that it knew about Torres's protected activity, and that it would have fired Torres for allowing a stranger to ride in his truck even if Torres had not engaged in any protected activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Holsum's Knowledge of Torres's Union Activity</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are unconvinced by Holsum's contention that substantial evidence did not establish the company's awareness of Torres's efforts on behalf of the union. The company criticizes the administrative law judge for inferring that a Holsum supervisor, who on one occasion observed Torres standing in the company parking lot for about fifteen minutes, had personally observed Torres's efforts to recruit other employees for the union. As Holsum points out, there is no evidence that Torres actually encouraged any other employees to join the union during these minutes. Still, as the Board found, there would have been many other occasions when Holsum personnel could have observed Torres's recruitment efforts. In the administrative law judge's words, Torres \"conducted his union activities, including his solicitation and distribution of union cards to other employees, out in the open in [Holsum]'s parking lot, in plain view of those entering or leaving [Holsum]'s facility. His activities, therefore, could very well have been observed by any number of supervisors and managers. . . .\" In short, Torres was a visible and vocal leader in a unionization effort that the company was monitoring and stridently opposing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have allowed the Board to infer knowledge of protected activity from no more than this. In <i>Hosp. San Pablo,</i> the Board found that an employer had knowledge of the union affiliation of an employee who had:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">started distributing cards to other employees in the Hospital's stairways, bathrooms, empty rooms, and machine rooms, but not in plain sight of the supervisors[,] gave out cards at the entrance to the Hospital at the start of work and in the parking lot at lunch, and [ ] met with employees to discuss the union, both at the Hospital and away. Some meetings were held near the cafeteria, close to the Hospital administration office. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">207 F.3d at 71. We said that the Board could find that the employer had knowledge of the employee's protected activity, even though there was no direct evidence that supervisors actually observed the activity. We noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a minimum, [the terminated employee] was a committed union activist and actually solicited co-workers at the Hospital, and it is reasonable to believe that someone dropped a hint, if not more, to management. Human nature is not to the contrary. <i>Cf. NLRB v. Magnesium Casting Co.,</i> 668 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1981). Direct evidence of an employer's knowledge of an employee's union activity is not needed; inferences may be used to establish the knowledge. <i>See</i> [<i>NLRB</i> v.] <i>South Shore Hosp.</i> 571 F.2d [677,] 683 [(1st Cir.1977)] (\"It is now well established that such knowledge need not be based on direct personal observation, but can be inferred from the facts and circumstances involved.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 74. Here, it is equally clear that the Board could infer Holsum's knowledge of Torres's protected activity from the facts in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Pretext</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are also unswayed by Holsum's contention that there was insufficient evidence to find that its stated reason for firing Torres was pretext. Holsum's argument relies on its assertion that the company had a \"one strike and you're out\" policy for violations of its \"no-helper\" rule, and that Torres would have been fired pursuant to this rule even if he had not been involved with the union. The Board simply did not believe either half of this argument, which was presented through the testimony of Holsum supervisors. Rather, the Board adopted the administrative law judge's conclusion that \"no credible evidence was presented by [Holsum] to show that it ever had a `one strike, you're out' rule\" for \"violations of the no-helper policy,\" and that if Torres had not been a union sympathizer he \"at most, would only have received either a warning or a suspension\" for the incident with the unwanted passenger. We describe briefly why the Board's conclusions have sufficient support in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, there were reasons for the Board to disbelieve testimony that there was a \"one strike\" policy for unauthorized transport of passengers. In attacking this credibility judgment, Holsum focuses on evidence suggesting that the company had terminated other employees for violating the no-helper rule. But there was no evidence that the previously-terminated employees were similarly situated to Torres &#8212; for example that they had committed only a single violation of the policy. On the other hand, there was a documented case in which a Holsum salesman had driven around all day in his company truck with his cousin as an unauthorized passenger, but that employee was <i>not</i> fired. There was also evidence that the company had informed supervisors and employees that a warning could be given for violations of the no-helper policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there was also evidentiary support for the Board's expressed doubts that Torres's brief, unwanted transport of his uninvited passenger would have been grounds for termination if Torres had not been a union leader. There was no evidence that any previously-terminated employee had been guilty of such an insubstantial violation of the policy against unauthorized passengers. And there was no showing that the no-helper policy was so inflexible as to force an employee to stop his truck in the middle of an intersection and physically accost an intruder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, there was additional evidence from which the Board permissibly could infer that the company's true motivation for firing Torres was his union activity. The company capitalized on Torres's termination as an opportunity to intimate to Santiago that Torres had been fired as retaliation for his union leadership. The company also intensified its anti-union activities in the days after Torres's firing, plausibly indicating that the effort to oust Torres was part of a concerted push to end the unionization drive. Finally, the company terminated Santiago only weeks after Torres's discharge, plausibly indicating that the company had decided in the spring of 2003 to rid its workforce of union enthusiasts. Given all of this evidence, we cannot say that there was insufficient support for the Board's conclusions that Holsum's stated reason for firing Torres was pretextual, and that Torres's protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in his discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Holsum's petition for review is denied. The Board's cross-petition for enforcement is granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> While Holsum only contests the Board's order as it relates to Torres, the company does argue that the evidence before the Board was insufficient to support a finding of anti-union animus. Holsum also makes a cursory argument that there was no causal connection between any such animus and Torres's termination. These undeveloped arguments, which are plainly belied by the evidence, are too insubstantial to warrant discussion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In proceedings like this one, the administrative law judge, the person who hears testimony and sees the witnesses, makes the credibility judgments<i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 102.34-102.35.

When Santiago nodded, the supervisor said that Santiago should \"be careful\" and \"take care of his job\" because \"he was going to be next.\" A few days after this conversation, Calder&#243;n sent another anti-union letter to Holsum's employees. This letter stated that the company had learned \"in the past several days\" that \"a union continued to threaten the future and security of the Holsum families.\" Again, the company interrogated its employees about their reactions to the letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that month, Holsum fired Santiago. Before the Board, Holsum argued that it had terminated Santiago for his unauthorized distribution of six cups of hot coffee to a group of non-employees, including Torres, who were soliciting for the union outside the plant. The Board concluded that \"the real reason Santiago was discharged was that . . . he gave [] coffee to persons who were distributing `union propaganda against the Company.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the National Labor Relations Act, it is illegal to fire an employee \"to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 158(a)(3). When the NLRB's General Counsel brings regulatory enforcement proceedings to contest an employee's termination for union activity, the General Counsel bears the initial burden of showing \"that the employee's protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor\" for the employee's discharge. <i>NLRB v.

But the Board \"does not have to accept\" even \"a seemingly plausible explanation\" from the employer. <i>Id.</i> \"If the Board supportably finds that the reasons advanced by the employer are either insufficient or pretextual, the violation is deemed proven.\" <i>Id.</i> The employer then has limited recourse in this court.

Holsum alleges two errors by the Board. The company contends that there was no substantial evidence that it knew about Torres's protected activity, and that it would have fired Torres for allowing a stranger to ride in his truck even if Torres had not engaged in any protected activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

The company criticizes the administrative law judge for inferring that a Holsum supervisor, who on one occasion observed Torres standing in the company parking lot for about fifteen minutes, had personally observed Torres's efforts to recruit other employees for the union. As Holsum points out, there is no evidence that Torres actually encouraged any other employees to join the union during these minutes. Still, as the Board found, there would have been many other occasions when Holsum personnel could have observed Torres's recruitment efforts. In the administrative law judge's words, Torres \"conducted his union activities, including his solicitation and distribution of union cards to other employees, out in the open in [Holsum]'s parking lot, in plain view of those entering or leaving [Holsum]'s facility. His activities, therefore, could very well have been observed by any number of supervisors and managers. . . .\" In short, Torres was a visible and vocal leader in a unionization effort that the company was monitoring and stridently opposing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have allowed the Board to infer knowledge of protected activity from no more than this. In <i>Hosp. San Pablo,</i> the Board found that an employer had knowledge of the union affiliation of an employee who had:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">started distributing cards to other employees in the Hospital's stairways, bathrooms, empty rooms, and machine rooms, but not in plain sight of the supervisors[,] gave out cards at the entrance to the Hospital at the start of work and in the parking lot at lunch, and [ ] met with employees to discuss the union, both at the Hospital and away. Some meetings were held near the cafeteria, close to the Hospital administration office. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">207 F.3d at 71. We said that the Board could find that the employer had knowledge of the employee's protected activity, even though there was no direct evidence that supervisors actually observed the activity. We noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a minimum, [the terminated employee] was a committed union activist and actually solicited co-workers at the Hospital, and it is reasonable to believe that someone dropped a hint, if not more, to management. Human nature is not to the contrary. <i>Cf. NLRB v. Magnesium Casting Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 1981). Direct evidence of an employer's knowledge of an employee's union activity is not needed; inferences may be used to establish the knowledge. <i>See</i> [<i>NLRB</i> v.] <i>South Shore Hosp.</i> 571 F.2d [677,] 683 [(1st Cir.1977)] (\"It is now well established that such knowledge need not be based on direct personal observation, but can be inferred from the facts and circumstances involved.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 74. Here, it is equally clear that the Board could infer Holsum's knowledge of Torres's protected activity from the facts in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Pretext</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are also unswayed by Holsum's contention that there was insufficient evidence to find that its stated reason for firing Torres was pretext. Holsum's argument relies on its assertion that the company had a \"one strike and you're out\" policy for violations of its \"no-helper\" rule, and that Torres would have been fired pursuant to this rule even if he had not been involved with the union. The Board simply did not believe either half of this argument, which was presented through the testimony of Holsum supervisors. Rather, the Board adopted the administrative law judge's conclusion that \"no credible evidence was presented by [Holsum] to show that it ever had a `one strike, you're out' rule\" for \"violations of the no-helper policy,\" and that if Torres had not been a union sympathizer he \"at most, would only have received either a warning or a suspension\" for the incident with the unwanted passenger. We describe briefly why the Board's conclusions have sufficient support in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, there were reasons for the Board to disbelieve testimony that there was a \"one strike\" policy for unauthorized transport of passengers. In attacking this credibility judgment, Holsum focuses on evidence suggesting that the company had terminated other employees for violating the no-helper rule. But there was no evidence that the previously-terminated employees were similarly situated to Torres &#8212; for example that they had committed only a single violation of the policy. On the other hand, there was a documented case in which a Holsum salesman had driven around all day in his company truck with his cousin as an unauthorized passenger, but that employee was <i>not</i> fired. There was also evidence that the company had informed supervisors and employees that a warning could be given for violations of the no-helper policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there was also evidentiary support for the Board's expressed doubts that Torres's brief, unwanted transport of his uninvited passenger would have been grounds for termination if Torres had not been a union leader. There was no evidence that any previously-terminated employee had been guilty of such an insubstantial violation of the policy against unauthorized passengers. And there was no showing that the no-helper policy was so inflexible as to force an employee to stop his truck in the middle of an intersection and physically accost an intruder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, there was additional evidence from which the Board permissibly could infer that the company's true motivation for firing Torres was his union activity. The company capitalized on Torres's termination as an opportunity to intimate to Santiago that Torres had been fired as retaliation for his union leadership. The company also intensified its anti-union activities in the days after Torres's firing, plausibly indicating that the effort to oust Torres was part of a concerted push to end the unionization drive. Finally, the company terminated Santiago only weeks after Torres's discharge, plausibly indicating that the company had decided in the spring of 2003 to rid its workforce of union enthusiasts. Given all of this evidence, we cannot say that there was insufficient support for the Board's conclusions that Holsum's stated reason for firing Torres was pretextual, and that Torres's protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in his discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Holsum's petition for review is denied. The Board's cross-petition for enforcement is granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> While Holsum only contests the Board's order as it relates to Torres, the company does argue that the evidence before the Board was insufficient to support a finding of anti-union animus. Holsum also makes a cursory argument that there was no causal connection between any such animus and Torres's termination. These undeveloped arguments, which are plainly belied by the evidence, are too insubstantial to warrant discussion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In proceedings like this one, the administrative law judge, the person who hears testimony and sees the witnesses, makes the credibility judgments<i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 102.34-102.35.
