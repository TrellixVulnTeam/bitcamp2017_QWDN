HOUSE,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n              [Hon. Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                    Torruella, Lipez, and Howard,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Peter N. Wang, with whom Yonaton Aronoff and Foley & Lardner\nLLP, was on brief for appellant.\n     Kenneth J. DeMoura, with whom Michael D. Riseberg, Colleen M.\nNevin, and Adler Pollock & Sheehan P.C., was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          September 8, 2008\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.              Gregory J. House, a former\n\nemployee of First Marblehead Corporation, was unable to exercise\n\nhis incentive stock options because he failed to do so within three\n\nmonths of his resignation.           In a set of claims removed to federal\n\ndistrict court under diversity jurisdiction, House alleged, inter\n\nalia,   that      he   had   relied    on     First   Marblehead's     negligent\n\nmisrepresentations that the options would be viable for ten years.\n\nA jury found that House had reasonably relied on those negligent\n\nrepresentations.       However, the jury concluded that House would not\n\nhave exercised those options during the three months after his\n\nresignation and thus awarded no damages.                   House now appeals,\n\nchallenging the admission of certain expert testimony and the\n\ndistrict court's denial of his motion for a new trial.                    After\n\ncareful review, we conclude there was no error and affirm the\n\njury's verdict.\n\n                                I.    Background\n\n            The    background    facts        in   this   case   are   generally\n\nundisputed.    In 1996, House was recruited by his friend and First\n\nMarblehead Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), Daniel Meyers, to work\n\nat First Marblehead, a start-up student loan servicing company.\n\nHouse was offered a position as President of First Marblehead Data\n\nServices.   House accepted the job and as part of his employment, he\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fwas granted incentive stock options to purchase 2,500 shares at a\n\nstrike price of $32 per share.1\n\n          First   Marblehead's      stock   option    plan   (\"the   Plan\")\n\nprovided that the options would have a duration of ten years.\n\nUnbeknownst to House, the Plan also had a provision that in the\n\nevent of an employee's departure from the company, the options\n\nwould expire within three months of the date of resignation. House\n\nattested, and First Marblehead does not seriously challenge, that\n\nhe did not receive a copy of either the Plan or the written\n\ndocument memorializing the grant of the options.               Furthermore,\n\ncommunications    between   House     and   various    First    Marblehead\n\nexecutives -- CEO Myers, Executive Vice President Ralph James, and\n\noutside general counsel, Rod Hoffman -- reiterated that the options\n\nwould be good for ten years and made no mention of the three-month\n\nexpiration provision in the event of resignation.2\n\n\n1\n   Stock options give the holder the ability to purchase a company\nstock at a set price. It would have cost $80,000 to exercise all\n2,500 options.\n2\n   Indeed, Hoffman testified that at some point, he realized that\nhe had omitted the three-month expiration provision from the Plan.\nHe authored a \"Corrections and Amplifications\" memo, which clearly\nstated that in the event of a resignation, the options must be\nexercised within three months:\n\n     I found that I had misstated one of the terms of the\n     option in the summary memo . . . . Mea culpa. A copy of\n     that revised memo is attached . . . . You will note that\n     the change is to Section II.4 which describes what\n     happens to the options upon termination of employment.\n\nAlthough Hoffman testified that he delivered this revised memo to\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            In February 1998, House resigned from First Marblehead;\n\nno one at the company mentioned the three-month period within which\n\nhe would have to exercise his options.               In 2001, First Marblehead\n\nacquired the assets of a nonprofit student loan company, TERI. The\n\nacquisition allowed First Marblehead to increase its loan volume\n\nsignificantly. Due in part to the success of the TERI acquisition,\n\nFirst Marblehead became a publicly traded company in 2003, which\n\nresulted in a dramatic increase in the value of the company's\n\nstock.   Several months later, after hearing about the company's\n\nsuccessful initial public offering, House contacted Meyers and\n\ninquired about exercising his options.                   House was then informed\n\nthat the options had expired in May 1998, three months after his\n\nresignation.\n\n            House     and     First    Marblehead          initially         attempted\n\nnegotiation; First Marblehead averred that the options had expired\n\nand House asserted that his options were worth $7 million.                     At some\n\npoint,   First      Marblehead    sought         a   declaratory        judgment     in\n\nMassachusetts Superior Court that the options had expired three\n\nmonths   after      his   resignation.          On   the       basis    of   diversity\n\njurisdiction,     House     removed   the       action    to    federal      court   and\n\nasserted two counterclaims:           breach of contract and promissory\n\nestoppel.        House    then   added      a    third     claim       for   negligent\n\n\n\nthe company, the parties generally agree that House never received\nit.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fmisrepresentation.            On   First   Marblehead's   motion   for    summary\n\njudgment, the district court dismissed the case entirely.                       On\n\nappeal, we upheld summary judgment on the breach of contract and\n\npromissory estoppel claims, but vacated and remanded for further\n\nproceedings        on   the   negligent    misrepresentation   claim.       First\n\nMarblehead Corp. v. House, 473 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n              As the case proceeded to trial, First Marblehead made it\n\nknown that it intended to call Robert Sherwin as an expert witness\n\nand submitted his expert report.                 House objected to Sherwin's\n\nreport and anticipated testimony, arguing that it was irrelevant\n\nand that Sherwin was not a qualified expert.               The district court\n\ndeclined to rule and reserved the issue for trial.\n\n              At trial, House testified that had he known of the three-\n\nmonth expiration, he would have exercised his options during that\n\nperiod: \"There's zero chance . . . in the God's green earth that I\n\nwas going to let [the options] lapse into worthlessness.                    That\n\nwould not have happened.\"           He claimed, without equivocation, that\n\nhe would have paid the $80,000 necessary at the time to exercise\n\nall 2,500 of his options. He maintained that the company's success\n\nwas \"nearly guaranteed.\" According to House's calculations, had he\n\nexercised his options within the three-month period, the 2,500\n\nshares would have eventually amounted to 150,000 shares of common\n\nstock   (as    a    result    of   subsequent    stock   splits)   and,   had   he\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fcontinued to keep his shares through the company's public offering,\n\nthe value of his stock would have been worth $8.4 million.\n\n           First Marblehead argued, contrary to House's testimony,\n\nthat the company's success was not such a foregone conclusion.                 As\n\nof House's resignation in 1998, the company had lost money during\n\neach of the first seven years since its inception; the market value\n\nof the stock had dropped from $32 per share in 1997 to $20 per\n\nshare in 1998.     Meyers and James both testified that the company\n\nstruggled to obtain necessary financing and it was in a precarious\n\nfinancial situation until the successful acquisition of TERI in\n\n2001 and the company's initial public offering of stock.                    First\n\nMarblehead submitted a 2005 e-mail from House to his brother in\n\nwhich he wrote that in 1998, shortly before leaving the company, he\n\nhad attempted to sell his options back to the company at a\n\nsubstantial discount; House stated that \"the options were not worth\n\na great deal.\"     In the e-mail, House went on to say: \"Seven years\n\nlater, in October of 2003, the company, lo and behold and to my\n\ngreat surprise, went public.\"\n\n           At    issue   in   this   appeal   is    the   testimony    of   First\n\nMarblehead's expert witness, Robert Sherwin, who testified over\n\nHouse's objection.       Sherwin is a certified public accountant, with\n\na   bachelor's   degree    in    economics    and   a   law   degree   from   the\n\nUniversity of Chicago.          At the time of trial, he was employed by\n\nAnalysis Group, a consulting company that specializes in economics,\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\ffinance, and strategy consulting.            He concentrates in two areas of\n\neconomics:       financial economics and industrial organization.\n\n            Sherwin testified that during the three-month period in\n\nwhich House would have had to exercise his stock options (had he\n\nknown of their expiration), the \"stock was not worth $80,000, or\n\nworth at best $80,000.\"          He further testified that in his opinion,\n\nit would not have made financial sense for House to exercise the\n\noptions at that time for several reasons.            First, House would not\n\nhave obtained an immediate financial gain because the stock was not\n\nworth more than the $80,000 House would have had to pay to obtain\n\nthem. Second, First Marblehead was, at the time, a private company\n\nand it would have been more difficult to sell those private shares\n\nthan    shares    in   a   publicly    traded   company.        Third,   such   a\n\nsignificant investment in one stock would be risky and contrary to\n\nthe principle of diversification.            Fourth, Sherwin testified that\n\nHouse's own financial position at the time made such an investment\n\neven riskier: \"House at the time was going through a divorce, had\n\nlimited assets in the bank, he had no stock that he owned . . .\n\n[$80,000 worth of stock] would           probably be more than a hundred\n\npercent of [his investable assets].\"\n\n            On July 23, 2007, the jury returned a verdict in which it\n\nfound    that     House    had    reasonably    relied     on   the   negligent\n\nmisrepresentations of First Marblehead regarding the expiration of\n\nhis incentive stock options. However, the jury concluded that even\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fif House had been aware of the three-month expiration period, he\n\nwould not have exercised the options; the jury thus awarded House\n\nno damages.   The district court denied House's motion for a new\n\ntrial.   House now appeals.\n\n                          II.   Discussion\n\n           We review the district court's decision regarding the\n\nadmissibility of expert testimony for abuse of discretion.     See\n\nWilder v. Eberhart, 977 F.2d 673, 676 (1st Cir. 1992) (citing Int'l\n\nAdhesive Coating Co., Inc. v. Bolton Emerson Int'l, 851 F.2d 540,\n\n544 (1st Cir. 1988)); see also Rodríguez v. Smithkline Beecham, 224\n\nF.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2000).    Our deference to the district court's\n\njudgment is consistent with the discretion given to the district\n\ncourt by the Federal Rules of Evidence, which \"afford district\n\ncourts substantial latitude in the admission or exclusion of\n\nopinion evidence.\"   Crowe v. Marchand, 506 F.3d 13, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n2007); see also Espeaignnette v. Gene Tierney Co. Inc., 43 F.3d 1,\n\n11 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"A trial judge's rulings in this sphere should\n\nbe upheld unless manifestly erroneous.\" (quoting United States v.\n\nSepúlveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1183 (1st Cir. 1993) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted))).    Moreover, even if an evidentiary ruling is\n\ndeemed erroneous, we will not disturb the jury's verdict if \"it is\n\nhighly probable that the error did not affect the outcome of the\n\ncase.\"   McDonough v. City of Quincy, 452 F.3d 8, 19-20 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f           Federal Rule of Evidence 702 requires that before giving\n\ntestimony as an expert, a witness must be \"qualified as an expert\n\nby   knowledge,    skill,   experience,     training,       or   education\"   and\n\nprovide such knowledge that \"will assist the trier of fact to\n\nunderstand   the     evidence   or   to    determine    a    fact   in   issue.\"\n\nFurthermore, the expert's testimony must be \"based upon sufficient\n\nfacts or data\" that result from the application of \"reliable\n\nprinciples and methods.\"        Fed. R. Evid. 702.      The purpose of these\n\nrequirements is to \"ensure, as a condition of admissibility, that\n\nproffered expert testimony rests on a sufficiently trustworthy\n\nfoundation.\"      Crowe, 506 F.3d at 17 (citing Daubert v. Merrell Dow\n\nPharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 597 (1993)).\n\n           House challenges Sherwin's qualifications to testify as\n\nan expert and also argues that the substance of his testimony was\n\nimproper. With respect to Sherwin's qualifications, House contends\n\nthat Sherwin's experience is limited to industrial organization and\n\nsecurities pricing, and he therefore lacks the expertise to testify\n\nabout how individuals choose investments and arrange portfolios.\n\nHouse argues that such testimony would have been appropriate from\n\na certified financial planner, which Sherwin is not.\n\n           First Marblehead rejects House's myopic view of Sherwin's\n\ncredentials.      Sherwin has nearly two decades of experience as a\n\nconsultant in economics, finance, and strategy consulting.                    With\n\nrespect to his testimony regarding investment diversification,\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fSherwin works on the 401(k) committee at his consulting firm and\n\nadvises employees in their various investments.   Additionally, he\n\ntestified that his experience includes providing investment advice\n\nto accredited investors.   While a certified financial planner who\n\nfocuses entirely on individual investment decisionmaking would also\n\nhave been qualified to provide this testimony, we are unconvinced\n\nthat Sherwin's own credentials are such that he is unqualified to\n\ntestify as an expert in this case.3   See United States v. Vargas,\n\n471 F.3d 255, 262 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"It is not required that experts\n\nbe 'blue-ribbon practitioners' with optimal qualifications\" (citing\n\nUnited States v. Mahone, 453 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir. 2006))).     We\n\nthus conclude that the district court's decision to find Sherwin\n\nqualified to testify as an expert falls well within the district\n\ncourt's   \"broad   discretionary   powers   in    determining   the\n\nqualification . . . of expert witnesses.\"   Diefenbach v. Sheridan\n\nTransp., 229 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting Richmond Steel\n\nInc. v. Puerto Rican Am. Ins. Co., 954 F.2d 19, 20 (1st Cir.\n\n1992)).\n\n\n\n\n3\n   House also argues that the district court should have provided\nhim with the opportunity to conduct a voir dire of Sherwin outside\nthe hearing of the jury. We are unmoved by this argument; our Rule\n702 inquiry does not demand that the district court follow any\nparticular procedure. See United States v. Díaz, 300 F.3d 66, 73-\n74 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing Daubert, 509 U.S. at 594; Kumho Tire Co.\nLtd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 152 (1999)). Moreover, in this\ncase, despite ample opportunity to do so, House made no request for\na voir dire until Sherwin began his testimony.\n\n                               -10-\n\f            Second, with respect to whether the testimony was helpful\n\nto the jury, House makes two somewhat inconsistent arguments for\n\nwhy   the   district   court   erred:    (1)   Sherwin's   testimony   was\n\nirrelevant because the jury is tasked with determining what House\n\n-- and not a reasonable investor -- would have done with the\n\noptions had he known about the three-month expiration period; and\n\n(2) by testifying as to what a reasonable investor would have done,\n\nSherwin's testimony improperly invaded the province of the jury.\n\n            With respect to the issue of relevance, \"expert testimony\n\nmust be relevant . . . in the incremental sense that the expert's\n\nproposed opinion, if admitted, likely would assist the trier of\n\nfact to understand or determine a fact in issue.\"          Ruiz-Troche v.\n\nPepsi Cola of P.R. Bottling Co., 161 F.3d 77, 81 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(citing Daubert, 509 U.S. at 591-92).           In this case, Sherwin's\n\ntestimony was proffered by First Marblehead to explain to the jury\n\nhow stock options function and how an investor would think about\n\nexercising those options.      Those are not topics ordinarily within\n\nthe knowledge of the jury and thus are appropriate for expert\n\ntestimony.    See United States v. Shay, 57 F.3d 126, 132-33 (1st\n\nCir. 1995) (\"The fundamental question that a court must answer in\n\ndetermining whether a proposed expert's testimony will assist the\n\ntrier of fact is 'whether the untrained layman would be qualified\n\nto determine intelligently and to the best degree, the particular\n\nissue   without   enlightenment   from    those   having   a   specialized\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\funderstanding of the subject matter involved.'\" (quoting United\n\nStates v. Montas, 41 F.3d 775, 783 (1st Cir. 1994)).\n\n          Sherwin    testified   that   based   on   House's   financial\n\ncircumstances in early 1998 and the uncertainty surrounding First\n\nMarblehead's financial future, it would not have made financial\n\nsense for someone in House's position to exercise the options.\n\nSherwin testified that:\n\n          the stock would have been worth no more than\n          the amount [House] would have had to have\n          paid, potentially less than that . . . . [and]\n          the stock would not be particularly suitable\n          for someone in Mr. House's position in terms\n          of the risk and the liquidity and the\n          diversification     areas     of    financial\n          performance.\n\nSherwin explained that an incentive stock option plan provides an\n\nemployee with the opportunity to purchase stock at a set strike\n\nprice and, potentially, realize an immediate financial gain if the\n\nvalue of the stock is higher than the purchase price.      In 1998 when\n\nHouse would have had to decide whether or not to exercise the\n\noptions, he would have had to pay $80,000 for stock that was worth\n\n-- at most, $80,000; House would not have enjoyed any immediate\n\nfinancial gains.    Sherwin further explained that based on House's\n\nfinancial position -- House's salary at the time was $70,000, he\n\nhad only $50,000 in personal assets, and he would have had to\n\nborrow around $30,000 in order to purchase the options -- such a\n\nlarge investment in one privately held company was risky.            The\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that Sherwin's testimony was relevant\n\n                                 -12-\n\fand provided helpful context for the jury was well within the\n\ncourt's broad discretion.\n\n            Testimony   that   provides      a   necessary   context   and\n\nframework, especially in cases involving complex or unfamiliar\n\nconcepts,    can   be   appropriate    for   expert   testimony   without\n\nimproperly interfering with the jury's assessment of credibility.\n\nCf. United States v. Brien, 59 F.3d 274, 276-77 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(observing that in the context of identification, expert testimony\n\ncould \"give the jury background information about the mechanism of\n\nmemory, types of errors, error rates, and other information not\n\ncommonly possessed by the jury\").        Our review of the record makes\n\nclear that Sherwin's testimony was careful to provide the jury with\n\nthe information to evaluate House's assertions as to what he would\n\nhave done in 1998, and stopped short of giving Sherwin's own\n\nopinion as to what he believed House would have done.         At no point\n\ndid Sherwin opine on the credibility of House's testimony; his\n\ncomments were limited to expressing an opinion on the financial\n\nrisk involved in the decision.    The determination of whether House\n\nwas credible or not was appropriately left to the jury.\n\n            We therefore conclude that the district court's decision\n\nto admit Sherwin's expert testimony was not an abuse of discretion.\n\nHouse also appeals the denial of his Rule 59 motion on the sole\n\nbasis that the admission of Sherwin's testimony was substantial\n\nerror and highly prejudicial.         Given our determination that the\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fdistrict court did not err in deeming Sherwin qualified and his\n\ntestimony relevant, the district court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin denying House's motion for a new trial.   See Crowe, 506 F.3d at\n\n19.\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ndecision to allow the expert testimony and affirm the district\n\ncourt's denial of the motion for a new trial.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f",

Gregory J. House, a former\n\nemployee of First Marblehead Corporation, was unable to exercise\n\nhis incentive stock options because he failed to do so within three\n\nmonths of his resignation.           In a set of claims removed to federal\n\ndistrict court under diversity jurisdiction, House alleged, inter\n\nalia,   that      he   had   relied    on     First   Marblehead's     negligent\n\nmisrepresentations that the options would be viable for ten years.\n\nA jury found that House had reasonably relied on those negligent\n\nrepresentations.       However, the jury concluded that House would not\n\nhave exercised those options during the three months after his\n\nresignation and thus awarded no damages.                   House now appeals,\n\nchallenging the admission of certain expert testimony and the\n\ndistrict court's denial of his motion for a new trial.                    After\n\ncareful review, we conclude there was no error and affirm the\n\njury's verdict.\n\n                                I.    Background\n\n            The    background    facts        in   this   case   are   generally\n\nundisputed.    In 1996, House was recruited by his friend and First\n\nMarblehead Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), Daniel Meyers, to work\n\nat First Marblehead, a start-up student loan servicing company.\n\nHouse was offered a position as President of First Marblehead Data\n\nServices.   House accepted the job and as part of his employment, he\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fwas granted incentive stock options to purchase 2,500 shares at a\n\nstrike price of $32 per share.1\n\n          First   Marblehead's      stock   option    plan   (\"the   Plan\")\n\nprovided that the options would have a duration of ten years.\n\nUnbeknownst to House, the Plan also had a provision that in the\n\nevent of an employee's departure from the company, the options\n\nwould expire within three months of the date of resignation. House\n\nattested, and First Marblehead does not seriously challenge, that\n\nhe did not receive a copy of either the Plan or the written\n\ndocument memorializing the grant of the options.               Furthermore,\n\ncommunications    between   House     and   various    First    Marblehead\n\nexecutives -- CEO Myers, Executive Vice President Ralph James, and\n\noutside general counsel, Rod Hoffman -- reiterated that the options\n\nwould be good for ten years and made no mention of the three-month\n\nexpiration provision in the event of resignation.2\n\n\n1\n   Stock options give the holder the ability to purchase a company\nstock at a set price. It would have cost $80,000 to exercise all\n2,500 options.\n2\n   Indeed, Hoffman testified that at some point, he realized that\nhe had omitted the three-month expiration provision from the Plan.\nHe authored a \"Corrections and Amplifications\" memo, which clearly\nstated that in the event of a resignation, the options must be\nexercised within three months:\n\n     I found that I had misstated one of the terms of the\n     option in the summary memo . . . . Mea culpa. A copy of\n     that revised memo is attached . . . . You will note that\n     the change is to Section II.4 which describes what\n     happens to the options upon termination of employment.\n\nAlthough Hoffman testified that he delivered this revised memo to\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            In February 1998, House resigned from First Marblehead;\n\nno one at the company mentioned the three-month period within which\n\nhe would have to exercise his options.               In 2001, First Marblehead\n\nacquired the assets of a nonprofit student loan company, TERI. The\n\nacquisition allowed First Marblehead to increase its loan volume\n\nsignificantly. Due in part to the success of the TERI acquisition,\n\nFirst Marblehead became a publicly traded company in 2003, which\n\nresulted in a dramatic increase in the value of the company's\n\nstock.   Several months later, after hearing about the company's\n\nsuccessful initial public offering, House contacted Meyers and\n\ninquired about exercising his options.                   House was then informed\n\nthat the options had expired in May 1998, three months after his\n\nresignation.\n\n            House     and     First    Marblehead          initially         attempted\n\nnegotiation; First Marblehead averred that the options had expired\n\nand House asserted that his options were worth $7 million.                     At some\n\npoint,   First      Marblehead    sought         a   declaratory        judgment     in\n\nMassachusetts Superior Court that the options had expired three\n\nmonths   after      his   resignation.          On   the       basis    of   diversity\n\njurisdiction,     House     removed   the       action    to    federal      court   and\n\nasserted two counterclaims:           breach of contract and promissory\n\nestoppel.        House    then   added      a    third     claim       for   negligent\n\n\n\nthe company, the parties generally agree that House never received\nit.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fmisrepresentation.            On   First   Marblehead's   motion   for    summary\n\njudgment, the district court dismissed the case entirely.                       On\n\nappeal, we upheld summary judgment on the breach of contract and\n\npromissory estoppel claims, but vacated and remanded for further\n\nproceedings        on   the   negligent    misrepresentation   claim.

House, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796420\"><a href=\"/opinion/796420/the-first-marblehead-corp-v-gregory-house/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n              As the case proceeded to trial, First Marblehead made it\n\nknown that it intended to call Robert Sherwin as an expert witness\n\nand submitted his expert report.                 House objected to Sherwin's\n\nreport and anticipated testimony, arguing that it was irrelevant\n\nand that Sherwin was not a qualified expert.               The district court\n\ndeclined to rule and reserved the issue for trial.\n\n              At trial, House testified that had he known of the three-\n\nmonth expiration, he would have exercised his options during that\n\nperiod: \"There's zero chance . . . in the God's green earth that I\n\nwas going to let [the options] lapse into worthlessness.                    That\n\nwould not have happened.\"           He claimed, without equivocation, that\n\nhe would have paid the $80,000 necessary at the time to exercise\n\nall 2,500 of his options. He maintained that the company's success\n\nwas \"nearly guaranteed.\" According to House's calculations, had he\n\nexercised his options within the three-month period, the 2,500\n\nshares would have eventually amounted to 150,000 shares of common\n\nstock   (as    a    result    of   subsequent    stock   splits)   and,   had   he\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fcontinued to keep his shares through the company's public offering,\n\nthe value of his stock would have been worth $8.4 million.\n\n           First Marblehead argued, contrary to House's testimony,\n\nthat the company's success was not such a foregone conclusion.                 As\n\nof House's resignation in 1998, the company had lost money during\n\neach of the first seven years since its inception; the market value\n\nof the stock had dropped from $32 per share in 1997 to $20 per\n\nshare in 1998.     Meyers and James both testified that the company\n\nstruggled to obtain necessary financing and it was in a precarious\n\nfinancial situation until the successful acquisition of TERI in\n\n2001 and the company's initial public offering of stock.                    First\n\nMarblehead submitted a 2005 e-mail from House to his brother in\n\nwhich he wrote that in 1998, shortly before leaving the company, he\n\nhad attempted to sell his options back to the company at a\n\nsubstantial discount; House stated that \"the options were not worth\n\na great deal.\"     In the e-mail, House went on to say: \"Seven years\n\nlater, in October of 2003, the company, lo and behold and to my\n\ngreat surprise, went public.\"\n\n           At    issue   in   this   appeal   is    the   testimony    of   First\n\nMarblehead's expert witness, Robert Sherwin, who testified over\n\nHouse's objection.       Sherwin is a certified public accountant, with\n\na   bachelor's   degree    in    economics    and   a   law   degree   from   the\n\nUniversity of Chicago.          At the time of trial, he was employed by\n\nAnalysis Group, a consulting company that specializes in economics,\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\ffinance, and strategy consulting.            He concentrates in two areas of\n\neconomics:       financial economics and industrial organization.\n\n            Sherwin testified that during the three-month period in\n\nwhich House would have had to exercise his stock options (had he\n\nknown of their expiration), the \"stock was not worth $80,000, or\n\nworth at best $80,000.\"          He further testified that in his opinion,\n\nit would not have made financial sense for House to exercise the\n\noptions at that time for several reasons.            First, House would not\n\nhave obtained an immediate financial gain because the stock was not\n\nworth more than the $80,000 House would have had to pay to obtain\n\nthem. Second, First Marblehead was, at the time, a private company\n\nand it would have been more difficult to sell those private shares\n\nthan    shares    in   a   publicly    traded   company.        Third,   such   a\n\nsignificant investment in one stock would be risky and contrary to\n\nthe principle of diversification.            Fourth, Sherwin testified that\n\nHouse's own financial position at the time made such an investment\n\neven riskier: \"House at the time was going through a divorce, had\n\nlimited assets in the bank, he had no stock that he owned . . .\n\n[$80,000 worth of stock] would           probably be more than a hundred\n\npercent of [his investable assets].\"\n\n            On July 23, 2007, the jury returned a verdict in which it\n\nfound    that     House    had    reasonably    relied     on   the   negligent\n\nmisrepresentations of First Marblehead regarding the expiration of\n\nhis incentive stock options. However, the jury concluded that even\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fif House had been aware of the three-month expiration period, he\n\nwould not have exercised the options; the jury thus awarded House\n\nno damages.   The district court denied House's motion for a new\n\ntrial.   House now appeals.\n\n                          II.

With respect to Sherwin's qualifications, House contends\n\nthat Sherwin's experience is limited to industrial organization and\n\nsecurities pricing, and he therefore lacks the expertise to testify\n\nabout how individuals choose investments and arrange portfolios.\n\nHouse argues that such testimony would have been appropriate from\n\na certified financial planner, which Sherwin is not.\n\n           First Marblehead rejects House's myopic view of Sherwin's\n\ncredentials.      Sherwin has nearly two decades of experience as a\n\nconsultant in economics, finance, and strategy consulting.                    With\n\nrespect to his testimony regarding investment diversification,\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fSherwin works on the 401(k) committee at his consulting firm and\n\nadvises employees in their various investments.   Additionally, he\n\ntestified that his experience includes providing investment advice\n\nto accredited investors.   While a certified financial planner who\n\nfocuses entirely on individual investment decisionmaking would also\n\nhave been qualified to provide this testimony, we are unconvinced\n\nthat Sherwin's own credentials are such that he is unqualified to\n\ntestify as an expert in this case.3   See United States v.

In this case, Sherwin's\n\ntestimony was proffered by First Marblehead to explain to the jury\n\nhow stock options function and how an investor would think about\n\nexercising those options.      Those are not topics ordinarily within\n\nthe knowledge of the jury and thus are appropriate for expert\n\ntestimony.    See United States v. Shay, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196160\"><a href=\"/opinion/196160/united-states-v-shay/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 132-33 (1st\n\nCir. 1995) (\"The fundamental question that a court must answer in\n\ndetermining whether a proposed expert's testimony will assist the\n\ntrier of fact is 'whether the untrained layman would be qualified\n\nto determine intelligently and to the best degree, the particular\n\nissue   without   enlightenment   from    those   having   a   specialized\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\funderstanding of the subject matter involved.'\" (quoting United\n\nStates v. Montas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195767\"><a href=\"/opinion/195767/united-states-v-felix-montas/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 783 (1st Cir. 1994)).\n\n          Sherwin    testified   that   based   on   House's   financial\n\ncircumstances in early 1998 and the uncertainty surrounding First\n\nMarblehead's financial future, it would not have made financial\n\nsense for someone in House's position to exercise the options.\n\nSherwin testified that:\n\n          the stock would have been worth no more than\n          the amount [House] would have had to have\n          paid, potentially less than that . . . . [and]\n          the stock would not be particularly suitable\n          for someone in Mr. House's position in terms\n          of the risk and the liquidity and the\n          diversification     areas     of    financial\n          performance.\n\nSherwin explained that an incentive stock option plan provides an\n\nemployee with the opportunity to purchase stock at a set strike\n\nprice and, potentially, realize an immediate financial gain if the\n\nvalue of the stock is higher than the purchase price.      In 1998 when\n\nHouse would have had to decide whether or not to exercise the\n\noptions, he would have had to pay $80,000 for stock that was worth\n\n-- at most, $80,000; House would not have enjoyed any immediate\n\nfinancial gains.    Sherwin further explained that based on House's\n\nfinancial position -- House's salary at the time was $70,000, he\n\nhad only $50,000 in personal assets, and he would have had to\n\nborrow around $30,000 in order to purchase the options -- such a\n\nlarge investment in one privately held company was risky.            The\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that Sherwin's testimony was relevant\n\n                                 -12-\n\fand provided helpful context for the jury was well within the\n\ncourt's broad discretion.\n\n            Testimony   that   provides      a   necessary   context   and\n\nframework, especially in cases involving complex or unfamiliar\n\nconcepts,    can   be   appropriate    for   expert   testimony   without\n\nimproperly interfering with the jury's assessment of credibility.\n\nCf. United States v. Brien, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196183\"><a href=\"/opinion/196183/united-states-v-brien/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 276-77 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(observing that in the context of identification, expert testimony\n\ncould \"give the jury background information about the mechanism of\n\nmemory, types of errors, error rates, and other information not\n\ncommonly possessed by the jury\").        Our review of the record makes\n\nclear that Sherwin's testimony was careful to provide the jury with\n\nthe information to evaluate House's assertions as to what he would\n\nhave done in 1998, and stopped short of giving Sherwin's own\n\nopinion as to what he believed House would have done.         At no point\n\ndid Sherwin opine on the credibility of House's testimony; his\n\ncomments were limited to expressing an opinion on the financial\n\nrisk involved in the decision.    The determination of whether House\n\nwas credible or not was appropriately left to the jury.\n\n            We therefore conclude that the district court's decision\n\nto admit Sherwin's expert testimony was not an abuse of discretion.\n\nHouse also appeals the denial of his Rule 59 motion on the sole\n\nbasis that the admission of Sherwin's testimony was substantial\n\nerror and highly prejudicial.         Given our determination that the\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fdistrict court did not err in deeming Sherwin qualified and his\n\ntestimony relevant, the district court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin denying House's motion for a new trial.   See Crowe, 506 F.3d at\n\n19.\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ndecision to allow the expert testimony and affirm the district\n\ncourt's denial of the motion for a new trial.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f</pre>",
