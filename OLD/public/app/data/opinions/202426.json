In this petition for review, Juan Alvaro\n\nSanta Cruz-Bucheli (\"Santa Cruz\") contests the decision of the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") denying his motion to reopen\n\nhis removal proceedings.          We deny the petition for review and\n\naffirm the decision of the BIA.\n\n                             I.    Background\n\n            Santa Cruz is a native and citizen of Colombia who has\n\nbeen a permanent legal resident of the United States since 1965.\n\nSince his arrival in this country, he has been convicted of several\n\noffenses.    Most relevant to this petition is Santa Cruz's May 23,\n\n1996 conviction in a Florida state court for attempted trafficking\n\nof a controlled substance (i.e., cocaine).\n\n            On July 25, 1996, Santa Cruz was placed in removal\n\nproceedings    when   the   Immigration    and   Naturalization   Service\n\n(\"INS\")1 issued an Order to Show Cause charging him, inter alia,\n\nwith being removable under § 241(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and\n\nNationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(B)(i), as an alien\n\nconvicted of a violation of any law relating to a controlled\n\nsubstance.\n\n\n\n\n1\n   The functions of the INS have since been transferred to the\nBureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of the\nDepartment of Homeland Security.     See Homeland Security Act of\n2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, § 471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as\namended at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)). For simplicity, we refer to the INS\nthroughout this opinion.\n\n                                     -2-\n\f           In   late   August    1996,      a   hearing       was   held   before    an\n\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\") to determine whether Santa Cruz should be\n\nremoved. During this hearing, Santa Cruz requested a discretionary\n\nwaiver of removal under former § 212(c) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1182\n\n(c) (repealed 1996).2        The INS argued that because of Santa Cruz's\n\ncontrolled substance conviction and the restrictions promulgated\n\nunder the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996,\n\nPub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (\"AEDPA\"), he was ineligible\n\nfor a discretionary waiver of removal under § 212(c).                         The IJ\n\nagreed with the INS and ordered Santa Cruz's removal to Colombia.\n\n           Santa Cruz appealed the order to the BIA.                       On May 21,\n\n1997, the BIA affirmed the decision of the IJ, finding Santa Cruz\n\nstatutorily ineligible for a § 212(c) discretionary waiver because\n\nof his conviction for a controlled substance offense.                        The BIA\n\nissued a final order of removal.\n\n           However,     on    June    30,    1999,      the    Assistant     District\n\nDirector   of   the    INS   stayed    the      order    of    removal     pending    a\n\n\n\n2\n   Under former § 212(c), an alien could seek from the Attorney\nGeneral a discretionary waiver of removal if the alien was\n\"lawfully admitted for permanent residence [and] temporarily\nproceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,\nand who [was] returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of\nseven consecutive years.\"    8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (repealed 1996).\nWhile this statute literally would not apply to Santa Cruz because\nhe did not proceed abroad voluntarily, it has been judicially\nenlarged to apply to give \"the Attorney General discretionary\nauthority to waive deportation for aliens already within the United\nStates who were deportable.\" Wallace v. Reno, 194 F.3d 279, 281\n(1999).\n\n                                       -3-\n\fdetermination that Santa Cruz, despite the decisions of the IJ and\n\nBIA, might nevertheless have qualified for a § 212(c) waiver of\n\nremoval under In re Soriano, 21 I. & N. Dec. 516 (BIA 1996, A.G.\n\n1997).3   While this determination was pending, Santa Cruz was\n\nreleased from custody.      After the BIA determined that Santa Cruz\n\nwas in fact ineligible for § 212(c) relief under In re Soriano, he\n\nwas arrested on May 5, 2005.\n\n          On May 17, 2005, Santa Cruz filed a motion to reopen with\n\nthe BIA, asking the BIA to remand his case to an immigration judge\n\nfor reconsideration of his eligibility for a § 212(c) waiver in\n\nlight of the Supreme Court's decision in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S.\n\n289 (2001).    On June 18, 2005, the BIA denied the motion.         The BIA\n\ndecided that the restrictions set forth in § 440(d) of AEDPA\n\ngoverned Santa Cruz's eligibility for a waiver under § 212(c) and\n\nthat   Santa   Cruz   was   ineligible   for   a   waiver   under    these\n\nrestrictions.4   Santa Cruz now appeals the BIA's decision.\n\n\n3\n   In In re Soriano, the BIA held that § 440(d) of AEDPA did not\napply to § 212(c) requests pending as of April 24, 1996, when AEDPA\nbecame effective. Because Santa Cruz filed his application for a\n§ 212(c) waiver after April 24, 1996, he did not qualify for In re\nSoriano relief.\n4\n  AEDPA had an effective date of April 24, 1996. On September 30,\n1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\nResponsibility Act (\"IIRIRA\"), which eliminated § 212(c) relief\nentirely, effective April 1, 1997. See IIRIRA, Pub. L. No. 104-\n208, § 304(b), 110 Stat. 3009-546, 597 (1996). In Santa Cruz's\ncase, the BIA explained that because Santa Cruz's controlled\nsubstance conviction occurred on May 23, 1996 -- after the\neffective date of AEDPA but before the effective date of IIRIRA --\nhis eligibility for a § 212(c) waiver was governed by § 212(c) as\n\n                                  -4-\n\f                            II.   Discussion\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n            We review the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen for\n\nabuse of discretion.   See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992);\n\nFalae v. Gonzáles, 411 F.3d 11, 14 (1st Cir. 2006).      We find an\n\nabuse of discretion if the BIA has made an error of law or acted in\n\na manner that is arbitrary or capricious.      See Carter v. INS, 90\n\nF.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 1996); see also Henry v. INS, 74 F.3d 1, 4\n\n(1st Cir. 1996) (further explaining that we would find an abuse of\n\ndiscretion if the BIA considered improper factors, failed to\n\nconsider a relevant factor, or assigned a factor improper weight in\n\nmaking a determination).\n\nB.   The Motion to Reopen\n\n            Santa Cruz argues that the BIA erred in denying his\n\nmotion to reopen because it improperly applied § 440(d) of AEDPA to\n\nbar him from seeking a waiver of removal under former § 212(c) of\n\nthe INA.5   Section 440(d) of AEDPA made an alien ineligible for a\n\nwaiver of removal if he or she had committed inter alia, any\n\noffense covered in § 241(a)(2)(B)(i) of the INA, which includes \"a\n\n\n\namended by AEDPA as it stood prior to the enactment of IIRIRA. The\nBIA found that under § 440(d) of AEDPA, § 212(c) relief is not\navailable to aliens such as Santa Cruz who are removable by reason\nof having committed a controlled substance offense.\n5\n  In other words, Santa Cruz is arguing that because AEDPA did not\napply, he would be eligible to seek a waiver of removal because he\nsatisfies all of the requirements of former § 212(c).\n\n                                   -5-\n\fviolation of any law or regulation of a State, the United States,\n\nor a foreign country relating to a controlled substance.\"      Santa\n\nCruz contends that § 440(d) of AEDPA may not be applied to bar\n\n§ 212(c) relief to an alien who engaged in criminal conduct prior\n\nto the effective date of AEDPA but who has been convicted by a\n\nguilty plea made after the effective date of AEDPA.       Santa Cruz\n\noffers three cases in support of this argument.\n\n          First, Santa Cruz argues that the Supreme Court's holding\n\nin INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001), bars the application of\n\nAEDPA to his request for a waiver of removal.6       In St. Cyr, the\n\nCourt held that IIRIRA could not be applied retroactively to bar\n\n§ 212(c) relief to an alien who had entered into a plea bargain\n\nbefore the effective date of IIRIRA.   Id. at 326.   The Court noted\n\nthat \"preserving the possibility [of § 212(c) relief] would have\n\nbeen one of the principal benefits sought by defendants deciding\n\nwhether to accept a plea bargain.\"   Id. at 323.   Because aliens may\n\nhave relied on the availability of § 212(c) relief when entering\n\ninto plea bargains, the Court held that \"§ 212(c) relief remains\n\navailable for aliens [who] . . . would have been eligible for\n\n§ 212(c) relief at the time of their plea.\"    Id. at 326 (emphasis\n\nadded). When Santa Cruz entered into his plea agreement on May 23,\n\n\n6\n   Although St. Cyr dealt with the retroactive application of\nIIRIRA, we have recognized that its logic is equally applicable to\nsimilarly configured cases where AEDPA would bar a waiver of\nremoval under § 212(c). See Leitao v. Reno, 311 F.3d 453, 455 n.3\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                               -6-\n\f19967 he was no longer eligible for § 212(c) relief because AEDPA\n\nhad already been effective for one month.            Santa Cruz's position\n\nwas rejected in our decision in Lawrence v. Gonzáles, 446 F.3d 221,\n\n225 (1st Cir. 2006), in which we held that the proper date to be\n\nused in determining the applicability of § 440(d) of AEDPA is the\n\ndate of conviction.       We specifically stated that \"the date of\n\ncriminal conduct is irrelevant.\" Id.; see also Khan v. Ashcroft,\n\n352 F.3d 521, 525 (2d Cir. 2001) (\"§ 440(d) is not impermissibly\n\nretroactive as applied to aliens . . . who pleaded guilty following\n\nAEDPA's effective date, even if the criminal conduct underlying\n\ntheir convictions took place before AEDPA's date\").          Unlike in St.\n\nCyr, Santa Cruz could not have reasonably relied on the possibility\n\nof § 212(c) relief when he decided to enter into the plea bargain.\n\nAs we explained in Lawrence v. Gonzáles, 446 F.3d 221, 225 (1st\n\nCir. 2006), Santa Cruz \"had no basis for assuming (as part of his\n\nplea or otherwise) that section 212(c) relief would be potentially\n\navailable as part of the quid pro quo for the plea.\"          Furthermore,\n\nthe reasoning in St. Cyr would not extend to Santa Cruz's conduct\n\nbecause   it   is   unlikely   that   Santa   Cruz   was   relying   on   the\n\n\n7\n   Santa Cruz also alleges that he was unable to enter into a plea\nbargain prior to April 24, 1996, the effective date of AEDPA,\nbecause he was in detention in Puerto Rico, rather than in Florida\n(where he had been charged). See Pet. Br. at 8. However, Santa\nCruz provides no explanation as to what prevented him from making\nthe plea bargain while situated in Puerto Rico, and his own\nsubmissions seem to suggest that he was ordered transferred to\nFlorida on April 17, 1996, a full week before the effective date of\nAEDPA. Accordingly, we decline to address this argument.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fpossibility of a waiver of removal when he decided to commit his\n\ncrime in 1986.    See, e.g., Magana-Pizano v. INS, 200 F.3d 603, 612\n\n(9th Cir. 1999) (\"It is difficult to argue, for example, that a\n\nconvict would have refrained from committing the criminal act if he\n\nhad   just    known    of   the   potential      for   future     deportation\n\nconsequences.\").       Accordingly, St. Cyr provides no support for\n\nSanta Cruz's contention that § 440(d) of AEDPA should not apply to\n\nhis application for § 212(c) relief.\n\n             Second,   Santa   Cruz   suggests    that   our     decision   in\n\nGoncalves v. Reno, 144 F.3d 110 (1st Cir. 1998), supports his\n\ncontention that § 440(d) of AEDPA does not apply to his application\n\nfor a § 212(c) waiver.         In Goncalves, we held that § 440(d) of\n\nAEDPA would not apply to an application for § 212(c) relief filed\n\nprior to the effective date of AEDPA.         Id. at 133.       We noted that\n\nneither the text nor the legislative history of AEDPA suggested\n\nthat Congress had meant § 440(d) to apply to applications for\n\n§ 212(c) relief already pending on the effective date.            Id. at 128-\n\n33.   However, unlike in Goncalves, where the application for a\n\n§ 212(c) waiver was made before AEDPA became effective, Santa Cruz\n\nmade his application for a § 212(c) waiver after AEDPA became\n\neffective and barred him from relief.8        Because § 440(d) of AEDPA\n\n\n8\n   Contrary to his claim, Santa Cruz never had an \"expectancy\" to\napply for a § 212(c) waiver. Prior to his conviction, Santa Cruz\nhad no expectation of a § 212(c) waiver because he was not subject\nto removal and thus was ineligible (and had no need) to apply for\na waiver. After Santa Cruz's conviction for controlled substances\n\n                                      -8-\n\fhad already made Santa Cruz ineligible for a § 212(c) waiver before\n\nhe submitted his application, Goncalves fails to lend support to\n\nSanta Cruz's position.\n\n           Third, Santa Cruz contends that the holding in Henderson\n\nv. INS, 157 F.3d 106 (2d Cir. 1998), provides support for his\n\nargument that § 440(d) of AEDPA does not apply to his application\n\nfor § 212(c) relief.     In Henderson, the Second Circuit held that\n\n§ 440(d) did not apply to an alien seeking § 212(c) relief whose\n\nremoval proceeding had commenced prior to the effective date of\n\nAEDPA.   Id. at 130.   As in Goncalves, the Second Circuit noted that\n\nthere was no evidence of congressional intent to make § 440(d)\n\napplicable to pending immigration proceedings.    However, unlike in\n\nHenderson, where removal proceedings began before AEDPA became\n\neffective, removal proceedings against Santa Cruz did not commence\n\nuntil July 25, 1996, more than three months after the effective\n\ndate of AEDPA.   Because AEDPA became effective before Santa Cruz\n\nwas subject to removal proceedings, Henderson also fails to support\n\nhis position.\n\n           Accordingly, we conclude that § 440(d) of AEDPA does\n\napply to Santa Cruz's application for a waiver of removal under\n\nformer § 212(c) of the INA.     Santa Cruz does not contest the fact\n\nthat he was convicted by a Florida court of attempted trafficking\n\n\ntrafficking made him subject to removal, he could have no\nexpectation of a waiver because by that time, § 440(d) of AEDPA\nmade him ineligible to seek a § 212(c) waiver.\n\n                                  -9-\n\fof a controlled substance.     Under § 440(d) of AEDPA, an alien\n\nconvicted of any offense relating to a controlled substance is no\n\nlonger eligible for a waiver of removal under § 212(c).     Thus,\n\nbecause Santa Cruz was ineligible for a § 212(c) waiver, the BIA's\n\ndecision to deny his motion to reopen was neither arbitrary nor\n\ncapricious, nor did it make an error of law.\n\n                        III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we deny the petition for\n\nreview and affirm the decision of the BIA.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <i>See INS v. Doherty,</i> 502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <i>Falae v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> 411 F.3d 11, 14 (1st Cir.2005). We find an abuse of discretion if the BIA has made an error of law or acted in a manner that is arbitrary or capricious. <i>See Carter v. INS,</i> 90 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir.1996); <i>see also Henry v. INS,</i> 74 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1996) (further explaining that we would find an abuse of discretion if the BIA considered improper factors, failed to consider a relevant factor, or assigned a factor improper weight in making a determination).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Motion to Reopen</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santa Cruz argues that the BIA erred in denying his motion to reopen because it improperly applied &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA to bar him from seeking a waiver of removal under former &#167; 212(c) of the INA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Section 440(d) of AEDPA made an alien ineligible for a waiver of removal if he or she had committed <i>inter alia,</i> any offense covered in &#167; 241(a)(2)(B)(i) of the INA, which includes \"a violation of any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance.\" Santa Cruz contends that &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA may not be applied to bar &#167; 212(c) relief to an alien who engaged in criminal conduct prior to the effective date of AEDPA but who has been convicted by a guilty plea made after the effective date of AEDPA. Santa Cruz offers three cases in support of this argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Santa Cruz argues that the Supreme Court's holding in <i>INS v. St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), bars the application of AEDPA to his request for a waiver of removal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In <i>St. Cyr,</i> the Court held that IIRIRA could not be applied retroactively to bar &#167; 212(c) relief to an alien who had entered into a plea bargain before the effective date of IIRIRA. <i>Id.</i> at 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271. The Court noted that \"preserving the possibility [of &#167; 212(c) relief] would have been one of the principal benefits sought by defendants deciding whether to accept a plea bargain.\" <i>Id.</i> at 323, 121 S.Ct. 2271. Because aliens may have relied on the availability of &#167; 212(c) relief when entering into plea bargains, the Court held that \" &#167; 212(c) relief remains available for aliens [who] . . . would have been eligible for &#167; 212(c) relief <i>at the time of their plea.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (emphasis added). When Santa Cruz entered into his plea agreement on May 23, 1996<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> he was no longer eligible for &#167; 212(c) relief because AEDPA had already been effective for one month. Santa Cruz's position was rejected in our decision in <i>Lawrence v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> 446 F.3d 221, 225 (1st Cir.2006), in which we held that the proper date to be used in determining the applicability of &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA is the date of conviction. We specifically stated that \"the date of criminal conduct is irrelevant.\" <i>Id.; see also Khan v. Ashcroft,</i> 352 F.3d 521, 525 (2d Cir.2003) (\" &#167; 440(d) is not impermissibly retroactive as applied to aliens . . . who pleaded guilty following AEDPA's effective date, even if the criminal conduct underlying their convictions took place before AEDPA's date\"). Unlike in <i>St. Cyr,</i> Santa Cruz could not have reasonably relied on the possibility of &#167; 212(c) relief when he decided to enter into the plea bargain. As we explained in <i>Lawrence v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> 446 F.3d 221, 225 (1st Cir.2006), Santa Cruz \"had no basis for assuming (as part of his plea or otherwise) that section 212(c) relief would be potentially available as part of the quid pro quo for the plea.\" Furthermore, the reasoning in <i>St. Cyr</i> would not extend to Santa Cruz's conduct because it is unlikely that Santa Cruz was relying on the possibility of a waiver of removal when he decided to commit his crime in 1986. <i>See, e.g., Magana-Pizano v. INS,</i> 200 F.3d 603, 612 (9th Cir.1999) (\"It is difficult to argue, for example, that a convict would have refrained from committing the criminal act if he had just known of the potential for future deportation consequences.\"). Accordingly, <i>St. Cyr</i> provides no support for Santa Cruz's contention that &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA should not apply to his application for &#167; 212(c) relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Santa Cruz suggests that our decision in <i>Goncalves v. Reno,</i> 144 F.3d 110 (1st Cir.1998), supports his contention that &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA does not apply to his application for a &#167; 212(c) waiver. In <i>Goncalves,</i> we held that &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA would not apply to an application for &#167; 212(c) relief filed prior to the effective date of AEDPA. <i>Id.</i> at 133. We noted that neither the text nor the legislative history of AEDPA suggested that Congress had meant &#167; 440(d) to apply to applications for &#167; 212(c) relief already pending on the effective date. <i>Id.</i> at 128-33. However, unlike in <i>Goncalves,</i> where the application for a &#167; 212(c) waiver was made before AEDPA became effective, Santa Cruz made his application for a &#167; 212(c) waiver after AEDPA became effective and barred him from relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Because &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA had already made Santa Cruz ineligible for a &#167; 212(c) waiver before he submitted his application, <i>Goncalves</i> fails to lend support to Santa Cruz's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Santa Cruz contends that the holding in <i>Henderson v. INS,</i> 157 F.3d 106 (2d Cir.1998), provides support for his argument that &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA does not apply to his application for &#167; 212(c) relief. In <i>Henderson,</i> the Second Circuit held that &#167; 440(d) did not apply to an alien seeking &#167; 212(c) relief whose removal proceeding had commenced prior to the effective date of AEDPA. <i>Id.</i> at 130. As in <i>Goncalves,</i> the Second Circuit noted that there was no evidence of congressional intent to make &#167; 440(d) applicable to pending immigration proceedings. However, unlike in <i>Henderson,</i> where removal proceedings began before AEDPA became effective, removal proceedings against Santa Cruz did not commence until July 25, 1996, more than three months after the effective date of AEDPA. Because AEDPA became effective before Santa Cruz was subject to removal proceedings, <i>Henderson</i> also fails to support his position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we conclude that &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA does apply to Santa Cruz's application for a waiver of removal under former &#167; 212(c) of the INA. Santa Cruz does not contest the fact that he was convicted by a Florida court of attempted trafficking of a controlled substance. Under &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA, an alien convicted of any offense relating to a controlled substance is no longer eligible for a waiver of removal under &#167; 212(c). Thus, because Santa Cruz was ineligible for a &#167; 212(c) waiver, the BIA's decision to deny his motion to reopen was neither arbitrary nor capricious, nor did it make an error of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we deny the petition for review and affirm the decision of the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The functions of the INS have since been transferred to the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security<i>See</i> Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L.

While this statute literally would not apply to Santa Cruz because he did not proceed abroad voluntarily, it has been judicially enlarged to apply to give \"the Attorney General discretionary authority to waive deportation for aliens already within the United States who were deportable.\"<i>Wallace v. Reno,</i> 194 F.3d 279, 281 (1999).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In<i>In re Soriano,</i> the BIA held that &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA did not apply to &#167; 212(c) requests pending as of April 24, 1996, when AEDPA became effective. Because Santa Cruz filed his application for a &#167; 212(c) waiver after April 24, 1996, he did not qualify for <i>In re Soriano</i> relief.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> AEDPA had an effective date of April 24, 1996. On September 30, 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\"IIRIRA\"), which eliminated &#167; 212(c) relief entirely, effective April 1, 1997<i>See</i> IIRIRA, Pub.L. No. 104-208, &#167; 304(b), 110 Stat. 3009-546, 597 (1996). In Santa Cruz's case, the BIA explained that because Santa Cruz's controlled substance conviction occurred on May 23, 1996 &#8212; after the effective date of AEDPA but before the effective date of IIRIRA &#8212; his eligibility for a &#167; 212(c) waiver was governed by &#167; 212(c) as amended by AEDPA as it stood prior to the enactment of IIRIRA. The BIA found that under &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA, &#167; 212(c) relief is not available to aliens such as Santa Cruz who are removable by reason of having committed a controlled substance offense.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In other words, Santa Cruz is arguing that because AEDPA did not apply, he would be eligible to seek a waiver of removal because he satisfies all of the requirements of former &#167; 212(c)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Although<i>St. Cyr</i> dealt with the retroactive application of IIRIRA, we have recognized that its logic is equally applicable to similarly configured cases where AEDPA would bar a waiver of removal under &#167; 212(c). <i>See Leitao v. Reno,</i> 311 F.3d 453, 455 n. 3 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Santa Cruz also alleges that he was unable to enter into a plea bargain prior to April 24, 1996, the effective date of AEDPA, because he was in detention in Puerto Rico, rather than in Florida (where he had been charged)<i>See</i> Pet. Br. at 8. However, Santa Cruz provides no explanation as to what prevented him from making the plea bargain while situated in Puerto Rico, and his own submissions seem to suggest that he was ordered transferred to Florida on April 17, 1996, a full week before the effective date of AEDPA. Accordingly, we decline to address this argument.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Contrary to his claim, Santa Cruz never had an \"expectancy\" to apply for a &#167; 212(c) waiver. Prior to his conviction, Santa Cruz had no expectation of a &#167; 212(c) waiver because he was not subject to removal and thus was ineligible (and had no need) to apply for a waiver. After Santa Cruz's conviction for controlled substances trafficking made him subject to removal, he could have no expectation of a waiver because by that time, &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA made him ineligible to seek a &#167; 212(c) waiver</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Since his arrival in this country, he has been convicted of several offenses. Most relevant to this petition is Santa Cruz's May 23, 1996 conviction in a Florida state court for attempted trafficking of a controlled substance (i.e., cocaine).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 25, 1996, Santa Cruz was placed in removal proceedings when the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> issued an Order to Show Cause charging him, <i>inter alia,</i> with being removable under &#167; 241(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1251(a)(2)(B)(i), as an alien convicted of a violation of any law relating to a controlled substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late August 1996, a hearing was held before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") to determine whether Santa Cruz should be removed. During this hearing, Santa Cruz requested a discretionary waiver of removal under former &#167; 212(c) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c) (repealed 1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The INS argued that because of Santa Cruz's controlled substance conviction and the restrictions promulgated under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (\"AEDPA\"), he was ineligible for a discretionary waiver of removal under &#167; 212(c).

On May 21, 1997, the BIA affirmed the decision of the IJ, finding Santa Cruz statutorily ineligible for a &#167; 212(c) discretionary waiver because of his conviction for a controlled substance offense.

Santa Cruz offers three cases in support of this argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Santa Cruz argues that the Supreme Court's holding in <i>INS v. St. Cyr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118452\"><a href=\"/opinion/118452/ins-v-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118452\"><a href=\"/opinion/118452/ins-v-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span> (2001), bars the application of AEDPA to his request for a waiver of removal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In <i>St. Cyr,</i> the Court held that IIRIRA could not be applied retroactively to bar &#167; 212(c) relief to an alien who had entered into a plea bargain before the effective date of IIRIRA. <i>Id.</i> at 326, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118452\"><a href=\"/opinion/118452/ins-v-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2271</span></a></span>. The Court noted that \"preserving the possibility [of &#167; 212(c) relief] would have been one of the principal benefits sought by defendants deciding whether to accept a plea bargain.\" <i>Id.</i> at 323, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118452\"><a href=\"/opinion/118452/ins-v-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2271</span></a></span>. Because aliens may have relied on the availability of &#167; 212(c) relief when entering into plea bargains, the Court held that \" &#167; 212(c) relief remains available for aliens [who] . . . would have been eligible for &#167; 212(c) relief <i>at the time of their plea.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 326, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118452\"><a href=\"/opinion/118452/ins-v-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2271</span></a></span> (emphasis added). When Santa Cruz entered into his plea agreement on May 23, 1996<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> he was no longer eligible for &#167; 212(c) relief because AEDPA had already been effective for one month. Santa Cruz's position was rejected in our decision in <i>Lawrence v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202194\"><a href=\"/opinion/202194/orumwense-lawrence-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span>, 225 (1st Cir.2006), in which we held that the proper date to be used in determining the applicability of &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA is the date of conviction. We specifically stated that \"the date of criminal conduct is irrelevant.\" <i>Id.; see also Khan v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784471\"><a href=\"/opinion/784471/fazila-khan-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united-states-doris/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span>, 525 (2d Cir.2003) (\" &#167; 440(d) is not impermissibly retroactive as applied to aliens . . . who pleaded guilty following AEDPA's effective date, even if the criminal conduct underlying their convictions took place before AEDPA's date\"). Unlike in <i>St. Cyr,</i> Santa Cruz could not have reasonably relied on the possibility of &#167; 212(c) relief when he decided to enter into the plea bargain. As we explained in <i>Lawrence v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202194\"><a href=\"/opinion/202194/orumwense-lawrence-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span>, 225 (1st Cir.2006), Santa Cruz \"had no basis for assuming (as part of his plea or otherwise) that section 212(c) relief would be potentially available as part of the quid pro quo for the plea.\" Furthermore, the reasoning in <i>St. Cyr</i> would not extend to Santa Cruz's conduct because it is unlikely that Santa Cruz was relying on the possibility of a waiver of removal when he decided to commit his crime in 1986. <i>See, e.g., Magana-Pizano v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767252\"><a href=\"/opinion/767252/daniel-magana-pizano-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, 612 (9th Cir.1999) (\"It is difficult to argue, for example, that a convict would have refrained from committing the criminal act if he had just known of the potential for future deportation consequences.\"). Accordingly, <i>St. Cyr</i> provides no support for Santa Cruz's contention that &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA should not apply to his application for &#167; 212(c) relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Santa Cruz suggests that our decision in <i>Goncalves v. Reno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197952\"><a href=\"/opinion/197952/perceira-goncalves-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1998), supports his contention that &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA does not apply to his application for a &#167; 212(c) waiver. In <i>Goncalves,</i> we held that &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA would not apply to an application for &#167; 212(c) relief filed prior to the effective date of AEDPA. <i>Id.</i> at 133. We noted that neither the text nor the legislative history of AEDPA suggested that Congress had meant &#167; 440(d) to apply to applications for &#167; 212(c) relief already pending on the effective date. <i>Id.</i> at 128-33. However, unlike in <i>Goncalves,</i> where the application for a &#167; 212(c) waiver was made before AEDPA became effective, Santa Cruz made his application for a &#167; 212(c) waiver after AEDPA became effective and barred him from relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Because &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA had already made Santa Cruz ineligible for a &#167; 212(c) waiver before he submitted his application, <i>Goncalves</i> fails to lend support to Santa Cruz's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Santa Cruz contends that the holding in <i>Henderson v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758325\"><a href=\"/opinion/758325/franklin-henderson-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service-saul-navas-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1998), provides support for his argument that &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA does not apply to his application for &#167; 212(c) relief. In <i>Henderson,</i> the Second Circuit held that &#167; 440(d) did not apply to an alien seeking &#167; 212(c) relief whose removal proceeding had commenced prior to the effective date of AEDPA. <i>Id.</i> at 130. As in <i>Goncalves,</i> the Second Circuit noted that there was no evidence of congressional intent to make &#167; 440(d) applicable to pending immigration proceedings. However, unlike in <i>Henderson,</i> where removal proceedings began before AEDPA became effective, removal proceedings against Santa Cruz did not commence until July 25, 1996, more than three months after the effective date of AEDPA. Because AEDPA became effective before Santa Cruz was subject to removal proceedings, <i>Henderson</i> also fails to support his position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we conclude that &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA does apply to Santa Cruz's application for a waiver of removal under former &#167; 212(c) of the INA. Santa Cruz does not contest the fact that he was convicted by a Florida court of attempted trafficking of a controlled substance. Under &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA, an alien convicted of any offense relating to a controlled substance is no longer eligible for a waiver of removal under &#167; 212(c). Thus, because Santa Cruz was ineligible for a &#167; 212(c) waiver, the BIA's decision to deny his motion to reopen was neither arbitrary nor capricious, nor did it make an error of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we deny the petition for review and affirm the decision of the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The functions of the INS have since been transferred to the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security<i>See</i> Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-296, &#167; 471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. &#167; 291(a)). For simplicity, we refer to the INS throughout this opinion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Under former &#167; 212(c), an alien could seek from the Attorney General a discretionary waiver of removal if the alien was \"lawfully admitted for permanent residence [and] temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who [was] returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c) (repealed 1996). While this statute literally would not apply to Santa Cruz because he did not proceed abroad voluntarily, it has been judicially enlarged to apply to give \"the Attorney General discretionary authority to waive deportation for aliens already within the United States who were deportable.\"<i>Wallace v. Reno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198695\"><a href=\"/opinion/198695/wolde-wallace-v-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span>, 281 (1999).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In<i>In re Soriano,</i> the BIA held that &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA did not apply to &#167; 212(c) requests pending as of April 24, 1996, when AEDPA became effective. Because Santa Cruz filed his application for a &#167; 212(c) waiver after April 24, 1996, he did not qualify for <i>In re Soriano</i> relief.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> AEDPA had an effective date of April 24, 1996. On September 30, 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\"IIRIRA\"), which eliminated &#167; 212(c) relief entirely, effective April 1, 1997<i>See</i> IIRIRA, Pub.L. No. 104-208, &#167; 304(b), 110 Stat. 3009-546, 597 (1996). In Santa Cruz's case, the BIA explained that because Santa Cruz's controlled substance conviction occurred on May 23, 1996 &#8212; after the effective date of AEDPA but before the effective date of IIRIRA &#8212; his eligibility for a &#167; 212(c) waiver was governed by &#167; 212(c) as amended by AEDPA as it stood prior to the enactment of IIRIRA. The BIA found that under &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA, &#167; 212(c) relief is not available to aliens such as Santa Cruz who are removable by reason of having committed a controlled substance offense.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In other words, Santa Cruz is arguing that because AEDPA did not apply, he would be eligible to seek a waiver of removal because he satisfies all of the requirements of former &#167; 212(c)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Although<i>St. Cyr</i> dealt with the retroactive application of IIRIRA, we have recognized that its logic is equally applicable to similarly configured cases where AEDPA would bar a waiver of removal under &#167; 212(c). <i>See Leitao v. Reno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200222\"><a href=\"/opinion/200222/leitao-v-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 455 n. 3 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Santa Cruz also alleges that he was unable to enter into a plea bargain prior to April 24, 1996, the effective date of AEDPA, because he was in detention in Puerto Rico, rather than in Florida (where he had been charged)<i>See</i> Pet. Br. at 8. However, Santa Cruz provides no explanation as to what prevented him from making the plea bargain while situated in Puerto Rico, and his own submissions seem to suggest that he was ordered transferred to Florida on April 17, 1996, a full week before the effective date of AEDPA. Accordingly, we decline to address this argument.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Contrary to his claim, Santa Cruz never had an \"expectancy\" to apply for a &#167; 212(c) waiver. Prior to his conviction, Santa Cruz had no expectation of a &#167; 212(c) waiver because he was not subject to removal and thus was ineligible (and had no need) to apply for a waiver. After Santa Cruz's conviction for controlled substances trafficking made him subject to removal, he could have no expectation of a waiver because by that time, &#167; 440(d) of AEDPA made him ineligible to seek a &#167; 212(c) waiver</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
