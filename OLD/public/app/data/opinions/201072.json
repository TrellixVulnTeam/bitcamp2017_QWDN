Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                 Selya and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Linda L. Ellison on brief pro se.\n     Daniel J. Mullen, Associate Attorney General, on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                             June 21, 2004\n\f           Per Curiam. The pro se plaintiff in this case asked the\n\ndistrict court to order the defendant Chief Justice of the New\n\nHampshire Supreme Court to vacate orders declining plaintiff's\n\nappeal to that court.        As grounds for that relief, plaintiff\n\nalleged that one of the other state Supreme Court justices (Justice\n\nBroderick) who participated in the decision to decline her appeal\n\nformerly represented the defendant University of New Hampshire in\n\nother matters.      Plaintiff also asked the district court to award\n\ndamages against the Chief Justice because he allegedly \"allowed\"\n\nJustice Broderick to participate in the case.\n\n           The district court dismissed plaintiff's claims as barred\n\nby the Rooker-Feldman doctrine1 and by absolute judicial immunity.\n\nHaving   reviewed    de   novo   the    district   court's   allowance   of\n\ndefendant's motion to dismiss, \"keeping in mind that a complaint\n\nmay be dismissed for failure to state a claim \"'only if it is clear\n\nthat no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could\n\nbe proved consistent with the allegations,'\"             Pena-Borrero v.\n\nEstremeda 365 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 2004) (citations omitted), we\n\naffirm the dismissal on Rooker-Feldman grounds, without reaching\n\nthe judicial immunity ground also relied on by the district court.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Under that doctrine, articulated by the United States Supreme\nCourt in District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S.\n462 (1983), and Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413 (1923),\nfederal district courts lack appellate jurisdiction to review\nstate-court decisions.\n\n                                       -2-\n\f             After judgment, plaintiff moved for reconsideration of\n\nthe dismissal.    As grounds for that motion, in addition to arguing\n\nthat the court had erred in granting the motion to dismiss,\n\nplaintiff claimed, for the first time, that the district court\n\njudge, Judge McAuliffe, was disqualified from deciding the case.\n\nIn support of that claim, plaintiff alleged that Judge McAuliffe\n\nhad served as a trustee of the University of New Hampshire at the\n\ntime that the university decided to purchase the land that was the\n\nsubject of plaintiff's state-court homestead claim.           The district\n\ncourt denied that motion.           We decline to vacate the district\n\ncourt's judgment because any error in declining to recuse was\n\nharmless.\n\nMotion to Dismiss\n\n             As the district court stated, \"[T]o the extent plaintiff\n\nseeks relief in the nature of a 'reversal' or 'vacation' of orders\n\nentered in her state litigation by the New Hampshire Supreme Court,\n\n[the district court was] without jurisdiction to consider her\n\nclaim.\"    See Hill v. Town of Conway, 193 F.3d 33, 40 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(finding Rooker-Feldman doctrine applicable where the relief sought\n\n\"'would, if granted, effectively void the state court's judgment'\"\n\n(citation omitted)).     Here, the injunctive relief plaintiff sought\n\nfrom   the   district   court–\"to    vacate   all   orders   in    regard   to\n\n[plaintiff's appeal] and issue new orders with only qualified\n\njustices     participating   in   the   decision,\"–\"would,    if    granted,\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\feffectively void the state court's judgment.\"         That relief is\n\ntherefore clearly barred by Rooker-Feldman.\n\n           For the same reasons, plaintiff's claim for damages is\n\nalso barred.   The premise of plaintiff's damage claim is that the\n\nNew Hampshire Supreme Court was incorrect in denying plaintiff's\n\nvarious motions for relief from judgment based on the alleged\n\ndisqualification of Justice Broderick.      Therefore, the district\n\ncourt \"could not give the [plaintiff] the relief [she] seek[s]\n\nwithout in effect reviewing and reversing the [New Hampshire]\n\ncourt,\" Newman v. Indiana, 129 F.3d 937, 942 (7th Cir. 1997), which\n\nRooker-Feldman forbids.   Id.; see also Wilson v. Shumway, 264 F.3d\n\n120, 121, 126 (1st Cir. 2001) (affirming dismissal of damages claims\n\nunder Rooker-Feldman).\n\nMotion for Reconsideration Based on Judge McAuliffe's Alleged\nDisqualification\n\n           In support of her recusal request, plaintiff alleged\n\nthat: (1) in 1993, as a trustee of the University of New Hampshire,\n\nSteven McAuliffe \"spoke very much in favor\" of acquiring certain\n\nland known as Leawood Orchards \"and encouraged the other trustee[s]\n\nto do so,\" and (2) Leawood Orchards is the property that was the\n\nsubject of plaintiff's state-court homestead claim.     Some of these\n\nallegations are supported] by minutes of a Board of Trustees'\n\nmeeting,   which   indicate   that   \"Trustee   McAuliffe   asked   for\n\nreconsideration of the proposal for UNH to acquire the Leawoods\n\nOrchards property\" and that Trustee McAuliffe spoke in favor of\n\n                                 -4-\n\facquiring the property.              However, the record contains no evidence\n\nas   to,      among   other     things,     whether    plaintiff       had    claimed     a\n\nhomestead interest in that property at that time, whether Trustee\n\nMcAuliffe was aware of any such interest when he spoke in favor of\n\nacquiring the property or at any time thereafter, or whether Judge\n\nMcAuliffe       was   still     a    trustee   at   the    time   he   presided       over\n\nplaintiff's case.\n\n               We need not resolve this issue because, \"[a]s in other\n\nareas of the law, there is surely room for harmless error committed\n\nby     busy    judges     who       inadvertently     overlook     a     disqualifying\n\ncircumstance.\"          Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., 486\n\nU.S. 847, 862 (1987).               \"Although § 455 defines the circumstances\n\nthat    mandate       disqualification         of   federal   judges,        it     neither\n\nprescribes nor prohibits any particular remedy for a violation of\n\nthat duty.\"       Id.\n\n               Here, even if we were to assume, without deciding, that\n\nJudge McAuliffe should have recused himself, we would not vacate\n\nthe district court's judgment now. The purely legal questions that\n\nJudge McAuliffe decided here called for no exercise of discretion\n\non his part and are subject to plenary review by this Court.                          In re\n\nSch.     Asbestos       Litig.,       977   F.2d    764,    787   (3rd       Cir.     1992)\n\n(characterizing failure to recuse as \"harmless error when a court\n\nof appeals will later review a ruling on a plenary basis\").                              As\n\n\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\fdiscussed above, our plenary review of Judge McAuliffe's denial of\n\nplaintiff's motion to dismiss revealed no error.\n\n          Under these circumstances, vacating the judgment and\n\nremanding this case for reconsideration by another district court\n\njudge would be unfair to the defendant and unduly burden the\n\ndistrict court without any benefit.   For those reasons, we decline\n\nto vacate the district court judgement based        on plaintiff's\n\nrecusal claim.\n\n          The grant of plaintiff's motion to dismiss and the denial\n\nof her motion for reconsideration are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f",
