Defendant-appellant       Gordon    Music,   Inc.\n\n(\"Gordon\") appeals from a judgment entered after a bench trial in\n\nfavor of plaintiff-appellee United Musical Instruments USA, Inc.\n\n(\"United\").       We affirm.\n\n            Only the briefest summary of the facts is warranted.                   In\n\n1998,    United,        a     manufacturer        and   distributor     of   musical\n\ninstruments, entered into a written agreement with Gordon, a seller\n\nand lessor of musical instruments, by which Gordon agreed to be a\n\nretail dealer of United's merchandise.                  All went well until 2000,\n\nwhen United began experiencing difficulty collecting amounts due\n\nfrom    Gordon.         Late      charges   accumulated,     the     possibility   of\n\nreturning merchandise for credit was unsuccessfully explored, sales\n\nto Gordon ceased, and the Gordon account was placed in collection.\n\n            In 2002, United filed a diversity action alleging breach\n\nof contract (Count 1), violation of the Massachusetts Commercial\n\nCode    (Count    2),       and   violation   of    the   Massachusetts      Consumer\n\nProtection Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (Count 3).                     Gordon raised\n\na chapter 93A counterclaim, which alleged that United's practice of\n\ngiving larger discounts than Gordon received to a competing retail\n\ndealer constituted an unfair and deceptive trade practice.                       At a\n\nbench trial, United's comptroller (Thomas Lawdenski), United's\n\nregional    sales       representative        (Joseph     Saravo),     and   Gordon's\n\npresident (Mark Gordon) testified.                      United also presented an\n\nextensive record of invoices (paid, unpaid, and partially paid),\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fshipping confirmations, credit memorandums, and payment records.\n\nThe presentation was rather one-sided; Mark Gordon admitted that\n\nGordon's relevant computer records had been automatically \"purged\"\n\nand testified that other relevant records (including such basic\n\nitems as cancelled checks) had been lost or discarded.          Gordon's\n\nbasic defenses were that the parties' contract did not satisfy the\n\nStatute of Frauds (no quantity of merchandise specified) and that\n\nGordon did not order or receive the disputed merchandise.           The\n\ncourt found in favor of United on counts one and two and awarded\n\njudgment in the amount of $259,148.16 (consisting of the amount of\n\nthe unpaid invoices, finance charges, and prejudgment interest).\n\nThe court rejected both sides' chapter 93A claims.\n\n            On appeal, Gordon claims that the district court made\n\nthree errors: (1) holding that recovery was not barred by the\n\nStatute of Frauds; (2) finding that the disputed goods and invoices\n\nwere actually sent by United and received by Gordon; and (3)\n\ndismissing Gordon's chapter 93A counterclaim.       In assessing the\n\nresults of a bench trial, we review the district court's findings\n\nof fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.          See\n\nRational Software Corp. v. Sterling Corp., 393 F.3d 276, 276 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n            We begin with the Statute of Frauds.   The district court\n\nconcluded     that   the   dealer   agreement,   confidential    dealer\n\ninformation memorandum, and the invoices collectively satisfied the\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fwriting   requirement.       Gordon    did        not   challenge     this     legal\n\nconclusion, even tangentially, until its reply brief.1                  This is too\n\nlate.     See    In   re   Gosselin,        276    F.3d   70,    72     (1st   Cir.\n\n2002)(arguments not raised in primary brief are waived).                       Thus,\n\nGordon's only surviving challenge to this holding is a factual one\n\n-- whether the invoices were actually sent and received -- which\n\nduplicates Gordon's second issue on appeal, which we address next.\n\n           Lawdenski and Saravo testified about how orders were\n\nprocessed, goods shipped, and invoices generated and sent. Saravo,\n\nwho had serviced the Gordon account, also testified that Gordon had\n\nnot complained about being billed for merchandise it had not\n\nordered   or   received.    As   noted      above,      United   also    presented\n\nabundant documentary evidence.         Significantly, the invoices that\n\nGordon had paid had been processed and documented in an identical\n\nmanner to the invoices Gordon did not pay.              Against this evidence,\n\nGordon offered little.      The district court expressed doubt about\n\nMark Gordon's credibility and specifically noted Gordon's \"sloppy\n\nand poor business practices.\" Mark Gordon also repeatedly conceded\n\nthat he could not tell if the disputed invoices were valid or not,\n\nand he undermined Gordon's contention that merchandise had not been\n\n\n1\n Gordon's arguments were primarily directed to the court's\nalternative holdings on the Statute of Frauds issue (e.g., whether\nthe dealer agreement could be considered a requirements contract\nand the effect of course of dealing). In light of the failure to\ncontest the court's primary holding, Gordon's presentation on the\nalternative holdings is irrelevant. Cf. In re Miles, 436 F.3d 291,\n294 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                      -4-\n\fdelivered with his testimony that he had sought to return a\n\nsignificant quantity of United's merchandise for credit.          On this\n\nrecord,   the   district   court's    finding   that   the   invoices   and\n\nmerchandise were sent by United and received by Gordon is not\n\nclearly erroneous.     Cf. Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Warwick Sewer\n\nAuth., 334 F.3d 161, 168 (1st Cir. 2003)(testimony that documents\n\nwere properly mailed with return addresses and not returned gives\n\nrise to presumption that documents were received).\n\n           Gordon's chapter 93A claim also merits little discussion.\n\nIn presenting this claim, Gordon focused on whether United had\n\nengaged in an unfair or deceptive practice in granting a competing\n\ndealer a larger discount. But, in addition to showing an unfair or\n\ndeceptive act, Gordon also had the burden of showing that it\n\nsustained a loss of tangible property or money as a result of the\n\nact.   See Arthur D. Little, Inc. v. Dooyang Corp., 147 F.3d 47, 56\n\n(1st Cir. 1998)(construing chapter 93A).         Since Gordon does not\n\nchallenge the district court's conclusion that it had failed to\n\nprove damages,2 Gordon could not prevail on this claim.         Cf. Eureka\n\nBroadband Corp. v. Wentworth Leasing Corp., 400 F.3d 62, 71 (1st\n\nCir. 2005)(failure to show damages defeats conversion claim).\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n2\n Nor could Gordon make such a challenge, as the only evidence on\nthis point in the record is Mark Gordon's concession on the witness\nstand that he could not prove any loss of any sort due to United's\nalleged wrongful conduct.\n\n                                     -5-\n\f",
