Espinosa on brief for petitioner.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Gina Walcott-\nTorres, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                          June 27, 2006\n\f            Per Curiam.      Cesar Augusto Estrada-Henao, a national of\n\nColombia, was detained on June 4, 2001, near Rio Grande City,\n\nTexas.    Removal proceedings were begun on the ground that he was in\n\nthe United States without having been lawfully admitted.                8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (2000).            Estrada applied for asylum and for\n\nwithholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158, 1231(b)(3)(A) and\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"), 1465 U.N.T.S. 85; see\n\nalso 8 C.F.R. § 208.18 (2006) (implementing the convention).\n\n            It is common knowledge, documented by State Department\n\nreports, that Colombia is a democracy but afflicted with violence\n\nfrom leftist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitary organizations.\n\nKidnapping, for political reasons and to raise money through\n\nransoms, is common. In his application for asylum and withholding,\n\nEstrada    claimed   that,    while    working    as   an   insurance    company\n\nrepresentative, he was kidnapped by such a group seeking financial\n\ninformation about wealthy clients, and thereafter ransomed by his\n\nfamily. He also said that after his departure from Colombia family\n\nmembers had reported threatening calls inquiring about Estrada.\n\n            The   immigration    judge       (\"IJ\"),   following   a    hearing,\n\nrejected Estrada's claims, saying that Estrada was not credible.\n\nThe IJ decision stressed Estrada's lack of any documentation (e.g.,\n\nproof that he had been employed by the insurance company) and\n\nvarious inconsistencies as between his asylum application and his\n\ntestimony (e.g., as to whether he had escaped or been kidnapped).\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fThe IJ found that Estrada had not established either a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution for his political views or a plausible threat\n\nof torture.       The Bureau of Immigration Appeals affirmed without\n\nopinion.\n\n            In this court, Estrada argues that the inconsistencies\n\nwere    minor,    that   lack    of    documentation    should     not   make    his\n\ntestimony incredible and that failure to show reasonable fear of\n\npolitical   persecution         does   not   preclude   a   showing      of   likely\n\ntorture.        Our review, directed to the IJ decision, Waweru v.\n\nGonzales, 437 F.3d 199, 203 (1st Cir. 2006), is de novo on\n\nquestions of law but deferential as to factual findings, including\n\ncredibility.       Singh v. Gonzales, 413 F.3d 156, 159-60 (1st Cir.\n\n2005); 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4) (2000 & U.S.C.A. 2005).\n\n            The inconsistencies or other oddities in the testimony\n\nwere not, taken together, trivial.              The most remarkable is that\n\nEstrada claimed in his testimony to have been threatened by right-\n\nwing groups before the kidnapping, did not mention the threats in\n\nhis    asylum    application     and    then   testified    that   he    had    been\n\nkidnapped by FARC or the like (FARC is the most notorious of the\n\nleft-wing groups).        There were further discrepancies between his\n\ntestimony and asylum application as to dates, whether he escaped or\n\nwas ransomed, and how he traveled to this country.\n\n            Making judgments as to credibility, difficult enough in\n\nordinary situations, is made even harder where some deviations\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f(e.g., between asylum applications and testimony) may result from\n\nthe conditions under which the information was elicited and where\n\ntranslation difficulties may account for discrepancies.                           But,\n\nhaving read the transcript of the hearing in this case, we conclude\n\nthat   the    IJ   did    not   act    irrationally      or   without    substantial\n\nevidence in refusing to believe Estrada's basic story. Settenda v.\n\nAshcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004) (substantial evidence\n\nstandard).\n\n              There      is     no    rule,      as    Estrada    suggests,        that\n\ninconsistencies be \"wildly\" inconsistent, nor does Nikijuluw v.\n\nGonzales, 427 F.3d 115 (1st Cir. 2005), so hold.                          Testimony,\n\ntogether      with    contextual       evidence,      comprises   a     mosaic;    its\n\nassessment depends upon a number of factors (such as expected\n\nprobability of events and their fit together) and clues (self-\n\ninterest, memory as to detail, self-contradiction) which even\n\nWigmore found difficult to reduce to a formula.\n\n              As for Estrada's lack of documentation, we agree with him\n\nthat it is not automatically fatal, 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a) (2006),\n\nbut    once   again      context      matters:        where   documentation       would\n\nnaturally be expected, its lack can count against the applicant.\n\nKheireddine v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 80, 88 (1st Cir. 2005).                     Here,\n\nthe absence of any materials bearing out Estrada's employment\n\nhistory or account of the kidnapping and ransom--considering that\n\nEstrada claimed to be in contact with his family--could rationally\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fbe given some weight by the IJ, whose experience in assessing\n\nasylum seeker stories, and the proof normally available, counts for\n\nsomething.\n\n          Finally, having rejected Estrada's claim for asylum as\n\nnot supported by credible testimony, the IJ gave short shrift to\n\nthe claim for withholding (which requires a stronger showing of\n\nlikely persecution1) and under CAT.    Estrada is right that under\n\nsome circumstances, a threat of torture under CAT could be made out\n\neven though some element of proof required for asylum was not.\n\nSettenda, 377 F.3d at 94.    But in this case, Estrada's claim to\n\nface any kind of threat upon returning to Colombia depended on the\n\ncredibility of his underlying story.\n\n          We have looked at the other decisions claimed by Estrada\n\nto be helpful to him.   These include Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34,\n\n39 (1st Cir. 1998), and Cometa v. INS, 34 Fed. App'x 316 (9th Cir.\n\n2002) (which is, regardless of reading, not binding on this court).\n\nThe cases are distinguishable; Gailius, for example, involved\n\ndeath-threat letters placed in the record.      Further discussion\n\nwould serve no purpose.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The reason the stronger showing sometimes matters--since the\nlesser showing will always be present where the greater one occurs-\n-is that the lesser one qualifies the asylum seeker for\ndiscretionary protection while the greater one entitles the\napplicant to protection.

Here, the absence of any materials bearing out Estrada's employment history or account of the kidnapping and ransom &#8212; considering that Estrada claimed to be in contact with his family &#8212; could rationally be given some weight by the IJ, whose experience in assessing asylum seeker stories, and the proof normally available, counts for something.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, having rejected Estrada's claim for asylum as not supported by credible testimony, the IJ gave short shrift to the claim for withholding (which requires a stronger showing of likely persecution<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>) and under CAT. Estrada is right that under some circumstances, a threat of torture under CAT could be made out even though some element of proof required for asylum was not. <i>Settenda,</i> 377 F.3d at 94. But in this case, Estrada's claim to face any kind of threat upon returning to Colombia depended on the credibility of his underlying story.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have looked at the other decisions claimed by Estrada to be helpful to him.

INS,</i> 34 Fed.Appx. 316 (9th Cir.2002) (which is, regardless of reading, not binding on this court). The cases are distinguishable; <i>Gailius,</i> for example, involved death-threat letters placed in the record.
