This appeal from a grant of summary judgment\n\nin a political discrimination case under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 raises\n\none procedural and one substantive issue.          The procedural issue\n\nconcerns the district court's decision to reject the plaintiffs'\n\nopposition to summary judgment as untimely, and the substantive\n\nissue concerns the district court's ultimate ruling that the\n\ndefendants were entitled to summary judgment.\n\n           The underlying dispute involves a decision by defendant\n\nMarcelo Trujillo-Panisse, the Mayor of the Municipality of Humacao,\n\nPuerto Rico, to terminate a lease with plaintiff Aida Moringlane-\n\nRuiz to house a Head Start program in a building that Moringlane\n\nowned.   The Mayor was a member of the Popular Democratic Party, and\n\nMoringlane was a member of the New Progressive Party.         Moringlane\n\nclaims that the decision to terminate her lease was motivated by\n\nthe Mayor's politically-based animus against her.\n\n           In June 2004, Moringlane, her spouse, and their conjugal\n\npartnership filed a complaint in federal district court against the\n\nMayor and Municipality alleging, inter alia, that the termination\n\nof the lease was impermissible discrimination in violation of the\n\nFirst Amendment.      In January 2005, the district court convened an\n\ninitial scheduling conference, during which the parties discussed\n\na   timetable   for   proceeding   with   the   litigation.   After   the\n\nconference, the district court entered a case management order\n\nwhich set the close of discovery on May 19, 2005, the filing of\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fsummary judgment motions on or before June 20, 2005, and the filing\n\nof oppositions to any such motions on or before July 20, 2005.\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b).\n\n              In accord with the prescribed deadlines, the defendants\n\nfiled their motion for summary judgment on June 20, 2005.                    Two days\n\nafter this filing, the plaintiffs' attorney moved to withdraw from\n\nthe case but did not ask to extend the July 20 deadline.                             The\n\ndistrict court did not rule on the withdrawal motion immediately,\n\nand the July 20 deadline passed without the plaintiffs having filed\n\nan opposition.         On August 9, 2005, the plaintiffs' new attorney\n\nfiled an appearance and asked for an additional forty-five days to\n\ncomplete discovery and oppose the motion for summary judgment. The\n\nmotion for an extension of the filing deadline was not immediately\n\nacted   on,     and    the    plaintiffs     filed     their     summary     judgment\n\nopposition on September 23, 2005, the last day for filing that they\n\nhad requested in their motion for an extension.                     On October 20,\n\n2005, the district court granted the first attorney's motion to\n\nwithdraw,      noted    the    appearance       of   new    counsel,     denied      the\n\nplaintiffs'     request       for    an   extension,       and   ruled   that     their\n\nopposition to the motion for summary judgment was untimely.                          The\n\ncourt   therefore      deemed       undisputed   the   facts      provided      by   the\n\ndefendants in support of their summary judgment motion.\n\n              The plaintiffs contend that the denial of their motion to\n\nextend the filing deadline was an abuse of discretion.                     They claim\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fthat, as of the date that their first attorney moved to withdraw,\n\nthey were unrepresented and that it was unfair to hold them to a\n\nfiling deadline that arose while they were without counsel.\n\n               The     district       court    \"has    significant      discretionary\n\nauthority to set and enforce filing deadlines in accordance with\n\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, even when those deadlines are\n\ndifficult for lawyers to meet.\"                 Perez-Cordero v. Wal-Mart P.R.,\n\n440    F.3d    531,     533   (1st     Cir.    2006).        This   discretion    is   a\n\nrecognition          that    district     courts      are    responsible    for      case\n\nmanagement and \"must often be firm in managing crowded dockets and\n\ndemanding adherence to announced deadlines.\"                         Mendez v. Banco\n\nPopular de P.R., 900 F.2d 4, 7 (1st Cir. 1990).                       Indeed, we have\n\nrarely overturned the denial of a motion for an extension of a\n\nfiling deadline and have done so only where the appellant has\n\ndemonstrated that she was justifiably surprised by the court's\n\naction or where the individual circumstances make the denial\n\nunfair.       Perez-Cordero, 440 F.3d at 534.\n\n               In light of this standard, the plaintiffs' assertion that\n\ntheir attorney's request to withdraw entitled them to an extension\n\nof the filing deadline lacks merit.                 The plaintiffs did not ask for\n\nan    extension       when    their    lawyer       withdrew.       According   to    the\n\nplaintiffs, included in their lawyer's motion to withdraw was an\n\n\"implicit\" request for an extension.                        This argument gains no\n\ntraction in the face of our clear admonition that \"a party's\n\n\n                                              -4-\n\fdecision to discharge one lawyer and retain another does not serve\n\nas a free pass to ignore court-appointed deadlines.\"             Velez v.\n\nAwning Windows, Inc., 375 F.3d 35, 41 (1st Cir. 2004).         \"Judges are\n\nnot expected to be mindreaders,\" Schneider v. Local 103 I.B.E.W.\n\nHealth Plan, 442 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2006) (citation omitted), and\n\ntherefore, it was incumbent upon the plaintiffs to seek more time\n\nif they needed it, see Velez, 375 F.3d at 41 (\"A party who seeks to\n\nbe relieved from a court-appointed deadline has an obligation, at\n\na bare minimum, to present his arguments for relief to the ordering\n\ncourt.\").\n\n            The plaintiffs explicitly requested an extension of the\n\nfiling deadline on August 9, more than two weeks after the filing\n\ndeadline had passed.        Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(2), a party\n\nseeking   to   extend   a   deadline   that   has   already   passed   must\n\ndemonstrate excusable neglect for not seeking an extension before\n\nthe deadline's expiration.      In moving for the extension on August\n\n9, the plaintiffs did not present a claim of excusable neglect.\n\nSee Bromsted v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am., 421 F.3d 459, 464 (7th\n\nCir. 2005) (affirming the denial of a post-deadline motion for an\n\nextension of time because the moving party did not argue that his\n\nneglect was excusable).       Indeed, they have not done so even on\n\nappeal.   The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion\n\nin denying the plaintiffs' request for an extension of time to\n\noppose the defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f                Where a party fails to file a timely opposition to an\n\nadversary's summary judgment motion, the district court, as it did\n\nhere, may take as uncontested the evidence submitted with the\n\nmotion.     Perez-Cordero, 440 F.3d at 533-34.             Nevertheless, the\n\nmoving party's motion must still be scrutinized under Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 56.    Id. at 534.     The district court did so and concluded that\n\nthe defendants were entitled to summary judgment because there was\n\nundisputed evidence that the defendants cancelled the plaintiffs'\n\nlease for a non-discriminatory reason.            We review this ruling de\n\nnovo.     See Wolinetz v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., 361 F.3d 44, 47\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n\n               The undisputed facts are as follows.        In July 1997, the\n\nMunicipality signed a lease with Moringlane to rent property from\n\nher to house a Head Start school.               After signing the lease,\n\nMoringlane placed a fence in the back of the building that limited\n\nthe outdoor space available to the children.\n\n               From 1998 through 2001, the Municipality renewed the\n\nlease.     When Mayor Trujillo assumed office in January 2001, the\n\nMunicipality had already begun to search for another property to\n\nhouse    the    school   because   of    the   lack   of   outdoor   space   at\n\nMoringlane's property.\n\n               In June 2001, the Municipality extended Moringlane's\n\ncontract for six months but told her that it was looking to move\n\nthe school.       The Municipality nevertheless extended Moringlane's\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\flease because it was unable to locate a suitable alternative site.\n\nIn    the   meantime,     the   Municipality    learned     that   Moringlane's\n\nproperty suffered from several health and safety problems in\n\naddition to the lack of adequate outdoor space.                On May 27, 2003,\n\nMayor Trujillo signed a letter stating that the lease would be\n\nterminated.\n\n              A   defendant     is   entitled   to   summary    judgment   on   a\n\npolitical discrimination claim when the undisputed facts establish\n\na    legitimate,    non-discriminatory        explanation    for   the   adverse\n\ndecision.      See Aguiar-Carrasquillo v. Agosto-Alicea, 445 F.3d 19,\n\n26-27 (1st Cir. 2006).           The undisputed facts establish that the\n\ndefendants ended their lease with Moringlane because her property\n\nwas not a suitable site for housing a Head Start school due to\n\nhealth and safety problems and the lack of outdoor space.                    The\n\nplaintiffs allude to evidence that they contend supports their\n\nclaim that political discrimination was the real reason for the\n\ndefendants' decision to end the lease, but none of this evidence is\n\nproperly before us because the plaintiffs failed to timely oppose\n\nthe defendants' motion for summary judgment. As is often true, the\n\nplaintiffs' \"failure to oppose summary judgment is fatal to [their]\n\ncase.\"      Perez-Cordero, 440 F.3d at 534.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f",

Indeed, they have not done so even on\n\nappeal.   The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion\n\nin denying the plaintiffs' request for an extension of time to\n\noppose the defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f                Where a party fails to file a timely opposition to an\n\nadversary's summary judgment motion, the district court, as it did\n\nhere, may take as uncontested the evidence submitted with the\n\nmotion.

The district court did so and concluded that\n\nthe defendants were entitled to summary judgment because there was\n\nundisputed evidence that the defendants cancelled the plaintiffs'\n\nlease for a non-discriminatory reason.            We review this ruling de\n\nnovo.     See Wolinetz v. Berkshire Life Ins.

In July 1997, the\n\nMunicipality signed a lease with Moringlane to rent property from\n\nher to house a Head Start school.               After signing the lease,\n\nMoringlane placed a fence in the back of the building that limited\n\nthe outdoor space available to the children.\n\n               From 1998 through 2001, the Municipality renewed the\n\nlease.     When Mayor Trujillo assumed office in January 2001, the\n\nMunicipality had already begun to search for another property to\n\nhouse    the    school   because   of    the   lack   of   outdoor   space   at\n\nMoringlane's property.\n\n               In June 2001, the Municipality extended Moringlane's\n\ncontract for six months but told her that it was looking to move\n\nthe school.       The Municipality nevertheless extended Moringlane's\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\flease because it was unable to locate a suitable alternative site.\n\nIn    the   meantime,     the   Municipality    learned     that   Moringlane's\n\nproperty suffered from several health and safety problems in\n\naddition to the lack of adequate outdoor space.                On May 27, 2003,\n\nMayor Trujillo signed a letter stating that the lease would be\n\nterminated.\n\n              A   defendant     is   entitled   to   summary    judgment   on   a\n\npolitical discrimination claim when the undisputed facts establish\n\na    legitimate,    non-discriminatory        explanation    for   the   adverse\n\ndecision.

Agosto-Alicea, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202153\"><a href=\"/opinion/202153/aguiar-carrasquillo-v-agosto-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n26-27 (1st Cir. 2006).           The undisputed facts establish that the\n\ndefendants ended their lease with Moringlane because her property\n\nwas not a suitable site for housing a Head Start school due to\n\nhealth and safety problems and the lack of outdoor space.                    The\n\nplaintiffs allude to evidence that they contend supports their\n\nclaim that political discrimination was the real reason for the\n\ndefendants' decision to end the lease, but none of this evidence is\n\nproperly before us because the plaintiffs failed to timely oppose\n\nthe defendants' motion for summary judgment.
