R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 04-2125\n\n                             UNITED STATES,\n\n                                Appellee,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                             DAVID SANFORD,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                     FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n        [Hon. John A. Woodcock, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                    Torruella, Selya and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Barry S. Pollack, Jill Brenner Meixel and Donnelly, Conroy &\nGelhaar, LLP, on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, and Paula D. Silsby,\nUnited States Attorney, on Motion for Summary Disposition for\nappellee.\n\n\n                          December 28, 2005\n\f     Per Curiam.     Pursuant to a plea agreement, appellant, David\n\nSanford, Jr., pleaded guilty to conspiracy to interfere with\n\ncommerce by robbery, possession of a stolen firearm, felon in\n\npossession of a firearm, and possession of a controlled substance\n\nwith intent to distribute.     He now challenges both his conviction\n\nand sentence.\n\n     Appellant's primary argument is that his guilty plea was\n\ninvoluntary because he ingested three medications for depression\n\nand psychosis on the morning he entered his plea.     This claim has\n\nbeen raised for the first time on appeal, so we review for plain\n\nerror.   See   United States v. Serrano-Beavaix, 400 F.3d 50, 53 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).     As the district judge was made aware of appellant's\n\ningestion during the hearing, the judge was obligated to conduct a\n\nmore searching inquiry into the contemporaneous effects of the\n\nmedication on his ability to render a knowing and intelligent plea.\n\nMiranda-Gonzalez v. United States, 181 F.3d 164, 166 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).   The district judge satisfied his duty: he asked appellant\n\non four separate occasions whether he understood the nature of the\n\nproceedings, and each time appellant assured the court of his\n\nability to comprehend the proceedings.      Appellant also appeared\n\nlucid, confirming his own assurances of competency.     Accordingly,\n\nthe involuntariness claim fails.\n\n     For the same reasons, we find no impediment to concluding that\n\nappellant effectively waived his appellate rights during the Rule\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f11 colloquy.       After reviewing the Rule 11 transcript in its\n\nentirety, we conclude that the district judge took pains to explain\n\nthat his right to appeal is circumscribed by his plea agreement,\n\nwhich includes a waiver of appeal provision clearly providing that-\n\n-subject to an exception discussed below--appellant waives his\n\nright   to   appeal   or   to   challenge   his   conviction   and   sentence\n\ncollaterally.     See United States v. Teeter,         257 F.3d 14, 25-26\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).      We see no miscarriage of justice in enforcing the\n\nprovision.\n\n     However, we will assume, without deciding, that the exception\n\nto the appeal waiver provision renders the waiver inapplicable to\n\nappellant's claims pursuant to United States v. Booker, 543 U.S.\n\n220 (2005) and pursuant to Shepard v. United States, 125 S. Ct.\n\n1254 (2005).    See United States v. Taylor, 413 F.3d 1146, 1151-52\n\n(10th Cir. 2005) (construing a similarly worded exception to an\n\nappeal waiver to permit a direct appeal on Booker grounds).             Even\n\non that assumption, the appellant does not profit.\n\n     As to the Booker claim, appellant argues that the appropriate\n\nstandard of review is harmless error.         We disagree.     Although the\n\nsentencing judge sua sponte concluded that Blakely v. Washington,\n\n542 U.S. 296 (2004), was inapplicable to appellant's sentence,\n\nappellant neither objected to the judge's conclusion, claimed that\n\nthe guidelines were unconstitutional, nor otherwise raised any\n\nerror under Blakely or Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fThus, the error was not preserved.              See United States v. Martins,\n\n413 F.3d 139, 153 (1st Cir. 2005).             Accordingly, we apply the plain\n\nerror standard of United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75\n\n(1st   Cir.     2005),     which       requires       appellant    to      \"point     to\n\ncircumstances creating a reasonable probability that the district\n\ncourt would impose a different sentence more favorable to the\n\ndefendant     under      the    'advisory       Guidelines'       Booker     regime.\"\n\nAppellant's      primary       claim    is     that    there     exist     mitigating\n\ncircumstances that the mandatory guidelines either prohibited or\n\ndiscouraged the sentencing judge from considering when he devised\n\nthe sentence.      In particular, appellant points to the numerous\n\nsympathetic circumstances he described in his sentencing hearing\n\nallocution.     He does not bother in his brief, however, to explain\n\nhow the guidelines minimized the impact of each (or any) of these\n\ncircumstances. Upon review of the guidelines, it is apparent that,\n\nat most, a small fraction of these circumstances were prohibited\n\nfrom consideration for downward departure and may have led the\n\njudge to feel that he could not fully consider them when sentencing\n\nwithin the guidelines range.             This attenuated possibility surely\n\ndoes not establish a reasonable probability in light of the judge's\n\ncomments during sentencing.            The sentencing judge stated that \"the\n\n20-year sentence, as harsh as it is, is necessary to protect\n\nsociety   and    other     people      from   you     and   to   protect    you     from\n\nyourself.\"      The judge's clear satisfaction with the sentence and\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fthe fact that he selected a point in the middle of the range are\n\nsufficient   to    enable   us   to   conclude   that   appellant     has   not\n\nsustained his burden. See, e.g., United States v. Baskin, 424 F.3d\n\n1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2005).     For the same reasons, we are not persuaded\n\nby appellant's argument that the judge would on remand more fully\n\nconsider that appellant's codefendant, who played a more crucial\n\nrole in the crime, received a less substantial sentence.\n\n     As to appellant's Shepard claim, he argues that the district\n\ncourt erred when, at sentencing, it relied on incompetent evidence\n\nof prior offenses.     Even assuming that the Shepard claim survived\n\nthe waiver of appellate rights provision in the plea agreement, it\n\nis nevertheless waived for different reasons. Appellant stipulated\n\nelsewhere in his plea agreement to the fact that he was an armed\n\ncareer criminal.      Though Shepard articulated a new rule for the\n\nmanner in which judges can conclude that a defendant has armed\n\ncareer   criminal    status,     appellant   accepted    the   risk   that   a\n\nfavorable change in the law would occur after he entered his plea.\n\nSee United States v. Sahlin, 399 F.3d 27, 31-32 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nIn addition, he raised an initial objection as to the factual\n\npredicates for the armed career criminal enhancement and later\n\nwithdrew it.      Lastly, he failed to object to any of the judge's\n\nfact-finding in connection with the latter's conclusion that the\n\narmed career criminal enhancement applied.              Accordingly, he has\n\nwaived his Shepard claim.        See Sahlin, 399 F.3d at 31-32; United\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fStates v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n     Lastly,    appellant     maintains     that    \"[t]he      record   reflects\n\ninadequate     access   between     [him]     and    his     trial      attorney.\"\n\nGenerally,   claims     of   ineffective     assistance      of   counsel       must\n\noriginally be presented to the district court as a collateral\n\nattack under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2255.       United States v. Colon-Torres, 382\n\nF.3d 76, 84 (1st Cir. 2004).              As the record in this case is\n\ninsufficiently    developed,      this    case     does   not    fall    into   the\n\nexception to the general rule.           See id.\n\n     Accordingly, we grant the government's motion for summary\n\ndisposition.     See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).             We therefore affirm the\n\nconviction and sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f",
