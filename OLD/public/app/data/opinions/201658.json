This is a dispute between an\n\ninsurance company--Commercial Union Insurance Company (\"Commercial\n\nUnion\")--and one of its reinsurers, Swiss Reinsurance America\n\nCorporation (\"Swiss Re\").    The principal issue is whether, under\n\nseveral three-year reinsurance policies, Swiss Re was protected by\n\na single per-occurrence limit on its liability for the three-year\n\npolicy period or whether the limit applies separately for each\n\npolicy year, thereby enlarging Swiss Re's total exposure.\n\n          The background events involve three different tiers of\n\ninsurance, coverage periods that do not precisely overlap between\n\ntiers, and pertinent clauses that are not even identical from one\n\npolicy to its successor.    Accordingly, in setting the stage, some\n\noversimplification as to the policies and some postponement of\n\ndetail are both necessary.    We begin at the ground floor with the\n\ninsured, W.R. Grace & Co. (\"Grace\"), a well-known company with many\n\ndifferent facilities at different locations, and then work up\n\nthrough the tiers.\n\n          As to the sites at issue in this case, Grace's primary\n\ninsurer during the period in question (roughly 1962 to 1974) was\n\nMaryland Casualty Co. (“Maryland”). With a one-year exception that\n\nis not important to our case, that company provided coverage to\n\nGrace under five successive one-year policies between June 30,\n\n1962, and June 30, 1967, and two three-year policies from June 30,\n\n1967, to June 30, 1973.    The policies covered personal injury and\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fproperty damage up to $1 million per occurrence but with much lower\n\nlimits     ($25,000,    later   $100,000)   for   losses   from   \"gradual\n\npollution.\"\n\n            Between October 20, 1962, and June 30, 1974, Commercial\n\nUnion's predecessors in interest provided excess liability coverage\n\nto Grace--that is, coverage starting at the point that the Maryland\n\npolicies left off--in the form of four successive multi-year\n\numbrella policies. (The first, second and fourth policies each ran\n\nfor three years; the third ran for about two years and eight\n\nmonths.)     The policies provided coverage in the amount of $5\n\nmillion for each \"occurrence,\" defining \"occurrence\" to include “an\n\nevent, or continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which\n\nunexpectedly results in personal injury [or] property damage”\n\nduring the policy period, and continued:\n\n            [A]ll personal injury and property damage . .\n            . arising out of one event or continuous or\n            repeated exposure to substantially the same\n            general conditions existing at or emanating\n            from one premises location shall be deemed to\n            be one occurrence.\n\n            The Commercial Union policies also included clauses,\n\nknown as \"follow-the-form\" clauses, that are designed to make\n\ncoverage under a higher-tier policy (here, Commercial Union's)\n\nconform--subject       to   certain   qualifications--to   the    coverage\n\nprovided by the underlying policy (here, Maryland’s policies). See\n\n2 Ostrager & Newman, Handbook on Insurance Coverage Disputes §\n\n13.01[a], at 868 (12th ed. 2004).       Thus, in the first two policies,\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthe follow-the-form language provided that \"the terms, conditions\n\nand limitations of this policy will not be construed any more\n\nrestrictive [sic] than the terms, conditions and limitations of\n\nUnderlying Insurance.”            The latter two provided:\n\n              [s]uch coverage as is afforded by this policy\n              shall apply to occurrences covered by the\n              terms and conditions of [the underlying\n              policy] or by the terms of conditions of this\n              policy except that the definition of Property\n              Damage as contained in this policy shall\n              apply.\n\n              The top tier of coverage in this case was provided by\n\nSwiss Re, which offered not insurance for Grace but \"reinsurance\"\n\nto Commercial Union.          Swiss Re agreed, under specified conditions,\n\nto indemnify Commercial Union for specified losses it might suffer\n\nunder its excess insurance policies. The form of reinsurance used,\n\ncalled      \"facultative,\"        covers   risks     that   the   \"cedent\"      (here,\n\nCommercial Union) bears under a specific policy or policies.                        2\n\nOstrager & Newman, supra, § 15.03[a], at 996-97.\n\n              Swiss     Re   issued   three      multi-year   \"certificates\"       to\n\nCommercial Union, corresponding to each of the last three (out of\n\na   total    of   four)      multi-year     excess    liability     policies     that\n\nCommercial Union had written for Grace, i.e., roughly for the\n\nperiod 1965 to 1974.              Each Swiss Re certificate was skeletal,\n\nidentifying       the   Commercial     Union      excess    liability     policy   in\n\nquestion and agreeing to share a specified portion of Commercial\n\nUnion's      liability       to   Grace.     Specifically,        under   the   first\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fcertificate Swiss Re agreed to share 50 percent of Commercial\n\nUnion's first $1 million in loss for \"each occurrence\"; under the\n\nsecond, 50 percent of the first $500,000; under the third, 37.5\n\npercent of the first $500,000.\n\n            Each certificate contained on the back side several\n\nstandard conditions.      These included variously phrased follow-the-\n\nform   clauses   saying       that--except      as   “otherwise     specifically\n\nprovided” in the certificate--Swiss Re’s liability would “follow”\n\nor “be subject” to the “terms and conditions” of Commercial Union’s\n\npolicies.     Thus,     through      follow-the-form    clauses,     Swiss   Re's\n\npolicies looked back to Commercial Union's, and the latter's\n\npolicies looked back to Maryland's policies with Grace.\n\n            In addition, the Swiss Re certificates contained \"follow-\n\nthe-fortunes\"     provisions,         which--where      the   case      involves\n\nsettlements--are sometimes called “follow-the-settlements” clauses.\n\nSuch provisions are designed to give the cedent reasonable latitude\n\nto settle claims against it by the primary insured and to bind the\n\nreinsurer (in some measure) from contesting the extent of the\n\ncedent's    liability    to    the    primary   insured.      See    Ostrager   &\n\nVyskocil, Modern Reinsurance Law & Practice §§ 9.01-.02 (1996);\n\nTravelers Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of\n\nLondon, 760 N.E.2d 319, 328 (N.Y. 2001).               Here, the follow-the-\n\nfortunes clause in each certificate reads as follows:\n\n            All claims involving this reinsurance, when\n            settled by [Commercial Union], shall be\n\n                                        -5-\n\f            binding on [Swiss Re], which shall be bound to\n            pay its proportion of such settlements\n            promptly following receipt of proof of loss.\n\n            In the 1980s, Grace began to notify Commercial Union of\n\npotential property damage losses due to hazardous waste pollution\n\nat various Grace sites.      In 1988, Maryland filed a declaratory\n\njudgment action in federal district court in New York against Grace\n\nseeking   to   clarify   Maryland's   obligations   under   its   primary\n\npolicies.   See Md. Cas. Co. v. Cont’l Cas. Co., 332 F.3d 145, 148-\n\n49 (2d Cir. 2003).   Commercial Union and other insurers were added\n\nto the suit, and eventually the case expanded to involve over 200\n\nwaste sites.\n\n            In October 1998, Commercial Union settled with Grace\n\nbased on information about nine “focus” waste sites (out of the\n\nforty for which Grace claimed Commercial Union was liable), for a\n\nsingle immediate payment of $57.6 million.          The settlement was\n\npremised on estimates of projected liability over a substantial\n\nperiod due to damage at each site and on certain assumptions.         Two\n\nsuch assumptions were (1) that the hazardous waste liability at\n\neach site should be allocated pro rata across the years of relevant\n\ninsurance coverage at each site and (2) that the $5 million per-\n\noccurrence limit in each policy should be viewed as applying\n\nseparately to each policy year, i.e., $15 million for a three-year\n\npolicy.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f            When Commercial Union then sought indemnity from Swiss Re\n\nfor $13.7 million (out of the $57.6 million paid to Grace), Swiss\n\nRe paid less than half that amount.               It withheld part of the\n\nbalance (about $6 million) on the ground that its reinsurance\n\ncertificates     protected    it   from    any   calculation    of    Commercial\n\nUnion's liability to Grace, or Swiss Re's to Commercial Union,\n\npremised on the notion that the per-occurrence limit applied\n\nseparately to each policy year (as opposed to the entire multi-year\n\npolicy period).      Swiss Re also disputed another aspect of the\n\ndemand but that issue was apparently settled.\n\n            On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court\n\nconcluded that Swiss Re was correct on the \"annualization\" issue.\n\nThe court held that Swiss Re's liability should be based on the\n\npremise that the per-occurrence limit applied once to a continuing\n\nleakage at a site over the multi-year policy period and not once\n\nfor each year of the period.              The court deemed this to be an\n\nexplicit limit in each certificate, overriding any follow-the-form\n\nor follow-the-fortunes provision.            This appeal by Commercial Union\n\nfollowed.\n\n            We   review   a    grant      of   summary    judgment    de   novo.\n\nCommercial Union Ins. Co. v. Walbrook Ins. Co., 7 F.3d 1047, 1050\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).     The present contract-interpretation dispute is\n\ngoverned    either   by      the   substantive      law    of   New    York   or\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fMassachusetts.1    Further, interpretation of an insurance contract\n\nis--at least absent extrinsic evidence--a question of law for the\n\ncourt.     See Fishman v. LaSalle Nat’l Bank, 247 F.3d 300, 303 n.2\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).      Accord Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. Offices\n\nUnlimited, Inc., 645 N.E.2d 1165, 1168 (Mass. 1995); Sutton v. E.\n\nRiver Sav. Bank, 435 N.E.2d 1075, 1077-78 (N.Y. 1982).\n\n            In a dispute between insurers and reinsurers, certain\n\ncanons of construction that protect purchasers of direct insurance\n\npolicies do not apply.   Unigard Sec. Ins. Co. v. N. River Ins. Co.,\n\n4 F.3d 1049, 1065 (2d Cir. 1993); Boston Ins. Co. v. Fawcett, 258\n\nN.E.2d 771, 776 (Mass. 1970).      Both New York and Massachusetts\n\nauthorities recognize the operation of follow-the-form and follow-\n\nthe-fortunes clauses.      See Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Seven\n\nProvinces Ins. Co., 217 F.3d 33, 42 (1st Cir. 2000), cert. denied\n\n531 U.S. 1146 (2001); Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Home Ins. Co., 882\n\nF. Supp. 1328, 1337, 1345-46 (S.D.N.Y. 1995); Metro. Leasing, Inc.,\n\nv. Pac. Employers Ins. Co., 633 N.E.2d 434, 439 & n.6 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. 1994).     Against this background we turn to the merits of the\n\ndispute.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The district court determined that the substantive law of\neither Massachusetts or New York governed the dispute, and that the\ntwo did not differ in any pertinent respect. The parties do not\ndispute this assessment and, the approach being colorable, we\nfollow suit. See Royal Bus. Group, Inc. v. Realist, Inc., 933 F.2d\n1056, 1064 (1st Cir. 1991); see also Lexington Ins. Co. v. Gen.\nAccident Ins. Co. of Am., 338 F.3d 42, 46 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                 -8-\n\f           A good deal about this case, in addition to the ill-\n\nworded policies    and    certificates    themselves,   remains     obscure.\n\nOrdinarily, courts construe policy language in relation to specific\n\nfacts,   the   policy    language   drawing   meaning   in   part    through\n\ninteraction with a given fact pattern.          Here, by contrast, the\n\nbriefs tell us very little about what went wrong at any site,\n\nalthough the record modestly describes the actual conditions that\n\ngave rise to liability.2     Seemingly the conditions varied.\n\n           On Swiss Re's view of the matter, the leakage at any one\n\nsite during the three-year period covered by its certificate\n\ncomprised a single \"occurrence.\"          The term \"occurrence\" is not\n\ndefined in the Swiss Re certificates but one plausible reading of\n\nthe term would treat the entire continuous leakage as a single,\n\nalbeit drawn out, occurrence; and, for such a reading Swiss Re can\n\npoint to the definition of \"occurrence\" in the Commercial Union\n\npolicies quoted above--namely, that continuous exposure to the same\n\ncondition \"shall be deemed to be one occurrence.\"\n\n           If the leakage during the three-year period comprised one\n\noccurrence, then Commercial Union's liability to Grace for a three-\n\nyear leak would be capped at $5 million and Swiss Re's liability to\n\n\n     2\n      These   included   landfills,   leaking   chemical   drums,\ncontaminated lagoons and asbestos-contaminated soil, abandoned\ndrums of industrial waste and leaking storage tanks, plant\noperations that involved ammonia wastewater being disposed of in\nunlined pits or injected directly into the ground, improper\ndisposal of pesticide residue, inadvertent spreading of dry waste\nparticles, and buried radioactive rubble.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fCommercial Union would be $500,000 (50 percent of the first $1\n\nmillion).         By contrast, if leakage during each year in the three-\n\nyear       period   were    treated     as    a     separate      occurrence,       or   (put\n\ndifferently) the cap applied year by year, Swiss Re could be liable\n\nfor $1.5 million ($500,000 times three). The settlement with Grace\n\nassumed the latter view of the matter.\n\n                 If the question were considered as a mechanical exercise\n\nin   language--without            the   aid   of       “follow”    clauses     or    policy\n\narguments--Swiss Re might well have the stronger argument, just as\n\nthe district court found.               The policy period is three years, the\n\ncontinuous release of the one pollutant at one site can easily be\n\ndescribed as one occurrence.              So Swiss Re could be seen as merely\n\ninsisting--in reliance on its own certificate's \"per occurrence\"\n\nlanguage--on        a     cap    of   $500,000      in    reinsurance    for    a    single\n\noccurrence.\n\n                 A number of cases construing multi-year policies, and\n\napplying varying language to different factual scenarios, have\n\nconstrued caps in the fashion urged by Swiss Re and have rejected\n\n\"annualization\" glosses of the kind pressed by Commercial Union.3\n\nOnly       New   Jersey    has    suggested       an     annualization   approach         may\n\n\n\n       3\n      See, e.g., Soc'y of Roman Catholic Church of Diocese of\nLafayette & Lake Charles, Inc. v. Interstate Fire & Cas. Co., 26\nF.3d 1359, 1366 (5th Cir. 1994); Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ill. v.\nIns. Corp. of Ire., Ltd., 750 F. Supp. 1375, 1376, 1380-81 (N.D.\nIll. 1990); Hercules, Inc. v. AIU Ins. Co., 784 A.2d 481, 495-96\n(Del. 2001).\n\n                                             -10-\n\fnormally apply.        See, e.g., Benjamin Moore & Co. v. Aetna Cas. &\n\nSur. Co., 843 A.2d 1094, 1103 (N.J. 2004); Owens-Illinois, Inc. v.\n\nUnited Ins. Co., 650 A.2d 974, 995 (N.J. 1994).              But for the most\n\npart the “majority view” cases did not implicate follow-the-form\n\nand    follow-the-settlement      clauses,     and   those   clauses     make   a\n\ndifference in our case.\n\n             Let us start with Commercial Union’s liability to Grace.\n\nCommercial     Union’s    own   policies     contained   language   in    their\n\ndefinition of occurrence quoted above, hostile to annualization.\n\nYet the multi-year Maryland policies explicitly provided for their\n\nper occurrence limits to apply on an annual basis, as did the\n\nearlier one-year policies.        So Grace could argue in any litigation\n\nwith Commercial Union that the latter's obligations were governed\n\nby    the   former's   policy   given   that    Commercial    Union's    excess\n\ninsurance policies contained a strong follow-the-form clause of its\n\nown.\n\n             Specifically,      the     follow-the-form       provisions        in\n\nCommercial Union’s excess liability policies state (in one form)\n\nthat the excess policy is no more restrictive than the Maryland\n\npolicy and (in the other) that Commercial Union would cover any\n\noccurrences covered by the Maryland policy. Thus in Hatco Corp. v.\n\nW.R. Grace & Co., 801 F. Supp. 1334, 1354-55 (D.N.J. 1992), the\n\ncourt held that a particular exclusion in Commercial Union’s policy\n\nwas overridden by the follow-form provision as construed in favor\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fthe insured.   So, although New Jersey law has no application here,\n\narguably Commercial Union’s policy language should be read to\n\ndovetail with Maryland’s policy, i.e., by applying the caps on the\n\nsame annualized basis.4\n\n          Commercial Union’s outside coverage counsel conducted a\n\nstudy of its excess liability policies and pertinent case law,\n\nreaching various tentative conclusions (at times concluding that\n\nannualization was unlikely, and at other times concluding that\n\nvariations in language made annualization likely under some of\n\nCommercial Union’s policies but not under others).     In the end,\n\ncounsel concluded in a settlement analysis and recommendation that\n\nannualization was a likely outcome in the then-ongoing New York law\n\nsuit between the parties.\n\n          Whether this view of Commercial Union’s liability to\n\nGrace is correct or not, it is binding upon Swiss Re under its\n\nfollow-the-fortunes clause so long as the settlement was reasonable\n\nand made in good faith.

But each Commercial Union policy as a whole\n\nincludes not only its own anti-annualization language but its own\n\nfollow-the-form clause, seemingly invoking the pro-annualization\n\nlanguage of the underlying Maryland policy.            Further, the insured\n\nwould benefit from the usual canons of interpretation favoring the\n\npolicy holder.\n\n          This brings us to Swiss Re’s liability to Commercial\n\nUnion under the terms of the reinsurance certificates.               Even if\n\nCommercial Union were deemed liable to Grace, Commercial Union's\n\nright to the indemnity from Swiss Re is only for a specified share\n\nof Commercial Union's liability (e.g., 50 percent of the first $1\n\nmillion) for \"each occurrence.\" The \"occurrence\" language delimits\n\nSwiss Re's liability; the question is what the \"each occurrence\"\n\nlanguage means.\n\n          The district court read the phrase as if it meant, for a\n\nmulti-year leak, that the leak was a single occurrence for the\n\nentire policy period so that the $500,000 cap applied once for the\n\npolicy period.      This is a defensible reading, as the cases cited\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fabove show, but one could also call the continuing leak a new\n\noccurrence every day or every drop.           Or one could, as New Jersey\n\nseemingly does, adopt a prudential compromise reading that treated\n\nit as an occurrence for each year regardless of policy period.\n\n              The   Swiss   Re    certificates     could    have   contained   a\n\ndefinition     of   \"occurrence\"     in   relation    to    continuing    leaks,\n\nexpressly negating annualization, but Swiss Re chose to provide no\n\ndefinition at all for this malleable word.             Of course, one could\n\nread    the   Swiss   Re    policy   as   adopting    the    Commercial   Union\n\ndefinition of the term via Swiss Re’s follow-the-form clauses--but\n\nwhich    Commercial     Union’s      definition?       The    explicit     anti-\n\nannualization reading based on the occurrence definition or the\n\npro-annualization follow-the-form version drawing on the Maryland\n\npolicies' annualization provisions?\n\n              Here, Commercial Union’s liability to Grace has been\n\nestablished by a seemingly reasonable settlement made (so far as we\n\nknow) in good faith.             Under Swiss Re’s follow-the-settlements\n\nclause it is bound to accept this pro-annualization reading of the\n\nCommercial Union policy for purposes of establishing Commercial\n\nUnion’s liability to Grace.          In our view, Swiss Re’s follow-the-\n\nform clause should be deemed to extend this reading into the\n\nparallel language in Swiss Re's own certificates subject only to\n\nany clear limitation to the contrary in the Swiss Re documents.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\f           This   view   of     the     matter    accords     with   the   basic\n\npresumption of concurrence that we think exists where there is a\n\nskeleton reinsurance contract coupled with follow-the-form and\n\nfollow-the-settlements clauses.           According to a New York case,\n\nconsistent with other authorities,\n\n           [w]here a following form clause is found in\n           the reinsurance contract, concurrency between\n           the policy of reinsurance and the reinsured\n           policy is presumed, such that a policy of\n           reinsurance will be construed as offering the\n           same terms, conditions and scope of coverage\n           as exist in the reinsured policy, i.e., in the\n           absence of explicit language in the policy of\n           reinsurance to the contrary.\n\nAetna, 882 F. Supp. at 1337.          Accord Ostrager & Vyskocil, supra, §\n\n2.03[a], at 2-9.    Indeed, concurrence advances one of the basic\n\npurposes of reinsurance, which is “[s]preading” risk to prevent “a\n\ncatastrophic loss from falling upon one insurer.”              Unigard, 4 F.3d\n\nat 1053.\n\n           Of course, if sufficiently clear, specific limits in the\n\ncertificate   control    over   the     general    aim   of   concurrence    and\n\nordinary \"follow\" clauses.6       Unfortunately for Swiss Re, the key\n\n\"reinsurance accepted\" provision in the certificate--which reads\n\n\n     6\n      See, e.g., Unigard, 4 F.3d at 1070-71 (follow-the-form);\nBellefonte Reinsurance Co. v.

The principal issue is whether, under several three-year reinsurance policies, Swiss Re was protected by a single per-occurrence limit on its liability for the three-year policy period or whether the limit applies separately for each policy year, thereby enlarging Swiss Re's total exposure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background events involve three different tiers of insurance, coverage periods that do not precisely overlap between tiers, and pertinent clauses that are not even identical from one policy to its successor. Accordingly, in setting the stage, some oversimplification as to the policies and some postponement of detail are both necessary. We begin at the ground floor with the insured, W.R. Grace &amp; Co. (\"Grace\"), a well-known company with many different facilities at different locations, and then work up through the tiers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the sites at issue in this case, Grace's primary insurer during the period in question (roughly 1962 to 1974) was Maryland Casualty Co. (\"Maryland\"). With a one-year exception that is not important to our case, that company provided coverage to Grace under five successive one-year policies between June 30, 1962, and June 30, 1967, and two three-year policies from June 30, 1967, to June 30, 1973. The policies covered personal injury and property damage up to $1 million per occurrence but with much lower limits ($25,000, later $100,000) for losses from \"gradual pollution.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between October 20, 1962, and June 30, 1974, Commercial Union's predecessors in interest provided excess liability coverage to Grace&#8212;that is, coverage starting at the point that the Maryland policies left off&#8212;in the form of four successive multi-year umbrella policies. (The first, second and fourth policies each ran for three years; the third ran for about two years and eight months.) The policies provided coverage in the amount of $5 million for each \"occurrence,\" defining \"occurrence\" to include \"an event, or continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which unexpectedly results in personal injury [or] property damage\" during the policy period, and continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ll personal injury and property damage. . . arising out of one event or continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions existing at or emanating from one premises location shall be deemed to be one occurrence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commercial Union policies also included clauses, known as \"follow-the-form\" clauses, that are designed to make coverage under a higher-tier policy (here, Commercial Union's) conform&#8212;subject to certain qualifications&#8212;to the coverage provided by the underlying policy (here, Maryland's policies). <i>See</i> 2 Ostrager &amp; Newman, <i>Handbook on Insurance Coverage Disputes</i> &#167; 13.01[a], at 868 (12th ed.2004). Thus, in the first two policies, the follow-the-form language provided that \"the terms, conditions and limitations of this policy will not be construed any more restrictive [sic] than the terms, conditions and limitations of Underlying Insurance.\" The latter two provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[s]uch coverage as is afforded by this policy shall apply to occurrences covered by the terms and conditions of [the underlying policy] or by the terms of conditions of this policy except that the definition of Property Damage as contained in this policy shall apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The top tier of coverage in this case was provided by Swiss Re, which offered not insurance for Grace but \"reinsurance\" to Commercial Union. Swiss Re agreed, under specified conditions, to indemnify Commercial Union for specified losses it might suffer under its excess insurance policies. The form of reinsurance used, called \"facultative,\" covers risks that the \"cedent\" (here, Commercial Union) bears under a specific policy or policies. 2 Ostrager &amp; Newman, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 15.03[a], at 996-97.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swiss Re issued three multi-year \"certificates\" to Commercial Union, corresponding to each of the last three (out of a total of four) multi-year excess liability policies that Commercial Union had written for Grace, <i>i.e.,</i> roughly for the period 1965 to 1974. Each Swiss Re certificate was skeletal, identifying the Commercial Union excess liability policy in question and agreeing to share a specified portion of Commercial Union's liability to Grace. Specifically, under the first certificate Swiss Re agreed to share 50 percent of Commercial Union's first $1 million in loss for \"each occurrence\"; under the second, 50 percent of the first $500,000; under the third, 37.5 percent of the first $500,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each certificate contained on the back side several standard conditions. These included variously phrased follow-the-form clauses saying that&#8212;except as \"otherwise specifically provided\" in the certificate&#8212;Swiss Re's liability would \"follow\" or \"be subject\" to the \"terms and conditions\" of Commercial Union's policies. Thus, through follow-the-form clauses, Swiss Re's policies looked back to Commercial Union's, and the latter's policies looked back to Maryland's policies with Grace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the Swiss Re certificates contained \"follow-the-fortunes\" provisions, which&#8212;where the case involves settlements&#8212;are sometimes called \"follow-the-settlements\" clauses. Such provisions are designed to give the cedent reasonable latitude to settle claims against it by the primary insured and to bind the reinsurer (in some measure) from contesting the extent of the cedent's liability to the primary insured. <i>See</i> Ostrager &amp; Vyskocil, <i>Modern Reinsurance Law &amp; Practice</i> &#167;&#167; 9.01.02 (1996); <i>Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London,</i> 96 N.Y.2d 583, 734 N.Y.S.2d 531, 760 N.E.2d 319, 328 (2001). Here, the follow-the-fortunes clause in each certificate reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All claims involving this reinsurance, when settled by [Commercial Union], shall be binding on [Swiss Re], which shall be bound to pay its proportion of such settlements promptly following receipt of proof of loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1980s, Grace began to notify Commercial Union of potential property damage losses due to hazardous waste pollution at various Grace sites. In 1988, Maryland filed a declaratory judgment action in federal district court in New York against Grace seeking to clarify Maryland's obligations under its primary policies. <i>See Md. Cas. Co. v. Cont'l Cas. Co.,</i> 332 F.3d 145, 148-49 (2d Cir.2003). Commercial Union and other insurers were added to the suit, and eventually the case expanded to involve over 200 waste sites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1998, Commercial Union settled with Grace based on information about nine \"focus\" waste sites (out of the forty for which Grace claimed Commercial Union was liable), for a single immediate payment of $57.6 million. The settlement was premised on estimates of projected liability over a substantial period due to damage at each site and on certain assumptions. Two such assumptions were (1) that the hazardous waste liability at each site should be allocated pro rata across the years of relevant insurance coverage at each site and (2) that the $5 million per-occurrence limit in each policy should be viewed as applying separately to each policy year, <i>i.e.,</i> $15 million for a three-year policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Commercial Union then sought indemnity from Swiss Re for $13.7 million (out of the $57.6 million paid to Grace), Swiss Re paid less than half that amount. It withheld part of the balance (about $6 million) on the ground that its reinsurance certificates protected it from any calculation of Commercial Union's liability to Grace, or Swiss Re's to Commercial Union, premised on the notion that the per-occurrence limit applied separately to each policy year (as opposed to the entire multi-year policy period). Swiss Re also disputed another aspect of the demand but that issue was apparently settled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court concluded that Swiss Re was correct on the \"annualization\" issue. The court held that Swiss Re's liability should be based on the premise that the per-occurrence limit applied once to a continuing leakage at a site over the multi-year policy period and not once for each year of the period. The court deemed this to be an explicit limit in each certificate, overriding any follow-the-form or follow-the-fortunes provision. This appeal by Commercial Union followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a grant of summary judgment <i>de novo.

Ordinarily, courts construe policy language in relation to specific facts, the policy language drawing meaning in part through interaction with a given fact pattern. Here, by contrast, the briefs tell us very little about what went wrong at any site, although the record modestly describes the actual conditions that gave rise to liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Seemingly the conditions varied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Swiss Re's view of the matter, the leakage at any one site during the three-year period covered by its certificate comprised a single \"occurrence.\" The term \"occurrence\" is not defined in the Swiss Re certificates but one plausible reading of the term would treat the entire continuous leakage as a single, albeit drawn out, occurrence; and, for such a reading Swiss Re can point to the definition of \"occurrence\" in the Commercial Union policies quoted above&#8212;namely, that continuous exposure to the same condition \"shall be deemed to be one occurrence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the leakage during the three-year period comprised one occurrence, then Commercial Union's liability to Grace for a three-year leak would be capped at $5 million and Swiss Re's liability to Commercial Union would be $500,000 (50 percent of the first $1 million). By contrast, if leakage during each year in the three-year period were treated as a separate occurrence, or (put differently) the cap applied year by year, Swiss Re could be liable for $1.5 million ($500,000 times three). The settlement with Grace assumed the latter view of the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the question were considered as a mechanical exercise in language&#8212;without the aid of \"follow\" clauses or policy arguments&#8212;Swiss Re might well have the stronger argument, just as the district court found. The policy period is three years, the continuous release of the one pollutant at one site can easily be described as one occurrence. So Swiss Re could be seen as merely insisting&#8212;in reliance on its own certificate's \"per occurrence\" language&#8212;on a cap of $500,000 in reinsurance for a single occurrence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A number of cases construing multi-year policies, and applying varying language to different factual scenarios, have construed caps in the fashion urged by Swiss Re and have rejected \"annualization\" glosses of the kind pressed by Commercial Union.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Only New Jersey has suggested an annualization approach may normally apply. <i>See, e.g., Benjamin Moore &amp; Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.,</i> 179 N.J. 87, 843 A.2d 1094, 1103 (2004); <i>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. United Ins. Co.,</i> 138 N.J. 437, 650 A.2d 974, 995 (1994). But for the most part the \"majority view\" cases did not implicate follow-the-form and follow-the-settlement clauses, and those clauses make a difference in our case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us start with Commercial Union's liability to Grace. Commercial Union's own policies contained language in their definition of occurrence quoted above, hostile to annualization. Yet the multi-year Maryland policies explicitly provided for their per occurrence limits to apply on an <i>annual</i> basis, as did the earlier one-year policies. So Grace could argue in any litigation with Commercial Union that the latter's obligations were governed by the former's policy given that Commercial Union's excess insurance policies contained a strong follow-the-form clause of its own.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, the follow-the-form provisions in Commercial Union's excess liability policies state (in one form) that the excess policy is no more restrictive than the Maryland policy and (in the other) that Commercial Union would cover any occurrences covered by the Maryland policy. Thus in <i>Hatco Corp. v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co.,</i> 801 F.Supp. 1334, 1354-55 (D.N.J.1992), the court held that a particular exclusion in Commercial Union's policy was overridden by the follow-form provision as construed in favor the insured. So, although New Jersey law has no application here, arguably Commercial Union's policy language should be read to dovetail with Maryland's policy, <i>i.e.,</i> by applying the caps on the same annualized basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Commercial Union's outside coverage counsel conducted a study of its excess liability policies and pertinent case law, reaching various tentative conclusions (at times concluding that annualization was unlikely, and at other times concluding that variations in language made annualization likely under some of Commercial Union's policies but not under others). In the end, counsel concluded in a settlement analysis and recommendation that annualization was a likely outcome in the then-ongoing New York law suit between the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether this view of Commercial Union's liability to Grace is correct or not, it is binding upon Swiss Re under its follow-the-fortunes clause so long as the settlement was reasonable and made in good faith. The follow-the-fortunes doctrine, designed in part to encourage settlement, <i>see N. River Ins. Co. v. CIGNA Reinsurance Co.,</i> 52 F.3d 1194, 1206 (3d Cir.1995), encompasses settlements that are arguably beyond the strict limits of the underlying cedent's policy (<i>i.e.,</i> the Commercial Union policies). The reinsurer must abide by cedent's \"good-faith payment\" so long as it is \"arguably within the scope of the insurance coverage\". <i>Mentor Ins. Co. (U.K.) v. Brannkasse,</i> 996 F.2d 506, 517 (2d Cir. 1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The premise that the settlement was based on annualized per-occurrence limits for Commercial Union, which could in theory be debated, <i>cf. Employers Reinsurance Corp. v. NewCap Ins. Co.,</i> 209 F.Supp.2d 1184, 1190-91 (D.Kan.2002), is supported by several factors: testimony that some components in Grace's settlement demands could not have been achieved without annualization, testimony that Grace's representatives said during settlement that their valuation used a \"pro rata annualized\" approach, and the use of annualization as a premise in the ultimate settlement analysis and recommendation by Commercial Union's coverage counsel. Swiss Re apparently pursued the issue during discovery but has not developed any objection on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, if the settlement were flatly inconsistent with the excess liability policy, Swiss Re would not be bound to respect it by a follow-the-settlements clause in its own certificate. <i>N. River Ins. Co.,</i> 52 F.3d at 1212 (\"Was the paid risk clearly outside the scope of the original policy's coverage?\"); <i>Aetna,</i> 882 F.Supp. at 1347 (\"<i>manifestly</i> outside\" the cedent's policy). But each Commercial Union policy as a whole includes not only its own anti-annualization language but its own follow-the-form clause, seemingly invoking the pro-annualization language of the underlying Maryland policy. Further, the insured would benefit from the usual canons of interpretation favoring the policy holder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Swiss Re's liability to Commercial Union under the terms of the reinsurance certificates. Even if Commercial Union were deemed liable to Grace, Commercial Union's right to the indemnity from Swiss Re is only for a specified share of Commercial Union's liability (<i>e.g.,</i> 50 percent of the first $1 million) for \"each occurrence.\" The \"occurrence\" language delimits Swiss Re's liability; the question is what the \"each occurrence\" language means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court read the phrase as if it meant, for a multi-year leak, that the leak was a single occurrence for the entire policy period so that the $500,000 cap applied once for the policy period. This is a defensible reading, as the cases cited above show, but one could also call the continuing leak a new occurrence every day or every drop. Or one could, as New Jersey seemingly does, adopt a prudential compromise reading that treated it as an occurrence for each year regardless of policy period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Swiss Re certificates could have contained a definition of \"occurrence\" in relation to continuing leaks, expressly negating annualization, but Swiss Re chose to provide no definition at all for this malleable word. Of course, one could read the Swiss Re policy as adopting the Commercial Union definition of the term via Swiss Re's follow-the-form clauses&#8212;but which Commercial Union definition? The explicit anti-annualization reading based on the occurrence definition or the pro-annualization follow-the-form version drawing on the Maryland policies' annualization provisions?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Commercial Union's liability to Grace has been established by a seemingly reasonable settlement made (so far as we know) in good faith. Under Swiss Re's follow-the-settlements clause it is bound to accept this pro-annualization reading of the Commercial Union policy for purposes of establishing Commercial Union's liability to Grace. In our view, Swiss Re's follow-the-form clause should be deemed to extend this reading into the parallel language in Swiss Re's own certificates subject only to any <i>clear</i> limitation to the contrary in the Swiss Re documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This view of the matter accords with the basic presumption of concurrence that we think exists where there is a skeleton reinsurance contract coupled with follow-the-form and follow-the-settlements clauses. According to a New York case, consistent with other authorities,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[w]here a following form clause is found in the reinsurance contract, concurrency between the policy of reinsurance and the reinsured policy is presumed, such that a policy of reinsurance will be construed as offering the same terms, conditions and scope of coverage as exist in the reinsured policy, i.e., in the absence of explicit language in the policy of reinsurance to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Aetna,</i> 882 F.Supp. at 1337. <i>Accord</i> Ostrager &amp; Vyskocil, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 2.03[a], at 2-9. Indeed, concurrence advances one of the basic purposes of reinsurance, which is \"[s]preading\" risk to prevent \"a catastrophic loss from falling upon one insurer.\" <i>Unigard,</i> 4 F.3d at 1053.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, if sufficiently clear, specific limits in the certificate control over the general aim of concurrence and ordinary \"follow\" clauses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Unfortunately for Swiss Re, the key \"reinsurance accepted\" provision in the certificate&#8212;which reads \"50% Quota Share part of first $1,000,000 each occurrence\"&#8212;is simply cryptic as applied to continuing leaks over a multi-year period under a multi-year policy. In such a situation, the balance is tipped in favor of making Swiss Re share liability on a basis that conforms its liability to that of the cedent where the cedent has settled reasonably and in good faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither side has pointed to extrinsic evidence&#8212;such as premium comparisons, expert testimony, or pertinent negotiations&#8212;that could illuminate this dispute. Nothing we have said in this decision should be taken to control a case in which a similar dispute is better illuminated by extrinsic evidence of any kind. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <i>Nat'l Tax Inst., Inc. v.

The principal issue is whether, under several three-year reinsurance policies, Swiss Re was protected by a single per-occurrence limit on its liability for the three-year policy period or whether the limit applies separately for each policy year, thereby enlarging Swiss Re's total exposure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background events involve three different tiers of insurance, coverage periods that do not precisely overlap between tiers, and pertinent clauses that are not even identical from one policy to its successor. Accordingly, in setting the stage, some oversimplification as to the policies and some postponement of detail are both necessary. We begin at the ground floor with the insured, W.R. Grace &amp; Co. (\"Grace\"), a well-known company with many different facilities at different locations, and then work up through the tiers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the sites at issue in this case, Grace's primary insurer during the period in question (roughly 1962 to 1974) was Maryland Casualty Co. (\"Maryland\"). With a one-year exception that is not important to our case, that company provided coverage to Grace under five successive one-year policies between June 30, 1962, and June 30, 1967, and two three-year policies from June 30, 1967, to June 30, 1973. The policies covered personal injury and property damage up to $1 million per occurrence but with much lower limits ($25,000, later $100,000) for losses from \"gradual pollution.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between October 20, 1962, and June 30, 1974, Commercial Union's predecessors in interest provided excess liability coverage to Grace&#8212;that is, coverage starting at the point that the Maryland policies left off&#8212;in the form of four successive multi-year umbrella policies. (The first, second and fourth policies each ran for three years; the third ran for about two years and eight months.) The policies provided coverage in the amount of $5 million for each \"occurrence,\" defining \"occurrence\" to include \"an event, or continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which unexpectedly results in personal injury [or] property damage\" during the policy period, and continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ll personal injury and property damage. . . arising out of one event or continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions existing at or emanating from one premises location shall be deemed to be one occurrence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commercial Union policies also included clauses, known as \"follow-the-form\" clauses, that are designed to make coverage under a higher-tier policy (here, Commercial Union's) conform&#8212;subject to certain qualifications&#8212;to the coverage provided by the underlying policy (here, Maryland's policies). <i>See</i> 2 Ostrager &amp; Newman, <i>Handbook on Insurance Coverage Disputes</i> &#167; 13.01[a], at 868 (12th ed.2004). Thus, in the first two policies, the follow-the-form language provided that \"the terms, conditions and limitations of this policy will not be construed any more restrictive [sic] than the terms, conditions and limitations of Underlying Insurance.\" The latter two provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[s]uch coverage as is afforded by this policy shall apply to occurrences covered by the terms and conditions of [the underlying policy] or by the terms of conditions of this policy except that the definition of Property Damage as contained in this policy shall apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The top tier of coverage in this case was provided by Swiss Re, which offered not insurance for Grace but \"reinsurance\" to Commercial Union. Swiss Re agreed, under specified conditions, to indemnify Commercial Union for specified losses it might suffer under its excess insurance policies. The form of reinsurance used, called \"facultative,\" covers risks that the \"cedent\" (here, Commercial Union) bears under a specific policy or policies. 2 Ostrager &amp; Newman, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 15.03[a], at 996-97.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swiss Re issued three multi-year \"certificates\" to Commercial Union, corresponding to each of the last three (out of a total of four) multi-year excess liability policies that Commercial Union had written for Grace, <i>i.e.,</i> roughly for the period 1965 to 1974. Each Swiss Re certificate was skeletal, identifying the Commercial Union excess liability policy in question and agreeing to share a specified portion of Commercial Union's liability to Grace. Specifically, under the first certificate Swiss Re agreed to share 50 percent of Commercial Union's first $1 million in loss for \"each occurrence\"; under the second, 50 percent of the first $500,000; under the third, 37.5 percent of the first $500,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each certificate contained on the back side several standard conditions. These included variously phrased follow-the-form clauses saying that&#8212;except as \"otherwise specifically provided\" in the certificate&#8212;Swiss Re's liability would \"follow\" or \"be subject\" to the \"terms and conditions\" of Commercial Union's policies. Thus, through follow-the-form clauses, Swiss Re's policies looked back to Commercial Union's, and the latter's policies looked back to Maryland's policies with Grace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the Swiss Re certificates contained \"follow-the-fortunes\" provisions, which&#8212;where the case involves settlements&#8212;are sometimes called \"follow-the-settlements\" clauses.

In 1988, Maryland filed a declaratory judgment action in federal district court in New York against Grace seeking to clarify Maryland's obligations under its primary policies. <i>See Md. Cas. Co. v. Cont'l Cas. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782280\"><a href=\"/opinion/782280/maryland-casualty-company-wr-grace-co-v-continental-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>, 148-49 (2d Cir.2003). Commercial Union and other insurers were added to the suit, and eventually the case expanded to involve over 200 waste sites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1998, Commercial Union settled with Grace based on information about nine \"focus\" waste sites (out of the forty for which Grace claimed Commercial Union was liable), for a single immediate payment of $57.6 million. The settlement was premised on estimates of projected liability over a substantial period due to damage at each site and on certain assumptions. Two such assumptions were (1) that the hazardous waste liability at each site should be allocated pro rata across the years of relevant insurance coverage at each site and (2) that the $5 million per-occurrence limit in each policy should be viewed as applying separately to each policy year, <i>i.e.,</i> $15 million for a three-year policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Commercial Union then sought indemnity from Swiss Re for $13.7 million (out of the $57.6 million paid to Grace), Swiss Re paid less than half that amount. It withheld part of the balance (about $6 million) on the ground that its reinsurance certificates protected it from any calculation of Commercial Union's liability to Grace, or Swiss Re's to Commercial Union, premised on the notion that the per-occurrence limit applied separately to each policy year (as opposed to the entire multi-year policy period). Swiss Re also disputed another aspect of the demand but that issue was apparently settled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court concluded that Swiss Re was correct on the \"annualization\" issue. The court held that Swiss Re's liability should be based on the premise that the per-occurrence limit applied once to a continuing leakage at a site over the multi-year policy period and not once for each year of the period. The court deemed this to be an explicit limit in each certificate, overriding any follow-the-form or follow-the-fortunes provision.

Against this background we turn to the merits of the dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A good deal about this case, in addition to the ill-worded policies and certificates themselves, remains obscure. Ordinarily, courts construe policy language in relation to specific facts, the policy language drawing meaning in part through interaction with a given fact pattern. Here, by contrast, the briefs tell us very little about what went wrong at any site, although the record modestly describes the actual conditions that gave rise to liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Seemingly the conditions varied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Swiss Re's view of the matter, the leakage at any one site during the three-year period covered by its certificate comprised a single \"occurrence.\" The term \"occurrence\" is not defined in the Swiss Re certificates but one plausible reading of the term would treat the entire continuous leakage as a single, albeit drawn out, occurrence; and, for such a reading Swiss Re can point to the definition of \"occurrence\" in the Commercial Union policies quoted above&#8212;namely, that continuous exposure to the same condition \"shall be deemed to be one occurrence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the leakage during the three-year period comprised one occurrence, then Commercial Union's liability to Grace for a three-year leak would be capped at $5 million and Swiss Re's liability to Commercial Union would be $500,000 (50 percent of the first $1 million). By contrast, if leakage during each year in the three-year period were treated as a separate occurrence, or (put differently) the cap applied year by year, Swiss Re could be liable for $1.5 million ($500,000 times three). The settlement with Grace assumed the latter view of the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the question were considered as a mechanical exercise in language&#8212;without the aid of \"follow\" clauses or policy arguments&#8212;Swiss Re might well have the stronger argument, just as the district court found. The policy period is three years, the continuous release of the one pollutant at one site can easily be described as one occurrence. So Swiss Re could be seen as merely insisting&#8212;in reliance on its own certificate's \"per occurrence\" language&#8212;on a cap of $500,000 in reinsurance for a single occurrence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A number of cases construing multi-year policies, and applying varying language to different factual scenarios, have construed caps in the fashion urged by Swiss Re and have rejected \"annualization\" glosses of the kind pressed by Commercial Union.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Only New Jersey has suggested an annualization approach may normally apply. <i>See, e.g., Benjamin Moore &amp; Co. v.

But for the most part the \"majority view\" cases did not implicate follow-the-form and follow-the-settlement clauses, and those clauses make a difference in our case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us start with Commercial Union's liability to Grace. Commercial Union's own policies contained language in their definition of occurrence quoted above, hostile to annualization. Yet the multi-year Maryland policies explicitly provided for their per occurrence limits to apply on an <i>annual</i> basis, as did the earlier one-year policies. So Grace could argue in any litigation with Commercial Union that the latter's obligations were governed by the former's policy given that Commercial Union's excess insurance policies contained a strong follow-the-form clause of its own.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, the follow-the-form provisions in Commercial Union's excess liability policies state (in one form) that the excess policy is no more restrictive than the Maryland policy and (in the other) that Commercial Union would cover any occurrences covered by the Maryland policy. Thus in <i>Hatco Corp. v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1944982\"><a href=\"/opinion/1944982/hatco-corp-v-wr-grace-co-conn/\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1334</span></a></span>, 1354-55 (D.N.J.1992), the court held that a particular exclusion in Commercial Union's policy was overridden by the follow-form provision as construed in favor the insured. So, although New Jersey law has no application here, arguably Commercial Union's policy language should be read to dovetail with Maryland's policy, <i>i.e.,</i> by applying the caps on the same annualized basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Commercial Union's outside coverage counsel conducted a study of its excess liability policies and pertinent case law, reaching various tentative conclusions (at times concluding that annualization was unlikely, and at other times concluding that variations in language made annualization likely under some of Commercial Union's policies but not under others). In the end, counsel concluded in a settlement analysis and recommendation that annualization was a likely outcome in the then-ongoing New York law suit between the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether this view of Commercial Union's liability to Grace is correct or not, it is binding upon Swiss Re under its follow-the-fortunes clause so long as the settlement was reasonable and made in good faith. The follow-the-fortunes doctrine, designed in part to encourage settlement, <i>see N. River Ins. Co. v. CIGNA Reinsurance Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"694584\"><a href=\"/opinion/694584/north-river-insurance-company-v-cigna-reinsurance-company-individually/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span>, 1206 (3d Cir.1995), encompasses settlements that are arguably beyond the strict limits of the underlying cedent's policy (<i>i.e.,</i> the Commercial Union policies). The reinsurer must abide by cedent's \"good-faith payment\" so long as it is \"arguably within the scope of the insurance coverage\". <i>Mentor Ins. Co. (U.K.) v.

Employers Reinsurance Corp. v. NewCap Ins.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span>, 1190-91 (D.Kan.2002), is supported by several factors: testimony that some components in Grace's settlement demands could not have been achieved without annualization, testimony that Grace's representatives said during settlement that their valuation used a \"pro rata annualized\" approach, and the use of annualization as a premise in the ultimate settlement analysis and recommendation by Commercial Union's coverage counsel. Swiss Re apparently pursued the issue during discovery but has not developed any objection on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, if the settlement were flatly inconsistent with the excess liability policy, Swiss Re would not be bound to respect it by a follow-the-settlements clause in its own certificate. <i>N. River Ins. Co.,</i> 52 F.3d at 1212 (\"Was the paid risk clearly outside the scope of the original policy's coverage?\"); <i>Aetna,</i> 882 F.Supp. at 1347 (\"<i>manifestly</i> outside\" the cedent's policy). But each Commercial Union policy as a whole includes not only its own anti-annualization language but its own follow-the-form clause, seemingly invoking the pro-annualization language of the underlying Maryland policy. Further, the insured would benefit from the usual canons of interpretation favoring the policy holder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Swiss Re's liability to Commercial Union under the terms of the reinsurance certificates. Even if Commercial Union were deemed liable to Grace, Commercial Union's right to the indemnity from Swiss Re is only for a specified share of Commercial Union's liability (<i>e.g.,</i> 50 percent of the first $1 million) for \"each occurrence.\" The \"occurrence\" language delimits Swiss Re's liability; the question is what the \"each occurrence\" language means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court read the phrase as if it meant, for a multi-year leak, that the leak was a single occurrence for the entire policy period so that the $500,000 cap applied once for the policy period. This is a defensible reading, as the cases cited above show, but one could also call the continuing leak a new occurrence every day or every drop. Or one could, as New Jersey seemingly does, adopt a prudential compromise reading that treated it as an occurrence for each year regardless of policy period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Swiss Re certificates could have contained a definition of \"occurrence\" in relation to continuing leaks, expressly negating annualization, but Swiss Re chose to provide no definition at all for this malleable word. Of course, one could read the Swiss Re policy as adopting the Commercial Union definition of the term via Swiss Re's follow-the-form clauses&#8212;but which Commercial Union definition? The explicit anti-annualization reading based on the occurrence definition or the pro-annualization follow-the-form version drawing on the Maryland policies' annualization provisions?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Commercial Union's liability to Grace has been established by a seemingly reasonable settlement made (so far as we know) in good faith. Under Swiss Re's follow-the-settlements clause it is bound to accept this pro-annualization reading of the Commercial Union policy for purposes of establishing Commercial Union's liability to Grace. In our view, Swiss Re's follow-the-form clause should be deemed to extend this reading into the parallel language in Swiss Re's own certificates subject only to any <i>clear</i> limitation to the contrary in the Swiss Re documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This view of the matter accords with the basic presumption of concurrence that we think exists where there is a skeleton reinsurance contract coupled with follow-the-form and follow-the-settlements clauses. According to a New York case, consistent with other authorities,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[w]here a following form clause is found in the reinsurance contract, concurrency between the policy of reinsurance and the reinsured policy is presumed, such that a policy of reinsurance will be construed as offering the same terms, conditions and scope of coverage as exist in the reinsured policy, i.e., in the absence of explicit language in the policy of reinsurance to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Aetna,</i> 882 F.Supp. at 1337. <i>Accord</i> Ostrager &amp; Vyskocil, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 2.03[a], at 2-9. Indeed, concurrence advances one of the basic purposes of reinsurance, which is \"[s]preading\" risk to prevent \"a catastrophic loss from falling upon one insurer.\" <i>Unigard,</i> 4 F.3d at 1053.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, if sufficiently clear, specific limits in the certificate control over the general aim of concurrence and ordinary \"follow\" clauses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Unfortunately for Swiss Re, the key \"reinsurance accepted\" provision in the certificate&#8212;which reads \"50% Quota Share part of first $1,000,000 each occurrence\"&#8212;is simply cryptic as applied to continuing leaks over a multi-year period under a multi-year policy. In such a situation, the balance is tipped in favor of making Swiss Re share liability on a basis that conforms its liability to that of the cedent where the cedent has settled reasonably and in good faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither side has pointed to extrinsic evidence&#8212;such as premium comparisons, expert testimony, or pertinent negotiations&#8212;that could illuminate this dispute.
