Nadel, Attorney, Office of\nImmigration Litigation, Civil Division, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                          July 14, 2006\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.    The petitioner, Marco Silva, is a\n\nPortuguese national and a lawful permanent resident of the United\n\nStates.   He seeks judicial review of a final order of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA) finding him removable by reason of his\n\ncommission of an aggravated felony under the Immigration and\n\nNationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).    Concluding,\n\nas we do, that the petitioner's conviction for statutory rape\n\nconstituted a conviction for an aggravated felony, we deny and\n\ndismiss his petition for review.\n\n           The facts are straightforward.      The petitioner, then\n\nseven years of age, was admitted to the United States as a lawful\n\npermanent resident on April 23, 1985.      On February 25, 2000, he\n\npleaded guilty to a charge of statutory rape in the Bristol County\n\n(Massachusetts) Superior Court.1     The offense involved a fourteen-\n\nyear-old girl.   The presiding judge sentenced the petitioner to\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The statute of conviction, entitled \"Rape and Abuse of a\nChild,\" provides in pertinent part:\n\n     Whoever unlawfully has sexual intercourse or unnatural\n     sexual intercourse, and abuses a child under sixteen\n     years of age shall, for the first offense, be punished by\n     imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term\n     of years, or, except as otherwise provided, for any term\n     in a jail or house of correction . . . provided, however,\n     that a prosecution commenced under the provisions of this\n     section shall not be placed on file or continued without\n     a finding.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 23.\n\n                                   -2-\n\flifetime probation and ordered him to stay away from children under\n\nthe age of sixteen.\n\n            In    short   order,   the    Immigration   and    Naturalization\n\nService (INS), citing the petitioner's conviction for an aggravated\n\nfelony, initiated removal proceedings against him.2              See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).       The petitioner did not dispute the fact of\n\nthe underlying conviction but nonetheless denied that he was\n\nremovable as an aggravated felon and cross-applied for termination\n\nof the removal proceedings.              After conducting an evidentiary\n\nhearing, an Immigration Judge (IJ) found that the petitioner's\n\nstate-court conviction was \"first of all, for the crime of rape\"\n\nand, therefore, constituted a conviction for an aggravated felony\n\nwithin the purview of the INA.               Taking a belt-and-suspenders\n\napproach, the IJ ruled that the conviction was also one \"for the\n\ncrime of abuse of a child\" and qualified under the aggravated\n\nfelony rubric on that basis as well.            Accordingly, the IJ denied\n\nthe request for termination of the removal proceedings and ordered\n\nthe petitioner removed to Portugal.\n\n            The petitioner appealed.         On September 30, 2005, the BIA\n\nsummarily   affirmed      the   IJ's   decision.     This     timely   petition\n\nfollowed.        Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms an IJ's\n\n\n     2\n      The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, §\n471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. § 291),\nabolished the INS and transferred its duties to the Department of\nHomeland Security. See Lattab v. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 13 n.2 (1st\nCir. 2004). For simplicity's sake, we refer throughout to the INS.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fdecision, we review the latter decision as if it were the progeny\n\nof the BIA.      See Olujoke v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n              Under the INA, as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005,3\n\n\"no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of\n\nremoval against an alien who is removable by reason of having\n\ncommitted a criminal offense [including an aggravated felony].\"                     8\n\nU.S.C.    §    1252(a)(2)(C).        As    an    exception    to    this    express\n\njurisdictional bar, the statute permits judicial review of a\n\nremoval   order       to   the   extent   that   an   alien   raises       legal   or\n\nconstitutional questions.            See id. § 1252(a)(2)(D); see also\n\nMehilli v. Gonzales, 433 F.3d 86, 92 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n              Here,    the   petitioner     argues    that    the   IJ     erred   in\n\ncharacterizing his state-court conviction as one for an aggravated\n\nfelony. Because this argument poses an abstract legal question, we\n\nhave jurisdiction to entertain it.               See Aguiar v. Gonzales, 438\n\nF.3d 86, 88 (1st Cir. 2006).              Our review is de novo.           See id.;\n\nUrena-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 51, 53-54 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n              The INA provides that \"[a]ny alien who is convicted of an\n\naggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\"                      8\n\nU.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).               The Act enumerates a roster of\n\n\n     3\n      The relevant section of the REAL ID Act took effect\nimmediately upon enactment on May 11, 2005. It applies to final\norders of removal issued \"before, on, or after\" that date. REAL ID\nAct of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, Div. B, § 106(b), 119 Stat. 231,\n310-11 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1252).\n\n                                          -4-\n\foffenses that fit within the compass of the term \"aggravated\n\nfelony.\"   See id. § 1101(a)(43).           Included at the head of this\n\ncompendium are \"murder, rape, [and] sexual abuse of a minor.\"             Id.\n\n§ 1101(a)(43)(A).\n\n           Before us, the petitioner vigorously attacks the IJ's\n\n\"aggravated felony\" holding.      He asseverates that statutory rape\n\ndoes not constitute \"sexual abuse of a minor\" within the meaning of\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(A).      Building on that foundation, he then\n\nasseverates that his conviction is not for an aggravated felony.4\n\nThese asseverations overlook that the IJ's decision rests on an\n\nindependently adequate and unchallenged ground: a determination\n\nthat the petitioner had been convicted of \"rape\" — a specifically\n\nenumerated offense under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(A). The petitioner\n\nhas not in any way, shape, or form challenged that determination,\n\nnor has he challenged the IJ's corollary determination that he was\n\nremovable, as an aggravated felon, on that basis.\n\n           We   have   held,   with    a    regularity   bordering   on   the\n\nmonotonous, that litigants have \"an obligation to spell out [their]\n\n\n\n     4\n      The petitioner also asserts that his conduct did not\notherwise amount to the commission of a \"crime of violence\" within\nthe purview of 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F).      This is a peculiar\nargument.    While 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F) treats crimes of\nviolence as aggravated felonies, the INS never charged the\npetitioner with removeability under that provision, nor did the IJ\nfind the petitioner removable pursuant to it.           Thus, the\npetitioner, in mounting a \"crime of violence\" argument, is setting\nup and then attempting to topple a straw man. Consequently, we pay\nno heed to that aspect of his asseverational array.\n\n                                      -5-\n\farguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold [their]\n\npeace.\"      United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see Redondo-\n\nBorges v. U.S. Dep't of Hous. and Urban Dev., 421 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (explaining that a \"reviewing court cannot be expected\n\nto do counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put\n\nflesh   on    its   bones\")    (citation     and   internal      quotation   marks\n\nomitted); Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp., 904 F.2d 83, 87 (1st Cir.\n\n1990) (concluding that arguments not made in a party's opening\n\nbrief are deemed waived on appeal).                  By not setting out any\n\ndeveloped argumentation to contradict the IJ's classification of\n\nhis conviction as a conviction for rape, the petitioner has waived\n\nany challenge to that determination.\n\n             To cinch matters, the petitioner never challenged the\n\nclassification of his state crime as a rape (and, thus, as an\n\naggravated felony) before the BIA.               That omission constitutes a\n\nbreach of the INA's exhaustion requirement.                      See 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(d)(1)     (limiting      review   of    a   final   order    of   removal   to\n\ncircumstances in which \"the alien has exhausted all administrative\n\nremedies available to [him] as of right\").               When an argument could\n\nhave been, but was not, advanced before the BIA, we consistently\n\nhave rejected belated efforts to resurrect the foregone argument on\n\njudicial review, deeming such efforts barred by non-exhaustion\n\nprinciples.      See, e.g., Roberts v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 33, 37 n.2\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f(1st Cir. 2005); Opere v. INS, 267 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 2001);\n\nPrado v. Reno, 198 F.3d 286, 292 (1st Cir. 1999).                 Those holdings\n\napply here: because the petitioner, before the BIA, never contested\n\nthe IJ's determination that his conviction constituted a conviction\n\nfor rape, non-exhaustion principles bar further review.\n\n              We add a coda.    Even if this argument had been preserved\n\n— which it was not — it would have been unavailing.                By its plain\n\nterms, the INA provides that \"rape\" is an aggravated felony.                   See\n\n8    U.S.C.   §   1101(a)(43)(A).        \"[C]ourts   must    presume      that   a\n\nlegislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute\n\nwhat it says there.\"       Conn. Nat'l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249,\n\n253-54 (1992).      When, as in this instance, the statutory language\n\nis   unambiguous    and   the   result    required   by     the    text   is   not\n\nchimerical, the proper province of the court is to enforce the\n\nstatute according to its tenor.          Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v.\n\nUnion Planters Bank, N.A., 530 U.S. 1, 6 (2000); Lopez-Soto v.\n\nHawayek, 175 F.3d 170, 172 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n              That ends the matter.      Here, the statute of conviction,\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 23, specifically terms the crime of\n\nconviction \"[r]ape.\"      Under the explicit language of the INA, all\n\nrape — including statutory rape — comes within the aggravated\n\nfelony taxonomy. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(A); see also Mattis v.\n\nReno, 212 F.3d 31, 34-35 (1st Cir. 2000) (superseded on other\n\ngrounds) (holding that \"statutory rape . . . is an aggravated\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\ffelony under INA § 101(a)(43)(A)\"). It follows inexorably that the\n\npetitioner's state-court conviction was properly classified as a\n\nconviction for an aggravated felony.\n\n               To be sure, the petitioner contends that his offense\n\ncannot    be    regarded    as     an   aggravated   felony     because    of   the\n\ncircumstances       of    the     particular    crime.   In    this   regard,   he\n\nemphasizes that his relationship with the victim was consensual.\n\nThis sortie is easily repulsed: consent is not a defense to a\n\ncharge of statutory rape.            See Commonwealth v. Elder, 452 N.E.2d\n\n1104,    1111    n.14    (Mass.    1983).      Rather,   the   law    conclusively\n\npresumes that a minor cannot give meaningful consent.                  See Aguiar,\n\n438 F.3d at 90.         The fact of consent is, thus, irrelevant in this\n\ncase.\n\n               We can go no further.        The petitioner's challenge to the\n\nfactual circumstances underlying the IJ's order of removal is\n\nbeyond our jurisdiction.            See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C); see also\n\nAguiar, 438 F.3d at 88.           Since we have reached the conclusion that\n\nthe petitioner was convicted of rape — an aggravated felony — we\n\nhave no jurisdiction to consider on direct review any fact-based\n\nclaim embedded in his petition.\n\n\n\nThe petition for review is denied and dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f",

He seeks judicial review of a final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) finding him removable by reason of his commission of an aggravated felony under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Concluding, as we do, that the petitioner's conviction for statutory rape constituted a conviction for an aggravated felony, we deny and dismiss his petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are straightforward. The petitioner, then seven years of age, was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on April 23, 1985. On February 25, 2000, he pleaded guilty to a charge of statutory rape in the Bristol County (Massachusetts) Superior Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The offense involved a fourteen-year-old girl. The presiding judge sentenced the petitioner to lifetime probation and ordered him to stay away from children under the age of sixteen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short order, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), citing the petitioner's conviction for an aggravated felony, initiated removal proceedings against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The petitioner did not dispute the fact of the underlying conviction but nonetheless denied that he was removable as an aggravated felon and cross-applied for termination of the removal proceedings. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, an Immigration Judge (IJ) found that the petitioner's state-court conviction was \"first of all, for the crime of rape\" and, therefore, constituted a conviction for an aggravated felony within the purview of the INA. Taking a belt-and-suspenders approach, the IJ ruled that the conviction was also one \"for the crime of abuse of a child\" and qualified under the aggravated felony rubric on that basis as well. Accordingly, the IJ denied the request for termination of the removal proceedings and ordered the petitioner removed to Portugal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner appealed. On September 30, 2005, the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's decision. This timely petition followed. Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms an IJ's decision, we review the latter decision as if it were the progeny of the BIA. <i>See Olujoke v.

This is a peculiar argument. While 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(F) treats crimes of violence as aggravated felonies, the INS never charged the petitioner with removability under that provision, nor did the IJ find the petitioner removable pursuant to it. Thus, the petitioner, in mounting a \"crime of violence\" argument, is setting up and then attempting to topple a straw man. Consequently, we pay no heed to that aspect of his asseverational array</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
