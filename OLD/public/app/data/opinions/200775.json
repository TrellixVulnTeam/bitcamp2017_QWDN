Following a five-day trial, a\n\njury convicted co-defendants Luis Lugo-Velez and Jean Carlos Cruz\n\nof, inter alia, possession of narcotics with intent to distribute\n\nand   possession   of   firearms   --    including   machine   guns   –-   in\n\nfurtherance of a drug-trafficking scheme.             These consolidated\n\nappeals require us to decide (1) whether the district court erred\n\nin various evidentiary rulings, and (2) whether the evidence was\n\nsufficient to support the verdicts.        Having carefully reviewed the\n\nrecord, we affirm the convictions of both defendants.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdicts.     See United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 676 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).\n\n            On October 15, 2001, Puerto Rico Police Agent Angel\n\nAviles parked an unmarked vehicle in front of dead-end Street 2A in\n\nToa Alta and began surveillance of an area known within the police\n\ndepartment to be a drug point.          Agent Aviles immediately focused\n\nhis attention on three individuals –- later identified as Lugo,\n\nCruz, and Jose Gonzalez Bernard -- standing 40 feet away from him,\n\noutside a bar known as \"The Pub.\"        Each man was carrying a firearm\n\non his waistline; in addition, Cruz had a \"fanny pack\" strapped\n\nacross his chest and appeared \"ready to receive money from some\n\nperson.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f          Agent Aviles next observed an unidentified man, who was\n\ncarrying money, approach Cruz from an unidentified vehicle that had\n\njust arrived on the scene. After encountering Cruz, the individual\n\nreturned to his vehicle and drove away.      The substance of this\n\nmeeting –- namely, whether there had been an actual exchange of\n\ndrugs or money -- was not witnessed.\n\n          At one point during his surveillance, Agent Aviles saw\n\nGonzalez disappear around the side of The Pub; when Gonzalez\n\nreappeared, he and another unidentified individual were carrying a\n\npillowcase that had rifle barrels protruding from it.1    These men\n\nthen lifted the pillowcase, placed it into a nearby garbage can,\n\nand, with the assistance of Lugo and Cruz, covered it with a\n\nblanket and some trash.   After witnessing these activities, Agent\n\nAviles immediately called for backup.\n\n          When the reinforcement agents arrived three to four\n\nminutes later, backup Agent Luis Sales-Morales noticed that Cruz\n\nwas carrying a pistol on his waistline.    During an ensuing chase,\n\nAgent Sales saw Cruz toss his firearm into an overgrown lot.\n\nAlthough the handgun was never recovered, Cruz was eventually\n\narrested as he tried to scale a fence.    At the time of his arrest,\n\nCruz was carrying a nine-millimeter magazine, $526 cash, and a\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The record is unclear as to whether these events occurred\nbefore or after Cruz's encounter with the unidentified, money-\ncarrying individual.\n\n                               -4-\n\ffanny pack (strapped across his chest) containing substances that\n\nlater tested positive for cocaine base, heroin, and cocaine.\n\n            Meanwhile,   backup   Agent   Nancy   Mendez   was   pursuing\n\nGonzalez.     When she caught him just outside The Pub, Gonzalez\n\nattempted to draw his weapon.      In response, Agent Mendez grabbed\n\nhis arm and was dragged inside The Pub.     There, during her struggle\n\nwith Gonzalez, she observed Lugo for the first time; he was\n\nstanding behind the bar with a gun in his hand.            Agent Aviles\n\ntestified as to how and when Lugo had entered The Pub: \"I saw\n\nMendez who was going to arrest the defendants, and they started\n\nrunning.    At that moment, I started running, following her.      So she\n\nwent into [The Pub] after, going after the defendants.\"\n\n            Gonzalez eventually surrendered and was taken outside The\n\nPub and arrested. Once outside, Agent Mendez told another agent to\n\ngo inside The Pub, arrest Lugo, and seize the firearm that she had\n\nseen him conceal between a bottle rack and the bar.\n\n            Lugo was arrested without incident. Although no drugs or\n\nweapons were found on his person, agents successfully recovered the\n\npistol –- a loaded nine-millimeter Smith & Wesson –- that Lugo had\n\nhidden behind the bar.\n\n            The principal suspects having been apprehended, Agent\n\nAviles next seized the pillowcase from the garbage can. Inside the\n\npillowcase were two Romanian Arms rifles that, as an expert witness\n\nlater testified, had been converted into machine guns, as well as\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fan arsenal rifle, a pistol, and large amounts of ammunition.              The\n\nserial numbers on the two machine guns and the pistol had been\n\nremoved, and all four firearms were loaded.\n\n              On November 8, 2001, a federal grand jury returned an\n\nindictment charging Lugo, Cruz, and Gonzalez with several offenses:\n\nCount One alleged that the defendants, aiding and abetting each\n\nother,     knowingly   possessed   cocaine   base   with   the   intent    to\n\ndistribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. §\n\n2; Count Two alleged that the defendants, aiding and abetting each\n\nother, knowingly possessed heroin with the intent to distribute, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2; Count Three\n\nalleged that the defendants, aiding and abetting each other,\n\nknowingly possessed cocaine with the intent to distribute, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2;2 Count Five\n\nalleged that the defendants, aiding and abetting each other,\n\npossessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking scheme, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2; Count Six\n\nalleged that the defendants, aiding and abetting each other,\n\nknowingly possessed a firearm shipped or transported in interstate\n\ncommerce and from which the manufacturer's serial number had been\n\nobliterated or removed, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(k) and 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2; and Count Seven alleged that the defendants, aiding and\n\n\n\n\n     2\n         Count Four is not relevant to this appeal.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fabetting each other, possessed a machine gun, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 922(o) and 18 U.S.C. § 2.\n\n             On February 13, 2002, a joint trial began, at which Cruz\n\nand Lugo were co-defendants.3    On February 20th, the jury convicted\n\nboth defendants on all counts.     Thereafter, Cruz was sentenced to\n\nconcurrent prison terms of 63 months for Counts One, Two, and Three\n\nand 60 months for Counts Six and Seven.       Lugo was sentenced to\n\nconcurrent prison terms of 51 months for Counts One, Two, and Three\n\nand 60 months for Counts Six and Seven.    Additionally, because the\n\njury found that each defendant had possessed a machine gun in\n\nfurtherance of a drug-trafficking scheme, both Cruz and Lugo were\n\nsentenced to 360 months of imprisonment for Count Five, to be\n\nserved consecutive to their other sentences.4       See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(c)(1)(B).\n\n             These appeals followed.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n         Gonzalez pled guilty and is not a party to this proceeding.\n     4\n      The 360-month sentences imposed for Count Five were in\naddition to, and separate from, the sentences imposed for Count\nSeven.   Count Five charged the defendants with possession of\nfirearms –- including machine guns -– in furtherance of a drug-\ntrafficking scheme. In convicting the defendants on Count Five,\nthe jury answered \"yes\" to all three of the following options: one\nor more pistols; one or more rifles; one or more machine guns.\n\n     Count Seven charged the defendants with mere possession of\nmachine guns, which is made illegal under 18 U.S.C. § 922(o).\n\n                                  -7-\n\f                                       II.\n\n            We are presented with two issues on appeal: (1) whether\n\nthe district court erred in various evidentiary rulings; and\n\n(2) whether the evidence was sufficient to support the verdicts.\n\n            Given these separate issues, two standards of review\n\napply.     First, we review a district court's decision to admit\n\nevidence for abuse of discretion.              See Larch v. Mansfield Mun.\n\nElec. Dept., 272 F.3d 63, 72 (1st Cir. 2001); see also Udemba v.\n\nNicoli, 237 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"[A] trial court enjoys\n\nconsiderable       discretion   in   connection     with   the    admission   or\n\nexclusion of evidence. . . .\").             Second, in deciding sufficiency\n\nchallenges, \"we review all the evidence, direct and circumstantial,\n\nin   the   light    most   favorable   to    the   prosecution,    drawing    all\n\nreasonable inferences consistent with the verdict, and avoiding\n\ncredibility judgments, to determine whether a rational jury could\n\nhave found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"5               United States v.\n\nBaltas, 236 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir. 2001) (citations omitted); see\n\nalso United States v. Ruiz, 105 F.3d 1492, 1495 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(noting that \"we review de novo the defendants' challenge to the\n\n\n      5\n      Following the government's presentation of its case-in-chief,\nboth Cruz and Lugo moved unsuccessfully for judgments of acquittal\npursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.        Each defendant thereafter\npresented evidence in his own defense, thus waiving review of his\ninitial motion. See United States v. Ruiz, 105 F.3d 1492, 1495 n.1\n(1st Cir. 1997) (citing United States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288, 291\n(1st Cir. 1992)). Therefore, we review the evidence presented by\nCruz and Lugo during their cases-in-chief in the light most\nfavorable to the verdicts. See Ruiz, 105 F.3d at 1495 n.1.\n\n                                       -8-\n\fevidentiary       sufficiency   of   their   convictions,   construing   the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the government\").\n\n             A.    Evidentiary Rulings\n\n             Lugo contends that the district court improperly admitted\n\n(1) \"unduly prejudicial testimony concerning the presence of a drug\n\npoint on 2A Street near The Pub,\" and (2) \"various untagged weapons\n\nwith obliterated serial numbers, [specifically] the two machine\n\nguns.\"6     We find no abuse of discretion.\n\n(1) The Drug-Point Testimony\n\n             Despite objection, Agent Aviles was allowed to testify at\n\ntrial as follows:\n\n             Q: Now, the young man to this side of the\n             table [Cruz], can you please tell us what, if\n             anything, was he doing, aside from the fact\n             that he had a weapon in his waist?\n\n             A: [Cruz] was standing there. He had like a\n             brown bag, and he was ready to receive money\n             from some person. I have knowledge that that\n             is the drug point of that sector.\n\n             Q: Excuse me.      Before you go into anything\n             else --\n\n             COURT: Let him finish.\n\n             A: Personally myself I've arrested several\n             people at that location for violation of\n             weapons and drug laws.\n\n             Lugo argues that this testimony should have been excluded\n\nbecause \"[Agent] Aviles' assertions [regarding the 'drug point']\n\n\n\n     6\n         Cruz does not contest any evidentiary rulings.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fwere unsupported by statistics, personal knowledge, or details –-\n\nand they were unduly prejudicial.\"      As best we can tell,7 Lugo is\n\nchallenging the drug-point testimony on two separate bases: (a)\n\nlack of foundation, in violation of Fed. R. Evid. 602; and (b)\n\nunfair prejudice, in violation of Fed. R. Evid. 403.      Neither is\n\nconvincing.8\n\n           First, contrary to Lugo's assertion, the government did,\n\nin fact, present evidence sufficient to support a finding that\n\nAgent Aviles had the requisite personal knowledge of the area's\n\nhistory.   See Fed. R. Evid. 602 (\"A witness may not testify to a\n\nmatter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a\n\nfinding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.\n\nEvidence to prove personal knowledge may, but need not, consist of\n\nthe   witness'   own   testimony.\").    Specifically,   Agent   Aviles\n\ntestified that he had been a member of the Drugs and Narcotics\n\nDivision of the Puerto Rico Police Department for approximately six\n\nyears, that he had been involved with approximately 80 or 90\n\ninvestigations involving drug points, that he knew of other agents\n\nwho had made drug arrests outside The Pub, and that he himself had\n\n\n\n\n      7\n      Lugo's brief refers neither to the Federal Rules of Evidence\nnor to case law.\n      8\n      Lugo also contends that the government should not have been\nallowed to refer to the drug-point testimony in its closing\nargument. Because we reject the underlying evidentiary challenges\nto the drug-point testimony, this contention fails.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fpreviously arrested an individual on drug charges outside The Pub.9\n\nIn addition, three other agents provided corroborating testimony\n\nthat the area in front of The Pub was known within the police\n\ndepartment to be a drug point.    Given the testimony of these four\n\nwitnesses, the district court acted well within its discretion in\n\ndetermining that there was an adequate foundation for Agent Aviles'\n\ntestimony.\n\n          We next consider whether the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in determining that the drug-point testimony was not\n\nunduly prejudicial.     See Fed. R. Evid. 403 (\"Although relevant,\n\nevidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice . . . .\" (emphasis\n\nadded)); see also United States v. Pitrone, 115 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (\"Virtually all evidence is prejudicial -– if the truth be\n\ntold, that is almost always why the proponent seeks to introduce it\n\n–- but it is only unfair prejudice against which the law protects.\"\n\n(emphasis retained)).    According to Lugo, this testimony \"allowed\n\n[the jury] to infer impermissibly that[,] because Mr. Lugo was\n\narrested at a 'point,' he must have been involved in the drug trade\n\nthere.\"\n\n\n\n\n     9\n      On direct examination, Agent Aviles testified that he had\npersonally arrested \"several people\" at the drug point. However,\non cross examination, Agent Aviles indicated that he had only made\none such arrest.\n\n                                 -11-\n\f           \"Only   rarely   –-   and    in extraordinarily compelling\n\ncircumstances –- will we, from the vista of a cold appellate\n\nrecord, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning\n\nthe relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\"\n\nFreeman v. Package Machinery Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir.\n\n1988).    This is not such a circumstance.       Here, the drug-point\n\ntestimony was probative not only to explain Agent Aviles' presence\n\nat the scene but also to corroborate the inference that Cruz and\n\nLugo were involved in a drug-trafficking scheme –- a scheme that\n\nwould be independently suggested by other evidence. So understood,\n\nthe district court could have concluded that the prejudice caused\n\nby such testimony was not unfair; it was, instead, merely the\n\nnegative result of the testimony's probative value.\n\n(2) The Machine Guns\n\n           Lugo next argues that the two machine guns were not\n\nproperly authenticated, see Fed. R. Evid. 901(a), and thus should\n\nnot have been admitted into evidence.      We disagree.10\n\n\n\n\n     10\n      The record indicates that Lugo objected to the admission of\nthe second of these two weapons but not the first.      Failure to\npreserve a claim of error as to the admission of the first machine\ngun does, of course, affect our standard of review. See United\nStates v. Roberts, 119 F.3d 1006, 1014 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"[E]rrors\nnot objected to at trial will be reviewed by the appellate court\nonly when they are 'plain' and undermine the fundamental fairness\nof the trial.\" (citations omitted)).      However, because Lugo's\nargument fails even under the more appellant-friendly abuse-of-\ndiscretion standard discussed above, we need not provide a separate\nanalysis for each weapon.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f          \"Federal Rule of Evidence 901(a) requires the trial court\n\nto determine if there is a 'reasonable probability' that the\n\nevidence is what it is purported to be.\"   United States v. Neal, 36\n\nF.3d 1190, 1210 (1st Cir. 1994); see also United States v. Twitty,\n\n72 F.3d 228, 232 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"All that was required for\n\nadmission was evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to\n\nconclude that the guns were the same . . . .\").\n\n          Here, two agents were called to authenticate the machine\n\nguns.   First, Agent Aviles testified to the following chronology:\n\n(1) immediately following the arrests, he himself seized the\n\npillowcase from the garbage can; (2) the pillowcase's contents,\n\nincluding two Romanian Arms rifles, were then taken to police\n\nheadquarters; (3) Agent Aviles next phoned Agent Rios from the\n\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and requested that Rios\n\ntravel to headquarters to take possession of the weapons; and (4)\n\nthe weapons remained in his custody until Agent Rios arrived.\n\nSecond, Agent Rios testified (1) that, upon arriving at police\n\nheadquarters on October 15, 2001, he prepared a property receipt\n\n(describing the contents of the pillowcase), which both he and\n\nAviles signed; (2) that he thereafter took possession of the\n\nweapons; (3) that, two days later, on October 17, 2001, he prepared\n\na property-inventory form, on which the seized weapons were listed;\n\nand (4) that the weapons remained in his custody from October 15th\n\nthrough October 17th.   Both men testified that the weapons sought\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fto be introduced at trial were, in fact, the weapons that earlier\n\nhad been in their respective custodies.                  We conclude that the\n\nevidence was sufficient to lead a reasonable jury to the same\n\nconclusion; accordingly, the admission of this evidence was not\n\nerroneous.\n\n             B.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           Lugo, but not Cruz, challenges the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence with respect to his drug-trafficking convictions.                      See 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1) (criminalizing possession of narcotics with\n\nintent to distribute); see also 18 U.S.C. § 2 (\"Whoever commits an\n\noffense against the United States or who aids [or] abets . . . its\n\ncommission is punishable as a principal.\").                    Additionally, both\n\nLugo and Cruz argue that there was insufficient evidence to support\n\ntheir   respective         convictions   for     possession    of     a    firearm    in\n\nfurtherance       of   a    drug-trafficking       scheme.          See    18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(c)(1)(A) (providing minimum sentences for such conduct); see\n\nalso Id. § 924(c)(1)(B) (mandating an enhanced sentence if the\n\nfirearm possessed by the individual in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(c)(1)(A) was a machine gun).            We affirm the convictions.\n\n(1) Lugo's Convictions under 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1)\n\n           Lugo contends that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport   the     jury's      findings    that    he   aided    and       abetted    the\n\npossession of cocaine base, heroin, and cocaine.                    Accordingly, he\n\n\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fasks us to set aside his convictions on Counts One, Two, and Three\n\nof the indictment.\n\n             One who aids and abets a crime is punishable as a\n\nprincipal.     See 18 U.S.C. § 2; see also Nye & Nissen v. United\n\nStates, 336 U.S. 613, 618-19 (1949).       Accordingly, we must affirm\n\nLugo's conviction if a reasonable jury could have found beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt both that (1) the principal (here, Cruz) knowingly\n\npossessed and intended to distribute drugs, and that (2) Lugo\n\n\"consciously shared that criminal design, associated himself with\n\nit, and actively sought to ensure its success.\"            United States v.\n\nArias, 238 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2001) (citations and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); see also United States v. Campa, 679 F.2d\n\n1006, 1010 (1st Cir. 1982) (\"The elements that the government was\n\nrequired to prove [to show that appellant aided and abetted the\n\npossession of narcotics] were that appellant associated himself\n\nwith the venture, that he participated in it as something he wished\n\nto bring about, [and] that he sought by his action to make it\n\nsucceed.\" (citations and quotation marks omitted)).               We conclude\n\nthat the evidence was sufficient to prove all elements.\n\n             First, there was ample evidence to support a finding that\n\nCruz   had   possessed    controlled   substances   with    the    intent   to\n\ndistribute.       Agent   Aviles   testified   that,   while       conducting\n\nsurveillance of a known drug area, he had observed an unidentified,\n\nmoney-carrying individual approach a man (later identified as Cruz)\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fwho had a fanny pack strapped across his chest and who appeared\n\n\"ready to receive money.\"           These observations were corroborated –-\n\nindeed, confirmed –- when Agent Sales arrested Cruz and found\n\ndrugs, together with a substantial amount of cash, in a fanny pack\n\non Cruz's person.\n\n               Lugo argues that, \"even if the evidence [was] sufficient\n\nto determine that Cruz possessed controlled substances with the\n\nintent to distribute, the evidence was entirely insufficient to\n\nenable the conclusion that . . . Lugo aided and abetted in that\n\nventure.\"       Specifically, he notes that \"[t]he prosecution simply\n\nfailed    to    overcome    the     presumption    of   innocence    and   produce\n\nevidence that [he] was more than merely present in connection with\n\nany controlled-substance offense.\"             We are not persuaded.\n\n               While \"mere presence at the scene of the crime\" or \"mere\n\nassociation with conspirators\" is not enough to establish guilt,\n\nsee United States v. Gomez-Pabon, 911 F.2d 847, 853 (1st Cir.\n\n1990), \"the mere presence defense is not so ubiquitous as to\n\nenvelop every drug-trafficking case in which the government lacks\n\ndirect evidence of a defendant's complicity.\"              Echeverri, 982 F.2d\n\nat 678.    See also United States v. Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d 319, 324\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (\"Mere presence at the scene and close association\n\nwith those involved are insufficient factors alone; nevertheless,\n\nthey are relevant factors for the jury.\" (quoting United States v.\n\nSanchez,       961   F.2d   1169,    1174   (5th   Cir.   1992))    (emphasis   in\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\foriginal)).   \"As we repeatedly have recognized, a jury is free to\n\nrely on its common sense and may infer that criminal conspirators\n\ndo not involve innocent persons at critical stages of a drug deal.\"\n\nUnited   States    v.   DiMarzo,    80   F.3d   656,   661   (1st   Cir.   1996)\n\n(citations omitted).      \"[S]uch is not normally the conduct that one\n\nwould expect of conspirators engaged in conduct which by its nature\n\nis kept secret from outsiders.\"          United States v. Smith, 680 F.2d\n\n255, 260 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\n           Here, of course, Lugo was more than merely present; the\n\nevidence suggests that he was present for the important purpose of\n\nprotecting the money and the drugs.         See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 678\n\n(\"[A] defendant's 'mere presence' argument will fail in situations\n\nwhere the 'mere' is lacking.\").           See also United States v. Lema,\n\n909 F.2d 561, 570 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[P]resence on a single occasion\n\nmay support a conviction for aiding and abetting if the surrounding\n\ncircumstances lead to a reasonable inference that the defendant\n\nmust have been a knowing participant.\" (citations omitted and\n\nemphasis added)).       For example, two separate officers testified\n\nthat Lugo was carrying a pistol, which, upon seizure, was found to\n\nbe fully loaded with a round of ammunition in its chamber.                    In\n\naddition, Lugo was observed assisting Cruz and Gonzalez in the\n\nconcealment   of    the   weapons    contained     within    the    pillowcase.\n\nMoreover, all of these events were occurring in a known drug\n\narea –- an area that Lugo promptly fled once police arrived -- and\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fthere is nothing in the record to suggest that any of these weapons\n\nwere present for any other reason except to protect Cruz in the\n\nevent that the upcoming drug deals turned sour. Such evidence (and\n\nthe lack of an alternative explanation), coupled with the fact that\n\nCruz was arrested while carrying various drugs and a substantial\n\namount of cash, could lead a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that Lugo associated himself with Cruz's illegal\n\nventure, that he knowingly participated in it, and that, through\n\nhis actions, he actively sought to protect Cruz and thereby help to\n\nensure the success of the operation.\n\n          Nor are we persuaded by the argument that, because Agent\n\nAviles failed to testify that Lugo had been present during the\n\nalleged drug exchange, the jury had no evidence on which to base\n\nits inference that Lugo knew about Cruz's illegal behavior.     While\n\nsuch testimony would have been helpful in proving that Lugo had\n\naided and abetted Cruz, it was not, as discussed above, the only\n\nmechanism through which the government could prove that Lugo had\n\nthe requisite knowledge.\n\n(2) Defendants' Convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)\n\n          Finally, we consider whether the evidence was sufficient\n\nto support the jury's findings that, on October 15, 2001, the\n\ndefendants   possessed   firearms,    including   machine   guns,   in\n\nfurtherance of a drug-trafficking scheme.\n\n\n\n\n                               -18-\n\f           The applicable criminal statute provides that\n\n           (A) . . . any person who, during and in\n           relation to any . . . drug trafficking crime\n           . . . uses or carries a firearm, or who, in\n           furtherance of any such crime, possesses a\n           firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment\n           provided for such . . . drug trafficking crime\n           [be sentenced according to this subsection].\n\n           (B) If the firearm possessed by a person\n           convicted    of   a    violation   of   this\n           subsection . . . is a machine gun . . ., the\n           person shall be sentenced to a term of\n           imprisonment of not less than 30 years.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1); see also 18 U.S.C. § 2.\n\n           Due to the thirty-year prison term mandated by 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(c)(1)(B), both appeals focus primarily on the government's\n\nmachine-gun evidence. However, given additional evidence that Lugo\n\nwas carrying a pistol on his waistline, the machine guns are only\n\none   variable   in   Lugo's   18   U.S.C.   §   924(c)(1)(A)   equation.11\n\nApplying the statutory language to his particular appeal, then, we\n\nmust affirm the conviction if the evidence was sufficient to\n\nsupport a finding that Lugo knowingly possessed (or aided and\n\nabetted the possession of) either a sidearm weapon in furtherance\n\nof the drug-trafficking scheme or a machine gun in furtherance of\n\nthe drug-trafficking scheme.         The propriety of the thirty-year\n\n\n\n\n      11\n      Cruz was not charged with possession of the pistol that\nallegedly was worn on his waistline and later discarded.\nAccordingly, his sufficiency challenge concerns only those weapons\nfound in the pillowcase.\n\n                                    -19-\n\fprison sentences depend, of course, exclusively on the sufficiency\n\nof the machine-gun evidence.\n\n          Regarding the sidearm evidence, Lugo was seen carrying a\n\npistol by two separate officers.            First, Agent Aviles testified\n\nthat, when he arrived on the scene, he noticed that Lugo \"had a\n\nblack pistol [on his waistline].\"           Second, Agent Mendez testified\n\nthat, during     her   struggle    inside    The   Pub   with   Gonzalez,   she\n\nobserved Lugo \"placing a black pistol in between the bottle rack\n\nand the bar.\"    This black pistol was subsequently seized by police\n\nand ultimately admitted into evidence through the authentication\n\ntestimony of Agent Mendez.        Based on this evidence, then, we have\n\nno difficulty concluding that Lugo possessed a pistol.\n\n          Of     course,   given    the     text   of    the statute, merely\n\ndetermining that Lugo was in possession of a sidearm is not enough\n\nto support the conviction; we must also consider whether the weapon\n\nwas possessed \"in furtherance of . . . a drug-trafficking crime.\"\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added).               The jury reasonably\n\nconcluded that it was.\n\n            We    have   recently   explained      the   \"in-furtherance-of\"\n\nrequirement:\n\n          When guns and drugs are found together and a\n          defendant has been convicted of possession\n          with intent to distribute, the gun, whether\n          kept for protection from robbery of drug-sale\n          proceeds, or to enforce payment for drugs, may\n          reasonably be considered to be possessed 'in\n          furtherance of' an ongoing drug-trafficking\n          crime.\n\n                                    -20-\n\fUnited States v. Garner, 338 F.3d 78, 81 (1st Cir. 2003); see also\n\nUnited States v. Luciano, 329 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"Given the\n\nclose proximity of the firearms and the loaded magazines to the\n\nsignificant stockpile of heroin, we have no difficulty concluding\n\nthat there was a sufficient nexus between the drug trafficking\n\ncrime and the firearms to sustain a conviction under [18 U.S.C.]\n\n§ 924.\"); cf. United States v. Ceballos-Torres, 218 F.3d 409, 415\n\n(5th Cir. 2000) (\"Together, [factors such as the type of drug\n\nactivity that is being conducted, accessibility of the firearm, the\n\ntype of the weapon, whether the weapon is stolen, the status of the\n\npossession, whether the gun is loaded, proximity to drugs or drug\n\nprofits, and the time and circumstances under which the gun is\n\nfound] reasonably support a finding that [the firearms] protected\n\nhis drugs and money against robbery.         Possession of the [firearms]\n\nwas, therefore, in furtherance of drug trafficking.\").\n\n             Here, while Lugo's weapon was not found \"together\" with\n\nthe drugs in a literal sense, the jury had reason to conclude that\n\nLugo's sidearm was possessed in furtherance of the drug-trafficking\n\nscheme:     the   weapon   was   loaded,    easily   accessible,   in   close\n\nproximity to the drugs, and its bearer was standing near a drug-\n\ncarrying individual in a known drug area.            There is nothing in the\n\nrecord to suggest that the firearm served any other purpose, and we\n\nare   not   persuaded      by   Lugo's   \"mere   presence\"   defense.     See\n\ndiscussion in II. B.(1), above.\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\f          Because we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport a finding that Lugo possessed a sidearm in furtherance of\n\na drug-trafficking scheme, see 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), we will\n\nnot set aside his conviction on Count Five. Accordingly, regarding\n\nLugo, the machine-gun issue is relevant to Count Five only insofar\n\nas proper sentencing is concerned.      See 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(B).\n\n          Both   Lugo   and   Cruz   contend   that   the   evidence   was\n\ninsufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they had\n\n(either actively or constructively) possessed a machine gun in\n\nfurtherance of the drug-trafficking scheme.       We disagree.\n\n          Although there was no evidence that Cruz or Lugo had \"any\n\ndirect or actual possessory interest\" in the machine guns that were\n\ncontained within –- and protruding from –- the pillowcase, see\n\nUnited States v. Torres-Maldonado, 14 F.3d 95, 102 (1st Cir. 1994),\n\nthe jury, having been properly instructed, could have concluded\n\nthat the defendants had constructive possession of the machine\n\nguns.\n\n          \"Constructive possession exists when a person 'knowingly\n\nhas the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion\n\nand control over an object either directly or through others.'\"\n\nId. (quoting United States v. Garcia, 983 F.2d 1160, 1164 (1st Cir.\n\n1993)); see also United States v. Akinola, 985 F.2d 1105, 1109 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (\"Constructive possession may be proved by demonstrating\n\ndefendant's power and intent to exercise ownership, dominion, or\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fcontrol over the contraband itself, or over the area in which the\n\ncontraband was concealed.     Constructive possession may be sole or\n\njoint and may be achieved directly or through others.\" (citations\n\nomitted)).\n\n             In this case, the jury had before it Agent Aviles'\n\ntestimony that, after Gonzalez had disappeared behind a building\n\nand reappeared carrying a pillowcase from which rifle barrels were\n\nprotruding, Cruz and Lugo assisted Gonzalez in \"cover[ing] the long\n\nweapons\" with a blanket.    In addition, there was evidence that all\n\nof this activity had occurred within a known drug area, that all\n\nparties had been armed with pistols, that an unknown party had\n\narrived on the scene with money in his hand, and that Cruz had been\n\narrested with drugs and a substantial amount of cash on his person.\n\n             Assuming, as we must, the veracity of this evidence, the\n\njury was free to infer that the loaded \"long weapons\" had been\n\nconcealed within the garbage can as an added security measure.\n\nThere is nothing in the record to suggest that these firearms were\n\nthemselves for sale or that they served any purposes other than\n\nincreased protection and peace of mind.       Accordingly, the jury\n\ncould have concluded that Cruz and Lugo had the power and intention\n\nto retrieve the firearms if and when the upcoming drug transactions\n\nturned sour; that is, the defendants constructively possessed the\n\nmachine guns in furtherance of the drug-trafficking scheme.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\f            We acknowledge that the jury's inferences of guilt are\n\nnot inevitable and that the sufficiency questions are arguably\n\nclose.   However,\n\n            an appellate court plays a very circumscribed\n            role in gauging the sufficiency of the\n            evidentiary foundation upon which a criminal\n            conviction rests.      The court of appeals\n            neither   weighs   the   credibility   of the\n            witnesses nor attempts to assess whether the\n            prosecution succeeded in eliminating every\n            possible    theory    consistent    with  the\n            defendant's innocence.\n\nUnited States v. Noah, 130 F.3d 490, 494 (1st Cir. 1997) (citation\n\nomitted).

So too here.\n\n                                III.\n\n            For the reasons stated above, we affirm the convictions\n\nof both defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                                -24-\n\f",

Agent Aviles immediately focused his attention on three individuals &#8212; later identified as Lugo, Cruz, and Jose Gonzalez Bernard &#8212; standing 40 feet away from him, outside a bar known as \"The Pub.\" Each man was carrying a firearm on his waistline; in addition, Cruz had a \"fanny pack\" strapped across his chest and appeared \"ready to receive money from some person.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agent Aviles next observed an unidentified man, who was carrying money, approach Cruz from an unidentified vehicle that had just arrived on the scene. After encountering Cruz, the individual returned to his vehicle and drove away. The substance of this meeting &#8212; namely, whether there had been an actual exchange of drugs or money &#8212; was not witnessed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At one point during his surveillance, Agent Aviles saw Gonzalez disappear around the side of The Pub; when Gonzalez reappeared, he and another unidentified individual were carrying a pillowcase that had rifle barrels protruding from it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> These men then lifted the pillowcase, placed it into a nearby garbage can, and, with the assistance of Lugo and Cruz, covered it with a blanket and some trash. After witnessing these activities, Agent Aviles immediately called for backup.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the reinforcement agents arrived three to four minutes later, backup Agent Luis Sales Morales noticed that Cruz was carrying a pistol on his waistline. During an ensuing chase, Agent Sales saw Cruz toss his firearm into an overgrown lot. Although the handgun was never recovered, Cruz was eventually arrested as he tried to scale a fence. At the time of his arrest, Cruz was carrying a nine-millimeter magazine, $526 cash, and a fanny pack (strapped across his chest) containing substances that later tested positive for cocaine base, heroin, and cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, backup Agent Nancy Mendez was pursuing Gonzalez. When she caught him just outside The Pub, Gonzalez attempted to draw his weapon. In response, Agent Mendez grabbed his arm and was dragged inside The Pub. There, during her struggle with Gonzalez, she observed Lugo for the first time; he was standing behind the bar with a gun in his hand. Agent Aviles testified as to how and when Lugo had entered The Pub: \"I saw Mendez who was going to arrest the defendants, and they started running. At that moment, I started running, following her. So she went into [The Pub] after, going after the defendants.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez eventually surrendered and was taken outside The Pub and arrested.

Neither is convincing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, contrary to Lugo's assertion, the government did, in fact, present evidence sufficient to support a finding that Agent Aviles had the requisite personal knowledge of the area's history. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 602 (\"A witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter. Evidence to prove personal knowledge may, but need not, consist of the witness' own testimony.\"). Specifically, Agent Aviles testified that he had been a member of the Drugs and Narcotics Division of the Puerto Rico Police Department for approximately six years, that he had been involved with approximately 80 or 90 investigations involving drug points, that he knew of other agents who had made drug arrests outside The Pub, and that he himself had previously arrested an individual on drug charges outside The Pub.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> In addition, three other agents provided corroborating testimony that the area in front of The Pub was known within the police department to be a drug point. Given the testimony of these four witnesses, the district court acted well within its discretion in determining that there was an adequate foundation for Agent Aviles' testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next consider whether the district court abused its discretion in determining that the drug-point testimony was not unduly prejudicial. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403 (\"Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of <i>unfair</i> prejudice....\" (emphasis added)); <i>see also United States v. Pitrone,</i> 115 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1997) (\"Virtually all evidence is prejudicial &#8212; if the truth be told, that is almost always why the proponent seeks to introduce it &#8212; but it is only <i>unfair</i> prejudice against which the law protects.\" (emphasis retained)). According to Lugo, this testimony \"allowed [the jury] to infer impermissibly that[,] because Mr. Lugo was arrested at a `point,' he must have been involved in the drug trade there.\" \"Only rarely &#8212; and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances &#8212; will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" <i>Freeman v. Package Machinery Co.,</i> 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir.1988). This is not such a circumstance. Here, the drug-point testimony was probative not only to explain Agent Aviles' presence at the scene but also to corroborate the inference that Cruz and Lugo were involved in a drug-trafficking scheme &#8212; a scheme that would be independently suggested by other evidence. So understood, the district court could have concluded that the prejudice caused by such testimony was not unfair; it was, instead, merely the negative result of the testimony's probative value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The Machine Guns</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lugo next argues that the two machine guns were not properly authenticated, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 901(a), and thus should not have been admitted into evidence.

First, Agent Aviles testified to the following chronology: (1) immediately following the arrests, he himself seized the pillowcase from the garbage can; (2) the pillowcase's contents, including two Romanian Arms rifles, were then taken to police headquarters; (3) Agent Aviles next phoned Agent Rios from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and requested that Rios travel to headquarters to take possession of the weapons; and (4) the weapons remained in his custody until Agent Rios arrived. Second, Agent Rios testified (1) that, upon arriving at police headquarters on October 15, 2001, he prepared a property receipt (describing the contents of the pillowcase), which both he and Aviles signed; (2) that he thereafter took possession of the weapons; (3) that, two days later, on October 17, 2001, he prepared a property-inventory form, on which the seized weapons were listed; and (4) that the weapons remained in his custody from October 15th through October 17th. Both men testified that the weapons sought to be introduced at trial were, in fact, the weapons that earlier had been in their respective custodies. We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to lead a reasonable jury to the same conclusion; accordingly, the admission of this evidence was not erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lugo, but not Cruz, challenges the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to his drug-trafficking convictions. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) (criminalizing possession of narcotics with intent to distribute); <i>see also</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2 (\"Whoever commits an offense against the United States or who aids [or] abets ... its commission is punishable as a principal.\"). Additionally, both Lugo and Cruz argue that there was insufficient evidence to support their respective convictions for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking scheme. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A) (providing minimum sentences for such conduct); <i>see also Id.</i> &#167; 924(c)(1)(B) (mandating an enhanced sentence if the firearm possessed by the individual in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A) was a machine gun).

Accordingly, he asks us to set aside his convictions on Counts One, Two, and Three of the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One who aids and abets a crime is punishable as a principal. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2; <i>see also Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States,</i> 336 U.S. 613, 618-19, 69 S.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed. 919 (1949). Accordingly, we must affirm Lugo's conviction if a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt both that (1) the principal (here, Cruz) knowingly possessed and intended to distribute drugs, and that (2) Lugo \"consciously shared that criminal design, associated himself with it, and actively sought to ensure its success.\" <i>United States v. Arias,</i> 238 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.2001) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also United States v. Campa,</i> 679 F.2d 1006, 1010 (1st Cir.1982) (\"The elements that the government was required to prove [to show that appellant aided and abetted the possession of narcotics] were that appellant associated himself with the venture, that he participated in it as something he wished to bring about, [and] that he sought by his action to make it succeed.\" (citations and quotation marks omitted)). We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to prove all elements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, there was ample evidence to support a finding that Cruz had possessed controlled substances with the intent to distribute. Agent Aviles testified that, while conducting surveillance of a known drug area, he had observed an unidentified, money-carrying individual approach a man (later identified as Cruz) who had a fanny pack strapped across his chest and who appeared \"ready to receive money.\" These observations were corroborated &#8212; indeed, confirmed &#8212; when Agent Sales arrested Cruz and found drugs, together with a substantial amount of cash, in a fanny pack on Cruz's person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lugo argues that, \"even if the evidence [was] sufficient to determine that Cruz possessed controlled substances with the intent to distribute, the evidence was entirely insufficient to enable the conclusion that ... Lugo aided and abetted in that venture.\" Specifically, he notes that \"[t]he prosecution simply failed to overcome the presumption of innocence and produce evidence that [he] was more than merely present in connection with any controlled-substance offense.\" We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While \"mere presence at the scene of the crime\" or \"mere association with conspirators\" is not enough to establish guilt, <i>see United States v. Gomez-Pabon,</i> 911 F.2d 847, 853 (1st Cir.1990), \"the mere presence defense is not so ubiquitous as to envelop every drug-trafficking case in which the government lacks direct evidence of a defendant's complicity.\" <i>Echeverri,</i> 982 F.2d at 678. <i>See also United</i> <i>States v. Flores-Rivera,</i> 56 F.3d 319, 324 (1st Cir.1995) (\"Mere presence at the scene and close association with those involved are insufficient factors alone; nevertheless, they are <i>relevant</i> factors for the jury.\" (quoting <i>United States v. Sanchez,</i> 961 F.2d 1169, 1174 (5th Cir.1992)) (emphasis in original)). \"As we repeatedly have recognized, a jury is free to rely on its common sense and may infer that criminal conspirators do not involve innocent persons at critical stages of a drug deal.\" <i>United States v. DiMarzo,</i> 80 F.3d 656, 661 (1st Cir.1996) (citations omitted). \"[S]uch is not normally the conduct that one would expect of conspirators engaged in conduct which by its nature is kept secret from outsiders.\" <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 680 F.2d 255, 260 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, of course, Lugo was more than merely present; the evidence suggests that he was present for the important purpose of protecting the money and the drugs. <i>See Echeverri,</i> 982 F.2d at 678 (\"[A] defendant's `mere presence' argument will fail in situations where the `mere' is lacking.\"). <i>See also United States v. Lema,</i> 909 F.2d 561, 570 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[P]resence on a single occasion may support a conviction for aiding and abetting if the surrounding circumstances lead to a reasonable inference that the defendant must have been a <i>knowing</i> participant.\" (citations omitted and emphasis added)). For example, two separate officers testified that Lugo was carrying a pistol, which, upon seizure, was found to be fully loaded with a round of ammunition in its chamber. In addition, Lugo was observed assisting Cruz and Gonzalez in the concealment of the weapons contained within the pillowcase. Moreover, all of these events were occurring in a known drug area &#8212; an area that Lugo promptly fled once police arrived &#8212; and there is nothing in the record to suggest that any of these weapons were present for any other reason except to protect Cruz in the event that the upcoming drug deals turned sour. Such evidence (and the lack of an alternative explanation), coupled with the fact that Cruz was arrested while carrying various drugs and a substantial amount of cash, could lead a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Lugo associated himself with Cruz's illegal venture, that he knowingly participated in it, and that, through his actions, he actively sought to protect Cruz and thereby help to ensure the success of the operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor are we persuaded by the argument that, because Agent Aviles failed to testify that Lugo had been present during the alleged drug exchange, the jury had no evidence on which to base its inference that Lugo knew about Cruz's illegal behavior. While such testimony would have been helpful in proving that Lugo had aided and abetted Cruz, it was not, as discussed above, the only mechanism through which the government could prove that Lugo had the requisite knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Defendants' Convictions under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we consider whether the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's findings that, on October 15, 2001, the defendants possessed firearms, including machine guns, in furtherance of a drug-trafficking scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The applicable criminal statute provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) ... any person who, during and in relation to any ... drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such ... drug trafficking crime [be sentenced according to this subsection].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) If the firearm possessed by a person convicted of a violation of this subsection... is a machine gun ..., the person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 30 years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1); <i>see also</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Due to the thirty-year prison term mandated by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(B), both appeals focus primarily on the government's machine-gun evidence.

B.(1), above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that Lugo possessed a sidearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking scheme, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A), we will not set aside his conviction on Count Five. Accordingly, regarding Lugo, the machine-gun issue is relevant to Count Five only insofar as proper sentencing is concerned. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Lugo and Cruz contend that the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they had (either actively or constructively) possessed a machine gun in furtherance of the drug-trafficking scheme. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although there was no evidence that Cruz or Lugo had \"any direct or actual possessory interest\" in the machine guns that were contained within &#8212; and protruding from &#8212; the pillowcase, <i>see United States v. Torres-Maldonado,</i> 14 F.3d 95, 102 (1st Cir.1994), the jury, having been properly instructed, could have concluded that the defendants had constructive possession of the machine guns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Constructive possession exists when a person `knowingly has the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion and control over an object either directly or through others.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v.

In addition, there was evidence that all of this activity had occurred within a known drug area, that all parties had been armed with pistols, that an unknown party had arrived on the scene with money in his hand, and that Cruz had been arrested with drugs and a substantial amount of cash on his person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming, as we must, the veracity of this evidence, the jury was free to infer that the loaded \"long weapons\" had been concealed within the garbage can as an added security measure. There is nothing in the record to suggest that these firearms were themselves for sale or that they served any purposes other than increased protection and peace of mind. Accordingly, the jury could have concluded that Cruz and Lugo had the power and intention to retrieve the firearms if and when the upcoming drug transactions turned sour; that is, the defendants constructively possessed the machine guns in furtherance of the drug-trafficking scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that the jury's inferences of guilt are not inevitable and that the sufficiency questions are arguably close.

Agent Aviles immediately focused his attention on three individuals &#8212; later identified as Lugo, Cruz, and Jose Gonzalez Bernard &#8212; standing 40 feet away from him, outside a bar known as \"The Pub.\" Each man was carrying a firearm on his waistline; in addition, Cruz had a \"fanny pack\" strapped across his chest and appeared \"ready to receive money from some person.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agent Aviles next observed an unidentified man, who was carrying money, approach Cruz from an unidentified vehicle that had just arrived on the scene. After encountering Cruz, the individual returned to his vehicle and drove away. The substance of this meeting &#8212; namely, whether there had been an actual exchange of drugs or money &#8212; was not witnessed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At one point during his surveillance, Agent Aviles saw Gonzalez disappear around the side of The Pub; when Gonzalez reappeared, he and another unidentified individual were carrying a pillowcase that had rifle barrels protruding from it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> These men then lifted the pillowcase, placed it into a nearby garbage can, and, with the assistance of Lugo and Cruz, covered it with a blanket and some trash. After witnessing these activities, Agent Aviles immediately called for backup.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the reinforcement agents arrived three to four minutes later, backup Agent Luis Sales Morales noticed that Cruz was carrying a pistol on his waistline. During an ensuing chase, Agent Sales saw Cruz toss his firearm into an overgrown lot. Although the handgun was never recovered, Cruz was eventually arrested as he tried to scale a fence. At the time of his arrest, Cruz was carrying a nine-millimeter magazine, $526 cash, and a fanny pack (strapped across his chest) containing substances that later tested positive for cocaine base, heroin, and cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, backup Agent Nancy Mendez was pursuing Gonzalez. When she caught him just outside The Pub, Gonzalez attempted to draw his weapon. In response, Agent Mendez grabbed his arm and was dragged inside The Pub. There, during her struggle with Gonzalez, she observed Lugo for the first time; he was standing behind the bar with a gun in his hand. Agent Aviles testified as to how and when Lugo had entered The Pub: \"I saw Mendez who was going to arrest the defendants, and they started running. At that moment, I started running, following her. So she went into [The Pub] after, going after the defendants.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez eventually surrendered and was taken outside The Pub and arrested. Once outside, Agent Mendez told another agent to go inside The Pub, arrest Lugo, and seize the firearm that she had seen him conceal between a bottle rack and the bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lugo was arrested without incident.

Inside the pillowcase were two Romanian Arms rifles that, as an expert witness later testified, had been converted into machine guns, as well as an arsenal rifle, a pistol, and large amounts of ammunition.

Specifically, Agent Aviles testified that he had been a member of the Drugs and Narcotics Division of the Puerto Rico Police Department for approximately six years, that he had been involved with approximately 80 or 90 investigations involving drug points, that he knew of other agents who had made drug arrests outside The Pub, and that he himself had previously arrested an individual on drug charges outside The Pub.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> In addition, three other agents provided corroborating testimony that the area in front of The Pub was known within the police department to be a drug point.

According to Lugo, this testimony \"allowed [the jury] to infer impermissibly that[,] because Mr. Lugo was arrested at a `point,' he must have been involved in the drug trade there.\" \"Only rarely &#8212; and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances &#8212; will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" <i>Freeman v.

Accordingly, the jury could have concluded that Cruz and Lugo had the power and intention to retrieve the firearms if and when the upcoming drug transactions turned sour; that is, the defendants constructively possessed the machine guns in furtherance of the drug-trafficking scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that the jury's inferences of guilt are not inevitable and that the sufficiency questions are arguably close. However,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">an appellate court plays a very circumscribed role in gauging the sufficiency of the evidentiary foundation upon which a criminal conviction rests.
