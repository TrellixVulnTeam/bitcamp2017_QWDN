Petitioner Jimmy Teja seeks review of a\n\nfinal order of removal issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(BIA).    Teja's sole appeal is from the BIA's denial of political\n\nasylum.   He has not argued error in the Board's affirmation of the\n\nImmigration Judge's (IJ) denial of withholding of removal and\n\nrelief under the Convention Against Torture, and thus has waived\n\nthose issues.    The BIA affirmed the IJ's conclusion that, although\n\nthe petitioner was credible, he had failed to establish an asylum\n\nclaim based on past persecution or a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.    We now affirm the BIA's decision.\n\n           Teja, a native and citizen of Indonesia, is ethnic\n\nChinese and a practicing Christian.    He entered the United States\n\nwith a valid tourist visa on May 28, 2001, and applied for\n\npolitical asylum on May 30, 2002.1     In this petition for review,\n\nTeja argues that he qualifies for asylum because he has suffered\n\npast persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution\n\non account of his religious affiliation and his status as an ethnic\n\nChinese minority.\n\n     The IJ found Teja credible.       We relate the facts as he\n\ntestified to them. Teja stated that he suffered discrimination and\n\nharassment from a young age because he is ethnic Chinese and\n\nChristian.     In high school, a classmate demanded money from him,\n\n\n     1\n      The IJ deemed the application timely because the government,\nat trial, waived any objection to the applicant's failure to file\nfor asylum within one year of entry.\n\n                                 -2-\n\fassuming that as an ethnic Chinese he was wealthy.     When Teja did\n\nnot respond favorably to the demand, the classmate beat him and\n\nthreatened to kill him if he reported it.      Before Teja commenced\n\nhis university studies, he changed his name from Kok Liang The, his\n\ngiven Chinese name, in order to avoid future problems.\n\n     On May 14, 1998, Teja’s uncle, a bill collector, was attacked\n\nby a mob, apparently because they thought he was ethnic Chinese.\n\nHe was beaten severely and then set on fire, using gasoline from\n\nhis motorcycle.     As a result of this incident, Teja's uncle was\n\npermanently disabled.     The incident took place during widespread\n\nmob violence against ethnic Chinese in Indonesia in 1998.     In his\n\ntestimony, Teja acknowledged that he was not present during the\n\nattack and at that time lived about 25 kilometers away from his\n\nuncle.\n\n     On February 10, 2001, four days after Teja held a Bible study\n\nsession at his home, a group of Muslim neighbors attacked the\n\nhouse.    They threw stones at the building and were armed with sharp\n\nknives.    Teja’s wife was at home alone at the time and called Teja\n\nat work and also summoned the authorities, who protected the house\n\nfrom the mob.    Teja's neighbors later told him that they attacked\n\nthe house because they did not like that he held Bible study there.\n\nHe testified that neighbors continued to watch the house and as a\n\nresult, he stopped holding Bible study at his home.        Teja left\n\nIndonesia for the United States four months after this attack.\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f     Teja’s wife and two children continue to live in the same home\n\nin Indonesia and attend church weekly, apparently without incident.\n\nTeja's testimony was unclear as to whether his family's house has\n\nbeen attacked since he left Indonesia.2           Teja also testified that\n\nhis eight-year-old daughter was threatened by a passerby, who told\n\nher \"hey your [sic] Chinese, tell your father you'll be killed.\"\n\n     In addition to Teja's testimony, the administrative record\n\nprovides significant evidence of the 1998 violence against ethnic\n\nChinese.      However, the record also shows that a similar flare-up\n\nhas not occurred since then.          Indeed, the 2004 State Department\n\nCountry     Report   on   Indonesia   notes   a   decline   in   instances   of\n\ndiscrimination and harassment of ethnic Chinese over the previous\n\nyear.       The 2003 Country Report notes a sharp drop in violence\n\n\n\n        2\n       Teja initially testified that his family's home had come\nunder frequent attack since the initial incident:\n     Q: After February 10th, 2001 did that type of things [sic]\n(indiscernible) stoning at your house ever happen again?\n     A: Yes.\n     Q: How many more times did that happen again?\n     A: Often and the last one my wife told me that they also\nthrew feces at my house.\n     However, later in his testimony, Teja gave a different\nresponse:\n     Q: Did they have any problems after you left for America?\n     A:   They've never had any problems but my wife is always\nscared and their [sic] always scared until now.\n     Q: What are they scared of?\n     A: That the vandalism of my house happens again.\n     The immigration judge, in her findings of fact, did not\nmention Teja's statements about subsequent attacks or the feces\nallegation, concluding instead that \"Apart from [the passer-by's\nstatement to his daughter], they do not appear to have had any\ndifficulty [since the 2001 incident].\"\n\n                                      -4-\n\fbetween Christians and Muslims.       The 2004 Country Report does note\n\ncontinuing violence between Christians and Muslims in the eastern\n\nprovinces of Central Sulawesi, Maluku, and North Maluku, areas\n\nwhere Teja does not live.\n\n     The IJ found Teja credible but ruled that he did not qualify\n\nfor asylum based on past persecution or a reasonable fear of future\n\npersecution.    The BIA affirmed, finding insufficient evidence of\n\npast persecution, and a lack of a reasonable fear of future\n\npersecution, or a pattern or practice of persecution against\n\nChristians and/or ethnic Chinese.\n\n     This court reviews BIA decisions regarding asylum eligibility\n\nfor substantial evidence; we must accept the BIA's findings of fact\n\nif they are supported by \"reasonable, substantial, and probative\n\nevidence on the record considered as a whole.\" Bocova v. Gonzales,\n\n412 F.3d 257, 262 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias,\n\n502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992)). We will reverse only if \"any reasonable\n\nadjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\"               8\n\nU.S.C.   §   1252(b)(4)(B).    A     petitioner     bears   the   burden   of\n\nestablishing    eligibility   for    asylum   \"by   proving   either   past\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution,\" on account of\n\nhis race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.        Velasquez v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 55,\n\n58 (1st Cir. 2003).   A well-founded fear of future persecution can\n\nbe shown in either of two ways.       First, the petitioner may show a\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fgenuine subjective fear of persecution, along with \"credible,\n\ndirect, and specific evidence\" that would objectively support a\n\nreasonable fear of future individualized persecution.     Guzman v.\n\nINS, 327 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Ravindran v. INS, 976\n\nF.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir. 1992)).       Second, a petitioner need not\n\nprovide evidence that he would be singled out for persecution if he\n\nestablishes that there is \"a pattern or practice in his or her\n\ncountry of nationality . . . of persecution of a group of persons\n\nsimilarly situated to the applicant on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\"   8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(2)(iii)(A).\n\n     In contesting the BIA's determination, Teja asserts that he\n\nhas suffered past persecution and has a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution; he puts particular emphasis on his claim of a pattern\n\nor practice of persecution.      We do not find these arguments\n\npersuasive. First, the evidence does not compel a reasonable fact-\n\nfinder to conclude that Teja suffered past persecution.        Past\n\npersecution is more than \"unpleasantness, harassment, and even\n\nbasic suffering.\"    Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir.\n\n2000); see also Susanto v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 57 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(past persecution not shown where home of ethnic Chinese Indonesian\n\nwas vandalized and Muslims threw stones at petitioner and fellow\n\nChristian worshipers).   Here, the harms experienced by Teja are\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\finsufficiently severe to compel the conclusion that he has suffered\n\npast persecution.\n\n     Second, a reasonable fact-finder would not be compelled to\n\nconclude that Teja has an objectively reasonable fear of future\n\npersecution.     Such a fear is shown where \"a reasonable person in\n\nthe petitioner's circumstances would fear persecution based on a\n\nstatutorily protected ground.\"           Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d\n\n115, 122 (1st Cir. 2005).            In similar asylum claims brought by\n\nethnic Chinese Christians, this court has held that where the\n\napplicant's family members continue to reside in Indonesia without\n\nsuffering     persecution     and    where   Country   Reports    indicate   a\n\nsignificant     decline     in   violence    against   ethnic    Chinese   and\n\nChristians, the applicant has not shown an objective fear of future\n\npersecution.    Id. at 122; Zheng v. Gonzales, 416 F.3d 97, 101 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).     Here, Teja testified that his family continues to\n\nattend church without problems and has, at most, suffered from\n\nprivate hostility and prejudice based on religion and/or ethnicity.\n\nTherefore, he has not shown an objectively reasonable fear of\n\nfuture persecution.\n\n     Third, we do not believe that, on this administrative record,\n\na reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to conclude that ethnic\n\nChinese and/or Christians in Indonesia are subject to a pattern or\n\npractice of persecution.         This court has held that a pattern or\n\npractice    claim   requires     a   showing   of   systematic    persecution\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\ftargeting    a   group   on    account      of   one   of   the   five    protected\n\ncategories.      Meguenine v. INS, 139 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nWhile the record in this case shows that ethnic Chinese and\n\nChristians in Indonesia did suffer harm in 1998 and have continued\n\nto experience sporadic violence and discrimination in certain areas\n\nof   the   country,   the     record   is    not   sufficient     to     compel   the\n\nconclusion that these groups suffer from systematic persecution.\n\nThis is particularly true where the 2004 Country Report notes a\n\ndecline in incidents of discrimination and harassment against\n\nethnic Chinese, and the 2003 Country Report notes a sharp drop in\n\nviolence between Christians and Muslims.\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is denied.\n\nThe decision of the BIA is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f",

INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592069\"><a href=\"/opinion/592069/valli-kandiah-ravindran-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 758 (1st Cir. 1992)).       Second, a petitioner need not\n\nprovide evidence that he would be singled out for persecution if he\n\nestablishes that there is \"a pattern or practice in his or her\n\ncountry of nationality . . . of persecution of a group of persons\n\nsimilarly situated to the applicant on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\"   8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(2)(iii)(A).\n\n     In contesting the BIA's determination, Teja asserts that he\n\nhas suffered past persecution and has a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution; he puts particular emphasis on his claim of a pattern\n\nor practice of persecution.      We do not find these arguments\n\npersuasive. First, the evidence does not compel a reasonable fact-\n\nfinder to conclude that Teja suffered past persecution.        Past\n\npersecution is more than \"unpleasantness, harassment, and even\n\nbasic suffering.\"    Nelson v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771091\"><a href=\"/opinion/771091/laeila-nelson-stephanie-nelson-phil-nelson-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 263 (1st Cir.\n\n2000); see also Susanto v.

Here, the harms experienced by Teja are\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\finsufficiently severe to compel the conclusion that he has suffered\n\npast persecution.\n\n     Second, a reasonable fact-finder would not be compelled to\n\nconclude that Teja has an objectively reasonable fear of future\n\npersecution.     Such a fear is shown where \"a reasonable person in\n\nthe petitioner's circumstances would fear persecution based on a\n\nstatutorily protected ground.\"           Nikijuluw v.

In similar asylum claims brought by\n\nethnic Chinese Christians, this court has held that where the\n\napplicant's family members continue to reside in Indonesia without\n\nsuffering     persecution     and    where   Country   Reports    indicate   a\n\nsignificant     decline     in   violence    against   ethnic    Chinese   and\n\nChristians, the applicant has not shown an objective fear of future\n\npersecution.    Id. at 122; Zheng v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201746\"><a href=\"/opinion/201746/zheng-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 101 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).     Here, Teja testified that his family continues to\n\nattend church without problems and has, at most, suffered from\n\nprivate hostility and prejudice based on religion and/or ethnicity.\n\nTherefore, he has not shown an objectively reasonable fear of\n\nfuture persecution.\n\n     Third, we do not believe that, on this administrative record,\n\na reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to conclude that ethnic\n\nChinese and/or Christians in Indonesia are subject to a pattern or\n\npractice of persecution.         This court has held that a pattern or\n\npractice    claim   requires     a   showing   of   systematic    persecution\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\ftargeting    a   group   on    account      of   one   of   the   five    protected\n\ncategories.
