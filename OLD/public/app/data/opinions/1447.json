Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n              Boudin, Stahl, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Mark J. Favaloro, with whom Favaloro & Associates was on\nbrief, for appellants.\n     Judy A. Levenson, with whom Deidre Brennan Regan and Brody,\nHardoon, Perkins & Kesten, LLP, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              April 9, 2010\n\f          STAHL, Circuit Judge.        Plaintiffs-appellants John and\n\nJudy Palermo (\"the Palermos\") brought an amended complaint against\n\nthe Town of North Reading (\"the Town\") alleging an unconstitutional\n\ntaking of property and violation of their civil rights as protected\n\nby 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act.        The\n\ndistrict court dismissed the complaint in its entirety for failure\n\nto state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n\nThe Palermos only appeal the dismissal of their federal civil\n\nrights   claim   brought   pursuant    to   §   1983.   After   careful\n\nconsideration we affirm.\n\n          In 1987, the Palermos purchased three lots of land in\n\nNorth Reading, Massachusetts, and thereafter, in 1997, sought a\n\nbuilding permit for those lots.        The Town's building inspector\n\ndenied the permit, requiring that construction of the street upon\n\nwhich the lots were located be completed first.          The Palermos\n\nalleged that from 1997 to 2005, the Town allowed other property\n\nowners to develop similar lots on unaccepted streets1 while denying\n\nthem the same ability. In 2004, the Palermos petitioned the Town's\n\nCommunity Planning Commission to build out the adjacent street as\n\nan unaccepted street.      The Town's Planner denied that request,\n\nindicating that \"a complete subdivision plan would be necessary.\"\n\nThe Palermos alleged that this treatment was contrary to the\n\n\n\n     1\n      An unaccepted street is a public right of way that has not\nbeen built to municipal standards.\n\n                                 -2-\n\ftreatment received by other property owners in the Town.       In 2005,\n\nthe Palermos learned that the Town's Board of Selectman had voted\n\nto take their land by eminent domain and that they would be given\n\na pro tanto award of $15,250, an amount that the Palermos believed\n\nwas significantly lower than the market value of the land.\n\n            The Palermos filed suit in state court seeking, among\n\nother things, just compensation for the Town's eminent domain\n\ntaking pursuant to Massachusetts General Law ch. 79.          The Town\n\nremoved the action to federal court and the parties subsequently\n\nfiled a joint motion to stay the federal action and allow the\n\nPalermos to pursue their state law eminent domain claim in state\n\ncourt.   In the state court proceeding, the Town filed a pretrial\n\nmotion stating that it expected its appraiser to testify that the\n\nPalermos'    property   was   either   unbuildable   or     effectively\n\nunbuildable due to significant regulatory and physical hurdles that\n\nwould have to be overcome in order to obtain a building permit on\n\nthe property.   However, at trial, the appraiser testified that the\n\nproperty was buildable and that the market value was $140,000. The\n\njury returned a verdict in favor of the Palermos for $184,000.\n\n            Following the favorable state jury verdict, the Palermos\n\nreturned to federal court and filed a motion to reopen their\n\nfederal action.    The district court was uncertain as to what, if\n\nanything, remained of the case following the jury verdict, and\n\nordered the Palermos to file an amended complaint.        The Palermos'\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\famended   complaint   asserted   two   counts   against   the   Town:   (1)\n\nviolation of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and\n\nArticles X and XII of the Massachusetts Constitution due to an\n\nunconstitutional taking of the Palermos' property; and (2) \"bad\n\nfaith\" by the Town, which allegedly violated the Palermos' civil\n\nrights as protected by 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Massachusetts Civil\n\nRights Act.   Count Two's \"bad faith\" charge was based on the Town's\n\ndenial of the building permit and its offer of a \"de minimis\" pro\n\ntanto award in spite of the appraiser's significantly higher\n\nvaluation.\n\n           Count Two did not state which of the Palermos' civil\n\nrights the Town was alleged to have violated.        In addition, Count\n\nTwo only referred to acts committed by agents and employees of the\n\nTown, rather than acts committed by the Town itself.             Finally,\n\nCount Two contained no allegation that the alleged civil rights\n\nviolations were the result of a policy, practice, or custom of the\n\nTown.\n\n           In response to the amended complaint, the Town filed a\n\nmotion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).     As to the federal civil rights claim\n\nin Count Two, which is the only part of the amended complaint\n\nbefore us on appeal, the Town urged the district court to dismiss\n\non the ground that municipal liability for civil rights claims can\n\nonly rest on actions committed by the municipality itself, not on\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\frespondeat superior or vicarious liability for acts committed by\n\nemployees of the Town.   See Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs. of New\n\nYork, 436 U.S. 658, 694-95 (1978).    Agreeing with the Town that the\n\nPalermos had only alleged wrong-doing by \"the individuals who\n\ndenied the requisite permits to develop the site and who ignored\n\nthe appraiser's opinion to offer a wholly inadequate award,\" rather\n\nthan wrong-doing by the Town itself, the district court dismissed\n\nCount Two in its entirety.2\n\n          On appeal to this court, the Palermos argue that the\n\nmotion to dismiss as to Count Two's federal civil rights claim was\n\nimproperly granted because the Town was the \"moving force\" behind\n\na \"policy, practice, or custom\" of \"tak[ing] certain property of\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The district court put forth a second ground for dismissal of\nCount Two, that the Palermos failed to identify the constitutional\nright(s) that they alleged were violated by the Town. \"[T]he\ncomplaint is unclear, at best, as to which of their constitutional\nrights were violated and what specific conduct of the Town deprived\nplaintiffs of those rights.\" Palermo v. Town of North Reading, No.\n05-11782-RWZ (D. Mass. Nov. 14, 2008) (order granting motion to\ndismiss).\n     In addition, though not relevant to this appeal, we note that\nthe district court dismissed Count One because, \"To the extent the\nplaintiffs continue to complain about the inadequate pro tanto\naward, their procedural due process rights have been fully\nvindicated by the jury trial in which they were heard and the jury\nclearly heard them.\" Id. The district court also noted that \"[I]t\nis difficult . . . to discern the basis for the claim that the\ntaking was unconstitutional and second, to reconcile that claim\nwith plaintiffs' acceptance of the award.\" Id. The Palermos did\nnot appeal from the dismissal of Count One.\n\n                                -5-\n\fits inhabitants by eminent domain through the use of an unlawful\n\nprocess.\"3\n\n             Having conducted a de novo review, TAG/ICIB Servs., Inc.\n\nv. Pan Am. Grain Co., Inc., 215 F.3d 172, 175 (1st Cir. 2000), we\n\nreject the Palermos' arguments on appeal.     The district court was\n\ncorrect to conclude that where municipal civil rights liability\n\nunder § 1983 is premised solely on the actions of municipal\n\nemployees or representatives, as was the case in the Palermos'\n\namended complaint, liability does not attach. See Monell, 436 U.S.\n\nat 694 (\"We conclude, therefore, that a local government may not be\n\nsued under § 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees\n\nor agents.\").\n\n             While it true, as the Palermos argue on appeal, that\n\nmunicipal liability can attach where \"execution of a government's\n\npolicy or custom . . . inflicts the injury,\" id.; see also Jett v.\n\nDallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 491 U.S. 701, 737 (1989), the Palermos\n\nnever made such a Monell claim until their appeal to this court.\n\nThe Palermos did not mention the Town's policy, practice, or custom\n\nin their amended complaint, opposition to defendant's motion to\n\ndismiss, or anywhere else.4      \"It is a bedrock rule that when a\n\n\n     3\n      The Palermos also argue, in response to the district court's\nsecond ground for granting the motion to dismiss on the civil\nrights claim, that the constitutional right violated by the Town\nwas the right to substantive due process.\n     4\n      Indeed, the amended complaint is premised on the notion that\nthe Palermos were treated differently than other property owners in\n\n                                  -6-\n\fparty has not presented an argument to the district court, she may\n\nnot unveil it in the court of appeals.\"    United States v. Slade,\n\n980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 1992).   We decline the Palermos' request\n\nto read their amended complaint so as to discover a claim that they\n\nsimply did not make.5\n\n          We therefore affirm the district court's dismissal of the\n\nPalermos' federal civil rights claim against the Town.\n\n\n\n\nthe Town, rather than the same as many other property owners as\npart of the Town's policy, practice, or custom.       The Palermos\nasserted at oral argument that Paragraph 26 of the amended\ncomplaint raised a sufficient Monell claim for purposes of a motion\nto dismiss. That paragraph alleged that \"the actions, decisions,\nand policies\" of the Town \"deprived the Plaintiffs of all\neconomically beneficial use of the Premises.\"      Under Bell Atl.\nCorp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007), this allegation is not\nnearly sufficient to support a Monell claim because the complaint\nas a whole contained no factual assertions whatsoever regarding\nTown policy. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009)\n(\"To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain\nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to\nrelief that is plausible on its face.'\") (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S.\nat 570).    As noted above, the factual premise of the amended\ncomplaint was that the Palermos had been treated differently from\nother property owners, not similarly in accordance with Town\npolicy.\n     5\n      In addition, the Palermos make a brief argument that the\nfederal constitutional injury they suffered was the violation of\ntheir right to substantive due process. This alleged injury was\nnot included in their amended complaint and we will not consider it\nhere for the first time. Slade, 980 F.2d at 30. We agree with the\ndistrict court that the Palermos failed to specify the\nconstitutional right upon which their § 1983 claim was premised.\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

That paragraph alleged that \"the actions, decisions,\nand policies\" of the Town \"deprived the Plaintiffs of all\neconomically beneficial use of the Premises.\"      Under Bell Atl.\nCorp. v. Twombly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 555 (2007), this allegation is not\nnearly sufficient to support a Monell claim because the complaint\nas a whole contained no factual assertions whatsoever regarding\nTown policy. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145875\"><a href=\"/opinion/145875/ashcroft-v-iqbal/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As noted above, the factual premise of the amended\ncomplaint was that the Palermos had been treated differently from\nother property owners, not similarly in accordance with Town\npolicy.\n     5\n      In addition, the Palermos make a brief argument that the\nfederal constitutional injury they suffered was the violation of\ntheir right to substantive due process. This alleged injury was\nnot included in their amended complaint and we will not consider it\nhere for the first time. Slade, 980 F.2d at 30. We agree with the\ndistrict court that the Palermos failed to specify the\nconstitutional right upon which their § 1983 claim was premised.\n\n                               -7-\n\f</pre>",
