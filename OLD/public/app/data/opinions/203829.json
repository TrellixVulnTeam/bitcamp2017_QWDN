These appeals arise out of a freak\n\naccident that occurred on April 25, 2005, at a post office in\n\nBoqueron,   Puerto   Rico.     On   that   date,   two   unrelated   parties\n\n(plaintiffs Lucy Fothergill and Cruz Teresa del Toro Pineiro)\n\nhappened to be inside the facility.            Each woman was bent on\n\ntransacting routine business.\n\n            In the same time frame, another postal customer was\n\nmaneuvering her car in the parking lot. That customer accidentally\n\ndrove her vehicle through the front entrance of the building and\n\ninto its public area.        Both plaintiffs sustained injuries as a\n\nresult of the mishap.\n\n            After    complying      with    applicable      administrative\n\npreconditions, the women instituted separate civil actions against\n\nthe United States, as a surrogate for the United States Postal\n\nService, under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1346(b), 2671-2680.       We chronicle the travel of these actions.\n\n            On May 2, 2007, Fothergill filed a complaint alleging\n\nthat the United States was liable in tort for her damages.              The\n\ngovernment responded by moving to dismiss the action for want of\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction.        Astonishingly, Fothergill did not\n\noppose the motion.\n\n            Well after the expiration of the deadline for filing an\n\nopposition to the government's motion, the district court (Pieras,\n\nJ.) granted the unopposed motion on the ground that the FTCA's\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fdiscretionary      function      exception     foreclosed    the     claim.     See\n\nFothergill v. United States, No. 07-cv-01378, slip op. at 5 (D.P.R.\n\nDec. 19, 2007) (unpublished).           Fothergill moved unsuccessfully for\n\nreconsideration and later appealed.\n\n            The same attorney represented the other plaintiff, del\n\nToro.     It is, therefore, unsurprising that her action traveled a\n\nsimilar path.      She sued on April 11, 2007; her complaint alleged\n\nthat the United States was liable in tort for her damages under the\n\nFTCA; and on September 22, 2007, the government moved to dismiss\n\nthe   complaint    for    want    of   subject-matter      jurisdiction.        The\n\nplaintiff did not deign to file an opposition to the government's\n\nmotion.\n\n            On    May    6,   2008,    the   district     court    (Casellas,   J.)\n\ndismissed    the   action,       holding     that   the   FTCA's    discretionary\n\nfunction exception barred its further prosecution.                   See Del Toro\n\nPineiro v. United States, No. 07-cv-01304, slip op. at 4 (D.P.R.\n\nMay 6, 2008) (unpublished).             In a binary move, del Toro sought\n\nreconsideration and served a notice of appeal.               After the district\n\ncourt declined to revisit its dismissal of the action, del Toro\n\namended her notice of appeal.\n\n            Fothergill's and del Toro's appeals present the same\n\ncentral issue.      Thus, we consolidated them.\n\n            The courts below acted in response to motions to dismiss\n\nfor lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.                  See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f12(b)(1).      When such decisions are made on the pleadings, they\n\nengender de novo review. See, e.g., McCloskey v. Mueller, 446 F.3d\n\n262, 266 (1st Cir. 2006); see also Irving v. United States, 162\n\nF.3d 154, 162 (1st Cir. 1998) (en banc) (explaining that de novo\n\nreview   is     appropriate   for   a     conclusion   that    the   FTCA's\n\ndiscretionary function exception applies). In carrying out that\n\ntask, we take as true all well-pleaded facts in the plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaints, scrutinize them in the light most hospitable to the\n\nplaintiffs' theory of liability, and draw all reasonable inferences\n\ntherefrom in the plaintiffs' favor.1          See Muñiz-Rivera v. United\n\nStates, 326 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 2003).        If the well-pleaded facts,\n\nevaluated in that generous manner, do not support a finding of\n\nfederal subject-matter jurisdiction, the orders of dismissal must\n\nstand.   See id.\n\n              Here, however, the usual, plaintiff-friendly standard of\n\nreview   is    tilted.   After   all,    neither   plaintiff   opposed   the\n\ngovernment's motion to dismiss.         Consequently, the plaintiffs have\n\nforfeited the argument in favor of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Leahy, 473 F.3d 401, 409-10 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n     1\n      This standard applies to motions to dismiss for want of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction that are adjudicated on the pleadings,\nin advance of jurisdictional discovery and without the taking of\nany evidence. Given the procedural posture of these appeals, we\nneed not dwell upon the standards that pertain in other\ncircumstances. See, e.g., Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock & Wilcox\nCan., 46 F.3d 138, 147-48 (1st Cir. 1995) (describing various\nstandards).\n\n                                    -5-\n\f2007).   Our review, accordingly, is only for plain error.            See,\n\ne.g., Dávila v. Corporación De P.R. Para La Difusion Publica, 498\n\nF.3d 9, 14-15 (1st Cir. 2007); Cipes v. Mikasa, Inc., 439 F.3d 52,\n\n56 (1st Cir. 2006).     Review for plain error places a formidable\n\nobstacle in an appellant's path.         A simple showing of error no\n\nlonger will suffice.    Rather, the appellant must make a four-part\n\nshowing: \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious\n\nand which not only (3) affected the [appellant's] substantial\n\nrights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.\"            United States v.\n\nDuarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).      We discern no error here,\n\nplain or otherwise.\n\n            The FTCA dominates the topography of this case.2           That\n\nstatute comprises a limited waiver of the federal government's\n\nsovereign   immunity   with   respect   to   private   causes   of   action\n\nsounding in tort.   Shansky v. United States, 164 F.3d 688, 690 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).     The plaintiffs sued on the basis of this limited\n\nwaiver, but the government asserts that the plaintiffs' claims fall\n\noutside the waiver's boundaries.        If that assertion holds water,\n\nthe FTCA affords no license for suing the federal government (and,\n\n\n     2\n       Although the Postal Reorganization Act itself contains a\ngeneralized waiver of immunity to suit, see 39 U.S.C. § 401(1),\nthat statute explicitly acknowledges that the provisions of the\nFTCA shall apply to all tort claims arising out of the Postal\nService's activities. See id. § 409(c); see also Dolan v. U.S.\nPostal Serv., 546 U.S. 481, 484 (2006); Davric Me. Corp. v. U.S.\nPostal Serv., 238 F.3d 58, 62 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                  -6-\n\fthus, no footing for the instant actions).                  See Hydrogen Tech.\n\nCorp. v. United States, 831 F.2d 1155, 1160 (1st Cir. 1987).               These\n\nappeals   hinge,   then,   on    the   credibility     of    the    government's\n\nassertion.\n\n            Congress has specified various situations in which the\n\nFTCA's circumscribed waiver of sovereign immunity will not attach.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 2680.         One such specification, pertinent here,\n\nrelates to claims \"based upon the exercise or performance or the\n\nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on\n\nthe part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government . .\n\n. .\"   Id. § 2680(a).      The courts below held that this provision\n\ncontrolled here. The analytic framework used in connection with the\n\ndiscretionary function inquiry is familiar: a court first must\n\nidentify the conduct that is alleged to have caused the harm, then\n\ndetermine    whether   that     conduct      can   fairly    be    described   as\n\ndiscretionary, and if so, decide whether the exercise or non-\n\nexercise of the granted discretion is actually or potentially\n\ninfluenced by policy considerations.           See Bolduc v. United States,\n\n402 F.3d 50, 60 (1st Cir. 2005); Shansky, 164 F.3d at 691-92.\n\n            This brings us to the claims at hand.                 To begin, each\n\nplaintiff alleges that the Postal Service (and, thus, the United\n\nStates) was guilty of negligence in designing and maintaining the\n\npremises of the Boqueron post office without \"the most elemental\n\nmeans to protect the areas inside its facility used by the public\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fto transact their business . . . from intrusion and injury\" by\n\nvehicles using the immediately adjacent parking areas.               In their\n\nappellate briefs, the plaintiffs flesh out this allegation.                They\n\nsay, in essence, that the Postal Service negligently designed the\n\nparking lot and the entrance to the post office, and that the\n\nplaintiffs' injuries could have been avoided if the Postal Service\n\nhad placed some sort of curb or barrier in front of the building's\n\nentrance or had marked the parking spaces differently.\n\n            It is possible to characterize these plaints either as\n\nclaims for improper design or as claims for negligent failure to\n\nfurnish a safe place within which postal patrons could transact\n\ntheir wonted business.       For present purposes, choosing between\n\nthese labels would be a pointless exercise; the applicability of\n\nthe discretionary function exception turns on the nature and\n\nquality of the harm-producing conduct, not on the plaintiffs'\n\ncharacterization of that conduct.            See Berkovitz v. United States,\n\n486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988).        Here, regardless of how the conduct is\n\ndenominated, the focus of the plaintiffs' complaints is on the\n\nPostal Service's decisionmaking with respect to the implementation\n\n(or eschewal) of safety measures in connection with its operation\n\nof the post office.\n\n            Having identified the harm-producing conduct, we proceed\n\nto   the   second   facet   of   the    inquiry.      In   carving   out   the\n\ndiscretionary function exception, Congress wanted to prevent courts\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\ffrom second-guessing legislative and administrative decisionmaking.\n\nSee id. at 536-37; United States v. S.A. Empresa de Viacao Aerea\n\nRio Grandense (Varig Airlines), 467 U.S. 797, 814 (1984).               Thus,\n\nthe next step is to determine whether the identified conduct\n\ninvolves a matter that the political branches have left to the\n\nactor's choice.\n\n           At its core, the identified conduct involves decisions\n\nabout what safety measures should be included and what should be\n\nexcluded in the layout of the post office and its appurtenant\n\namenities.     On the record before us, those decisions were wholly\n\ndiscretionary.    The plaintiffs have identified no law, regulation,\n\nrule, or other requirement that tied the Postal Service's hands in\n\nconfiguring and outfitting either the building or its adjacent\n\nparking areas.     In the absence of any such circumscription, the\n\npertinent decisions are matters of executive choice (that is,\n\nmatters committed to the discretion of the responsible officials).\n\nSee, e.g., Shansky, 164 F.3d at 691-92; Irving, 162 F.3d at 162-63.\n\n           The last phase of the inquiry requires us to determine\n\nwhether this discretion is of the type and kind that Congress\n\nsought to safeguard through the discretionary function exception.\n\nSee   United   States   v.   Gaubert,    499   U.S.   315,   322-23   (1991);\n\nBerkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536-37.          That question is easily answered\n\nhere.   Deciding whether to install curbs or barriers in a parking\n\nlot, when to do so, how to array them, and the like are variables\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fabout which reasonable persons can differ.             In the last analysis,\n\nthose choices are informed by a need to balance concerns about a\n\nmyriad of factors such as efficiency, safety, aesthetics, and cost.\n\nIn other words, those choices are readily susceptible to policy\n\nanalysis.\n\n            No more is exigible.          So long as there is room for\n\ndiffering policy judgments, there is discretion of the type and\n\nkind shielded by section 2680(a).           See Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 537;\n\nShansky, 164 F.3d at 692-93.\n\n            There remain two loose ends.          We address each of them\n\nbriefly.\n\n            First, the plaintiffs argue that there is no indication\n\nthat the Postal Service ever undertook to weigh the competing\n\npolicy   concerns     that   we   have   identified.         That   argument   is\n\nunavailing.\n\n            The law imposes no requirement that the government, as a\n\nprerequisite to invoking the discretionary function exception,\n\ndemonstrate   that    a   policy   judgment     actually      was   made.      The\n\ndiscretionary function exception applies to all acts and omissions\n\nthat are susceptible to policy analysis, whether or not that\n\nanalysis has been performed on a given occasion.              See Gaubert, 499\n\nU.S. at 324-25; Irving, 162 F.3d at 162.\n\n            Second,    the   plaintiffs      condemn   the    negligence    that\n\ninfuses the Postal Service's conduct.              But even if the Postal\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fService acted negligently — a matter on which we take no view —\n\nthat shortcoming would not profit the plaintiffs.\n\n             We already have established that the challenged conduct\n\nis of the nature and quality that Congress intended to protect by\n\nmeans   of    the   discretionary    function   exception.      Once   that\n\nprecondition has been satisfied, the prophylaxis of the exception\n\nattaches regardless of whether the decisionmaker acted negligently\n\nor manifestly abused the granted discretion.         See Ayer v. United\n\nStates, 902 F.2d 1038, 1041 (1st Cir. 1990); see also 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2680(a) (deeming immaterial the question of \"whether or not the\n\ndiscretion involved [was] abused\").\n\n             We need go no further.    In this instance, the plaintiffs\n\nhave neither alleged the existence of, nor otherwise identified,\n\nany mandatory law, rule, regulation, or policy that required the\n\nPostal Service to install curbs or barriers in front of the\n\nBoqueron post office, to lay out the parking lot in any special\n\nway, or otherwise to design or maintain the premises in a manner\n\nthat might have averted this unfortunate accident.           For aught that\n\nappears, the design criteria were in relevant part matters of\n\nunfettered executive choice.        Since the choices relative to design\n\nwere susceptible to policy analysis, the courts below did not err\n\nin applying the discretionary function exception and dismissing the\n\nplaintiffs' suits.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -12-\n\f",

In carrying out that task, we take as true all well-pleaded facts in the plaintiffs' complaints, scrutinize them in the light most hospitable to the plaintiffs' theory of liability, and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiffs' favor.<sup>[1]</sup><i>See </i><i>Muñiz-Rivera v. United States,</i> 326 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir.2003). If the well-pleaded facts, evaluated in that generous manner, do not support a finding of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, the orders of dismissal must stand. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>Here, however, the usual, plaintiff-friendly standard of review is tilted. After all, neither plaintiff opposed the government's motion to dismiss. Consequently, the plaintiffs have forfeited the argument in favor of subject-matter jurisdiction. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Leahy,</i> 473 F.3d 401, 409-10 (1st Cir.2007). Our review, accordingly, is only for plain error. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Dávila v. Corporación de P.R. Para La Difusion Publica,</i> 498 F.3d 9, 14-15 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Cipes v. Mikasa, Inc.,</i> 439 F.3d 52, 56 (1st Cir.2006). Review <span class=\"star-pagination\">*252</span> for plain error places a formidable obstacle in an appellant's path. A simple showing of error no longer will suffice. Rather, the appellant must make a four-part showing: \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the [appellant's] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001). We discern no error here, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p>The FTCA dominates the topography of this case.<sup>[2]</sup> That statute comprises a limited waiver of the federal government's sovereign immunity with respect to private causes of action sounding in tort. <i>Shansky v. United States,</i> 164 F.3d 688, 690 (1st Cir.1999). The plaintiffs sued on the basis of this limited waiver, but the government asserts that the plaintiffs' claims fall outside the waiver's boundaries. If that assertion holds water, the FTCA affords no license for suing the federal government (and, thus, no footing for the instant actions). <i>See </i><i>Hydrogen Tech. Corp. v. United States,</i> 831 F.2d 1155, 1160 (1st Cir.1987). These appeals hinge, then, on the credibility of the government's assertion.</p>\n<p>Congress has specified various situations in which the FTCA's circumscribed waiver of sovereign immunity will not attach. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2680. One such specification, pertinent here, relates to claims \"based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government....\" <i>Id.</i> § 2680(a). The courts below held that this provision controlled here. The analytic framework used in connection with the discretionary function inquiry is familiar: a court first must identify the conduct that is alleged to have caused the harm, then determine whether that conduct can fairly be described as discretionary, and if so, decide whether the exercise or non-exercise of the granted discretion is actually or potentially influenced by policy considerations. <i>See </i><i>Bolduc v. United States,</i> 402 F.3d 50, 60 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Shansky,</i> 164 F.3d at 691-92.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the claims at hand. To begin, each plaintiff alleges that the Postal Service (and, thus, the United States) was guilty of negligence in designing and maintaining the premises of the Boqueron post office without \"the most elemental means to protect the areas inside its facility used by the public to transact their business ... from intrusion and injury\" by vehicles using the immediately adjacent parking areas. In their appellate briefs, the plaintiffs flesh out this allegation. They say, in essence, that the Postal Service negligently designed the parking lot and the entrance to the post office, and that the plaintiffs' injuries could have been avoided if the Postal Service had placed some sort of curb or barrier in front of the building's entrance or had marked the parking spaces differently.</p>\n<p>It is possible to characterize these plaints either as claims for improper design or as claims for negligent failure to furnish a safe place within which postal patrons could transact their wonted business. For present purposes, choosing between these labels would be a pointless <span class=\"star-pagination\">*253</span> exercise; the applicability of the discretionary function exception turns on the nature and quality of the harm-producing conduct, not on the plaintiffs' characterization of that conduct. <i>See </i><i>Berkovitz v. United States,</i> 486 U.S. 531, 536, 108 S.Ct. 1954, 100 L.Ed.2d 531 (1988). Here, regardless of how the conduct is denominated, the focus of the plaintiffs' complaints is on the Postal Service's decisionmaking with respect to the implementation (or eschewal) of safety measures in connection with its operation of the post office.</p>\n<p>Having identified the harm-producing conduct, we proceed to the second facet of the inquiry. In carving out the discretionary function exception, Congress wanted to prevent courts from second-guessing legislative and administrative decisionmaking. <i>See id.</i> at 536-37; <i>United States v. S.A. Empresa de Viacao Aerea Rio Grandense (Varig Airlines),</i> 467 U.S. 797, 814, 104 S.Ct. 2755, 81 L.Ed.2d 660 (1984). Thus, the next step is to determine whether the identified conduct involves a matter that the political branches have left to the actor's choice.</p>\n<p>At its core, the identified conduct involves decisions about what safety measures should be included and what should be excluded in the layout of the post office and its appurtenant amenities. On the record before us, those decisions were wholly discretionary. The plaintiffs have identified no law, regulation, rule, or other requirement that tied the Postal Service's hands in configuring and outfitting either the building or its adjacent parking areas. In the absence of any such circumscription, the pertinent decisions are matters of executive choice (that is, matters committed to the discretion of the responsible officials). <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Shansky,</i> 164 F.3d at 691-92; <i>Irving,</i> 162 F.3d at 162-63.</p>\n<p>The last phase of the inquiry requires us to determine whether this discretion is of the type and kind that Congress sought to safeguard through the discretionary function exception. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gaubert,</i> 499 U.S. 315, 322-23, 111 S.Ct. 1267, 113 L.Ed.2d 335 (1991); <i>Berkovitz,</i> 486 U.S. at 536-37, 108 S.Ct. 1954. That question is easily answered here. Deciding whether to install curbs or barriers in a parking lot, when to do so, how to array them, and the like are variables about which reasonable persons can differ. In the last analysis, those choices are informed by a need to balance concerns about a myriad of factors such as efficiency, safety, aesthetics, and cost. In other words, those choices are readily susceptible to policy analysis.</p>\n<p>No more is exigible. So long as there is room for differing policy judgments, there is discretion of the type and kind shielded by section 2680(a). <i>See </i><i>Berkovitz,</i> 486 U.S. at 537, 108 S.Ct. 1954; <i>Shansky,</i> 164 F.3d at 692-93.</p>\n<p>There remain two loose ends. We address each of them briefly.</p>\n<p>First, the plaintiffs argue that there is no indication that the Postal Service ever undertook to weigh the competing policy concerns that we have identified. That argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p>The law imposes no requirement that the government, as a prerequisite to invoking the discretionary function exception, demonstrate that a policy judgment actually was made. The discretionary function exception applies to all acts and omissions that are susceptible to policy analysis, whether or not that analysis has been performed on a given occasion. <i>See </i><i>Gaubert,</i> 499 U.S. at 324-25, 111 S.Ct. 1267; <i>Irving,</i> 162 F.3d at 162.</p>\n<p>Second, the plaintiffs condemn the negligence that infuses the Postal Service's conduct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*254</span> But even if the Postal Service acted negligentlya matter on which we take no viewthat shortcoming would not profit the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>We already have established that the challenged conduct is of the nature and quality that Congress intended to protect by means of the discretionary function exception. Once that precondition has been satisfied, the prophylaxis of the exception attaches regardless of whether the decisionmaker acted negligently or manifestly abused the granted discretion. <i>See </i><i>Ayer v. United States,</i> 902 F.2d 1038, 1041 (1st Cir.1990); <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a) (deeming immaterial the question of \"whether or not the discretion involved [was] abused\").</p>\n<p>We need go no further. In this instance, the plaintiffs have neither alleged the existence of, nor otherwise identified, any mandatory law, rule, regulation, or policy that required the Postal Service to install curbs or barriers in front of the Boqueron post office, to lay out the parking lot in any special way, or otherwise to design or maintain the premises in a manner that might have averted this unfortunate accident. For aught that appears, the design criteria were in relevant part matters of unfettered executive choice. Since the choices relative to design were susceptible to policy analysis, the courts below did not err in applying the discretionary function exception and dismissing the plaintiffs' suits.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  This standard applies to motions to dismiss for want of subject-matter jurisdiction that are adjudicated on the pleadings, in advance of jurisdictional discovery and without the taking of any evidence. Given the procedural posture of these appeals, we need not dwell upon the standards that pertain in other circumstances. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Foster-Miller, Inc. v.

On that date, two unrelated parties (plaintiffs Lucy Fothergill and Cruz Teresa del Toro Pineiro) happened to be inside the facility. Each woman was bent on transacting routine business.</p>\n<p>In the same time frame, another postal customer was maneuvering her car in the parking lot. That customer accidentally drove her vehicle through the front entrance of the building and into its public area. Both plaintiffs sustained injuries as a result of the mishap.</p>\n<p>After complying with applicable administrative preconditions, the women instituted separate civil actions against the United States, as a surrogate for the United States Postal Service, under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2671-2680. We chronicle the travel of these actions.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*251</span> On May 2, 2007, Fothergill filed a complaint alleging that the United States was liable in tort for her damages. The government responded by moving to dismiss the action for want of subject-matter jurisdiction. Astonishingly, Fothergill did not oppose the motion.</p>\n<p>Well after the expiration of the deadline for filing an opposition to the government's motion, the district court (Pieras, J.) granted the unopposed motion on the ground that the FTCA's discretionary function exception foreclosed the claim. <i>See Fothergill v. United States,</i> No. 07-cv-01378, slip op. at 5 (D.P.R. Dec. 19, 2007) (unpublished). Fothergill moved unsuccessfully for reconsideration and later appealed.</p>\n<p>The same attorney represented the other plaintiff, del Toro. It is, therefore, unsurprising that her action traveled a similar path. She sued on April 11, 2007; her complaint alleged that the United States was liable in tort for her damages under the FTCA; and on September 22, 2007, the government moved to dismiss the complaint for want of subject-matter jurisdiction. The plaintiff did not deign to file an opposition to the government's motion.</p>\n<p>On May 6, 2008, the district court (Casellas, J.) dismissed the action, holding that the FTCA's discretionary function exception barred its further prosecution. <i>See Del Toro Pineiro v. United States,</i> No. 07-cv-01304, slip op. at 4 (D.P.R. May 6, 2008) (unpublished). In a binary move, del Toro sought reconsideration and served a notice of appeal. After the district court declined to revisit its dismissal of the action, del Toro amended her notice of appeal.</p>\n<p>Fothergill's and del Toro's appeals present the same central issue. Thus, we consolidated them.</p>\n<p>The courts below acted in response to motions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1).

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span>; <i>Irving,</i> 162 F.3d at 162.</p>\n<p>Second, the plaintiffs condemn the negligence that infuses the Postal Service's conduct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*254</span> But even if the Postal Service acted negligentlya matter on which we take no viewthat shortcoming would not profit the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>We already have established that the challenged conduct is of the nature and quality that Congress intended to protect by means of the discretionary function exception. Once that precondition has been satisfied, the prophylaxis of the exception attaches regardless of whether the decisionmaker acted negligently or manifestly abused the granted discretion. <i>See </i><i>Ayer v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541066\"><a href=\"/opinion/541066/donald-w-ayer-jr-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1038</span></a></span>, 1041 (1st Cir.1990); <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a) (deeming immaterial the question of \"whether or not the discretion involved [was] abused\").</p>\n<p>We need go no further. In this instance, the plaintiffs have neither alleged the existence of, nor otherwise identified, any mandatory law, rule, regulation, or policy that required the Postal Service to install curbs or barriers in front of the Boqueron post office, to lay out the parking lot in any special way, or otherwise to design or maintain the premises in a manner that might have averted this unfortunate accident. For aught that appears, the design criteria were in relevant part matters of unfettered executive choice. Since the choices relative to design were susceptible to policy analysis, the courts below did not err in applying the discretionary function exception and dismissing the plaintiffs' suits.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  This standard applies to motions to dismiss for want of subject-matter jurisdiction that are adjudicated on the pleadings, in advance of jurisdictional discovery and without the taking of any evidence. Given the procedural posture of these appeals, we need not dwell upon the standards that pertain in other circumstances. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Can.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195899\"><a href=\"/opinion/195899/foster-miller-inc-v-babcock/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 147-48 (1st Cir.1995) (describing various standards).</p>\n<p>[2]  Although the Postal Reorganization Act itself contains a generalized waiver of immunity to suit, <i>see</i> 39 U.S.C. § 401(1), that statute explicitly acknowledges that the provisions of the FTCA shall apply to all tort claims arising out of the Postal Service's activities. <i>See id.</i> § 409(c); <i>see also </i><i>Dolan v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145678\"><a href=\"/opinion/145678/dolan-v-postal-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span>, 484, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145678\"><a href=\"/opinion/145678/dolan-v-postal-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
