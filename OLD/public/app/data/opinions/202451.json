Pro se appellant Lee Woofenden appeals from\n\na   district    court    judgment       dismissing      his   action   for    lack   of\n\njurisdiction.         We affirm and grant sanctions, albeit in a lower\n\namount than the government seeks.1              See Szopa v. United States, 453\n\nF.3d 455, 456-58 (7th Cir. 2006); Szopa v.

The government moved to dismiss\n\nthe petition, contending that the district court lacked subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction.         At a hearing, the district court informed\n\nWoofenden      that   his   arguments      opposing      dismissal     were    \"wholly\n\nwithout merit,\" and that he should pursue his petition in the Tax\n\nCourt.    The district court dismissed the petition, and Woofenden\n\nappealed.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      Although Woofenden filed his suit against an individual\ngovernment employee, his suit is effectively against the United\nStates, and Department of Justice attorneys have briefed the\nappeal, moving for sanctions.\n\n                                          -2-\n\f          On appeal, Woofenden frivolously asserts that the case\n\ninvolves \"employment taxes\" (a matter within the district court's\n\njurisdiction), that he is not subject to income taxation, and that\n\nthe Tax Court lacks the power to adjudicate this case.        We rejected\n\nthe same arguments as frivolous two years ago in Marino v. Brown,\n\n357 F.3d 143, 145-46 (1st Cir. 2004) (per curiam), imposing a\n\nsanction of $2,000.
