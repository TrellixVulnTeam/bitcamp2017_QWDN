Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                  Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Thomas M. Dickinson, with whom Pine & Cantor was on brief for\nappellant.\n\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Stephanie S.\nBrowne, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                         August 20, 2002\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.       On February 1, 1999, there was a\n\nfire at a restaurant owned by defendant-appellant Franklin Diaz.\n\nThereafter, Diaz was charged by a federal grand jury in a six-count\n\nindictment with malicious destruction by fire of property used in\n\ninterstate commerce (arson) in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 844(i) and\n\n2 (Count I); mail and wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341,\n\n1343 and 2 (Counts II-IV); and use of fire to commit a federal\n\nfelony in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 844(h)(1) and 2 (Counts V-VI).\n\nAfter a six-day trial, a jury convicted Diaz on the arson charge in\n\nCount I and acquitted him on the remaining counts.             The district\ncourt sentenced Diaz to five years of imprisonment.\n\n           Diaz      now   appeals   his   arson   conviction,    primarily\nchallenging    the    district   court's   admission    of   expert   opinion\ntestimony as to the cause of the fire.        That challenge requires us\n\nto consider whether        the defendant properly advised the court of\nthe nature of his objection under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm.,\n\nInc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), to expert testimony presented by the\n\nprosecution.      We conclude that he did not.         For that reason and\nothers, we affirm the conviction.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           We describe the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict. See United States v. Van Horn, 277 F.3d 48, 54 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).    Diaz was the owner and operator of Franklin's Prestigio\n\nRestaurant, located at 247 Reservoir Avenue in Providence, Rhode\n\nIsland.    The restaurant occupied part of a building at 241-247\n\nReservoir Avenue that consisted of several adjacent storefronts.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fDiaz leased one of these storefronts and the basement below it from\n\nthe Camparone family, whose estate owned the building.\n\n             The government introduced evidence at trial casting doubt\non the financial viability of Diaz's business.                  For instance, in\n\n1994 and 1995, the restaurant operated at a loss.                 As of December\n\n31, 1998, its balance sheet reflected assets of only $21,444. Diaz\nhad expressed interest in selling the business and had complained\n\nabout having few customers.\n\n             In the summer of 1998, the Camparone family began efforts\n\nto sell 241-247 Reservoir Avenue.            Because Diaz had been in the\n\nbuilding longer than the other tenants, the Camparones gave him the\n\nright of first refusal to buy the building.                 Diaz explored the\n\npossibility of buying the building.           He spoke with Jaime Aguayo, a\nSmall   Business     Administration        (\"SBA\")    representative,       about\n\narranging financing for the purchase.                 The SBA advises small\n\nbusinesses on how to obtain bank loans and (if certain conditions\nare   met)   guarantees    up    to   80   percent   of   the    ultimate   loan.\n\nAccording to Aguayo's trial testimony, Diaz expressed concern that,\n\nif the Camparones sold the building to another tenant, he would be\n\nevicted.     Despite these initial inquiries, however, Diaz never\n\nsubmitted a completed business plan or copies of his tax returns,\n\na necessary step in the SBA application process.\n\n             At some point in October or November of 1998, Diaz had\n\nstill not succeeded in obtaining financing and Rocco Camparone told\n\nhim   that   he   would   sell   the   building      to   someone   else.     The\n\nCamparones then entered into an agreement to sell the building to\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fone of the other tenants.       A closing was scheduled for February 7,\n\n1999.   The government introduced evidence that Diaz was aware of\n\nthe pending sale and was upset about it.         However, Diaz denied any\nsuch knowledge in his deposition testimony (which was admitted into\n\nevidence at trial).         Diaz did not testify at the trial.\n\n              In mid-November 1998, Diaz applied for business insurance\nthrough Joseph Mazzotta, an insurance agent who had secured other\n\ninsurance coverage for Diaz.         Prior to that time, Mazzotta was\n\nunable to persuade Diaz to purchase business insurance coverage.\n\nDiaz had always said that he could not afford it.             In December\n\n1998, Lloyd's of London issued an insurance policy that provided\n\n$100,000 of coverage for the contents of the restaurant and $21,000\n\nof coverage for business interruption. In late January 1999, about\na week and a half before the fire, Diaz phoned Mazzotta several\n\ntimes to confirm that the insurance policy was in effect and\n\nvisited Mazzotta's office to obtain a copy of the policy.\n              On Monday, February 1, 1999, just before midnight, a\n\npasserby reported to a nearby fire station that the restaurant was\n\non fire.       When the firemen arrived, they found the restaurant\n\nlocked with no sign of a break-in.            Forcing their way into the\n\nbuilding, they discovered that the fire was in the basement.           The\n\nfire    was    ultimately    suppressed,    though   not   before   causing\n\nsignificant damage to the basement.\n\n              According to Diaz's deposition testimony, the restaurant\n\nwas closed on the day of the fire.         Diaz testified that he had been\n\nin the restaurant that day and he had locked it and activated the\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fburglar alarm before departing.               Diaz and his wife were the only\n\nones who possessed keys to the restaurant and only they and their\n\ndaughter knew the access code for the alarm.\n            On   the    night      of   the    fire,    Joseph      Dorsey,    a   fire\n\ninvestigator     with   the     Providence      Fire    Department,      arrived      to\n\nexamine the scene and to investigate the cause of the fire.                        Based\non this initial investigation, Dorsey surmised that the fire might\n\nhave been caused by an electrical malfunction associated with the\n\nradio in the basement.\n\n            A few days later, on February 5, insurance investigator\n\nThomas Haynes surveyed the scene of the fire at the insurance\n\ncompany's request.        His investigation in the basement revealed\n\nunusual burn patterns inconsistent with normal fires as well as\nmaterial on the floor that smelled like paint thinner.                        Based on\n\nhis investigation, he concluded that the fire was deliberately set.\n\n            On February 10, 1999, both Dorsey and Haynes returned\ntogether to the scene to conduct a joint investigation.                         Dorsey\n\ntestified   that   what       he   observed     on     this   day    caused    him    to\n\nreevaluate his initial determination that the fire was accidentally\n\nset.   According to their testimony at trial, Dorsey and Haynes\n\nobserved on this day that the burn patterns were consistent with an\n\naccelerant being used in the fire.              As part of the investigation,\n\na rug sample from underneath a fallen ceiling tile was sent out for\n\nlab testing.       That sample was found to contain some type of\n\naccelerant, such as paint thinner or gasoline.                      Based upon these\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\ffindings,    Haynes   and   Dorsey   opined     that   the   fire   was    set\n\nintentionally.\n\n                                     II.\n\n            On March 9, 2001, one business day before trial began,\n\ndefense counsel filed a two-page \"Pretrial Memorandum.\"1                   That\n\nmemorandum contained the following sentence: \"The only anticipated\n\nlegal issue potential would be the qualification of the experts,\n\nso-called, under the standards of the Daubert trilogy: Daubert v.\n\nMerrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993); General Electric\nCompany, et al. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136 (1997), and Kumho Tire v.\nCarmichael, 526 U.S. 137 (1999).\"\n\n            At trial, the government called fire investigator Dorsey\nto the witness stand.       Dorsey described his qualifications as an\nexpert in determining the cause and origin of fires.                He also\n\ndiscussed some of the methods used in reaching such determinations.\nDorsey then proceeded to testify as to the February 1 investigation\nof   the    restaurant's    basement.      He    testified    that,       while\n\nfirefighters were still busy spraying water in the basement, he\nsurveyed the basement with another investigator who had arrived on\nthe scene earlier.    That investigator called Dorsey's attention to\n\na melted-down radio and to burn damage to a nearby bed and a wall\ncontaining the wiring going to the outlet into which the radio was\nplugged.    Based on that initial examination, he concluded that the\n\n\n\n     1\n       For some reason, the docket sheet does not reflect that\nfiling. However, the parties do not appear to dispute that such a\ndocument was filed.\n\n                                     -6-\n\ffire might have been caused by an electrical problem associated\n\nwith the radio in the basement.\n\n          Dorsey testified that, after his second examination,\nconducted jointly with Haynes on February 10, he discovered the\n\nevidence that prompted his reevaluation of this conclusion.         At\n\nthis point in the direct examination, the prosecutor asked Dorsey\nfor his present opinion concerning the cause of the fire.      Defense\n\ncounsel's objection on grounds of \"foundation\" was sustained,\n\napparently because Dorsey had not yet explained what he saw during\n\nthe second examination that changed his opinion. Dorsey then\n\nexplained that he detected the odor of something like paint thinner\n\nand he observed irregular burn patterns indicative of the use of an\n\naccelerant.    He also observed that the wall where the radio had\nbeen plugged in did not burn through to the other side, causing him\n\nto eliminate the radio or some other electrical component as a\n\npossible cause of the fire.\n          The government then asked Dorsey again for his present\n\nopinion on the cause of the fire, prompting defense counsel to\n\nobject on the following grounds:\n\n          Competency to render the opinion.      And I\n          didn't have a chance to cross-examine as to\n          the complete elements of the fire scene\n          investigation  before   I   have   had    the\n          opportunity.  He can answer at some later\n          point.\n\nThe court overruled the objection, stating: \"It goes to the weight\n\nand not admissibility and you can cross-examine on that.\"       Dorsey\n\nthen opined that the fire was \"deliberately set.\"            On cross-\n\nexamination,   defense   counsel   challenged   Dorsey's   credibility,\n\n                                   -7-\n\fquestioning him at length on his qualifications as a cause-and-\n\norigin expert,    the   standards   and   methods   he   employed    in   his\n\nanalysis, and the factual basis for his opinion on the cause of the\nfire.\n\n           Thomas Haynes, the investigator retained by the insurance\n\ncompany to examine the restaurant premises after the fire, also\ntestified as an expert at trial.      After describing his credentials\n\nas a cause-and-origin expert, he testified that, on February 5, his\n\ninvestigation in the basement lasted about four hours and revealed\n\nunusual burn patterns inconsistent with normal fires as well as\n\nmaterial on the floor that smelled like paint thinner.              Based on\n\nthese factors, he concluded that the fire was an \"incendiary fire\",\n\nmeaning that it was deliberately set.      According to his testimony,\nhe took a sample of the carpet in the basement during this visit\n\nand sent it out for testing; that carpet sample ultimately tested\n\npositive for the presence of a high-level concentration of mineral\nspirits.\n\n           As to the joint investigation with Dorsey on February 10,\n\nHaynes testified that he showed Dorsey the irregular burn patterns\n\nin the basement area. Haynes explained how he examined with Dorsey\n\nthe electrical components in the room, including the copper wiring\n\nand the condition of the radio itself.      Finding insufficient signs\n\nof electrical activity, Haynes ruled out the theory that the fire\n\nwas electrical.\n\n           Based upon the two examinations and his burn pattern\n\nanalysis, Haynes testified that he had reached a settled opinion as\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fto the cause and origin of the fire.                When the prosecutor asked\n\nwhat that opinion was, defense counsel made the following brief\n\nobjection:    \"Objection.      Da[u]bert.\"          The    court       overruled       the\nobjection, allowing Haynes to answer.              Haynes then testified that\n\nhe believed that the \"origin of the fire was within the office in\n\nthe basement area, and it was the result of a deliberate, human act\nof arson.\"\n\n             On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Haynes\n\nat length on his qualifications as an expert, his methodology and\n\nthe basis for his ultimate opinion.            On redirect, Haynes testified\n\nwithout objection that, based upon the burn patterns he observed,\n\nhis opinion on the cause and origin of the fire would have remained\n\nthe same even if no evidence of mineral spirits or other accelerant\nhad been found.\n\n             At the close of the government's case, Diaz moved for\n\njudgment of acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.                          His defense\ncounsel   stated     that:    \"I   submit    to    the    court    that    both    were\n\nqualified     by   the     Court   [and]     accepted,      in    terms     of    their\n\nqualifications,       by     the   Court      as    experts       on     origin        and\n\ncause . . . .\"      He then proceeded to his Rule 29 argument that the\n\ntestimony    of    Dorsey    and   Haynes    conflicted      in    places,       and    he\n\nattacked the experts' investigation into what caused the fire.\n\nBased on these deficiencies in the expert witness testimony, he\n\nargued that there was insufficient evidence that the fire was\n\ndeliberately set:\n\n             [T]here is [a discrepancy between the two\n             experts' testimony] and . . . in fact, Mr.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f           Dorsey's opinion specifically followed more\n           closely the scientific method, but even that\n           opinion significantly diverged from that which\n           is the appropriate way and the suggested way\n           and the followed way of the scientific method,\n           to such an alarming degree that, in fact, the\n           Court cannot allow the Jury to make a decision\n           on something in which the scientific method\n           was not used when it was able to have been\n           used . . . .\n\nHe did not mention Daubert at this time.\n\n           The court denied Diaz's motion for acquittal, observing\n\nthat counsel had \"challenged their qualifications, which he's\n\nentitled to do, and the court has found that they were both well\n\nqualified to express the opinion.\"          The court stated that because\n\nboth witnesses had testified that the fire was of incendiary\norigin, \"the Jury would be well within its rights to find beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the fire was of incendiary origin.\"                 The\n\ncourt then explained how the evidence was sufficient with respect\nto other elements of the government's case.\n\n           After recalling Haynes for limited testimony as a defense\n\nwitness,2 the defense rested.        During a chambers conference later\n\nthat day, defense counsel renewed his Rule 29 motion for judgment\n\nof   acquittal   \"for   the   same   reasons   that   [he   had]   previously\n\nstated.\"   He also stated without elaboration: \"In addition, I make\n\na motion under Rule 702 that the opinions of the two experts be\n\nexcluded   under   the    Daubert     analysis   as    I    have   previously\n\n      2\n          Defense counsel asked Haynes to identify several\nphotographs that he had taken in the course of his investigation of\nthe fire. These photographs were admitted into evidence in the\ndefendant's case.    On cross-examination, Haynes testified that\nthere was nothing in those photographs that was inconsistent with\nhis opinion as to the cause and origin of the fire.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fmentioned.\"        The   court     denied   Diaz's    motion    to    exclude   the\n\ntestimony of the two experts and reserved judgment on the Rule 29\n\nmotion.    On March 19, 2001, after the jury had rendered its guilty\nverdict on the arson charge, the court denied the motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal.\n\n             On March 29, 2001, ten days after the jury's verdict,\ndefense counsel filed a motion for a new trial.                 In that motion,\n\nDiaz argued for the first time that the expert testimony of Dorsey\n\nand Haynes should be stricken under Fed. R. Evid. 702 not because\n\nthey were unqualified to testify as experts but because the actual\n\ntestimony that they gave did not satisfy Rule 702's three numbered\n\ncriteria.3        Diaz   specifically       argued,   inter    alia,    that    the\n\ninvestigation was deficient under those Rule 702 criteria insofar\nas there was no comparative testing of rug samples and the experts\n\ndid not follow standard procedures and protocols in their cause-\n\nand-origin investigations.          The court denied Diaz's motion.\n\n                                       III.\n\n             Diaz makes three related (albeit procedurally distinct)\narguments on appeal.        First, he challenges the admission of expert\ntestimony    of    Dorsey    and    Haynes,    attacking      the    validity   and\n\nreliability of the methodology underlying their testimony. Second,\nhe challenges the court's denial of his Rule 29 motion for judgment\nof acquittal.      Third, he claims that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his Rule 33 motion for a new trial.\n\n\n\n     3\n         See infra Section III.A.\n\n                                       -11-\n\fA.   Admission of Expert Testimony\n\n           1.    Gatekeeping Under Daubert\n\n           Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence governs the\n\nadmissibility of expert testimony. As recently amended, it provides\n\nthat a proposed expert witness must be sufficiently qualified to\n\nassist the trier of fact, and that his or her expert testimony must\n\nbe relevant to the task at hand and rest on a reliable basis:\n\n           If scientific, technical, or other specialized\n           knowledge will assist the trier of fact to\n           understand the evidence or to determine a fact\n           in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by\n           knowledge, skill, experience, training, or\n           education, may testify thereto in the form of\n           an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony\n           is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2)\n           the testimony is the product of reliable\n           principles and methods, and (3) the witness\n           has applied the principles and methods\n           reliably to the facts of the case.\nFed.

Puerto Rico Sun\n\n                                      -12-\n\fscreening    function    entails      a    preliminary      evaluation     of   the\n\nproffered expert testimony for both reliability and relevance. See\n\nDaubert, 509 U.S. at 591-595; Ruiz-Troche v. Pepsi Cola of Puerto\n\nRico   Bottling   Co.,   161   F.3d       77,   80   (1st   Cir.   1998)   (citing\n\nDaubert).    The review for reliability encompasses an assessment of\n\n\"whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is\nscientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology\n\nproperly can be applied to the facts in issue.\"               Daubert, 509 U.S.\n\nat 592-93.    As to the relevancy criterion, \"expert testimony must\n\nbe relevant not only in the sense that all evidence must be\n\nrelevant, but also in the incremental sense that the expert's\n\nproposed opinion, if admitted, likely would assist the trier of\n\nfact to understand or determine a fact in issue.\" Ruiz-Troche, 161\nF.3d at 81 (citation omitted) (citing Daubert, 509 U.S. at 591-92).\n\n            The Rule 702 inquiry is a \"flexible one,\" Daubert, 509\n\nU.S. at 594, and there is no particular procedure that the trial\ncourt is required to follow in executing its gatekeeping function\n\nunder Daubert.    In Kumho Tire, the Supreme Court stated:\n\n            The trial court must have the same kind of\n            latitude in deciding how to test an expert's\n            reliability, and to decide whether or when\n            special briefing or other proceedings are\n            needed to investigate reliability, as it\n            enjoys when it decides whether that expert's\n            relevant testimony is reliable. . . .\n            Otherwise, the trial judge would lack the\n            discretionary authority needed both to avoid\n            unnecessary   \"reliability\"  proceedings  in\n\n\nOil Co., Nos. 01-1791, 01-1792, 2002 WL 1431766 at *10 (1st Cir.\nJul. 9, 2002) (noting that a trial court's gatekeeping function\n\"applies to technical and other specialized knowledge in addition\nto scientific testimony\").\n\n                                      -13-\n\f          ordinary cases where the reliability of an\n          expert's methods is properly taken for\n          granted,    and    to   require    appropriate\n          proceedings in the less usual or more complex\n          cases where cause for questioning the expert's\n          reliability arises.\n\n526 U.S. at 152.   As the Ninth Circuit has determined, \"[a]lthough\nthe [Daubert] Court stated that the inquiry is a 'preliminary' one,\n\nto be made 'at the outset,' this does not mean that it must be made\n\nin a separate, pretrial hearing, outside the presence of the jury.\"\n\nUnited States v. Alatorre, 222 F.3d 1098, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000)\n\n(quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592) (finding voir dire of expert in\n\npresence of jury to be permissible under Daubert); see also United\n\nStates v. Nichols, 169 F.3d 1255, 1262-1264 (10th Cir. 1999) (trial\ncourt has discretion not to hold pretrial evidentiary reliability\n\nhearing in carrying out its gatekeeping function).\n\n          2.       Availability of Appellate Review for Diaz's\n                   Challenge to the Admission of Expert Testimony\n\n          Diaz argues that the district court improperly admitted\n\nexpert testimony by Dorsey and Haynes on the contested issue of\n\ncausation of the fire.    Specifically, he claims that this expert\ntestimony did not satisfy the three numbered criteria in Rule 702.\n\nThe government, however, maintains that Diaz failed to properly\n\npreserve this claim below, thus losing his right to raise that\nissue on appeal.\n\n          As a general rule, we review a trial court's decision to\nadmit or exclude expert testimony under an abuse of discretion\n\nstandard. See General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 138-39\n\n(1997).   However, Rule 103(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence\n\n                                -14-\n\fprovides that a claim of error may not be predicated on the\n\nadmission of evidence unless a timely objection is made -- stating\n\nthe \"specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not\napparent from the context\" -- and the admitted evidence affects a\n\nsubstantial right of the party.         Fed. R. Evid. 103(a).     As we have\n\npreviously stated, litigants must raise a timely objection to the\nvalidity or reliability of expert testimony under Daubert in order\n\nto preserve a challenge on appeal to the admissibility of that\n\nevidence.    See United States v. Gilbert, 181 F.3d 152, 162-63 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) (declining to consider Daubert validity challenge to\n\nadmitted expert testimony where no objection was made to the trial\ncourt on that basis); Cortes-Irizarry v. Corporacion Insular de\n\nSeguros, 111 F.3d 184, 189 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"[W]e can envision few,\n\nif   any,   cases   in   which   an   appellate   court   would   venture   to\nsuperimpose a Daubert ruling on a cold, poorly developed record\n\nwhen neither the parties nor the nisi prius court has had a\n\nmeaningful opportunity to mull the question.\").              However, these\nstatements about the appellate consequences of failing to make a\ntimely objection to the admission of expert testimony are qualified\nby Fed. R. Evid. 103(d): \"Nothing in this rule precludes taking\n\nnotice of plain errors affecting substantial rights although they\n\nwere not brought to the attention of the court.\"            The consequence\n\nof a party's failure to make a timely objection to the admission of\n\nexpert testimony is plain error review, not the complete loss of\n\n\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fany right to review.5   See Macsenti v. Becker, 237 F.3d 1223, 1230-\n\n31 (10th Cir. 2001) (reviewing admission of expert testimony for\n\nplain error where objection as to reliability under Daubert not\ntimely made); McKnight v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 36 F.3d 1396,\n\n1407 (8th Cir. 1994) (employing plain error review where objection\n\nasserting lack of foundation \"fail[ed] to raise any question about\nthe   scientific   validity   of    the   principles   and    methodology\n\nunderlying [witness'] testimony\").\n\n          3.   Diaz's Objection at Trial to the Expert Testimony\n\n          At trial, Diaz never raised a specific objection to the\n\nreliability of the experts' methodology under Daubert or Rule 702\n\nas a basis for exclusion.     In the two-page \"Pretrial Memorandum\"\n\nfiled on the eve of trial, defense counsel made a general reference\nto the Daubert trilogy in giving notice of a possible challenge to\n\nthe experts' qualifications: \"The only anticipated legal issue\n\npotential[ly] would be the qualification of the experts, so-called,\nunder the standards of the Daubert Trilogy . . . .\"          By its terms,\n\n\n      5\n       To support its position that Diaz's failure to make a timely\nobjection precludes any appellate review whatsoever, the government\ncites Diefenbach v. Sheridan Transportation, 229 F.3d 27 (1st Cir.\n2000), and United States v. Bruck, 152 F.3d 40 (1st Cir. 1998).\nThose cases are clearly distinguishable.       In Diefenbach, the\ndefendant explicitly waived in its appellate reply brief any\npossible objection to the validity of expert testimony under\nDaubert, stating that it \"has not raised the 'scientific\nvalidity[]' objection.\"    229 F.3d at 30.    Having found such an\nexplicit waiver, we did not have to address any potential Daubert\nchallenge to the validity of the expert testimony. Id. In Bruck,\nwe refused to entertain a challenge to the admission of expert\ntestimony where the point was perfunctorily raised and the\ndefendant was not clear in his appellate brief \"as to exactly what\ntestimony [he found] objectionable.\" 152 F.3d at 47. That is not\nthis case.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fthat statement anticipates that any attack on the expert testimony\n\nwould be limited to the witness's qualifications.\n\n            During the direct examination of Dorsey, defense counsel\nraised an objection, stating: \"Competency to render the opinion.\n\nAnd I didn't have a chance to cross-examine as to the complete\n\nelements of the fire scene investigation before I have had the\nopportunity.     He can answer at some later point.\"            In objecting to\n\nHaynes's    testimony,     counsel     raised       a    one-word     objection:\n\n\"Objection.       Da[u]bert.\"        The    court       overruled    both   these\n\nobjections.\n\n            Lumping these pre-trial and trial objections together,\n\nDiaz argues that he adequately apprised the court that he was\n\nseeking an opportunity to make an inquiry outside the presence of\nthe jury challenging not only the experts' qualifications, but also\n\nthe validity and reliability of the methodology underlying the\n\nexperts' testimony.      We disagree.      Daubert assigns to the district\n\ncourt the function of evaluating the proffered expert testimony\n\npursuant to the requirements of Rule 702. See 509 U.S. at 589-95.\n\nRule 702 encompasses an array of expert witness issues, including\n\nthe qualifications of the witness, the relevance of the proffered\n\ntestimony, the adequacy of the facts or data underlying an opinion,\n\nthe scientific reliability of the witness's methodology, and the\n\nreliability of the witness's application of that methodology to the\n\nfacts.    Fed. R. Evid. 702.     Diaz's general references at trial to\n\nDaubert    or   competency,   particularly      in      light   of   a   pretrial\n\nchallenge   limited   to   the   qualifications         of   the    experts,   was\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fwoefully deficient for the purpose of advising the district court\n\nthat Diaz was raising a challenge to the reliability of the\n\nexperts' methods and the application of those methods under Rule\n702.\n\n             To the contrary, the court reasonably understood that\n\nDiaz's Rule 702 objections were addressed only to the experts'\nqualifications.6     Indeed, in denying Diaz's Rule 29 motion for\n\nacquittal, the court observed that counsel had \"challenged their\n\nqualifications, which he's entitled to do, and the court has found\n\nthat they were both well qualified to express the opinion.\" During\n\narguments on the Rule 29 motion, defense counsel                    expressed a\n\nsimilar understanding of his Rule 702 objections: \"I submit to the\n\ncourt that both were qualified by the Court [and] accepted, in\nterms of their qualifications, by the Court as experts on origin\n\nand cause . . . .\"    In renewing his Rule 29 motion at the March 16,\n\n2001, chambers conference, Diaz's counsel stated that his renewed\nmotion was \"for the same reasons that [he had] previously stated.\"\n\nHe then stated, without elaboration: \"In addition, I make a motion\n\nunder Rule 702 that the opinions of the two experts be excluded\n\nunder the Daubert analysis as I have previously mentioned.\"                 This\n\ngeneric reference to \"the Daubert analysis\" could reasonably be\n\nunderstood    to   relate     back   to    his    attack    on   the    experts'\n\nqualifications.      Thus,    Diaz's      objections   at   trial      failed   to\n\nadequately preserve his substantive challenge to the reliability of\n\n\n       6\n        Diaz   does     not     challenge        on   appeal     the    experts'\nqualifications.\n\n                                     -18-\n\fthe expert witness testimony, leaving him only with plain error\n\nreview on that claim.\n\n           4.    Plain Error Analysis\n\n           To establish plain error in the admission of the experts'\n\ntestimony, Diaz must demonstrate \"(1) that an error occurred (2)\n\nwhich was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the\ndefendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n\nUnited States v. Lemmerer, 277 F.3d 579, 591 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). As noted, the criteria of Rule\n\n702   require    that    (1)   an    expert's    testimony      is   \"based   upon\n\nsufficient facts or data\"; (2) the testimony is the \"product of\n\nreliable principles and methods\"; and (3) the expert apply \"the\nprinciples and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\"                Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 702.      Here, both Dorsey and Haynes examined first-hand the\n\nbasement where the fire took place.              These examinations yielded\nnumerous details supporting their theories and refuting alternate\n\nexplanations for the cause of the fire.                  Moreover, Dorsey and\n\nHaynes explained in detail the methods and principles they employed\n\nin determining the cause and origin of fires, emphasizing the\n\nsignificance of various burn patterns.              They articulated their\n\nbases for eliminating alternative explanations for the fire.                     We\n\nnote that other courts have allowed the use of similar cause-and-\n\norigin testimony.       See, e.g., Travelers Prop. & Casualty Corp. v.\n\nGeneral   Electric      Co.,   150   F.Supp.2d    360,    366    (D.Conn.     2001)\n\n(challenged expert testimony found to be \"product of reliable\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fprinciples and methods\" where cause-and-origin opinion based upon\n\nanalysis of burn patterns); Abu-Hashish v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., 88\n\nF.Supp.2d 906 (N.D.Ill. 2000). Cf. United States v. Ruiz, 105 F.3d\n1492, 1497 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting significance of burn-pattern\n\ntestimony in ruling on sufficiency of evidence to support arson\n\nconviction).\n            Diaz claims that Dorsey and Haynes should have collected\n\nadditional samples of the basement carpet for testing and arranged\n\nfor testing of the electrical outlet.       Haynes, however, explained\n\nthat he eliminated the possibility of an electrical fire based\n\nupon, inter alia, (1) the condition of the radio and (2) the\n\nabsence of melted copper wiring (often associated with electrical\n\nactivity) in the electrical components in the room.          Diaz also\ncomplains of the experts' failure to investigate the contents of a\n\nmetal pot apparently found at the scene after suppression of the\n\nfire.\n            We note that Diaz explored these points and others in his\n\ncross-examination of the experts.         See Daubert, 509 U.S. at 596\n\n(\"Vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence,\n\nand careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional\n\nand     appropriate   means   of   attacking   shaky   but   admissible\n\nevidence.\"); Fed. R. Evid. 702 Advisory Committee Note to 2000\n\nAmendments (\"[T]he trial court's role as gatekeeper is not intended\n\nto serve as a replacement for the adversary system.\") (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).      Whatever deficiencies there may have\n\nbeen in the work of Dorsey and Haynes (and we do not imply that\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fthere were any), we are confident that there was no plain error in\n\nthe admission of their testimony.7\n\nB.   Rule 29 Motion for Judgment of Acquittal\n\n             At the close of the government's case, defense counsel\n\nmoved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.\n\nThe district court denied that motion, and denied it again upon its\n\nrenewal at the close of all the evidence.           Diaz now appeals that\n\nruling.\n\n             We typically review challenges to the denial of a Rule 29\n\nmotion    for   judgment   of   acquittal   under   a   de   novo   standard.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Ayala-Ayala, 289 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n2002). In assessing the sufficiency of the evidence under Rule 29,\n\"we view the evidence and draw reasonable inferences in the light\nmost favorable to the verdict.\"         United States v. McGauley, 279\n\nF.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir.      2002); United States v. Benjamin, 252 F.3d\n\n1, 5 (1st Cir. 2001). The evidence is legally sufficient if, taken\n\nas a whole, it warrants a judgment of conviction.             Benjamin, 252\nF.3d at 5.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       In a footnote in his brief, Diaz appears to suggest that the\nexpert testimony also violated Fed. R. Evid. 704(b) which prohibits\nan expert witness from stating an opinion as to whether or not a\ndefendant possessed the requisite mental state relevant to a\ncharged offense or a defense thereto. Diaz cannot prevail on that\nargument. First, Diaz failed to raise any Rule 704(b) objection at\ntrial. Moreover, Haynes and Dorsey concluded that someone had set\nthe fire deliberately, not that Diaz had done so with malicious\nintent.   Neither expert was ever asked, nor did they offer an\nopinion, as to whether Diaz set the fire and whether he did so\nmaliciously.\n\n                                    -21-\n\f              Here, however, Diaz confines his \"Rule 29\" claim to the\n\nlimited argument that, if the trial judge had stricken the expert\n\ntestimony by Dorsey and Haynes on causation, the remaining evidence\nwould have been insufficient to support his conviction and the\n\ncourt would have been compelled to grant his Rule 29 motion.            That\n\nargument is not a Rule 29 sufficiency challenge.           Under Rule 29, we\nmust examine \"all the evidence submitted to the jury, regardless of\n\nwhether it was properly admitted.\"            United States v. Gonzalez-\n\nSanchez, 825 F.2d 572, 588 (1st Cir. 1987).               \"A trial court in\n\npassing on [a Rule 29] motion considers all of the evidence it has\n\nadmitted, and . . . it must be this same quantum of evidence which\n\nis considered by the reviewing court.\"           Lockhart v. Nelson, 488\n\nU.S. 33, 41-42 (1988).         Thus, although Diaz styles this ground of\nappeal   as    a   Rule   29   sufficiency   challenge,    his   argument   is\n\ntantamount to the claim that admitting the expert testimony of\n\nDorsey and Haynes was prejudicial error -- a claim which we have\nalready rejected. See supra Section III.A. Diaz's appellate brief\n\nis devoid of any allegation that all of the evidence admitted --\n\nincluding the challenged expert testimony -- is insufficient to\n\nsupport his conviction.          Thus, we need not engage in such an\n\ninquiry.8\n\n\n\n\n     8\n        Even if we were to evaluate the sufficiency argument that\nDiaz fails to make -- namely, that all of the evidence admitted at\ntrial (including the expert testimony) is insufficient to support\nhis conviction, we would reject that argument. The record\nunmistakably contains sufficient evidence to support Diaz's arson\nconviction.\n\n                                     -22-\n\fC.   Rule 33 Motion for New Trial\n\n             Diaz argues that the district court erred in denying his\n\nmotion for a new trial under Fed. R. Crim. P. 33.           We typically\n\nreview a district court's denial of a motion for a new trial under\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 33 for a \"manifest abuse of discretion.\"          United\n\nStates v. Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 258 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nHowever, under Rule 33, Diaz had to file a motion for a new trial\n\nwithin seven days of the verdict.          Fed. R. Crim. P. 33 (new trial\n\nmotion based on grounds other than newly discovered evidence must\n\nbe   filed    within     seven   days   of   verdict).    That   rule   is\njurisdictional.    See United States v. Lema, 909 F.2d 561,      565 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).    Here, Diaz, having filed his new trial motion on March\n29, 2001, ten days after the jury's verdict, submitted his motion\none day late.     See Fed. R. Crim. P. 45(a) (excluding intermediate\n\nSaturdays and Sundays from computation).         Thus, the district court\nhad no authority to order a new trial pursuant to Rule 33.              See\n\nUnited States v. Fontanez, 628 F.2d 687, 691 (1st Cir. 1980) (\"The\n\ndistrict court was clearly correct in finding that the seven-day\nfiling rule [under Rule 33] is jurisdictional and that it had no\nauthority to entertain the motion for a new trial, which was one\n\nday late.\").\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\f",

That challenge requires us to consider whether the defendant properly advised the court of the nature of his objection under <i>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc.,</i> 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), to expert testimony presented by the prosecution. We conclude that he did not. For that reason and others, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We describe the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>See United States v. Van Horn,</i> 277 F.3d 48, 54 (1st Cir.2002). Diaz was the owner and operator of Franklin's Prestigio Restaurant, located at 247 Reservoir Avenue in Providence, Rhode Island. The restaurant occupied part of a building at 241-247 Reservoir Avenue that consisted of several adjacent storefronts. Diaz leased one of these storefronts and the basement below it from the Camparone family, whose estate owned the building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government introduced evidence at trial casting doubt on the financial viability of Diaz's business. For instance, in 1994 and 1995, the restaurant operated at a loss. As of December 31, 1998, its balance sheet reflected assets of only $21,444. Diaz had expressed interest in selling the business and had complained about having few customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1998, the Camparone family began efforts to sell 241-247 Reservoir Avenue. Because Diaz had been in the building longer than the other tenants, the Camparones gave him the right of first refusal to buy the building. Diaz explored the possibility of buying the building. He spoke with Jaime Aguayo, a Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") representative, about arranging financing for the purchase. The SBA advises small businesses on how to obtain bank loans and (if certain conditions are met) guarantees up to 80 percent of the ultimate loan. According to Aguayo's trial testimony, Diaz expressed concern that, if the Camparones sold the building to another tenant, he would be evicted. Despite these initial inquiries, however, Diaz never submitted a completed business plan or copies of his tax returns, a necessary step in the SBA application process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point in October or November of 1998, Diaz had still not succeeded in obtaining financing and Rocco Camparone told him that he would sell the building to someone else. The Camparones then entered into an agreement to sell the building to one of the other tenants. A closing was scheduled for February 7, 1999. The government introduced evidence that Diaz was aware of the pending sale and was upset about it. However, Diaz denied any such knowledge in his deposition testimony (which was admitted into evidence at trial). Diaz did not testify at the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-November 1998, Diaz applied for business insurance through Joseph Mazzotta, an insurance agent who had secured other insurance coverage for Diaz. Prior to that time, Mazzotta was unable to persuade Diaz to purchase business insurance coverage. Diaz had always said that he could not afford it. In December 1998, Lloyd's of London issued an insurance policy that provided $100,000 of coverage for the contents of the restaurant and $21,000 of coverage for business interruption. In late January 1999, about a week and a half before the fire, Diaz phoned Mazzotta several times to confirm that the insurance policy was in effect and visited Mazzotta's office to obtain a copy of the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Monday, February 1, 1999, just before midnight, a passerby reported to a nearby fire station that the restaurant was on fire. When the firemen arrived, they found the restaurant locked with no sign of a break-in. Forcing their way into the building, they discovered that the fire was in the basement. The fire was ultimately suppressed, though not before causing significant damage to the basement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Diaz's deposition testimony, the restaurant was closed on the day of the fire. Diaz testified that he had been in the restaurant that day and he had locked it and activated the burglar alarm before departing. Diaz and his wife were the only ones who possessed keys to the restaurant and only they and their daughter knew the access code for the alarm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the night of the fire, Joseph Dorsey, a fire investigator with the Providence Fire Department, arrived to examine the scene and to investigate the cause of the fire. Based on this initial investigation, Dorsey surmised that the fire might have been caused by an electrical malfunction associated with the radio in the basement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days later, on February 5, insurance investigator Thomas Haynes surveyed the scene of the fire at the insurance company's request. His investigation in the basement revealed unusual burn patterns inconsistent with normal fires as well as material on the floor that smelled like paint thinner. Based on his investigation, he concluded that the fire was deliberately set.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 10, 1999, both Dorsey and Haynes returned together to the scene to conduct a joint investigation. Dorsey testified that what he observed on this day caused him to reevaluate his initial determination that the fire was accidentally set. According to their testimony at trial, Dorsey and Haynes observed on this day that the burn patterns were consistent with an accelerant being used in the fire. As part of the investigation, a rug sample from underneath a fallen ceiling tile was sent out for lab testing. That sample was found to contain some type of accelerant, such as paint thinner or gasoline. Based upon these findings, Haynes and Dorsey opined that the fire was set intentionally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 9, 2001, one business day before trial began, defense counsel filed a two-page \"Pretrial Memorandum.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> That memorandum contained the following sentence: \"The only anticipated legal issue potential would be the qualification of the experts, so-called, under the standards of the <i>Daubert</i> trilogy: <i>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc.,</i> 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993); <i>General Electric Company, et al. v. Joiner,</i> 522 U.S. 136, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997), and <i>Kumho Tire v. Carmichael,</i> 526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999).\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government called fire investigator Dorsey to the witness stand. Dorsey described his qualifications as an expert in determining the cause and origin of fires. He also discussed some of the methods used in reaching such determinations. Dorsey then proceeded to testify as to the February 1 investigation of the restaurant's basement. He testified that, while firefighters were still busy spraying water in the basement, he surveyed the basement with another investigator who had arrived on the scene earlier. That investigator called Dorsey's attention to a melted-down radio and to burn damage to a nearby bed and a wall containing the wiring going to the outlet into which the radio was plugged. Based on that initial examination, he concluded that the fire might have been caused by an electrical problem associated with the radio in the basement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dorsey testified that, after his second examination, conducted jointly with Haynes on February 10, he discovered the evidence that prompted his reevaluation of this conclusion. At this point in the direct examination, the prosecutor asked Dorsey for his present opinion concerning the cause of the fire. Defense counsel's objection on grounds of \"foundation\" was sustained, apparently because Dorsey had not yet explained what he saw during the second examination that changed his opinion. Dorsey then explained that he detected the odor of something like paint thinner and he observed irregular burn patterns indicative of the use of an accelerant. He also observed that the wall where the radio had been plugged in did not burn through to the other side, causing him to eliminate the radio or some other electrical component as a possible cause of the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then asked Dorsey again for his present opinion on the cause of the fire, prompting defense counsel to object on the following grounds:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Competency to render the opinion. And I didn't have a chance to cross-examine as to the complete elements of the fire scene investigation before I have had the opportunity. He can answer at some later point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court overruled the objection, stating: \"It goes to the weight and not admissibility and you can cross-examine on that.\" Dorsey then opined that the fire was \"deliberately set.\" On cross-examination, defense counsel challenged Dorsey's credibility, questioning him at length on his qualifications as a cause-and-origin expert, the standards and methods he employed in his analysis, and the factual basis for his opinion on the cause of the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thomas Haynes, the investigator retained by the insurance company to examine the restaurant premises after the fire, also testified as an expert at trial. After describing his credentials as a cause-and-origin expert, he testified that, on February 5, his investigation in the basement lasted about four hours and revealed unusual burn patterns inconsistent with normal fires as well as material on the floor that smelled like paint thinner. Based on these factors, he concluded that the fire was an \"incendiary fire\", meaning that it was deliberately set. According to his testimony, he took a sample of the carpet in the basement during this visit and sent it out for testing; that carpet sample ultimately tested positive for the presence of a high-level concentration of mineral spirits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the joint investigation with Dorsey on February 10, Haynes testified that he showed Dorsey the irregular burn patterns in the basement area. Haynes explained how he examined with Dorsey the electrical components in the room, including the copper wiring and the condition of the radio itself. Finding insufficient signs of electrical activity, Haynes ruled out the theory that the fire was electrical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based upon the two examinations and his burn pattern analysis, Haynes testified that he had reached a settled opinion as to the cause and origin of the fire. When the prosecutor asked what that opinion was, defense counsel made the following brief objection: \"Objection. Da[u]bert.\" The court overruled the objection, allowing Haynes to answer. Haynes then testified that he believed that the \"origin of the fire was within the office in the basement area, and it was the result of a deliberate, human act of arson.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Haynes at length on his qualifications as an expert, his methodology and the basis for his ultimate opinion. On redirect, Haynes testified without objection that, based upon the burn patterns he observed, his opinion on the cause and origin of the fire would have remained the same even if no evidence of mineral spirits or other accelerant had been found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the government's case, Diaz moved for judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. His defense counsel stated that: \"I submit to the court that both were qualified by the Court [and] accepted, in terms of their qualifications, by the Court as experts on origin and cause....\" He then proceeded to his Rule 29 argument that the testimony of Dorsey and Haynes conflicted in places, and he attacked the experts' investigation into what caused the fire. Based on these deficiencies in the expert witness testimony, he argued that there was insufficient evidence that the fire was deliberately set:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]here is [a discrepancy between the two experts' testimony] and ... in fact, Mr. Dorsey's opinion specifically followed more closely the scientific method, but even that opinion significantly diverged from that which is the appropriate way and the suggested way and the followed way of the scientific method, to such an alarming degree that, in fact, the Court cannot allow the Jury to make a decision on something in which the scientific method was not used when it was able to have been used....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He did not mention <i>Daubert</i> at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court denied Diaz's motion for acquittal, observing that counsel had \"challenged their qualifications, which he's entitled to do, and the court has found that they were both well qualified to express the opinion.\" The court stated that because both witnesses had testified that the fire was of incendiary origin, \"the Jury would be well within its rights to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the fire was of incendiary origin.\" The court then explained how the evidence was sufficient with respect to other elements of the government's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After recalling Haynes for limited testimony as a defense witness,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the defense rested. During a chambers conference later that day, defense counsel renewed his Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal \"for the same reasons that [he had] previously stated.\" He also stated without elaboration: \"In addition, I make a motion under Rule 702 that the opinions of the two experts be excluded under the <i>Daubert</i> analysis as I have previously mentioned.\" The court denied Diaz's motion to exclude the testimony of the two experts and reserved judgment on the Rule 29 motion. On March 19, 2001, after the jury had rendered its guilty verdict on the arson charge, the court denied the motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 29, 2001, ten days after the jury's verdict, defense counsel filed a motion for a new trial. In that motion, Diaz argued for the first time that the expert testimony of Dorsey and Haynes should be stricken under Fed.R.Evid. 702 not because they were unqualified to testify as experts but because the actual testimony that they gave did not satisfy Rule 702's three numbered criteria.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Diaz specifically argued, <i>inter alia,</i> that the investigation was deficient under those Rule 702 criteria insofar as there was no comparative testing of rug samples and the experts did not follow standard procedures and protocols in their cause-and-origin investigations. The court denied Diaz's motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diaz makes three related (albeit procedurally distinct) arguments on appeal. First, he challenges the admission of expert testimony of Dorsey and Haynes, attacking the validity and reliability of the methodology underlying their testimony. Second, he challenges the court's denial of his Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. Third, he claims that the district court erred in denying his Rule 33 motion for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Admission of Expert Testimony</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Gatekeeping Under Daubert</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence governs the admissibility of expert testimony. As recently amended, it provides that a proposed expert witness must be sufficiently qualified to assist the trier of fact, and that his or her expert testimony must be relevant to the task at hand and rest on a reliable basis:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Evid. 702. <i>See</i> 4 Jack B.

Specifically, he claims that this expert testimony did not satisfy the three numbered criteria in Rule 702. The government, however, maintains that Diaz failed to properly preserve this claim below, thus losing his right to raise that issue on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general rule, we review a trial court's decision to admit or exclude expert testimony under an abuse of discretion standard. <i>See General Electric Co. v.

In the two-page \"Pretrial Memorandum\" filed on the eve of trial, defense counsel made a general reference to the <i>Daubert</i> trilogy in giving notice of a possible challenge to the experts' qualifications: \"The only anticipated legal issue potential[ly] would be the qualification of the experts, so-called, under the standards of the <i>Daubert</i> Trilogy....\" By its terms, that statement anticipates that any attack on the expert testimony would be limited to the witness's qualifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the direct examination of Dorsey, defense counsel raised an objection, stating: \"Competency to render the opinion. And I didn't have a chance to cross-examine as to the complete elements of the fire scene investigation before I have had the opportunity. He can answer at some later point.\" In objecting to Haynes's testimony, counsel raised a one-word objection: \"Objection.

We disagree. <i>Daubert</i> assigns to the district court the function of evaluating the proffered expert testimony pursuant to the requirements of Rule 702. <i>See</i> 509 U.S. at 589-95. Rule 702 encompasses an array of expert witness issues, including the qualifications of the witness, the relevance of the proffered testimony, the adequacy of the facts or data underlying an opinion, the scientific reliability of the witness's methodology, and the reliability of the witness's application of that methodology to the facts. Fed.R.Evid. 702. Diaz's general references at trial to <i>Daubert</i> or competency, particularly in light of a pretrial challenge limited to the qualifications of the experts, was woefully deficient for the purpose of advising the district court that Diaz was raising a challenge to the reliability of the experts' methods and the application of those methods under Rule 702.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the contrary, the court reasonably understood that Diaz's Rule 702 objections were addressed only to the experts' <i>qualifications.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Indeed, in denying Diaz's Rule 29 motion for acquittal, the court observed that counsel had \"challenged their qualifications, which he's entitled to do, and the court has found that they were both well qualified to express the opinion.\" During arguments on the Rule 29 motion, defense counsel expressed a similar understanding of his Rule 702 objections: \"I submit to the court that both were qualified by the Court [and] accepted, in terms of their qualifications, by the Court as experts on origin and cause....\" In renewing his Rule 29 motion at the March 16, 2001, chambers conference, Diaz's counsel stated that his renewed motion was \"for the same reasons that [he had] previously stated.\" He then stated, without elaboration: \"In addition, I make a motion under Rule 702 that the opinions of the two experts be excluded under the <i>Daubert</i> analysis as I have previously mentioned.\" This generic reference to \"the <i>Daubert</i> analysis\" could reasonably be understood to relate back to his attack on the experts' qualifications. Thus, Diaz's objections at trial failed to adequately preserve his substantive challenge to the reliability of the expert witness testimony, leaving him only with plain error review on that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Plain Error Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish plain error in the admission of the experts' testimony, Diaz must demonstrate \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Lemmerer,</i> 277 F.3d 579, 591 (1st Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). As noted, the criteria of Rule 702 require that (1) an expert's testimony is \"based upon sufficient facts or data\"; (2) the testimony is the \"product of reliable principles and methods\"; and (3) the expert apply \"the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\" Fed. R.Evid. 702. Here, both Dorsey and Haynes examined first-hand the basement where the fire took place. These examinations yielded numerous details supporting their theories and refuting alternate explanations for the cause of the fire. Moreover, Dorsey and Haynes explained in detail the methods and principles they employed in determining the cause and origin of fires, emphasizing the significance of various burn patterns. They articulated their bases for eliminating alternative explanations for the fire. We note that other courts have allowed the use of similar cause-and-origin testimony. <i>See, e.g., Travelers Prop. &amp; Casualty Corp. v. General Electric Co.,</i> 150 F.Supp.2d 360, 366 (D.Conn.2001) (challenged expert testimony found to be \"product of reliable principles and methods\" where cause-and-origin opinion based upon analysis of burn patterns); <i>Abu-Hashish v. Scottsdale Ins. Co.,</i> 88 F.Supp.2d 906 (N.D.Ill.2000). <i>Cf. United States v. Ruiz,</i> 105 F.3d 1492, 1497 (1st Cir.1997) (noting significance of burn-pattern testimony in ruling on sufficiency of evidence to support arson conviction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diaz claims that Dorsey and Haynes should have collected additional samples of the basement carpet for testing and arranged for testing of the electrical outlet. Haynes, however, explained that he eliminated the possibility of an electrical fire based upon, <i>inter alia,</i> (1) the condition of the radio and (2) the absence of melted copper wiring (often associated with electrical activity) in the electrical components in the room. Diaz also complains of the experts' failure to investigate the contents of a metal pot apparently found at the scene after suppression of the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that Diaz explored these points and others in his cross-examination of the experts. <i>See Daubert,</i> 509 U.S. at 596 (\"Vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.\"); Fed. R.Evid. 702 Advisory Committee Note to 2000 Amendments (\"[T]he trial court's role as gatekeeper is not intended to serve as a replacement for the adversary system.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). Whatever deficiencies there may have been in the work of Dorsey and Haynes (and we do not imply that there were any), we are confident that there was no plain error in the admission of their testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Rule 29 Motion for Judgment of Acquittal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the government's case, defense counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. The district court denied that motion, and denied it again upon its renewal at the close of all the evidence. Diaz now appeals that ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We typically review challenges to the denial of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal under a <i>de novo</i> standard. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Ayala-Ayala,</i> 289 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.2002). In assessing the sufficiency of the evidence under Rule 29, \"we view the evidence and draw reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the verdict.\" <i>United States v. McGauley,</i> 279 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Benjamin,</i> 252 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2001). The evidence is legally sufficient if, taken as a whole, it warrants a judgment of conviction. <i>Benjamin,</i> 252 F.3d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, Diaz confines his \"Rule 29\" claim to the limited argument that, if the trial judge had stricken the expert testimony by Dorsey and Haynes on causation, the remaining evidence would have been insufficient to support his conviction and the court would have been compelled to grant his Rule 29 motion. That argument is not a Rule 29 sufficiency challenge. Under Rule 29, we must examine \"all the evidence submitted to the jury, regardless of whether it was properly admitted.\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Sanchez,</i> 825 F.2d 572, 588 (1st Cir. 1987). \"A trial court in passing on [a Rule 29] motion considers all of the evidence it has admitted, and ... it must be this same quantum of evidence which is considered by the reviewing court.\" <i>Lockhart v. Nelson,</i> 488 U.S. 33, 41-42, 109 S.Ct. 285, 102 L.Ed.2d 265 (1988). Thus, although Diaz styles this ground of appeal as a Rule 29 sufficiency challenge, his argument is tantamount to the claim that admitting the expert testimony of Dorsey and Haynes was prejudicial error &#8212; a claim which we have already rejected. <i>See supra</i> Section III.A. Diaz's appellate brief is devoid of any allegation that all of the evidence admitted &#8212; including the challenged expert testimony &#8212; is insufficient to support his conviction. Thus, we need not engage in such an inquiry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Rule 33 Motion for New Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diaz argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33. We typically review a district court's denial of a motion for a new trial under Fed. R.Crim.P. 33 for a \"manifest abuse of discretion.\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Gonzalez,</i> 258 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir.2001). However, under Rule 33, Diaz had to file a motion for a new trial within seven days of the verdict. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 (new trial motion based on grounds other than newly discovered evidence must be filed within seven days of verdict). That rule is jurisdictional. <i>See United States v. Lema,</i> 909 F.2d 561, 565 (1st Cir.1990). Here, Diaz, having filed his new trial motion on March 29, 2001, ten days after the jury's verdict, submitted his motion one day late. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 45(a) (excluding intermediate Saturdays and Sundays from computation). Thus, the district court had no authority to order a new trial pursuant to Rule 33. <i>See United States v. Fontanez,</i> 628 F.2d 687, 691 (1st Cir.1980) (\"The district court was clearly correct in finding that the seven-day filing rule [under Rule 33] is jurisdictional and that it had no authority to entertain the motion for a new trial, which was one day late.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For some reason, the docket sheet does not reflect that filing.

Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co.,</i> 295 F.3d 68, 81 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that a trial court's gatekeeping function \"applies to technical and other specialized knowledge in addition to scientific testimony\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> To support its position that Diaz's failure to make a timely objection precludes any appellate review whatsoever, the government cites<i>Diefenbach v.

In <i>Diefenbach,</i> the defendant explicitly waived in its appellate reply brief any possible objection to the validity of expert testimony under <i>Daubert,</i> stating that it \"has not raised the `scientific validity[]' objection.\" 229 F.3d at 30. Having found such an explicit waiver, we did not have to address any potential <i>Daubert</i> challenge to the validity of the expert testimony. <i>Id.</i> In <i>Bruck,</i> we refused to entertain a challenge to the admission of expert testimony where the point was perfunctorily raised and the defendant was not clear in his appellate brief \"as to exactly what testimony [he found] objectionable.\" 152 F.3d at 47. That is not this case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Diaz does not challenge on appeal the experts' qualifications</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In a footnote in his brief, Diaz appears to suggest that the expert testimony also violated Fed.R.Evid. 704(b) which prohibits an expert witness from stating an opinion as to whether or not a defendant possessed the requisite mental state relevant to a charged offense or a defense thereto. Diaz cannot prevail on that argument. First, Diaz failed to raise any Rule 704(b) objection at trial. Moreover, Haynes and Dorsey concluded that<i>someone</i> had set the fire deliberately, not that Diaz had done so with malicious intent. Neither expert was ever asked, nor did they offer an opinion, as to whether Diaz set the fire and whether he did so maliciously.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Even if we were to evaluate the sufficiency argument that Diaz fails to make &#8212; namely, that all of the evidence admitted at trial (including the expert testimony) is insufficient to support his conviction, we would reject that argument.

Thereafter, Diaz was charged by a federal grand jury in a six-count indictment with malicious destruction by fire of property used in interstate commerce (arson) in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 844(i) and 2 (Count I); mail and wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341, 1343 and 2 (Counts II-IV); and use of fire to commit a federal felony in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 844(h)(1) and 2 (Counts V-VI). After a six-day trial, a jury convicted Diaz on the arson charge in Count I and acquitted him on the remaining counts.

That challenge requires us to consider whether the defendant properly advised the court of the nature of his objection under <i>Daubert v.

Diaz was the owner and operator of Franklin's Prestigio Restaurant, located at 247 Reservoir Avenue in Providence, Rhode Island. The restaurant occupied part of a building at 241-247 Reservoir Avenue that consisted of several adjacent storefronts. Diaz leased one of these storefronts and the basement below it from the Camparone family, whose estate owned the building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government introduced evidence at trial casting doubt on the financial viability of Diaz's business. For instance, in 1994 and 1995, the restaurant operated at a loss. As of December 31, 1998, its balance sheet reflected assets of only $21,444. Diaz had expressed interest in selling the business and had complained about having few customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1998, the Camparone family began efforts to sell 241-247 Reservoir Avenue. Because Diaz had been in the building longer than the other tenants, the Camparones gave him the right of first refusal to buy the building. Diaz explored the possibility of buying the building. He spoke with Jaime Aguayo, a Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") representative, about arranging financing for the purchase. The SBA advises small businesses on how to obtain bank loans and (if certain conditions are met) guarantees up to 80 percent of the ultimate loan. According to Aguayo's trial testimony, Diaz expressed concern that, if the Camparones sold the building to another tenant, he would be evicted. Despite these initial inquiries, however, Diaz never submitted a completed business plan or copies of his tax returns, a necessary step in the SBA application process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point in October or November of 1998, Diaz had still not succeeded in obtaining financing and Rocco Camparone told him that he would sell the building to someone else. The Camparones then entered into an agreement to sell the building to one of the other tenants. A closing was scheduled for February 7, 1999. The government introduced evidence that Diaz was aware of the pending sale and was upset about it. However, Diaz denied any such knowledge in his deposition testimony (which was admitted into evidence at trial). Diaz did not testify at the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-November 1998, Diaz applied for business insurance through Joseph Mazzotta, an insurance agent who had secured other insurance coverage for Diaz. Prior to that time, Mazzotta was unable to persuade Diaz to purchase business insurance coverage. Diaz had always said that he could not afford it. In December 1998, Lloyd's of London issued an insurance policy that provided $100,000 of coverage for the contents of the restaurant and $21,000 of coverage for business interruption. In late January 1999, about a week and a half before the fire, Diaz phoned Mazzotta several times to confirm that the insurance policy was in effect and visited Mazzotta's office to obtain a copy of the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Monday, February 1, 1999, just before midnight, a passerby reported to a nearby fire station that the restaurant was on fire. When the firemen arrived, they found the restaurant locked with no sign of a break-in. Forcing their way into the building, they discovered that the fire was in the basement. The fire was ultimately suppressed, though not before causing significant damage to the basement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Diaz's deposition testimony, the restaurant was closed on the day of the fire. Diaz testified that he had been in the restaurant that day and he had locked it and activated the burglar alarm before departing. Diaz and his wife were the only ones who possessed keys to the restaurant and only they and their daughter knew the access code for the alarm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the night of the fire, Joseph Dorsey, a fire investigator with the Providence Fire Department, arrived to examine the scene and to investigate the cause of the fire. Based on this initial investigation, Dorsey surmised that the fire might have been caused by an electrical malfunction associated with the radio in the basement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days later, on February 5, insurance investigator Thomas Haynes surveyed the scene of the fire at the insurance company's request. His investigation in the basement revealed unusual burn patterns inconsistent with normal fires as well as material on the floor that smelled like paint thinner. Based on his investigation, he concluded that the fire was deliberately set.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 10, 1999, both Dorsey and Haynes returned together to the scene to conduct a joint investigation. Dorsey testified that what he observed on this day caused him to reevaluate his initial determination that the fire was accidentally set. According to their testimony at trial, Dorsey and Haynes observed on this day that the burn patterns were consistent with an accelerant being used in the fire. As part of the investigation, a rug sample from underneath a fallen ceiling tile was sent out for lab testing. That sample was found to contain some type of accelerant, such as paint thinner or gasoline. Based upon these findings, Haynes and Dorsey opined that the fire was set intentionally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 9, 2001, one business day before trial began, defense counsel filed a two-page \"Pretrial Memorandum.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> That memorandum contained the following sentence: \"The only anticipated legal issue potential would be the qualification of the experts, so-called, under the standards of the <i>Daubert</i> trilogy: <i>Daubert v.

Dorsey described his qualifications as an expert in determining the cause and origin of fires. He also discussed some of the methods used in reaching such determinations. Dorsey then proceeded to testify as to the February 1 investigation of the restaurant's basement. He testified that, while firefighters were still busy spraying water in the basement, he surveyed the basement with another investigator who had arrived on the scene earlier. That investigator called Dorsey's attention to a melted-down radio and to burn damage to a nearby bed and a wall containing the wiring going to the outlet into which the radio was plugged. Based on that initial examination, he concluded that the fire might have been caused by an electrical problem associated with the radio in the basement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dorsey testified that, after his second examination, conducted jointly with Haynes on February 10, he discovered the evidence that prompted his reevaluation of this conclusion. At this point in the direct examination, the prosecutor asked Dorsey for his present opinion concerning the cause of the fire. Defense counsel's objection on grounds of \"foundation\" was sustained, apparently because Dorsey had not yet explained what he saw during the second examination that changed his opinion. Dorsey then explained that he detected the odor of something like paint thinner and he observed irregular burn patterns indicative of the use of an accelerant. He also observed that the wall where the radio had been plugged in did not burn through to the other side, causing him to eliminate the radio or some other electrical component as a possible cause of the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then asked Dorsey again for his present opinion on the cause of the fire, prompting defense counsel to object on the following grounds:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Competency to render the opinion.

After describing his credentials as a cause-and-origin expert, he testified that, on February 5, his investigation in the basement lasted about four hours and revealed unusual burn patterns inconsistent with normal fires as well as material on the floor that smelled like paint thinner. Based on these factors, he concluded that the fire was an \"incendiary fire\", meaning that it was deliberately set. According to his testimony, he took a sample of the carpet in the basement during this visit and sent it out for testing; that carpet sample ultimately tested positive for the presence of a high-level concentration of mineral spirits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the joint investigation with Dorsey on February 10, Haynes testified that he showed Dorsey the irregular burn patterns in the basement area. Haynes explained how he examined with Dorsey the electrical components in the room, including the copper wiring and the condition of the radio itself. Finding insufficient signs of electrical activity, Haynes ruled out the theory that the fire was electrical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based upon the two examinations and his burn pattern analysis, Haynes testified that he had reached a settled opinion as to the cause and origin of the fire. When the prosecutor asked what that opinion was, defense counsel made the following brief objection: \"Objection. Da[u]bert.\" The court overruled the objection, allowing Haynes to answer. Haynes then testified that he believed that the \"origin of the fire was within the office in the basement area, and it was the result of a deliberate, human act of arson.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Haynes at length on his qualifications as an expert, his methodology and the basis for his ultimate opinion. On redirect, Haynes testified without objection that, based upon the burn patterns he observed, his opinion on the cause and origin of the fire would have remained the same even if no evidence of mineral spirits or other accelerant had been found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the government's case, Diaz moved for judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. His defense counsel stated that: \"I submit to the court that both were qualified by the Court [and] accepted, in terms of their qualifications, by the Court as experts on origin and cause....\" He then proceeded to his Rule 29 argument that the testimony of Dorsey and Haynes conflicted in places, and he attacked the experts' investigation into what caused the fire. Based on these deficiencies in the expert witness testimony, he argued that there was insufficient evidence that the fire was deliberately set:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]here is [a discrepancy between the two experts' testimony] and ... in fact, Mr. Dorsey's opinion specifically followed more closely the scientific method, but even that opinion significantly diverged from that which is the appropriate way and the suggested way and the followed way of the scientific method, to such an alarming degree that, in fact, the Court cannot allow the Jury to make a decision on something in which the scientific method was not used when it was able to have been used....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He did not mention <i>Daubert</i> at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court denied Diaz's motion for acquittal, observing that counsel had \"challenged their qualifications, which he's entitled to do, and the court has found that they were both well qualified to express the opinion.\" The court stated that because both witnesses had testified that the fire was of incendiary origin, \"the Jury would be well within its rights to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the fire was of incendiary origin.\" The court then explained how the evidence was sufficient with respect to other elements of the government's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After recalling Haynes for limited testimony as a defense witness,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the defense rested. During a chambers conference later that day, defense counsel renewed his Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal \"for the same reasons that [he had] previously stated.\" He also stated without elaboration: \"In addition, I make a motion under Rule 702 that the opinions of the two experts be excluded under the <i>Daubert</i> analysis as I have previously mentioned.\" The court denied Diaz's motion to exclude the testimony of the two experts and reserved judgment on the Rule 29 motion. On March 19, 2001, after the jury had rendered its guilty verdict on the arson charge, the court denied the motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 29, 2001, ten days after the jury's verdict, defense counsel filed a motion for a new trial. In that motion, Diaz argued for the first time that the expert testimony of Dorsey and Haynes should be stricken under Fed.R.Evid. 702 not because they were unqualified to testify as experts but because the actual testimony that they gave did not satisfy Rule 702's three numbered criteria.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Diaz specifically argued, <i>inter alia,</i> that the investigation was deficient under those Rule 702 criteria insofar as there was no comparative testing of rug samples and the experts did not follow standard procedures and protocols in their cause-and-origin investigations.

We disagree. <i>Daubert</i> assigns to the district court the function of evaluating the proffered expert testimony pursuant to the requirements of Rule 702. <i>See</i> 509 U.S. at 589-95. Rule 702 encompasses an array of expert witness issues, including the qualifications of the witness, the relevance of the proffered testimony, the adequacy of the facts or data underlying an opinion, the scientific reliability of the witness's methodology, and the reliability of the witness's application of that methodology to the facts. Fed.R.Evid. 702. Diaz's general references at trial to <i>Daubert</i> or competency, particularly in light of a pretrial challenge limited to the qualifications of the experts, was woefully deficient for the purpose of advising the district court that Diaz was raising a challenge to the reliability of the experts' methods and the application of those methods under Rule 702.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the contrary, the court reasonably understood that Diaz's Rule 702 objections were addressed only to the experts' <i>qualifications.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Indeed, in denying Diaz's Rule 29 motion for acquittal, the court observed that counsel had \"challenged their qualifications, which he's entitled to do, and the court has found that they were both well qualified to express the opinion.\" During arguments on the Rule 29 motion, defense counsel expressed a similar understanding of his Rule 702 objections: \"I submit to the court that both were qualified by the Court [and] accepted, in terms of their qualifications, by the Court as experts on origin and cause....\" In renewing his Rule 29 motion at the March 16, 2001, chambers conference, Diaz's counsel stated that his renewed motion was \"for the same reasons that [he had] previously stated.\" He then stated, without elaboration: \"In addition, I make a motion under Rule 702 that the opinions of the two experts be excluded under the <i>Daubert</i> analysis as I have previously mentioned.\" This generic reference to \"the <i>Daubert</i> analysis\" could reasonably be understood to relate back to his attack on the experts' qualifications. Thus, Diaz's objections at trial failed to adequately preserve his substantive challenge to the reliability of the expert witness testimony, leaving him only with plain error review on that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Plain Error Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish plain error in the admission of the experts' testimony, Diaz must demonstrate \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v.

Ruiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197202\"><a href=\"/opinion/197202/united-states-v-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1492</span></a></span>, 1497 (1st Cir.1997) (noting significance of burn-pattern testimony in ruling on sufficiency of evidence to support arson conviction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diaz claims that Dorsey and Haynes should have collected additional samples of the basement carpet for testing and arranged for testing of the electrical outlet. Haynes, however, explained that he eliminated the possibility of an electrical fire based upon, <i>inter alia,</i> (1) the condition of the radio and (2) the absence of melted copper wiring (often associated with electrical activity) in the electrical components in the room. Diaz also complains of the experts' failure to investigate the contents of a metal pot apparently found at the scene after suppression of the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that Diaz explored these points and others in his cross-examination of the experts. <i>See Daubert,</i> 509 U.S. at 596 (\"Vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.\"); Fed. R.Evid. 702 Advisory Committee Note to 2000 Amendments (\"[T]he trial court's role as gatekeeper is not intended to serve as a replacement for the adversary system.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). Whatever deficiencies there may have been in the work of Dorsey and Haynes (and we do not imply that there were any), we are confident that there was no plain error in the admission of their testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Rule 29 Motion for Judgment of Acquittal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the government's case, defense counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. The district court denied that motion, and denied it again upon its renewal at the close of all the evidence. Diaz now appeals that ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We typically review challenges to the denial of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal under a <i>de novo</i> standard. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Ayala-Ayala,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199930\"><a href=\"/opinion/199930/united-states-v-ayala-ayala/\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.2002). In assessing the sufficiency of the evidence under Rule 29, \"we view the evidence and draw reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the verdict.\" <i>United States v. McGauley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776395\"><a href=\"/opinion/776395/united-states-v-karen-m-mcgauley/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 66 (1st Cir.2002); <i>United States v.

The evidence is legally sufficient if, taken as a whole, it warrants a judgment of conviction. <i>Benjamin,</i> 252 F.3d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, Diaz confines his \"Rule 29\" claim to the limited argument that, if the trial judge had stricken the expert testimony by Dorsey and Haynes on causation, the remaining evidence would have been insufficient to support his conviction and the court would have been compelled to grant his Rule 29 motion. That argument is not a Rule 29 sufficiency challenge. Under Rule 29, we must examine \"all the evidence submitted to the jury, regardless of whether it was properly admitted.\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Sanchez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492352\"><a href=\"/opinion/492352/united-states-v-pedro-m-gonzalez-sanchez-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">825</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span>, 588 (1st Cir. 1987). \"A trial court in passing on [a Rule 29] motion considers all of the evidence it has admitted, and ... it must be this same quantum of evidence which is considered by the reviewing court.\" <i>Lockhart v. Nelson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112155\"><a href=\"/opinion/112155/lockhart-v-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 41-42, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112155\"><a href=\"/opinion/112155/lockhart-v-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span> (1988). Thus, although Diaz styles this ground of appeal as a Rule 29 sufficiency challenge, his argument is tantamount to the claim that admitting the expert testimony of Dorsey and Haynes was prejudicial error &#8212; a claim which we have already rejected. <i>See supra</i> Section III.A. Diaz's appellate brief is devoid of any allegation that all of the evidence admitted &#8212; including the challenged expert testimony &#8212; is insufficient to support his conviction. Thus, we need not engage in such an inquiry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Rule 33 Motion for New Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diaz argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33. We typically review a district court's denial of a motion for a new trial under Fed. R.Crim.P. 33 for a \"manifest abuse of discretion.\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Gonzalez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774127\"><a href=\"/opinion/774127/united-states-v-manuel-gonzalez-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2001). However, under Rule 33, Diaz had to file a motion for a new trial within seven days of the verdict. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 (new trial motion based on grounds other than newly discovered evidence must be filed within seven days of verdict). That rule is jurisdictional. <i>See United States v. Lema,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545476\"><a href=\"/opinion/545476/united-states-v-charles-donald-lema/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span>, 565 (1st Cir.1990). Here, Diaz, having filed his new trial motion on March 29, 2001, ten days after the jury's verdict, submitted his motion one day late. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 45(a) (excluding intermediate Saturdays and Sundays from computation). Thus, the district court had no authority to order a new trial pursuant to Rule 33. <i>See United States v. Fontanez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"381352\"><a href=\"/opinion/381352/united-states-v-alberto-cruz-fontanez/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span>, 691 (1st Cir.1980) (\"The district court was clearly correct in finding that the seven-day filing rule [under Rule 33] is jurisdictional and that it had no authority to entertain the motion for a new trial, which was one day late.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For some reason, the docket sheet does not reflect that filing.

Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200019\"><a href=\"/opinion/200019/supplies-inc-v-pr-sun-oil-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 81 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that a trial court's gatekeeping function \"applies to technical and other specialized knowledge in addition to scientific testimony\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> To support its position that Diaz's failure to make a timely objection precludes any appellate review whatsoever, the government cites<i>Diefenbach v. Sheridan Transportation,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199520\"><a href=\"/opinion/199520/diefenbach-v-sheridan-transport/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2000), and <i>United States v. Bruck,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198104\"><a href=\"/opinion/198104/united-states-v-bruck/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1998). Those cases are clearly distinguishable. In <i>Diefenbach,</i> the defendant explicitly waived in its appellate reply brief any possible objection to the validity of expert testimony under <i>Daubert,</i> stating that it \"has not raised the `scientific validity[]' objection.\" 229 F.3d at 30. Having found such an explicit waiver, we did not have to address any potential <i>Daubert</i> challenge to the validity of the expert testimony. <i>Id.</i> In <i>Bruck,</i> we refused to entertain a challenge to the admission of expert testimony where the point was perfunctorily raised and the defendant was not clear in his appellate brief \"as to exactly what testimony [he found] objectionable.\" 152 F.3d at 47. That is not this case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Diaz does not challenge on appeal the experts' qualifications</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In a footnote in his brief, Diaz appears to suggest that the expert testimony also violated Fed.R.Evid. 704(b) which prohibits an expert witness from stating an opinion as to whether or not a defendant possessed the requisite mental state relevant to a charged offense or a defense thereto. Diaz cannot prevail on that argument. First, Diaz failed to raise any Rule 704(b) objection at trial. Moreover, Haynes and Dorsey concluded that<i>someone</i> had set the fire deliberately, not that Diaz had done so with malicious intent. Neither expert was ever asked, nor did they offer an opinion, as to whether Diaz set the fire and whether he did so maliciously.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Even if we were to evaluate the sufficiency argument that Diaz fails to make &#8212; namely, that all of the evidence admitted at trial (including the expert testimony) is insufficient to support his conviction, we would reject that argument.
