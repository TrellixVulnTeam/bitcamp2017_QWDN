Plaintiffs-appellants, Keith\n\nStewart and Diana Ramírez (hereinafter jointly referred to as the\n\n\"plaintiffs\"),      brought    a    diversity     action      against     defendants-\n\nappellees, Tupperware Corporation, American Motorists Insurance\n\nCompany, Sunny Islands Sales Inc., Ruth Fuente Alicia (\"Fuente\")\n\nand her conjugal partner (hereinafter collectively referred to as\n\nthe \"defendants\").      The district court found that the plaintiffs'\n\ndamages    claims    failed        to   satisfy    the       amount-in-controversy\n\nrequirement of 28 U.S.C. § 1332 and therefore dismissed the case\n\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to defendants'\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) motion.            For the reasons stated below, we\n\nreverse.\n\n                                   I.   Background\n\n           Plaintiffs, recently married, traveled to Puerto Rico\n\nfor their honeymoon.          On September 12, 2000, plaintiffs went to\n\nCharlie Auto to rent a car.             Driving their rental car, plaintiffs\n\nexited Charlie Auto and proceeded eastbound on Magdalena Avenue.\n\n           Meanwhile,      defendant        Fuente      was    departing     from   an\n\nengagement arranged by co-defendant Tupperware Corporation. Fuente\n\ndrove   southbound    on   Condado       Avenue    --    a    one   way   street    for\n\nnorthbound traffic only.\n\n           When plaintiffs reached the intersection of Magdalena\n\nAvenue and Condado Avenue, they proceeded through the intersection\n\nbecause they had a green light.             Fuente, still driving the wrong\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fway down a one way street, drove her car into the left side of\n\nplaintiffs' car.         Both plaintiffs were injured in the crash and\n\nwere taken by ambulance to a nearby emergency clinic.\n\n             As   a     result    of    the    crash,       Diana    Ramírez    suffered\n\nwhiplash, chest trauma, cuts on her leg, and bruising on many parts\n\nof her body.      These injuries have allegedly resulted in continuing\n\nchest and neck pain which has inhibited Ramírez's life.                               For\n\nexample, she claims that the chest pain was too severe to allow her\n\nto breast feed her newborn child or have sexual relations with her\n\nhusband.     Further, Ramírez's injuries limited the amount of work\n\nshe could perform at her job.\n\n             A medical examination conducted a little less than two\n\nyears    after    the    crash    reported         that   Ramírez     suffers    from   a\n\npermanent       incapacity       of    3%     of    her     bodily    functions.        A\n\npsychological      examination         conducted      one    year    after     the   crash\n\nestimated       that    Ramírez       requires      intensive       psychotherapy      and\n\nmedication for one year.\n\n             Keith Stewart suffered whiplash as a result of the crash.\n\nA medical examination conducted a little less than two years after\n\nthe     crash     reported       that       Stewart       suffered     from     cervical\n\nparavertebral muscle strain and that the crash caused Stewart to\n\nhave    7%   permanent     impairment         of   his    total     bodily    functions.\n\nStewart alleges that the injuries hinder his ability to work as a\n\nNew York policeman and prevented him from having intimate contact\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fwith his wife for about two to three months.             A psychological\n\nexamination conducted a year after the crash reported that Stewart\n\nsuffered intense emotional trauma.        The psychologist recommended\n\nintensive psychotherapy and medication for approximately one year.\n\n                            II.    Analysis\n\n           We review the district court's dismissal for lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction de novo.          Spielman v. Genzyme Corp.,\n\n251 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2001).          According to 28 U.S.C. § 1332,\n\nfederal \"district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all\n\ncivil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or\n\nvalue of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs,\" and there is\n\ndiversity of citizenship.       28 U.S.C. § 1332(a).     Where there are\n\nmultiple plaintiffs, each must allege a claim that is in excess of\n\n$75,000.   See Clark v. Paul Gray Inc., 306 U.S. 583, 589 (1939).\n\nIn this case, there is no question that diversity of citizenship\n\nexists.    Rather, the dispute turns on whether the damages exceed\n\n$75,000.\n\n           Since   plaintiffs    seek    to   invoke   federal   diversity\n\njurisdiction, they have the burden of showing that their claims\n\nmeet the amount-in-controversy requirement.        Spielman, 251 F.3d at\n\n4.   The longstanding test for determining whether a party has met\n\nthe amount-in-controversy states that:\n\n           The rule governing dismissal for want of\n           jurisdiction in cases brought in the federal\n           court is that, unless the law gives a\n           different rule, the sum claimed by the\n\n                                   -4-\n\f           plaintiff controls if the claim is apparently\n           made in good faith. It must appear to a legal\n           certainty that the claim is really for less\n           than the jurisdictional amount to justify\n           dismissal.\n\nSt. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U.S. 283, 288-89\n\n(1938) (footnotes omitted).      When applying this test, a court must\n\nlook at the circumstances at the time the complaint is filed.\n\nSpielman, 251 F.3d at 5.           Plaintiffs' \"general allegation of\n\ndamages that meet the amount requirement suffices unless questioned\n\nby the opposing party or the court.\"               Id. (citing Dep't of\n\nRecreation & Sports v. World Boxing Ass'n, 924 F.2d 84, 88 (1st\n\nCir.   1991)).   If     the   opposing    party    questions   the   damages\n\nallegation, then \"'the party seeking to invoke jurisdiction has the\n\nburden of alleging with sufficient particularity facts indicating\n\nthat it is not a legal certainty that the claim involves less than\n\nthe jurisdictional amount.'\"       Id. (quoting Dep't of Recreation and\n\nSports, 924 F.2d at 88) (further citations omitted).           Further,\n\n           if, from the face of the pleadings, it is\n           apparent, to a legal certainty, that the\n           plaintiff cannot recover the amount claimed,\n           or if, from the proofs, the court is satisfied\n           to a like certainty that the plaintiff never\n           was entitled to recover that amount, . . . the\n           suit will be dismissed.\n\nSt. Paul, 303 U.S. at 289 (footnote omitted).\n\n           Plaintiffs    brought    their   suit    under   the   diversity\n\njurisdiction of the federal court alleging Puerto Rican law causes\n\nof action.   See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938).\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fPlaintiffs brought claims for (1) past and future physical, mental,\n\nand emotional anguish, pain and suffering; (2) mental and emotional\n\nanguish and distress resulting from witnessing their spouse suffer;\n\n(3) loss of enjoyment of life and loss of consortium; (4) permanent\n\nimpairment to total bodily functions; and (5) future medical costs.\n\n          Defendants questioned plaintiffs' allegation that the\n\ndamages for each plaintiff exceeded $75,000.            Thus, plaintiffs had\n\nthe burden of alleging facts indicating that it is not a legal\n\ncertainty that their individual claims involve less than $75,000.\n\nTo meet this burden, Diana Ramírez produced written interrogatories\n\ndocumenting her injuries and pain, a medical report concluding that\n\nRamírez suffered a 3% permanent impairment and was at risk of\n\ndeveloping cervical spondylosis as a result of the accident, and a\n\npsychological   evaluation      documenting     her    emotional   trauma   and\n\nrecommending      intensive       psychotherapy       and    medication     for\n\napproximately one year.\n\n          Keith       Stewart      produced     written       interrogatories\n\ndocumenting his injuries, pain, and difficulty performing his job\n\nas a New York policeman, a medical report concluding that Stewart\n\nsuffered a 7% permanent impairment, and a psychological evaluation\n\ndocumenting    his    emotional    trauma     and   recommending    intensive\n\npsychotherapy and medication for approximately one year.\n\n          The        district      court,      after        considering     the\n\ninterrogatories, medical reports, and psychological evaluations,\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fconcluded that the plaintiffs failed to submit facts indicating\n\nthat it was not a legal certainty that their individual claims\n\ninvolved less than $75,000.      We disagree.\n\n           In reaching its conclusions, the district court examined\n\npersonal injury cases from the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, most of\n\nwhich were over forty years old, which awarded damages, adjusted\n\nfor inflation, far below $75,000 for injuries similar to those\n\nsuffered by the plaintiffs.        Relying on the amount of damages\n\nawarded by Commonwealth courts constituted error. Contra Thomas v.\n\nTravelers Ins. Co., 258 F. Supp. 873 (E.D. La. 1966).           Although\n\n\"federal courts must, of course, look to state law to determine the\n\nnature and extent of the right to be enforced in a diversity case,\"\n\nthe \"determination of the value of the matter in controversy for\n\npurposes of federal jurisdiction is a federal question to be\n\ndecided under federal standards.\" Horton v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,\n\n367 U.S. 348, 352-53 (1961).       In our view, the district court's\n\ndecision constituted error.\n\n           Using Puerto Rico Supreme Court cases to analyze the\n\namount-in-controversy for diversity purposes is the equivalent of\n\ncomparing apples and oranges.      Damages in a Puerto Rico civil case\n\nare determined by a judge, not a jury.      In contrast, in the federal\n\ncourts,   \"[t]he   task   of   estimating   money   damages,   especially\n\nintangible, noneconomic loss, constitutes a core jury function.\"\n\nDavignon v. Clemmey, 322 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2003).       Thus, Puerto\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fRico Supreme Court cases are not an accurate indicator of the\n\npossible damages that a federal jury would award for a claim\n\nbrought under Puerto Rico law.\n\n          We have previously held that a federal district court, in\n\ndetermining whether a damage award is excessive, should not compare\n\ndamages awarded in a federal diversity case with damages awarded by\n\nthe Supreme Court of Puerto Rico.      See Grajales-Romero v. American\n\nAirlines, Inc., 194 F.3d 288, 300 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting Mejías-\n\nQuirós v. Maxxam Property Corp., 108 F.3d 425, 427 n.1 (1st Cir.\n\n1997)). The fact that judges in the commonwealth courts frequently\n\naward lesser sums than juries in the federal court \"does not\n\noverride the general rule that a federal jury . . . is not bound in\n\nmaking its determination by the amount that the Commonwealth courts\n\nhave awarded or approved.\"   Correa v. Hosp. San Francisco, 69 F.3d\n\n1184, 1198 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting LaForest v. Autoridad de las\n\nFuentes Fluviales, 536 F.2d 443, 446-47 (1st Cir. 1976)).          We\n\nlikewise hold that in determining the amount-in-controversy, a\n\nfederal district court should not be constrained by the amounts\n\nawarded by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico.\n\n          We believe, based on the evidence, that the plaintiffs\n\nmet their burden of alleging facts indicating that it is not a\n\nlegal certainty that their claims involve less than $75,000.     This\n\nbecomes clear after examining cases, affirmed by this court, in\n\nwhich federal juries in Puerto Rico returned verdicts for injuries\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fsimilar to plaintiffs'.    Taking notice of amounts recovered by\n\nplaintiffs in similar cases in a similar locality is but one way to\n\nassess whether a plaintiff can recover the jurisdictional amount.\n\nSee, e.g., Felton v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., 324 F.3d 771 (5th Cir.\n\n2003). It should be noted, however, that this method is not always\n\nconclusive.   The fact that no prior plaintiff has recovered the\n\njurisdictional amount for a certain injury does not indicate, to a\n\nlegal certainty, that the plaintiff could not recover that amount.\n\nIn this case, however, federal juries in Puerto Rico have returned\n\nverdicts far in excess of the jurisdictional amount for injuries\n\nsimilar to plaintiffs'.\n\n          In Havinga v. Crowley Towing and Transp. Co., 24 F.3d\n\n1480 (1st Cir. 1994), we upheld awards ranging from $200,000 to\n\n$450,000 per plaintiff for pain and suffering and loss of capacity\n\nfor enjoyment of life. In Havinga, the plaintiffs' boat was struck\n\nby a barge, forcing plaintiffs to abandon ship and await rescue at\n\nnight in shark-infested waters. The plaintiffs presented their own\n\ntestimony regarding their pain and suffering, supplemented with the\n\ntestimony of a psychologist.   Though the plaintiffs did not suffer\n\nphysical injury, we upheld the damage awards.   See also Grajales-\n\nRomero, 194 F.3d at 288 (holding that an award of $150,000 was not\n\nexcessive where plaintiff produced medical evidence of neck pains\n\nand loss of cognitive functions resulting from a sign falling on\n\nplaintiff's head); Smith v. Kmart Corp., 177 F.3d 19 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f1999) (holding that an award of $500,000 was not excessive where\n\nplaintiff produced medical and psychological evidence of trauma and\n\ncontinued pain resulting from a cooler falling on plaintiff's\n\nhead); Mejías-Quirós, 108 F.3d at 425 (holding that an award of\n\n$200,000 for pain and suffering was not excessive where plaintiff\n\nproduced   medical   testimony   about    continuing   headaches,      mild\n\ndepression, low self-esteem, and post-traumatic stress).            These\n\ncases are not on all fours with this case, but demonstrate that it\n\nis not legally certain that a jury could not make an award of\n\n$75,000.\n\n           Both   plaintiffs   suffered   physical   injuries   from    the\n\naccident that resulted in permanent impairment to their total\n\nbodily functions.    In addition, they had to cope with the mental\n\nanguish of spending their honeymoon in a hospital, Ramírez being\n\nunable to breast feed their first child, and being unable to have\n\nintimate contact with one another during the first three months of\n\nmarriage. Medical reports indicate that the plaintiffs may require\n\nfuture medical and psychological care.      These facts, when compared\n\nto comparable federal jury cases, indicate that it is not a legal\n\ncertainty that their individual claims involve less than $75,000.1\n\n\n1\n   Defendants also argue that part of plaintiffs' complaint was\nmade in bad faith because it incorrectly claims that the couple cut\ntheir honeymoon short to receive medical treatment and that they\nlost time from work to receive medical treatment when, in fact,\nthey never received the additional treatment. We do not find it\nnecessary to address this issue because plaintiffs reach the\njurisdictional amount without considering the additional medical\n\n                                  -10-\n\f                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court and remand for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.\n\n          Vacated and Remanded.\n\n\n\n\ntreatment they may or may not have had. See St. Paul, 303 U.S. at\n289-90 (discussing that a suit will be dismissed for bad faith\ndamage allegations only when such claims are essential to reach the\njurisdictional amount).\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

Further, Ramírez's injuries limited the amount of work\n\nshe could perform at her job.\n\n             A medical examination conducted a little less than two\n\nyears    after    the    crash    reported         that   Ramírez     suffers    from   a\n\npermanent       incapacity       of    3%     of    her     bodily    functions.        A\n\npsychological      examination         conducted      one    year    after     the   crash\n\nestimated       that    Ramírez       requires      intensive       psychotherapy      and\n\nmedication for one year.\n\n             Keith Stewart suffered whiplash as a result of the crash.\n\nA medical examination conducted a little less than two years after\n\nthe     crash     reported       that       Stewart       suffered     from     cervical\n\nparavertebral muscle strain and that the crash caused Stewart to\n\nhave    7%   permanent     impairment         of   his    total     bodily    functions.\n\nStewart alleges that the injuries hinder his ability to work as a\n\nNew York policeman and prevented him from having intimate contact\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fwith his wife for about two to three months.             A psychological\n\nexamination conducted a year after the crash reported that Stewart\n\nsuffered intense emotional trauma.        The psychologist recommended\n\nintensive psychotherapy and medication for approximately one year.\n\n                            II.

Where there are\n\nmultiple plaintiffs, each must allege a claim that is in excess of\n\n$75,000.   See Clark v.

Rather, the dispute turns on whether the damages exceed\n\n$75,000.\n\n           Since   plaintiffs    seek    to   invoke   federal   diversity\n\njurisdiction, they have the burden of showing that their claims\n\nmeet the amount-in-controversy requirement.        Spielman, 251 F.3d at\n\n4.   The longstanding test for determining whether a party has met\n\nthe amount-in-controversy states that:\n\n           The rule governing dismissal for want of\n           jurisdiction in cases brought in the federal\n           court is that, unless the law gives a\n           different rule, the sum claimed by the\n\n                                   -4-\n\f           plaintiff controls if the claim is apparently\n           made in good faith.

Thus, plaintiffs had\n\nthe burden of alleging facts indicating that it is not a legal\n\ncertainty that their individual claims involve less than $75,000.\n\nTo meet this burden, Diana Ramírez produced written interrogatories\n\ndocumenting her injuries and pain, a medical report concluding that\n\nRamírez suffered a 3% permanent impairment and was at risk of\n\ndeveloping cervical spondylosis as a result of the accident, and a\n\npsychological   evaluation      documenting     her    emotional   trauma   and\n\nrecommending      intensive       psychotherapy       and    medication     for\n\napproximately one year.\n\n          Keith       Stewart      produced     written       interrogatories\n\ndocumenting his injuries, pain, and difficulty performing his job\n\nas a New York policeman, a medical report concluding that Stewart\n\nsuffered a 7% permanent impairment, and a psychological evaluation\n\ndocumenting    his    emotional    trauma     and   recommending    intensive\n\npsychotherapy and medication for approximately one year.\n\n          The        district      court,      after        considering     the\n\ninterrogatories, medical reports, and psychological evaluations,\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fconcluded that the plaintiffs failed to submit facts indicating\n\nthat it was not a legal certainty that their individual claims\n\ninvolved less than $75,000.      We disagree.\n\n           In reaching its conclusions, the district court examined\n\npersonal injury cases from the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, most of\n\nwhich were over forty years old, which awarded damages, adjusted\n\nfor inflation, far below $75,000 for injuries similar to those\n\nsuffered by the plaintiffs.

In our view, the district court's\n\ndecision constituted error.\n\n           Using Puerto Rico Supreme Court cases to analyze the\n\namount-in-controversy for diversity purposes is the equivalent of\n\ncomparing apples and oranges.      Damages in a Puerto Rico civil case\n\nare determined by a judge, not a jury.      In contrast, in the federal\n\ncourts,   \"[t]he   task   of   estimating   money   damages,   especially\n\nintangible, noneconomic loss, constitutes a core jury function.\"\n\nDavignon v.

See Grajales-Romero v.

We\n\nlikewise hold that in determining the amount-in-controversy, a\n\nfederal district court should not be constrained by the amounts\n\nawarded by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico.\n\n          We believe, based on the evidence, that the plaintiffs\n\nmet their burden of alleging facts indicating that it is not a\n\nlegal certainty that their claims involve less than $75,000.     This\n\nbecomes clear after examining cases, affirmed by this court, in\n\nwhich federal juries in Puerto Rico returned verdicts for injuries\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fsimilar to plaintiffs'.    Taking notice of amounts recovered by\n\nplaintiffs in similar cases in a similar locality is but one way to\n\nassess whether a plaintiff can recover the jurisdictional amount.\n\nSee, e.g., Felton v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"30571\"><a href=\"/opinion/30571/felton-v-greyhound-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir.\n\n2003). It should be noted, however, that this method is not always\n\nconclusive.   The fact that no prior plaintiff has recovered the\n\njurisdictional amount for a certain injury does not indicate, to a\n\nlegal certainty, that the plaintiff could not recover that amount.\n\nIn this case, however, federal juries in Puerto Rico have returned\n\nverdicts far in excess of the jurisdictional amount for injuries\n\nsimilar to plaintiffs'.\n\n          In Havinga v. Crowley Towing and Transp.

In Havinga, the plaintiffs' boat was struck\n\nby a barge, forcing plaintiffs to abandon ship and await rescue at\n\nnight in shark-infested waters. The plaintiffs presented their own\n\ntestimony regarding their pain and suffering, supplemented with the\n\ntestimony of a psychologist.   Though the plaintiffs did not suffer\n\nphysical injury, we upheld the damage awards.   See also Grajales-\n\nRomero, 194 F.3d at 288 (holding that an award of $150,000 was not\n\nexcessive where plaintiff produced medical evidence of neck pains\n\nand loss of cognitive functions resulting from a sign falling on\n\nplaintiff's head); Smith v.

These\n\ncases are not on all fours with this case, but demonstrate that it\n\nis not legally certain that a jury could not make an award of\n\n$75,000.\n\n           Both   plaintiffs   suffered   physical   injuries   from    the\n\naccident that resulted in permanent impairment to their total\n\nbodily functions.    In addition, they had to cope with the mental\n\nanguish of spending their honeymoon in a hospital, Ramírez being\n\nunable to breast feed their first child, and being unable to have\n\nintimate contact with one another during the first three months of\n\nmarriage. Medical reports indicate that the plaintiffs may require\n\nfuture medical and psychological care.      These facts, when compared\n\nto comparable federal jury cases, indicate that it is not a legal\n\ncertainty that their individual claims involve less than $75,000.1\n\n\n1\n   Defendants also argue that part of plaintiffs' complaint was\nmade in bad faith because it incorrectly claims that the couple cut\ntheir honeymoon short to receive medical treatment and that they\nlost time from work to receive medical treatment when, in fact,\nthey never received the additional treatment.
