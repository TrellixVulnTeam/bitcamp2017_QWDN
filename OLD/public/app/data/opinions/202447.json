Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Kerry M. Castello, on brief pro se.\n     Stephen G. Dietrick, Deputy General Counsel, Legal Division,\nDepartment of Correction and Nancy Ankers White, Special Assistant\nAttorney General, on brief for defendant, appellee Susan J.

Kerry M. Castello, a pro se prisoner,\n\nappeals the district court's entry of summary judgment dismissing\n\nhis civil rights complaint in which he asserts an Eighth Amendment\n\nclaim for deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.\n\nCastello also appeals the district court's denial of his Fed. R.\n\nCiv. Pro. 59(e) motion to alter or amend judgment.          We have\n\ncarefully reviewed the record and affirm substantially for the\n\nreasons stated in the district court's memorandum decision, adding\n\nonly the following.\n\n          Castello was diagnosed with the Hepatitis C virus (\"HCV\")\n\nin October 2001, while incarcerated at MCI-Norfolk. Since at least\n\n2003, when UMass Correctional Health (\"UMCH\") began providing\n\nmedical services for the Massachusetts Department of Corrections,\n\nCastello has demanded that he receive a particular treatment for\n\nhis HCV: a combination drug therapy using pegylated interferon and\n\nribavirin. UMCH has monitored Castello's medical condition through\n\nregular blood tests and a liver biopsy, which have consistently\n\nshown that Castello suffers from a mild form of the disease.\n\n          In October 2003, pursuant to the UMCH Protocol for\n\ntreating inmates with HCV, Castello was placed on the waiting list\n\nfor the combination drug therapy.    Castello has been informed that\n\nbudget constraints limit the number of inmates who can receive the\n\ncombination drug therapy, and those inmates with more severe forms\n\nof the disease have priority on the treatment list.        When the\n\n\n                               -2-\n\fevidentiary record closed in the district court, Castello's medical\n\ncondition remained essentially unchanged and he was still waiting\n\nfor the combination drug therapy.\n\n            On this record, which we have reviewed de novo, indulging\n\nevery inference in Castello's favor, Rathbun v. Autozone, Inc., 361\n\nF.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir. 2004), we agree with the district court's\n\nconclusion   that   Castello   failed   to   show   \"acts   or   omissions\n\nsufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious\n\nmedical needs.\"     Miranda v. Munoz, 770 F.2d 155, 259 (1st Cir.\n\n1985) (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976)).          While\n\nit is clear that Castello strongly disagrees with the medical care\n\nhe is receiving, it is also clear that UMCH is providing \"decent,\n\ntimely heath care ... at a level reasonably commensurate with\n\nmodern medical science and of a quality acceptable within prudent\n\nprofessional standards.\" United States v. DeCologero, 821 F.2d 39,\n\n42 (1st Cir. 1987).    Castello's own evidence, submitted in support\n\nof his summary judgment motions, shows that modern medical science\n\nhas reached a consensus that treatment generally is appropriate for\n\npatients suffering more severe cases of HCV, where a liver biopsy\n\nshows moderate inflammation and necrosis and portal or bridging\n\nfibrosis.      E.g.,   National   Institutes    for   Health     Consensus\n\nDevelopment Statement, \"Management of Hepatitis C: 2002.\"          None of\n\nthese conditions were detected in Castello's liver biopsy. On this\n\nrecord, Castello failed to show that he has suffered an objectively\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fserious deprivation, or that appellees have subjectively acted in\n\n\"wanton disregard\" of his rights.         DesRosiers v. Moran, 949 F.2d\n\n15, 19 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347\n\n(1981)).   See also Bender v. Regier, 385 F.3d 1133, 1135 (8th Cir.\n\n2004) (\"Treatment for [HCV] patients with mild liver problems may\n\nbe safely deferred.\").\n\n           Castello also challenges the district court's refusal to\n\nstrike   the   medical   defendants'1    opposition   to    his   motion   for\n\nsummary judgment and cross-motions for summary judgment, filed two\n\nweeks late, without prior permission or explanation.              Although we\n\ndo not condone such disregard of a court-ordered deadline, where\n\nthere is no showing of repeated failures to adhere to deadlines,\n\nbad faith or prejudice, and the delay is minimal, we find no abuse\n\nof discretion in the district court's actions.         Stonkus v. City of\n\nBrockton School Dep't, 322 F.3d 97, 101 (1st Cir. 2003).             We also\n\nfind no abuse of discretion in the court's refusal to strike the\n\nexhibits attached to defendants' late-filed pleading because of\n\ndefendants' failure to authenticate the exhibits by affidavit, as\n\nrequired by the plain language of Rule 56(e).              Again, we do not\n\ncondone this serious omission, see Carmona v. Toledo, 215 F.3d 124,\n\n131 (1st Cir. 2002), but conclude that because each of the disputed\n\n\n\n     1\n        The \"medical defendants\" are appellees Dr. Lazare, Dr.\nBrewer, and Nurse Brewer, all represented by private counsel.\nAppellee Susan Martin is represented by a Special Assistant\nAttorney General for the Department of Corrections.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fexhibits (except for the Brewer Affidavit, which was properly\n\nauthenticated pursuant to Rule 56(e)) was filed with the court and\n\nproperly authenticated by Castello in support of his summary\n\njudgment pleadings, no purpose would have been served by striking\n\nthe exhibits from this particular pleading.\n\n          Finally, we find no abuse of discretion in the court's\n\ndenial of Castello's Rule 59(e) motion.   The minor factual errors\n\nin the district court's memorandum decision, while unfortunate, are\n\nnot dispositive.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
