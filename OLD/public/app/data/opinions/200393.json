Limar Shipping Ltd. (\"Limar\")\n\nand OMI Corporation (\"OMI\"), plaintiffs-appellants, appeal a grant\n\nof summary judgment in favor of the defendant-appellee the United\n\nStates, in a case alleging, inter alia, that the United States was\n\nnegligent and/or breached warranties in the surveying of the Boston\n\nHarbor and the dissemination of nautical charts that failed to\n\naccurately depict the depth of the harbor.     Plaintiffs claim that\n\nthe erroneous chart resulted in the grounding of and subsequent\n\ndamage to their vessel, the M/T Limar.     Plaintiffs raise two main\n\nissues on appeal, namely, that the district court erred in: (1)\n\nfinding that there is an implied discretionary function exemption\n\nin the Suits in Admiralty Act;    and (2) applying the discretionary\n\nfunction exemption as it did to the facts of this case.        After\n\ncareful review, we affirm the district court’s ruling for the\n\nreasons stated below.\n\n                             I.    Facts\n\n           On the morning of March 11, 1996, the steel hulled\n\ntanker vessel M/T Limar, owned by Limar and operated by OMI,\n\napproached Boston, Massachusetts. Under Massachusetts law, foreign\n\nvessels the size of the M/T Limar must employ a harbor pilot when\n\nentering Boston Harbor.1   See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 103, §§ 21, 28.\n\nAccordingly, the M/T Limar took aboard a harbor pilot, Lawrence\n\n\n1\n  The M/T Limar measured over 545 feet in length and had a beam of\napproximately ninety feet. The M/T Limar’s draft was thirty-three\nfeet, nine inches.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fCannon, who undertook navigation of the ship through the Boston\n\nHarbor shipping channel.\n\n            The main shipping route in the Boston Harbor includes\n\nside-by-side inbound and outbound channels, which are maintained by\n\nthe Army Corps of Engineers (\"Army Corps\").           Congress allocates\n\nfunds to maintain federal shipping channels at certain authorized\n\ndepths and widths.      In 1996, the Army Corps was authorized to\n\ndredge the Boston Harbor inbound channel to a depth of thirty-five\n\nfeet below Mean Low Water, and was also authorized to maintain the\n\noutbound channel at a depth of not more than forty feet.          Both of\n\nthese channels could be maintained up to 600 feet wide.\n\n            The Army Corps conducts periodic surveys of the shipping\n\nchannels to determine their actual depths, as opposed to the\n\nauthorized   depths,   and   to   discover   any   unexpected   debris   or\n\nshoaling.    The results of these surveys are made known to the\n\npublic through Results of Survey Reports and the Coast Guard's\n\nLocal Notice to Mariners publications.        Relevant to this matter,\n\nthe last periodic survey of the disputed area of the inbound\n\nchannel was completed in 1990.        The results of the 1990 Boston\n\nHarbor survey appeared in a Results of Survey Report dated July 23,\n\n1990, and they were published in the First Coast Guard District’s\n\nLocal Notice to Mariners, Number 31, on August 1, 1990.         They also\n\nappeared in a book entitled The Port of Boston, Massachusetts, Port\n\nSeries No. 3, issued in 1994.      In each of these sources, the 1990\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fsurvey reported the controlling depth of the channel, which is the\n\nshallowest point at any place as compared to Mean Low Water.\n\n          Cannon,    a   harbor   pilot    with   twenty-four   years    of\n\nexperience at the time of the grounding, knew these survey results,\n\nand did not bring a nautical chart with him.       Although he had never\n\nbeen aboard the M/T Limar, he familiarized himself with the ship,\n\nand asked the M/T Limar’s crew for the draft of the ship before\n\ndirecting the ship through Boston Harbor.\n\n          While Cannon piloted the vessel, the M/T Limar’s crew\n\nobserved the movement of the ship. Third Mate Rodolfo Arcilla took\n\nperiodic position fixes of the vessel’s location and plotted them\n\non the M/T Limar’s copy of Nautical Chart 13272, 43d Edition, dated\n\nJune 28, 1995. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n\n(\"NOAA\") created this chart using information from several sources,\n\nincluding the 1990 Army Corps survey mentioned above.2\n\n          At 8:50 a.m., the M/T Limar scraped the Boston Harbor\n\nfloor near Red Nunn Buoy No. 8, at approximately 42 20.494' N and\n\n71 00.505' W.   According to the nautical chart produced by NOAA,\n\nthe water depths nearest to the position of the groundings are\n\nthirty-five   and   thirty-six    feet,   which   allegedly   should    have\n\naccommodated the M/T Limar's thirty-three feet, nine inch draft.\n\n\n2\n  The nautical chart contains a warning that states \"[t]he prudent\nmariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation.\" In\naddition, the chart includes several cautions, including one that\nthe \"[t]emporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not\nindicated on this chart. See Notice to Mariners.\"\n\n                                   -4-\n\fThe vessel grounded on the starboard (right) side forebody, but was\n\nstill able to reach its berth.         However, the damage to the hull and\n\nthe ensuing steps taken to prevent oil pollution are alleged to\n\nhave cost Limar and OMI in excess of $800,000.\n\n             Limar and OMI sued the government under the Suits in\n\nAdmiralty Act (\"SAA\"), 46 U.S.C. Appx. §§ 741-52 (1976), alleging\n\nthat the misrepresentation of the water depth on the chart caused\n\nthe damage to the M/T Limar.           The district court granted summary\n\njudgment     in   favor   of    the    United   States,   finding   that   the\n\ndiscretionary function exception applied and that the United States\n\nwas entitled to dismissal of the complaint on grounds of sovereign\n\nimmunity.\n\n                          II.    Standard of Review\n\n             This Court reviews the grant of a summary judgment motion\n\nde novo, considering all facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nnon-moving party, in this case the plaintiffs. Gu v. Boston Police\n\nDept., et al., 312 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                III.   Discussion\n\n             This case involves allegations of negligence on the part\n\nof the United States in the production and dissemination of a\n\nnautical chart.     In order to avoid confusion, we highlight several\n\nkey facts.    The Army Corps conducted a survey of the Boston Harbor,\n\nwhich was later used by NOAA to create a nautical chart of the\n\nharbor.    The plaintiffs argue that the chart failed to accurately\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fdepict the depth of the harbor, and the M/T Limar's grounding was\n\na result of this inaccuracy.      Instead of following what the\n\nplaintiffs allege are mandatory standards, the Army Corps followed\n\nits own guidelines in conducting the survey. The plaintiffs contend\n\nthat the chart's inaccuracy could have been prevented if NOAA had\n\nbased the chart on a survey that was conducted in accordance with\n\nNOAA's standards for hydrographic surveys.       Specifically, the\n\nplaintiffs argue that if the nautical chart had been based on a\n\nsurvey conducted in compliance with NOAA guidelines, it would have\n\nbeen more accurate because those guidelines require measurements on\n\ntighter sounding intervals and line spacing than those called for\n\nby the Army Corps guidelines.    According to the plaintiffs, the\n\nArmy Corps should have followed the NOAA requirements in conducting\n\nits initial survey because it knew that NOAA would rely on the\n\nsurvey in creating nautical charts.   NOAA did in fact use the Army\n\nCorps survey, in conjunction with other sources, to create the\n\nchart.   Thus, plaintiffs allege two grounds of liability: (1) the\n\nArmy Corps decision to follow its own guidelines rather than the\n\nNOAA guidelines in conducting the survey; and (2) NOAA's decision\n\nto create a chart based on that survey.\n\n          Plaintiffs urge us to hold that the United States has\n\ncompletely waived sovereign immunity in the SAA, and consequently\n\nthat no discretionary function exception exists in this context.\n\nIn the event we find that there is such an exception, plaintiffs\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fargue that the exception should not apply to the decisions made by\n\nthe Army Corps and NOAA, and that the United States should be\n\nsubject to suit, because the decisions were non-discretionary. The\n\nfinal argument      offered   by    plaintiffs   is   that    even   if   NOAA's\n\ndecision to rely on the Army Corps survey was a discretionary\n\ndecision, once that decision was made, the government entity had a\n\nduty of care to create the chart accurately. Plaintiffs argue that\n\nsince mariners regularly rely on such charts for navigation,\n\nmisrepresentation as to the depth of the harbor is grounds for\n\nliability.\n\n          In response, defendants argue that the actions by both\n\nthe Army Corps and NOAA are discretionary decisions that fall\n\nwithin the implied discretionary function exception to the SAA.\n\nThus, defendants argue the United States is protected from suit by\n\nsovereign immunity.\n\nA.   Existence of the Implied Discretionary Function Exception\n\n             We   begin   with     the    threshold   issue    of    whether   a\n\ndiscretionary function exception should be implied in the context\n\nof the SAA.       Unless such an exception can be implied, waiver of\n\nsovereign immunity by the United States would allow the plaintiffs'\n\nsuit to proceed.\n\n             The United States, as sovereign, is immune from suit\n\nunless it waives its sovereign immunity and consents to be sued.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Thompson, 98 U.S. 486, 489 (1878).\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fAbsent express waiver of sovereign immunity, federal courts lack\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction over suits against the United States.\n\nUnited States v. Sherwood, 312 U.S. 584, 586 (1941).                             In the SAA,\n\nthe United States waives its sovereign immunity from suit for\n\nmaritime torts committed by its agents.                See 46 U.S.C. Appx. § 742;\n\nGercey v. United States, 540 F.2d 536, 539 (1st Cir. 1976).\n\n              The SAA contains no express exceptions to the waiver of\n\nsovereign immunity.           In contrast, the Federal Torts Claims Act\n\n(\"FTCA\"), 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b), which waives sovereign immunity for\n\ntort   claims       against   the     United     States,          contains       an   express\n\nexception      to    shield     the    \"discretion           of     the     executive      or\n\nadministrator to act according to one's judgment of the best\n\ncourse.\" Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S. 15, 34 (1953).                             This\n\ndiscretionary        function   exception        serves       to    prevent       \"judicial\n\n'second-guessing'        of   legislative        and    administrative            decisions\n\ngrounded in social, economic, and political policy.\" United States\n\nv. S.A. Empresa de Viacao Aerea Rio Grandense (Varig Airlines), 467\n\nU.S.   797,    814    (1984).       This    Court      has    held        that    a   similar\n\n\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fdiscretionary function exception is to be implied into the SAA.3\n\nSee Gercey, 540 F.2d at 539.\n\n           We   decline   plaintiffs'   invitation   to   reconsider   our\n\ndecision in Gercey, and reaffirm the principles set forth therein.\n\nCongress did not intend, by passing the SAA, to create a system\n\nwherein all administrative decisions concerning maritime matters\n\nare second-guessed and subject to judicial review.           Gercey, 540\n\nF.2d at 539. Absence of an \"express Congressional directive to the\n\ncontrary\" will not be read as a green light for federal courts to\n\n\n3\n    In Gercey, this court held that\n\n      the [SAA] does not contain an express exemption for harm\n      caused by the exercise of \"discretionary functions\", a\n      category which includes, and probably should be limited\n      to, basic \"policy judgments as to the public interest.\"\n      Although the [SAA] contains no express exception, we\n      think that sound principles demand that the act be\n      construed as subject to such discretionary function\n      exception. Were there no such immunity for basic policy\n      making decisions, all administrative and legislative\n      decisions concerning the public interest in maritime\n      matters would be subject to independent judicial review\n      in the not unlikely event that the implementation of\n      those policy judgments were to cause private injuries.\n\nId. at 539 (emphasis added) (citations and footnote omitted). The\nother circuit courts that have considered this issue have also\nconcluded that the \"SAA’s waiver of immunity is subject to the\ndiscretionary function exception.\" Mid-South Holding Co., Inc. v.\nUnited States, 225 F.3d 1201, 1204 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing Tew v.\nUnited States, 86 F.3d 1003, 1005 (10th Cir. 1996) (providing case\nlaw from ten different circuits, including this one, supporting the\nexistence of an implied discretionary function in the SAA)).\nPlaintiffs point to Lane v. United States, 529 F.2d 175 (4th Cir.\n1975), in support of their argument that the discretionary function\nexception does not apply in the SAA context. The Fourth Circuit,\nhowever, now agrees that the exception should be read into the SAA.\nTiffany v. United States, 931 F.2d 271, 277 (4th Cir. 1991).\n\n                                  -9-\n\fassume   power   to   review   \"all   administrative   and   legislative\n\ndecisions concerning the public interest in maritime matters.\" Id.\n\nThe district court did not err in applying well-established law\n\nimplying a discretionary function exception to the SAA.\n\nB.   Applicability of the Implied Discretionary Function Exception\n\n           Given that there is an implied discretionary function\n\nexception to the SAA, we turn to the argument that the district\n\ncourt misapplied the exception to the facts of the case at bar. As\n\nin the FTCA context, the implied discretionary function exception\n\nto the SAA \"insulates the Government from liability if the action\n\nchallenged in the case involves the permissible exercise of policy\n\njudgment.\"   Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 537 (1988).\n\nPlaintiffs suggest that the actions of the Army Corps and NOAA fail\n\nto meet the discretionary function exception's applicability test\n\nand that the United States is therefore subject to suit.\n\n          In Berkovitz, the Supreme Court set forth a two-part test\n\nto determine whether the discretionary function exception bars a\n\nsuit against the United States.4         486 U.S. at 535-37.   First, a\n\n\n4\n  In Berkovitz, the Supreme Court was specifically addressing the\ndiscretionary function exception to the FTCA. 486 U.S. at 533. We\nhold that the Berkovitz test applies in cases involving the implied\ndiscretionary function exception to the SAA. Other courts have\napplied the Berkovitz test when analyzing the issue of the\napplicability of the discretionary function exception in a suit\nbrought under the SAA. See, e.g., Theriot v. U.S., 245 F.3d 388,\n397 (5th Cir. 1998); Cassens v. St. Louis River Cruise Lines, Inc.,\n44 F.3d 508, 511-14 (7th Cir. 1995).        Furthermore, there is\nevidence on the record that both parties agreed that if the\ndiscretionary function exception applies, it is subject to the\n\n                                  -10-\n\fcourt must determine if the challenged conduct involves an element\n\nof judgment, meaning that \"the action is a matter of choice for the\n\nacting employee.\"       Id. at 536.     Second, \"a court must determine\n\nwhether that     judgment   is   of   the    kind   that    the   discretionary\n\nfunction exception was designed to shield,\" meaning it involved\n\n\"governmental actions and decisions based on considerations of\n\npublic policy.\"    Id.\n\n1. Applicability of the Discretionary Function Exception to the\nArmy Corps' Survey\n\n          It is well established that \"the discretionary function\n\nexception will not apply when a federal statute, regulation, or\n\npolicy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee\n\nto follow.\" See Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536.             However, if there is\n\nno mandatory regulation that requires a particular course of\n\naction, then the discretionary function exception can apply.                 Id.\n\nHere, plaintiffs    argue    that     the    Army   Corps   failed   to   follow\n\nmandatory internal procedures requiring its survey of the Boston\n\nHarbor to be conducted in accordance with NOAA guidelines. Because\n\nthey   contend   that    compliance     with    the    NOAA   guidelines     was\n\nmandatory,   plaintiffs     claim     that    the    discretionary    function\n\nexception cannot protect the United States from suit. We disagree.\n\n           No mandatory internal procedures or directives required\n\nthe Army Corps to adhere to the NOAA guidelines in conducting its\n\n\n\nanalysis of the Berkovitz test.\n\n                                      -11-\n\fsurvey of the Boston Harbor, thus the \"element of judgment\" prong\n\nof the Berkovitz test is met.         The Army Corps generally follows its\n\nown manual when it performs oceanic surveys, and there is no\n\ndispute that the Army Corps' Hydrographic Surveying: Engineer\n\nManual (1994) (\"Army Corps Manual\") applies to hydrographic surveys\n\nplanned    and   performed     by   the   Army    Corps    and    sets    forth    the\n\napplicable procedures.         Army Corps Manual at 1-4 (stating that\n\n\"manual    establishes       standard       procedures,         minimum    accuracy\n\nrequirements,       instrumentation       and   equipment       requirements,      and\n\nquality control criteria for hydrographic surveys\").                       The Army\n\nCorps Manual states:\n\n            This manual is intended to cover only those\n            engineering and construction survey activities\n            which support typical river, harbor, harbor\n            approach channel, or inland waterway projects.\n            . . . [it] does not cover classical\n            hydrographic surveying functions which are\n            more   traditionally   associated   with   the\n            preparation of nautical charts.          These\n            procedures   are   detailed   in   the   [NOAA\n            Hydrographic Manual].\n\nArmy Corps Manual at 1-4(b).              Here, the parties agreed and the\n\ndistrict court found that the Army Corps conducted the Boston\n\nHarbor survey as a \"condition survey,\" which is a periodic survey\n\ncarried out \"to determine the present condition of navigation\n\nchannels    [and]    underwater     features,      but    is    not   a   survey    in\n\nconjunction with the preparation of a nautical chart.\"                    Army Corps\n\nManual at 2-10.       There is no mandatory language in the Army Corps\n\nManual    indicating    that    the   Army      Corps    must    follow    the    NOAA\n\n                                      -12-\n\fguidelines when carrying out a condition survey, even if it is\n\naware that such a survey may be used by other agencies to prepare\n\nnautical charts -- what matters is the purpose of the survey at the\n\ntime it is conducted by the Army Corps.5         Since the purpose of the\n\nsurvey at the time it was conducted was to determine the condition\n\nof the harbor rather than to chart its depth, the Army Corps was\n\nunder no obligation to comply with NOAA guidelines.\n\n           Having found that the choice to conduct the condition\n\nsurvey   according   to    the   Army   Corps   guidelines   constituted   a\n\ndiscretionary choice, we now turn to the second part of the\n\nBerkovitz test and consider whether that decision is of the type\n\nthe discretionary function exception was designed to protect.\n\nBerkovitz, 486 U.S. at 537.\n\n           Where \"a regulation allows the employee discretion, the\n\nvery existence of the regulation creates a strong presumption that\n\na   discretionary    act    authorized     by   the   regulation   involves\n\nconsideration of the same policies which led to the promulgation of\n\nthe regulations.\"6     United States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 347\n\n\n5\n   Plaintiffs argue that the purpose of the 1990 survey is a\ndisputed issue of material fact. As we stated above, however, both\nparties conceded the survey was indeed a condition survey and thus\nnot a survey conducted for the purpose of creating a nautical\nchart.\n6\n  The fact that we are concerned here with internal procedures and\nguidelines, as embodied in the Army Corps Manual, rather than with\nfederal statutes or regulations does not change our analysis. The\nGaubert presumption applies to internal procedures:\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f(1991).    Plaintiff bears the burden of rebutting this presumption\n\nand demonstrating that the conduct at issue is not policy-based.\n\nSee Wood v. United States, 290 F.3d 29, 37 (1st Cir. 2002).               Here,\n\nthe plaintiffs fail to meet this burden.                Indeed the Corps'\n\ndecision to follow its own less stringent guidelines is most likely\n\na choice aimed to maximize efficient use of resources, and is thus\n\npolicy-based.      See,   e.g.,   Varig     Airlines,    467      U.S.   at   820\n\n(recognizing the efficient allocation of agency resources as a\n\npolicy choice).\n\n2. Applicability of the Discretionary Function Exception to NOAA's\nuse of the Army Corps Survey in Creating the Chart\n\n           This leaves only the argument that once NOAA made the\n\ndecision   to   create    a   chart,   it   had   a   duty   to    produce     it\n\naccurately.7    In Indian Towing Co. v. United States, 350 U.S. 61\n\n\n     Not all agencies issue comprehensive regulations,\n     however. Some establish policy on a case-by-case basis,\n     whether through adjudicatory proceedings or through\n     administration of agency programs. Others promulgate\n     regulations on some topics, but not on others. In\n     addition, an agency may rely on internal guidelines\n     rather than on published regulations. . . . When\n     established governmental policy, as expressed or implied\n     by statute, regulation, or agency guidelines, allows a\n     Government agent to exercise discretion, it must be\n     presumed that the agent's acts are grounded in policy\n     when exercising that discretion.\n\nGaubert, 499 U.S. at 324.\n7\n  The argument depends on the assumption that the chart would have\nbeen accurate had it been based on a survey conducted under the\nmore stringent NOAA standards.    It is unclear to us that this\nargument was presented by appellants on appeal, but we will assume\narguendo that it remains a viable argument.\n\n                                   -14-\n\f(1955),   the    Supreme    Court    held   the   United   States   liable   for\n\nnegligently maintaining a lighthouse built by the Coast Guard. Id.\n\nat 69.      Mariners relied on the lighthouse for navigation and\n\nplaintiff's ship was damaged when it ran aground because the light\n\nwent out.    Id. at 62.     The Indian Towing Court indicated that once\n\nthe Coast Guard exercised its discretion to operate the lighthouse,\n\nit was under an obligation to do so with reasonable care.               Id. at\n\n68.   We find that Indian Towing can be distinguished from the\n\ninstant   case    because    there    the    government    conceded   that   the\n\ndiscretionary function exception did not apply.               Id. at 64.     In\n\nthis case, however, the government vigorously argues, and we agree,\n\nthat the decision by NOAA to use the Corps' data to create the\n\nchart was discretionary and was thus the type of decision the\n\ndiscretionary function exception was meant to protect.8\n\n            The \"element of judgment\" prong of the Berkovitz test is\n\nsatisfied because NOAA's decision to use the Army Corps survey in\n\nfact contains an element of judgment.                 As stated above, the\n\ndiscretionary      function    applies       unless   a    \"federal   statute,\n\nregulation or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for\n\nan employee to follow.\" Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 537; accord Wood,\n\n\n\n8\n   Appellants have not challenged NOAA's actual use of the Corps'\ndata as negligent, but rather have chosen to challenge NOAA's\ndecision to use the Corps' data to create the nautical chart.\nIndian Towing would only apply in the former case, where once NOAA\nexercised its discretion to use the Corps' data it had to do so in\na non-negligent manner.\n\n                                      -15-\n\f290 F.3d at 36. Nowhere in NOAA’s Hydrographic Manual are employees\n\ndirected to use as the basis for charts only surveys conducted by\n\nNOAA or by other entities following NOAA’s guidelines.                In fact,\n\nthe manual only stipulates that if NOAA itself conducts a survey,\n\nit must conform with the manual's specific directives.               Here, NOAA\n\ndid not conduct the 1990 survey of the Boston Harbor which formed\n\nthe basis for the chart.        Since there is no specific regulation,\n\nand    thus    no   mandatory   language       either   (1)   directing    the\n\ncartographer as to the surveys that ought to be used when making a\n\nchart, or (2) prohibiting use of non-NOAA conforming surveys in\n\ncreation of a chart, it was within the cartographer’s discretion to\n\nuse the survey made by the Army Corps. See Baird v. United States,\n\n653 F.2d 437, 441 (10th Cir. 1981).\n\n              Plaintiffs cite In re Glacier Bay, 71 F.3d 1447 (9th Cir.\n\n1995) in support of their argument that the discretionary function\n\ndoes   not    apply   here   because    NOAA    did   not   follow   mandatory\n\nprocedures regarding hydrographic surveys.              Glacier Bay involved\n\nthe grounding of a vessel on a rock that was omitted from the\n\nnautical chart.       Id. at 1449-50.    In that case, the Ninth Circuit\n\nallowed a negligence suit against the government to proceed because\n\nNOAA did not comply with its internal guidelines in conducting the\n\nsurvey for the chart.        See id. at 1453 (holding that the \"general\n\ngrant of discretion was superseded by mandatory requirements\" and\n\nthus \"the discretionary exception function [sic] does not apply\").\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fThe   Glacier    Bay    case      dealt   with    surveys   conducted   by   NOAA\n\nhydrographers for the purpose of preparing nautical charts. Id. at\n\n1450. Glacier Bay is inapposite, however, because this case deals\n\nwith NOAA's decision to use an Army Corps condition survey for the\n\npreparation of a chart rather than with NOAA's failure to follow\n\nits   own   procedures       in   conducting     an   independent   hydrographic\n\nsurvey.\n\n             The second requirement of the Berkovitz test, that the\n\njudgment is the type the discretionary function was designed to\n\nprotect, is also satisfied with respect to NOAA's decision.                   The\n\nallocation of resources for the production and dissemination of\n\nocean charts by a budget-constrained entity like NOAA is a policy\n\ndecision that falls within the ambit of the discretionary function\n\nexception.      Allocation of resources and budget management involve\n\nprioritizing and are quintessentially policy-based choices.                   See\n\nVarig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 820; Weissich v. United States, 4 F.3d\n\n810, 813 (9th Cir. 1993) (finding budget and personnel allocation\n\ndecisions fall within discretionary function exception); Chute v.\n\nUnited States, 610 F.2d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 1979) (indicating the\n\nallocation of resources among competing priorities is a policy\n\nfunction).      If this Court were to agree with plaintiffs, we would\n\nbe second-guessing NOAA's policy decision and would be going\n\nagainst the clear intent of the implied discretionary function\n\nexception,      which   is    \"to   prevent      judicial   second-guessing    of\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\flegislative    and   administrative   decisions       grounded   in    social,\n\neconomic, and political policy.\"           Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536-37\n\n(quoting Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814).\n\n          Because NOAA’s decision to rely on the Army Corps' survey\n\nfor the creation of its chart was a policy-based discretionary\n\ndecision, the discretionary function exception applies.           Given the\n\napplicability of the discretionary function exception to both the\n\nArmy Corps and NOAA decisions, we find that the United States has\n\nnot waived sovereign immunity and cannot be subjected to suit in\n\nthis matter.    See Wood, 290 F.3d at 33-34.\n\n          Even if the decision to use the Corps' survey is not\n\nprotected by the discretionary function exception, we find that no\n\nliability attaches here.         Indian Towing does not stand for the\n\nproposition that once the United States undertakes a function, such\n\nas production of a nautical chart, \"the most effective and best\n\nmeans must always be selected.\"       Chute, 610 F.2d at 17.          Instead,\n\nthe general principle gleaned from Indian Towing is that \"the\n\ngovernment must not mislead, and must not induce reliance upon a\n\nbelief that it is providing something which, in fact, it is not\n\nproviding.\"    United States v. Sandra & Dennis Fishing Corp., 372\n\nF.2d 189, 195 (1st Cir. 1967).\n\n          Here, the government cannot be held liable under the\n\nprinciples    established   by    Indian    Towing,    because   (1)    it   is\n\nunreasonable for mariners to rely solely on the chart; and (2) in\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fthe alternative, the government did not create the danger in the\n\nBoston Harbor.    In order for Indian Towing to apply, the chart\n\nwould need to induce reasonable reliance on the part of mariners.\n\nSee Whitney Steamship Co. v. United States, 747 F.2d 69, 78 (2d\n\nCir. 1984) (Tenney, J., dissenting) (arguing that Indian Towing\n\napplies only where reliance is reasonable).     Given the constant\n\npossibility that silting or other events may alter the depth of the\n\nharbor at any given point, reliance on a year-old chart was\n\nunreasonable.    Further, the state law requirement that foreign\n\nvessels employ a special harbor pilot in the Boston Harbor suggests\n\nthat at least the Massachusetts legislature believed that reliance\n\non the accuracy of a chart is unreasonable.     Were such reliance\n\nreasonable, then nautical charts alone would be sufficient for\n\nnavigation, and presumably a mariner inexperienced with the Boston\n\nHarbor would be able to maneuver a vessel safely through its waters\n\nby simply using a chart.\n\n          Even if there were no statutory requirement for an\n\nexperienced harbor pilot, the prudent mariner does not rely on\n\ncharts alone when navigating a body of water.   See, e.g., Sheridan\n\nTransp. Co. v. United States, 897 F.2d 795, 798 (5th Cir. 1990)\n\n(\"aids to navigation do not exist in a vacuum and there are various\n\ndocuments which a mariner must use to determine whether he is\n\njustified in relying on an aid\"); Tidewater Marine, Inc. v. Sanco\n\nInt'l, Inc., 113 F. Supp. 2d 987, 997 (E.D. La. 2000) (\"Buoys,\n\n\n                               -19-\n\fradar, Loran, charts, Notices to Mariners, and lookouts are all\n\naids to navigation. None of these alone can be considered absolute\n\nindicators of sea conditions.\").   Here, the chart itself contained\n\nprominent warnings that mariners should look to other sources for\n\nup-to-date information about the harbor.   Because a mariner cannot\n\nreasonably rely solely on a chart, nautical charts do not induce\n\nreliance such that the government has a duty to ensure their\n\naccuracy, especially where the government specifically directs\n\nmariners to other publications through warnings or cautions on the\n\nchart itself.9\n\n\n9\n    The Fifth Circuit takes a different position:\n\n      [Nautical charts] are not just casual publications which\n      may be of interest to or fall into the hands of an\n      indeterminate number of users. These charts are published\n      by the Government with the certain knowledge that they\n      (i) will be disseminated through reliable channels to\n      ships and crews and (ii) will be relied on as accurate\n      portrayals   of  the   waters   covered.   Indeed,   this\n      expectation is mandated as a rule of prudent conduct on\n      the part of shipowners. Sailing without a chart or with\n      an obsolete one ranks as more than a mere indiscretion.\n      Many Courts have found such ships to be unseaworthy.\n      Others have found mariners who follow such practice\n      guilty of \"glaring\" or \"gross\" fault.\n\n      What the maritime law exacts of shipowner through\n      decisions of admiralty courts may hardly be ignored by\n      the Executive Agency responsible for such charts. The\n      Government must therefore bear the burden of using due\n      care in the preparation and dissemination of such charts\n      and notices.\n\nDe Bardeleben Marine Corp. v. United States, 451 F.2d 140, 148-49\n(5th Cir. 1971) (footnotes omitted).      While the Fifth Circuit\nbelieves the government has a duty to produce charts with due care,\nit goes on to say that \"the Government's obligation ceases at that\n\n                                -20-\n\f          Where the government does not create a danger but rather\n\nonly fails to \"render adequate performance,\" liability does not\n\nattach.   Brown v. United States, 790 F.2d 199 (1st Cir. 1986)\n\n(distinguishing Indian Towing, where \"the government created a\n\ndanger by representing that an operating lighthouse was present\"\n\nfrom cases where the government does not itself create the danger,\n\nas in the case where the government issues weather advisories but\n\ndoes not control the weather). Here, the government did not create\n\nthe dangers of the Boston Harbor, but merely undertook to produce\n\na chart depicting the depths of the harbor.\n\n                         IV.   Conclusion\n\n          For the above-stated reasons, this Court affirms the\n\njudgment of the lower court.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\ntime in which a prudent shipowner-navigator would have reasonably\nreceived the Notice to Mariner.\"      Id. at 149.    We believe an\nadequate warning, such as a Notice to Mariners, regarding possible\ninaccuracies in a chart \"may absolve the [government] of liability\"\nbecause \"the navigator would no longer be entitled to rely on the\n[navigational] aid.\" Whitney Steamship, 747 F.2d, at 78 (Tenney,\nJ., dissenting). Thus, where, as here, mariners are warned to look\nto recent Notices to Mariners for the latest information regarding\na waterway, the due care obligation is met.\n\n                               -21-\n\f",

Plaintiffs claim that the erroneous chart resulted in the grounding of and subsequent damage to their vessel, the <i>M/T Limar.</i> Plaintiffs raise two main issues on appeal, namely, that the district court erred in: (1) finding that there is an implied discretionary function exemption in the Suits in Admiralty Act; and (2) applying the discretionary function exemption as it did to the facts of this case. After careful review, we affirm the district court's ruling for the reasons stated below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of March 11, 1996, the steel hulled tanker vessel <i>M/T Limar,</i> owned by Limar and operated by OMI, approached Boston, Massachusetts. Under Massachusetts law, foreign vessels the size of the <i>M/T Limar</i> must employ a harbor pilot when entering Boston Harbor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 103, &#167;&#167; 21, 28. Accordingly, the <i>M/T Limar</i> took aboard a harbor pilot, Lawrence Cannon, who undertook navigation of the ship through the Boston Harbor shipping channel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main shipping route in the Boston Harbor includes side-by-side inbound and outbound channels, which are maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers (\"Army Corps\"). Congress allocates funds to maintain federal shipping channels at certain authorized depths and widths. In 1996, the Army Corps was authorized to dredge the Boston Harbor inbound channel to a depth of thirty-five feet below Mean Low Water, and was also authorized to maintain the outbound channel at a depth of not more than forty feet. Both of these channels could be maintained up to 600 feet wide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Army Corps conducts periodic surveys of the shipping channels to determine their actual depths, as opposed to the authorized depths, and to discover any unexpected debris or shoaling. The results of these surveys are made known to the public through <i>Results of Survey Reports</i> and the Coast Guard's <i>Local Notice to Mariners</i> publications. Relevant to this matter, the last periodic survey of the disputed area of the inbound channel was completed in 1990. The results of the 1990 Boston Harbor survey appeared in a <i>Results of Survey Report</i> dated July 23, 1990, and they were published in the First Coast Guard District's <i>Local Notice to Mariners,</i> Number 31, on August 1, 1990. They also appeared in a book entitled <i>The Port of Boston, Massachusetts, Port Series No. 3,</i> issued in 1994. In each of these sources, the 1990 survey reported the controlling depth of the channel, which is the shallowest point at any place as compared to Mean Low Water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cannon, a harbor pilot with twenty-four years of experience at the time of the grounding, knew these survey results, and did not bring a nautical chart with him. Although he had never been aboard the <i>M/T Limar,</i> he familiarized himself with the ship, and asked the <i>M/T Limar's</i> crew for the draft of the ship before directing the ship through Boston Harbor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Cannon piloted the vessel, the <i>M/T Limar's</i> crew observed the movement of the ship. Third Mate Rodolfo Arcilla took periodic position fixes of the vessel's location and plotted them on the <i>M/T Limar's copy</i> of Nautical Chart 13272, 43d Edition, dated June 28, 1995. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (\"NOAA\") created this chart using information from several sources, including the 1990 Army Corps survey mentioned above.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 8:50 a.m., the <i>M/T Limar</i> scraped the Boston Harbor floor near Red Nunn Buoy No. 8, at approximately 42 20.494' N and 71 00.505' W. According to the nautical chart produced by NOAA, the water depths nearest to the position of the groundings are thirty-five and thirty-six feet, which allegedly should have accommodated the <i>M/T Limar's</i> thirty-three feet, nine inch draft. The vessel grounded on the starboard (right) side forebody, but was still able to reach its berth. However, the damage to the hull and the ensuing steps taken to prevent oil pollution are alleged to have cost Limar and OMI in excess of $800,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Limar and OMI sued the government under the Suits in Admiralty Act (\"SAA\"), 46 U.S.C.

Boston Police Dept., et al.,</i> 312 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involves allegations of negligence on the part of the United States in the production and dissemination of a nautical chart. In order to avoid confusion, we highlight several key facts. The Army Corps conducted a survey of the Boston Harbor, which was later used by NOAA to create a nautical chart of the harbor. The plaintiffs argue that the chart failed to accurately depict the depth of the harbor, and the <i>M/T Limar's</i> grounding was a result of this inaccuracy. Instead of following what the plaintiffs allege are mandatory standards, the Army Corps followed its own guidelines in conducting the survey. The plaintiffs contend that the chart's inaccuracy could have been prevented if NOAA had based the chart on a survey that was conducted in accordance with NOAA's standards for hydrographic surveys. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that if the nautical chart had been based on a survey conducted in compliance with NOAA guidelines, it would have been more accurate because those guidelines require measurements on tighter sounding intervals and line spacing than those called for by the Army Corps guidelines. According to the plaintiffs, the Army Corps should have followed the NOAA requirements in conducting its initial survey because it knew that NOAA would rely on the survey in creating nautical charts. NOAA did in fact use the Army Corps survey, in conjunction with other sources, to create the chart. Thus, plaintiffs allege two grounds of liability: (1) the Army Corps decision to follow its own guidelines rather than the NOAA guidelines in conducting the survey; and (2) NOAA's decision to create a chart based on that survey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs urge us to hold that the United States has completely waived sovereign immunity in the SAA, and consequently that no discretionary function exception exists in this context. In the event we find that there is such an exception, plaintiffs argue that the exception should not apply to the decisions made by the Army Corps and NOAA, and that the United States should be subject to suit, because the decisions were non-discretionary. The final argument offered by plaintiffs is that even if NOAA's decision to rely on the Army Corps survey was a discretionary decision, once that decision was made, the government entity had a duty of care to create the chart accurately. Plaintiffs argue that since mariners regularly rely on such charts for navigation, misrepresentation as to the depth of the harbor is grounds for liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, defendants argue that the actions by both the Army Corps and NOAA are discretionary decisions that fall within the implied discretionary function exception to the SAA. Thus, defendants argue the United States is protected from suit by sovereign immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Existence of the Implied Discretionary Function Exception</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the threshold issue of whether a discretionary function exception should be implied in the context of the SAA. Unless such an exception can be implied, waiver of sovereign immunity by the United States would allow the plaintiffs' suit to proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States, as sovereign, is immune from suit unless it waives its sovereign immunity and consents to be sued. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Thompson,</i> 98 U.S. 486, 489, 25 L.Ed. 194 (1878). Absent express waiver of sovereign immunity, federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over suits against the United States. <i>United States v. Sherwood,</i> 312 U.S. 584, 586, 61 S.Ct. 767, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941). In the SAA, the United States waives its sovereign immunity from suit for maritime torts committed by its agents. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. Appx. &#167; 742; <i>Gercey v. United States,</i> 540 F.2d 536, 539 (1st Cir.1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SAA contains no express exceptions to the waiver of sovereign immunity. In contrast, the Federal Torts Claims Act (\"FTCA\"), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b), which waives sovereign immunity for tort claims against the United States, contains an express exception to shield the \"discretion of the executive or administrator to act according to one's judgment of the best course.\" <i>Dalehite v. United States,</i> 346 U.S. 15, 34, 73 S.Ct. 956, 97 L.Ed. 1427 (1953). This discretionary function exception serves to prevent \"judicial `second-guessing' of legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social, economic, and political policy.\" <i>United States v. S.A. Empresa de Viacao Aerea Rio Grandense (Varig Airlines),</i> 467 U.S. 797, 814, 104 S.Ct. 2755, 81 L.Ed.2d 660 (1984). This Court has held that a similar discretionary function exception is to be implied into the SAA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See Gercey,</i> 540 F.2d at 539.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline plaintiffs' invitation to reconsider our decision in <i>Gercey,</i> and reaffirm the principles set forth therein. Congress did not intend, by passing the SAA, to create a system wherein all administrative decisions concerning maritime matters are second-guessed and subject to judicial review. <i>Gercey,</i> 540 F.2d at 539. Absence of an \"express Congressional directive to the contrary\" will not be read as a green light for federal courts to assume power to review \"all administrative and legislative decisions concerning the public interest in maritime matters.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court did not err in applying well-established law implying a discretionary function exception to the SAA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

As in the FTCA context, the implied discretionary function exception to the SAA \"insulates the Government from liability if the action challenged in the case involves the permissible exercise of policy judgment.\" <i>Berkovitz v. United States,</i> 486 U.S. 531, 537, 108 S.Ct. 1954, 100 L.Ed.2d 531 (1988). Plaintiffs suggest that the actions of the Army Corps and NOAA fail to meet the discretionary function exception's applicability test and that the United States is therefore subject to suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Berkovitz,</i> the Supreme Court set forth a two-part test to determine whether the discretionary function exception bars a suit against the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> 486 U.S. at 535-37, 108 S.Ct. 1954. First, a court must determine if the challenged conduct involves an element of judgment, meaning that \"the action is a matter of choice for the acting employee.\" <i>Id.</i> at 536, 108 S.Ct. 1954. Second, \"a court must determine whether that judgment is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield,\" meaning it involved \"governmental actions and decisions based on considerations of public policy.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>1.

However, if there is no mandatory regulation that requires a particular course of action, then the discretionary function exception can apply. <i>Id.</i> Here, plaintiffs argue that the Army Corps failed to follow mandatory internal procedures requiring its survey of the Boston Harbor to be conducted in accordance with NOAA guidelines. Because they contend that compliance with the NOAA guidelines was mandatory, plaintiffs claim that the discretionary function exception cannot protect the United States from suit. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No mandatory internal procedures or directives required the Army Corps to adhere to the NOAA guidelines in conducting its survey of the Boston Harbor, thus the \"element of judgment\" prong of the <i>Berkovitz</i> test is met. The Army Corps generally follows its own manual when it performs oceanic surveys, and there is no dispute that the Army Corps' <i>Hydrographic Surveying: Engineer Manual</i> (1994) (\"<i>Army Corps Manual</i>\") applies to hydrographic surveys planned and performed by the Army Corps and sets forth the applicable procedures. <i>Army Corps Manual</i> at 1-4 (stating that \"manual establishes standard procedures, minimum accuracy requirements, instrumentation and equipment requirements, and quality control criteria for hydrographic surveys\"). The <i>Army Corps Manual</i> states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This manual is intended to cover only those engineering and construction survey activities which support typical river, harbor, harbor approach channel, or inland waterway projects.... [it] does not cover classical hydrographic surveying functions which are more traditionally associated with the preparation of nautical charts. These procedures are detailed in the [NOAA <i>Hydrographic Manual</i>].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Army Corps Manual</i> at 1-4(b). Here, the parties agreed and the district court found that the Army Corps conducted the Boston Harbor survey as a \"condition survey,\" which is a periodic survey carried out \"to determine the present condition of navigation channels [and] underwater features, but is not a survey in conjunction with the preparation of a nautical chart.\" <i>Army Corps Manual</i> at 2-10. There is no mandatory language in the <i>Army Corps Manual</i> indicating that the Army Corps must follow the NOAA guidelines when carrying out a condition survey, even if it is aware that such a survey may be used by other agencies to prepare nautical charts &#8212; what matters is the purpose of the survey at the time it is conducted by the Army Corps.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Since the purpose of the survey at the time it was conducted was to determine the condition of the harbor rather than to chart its depth, the Army Corps was under no obligation to comply with NOAA guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found that the choice to conduct the condition survey according to the Army Corps guidelines constituted a discretionary choice, we now turn to the second part of the <i>Berkovitz</i> test and consider whether that decision is of the type the discretionary function exception was designed to protect. <i>Berkovitz,</i> 486 U.S. at 537, 108 S.Ct. 1954.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where \"a regulation allows the employee discretion, the very existence of the regulation creates a strong presumption that a discretionary act authorized by the regulation involves consideration of the same policies which led to the promulgation of the regulations.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>United States</i> <i>v. Gaubert,</i> 499 U.S. 315, 324, 111 S.Ct. 1267, 113 L.Ed.2d 335 (1991). Plaintiff bears the burden of rebutting this presumption and demonstrating that the conduct at issue is not policy-based. <i>See Wood v. United States,</i> 290 F.3d 29, 37 (1st Cir.2002). Here, the plaintiffs fail to meet this burden. Indeed the Corps' decision to follow its own less stringent guidelines is most likely a choice aimed to maximize efficient use of resources, and is thus policy-based. <i>See, e.g., Varig Airlines,</i> 467 U.S. at 820, 104 S.Ct. 2755 (recognizing the efficient allocation of agency resources as a policy choice).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>2.

United States,</i> 350 U.S. 61, 76 S.Ct. 122, 100 L.Ed. 48 (1955), the Supreme Court held the United States liable for negligently maintaining a lighthouse built by the Coast Guard. <i>Id.</i> at 69, 76 S.Ct. 122. Mariners relied on the lighthouse for navigation and plaintiff's ship was damaged when it ran aground because the light went out. <i>Id.</i> at 62, 76 S.Ct. 122. The <i>Indian Towing</i> Court indicated that once the Coast Guard exercised its discretion to operate the lighthouse, it was under an obligation to do so with reasonable care. <i>Id.</i> at 68, 76 S.Ct. 122. We find that <i>Indian Towing</i> can be distinguished from the instant case because there the government conceded that the discretionary function exception did not apply. <i>Id.</i> at 64, 76 S.Ct. 122. In this case, however, the government vigorously argues, and we agree, that the decision by NOAA to use the Corps' data to create the chart was discretionary and was thus the type of decision the discretionary function exception was meant to protect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"element of judgment\" prong of the <i>Berkovitz</i> test is satisfied because NOAA's decision to use the Army Corps survey in fact contains an element of judgment. As stated above, the discretionary function applies unless a \"federal statute, regulation or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow.\" <i>Berkovitz,</i> 486 U.S. at 537, 108 S.Ct. 1954; <i>accord Wood,</i> 290 F.3d at 36. Nowhere in NOAA's <i>Hydrographic Manual</i> are employees directed to use as the basis for charts only surveys conducted by NOAA or by other entities following NOAA's guidelines. In fact, the manual only stipulates that if NOAA itself conducts a survey, it must conform with the manual's specific directives. Here, NOAA did not conduct the 1990 survey of the Boston Harbor which formed the basis for the chart. Since there is no specific regulation, and thus no mandatory language either (1) directing the cartographer as to the surveys that ought to be used when making a chart, or (2) prohibiting use of non-NOAA conforming surveys in creation of a chart, it was within the cartographer's discretion to use the survey made by the Army Corps. <i>See Baird v. United States,</i> 653 F.2d 437, 441 (10th Cir.1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs cite <i>In re Glacier Bay,</i> 71 F.3d 1447 (9th Cir.1995) in support of their argument that the discretionary function does not apply here because NOAA did not follow mandatory procedures regarding hydrographic surveys. <i>Glacier Bay</i> involved the grounding of a vessel on a rock that was omitted from the nautical chart. <i>Id.</i> at 1449-50. In that case, the Ninth Circuit allowed a negligence suit against the government to proceed because NOAA did not comply with its internal guidelines in conducting the survey for the chart. <i>See id.</i> at 1453 (holding that the \"general grant of discretion was superseded by mandatory requirements\" and thus \"the discretionary exception function [sic] does not apply\"). The <i>Glacier Bay</i> case dealt with surveys conducted by NOAA hydrographers for the purpose of preparing nautical charts. <i>Id.</i> at 1450. <i>Glacier Bay</i> is inapposite, however, because this case deals with NOAA's decision to use an Army Corps condition survey for the preparation of a chart rather than with NOAA's failure to follow its own procedures in conducting an independent hydrographic survey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second requirement of the <i>Berkovitz</i> test, that the judgment is the type the discretionary function was designed to protect, is also satisfied with respect to NOAA's decision. The allocation of resources for the production and dissemination of ocean charts by a budget-constrained entity like NOAA is a policy decision that falls within the ambit of the discretionary function exception. Allocation of resources and budget management involve prioritizing and are quintessentially policy-based choices. <i>See Varig Airlines,</i> 467 U.S. at 820, 104 S.Ct. 2755; <i>Weissich v. United States,</i> 4 F.3d 810, 813 (9th Cir.1993) (finding budget and personnel allocation decisions fall within discretionary function exception); <i>Chute v. United States,</i> 610 F.2d 7, 12 (1st Cir.1979) (indicating the allocation of resources among competing priorities is a policy function). If this Court were to agree with plaintiffs, we would be second-guessing NOAA's policy decision and would be going against the clear intent of the implied discretionary function exception, which is \"to prevent judicial second-guessing of legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social, economic, and political policy.\" <i>Berkovitz,</i> 486 U.S. at 536-37, 108 S.Ct. 1954 (quoting <i>Varig Airlines,</i> 467 U.S. at 814, 104 S.Ct. 2755).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because NOAA's decision to rely on the Army Corps' survey for the creation of its chart was a policy-based discretionary decision, the discretionary function exception applies. Given the applicability of the discretionary function exception to both the Army Corps and NOAA decisions, we find that the United States has not waived sovereign immunity and cannot be subjected to suit in this matter. <i>See Wood,</i> 290 F.3d at 33-34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the decision to use the Corps' survey is not protected by the discretionary function exception, we find that no liability attaches here. <i>Indian Towing</i> does not stand for the proposition that once the United States undertakes a function, such as production of a nautical chart, \"the most effective and best means must always be selected.\" <i>Chute,</i> 610 F.2d at 13. Instead, the general principle gleaned from <i>Indian Towing</i> is that \"the government must not mislead, and must not induce reliance upon a belief that it is providing something which, in fact, it is not providing.\" <i>United States v. Sandra &amp; Dennis Fishing Corp.,</i> 372 F.2d 189, 195 (1st Cir.1967).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government cannot be held liable under the principles established by <i>Indian Towing,</i> because (1) it is unreasonable for mariners to rely solely on the chart; and (2) in the alternative, the government did not create the danger in the Boston Harbor. In order for <i>Indian Towing</i> to apply, the chart would need to induce reasonable reliance on the part of mariners. <i>See Whitney Steamship Co. v. United States,</i> 747 F.2d 69, 78 (2d Cir.1984) (Tenney, J., dissenting) (arguing that <i>Indian Towing</i> applies only where reliance is reasonable). Given the constant possibility that silting or other events may alter the depth of the harbor at any given point, reliance on a year-old chart was unreasonable. Further, the state law requirement that foreign vessels employ a special harbor pilot in the Boston Harbor suggests that at least the Massachusetts legislature believed that reliance on the accuracy of a chart is unreasonable. Were such reliance reasonable, then nautical charts alone would be sufficient for navigation, and presumably a mariner inexperienced with the Boston Harbor would be able to maneuver a vessel safely through its waters by simply using a chart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if there were no statutory requirement for an experienced harbor pilot, the prudent mariner does not rely on charts alone when navigating a body of water. <i>See, e.g., Sheridan Transp. Co. v. United States,</i> 897 F.2d 795, 798 (5th Cir.1990) (\"aids to navigation do not exist in a vacuum and there are various documents which a mariner must use to determine whether he is justified in relying on an aid\"); <i>Tidewater Marine, Inc. v. Sanco Int'l, Inc.,</i> 113 F.Supp.2d 987, 997 (E.D.La. 2000) (\"Buoys, radar, Loran, charts, Notices to Mariners, and lookouts are all aids to navigation. None of these alone can be considered absolute indicators of sea conditions.\"). Here, the chart itself contained prominent warnings that mariners should look to other sources for up-to-date information about the harbor. Because a mariner cannot reasonably rely solely on a chart, nautical charts do not induce reliance such that the government has a duty to ensure their accuracy, especially where the government specifically directs mariners to other publications through warnings or cautions on the chart itself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the government does not create a danger but rather only fails to \"render adequate performance,\" liability does not attach. <i>Brown v. United States,</i> 790 F.2d 199 (1st Cir.1986) (distinguishing <i>Indian Towing,</i> where \"the government created a danger by representing that an operating lighthouse was present\" from cases where the government does not itself create the danger, as in the case where the government issues weather advisories but does not control the weather). Here, the government did not create the dangers of the Boston Harbor, but merely undertook to produce a chart depicting the depths of the harbor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

Plaintiffs point to <i>Lane v. United States,</i> 529 F.2d 175 (4th Cir.1975), in support of their argument that the discretionary function exception does not apply in the SAA context.

These charts are published by the Government with the certain knowledge that they (i) will be disseminated through reliable channels to ships and crews and (ii) will be relied on as accurate portrayals of the waters covered. Indeed, this expectation is mandated as a rule of prudent conduct on the part of shipowners. Sailing without a chart or with an obsolete one ranks as more than a mere indiscretion. Many Courts have found such ships to be unseaworthy.

We believe an adequate warning, such as a Notice to Mariners, regarding possible inaccuracies in a chart \"may absolve the [government] of liability\" because \"the navigator would no longer be entitled to rely on the [navigational] aid.\" <i>Whitney Steamship,</i> 747 F.2d, at 78 (Tenney, J., dissenting).

Plaintiffs claim that the erroneous chart resulted in the grounding of and subsequent damage to their vessel, the <i>M/T Limar.</i> Plaintiffs raise two main issues on appeal, namely, that the district court erred in: (1) finding that there is an implied discretionary function exemption in the Suits in Admiralty Act; and (2) applying the discretionary function exemption as it did to the facts of this case. After careful review, we affirm the district court's ruling for the reasons stated below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of March 11, 1996, the steel hulled tanker vessel <i>M/T Limar,</i> owned by Limar and operated by OMI, approached Boston, Massachusetts. Under Massachusetts law, foreign vessels the size of the <i>M/T Limar</i> must employ a harbor pilot when entering Boston Harbor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 103, &#167;&#167; 21, 28. Accordingly, the <i>M/T Limar</i> took aboard a harbor pilot, Lawrence Cannon, who undertook navigation of the ship through the Boston Harbor shipping channel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main shipping route in the Boston Harbor includes side-by-side inbound and outbound channels, which are maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers (\"Army Corps\"). Congress allocates funds to maintain federal shipping channels at certain authorized depths and widths. In 1996, the Army Corps was authorized to dredge the Boston Harbor inbound channel to a depth of thirty-five feet below Mean Low Water, and was also authorized to maintain the outbound channel at a depth of not more than forty feet. Both of these channels could be maintained up to 600 feet wide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Army Corps conducts periodic surveys of the shipping channels to determine their actual depths, as opposed to the authorized depths, and to discover any unexpected debris or shoaling. The results of these surveys are made known to the public through <i>Results of Survey Reports</i> and the Coast Guard's <i>Local Notice to Mariners</i> publications. Relevant to this matter, the last periodic survey of the disputed area of the inbound channel was completed in 1990. The results of the 1990 Boston Harbor survey appeared in a <i>Results of Survey Report</i> dated July 23, 1990, and they were published in the First Coast Guard District's <i>Local Notice to Mariners,</i> Number 31, on August 1, 1990. They also appeared in a book entitled <i>The Port of Boston, Massachusetts, Port Series No. 3,</i> issued in 1994. In each of these sources, the 1990 survey reported the controlling depth of the channel, which is the shallowest point at any place as compared to Mean Low Water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cannon, a harbor pilot with twenty-four years of experience at the time of the grounding, knew these survey results, and did not bring a nautical chart with him. Although he had never been aboard the <i>M/T Limar,</i> he familiarized himself with the ship, and asked the <i>M/T Limar's</i> crew for the draft of the ship before directing the ship through Boston Harbor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Cannon piloted the vessel, the <i>M/T Limar's</i> crew observed the movement of the ship. Third Mate Rodolfo Arcilla took periodic position fixes of the vessel's location and plotted them on the <i>M/T Limar's copy</i> of Nautical Chart 13272, 43d Edition, dated June 28, 1995. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (\"NOAA\") created this chart using information from several sources, including the 1990 Army Corps survey mentioned above.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 8:50 a.m., the <i>M/T Limar</i> scraped the Boston Harbor floor near Red Nunn Buoy No. 8, at approximately 42 20.494' N and 71 00.505' W. According to the nautical chart produced by NOAA, the water depths nearest to the position of the groundings are thirty-five and thirty-six feet, which allegedly should have accommodated the <i>M/T Limar's</i> thirty-three feet, nine inch draft. The vessel grounded on the starboard (right) side forebody, but was still able to reach its berth. However, the damage to the hull and the ensuing steps taken to prevent oil pollution are alleged to have cost Limar and OMI in excess of $800,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Limar and OMI sued the government under the Suits in Admiralty Act (\"SAA\"), 46 U.S.C. Appx. &#167;&#167; 741-52 (1976), alleging that the misrepresentation of the water depth on the chart caused the damage to the <i>M/T Limar.</i> The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the United States, finding that the discretionary function exception applied and that the United States was entitled to dismissal of the complaint on grounds of sovereign immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court reviews the grant of a summary judgment motion de novo, considering all facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, in this case the plaintiffs. <i>Gu v. Boston Police Dept., et al.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200231\"><a href=\"/opinion/200231/gu-v-boston-police-dept/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involves allegations of negligence on the part of the United States in the production and dissemination of a nautical chart. In order to avoid confusion, we highlight several key facts. The Army Corps conducted a survey of the Boston Harbor, which was later used by NOAA to create a nautical chart of the harbor. The plaintiffs argue that the chart failed to accurately depict the depth of the harbor, and the <i>M/T Limar's</i> grounding was a result of this inaccuracy. Instead of following what the plaintiffs allege are mandatory standards, the Army Corps followed its own guidelines in conducting the survey. The plaintiffs contend that the chart's inaccuracy could have been prevented if NOAA had based the chart on a survey that was conducted in accordance with NOAA's standards for hydrographic surveys. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that if the nautical chart had been based on a survey conducted in compliance with NOAA guidelines, it would have been more accurate because those guidelines require measurements on tighter sounding intervals and line spacing than those called for by the Army Corps guidelines. According to the plaintiffs, the Army Corps should have followed the NOAA requirements in conducting its initial survey because it knew that NOAA would rely on the survey in creating nautical charts. NOAA did in fact use the Army Corps survey, in conjunction with other sources, to create the chart. Thus, plaintiffs allege two grounds of liability: (1) the Army Corps decision to follow its own guidelines rather than the NOAA guidelines in conducting the survey; and (2) NOAA's decision to create a chart based on that survey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs urge us to hold that the United States has completely waived sovereign immunity in the SAA, and consequently that no discretionary function exception exists in this context. In the event we find that there is such an exception, plaintiffs argue that the exception should not apply to the decisions made by the Army Corps and NOAA, and that the United States should be subject to suit, because the decisions were non-discretionary. The final argument offered by plaintiffs is that even if NOAA's decision to rely on the Army Corps survey was a discretionary decision, once that decision was made, the government entity had a duty of care to create the chart accurately. Plaintiffs argue that since mariners regularly rely on such charts for navigation, misrepresentation as to the depth of the harbor is grounds for liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, defendants argue that the actions by both the Army Corps and NOAA are discretionary decisions that fall within the implied discretionary function exception to the SAA. Thus, defendants argue the United States is protected from suit by sovereign immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Existence of the Implied Discretionary Function Exception</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the threshold issue of whether a discretionary function exception should be implied in the context of the SAA. Unless such an exception can be implied, waiver of sovereign immunity by the United States would allow the plaintiffs' suit to proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States, as sovereign, is immune from suit unless it waives its sovereign immunity and consents to be sued. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

In contrast, the Federal Torts Claims Act (\"FTCA\"), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b), which waives sovereign immunity for tort claims against the United States, contains an express exception to shield the \"discretion of the executive or administrator to act according to one's judgment of the best course.\" <i>Dalehite v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span> (1984). This Court has held that a similar discretionary function exception is to be implied into the SAA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See Gercey,</i> 540 F.2d at 539.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline plaintiffs' invitation to reconsider our decision in <i>Gercey,</i> and reaffirm the principles set forth therein. Congress did not intend, by passing the SAA, to create a system wherein all administrative decisions concerning maritime matters are second-guessed and subject to judicial review. <i>Gercey,</i> 540 F.2d at 539. Absence of an \"express Congressional directive to the contrary\" will not be read as a green light for federal courts to assume power to review \"all administrative and legislative decisions concerning the public interest in maritime matters.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court did not err in applying well-established law implying a discretionary function exception to the SAA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

Plaintiffs suggest that the actions of the Army Corps and NOAA fail to meet the discretionary function exception's applicability test and that the United States is therefore subject to suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Berkovitz,</i> the Supreme Court set forth a two-part test to determine whether the discretionary function exception bars a suit against the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> 486 U.S. at 535-37, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112093\"><a href=\"/opinion/112093/berkovitz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1954</span></a></span>. However, if there is no mandatory regulation that requires a particular course of action, then the discretionary function exception can apply. <i>Id.</i> Here, plaintiffs argue that the Army Corps failed to follow mandatory internal procedures requiring its survey of the Boston Harbor to be conducted in accordance with NOAA guidelines. Because they contend that compliance with the NOAA guidelines was mandatory, plaintiffs claim that the discretionary function exception cannot protect the United States from suit. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No mandatory internal procedures or directives required the Army Corps to adhere to the NOAA guidelines in conducting its survey of the Boston Harbor, thus the \"element of judgment\" prong of the <i>Berkovitz</i> test is met. The Army Corps generally follows its own manual when it performs oceanic surveys, and there is no dispute that the Army Corps' <i>Hydrographic Surveying: Engineer Manual</i> (1994) (\"<i>Army Corps Manual</i>\") applies to hydrographic surveys planned and performed by the Army Corps and sets forth the applicable procedures. <i>Army Corps Manual</i> at 1-4 (stating that \"manual establishes standard procedures, minimum accuracy requirements, instrumentation and equipment requirements, and quality control criteria for hydrographic surveys\"). The <i>Army Corps Manual</i> states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This manual is intended to cover only those engineering and construction survey activities which support typical river, harbor, harbor approach channel, or inland waterway projects....

Here, the parties agreed and the district court found that the Army Corps conducted the Boston Harbor survey as a \"condition survey,\" which is a periodic survey carried out \"to determine the present condition of navigation channels [and] underwater features, but is not a survey in conjunction with the preparation of a nautical chart.\" <i>Army Corps Manual</i> at 2-10. There is no mandatory language in the <i>Army Corps Manual</i> indicating that the Army Corps must follow the NOAA guidelines when carrying out a condition survey, even if it is aware that such a survey may be used by other agencies to prepare nautical charts &#8212; what matters is the purpose of the survey at the time it is conducted by the Army Corps.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Since the purpose of the survey at the time it was conducted was to determine the condition of the harbor rather than to chart its depth, the Army Corps was under no obligation to comply with NOAA guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found that the choice to conduct the condition survey according to the Army Corps guidelines constituted a discretionary choice, we now turn to the second part of the <i>Berkovitz</i> test and consider whether that decision is of the type the discretionary function exception was designed to protect. <i>Berkovitz,</i> 486 U.S. at 537, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112093\"><a href=\"/opinion/112093/berkovitz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nowhere in NOAA's <i>Hydrographic Manual</i> are employees directed to use as the basis for charts only surveys conducted by NOAA or by other entities following NOAA's guidelines. In fact, the manual only stipulates that if NOAA itself conducts a survey, it must conform with the manual's specific directives. Here, NOAA did not conduct the 1990 survey of the Boston Harbor which formed the basis for the chart. Since there is no specific regulation, and thus no mandatory language either (1) directing the cartographer as to the surveys that ought to be used when making a chart, or (2) prohibiting use of non-NOAA conforming surveys in creation of a chart, it was within the cartographer's discretion to use the survey made by the Army Corps. <i>See Baird v.

The <i>Glacier Bay</i> case dealt with surveys conducted by NOAA hydrographers for the purpose of preparing nautical charts. <i>Id.</i> at 1450. <i>Glacier Bay</i> is inapposite, however, because this case deals with NOAA's decision to use an Army Corps condition survey for the preparation of a chart rather than with NOAA's failure to follow its own procedures in conducting an independent hydrographic survey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second requirement of the <i>Berkovitz</i> test, that the judgment is the type the discretionary function was designed to protect, is also satisfied with respect to NOAA's decision.

Given the constant possibility that silting or other events may alter the depth of the harbor at any given point, reliance on a year-old chart was unreasonable. Further, the state law requirement that foreign vessels employ a special harbor pilot in the Boston Harbor suggests that at least the Massachusetts legislature believed that reliance on the accuracy of a chart is unreasonable. Were such reliance reasonable, then nautical charts alone would be sufficient for navigation, and presumably a mariner inexperienced with the Boston Harbor would be able to maneuver a vessel safely through its waters by simply using a chart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if there were no statutory requirement for an experienced harbor pilot, the prudent mariner does not rely on charts alone when navigating a body of water. <i>See, e.g., Sheridan Transp.

None of these alone can be considered absolute indicators of sea conditions.\"). Here, the chart itself contained prominent warnings that mariners should look to other sources for up-to-date information about the harbor. Because a mariner cannot reasonably rely solely on a chart, nautical charts do not induce reliance such that the government has a duty to ensure their accuracy, especially where the government specifically directs mariners to other publications through warnings or cautions on the chart itself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the government does not create a danger but rather only fails to \"render adequate performance,\" liability does not attach. <i>Brown v.

Indeed, this expectation is mandated as a rule of prudent conduct on the part of shipowners. Sailing without a chart or with an obsolete one ranks as more than a mere indiscretion.
