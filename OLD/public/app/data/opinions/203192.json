Pietrantoni, with whom Casellas Alcover & Burgos,\nP.S.C. was on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n                         March 18, 2008\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge.         In this tort and breach of\n\ncontract suit, Marilyn González-Toro (\"González\") and the Conjugal\n\nPartnership Aguirre-González (together, \"appellants\") failed to\n\nchallenge plaintiffs' statement of material facts in support of a\n\nmotion for summary judgment.         Because the appellants did not\n\ncounter the statement of material facts, the district court deemed\n\nthe facts admitted, granted summary judgment, and imposed joint and\n\nseveral liability on the appellants for fraudulent acts committed\n\nby Alvin Aguirre-González (\"Aguirre\") and several corporations. We\n\napprove of the district court's decision to deem the uncontested\n\nfacts admitted under Local Rule 56(e), and against that backdrop we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                 1. Facts\n\n           On review of a motion for summary judgment, we take the\n\nfacts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, in this\n\ncase the appellants.       Cash v. Cycle Craft Co., 508 F.3d 680, 682\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).    We likewise draw whatever reasonable inferences\n\nfavor the non-moving party.        Id.        In this case, the familiar\n\nstandard is qualified somewhat because the district court deemed\n\nadmitted the facts contained in the movant's statement of material\n\nfacts.    We analyze that decision below, and as we find it within\n\nthe   district   court's    discretion   we    will   not   upset   it    here.\n\nConsequently, we review the facts as set out in the statement of\n\nmaterial facts accompanying the summary judgment motion.                 To the\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fextent that other facts might cast doubt on them, those other facts\n\nare disregarded. This is because, on appeal from summary judgment,\n\nwe consider the same record that was before the district court.\n\nTorres-Rosado v. Rotger-Sabat, 335 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           The    plaintiffs   are    various     companies,    trustees,    and\n\nindividuals   who    filed   suit    against     Aguirre,    González,     their\n\nconjugal   partnership,      and    several    corporations     controlled    by\n\nAguirre.   The suit alleged fraud, breach of contract, and various\n\ntortious violations of the Puerto Rico civil code.                González and\n\nAguirre were married throughout conduct complained of and when the\n\ncomplaint was filed -- the pair divorced only after the plaintiffs\n\nfiled suit.       Their conjugal legal partnership has never been\n\nsettled.   According to the complaint, Aguirre and other defendants\n\ncommitted torts regarding leases they held with various municipal\n\nand government entities in Puerto Rico.               Some examples provide\n\nenough of the flavor of the complaint.           The complaint alleged that\n\nAguirre had assigned to more than one party, for value, the right\n\nto receive the same payments from some leases.                    And Aguirre\n\nallegedly concealed that some leases were in default and would\n\nlikely remain in default, thereby selling the right to receive\n\npayments   that     would    never    come.       Aguirre      also    allegedly\n\nmisrepresented      the   amounts    due      under   some   leases,     leading\n\npurchasers to pay more than they could ever receive.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f             González       was    a     director,        officer,    incorporator,      or\n\nresident agent for all of the defendant corporations.                            She signed\n\nchecks on their behalf and drew a monthly salary from one.                           After\n\nthe divorce, González continued to derive all her support from her\n\nhusband,     taking   cash        advances       on   a   credit     card   he    paid   and\n\nreceiving wire transfers totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars\n\nfrom corporations he controlled.                  She understood this money to be\n\nan advance on the settlement of their conjugal legal partnership.\n\n             Aguirre never answered the complaint; he had decamped to\n\nthe Dominican Republic, or perhaps Panama.1                           Neither did the\n\ndefendant corporations answer. González answered on her own behalf\n\nand for the conjugal legal partnership.\n\n             The district court issued an attachment order against\n\nthose   defendants      who       had     not    answered      the    complaint.         The\n\nappellants were directed to show cause why the order should not\n\napply   to    them,     and       they     did    so      to   the    district      court's\n\nsatisfaction.         The     district       court        declared    Aguirre      and   the\n\ndefendant corporations (the \"other defendants\") in default and\n\nissued partial judgment against them.\n\n\n\n\n1\n Alvin Aguirre-González has since been arrested and pled guilty to\n18 counts of mail fraud. During the pendency of this appeal he was\nsentenced to 57 months' imprisonment, forfeiture of one and a half\nmillion dollars, and restitution of nearly five million dollars.\nSee United States v. Aguirre-González, 3:05-cr-00387-PG (D.P.R.).\nAn appeal is pending.\n\n                                            -5-\n\f            The   plaintiffs      moved   to    expand       the    scope    of    the\n\nattachment   order    so   that    it   would    apply   to        the   appellants.\n\nGonzález testified at a hearing on the motion and was cross-\n\nexamined by her own counsel.            On the basis of that hearing and\n\nevidence received into the record, the district court expanded the\n\nattachment order as requested.\n\n            The plaintiffs then moved for summary judgment against\n\nthe appellants, citing the facts adduced at the attachment hearing.\n\nThe plaintiffs, in conformance with Local Rule 56(b), submitted a\n\nstatement of material facts to support their motion for summary\n\njudgment.    The appellants submitted an opposition to the summary\n\njudgment motion, but failed to include an opposing statement of\n\nmaterial facts as required by Local Rule 56(c). The district court\n\nnoted the procedural failure, deemed the facts in the plaintiffs'\n\nstatement to be admitted by the appellants, and on the basis of\n\nthose facts granted summary judgment against the appellants.\n\n                               2. Discussion\n\n            The appellants claimed in their opposition to summary\n\njudgment, and claim again on appeal, that there is a genuine\n\ndispute   about   a   material    fact.        But   given    their      failure    to\n\nchallenge the plaintiffs' facts, in reality their argument is that\n\nthe plaintiffs have failed to prove that they are entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.        Neither formulation of the argument\n\navails.\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f          a.     The Anti-Ferret Rule\n\n          District of Puerto Rico Local Rule 56(c) is clear about\n\nthe obligation of a party opposing summary judgment:\n\n          A party opposing a motion for summary judgment\n          shall submit with its opposition a separate,\n          short, and concise statement of material facts.\n          The opposing statement shall admit, deny or\n          qualify the facts by reference to each numbered\n          paragraph of the moving party’s statement of\n          material facts and unless a fact is admitted,\n          shall support each denial or qualification by\n          a record citation as required by this rule.\n\nLocal Rule 56(c).   Rule 56(e) sets forth in mandatory terms the\n\nresult of failure to follow Rule 56(c):      \"Facts contained in a\n\nsupporting or opposing statement of material facts, if supported by\n\nrecord citations as required by this rule, shall be deemed admitted\n\nunless properly controverted.\"   Local Rule 56(e) (emphasis added).\n\n          The purpose of this rule is to relieve the district court\n\nof any responsibility to ferret through the record to discern\n\nwhether any material fact is genuinely in dispute.2   We have upheld\n\nthe application of the rule.     Mariani-Colon v. Dep't of Homeland\n\nSec., 511 F.3d 216, 219 (1st Cir. 2007).     We review the \"deeming\n\norder\" for an abuse of discretion. Hernandez v. Philip Morris USA,\n\nInc., 486 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n\n\n\n2\n The deeming order is both a sanction for the parties and a balm\nfor the district court:   the parties are given an incentive to\nconform to the rule (provided they wish to have their version of\nthe facts considered), and the district court is in any case\nrelieved of the obligation to ferret through the record.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f            Here,       the    appellants      failed    to   submit     a    separate\n\nstatement of material facts.                Nor did they anywhere in their\n\nopposition undertake to \"admit, deny or qualify the facts by\n\nreference    to    each       numbered   paragraph      of    the    moving     party's\n\nstatement of material facts.\"               The appellants did include five\n\nfacts in their opposition to the motion, but those facts are not\n\nexplicitly directed at qualifying or contradicting specific facts\n\nin   the   plaintiffs'        statement,    nor   are     they      presented    in   an\n\n\"opposing statement\" \"separate\"             from the opposition itself.3              The\n\nlanguage    of    the    rule    is   plain,    and     the   appellants'       conduct\n\nobviously falls within its scope. The district court therefore was\n\nwithin its discretion to deem the facts in the statement of\n\nmaterial facts admitted.\n\n            When summary judgment is granted after a deeming order,\n\nwe are bound by the order as well, provided it was not an abuse of\n\nthe district court's discretion.               If it were otherwise, then the\n\ntask of sifting through the record for genuine issues of material\n\nfact would merely have been transferred from the district court, at\n\n\n3\n We have previously held that failure to set forth a paragraph-by-\nparagraph admission or denial of the movant's material facts\njustifies a deeming order even where the opposition does propound\nother facts. See Hernandez, 486 F.3d at 7. Hernandez leaves open\nthe possibility that facts marshaled in opposition might be\naccepted to \"augment\" the facts contained in movant's statement of\nmaterial facts, rather than contradict them. Id. at n.2. Without\ndeciding the issue of whether the district court could have\nexcluded these facts entirely, we proceed to evaluate the record as\nthough those facts were accepted to augment the movant's facts; as\nwe shall see, they do not change the result.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fsummary judgment, to the appellate court, on appeal of that summary\n\njudgment.    The anti-ferret rule would thus be rendered toothless.\n\n            The    appellants     do   not    contest   the    district   court's\n\ndeeming order.      Nor do they seek to controvert any of the facts in\n\nplaintiffs' statement.         Rather, they claim that the facts therein\n\nand in the remainder of the record are insufficient as a matter of\n\nlaw to hold them liable for Aguirre's actions. Although they couch\n\nthe issue in terms of genuine issues of material fact, their real\n\narguments are these:          first, that the conjugal legal partnership\n\nshould   not      have    liability    imposed    on    it    because   there   is\n\ninsufficient evidence in the record that it received the benefit of\n\nAguirre's actions; and second, that the plaintiffs have failed to\n\nintroduce evidence establishing that González is liable under\n\nPuerto Rico law for her husband's commission of these torts.                    We\n\nexamine each in turn.\n\n            b.           The Conjugal Legal Partnership\n\n            Under Puerto Rico law, the conjugal legal partnership can\n\nbe held responsible for torts committed by one spouse as long as\n\nthe action that gave rise to the tort was for the benefit of the\n\nconjugal legal partnership.            \"The generally acknowledged rule is\n\nthat if the member's work is profitable for the community the\n\nliability will also fall on said community's property.\" Asociacion\n\nDe Proprietarios Del Condominio Villas De Playa I De Dorado Del\n\nMar, Inc. v. Santa Bárbara Company of Puerto Rico, Inc., 12 P.R.\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fOffic. Trans. 41 (1982).      This has been the rule in Puerto Rico\n\nsince     Lugo-Montalvo v. González-Manon, 4 P.R. Offic. Trans. 517\n\n(1975).     In that case, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court held the\n\nconjugal legal partnership shared the husband's potential liability\n\nin a malpractice action.     The court reasoned:\n\n            While [the husband] is married, everything he\n            earns exercising his profession goes to the\n            community property.    In the course of his\n            professional practice he may incur civil\n            liability for malpractice. Should he be the\n            only one liable with his separate property, or\n            should he have the backing of the community\n            for which he works? . . . [H]is professional\n            economical endeavor benefits the bulk of the\n            community property and the latter should also\n            be liable when the obligation arises.\n\nId. at 525-26.    So it is here.    Alvin Aguirre earned money from his\n\nbusiness    activities,   money    that   went   to   the   conjugal   legal\n\npartnership.     His business activities included the fraudulent\n\ntransactions at issue.     Therefore the conjugal legal partnership,\n\nwhich has yet to be settled, is liable. The appellants' contention\n\nthat Aguirre was acting on behalf of the defendant corporations and\n\ntherefore not for the benefit of the conjugal legal partnership is\n\nan argument that was squarely rejected by the Puerto Rico Supreme\n\nCourt twenty-five years ago.       \"[R]espondents' argument that since\n\nit was not the marital community that directly received the income\n\nof engineer Ariel Gutiérrez, but rather another artificial person\n\nwho received it--Sociedad E.H.G. Arquitectos e Ingenieros--it is\n\nexempted from liability, fails to convince us.\"              Asociacion De\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fProprietarios Del Condominio Villas De Playa I De Dorado Del Mar,\n\nInc., 12 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 61.\n\n          This provides a basis for the liability of the conjugal\n\nlegal partnership even if González herself were not liable for the\n\nactions of her husband.    But, as we establish below, the district\n\ncourt was right to hold her liable as well.\n\n          c.      Marilyn González-Toro\n\n          The   district   court   also   found    González   jointly   and\n\nseverally liable for the acts of her husband.         The district court\n\nbased summary judgment on Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil\n\nCode.   \"A person, who by an act or omission causes damage to\n\nanother through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the\n\ndamage done.\"   Id.   The district court determined that González\n\nnegligently assisted the fraud.       We instead affirm the judgment\n\nbecause the evidence supports a finding of \"fault.\"             The terms\n\n\"fault\" and \"negligence\" used here have specific meanings in the\n\ncivil code context of Puerto Rico law.            \"Fault consists in the\n\nfailure to exercise due diligence, the use of which would have\n\nprevented the wrongful result. Due diligence is that which one can\n\nexpect from the average human being, the good paterfamilias.\"\n\nJimenez v. Pelegrina Espinet, 12 P.R. Offic. Trans. 881, 886\n\n(1982); see also Gierbolini v. Employers Fire Ins. Co., 4 P.R.\n\nOffic. Trans. 1197, 1201-02 (1976) (\"[F]ault requires the execution\n\nof a positive act causing a damage to another person different from\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fthe one who executed it, and, in turn, negligence supposes an\n\nomission producing the same effect, although both have in common\n\nthat the act be executed or the omission incurred without an\n\ninjurious intent.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) (citation\n\nomitted)).       Further, it is an oft-cited precept of Puerto Rico law\n\nthat \"the concept of fault 'is as broad as the behavior of human\n\nbeings,    and    that   it   includes   any   fault   that   causes   harm   or\n\ninjury.'\"        Bonilla v. Chardon, 18 P.R. Offic. Trans. 696, 709\n\n(1987) (quoting Colón v. Romero Barceló, 112 D.P.R. 573, 579\n\n(1982)).\n\n            In granting summary judgment, the district court pointed\n\nto González's behavior both during the frauds and afterwards.\n\nDuring the frauds, González was a director, officer, incorporator,\n\nor resident agent for all of the defendant corporations. After the\n\ndivorce, when she knew Aguirre was subject to an attachment order\n\nand was being investigated for possible criminal charges, she\n\ncontinued to receive money from him.\n\n            On appeal, González argues that the funds she received\n\ncame from corporations other than the defendant corporations, and\n\nthat she cannot be subject to a judgment of negligence because she\n\nowed no duty to the plaintiffs.          Considered in the context of the\n\nstatement of uncontested material facts, neither contention avails\n\nher.   The fact that the funds came from different corporations is\n\nirrelevant.       The statement of uncontested material facts cited to\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fGonzález's own statements in the record that all or nearly all the\n\nmoney she received came from Aguirre. In the opposition to summary\n\njudgment, the appellants did set forth that the funds came from\n\nother corporations.   But because appellants failed to satisfy the\n\nanti-ferret rule, we accept those facts only to the extent that\n\nthey do not contradict the facts deemed admitted by the district\n\ncourt.4\n\n          Here, the two sets of facts are easy to harmonize.\n\nGonzález was not lying under oath when she said at the attachment\n\nhearing that her ex-husband had given her the money; and it is\n\ncorrect to say that the wire transfers came from corporations that\n\nwere not defendants in this case.   Even viewing these facts in the\n\nlight most favorable to the appellants, the record is clear that\n\nAguirre was using these other corporations to disburse funds to\n\nGonzález, funds she knew or should have known were subject to the\n\nattachment order.\n\n          The appellants spend considerable time in their brief\n\nmaking this out to be a case of piercing the corporate veil.   But\n\n\n\n4\n We repeat that because the opposition to summary judgment did not\ninclude an \"Opposing Statement of Material Facts\" as required by\nLocal Rule 56(c), the district court would likely have been free to\ndisregard the facts in the opposition itself. We do not decide\nthat question because it is not presented to us. In this case the\ndistrict court did not explicitly reject the facts, nor did it\nexplicitly consider them. It makes no difference whether these\nopposing facts are considered because they can easily be harmonized\nwith the view of the evidence propounded in the statement of\nuncontested material facts.\n\n                               -13-\n\fit is not.       Rather, this is a case where the established facts\n\npoint to a person aiding her spouse by participating in the\n\ncreation and administration of corporations used to defraud, and\n\nthen aiding him again by receiving funds from him even though she\n\nknew he was under an attachment order and being sued to recover the\n\nmoney those corporations had fraudulently obtained.                Even assuming\n\nthat   González     is    not    liable     for   the   actions    of   defendant\n\ncorporations by virtue of her role in them, she is still liable\n\nbecause she helped her husband carry out these schemes and helped\n\nhim dispose of the money.\n\n            Turning to the appellants' contention that González owed\n\nno duty to the appellees, it is true that the district court did\n\nnot spell out the duty owed.           Nevertheless, summary judgment was\n\nequally proper under the alternative \"fault\" standard in Puerto\n\nRico law.      \"We may affirm a summary judgment decision on any basis\n\napparent in the record.\"           Perry v. Wolaver, 506 F.3d 48, 53 (1st\n\nCir.   2007)    (internal       quotation   marks    omitted)     (quoting   Uncle\n\nHenry's, Inc. v. Plaut Consulting Co., 399 F.3d 33, 41 (1st Cir.\n\n2005)).     Here, the uncontested material facts support summary\n\njudgment    because      no   reasonable     construction    of    them   excuses\n\nGonzález from willfully receiving money from her ex-husband when\n\nshe knew he was subject to an attachment order in this case.\n\nGonzález had actual knowledge of the attachment order because she\n\nhad defended against the same order.                While perhaps her earlier\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\factions, viewed alone, could have been put down to ignorance or a\n\ngood-faith   belief   that   her   husband   had   enlisted   her   aid   in\n\nincorporating and administering these corporations for legitimate\n\nbusiness purposes, such an inference is rendered unreasonable by\n\nher subsequent actions.      The district court properly assessed the\n\nfacts in context and supportably found no contested issue of\n\nmaterial fact to preclude summary judgment.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f",

Because the appellants did not counter the statement of material facts, the district court deemed the facts admitted, granted summary judgment, and imposed joint and several liability on the appellants for fraudulent acts committed by Alvin Aguirre-González (\"Aguirre\") and several corporations. We approve of the district court's decision to deem the uncontested facts admitted under Local Rule 56(e), and against that backdrop we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Facts</h2>\n<p>On review of a motion for summary judgment, we take the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, in this case the appellants. <i>Cash v. Cycle Craft Co.,</i> 508 F.3d 680, 682 (1st Cir.2007). We likewise draw whatever reasonable inferences favor the non-moving party. <i>Id.</i> In this case, the familiar standard is qualified somewhat because the district court deemed admitted the facts contained in the movant's statement of material facts. We analyze that decision below, and as we find it within the district court's discretion we will not upset it here. Consequently, we review the facts as set out in the statement of material facts accompanying the summary judgment motion. To the extent that other facts might cast doubt on them, those other facts are disregarded. This is because, on appeal from summary judgment, we consider the same record that was before the district court. <i>Torres-Rosado v. Rotger-Sabat,</i> 335 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs are various companies, trustees, and individuals who filed suit against Aguirre, González, their conjugal partnership, and several corporations controlled by Aguirre. The suit alleged fraud, breach of contract, and various tortious violations of the Puerto Rico civil code. González and Aguirre were married throughout conduct complained of and when the complaint was filed  the pair divorced only after the plaintiffs filed suit. Their conjugal legal partnership has never been settled. According to the complaint, Aguirre and other defendants committed torts regarding leases they held with various municipal and government entities in Puerto Rico. Some examples provide enough of the flavor of the complaint. The complaint alleged that Aguirre had assigned to more than one party, for value, the right to receive the same payments from some leases. And Aguirre allegedly concealed that some leases were in default and would likely remain in default, thereby selling the right to receive payments that would never come. Aguirre also allegedly misrepresented the amounts due under some leases, leading purchasers to pay more than they could ever receive.</p>\n<p>González was a director, officer, incorporator, or resident agent for all of the defendant corporations. She signed checks on their behalf and drew a monthly salary from one. After the divorce, González continued to derive all her support from her husband, taking cash advances on a credit card he paid and receiving wire transfers totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars from corporations he controlled. She understood this money to be an advance on the settlement of their conjugal legal partnership.</p>\n<p>Aguirre never answered the complaint; he had decamped to the Dominican Republic, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> or perhaps Panama.<sup>[1]</sup> Neither did the defendant corporations answer. González answered on her own behalf and for the conjugal legal partnership.</p>\n<p>The district court issued an attachment order against those defendants who had not answered the complaint. The appellants were directed to show cause why the order should not apply to them, and they did so to the district court's satisfaction. The district court declared Aguirre and the defendant corporations (the \"other defendants\") in default and issued partial judgment against them.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs moved to expand the scope of the attachment order so that it would apply to the appellants. González testified at a hearing on the motion and was cross-examined by her own counsel. On the basis of that hearing and evidence received into the record, the district court expanded the attachment order as requested.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs then moved for summary judgment against the appellants, citing the facts adduced at the attachment hearing. The plaintiffs, in conformance with Local Rule 56(b), submitted a statement of material facts to support their motion for summary judgment. The appellants submitted an opposition to the summary judgment motion, but failed to include an opposing statement of material facts as required by Local Rule 56(c). The district court noted the procedural failure, deemed the facts in the plaintiffs' statement to be admitted by the appellants, and on the basis of those facts granted summary judgment against the appellants.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Discussion</h2>\n<p>The appellants claimed in their opposition to summary judgment, and claim again on appeal, that there is a genuine dispute about a material fact. But given their failure to challenge the plaintiffs' facts, in reality their argument is that the plaintiffs have failed to prove that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Neither formulation of the argument avails.</p>\n<p>a. The Anti-Ferret Rule</p>\n<p>District of Puerto Rico Local Rule 56(c) is clear about the obligation of a party opposing summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote>A party opposing a motion for summary judgment shall submit with its opposition a separate, short, and concise statement of material facts. The opposing statement shall admit, deny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material facts and unless a fact is admitted, shall support each denial or qualification by a record citation as required by this rule.</blockquote>\n<p>Local Rule 56(c). Rule 56(e) sets forth in mandatory terms the result of failure to follow Rule 56(c): \"Facts contained in a supporting or opposing statement of material facts, if supported by record citations as required by this rule, <i>shall be deemed admitted unless properly controverted.</i>\" Local Rule 56(e) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The purpose of this rule is to relieve the district court of any responsibility to ferret through the record to discern whether any material fact is genuinely in dispute.<sup>[2]</sup> We have upheld the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> application of the rule. <i>Mariani-Colon v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</i> 511 F.3d 216, 219 (1st Cir.2007). We review the \"deeming order\" for an abuse of discretion. <i>Hernandez v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.,</i> 486 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Here, the appellants failed to submit a separate statement of material facts. Nor did they anywhere in their opposition undertake to \"admit, deny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material facts.\" The appellants did include five facts in their opposition to the motion, but those facts are not explicitly directed at qualifying or contradicting specific facts in the plaintiffs' statement, nor are they presented in an \"opposing statement\" \"separate\" from the opposition itself.<sup>[3]</sup> The language of the rule is plain, and the appellants' conduct obviously falls within its scope. The district court therefore was within its discretion to deem the facts in the statement of material facts admitted.</p>\n<p>When summary judgment is granted after a deeming order, we are bound by the order as well, provided it was not an abuse of the district court's discretion. If it were otherwise, then the task of sifting through the record for genuine issues of material fact would merely have been transferred from the district court, at summary judgment, to the appellate court, on appeal of that summary judgment. The anti-ferret rule would thus be rendered toothless. The appellants do not contest the district court's deeming order. Nor do they seek to controvert any of the facts in plaintiffs' statement. Rather, they claim that the facts therein and in the remainder of the record are insufficient as a matter of law to hold them liable for Aguirre's actions. Although they couch the issue in terms of genuine issues of material fact, their real arguments are these: first, that the conjugal legal partnership should not have liability imposed on it because there is insufficient evidence in the record that it received the benefit of Aguirre's actions; and second, that the plaintiffs have failed to introduce evidence establishing that González is liable under Puerto Rico law for her husband's commission of these torts. We examine each in turn.</p>\n<p>b. The Conjugal Legal Partnership</p>\n<p>Under Puerto Rico law, the conjugal legal partnership can be held responsible for torts committed by one spouse as long as the action that gave rise to the tort was for the benefit of the conjugal legal partnership. \"The generally acknowledged rule is that if the member's work is profitable for the community the liability will also fall on said community's property.\" <i>Asociacion De Proprietarios Del Condominio Villas De Playa I De Dorado Del Mar, Inc. v. Santa Barbara Company of Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> 12 P.R. Offic. Trans. 41, 112 D.P.R. 33 (1982). This has been the rule in Puerto Rico since <i>Lugo-Montalvo v. Gonzalez-Manon,</i> 4 P.R. Offic. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> Trans. 517, 104 D.P.R. 372 (1975). In that case, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court held the conjugal legal partnership shared the husband's potential liability in a malpractice action. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote>While [the husband] is married, everything he earns exercising his profession goes to the community property. In the course of his professional practice he may incur civil liability for malpractice. Should he be the only one liable with his separate property, or should he have the backing of the community for which he works? . . . [H]is professional economical endeavor benefits the bulk of the community property and the latter should also be liable when the obligation arises.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 525-26. So it is here. Alvin Aguirre earned money from his business activities, money that went to the conjugal legal partnership. His business activities included the fraudulent transactions at issue. Therefore the conjugal legal partnership, which has yet to be settled, is liable. The appellants' contention that Aguirre was acting on behalf of the defendant corporations and therefore not for the benefit of the conjugal legal partnership is an argument that was squarely rejected by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court twenty-five years ago. \"[R]espondents' argument that since it was not the marital community that directly received the income of engineer Ariel Gutiérrez, but rather another artificial person who received itSociedad E.H.G. Arquitectos e Ingenierosit is exempted from liability, fails to convince us.\" <i>Asociacion De Proprietarios Del Condominio Villas De Playa I De Dorado Del Mar, Inc.,</i> 12 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 61, 112 D.P.R. 33.</p>\n<p>This provides a basis for the liability of the conjugal legal partnership even if González herself were not liable for the actions of her husband. But, as we establish below, the district court was right to hold her liable as well.</p>\n<p>c. Marilyn González-Toro</p>\n<p>The district court also found González jointly and severally liable for the acts of her husband. The district court based summary judgment on Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code. \"A person, who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage done.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court determined that González negligently assisted the fraud. We instead affirm the judgment because the evidence supports a finding of \"fault.\" The terms \"fault\" and \"negligence\" used here have specific meanings in the civil code context of Puerto Rico law. \"Fault consists in the failure to exercise due diligence, the use of which would have prevented the wrongful result. Due diligence is that which one can expect from the average human being, the good paterfamilias.\" <i>Jimenez v. Pelegrina Espinet,</i> 12 P.R. Offic. Trans. 881, 886 (1982); <i>see also Gierbolini v. Employers Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 4 P.R. Offic. Trans. 1197, 1201-02 (1976) (\"[F]ault requires the execution of a positive act causing a damage to another person different from the one who executed it, and, in turn, negligence supposes an omission producing the same effect, although both have in common that the act be executed or the omission incurred without an injurious intent.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) (citation omitted)). Further, it is an oft-cited precept of Puerto Rico law that \"the concept of fault 'is as broad as the behavior of human beings, and that it includes any fault that causes harm or injury.'\" <i>Bonilla v. Chardon,</i> 18 P.R. Offic. Trans. 696, 709 (1987) (quoting <i>Colon v. Romero Barcelo,</i> 112 D.P.R. 573, 579 (1982)).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> In granting summary judgment, the district court pointed to González's behavior both during the frauds and afterwards. During the frauds, González was a director, officer, incorporator, or resident agent for all of the defendant corporations. After the divorce, when she knew Aguirre was subject to an attachment order and was being investigated for possible criminal charges, she continued to receive money from him.</p>\n<p>On appeal, González argues that the funds she received came from corporations other than the defendant corporations, and that she cannot be subject to a judgment of negligence because she owed no duty to the plaintiffs. Considered in the context of the statement of uncontested material facts, neither contention avails her. The fact that the funds came from different corporations is irrelevant. The statement of uncontested material facts cited to González's own statements in the record that all or nearly all the money she received came from Aguirre. In the opposition to summary judgment, the appellants did set forth that the funds came from other corporations. But because appellants failed to satisfy the anti-ferret rule, we accept those facts only to the extent that they do not contradict the facts deemed admitted by the district court.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Here, the two sets of facts are easy to harmonize. González was not lying under oath when she said at the attachment hearing that her ex-husband had given her the money; and it is correct to say that the wire transfers came from corporations that were not defendants in this case. Even viewing these facts in the light most favorable to the appellants, the record is clear that Aguirre was using these other corporations to disburse funds to González, funds she knew or should have known were subject to the attachment order.</p>\n<p>The appellants spend considerable time in their brief making this out to be a case of piercing the corporate veil. But it is not. Rather, this is a case where the established facts point to a person aiding her spouse by participating in the creation and administration of corporations used to defraud, and then aiding him again by receiving funds from him even though she knew he was under an attachment order and being sued to recover the money those corporations had fraudulently obtained. Even assuming that González is not liable for the actions of defendant corporations by virtue of her role in them, she is still liable because she helped her husband carry out these schemes and helped him dispose of the money.</p>\n<p>Turning to the appellants' contention that González owed no duty to the appellees, it is true that the district court did not spell out the duty owed. Nevertheless, summary judgment was equally proper under the alternative \"fault\" standard in Puerto Rico law. \"We may affirm a summary judgment decision on any basis apparent in the record.\" <i>Perry v. Wolaver,</i> 506 F.3d 48, 53 (1st Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Uncle Henry's, Inc. v. Plaut Consulting Co.,</i> 399 F.3d 33, 41 (1st Cir.2005)). Here, the uncontested material facts support summary judgment because no reasonable construction of them excuses González from willfully <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> receiving money from her ex-husband when she knew he was subject to an attachment order in this case. González had actual knowledge of the attachment order because she had defended against the same order. While perhaps her earlier actions, viewed alone, could have been put down to ignorance or a good-faith belief that her husband had enlisted her aid in incorporating and administering these corporations for legitimate business purposes, such an inference is rendered unreasonable by her subsequent actions. The district court properly assessed the facts in context and supportably found no contested issue of material fact to preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Alvin Aguirre-González has since been arrested and pled guilty to 18 counts of mail fraud. During the pendency of this appeal he was sentenced to 57 months' imprisonment, forfeiture of one and a half million dollars, and restitution of nearly five million dollars. <i>See United States v. Aguirre-González,</i> 3:05-cr-00387-PG (D.P.R.). An appeal is pending.</p>\n<p>[2]  The deeming order is both a sanction for the parties and a balm for the district court: the parties are given an incentive to conform to the rule (provided they wish to have their version of the facts considered), and the district court is in any case relieved of the obligation to ferret through the record.</p>\n<p>[3]  We have previously held that failure to set forth a paragraph-by-paragraph admission or denial of the movant's material facts justifies a deeming order even where the opposition does propound other facts. <i>See </i><i>Hernandez,</i> 486 F.3d at 7. <i>Hernandez</i> leaves open the possibility that facts marshaled in opposition might be accepted to \"augment\" the facts contained in movant's statement of material facts, rather than contradict them. <i>Id.</i> at n. 2. Without deciding the issue of whether the district court could have excluded these facts entirely, we proceed to evaluate the record as though those facts were accepted to augment the movant's facts; as we shall see, they do not change the result.</p>\n<p>[4]  We repeat that because the opposition to summary judgment did not include an \"Opposing Statement of Material Facts\" as required by Local Rule 56(c), the district court would likely have been free to disregard the facts in the opposition itself. We do not decide that question because it is not presented to us. In this case the district court did not explicitly reject the facts, nor did it explicitly consider them. It makes no difference whether these opposing facts are considered because they can easily be harmonized with the view of the evidence propounded in the statement of uncontested material facts.</p>\n\n</div>",

Philip Morris USA, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202726\"><a href=\"/opinion/202726/caban-hernandez-v-phillip-morris-usa/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Here, the appellants failed to submit a separate statement of material facts. Nor did they anywhere in their opposition undertake to \"admit, deny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material facts.\" The appellants did include five facts in their opposition to the motion, but those facts are not explicitly directed at qualifying or contradicting specific facts in the plaintiffs' statement, nor are they presented in an \"opposing statement\" \"separate\" from the opposition itself.<sup>[3]</sup> The language of the rule is plain, and the appellants' conduct obviously falls within its scope. The district court therefore was within its discretion to deem the facts in the statement of material facts admitted.</p>\n<p>When summary judgment is granted after a deeming order, we are bound by the order as well, provided it was not an abuse of the district court's discretion. If it were otherwise, then the task of sifting through the record for genuine issues of material fact would merely have been transferred from the district court, at summary judgment, to the appellate court, on appeal of that summary judgment. The anti-ferret rule would thus be rendered toothless. The appellants do not contest the district court's deeming order. Nor do they seek to controvert any of the facts in plaintiffs' statement. Rather, they claim that the facts therein and in the remainder of the record are insufficient as a matter of law to hold them liable for Aguirre's actions. Although they couch the issue in terms of genuine issues of material fact, their real arguments are these: first, that the conjugal legal partnership should not have liability imposed on it because there is insufficient evidence in the record that it received the benefit of Aguirre's actions; and second, that the plaintiffs have failed to introduce evidence establishing that González is liable under Puerto Rico law for her husband's commission of these torts. We examine each in turn.</p>\n<p>b. The Conjugal Legal Partnership</p>\n<p>Under Puerto Rico law, the conjugal legal partnership can be held responsible for torts committed by one spouse as long as the action that gave rise to the tort was for the benefit of the conjugal legal partnership. \"The generally acknowledged rule is that if the member's work is profitable for the community the liability will also fall on said community's property.\" <i>Asociacion De Proprietarios Del Condominio Villas De Playa I De Dorado Del Mar, Inc. v. Santa Barbara Company of Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></span>, 112 D.P.R. 33 (1982). This has been the rule in Puerto Rico since <i>Lugo-Montalvo v. Gonzalez-Manon,</i> 4 P.R. Offic. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> Trans. 517, 104 D.P.R. 372 (1975). In that case, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court held the conjugal legal partnership shared the husband's potential liability in a malpractice action. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote>While [the husband] is married, everything he earns exercising his profession goes to the community property. In the course of his professional practice he may incur civil liability for malpractice. Should he be the only one liable with his separate property, or should he have the backing of the community for which he works? . . . [H]is professional economical endeavor benefits the bulk of the community property and the latter should also be liable when the obligation arises.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 525-26. So it is here. Alvin Aguirre earned money from his business activities, money that went to the conjugal legal partnership. His business activities included the fraudulent transactions at issue. Therefore the conjugal legal partnership, which has yet to be settled, is liable. The appellants' contention that Aguirre was acting on behalf of the defendant corporations and therefore not for the benefit of the conjugal legal partnership is an argument that was squarely rejected by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court twenty-five years ago. \"[R]espondents' argument that since it was not the marital community that directly received the income of engineer Ariel Gutiérrez, but rather another artificial person who received itSociedad E.H.G. Arquitectos e Ingenierosit is exempted from liability, fails to convince us.\" <i>Asociacion De Proprietarios Del Condominio Villas De Playa I De Dorado Del Mar, Inc.,</i> 12 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 61, 112 D.P.R. 33.</p>\n<p>This provides a basis for the liability of the conjugal legal partnership even if González herself were not liable for the actions of her husband. But, as we establish below, the district court was right to hold her liable as well.</p>\n<p>c. Marilyn González-Toro</p>\n<p>The district court also found González jointly and severally liable for the acts of her husband. The district court based summary judgment on Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code. \"A person, who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage done.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court determined that González negligently assisted the fraud. We instead affirm the judgment because the evidence supports a finding of \"fault.\" The terms \"fault\" and \"negligence\" used here have specific meanings in the civil code context of Puerto Rico law. \"Fault consists in the failure to exercise due diligence, the use of which would have prevented the wrongful result. Due diligence is that which one can expect from the average human being, the good paterfamilias.\" <i>Jimenez v. Pelegrina Espinet,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></span>, 886 (1982); <i>see also Gierbolini v. Employers Fire Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">1197</span></span>, 1201-02 (1976) (\"[F]ault requires the execution of a positive act causing a damage to another person different from the one who executed it, and, in turn, negligence supposes an omission producing the same effect, although both have in common that the act be executed or the omission incurred without an injurious intent.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) (citation omitted)). Further, it is an oft-cited precept of Puerto Rico law that \"the concept of fault 'is as broad as the behavior of human beings, and that it includes any fault that causes harm or injury.'\" <i>Bonilla v. Chardon,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></span>, 709 (1987) (quoting <i>Colon v. Romero Barcelo,</i> 112 D.P.R. 573, 579 (1982)).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> In granting summary judgment, the district court pointed to González's behavior both during the frauds and afterwards. During the frauds, González was a director, officer, incorporator, or resident agent for all of the defendant corporations. After the divorce, when she knew Aguirre was subject to an attachment order and was being investigated for possible criminal charges, she continued to receive money from him.</p>\n<p>On appeal, González argues that the funds she received came from corporations other than the defendant corporations, and that she cannot be subject to a judgment of negligence because she owed no duty to the plaintiffs. Considered in the context of the statement of uncontested material facts, neither contention avails her. The fact that the funds came from different corporations is irrelevant. The statement of uncontested material facts cited to González's own statements in the record that all or nearly all the money she received came from Aguirre. In the opposition to summary judgment, the appellants did set forth that the funds came from other corporations. But because appellants failed to satisfy the anti-ferret rule, we accept those facts only to the extent that they do not contradict the facts deemed admitted by the district court.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Here, the two sets of facts are easy to harmonize. González was not lying under oath when she said at the attachment hearing that her ex-husband had given her the money; and it is correct to say that the wire transfers came from corporations that were not defendants in this case. Even viewing these facts in the light most favorable to the appellants, the record is clear that Aguirre was using these other corporations to disburse funds to González, funds she knew or should have known were subject to the attachment order.</p>\n<p>The appellants spend considerable time in their brief making this out to be a case of piercing the corporate veil. But it is not. Rather, this is a case where the established facts point to a person aiding her spouse by participating in the creation and administration of corporations used to defraud, and then aiding him again by receiving funds from him even though she knew he was under an attachment order and being sued to recover the money those corporations had fraudulently obtained. Even assuming that González is not liable for the actions of defendant corporations by virtue of her role in them, she is still liable because she helped her husband carry out these schemes and helped him dispose of the money.</p>\n<p>Turning to the appellants' contention that González owed no duty to the appellees, it is true that the district court did not spell out the duty owed. Nevertheless, summary judgment was equally proper under the alternative \"fault\" standard in Puerto Rico law. \"We may affirm a summary judgment decision on any basis apparent in the record.\" <i>Perry v. Wolaver,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202991\"><a href=\"/opinion/202991/perry-v-wolaver/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Uncle Henry's, Inc. v. Plaut Consulting Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789353\"><a href=\"/opinion/789353/uncle-henrys-inc-appellantcross-appellee-v-plaut-consulting-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir.2005)). Here, the uncontested material facts support summary judgment because no reasonable construction of them excuses González from willfully <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> receiving money from her ex-husband when she knew he was subject to an attachment order in this case. González had actual knowledge of the attachment order because she had defended against the same order. While perhaps her earlier actions, viewed alone, could have been put down to ignorance or a good-faith belief that her husband had enlisted her aid in incorporating and administering these corporations for legitimate business purposes, such an inference is rendered unreasonable by her subsequent actions. The district court properly assessed the facts in context and supportably found no contested issue of material fact to preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Alvin Aguirre-González has since been arrested and pled guilty to 18 counts of mail fraud. During the pendency of this appeal he was sentenced to 57 months' imprisonment, forfeiture of one and a half million dollars, and restitution of nearly five million dollars. <i>See United States v. Aguirre-González,</i> 3:05-cr-00387-PG (D.P.R.). An appeal is pending.</p>\n<p>[2]  The deeming order is both a sanction for the parties and a balm for the district court: the parties are given an incentive to conform to the rule (provided they wish to have their version of the facts considered), and the district court is in any case relieved of the obligation to ferret through the record.</p>\n<p>[3]  We have previously held that failure to set forth a paragraph-by-paragraph admission or denial of the movant's material facts justifies a deeming order even where the opposition does propound other facts. <i>See </i><i>Hernandez,</i> 486 F.3d at 7. <i>Hernandez</i> leaves open the possibility that facts marshaled in opposition might be accepted to \"augment\" the facts contained in movant's statement of material facts, rather than contradict them. <i>Id.</i> at n. 2. Without deciding the issue of whether the district court could have excluded these facts entirely, we proceed to evaluate the record as though those facts were accepted to augment the movant's facts; as we shall see, they do not change the result.</p>\n<p>[4]  We repeat that because the opposition to summary judgment did not include an \"Opposing Statement of Material Facts\" as required by Local Rule 56(c), the district court would likely have been free to disregard the facts in the opposition itself. We do not decide that question because it is not presented to us. In this case the district court did not explicitly reject the facts, nor did it explicitly consider them. It makes no difference whether these opposing facts are considered because they can easily be harmonized with the view of the evidence propounded in the statement of uncontested material facts.</p>\n\n</div>",
