This is an appeal in which the\n\napplicable standard of review determines the outcome.         In the\n\nunderlying action, plaintiff-appellant Madelux International, Inc.\n\n(MII) sued three defendants — Barama Co. Ltd. (Barama), Sterling\n\nWood Products Corp. (Sterling), and Aljoma Lumber, Inc. (Aljoma) —\n\nfor pecuniary damages.     Its amended complaint (the operative\n\npleading for present purposes) alleged that the lead defendant,\n\nBarama, had transgressed the Dealer's Act, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,\n\n§ 278a (Law 75), by terminating, without the required statutory\n\nnotice or cause, a purported exclusive distributorship agreement\n\nrelating to the importation and sale of certain plywood panels in\n\nPuerto Rico. Relatedly, the amended complaint alleged that another\n\ndefendant, Aljoma, had tortiously interfered with these exclusive\n\ndistribution rights.1   See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5141.\n\n          The case went to trial before the district court on\n\nDecember 6, 2004.   After MII rested, the court, ruling ore sponte,\n\ngranted Aljoma's motion to dismiss.   At the conclusion of all the\n\nevidence, the court took the remaining issues under advisement. It\n\nsubsequently wrote a thoughtful rescript, in which it exonerated\n\nBarama and Sterling from liability under Law 75.       See Madelux\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The allegations against Sterling were vague and, in all\nevents, the parties have treated Sterling as a marketing arm of\nBarama.   Accordingly, there is no need to discuss Sterling’s\nliability separately.\n\n                                -2-\n\fInt'l, Inc. v. Barama Co., 364 F. Supp. 2d 68, 75 (D.P.R. 2005).\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n            We need not tarry.          The district court, as evidenced by\n\nits rescript, id. at 73-74, correctly understood the applicable law\n\n(indeed, MII's appellate counsel, when pointedly questioned at oral\n\nargument, was unable to identify any material error of law).                    The\n\ncase   against      Barama       and    Sterling   therefore     turns   on     the\n\nsupportability of the district court's factual findings.                        See\n\nSierra Fria Corp. v. Donald J. Evans, P.C., 127 F.3d 175, 180 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).       We can disturb those findings if, and only if, they\n\nare clearly erroneous, that is, if \"after careful evaluation of the\n\nevidence,    we    are    left   with    an   abiding    conviction   that    those\n\nfindings . . . are simply wrong.\"               State Police Ass'n v. Comm'r,\n\n125 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1997); accord Cumpiano v. Banco Santander\n\nP.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990); Reliance Steel Prods. Co.\n\nv. Nat'l Fire Ins. Co., 880 F.2d 575, 576 (1st Cir. 1989).                       In\n\nconducting    this       tamisage,     credibility      determinations   must    be\n\nregarded as falling squarely within the trier's domain. See, e.g.,\n\nAnthony v. Sundlun, 952 F.2d 603, 606 (1st Cir. 1991).                It follows\n\ninexorably that the loser in a bench trial invariably faces a steep\n\nuphill climb when it aspires to impugn the trial court's factual\n\nfindings.\n\n            Here, the attempt is hopeless.              The applicability of Law\n\n75 depends, inter alia, on proof that protected distributorship\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\frights exist.   See Borschow Hosp. & Med. Supplies, Inc. v. Cesar\n\nCastillo Inc., 96 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 1996); Vulcan Tools of P.R.\n\nv. Makita USA, Inc., 23 F.3d 564, 569 (1st Cir. 1994).     The lower\n\ncourt found, on conflicting facts and shades of meaning, that MII\n\nnever enjoyed any such protected distributorship rights.          See\n\nMadelux Int’l, 364 F. Supp. 2d at 74-75.      We are satisfied, after\n\nclose perscrutation of the record, that this finding was not\n\nclearly erroneous.   Thus, we must respect it.\n\n          MII argues that two pieces of correspondence — one dated\n\nDecember 11, 1995, and the other dated June 19, 1999 — compel a\n\ncontrary finding.    We do not agree.      While those letters, in\n\ncombination with other evidence, might have supported an inference\n\nfavorable to MII, the district judge, sitting as the finder of the\n\nfacts, chose not to draw such an inference.    See id. at 75.   Where,\n\nas here, the trier chooses between competing inferences, each of\n\nwhich is reasonable in light of the evidence as a whole, that\n\nchoice cannot be deemed clearly erroneous.2     See Anderson v. City\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      MII also argues that, apart from Law 75, it was entitled to\nrecover on one or more other theories, namely, (i) for breach of\ncontract, (ii) as a sales representative under Law 21, P.R. Laws\nAnn. tit. 10, § 279, and (iii) under common law. These arguments\nwere not raised below and, accordingly, cannot be advanced on\nappeal. See Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen & Helpers Union,\nLocal No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.\n1992) (\"If any principle is settled in this circuit, it is that,\nabsent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not\nraised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first\ntime on appeal.\").\n\n                                -4-\n\fof Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985); Cumpiano, 902 F.2d\n\nat 152.\n\n            The same sort of reasoning applies to the entry of\n\njudgment in favor of Aljoma.     Pertinently, Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 52(c) provides that \"[i]f during a trial without a jury\n\na party has been fully heard on an issue and the court finds\n\nagainst the party on that issue, the court may enter judgment\"\n\nagainst that party without further ado.      That is precisely what\n\ntranspired here.\n\n            When a trial court enters judgment under Rule 52(c), we\n\nscrutinize its findings of fact for clear error.3    See Marina Bay\n\nRealty Trust LLC v. United States, 407 F.3d 418, 423 (1st Cir.\n\n2005). In this instance, the court found as a fact that Aljoma had\n\nno awareness of any protected distributorship rights held by MII\n\n(and, thus, was not liable for tortious interference with the\n\nsame).    See New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v. SprintCom, Inc., 287\n\nF.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2002) (explaining that, in bringing such a\n\nclaim under Puerto Rico law, \"the plaintiff must show that the\n\ndefendant intended to interfere with the contract, knowing that\n\nthis interference would cause injury to the plaintiff\").    Bearing\n\nin mind that MII had the burden of proof on the issue of knowing\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      With respect to Aljoma, as was the case with respect to\nBarama and Sterling, MII has not shown that the ruling appealed\nfrom is infected by any material error of law.\n\n                                 -5-\n\finterference, see id., this finding, though perhaps not inevitable,\n\nwas surely not clearly erroneous.\n\n            There is one remaining loose end.     MII requests for the\n\nfirst time on appeal that we certify a question as to the meaning\n\nand scope of Law 75 to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court.            We deny that\n\nrequest.    MII chose a federal forum and eschewed any request to the\n\ndistrict court for certification.          Even in far more auspicious\n\ncircumstances,    we   have   not   been   receptive   to   requests     for\n\ncertification newly asserted on appeal, see, e.g., Nieves v. Univ.\n\nof P.R., 7 F.3d 270, 278 (1st Cir. 1993), and here, the district\n\ncourt’s     supportable    factual     finding    that      no     protected\n\ndistributorship rights existed undermines the argument that some\n\nunsettled issue of Puerto Rico law might be controlling.               Under\n\nthese inauspicious circumstances, we once again refuse a belated\n\nrequest for certification.     See, e.g., id.; Fischer v. Bar Harbor\n\nBanking & Trust Co., 857 F.2d 4, 8 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n            We need go no further.4        For the reasons elucidated\n\nabove, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n     4\n      MII also complains of an error regarding the lower court’s\nhandling of expert testimony.    That testimony, however, related\nalmost exclusively to damages.      Since we affirm the district\ncourt's finding of no liability, the issue of damages (and, hence,\nthe evidentiary issue) is moot. See Tiernan v. Blyth, Eastman,\nDillon & Co., 719 F.2d 1, 5 n.5 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f",

That is precisely what\n\ntranspired here.\n\n            When a trial court enters judgment under Rule 52(c), we\n\nscrutinize its findings of fact for clear error.3    See Marina Bay\n\nRealty Trust LLC v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 423 (1st Cir.\n\n2005). In this instance, the court found as a fact that Aljoma had\n\nno awareness of any protected distributorship rights held by MII\n\n(and, thus, was not liable for tortious interference with the\n\nsame).    See New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v. SprintCom, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199913\"><a href=\"/opinion/199913/new-comm-wireless-v-sprint/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10 (1st Cir. 2002) (explaining that, in bringing such a\n\nclaim under Puerto Rico law, \"the plaintiff must show that the\n\ndefendant intended to interfere with the contract, knowing that\n\nthis interference would cause injury to the plaintiff\").    Bearing\n\nin mind that MII had the burden of proof on the issue of knowing\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      With respect to Aljoma, as was the case with respect to\nBarama and Sterling, MII has not shown that the ruling appealed\nfrom is infected by any material error of law.\n\n                                 -5-\n\finterference, see id., this finding, though perhaps not inevitable,\n\nwas surely not clearly erroneous.\n\n            There is one remaining loose end.     MII requests for the\n\nfirst time on appeal that we certify a question as to the meaning\n\nand scope of Law 75 to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court.            We deny that\n\nrequest.    MII chose a federal forum and eschewed any request to the\n\ndistrict court for certification.          Even in far more auspicious\n\ncircumstances,    we   have   not   been   receptive   to   requests     for\n\ncertification newly asserted on appeal, see, e.g., Nieves v. Univ.\n\nof P.R., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194980\"><a href=\"/opinion/194980/marta-v-u-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 278 (1st Cir. 1993), and here, the district\n\ncourt’s     supportable    factual     finding    that      no     protected\n\ndistributorship rights existed undermines the argument that some\n\nunsettled issue of Puerto Rico law might be controlling.               Under\n\nthese inauspicious circumstances, we once again refuse a belated\n\nrequest for certification.     See, e.g., id.; Fischer v. Bar Harbor\n\nBanking & Trust Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511755\"><a href=\"/opinion/511755/dr-eg-fischer-v-bar-harbor-banking-and-trust-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">857</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n            We need go no further.4        For the reasons elucidated\n\nabove, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n     4\n      MII also complains of an error regarding the lower court’s\nhandling of expert testimony.    That testimony, however, related\nalmost exclusively to damages.      Since we affirm the district\ncourt's finding of no liability, the issue of damages (and, hence,\nthe evidentiary issue) is moot.
