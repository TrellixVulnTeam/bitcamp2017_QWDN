George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                     FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Robert M.

Defendant, Easton Wilson, appeals from a\n\nsentence imposed before the United States Supreme Court's recent\n\ndecision in United States v. Booker, __ U.S. __, 125 S. Ct. 738\n\n(2005).    In his original brief (filed before Booker was decided),\n\nWilson argued that his sentence had been enhanced based on judge-\n\nmade findings, in violation of Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. ___,\n\n124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004).1          In a supplement Booker brief, Wilson\n\nargues that the district court erred in sentencing him under a\n\nmandatory Guidelines system and that he is entitled to resentencing\n\nin conformance with Booker. The government opposes a remand.\n\n            Wilson maintains that he preserved a claim of Booker\n\nerror below, by arguing in his objection to the presentence report\n\nthat the court's fact-finding as to drug quantity violated Apprendi\n\nv.   New   Jersey,   530   U.S.   466    (2000),   and   its   progeny.   The\n\ngovernment concedes that Wilson made an Apprendi argument before\n\nthe district court.        That is all that we require to preserve a\n\nclaim of Booker error.       See United States\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       Because we conclude that Wilson is entitled to a remand and\nresentencing based on his claim in his supplemental brief, we need\nnot consider the claim in his original brief that the district\ncourt erred in determining drug quantity. The sentence imposed\nafter remand will be subject to review for reasonableness. See\nUnited States v. Vazquez-Rivera, ___ F.3d ___, No. 02-1818, 2005 WL\n1163672,slip op. at 29 (1st Cir. May 18, 2005).\n\n                                        -2-\n\fv. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir. 2005) (stating that\n\n\"[t]he argument that a Booker error occurred is preserved if the\n\ndefendant below argued Apprendi\").\n\n            Because Wilson's claim of Booker error was preserved, the\n\ngovernment has the burden of showing harmlessness. Chapman v.\n\nCalifornia, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967); United States v. Ventura-Cruel,\n\n356 F.3d 55, 64 (1st Cir. 2003).                 \"Where an error relates to the\n\nvalidity of a defendant's sentence, it is harmless only if it did\n\nnot   affect    the      district   court's       choice    of   sentence.\"    United\n\nStates v. Schlifer, 403 F.3d 849, 854 (7th Cir. 2005).                     Where the\n\nerror is of constitutional magnitude, as here, the government must\n\nprove that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. United States\n\nv. Vazquez-Rivera, ___ F.3d ___, No. 02-1818, 2005 WL 1163672, slip\n\nop. at 25 (1st Cir. May 18, 2005).               Therefore, on appellate review\n\nthe government has the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, that \"a lower sentence would not have been imposed had the\n\nGuidelines been advisory.\"              Id. at 25.\n\n            The government has not met this heavy burden.                     In its\n\nsupplemental brief, the government argues that the imposition of a\n\nsentence in the middle of the applicable Guidelines range and the\n\nsentencing      judge's      express      finding     that       the   sentence   was\n\n\"appropriate,\" with reference to the statutory sentencing factors\n\ncontained      in   18    U.S.C.    ยง    3553(a)(2),       satisfies    its   burden.\n\nAlthough the result might be different under plain error review,\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fthe government has not met its burden of demonstrating harmless\n\nerror beyond a reasonable doubt on that showing.\n\n           Accordingly, the sentence is vacated and the case is\n\nremanded   for   resentencing   under    the   standards   articulated   in\n\nBooker, 125 S. Ct. at 764-65.           We intimate no view as to the\n\nappropriate sentence to be imposed.\n\n           The conviction is affirmed, the sentence is vacated, and\n\nthe matter is remanded for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
