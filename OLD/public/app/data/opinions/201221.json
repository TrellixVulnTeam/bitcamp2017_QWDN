Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Maria H. Sandoval on brief for appellant.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Nelson Perez-Sosa,\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Lynn M. Doble-Salicrup,\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            August 26, 2004\n\f     Per Curiam. After a thorough review of the record and of the\n\nparties' submissions, we affirm the district court's decision\n\ndenying     the    request    for         pre-trial   release.       The\n\ndefendant/appellant, Wilfredo Figueroa Zapata (\"Figueroa\"), faces\n\na controlled substance charge carrying at least a ten-year maximum\n\nsentence; indeed, he faces a possible maximum sentence of life\n\nimprisonment.     See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A).        Therefore, it is\n\npresumed that no condition or combination of conditions will\n\nreasonably assure the safety of the community if Figueroa is\n\nreleased.    See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e).       Figueroa's arguments that he\n\nonly bought from, and did not sell to, the lead defendant in this\n\ncase, and that he dealt no more than five kilograms of cocaine, are\n\nwholly unconvincing.\n\n     Figueroa argues that the district court did not, as it should\n\nhave, focus on whether he was likely to resume illegal drug dealing\n\nif he were released. Given the evidence presented at the detention\n\nhearing, the district court was not required to conclude that the\n\nconspiracy had shut down or that Figueroa would not resume his\n\nillegal activities if released.      We find no error in the district\n\ncourt's decision that Figueroa had not overcome the presumption.\n\n     Figueroa introduced into evidence letters of support from his\n\nfamily and friends, and he argued that these along with family\n\nmedical concerns offered additional reasons to release him pending\n\ntrial.    This evidence arguably tends to rebut the presumption that\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fFigueroa might flee pending trial (though we take no position on\n\nthat question); but the district court based its detention decision\n\non dangerousness, not on the relative risk of flight presented. It\n\nis that decision we review.   We see no error in the decision.\n\n     We deny as moot Figueroa's motion to reconsider this court's\n\norder extending the government's deadline for filing its brief; and\n\nwe note that the extension of time was appropriate, given that the\n\ncourt also had granted appellant an extension of time within which\n\nto file certified translations in support of his appeal.\n\n     Affirmed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f",
