Appellant, Glen P.\n\nRolland (\"Rolland\"), an employee of the United States Postal\n\nService (\"USPS\"), appeals from the district court's award of\n\nsummary judgment to John E. Potter (\"Potter\"), Postmaster General\n\nof the USPS.     We AFFIRM.\n\n                                         I.\n\n            On March 19, 1994, while working as a forklift driver at\n\nthe USPS Bulk Mail Center in Springfield, Massachusetts, Rolland\n\nsuffered    an   on-the-job       injury      that    resulted   in    a    ruptured\n\nintervertebral disc at L4-L5.            Following surgery and a period of\n\nrecovery, Rolland returned to his job as a forklift driver in late\n\nJune, 1994.      Not long thereafter, having continued to experience\n\nsubstantial      pain    and     limitation      of    movement,      Rolland       was\n\ntemporarily reassigned to a light-duty position as a forklift\n\noperator's assistant.\n\n            In   1997,    following      an    extensive     medical       review    of\n\nRolland's    injury     and     condition,     the    USPS   offered       Rolland    a\n\npermanent \"rehabilitation position\" as a modified mail handler.\n\nAwarded    through      the    USPS's   workers'      compensation     program,       a\n\n\"rehabilitation position\" is one that the USPS provides to an\n\nemployee who has permanent restrictions resulting from an on-the-\n\njob   injury.         Rolland     accepted      the     USPS's   offer       of     the\n\nrehabilitation position, and he has continued in that \"rehab\"\n\nposition—the modified mail handler position—since 1997.\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f              On June 14, 2002, Rolland filed a formal charge of\n\ndisability discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission (\"EEOC\").      Among other things, Rolland alleged that the\n\nUSPS    had    discriminated     against   him    in     violation    of   the\n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 701-795, by denying him\n\novertime hours based on his status as a \"rehab\" employee.              An EEOC\n\nAdministrative Judge (\"AJ\") denied Rolland's claim for relief,\n\nfinding that Rolland failed to establish a cognizable claim under\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act.        On appeal to the EEOC, the AJ's decision\n\nwas     affirmed.      Rolland     thereafter    filed     this    disability\n\ndiscrimination action in federal district court.\n\n              In his federal complaint, Rolland again asserted a claim\n\nunder the Rehabilitation Act, alleging that he was a qualified\n\nindividual with a disability who was denied overtime work on the\n\nbasis    of   that   disability.     Potter     sought   summary     judgment,\n\narguing—among other things—that Rolland was not entitled to relief\n\nbecause he did not have a disability within the meaning of the\n\nRehabilitation Act.      As noted by Potter, Rolland admitted during\n\ndepositions that he can (1) drive himself to work; (2) lift sacks\n\nweighing up to twenty pounds; (3) mow the lawn; (4) prepare meals;\n\n(5) do laundry; (6) clear snow with a snow blower; (7) stand for\n\nlong hours; (8) take extended walks while wearing a knee brace; and\n\n(9) perform all of the duties assigned to him as part of his\n\n\"rehab\" job.     In response to Potter's motion for summary judgment,\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fRolland argued that, because the USPS had determined that he was\n\ndisabled    for    purposes     of    assigning    him   to    a   rehabilitation\n\nposition, the agency was estopped from arguing otherwise for\n\npurposes of Rolland's Rehabilitation Act claim.\n\n            The district court granted Potter's motion for summary\n\njudgment, in part finding that Rolland failed to present evidence\n\nestablishing      that     he   had    a   disability    for   purposes       of   his\n\nRehabilitation Act claim.             The district court rejected Rolland's\n\nassertion   that     his    eligibility      to   participate      in   the   USPS's\n\nrehabilitation program constituted, by itself, sufficient proof of\n\na qualifying disability.              Rolland thereafter filed this timely\n\nappeal, raising only one issue: whether the district court erred in\n\nfinding that Rolland failed to establish that he was disabled for\n\npurposes of the Rehabilitation Act.\n\n                                           II.\n\n            We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nnon-movant.       Gomez-Perez v. Potter, 476 F.3d 54, 56-57 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n            The Rehabilitation Act provides that \"[n]o otherwise\n\nqualified individual with a disability in the United States, as\n\ndefined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by reason\n\nof her or his disability, . . . be subjected to discrimination\n\nunder any program or activity . . . conducted by . . . the United\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fStates Postal Service.\"      29 U.S.C. § 794(a).       Section 705(20)\n\ndefines an \"individual with a disability\" as \"any person who . . .\n\nhas a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one\n\nor more of such person's major life activities\" or \"has a record of\n\nsuch an impairment\" or \"is regarded as having such an impairment.\"\n\nId. § 705(20)(B).\n\n           In Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S.\n\n184   (2002),1   the   Supreme   Court   explained   that   the   phrases\n\n\"substantially limits\" and \"major life activities\" must be strictly\n\ninterpreted \"to create a demanding standard for qualifying as\n\ndisabled.\"   Id. at 197 (emphasis added).2       The Court emphasized\n\n\n      1\n        In Toyota, the plaintiff sued her former employer under the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12165,\nnot the Rehabilitation Act. The Supreme Court made clear, however,\nthat the phrase \"individual with a disability\" is defined in\nsubstantially the same manner in both statutes and should,\ntherefore, be given the same construction under both statutes.\nToyota, 534 U.S. at 194 (noting that Congress drew the ADA's\ndefinition of disability almost verbatim from the Rehabilitation\nAct).\n      2\n        The relevant caselaw reveals that the disability standard\nimposed by courts under the Rehabilitation Act has, indeed, been\ndemanding. See, e.g., Helfter v. United Parcel Serv., 115 F.3d\n613, 617 (8th Cir. 1997) (concluding that a mail sorter whose on-\nthe-job injuries resulted in permanent medical restrictions,\nincluding not only a lift limit of ten pounds frequently and twenty\npounds occasionally but also a restriction as to sustained, highly\nrepetitive activities using either hand, failed to show that she\nwas   disabled   within   the  meaning   of   federal   disability-\ndiscrimination laws); Carter v. Potter, No. 02-7326, 2004 WL\n2958428, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 21, 2004) (holding that a postal\nworker whose arthritis altogether prevented him from performing his\nduties as a letter carrier did not establish that he had a\n\"disability\" that substantially impaired his ability to engage in\na major life activity).\n\n                                   -5-\n\fthat, because the word \"major\" means \"important,\" the phrase \"major\n\nlife activities\" refers to those activities \"that are of central\n\nimportance to daily life.\" Id. The Court further emphasized that,\n\nbecause the word \"substantially\" suggests \"considerable\" or \"to a\n\nlarge degree,\" the phrase \"substantially limits\" disqualifies as\n\n\"disabilities\" any impairments that interfere in only a minor way\n\nwith an individual's major life activities.    Id. at 196-97.    In\n\nsum, the Court held that, to qualify as a disabled person under the\n\nRehabilitation Act, an individual must have a permanent or long\n\nterm impairment \"that prevents or severely restricts the individual\n\nfrom doing activities that are of central importance to most\n\npeople's daily lives.\"   Id. at 198.\n\n          The determination of whether a plaintiff has a qualifying\n\ndisability is made on a case-by-case basis.    Id.   To establish a\n\nqualifying disability, the plaintiff has the burden of proving (1)\n\nthat he or she suffers a physical or mental impairment; (2) that\n\nthe \"life activity\" limited by the impairment qualifies as \"major;\"\n\nand (3) that the limit imposed on the plaintiff's major life\n\nactivity is substantial.   Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,\n\n355 F.3d 6, 20 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          Here, Rolland's medical condition is described in the\n\nrecord as including a ruptured L4-L5 disc, sciatica, radiculopathy,\n\nand atrophy of both the thigh and calf muscles of his right leg.\n\nIt is undisputed that he has an impairment.    The issue, then, is\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fwhether     his    impairment        rises     to   the   level    of   one   that\n\n\"substantially limits one or more of . . . [his] major life\n\nactivities.\"\n\n            Rolland made little effort before the district court to\n\nestablish that his impairment substantially limits one or more of\n\nhis     major    life   activities.          Instead,     citing   no   authority\n\nwhatsoever, he argued that his status as a disabled individual was\n\nconclusively evidenced by his placement in a USPS rehabilitation\n\nposition.       In essence, he argued that the USPS was estopped from\n\ncollaterally attacking its own disability determination.\n\n            The Federal Employees Compensation Act (\"FECA\"), 5 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 8101-8193, establishes a federal workers' compensation program\n\nfor employees who suffer a \"disability\" as a result of an on-the-\n\njob injury.       Eschewing the Rehabilitation Act's more demanding\n\ndefinition of the term \"disability,\" Congress defined the term\n\n\"disability\" for workers' compensation purposes as the \"incapacity,\n\nbecause of an employment injury, to earn the wages the employee was\n\nreceiving at the time of the injury.\"               20 C.F.R. § 10.5(f).\n\n            Among other things, FECA requires federal agencies to\n\nplace    employees      in   their    former    positions,   or    in   equivalent\n\npositions, following recovery from compensable injuries.                  5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 8151.     To fulfill its FECA obligations to employees who suffer\n\ncompensable injuries, the USPS developed an injury compensation\n\nprogram that specifically addresses the reassignment of employees\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\finjured on the job. Under this program, employees whose on-the-job\n\ninjuries result in permanent restrictions are placed into new\n\nrehabilitation positions through the USPS's Rehabilitation Program.\n\nTo be eligible for participation in the Rehabilitation Program and,\n\nthereby, for placement in a rehabilitation position, an employee\n\nmust \"have a job-related, permanent partial disability documented\n\nby medical evidence.\"           United States Postal Service Handbook EL-\n\n505.       The record does not reveal how the USPS defines \"permanent\n\npartial      disability\"    for    purposes    of    its   injury     compensation\n\nprogram.3\n\n              Rolland     was   found   to    be    eligible    for   the    USPS's\n\nRehabilitation Program because the medical evidence established\n\nthat he had a job-related \"permanent partial disability.\" Based on\n\nthe record before it, the district court rejected Rolland's lone\n\nand unsupported argument that the USPS's finding of \"disability\"\n\nfor    purposes      of   its   worker's     compensation      program    was    the\n\nequivalent      of    a   \"disability\"       finding   for     purposes     of   the\n\n\n       3\n       In his reply brief, Rolland suggests—for the first time and\nwithout proper citation—that the USPS defines the word \"disability\"\nfor purposes of its injury compensation program exactly as the word\nis defined in the Rehabilitation Act. We do not consider, however,\narguments left unsaid in the district court and raised for the\nfirst time on appeal in a reply brief. See Sandstrom v. Chemlawn\nCorp., 904 F.2d 83, 87 (1st Cir.1990) (noting that an argument\nwhich is \"coherently pulled together for the first time in [a\nparty's] reply brief in [the court of appeals] is procedurally\ndefaulted\" and will not be considered); see also McCoy v. Mass.\nInst. of Tech., 950 F.2d 13, 21 (1st Cir. 1991) (explaining that\n\"[i]t is hornbook law that theories not raised squarely in the\ndistrict court cannot be surfaced for the first time on appeal\").\n\n                                        -8-\n\fRehabilitation Act. The district court did not err in this regard.\n\n            According     to   Rolland,     the   district      court   failed   to\n\naddress the fundamental issue of whether or not Rolland had an\n\nimpairment.     That issue, however, was undisputed and needed no\n\nelaboration by the district court.           Rolland also suggests that the\n\ndistrict court erroneously limited its analysis to only one prong\n\nof   the   \"disability\"    definition       (whether     Rolland's      impairment\n\nsubstantially limited one or more of his major life activities),\n\naltogether ignoring the other two prongs of the definition (whether\n\nthere was a record of such an impairment and/or whether Rolland was\n\nregarded as having such an impairment).                 Interestingly, Rolland\n\nhimself failed to address the latter two prongs of the definition\n\nbefore the district court.           For that reason alone we decline to\n\nfind error in the district court's failure to specifically analyze\n\neach of the definition's three prongs.                   On appeal, moreover,\n\nRolland makes clear that he again relies on his rehabilitation\n\nposition, and the records supporting his placement in such a\n\nposition, to argue both that he was \"regarded\" as a disabled\n\nemployee and that there was a record of his disability.                        Such\n\nreliance,     directed    to   the   second       and   third    prongs   of     the\n\ndefinition, is just as unpersuasive as the district court found it\n\nto be regarding the first prong of the definition.\n\n            Finally, Rolland maintains that the district court erred\n\nby discounting the evidence—both the medical records and his own\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fdeposition testimony—regarding how his limitations affected his\n\nability to engage in various major life activities.    To be sure,\n\nthe district court said little more than that \"the discovery in\n\nthis case . . . strongly tends to negate, with no substantial\n\ncontradiction, any claim by Plaintiff that he is, in fact, disabled\n\nas the Rehabilitation Act defines that term.\"   Dist. Ct. Order at\n\n3-4.\n\n          Though its explanation was brief, we find that the\n\ndistrict court's assessment of the evidence was not erroneous.\n\nIndeed, the evidence before the district court demonstrated that,\n\ndespite his impairments and to his credit, Rolland is not only able\n\nto perform all of the duties assigned to him during regular work\n\nhours but he is also able to work substantial overtime hours.\n\nWhile the record revealed that he has difficulty bending, stooping,\n\ntwisting, and sitting for extended periods, it also revealed that\n\nhe can mow his yard, vacuum occasionally, load the dishwasher,\n\nwalk, lift up to twenty pounds, blow snow, and do laundry.   Given\n\nthe exacting standard for determining what constitutes a qualifying\n\ndisability under the Rehabilitation Act, and given the limited\n\nnature of the evidence and argument presented to the district court\n\nby Rolland, we agree with the district court that Rolland failed to\n\npresent sufficient evidence of a \"disability\" to survive Potter's\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f                              III.\n\n          For the reasons explained above, we AFFIRM the district\n\ncourt's judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                              -11-\n\f",

Rolland (\"Rolland\"), an employee of the United States Postal Service (\"USPS\"), appeals from the district court's award of summary judgment to John E. Potter (\"Potter\"), Postmaster General of the USPS. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>On March 19, 1994, while working as a forklift driver at the USPS Bulk Mail Center in Springfield, Massachusetts, Rolland suffered an on-the-job injury that resulted in a ruptured intervertebral disc at L4-L5. Following surgery and a period of recovery, Rolland returned to his job as a forklift driver in late June, 1994. Not long thereafter, having continued to experience substantial pain and limitation of movement, Rolland was temporarily reassigned to a light-duty position as a forklift operator's assistant.</p>\n<p>In 1997, following an extensive medical review of Rolland's injury and condition, the USPS offered Rolland a permanent \"rehabilitation position\" as a modified mail handler. Awarded through the USPS's workers' compensation program, a \"rehabilitation position\" is one that the USPS provides to an employee who has permanent restrictions resulting from an on-the-job injury. Rolland accepted the USPS's offer of the rehabilitation position, and he has continued in that \"rehab\" position  the modified mail handler position  since 1997.</p>\n<p>On June 14, 2002, Rolland filed a formal charge of disability discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). Among other things, Rolland alleged that the USPS had discriminated against him in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 701-795, by denying him overtime hours based on his status as a \"rehab\" employee. An EEOC Administrative Judge (\"AJ\") denied Rolland's claim for relief, finding that Rolland failed to establish a cognizable claim under the Rehabilitation Act. On appeal to the EEOC, the AJ's decision was affirmed. Rolland thereafter filed this disability discrimination action in federal district court.</p>\n<p>In his federal complaint, Rolland again asserted a claim under the Rehabilitation Act, alleging that he was a qualified individual with a disability who was denied overtime work on the basis of that disability. Potter sought summary judgment, arguing  among other things  that Rolland was not entitled to relief because he did not have a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. As noted by Potter, Rolland admitted during depositions that he can (1) drive himself to work; (2) lift sacks weighing up to twenty pounds; (3) mow the lawn; (4) prepare meals; (5) do laundry; (6) clear snow with a snow blower; (7) stand for long hours; (8) take extended walks while wearing a knee brace; and (9) perform all of the duties assigned to him as part of his \"rehab\" job. In response to Potter's motion for summary judgment, Rolland argued that, because the USPS had determined that he was disabled for purposes of assigning him to a rehabilitation position, the agency was estopped from arguing otherwise for purposes of Rolland's Rehabilitation Act claim.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> The district court granted Potter's motion for summary judgment, in part finding that Rolland failed to present evidence establishing that he had a disability for purposes of his Rehabilitation Act claim. The district court rejected Rolland's assertion that his eligibility to participate in the USPS's rehabilitation program constituted, by itself, sufficient proof of a qualifying disability. Rolland thereafter filed this timely appeal, raising only one issue: whether the district court erred in finding that Rolland failed to establish that he was disabled for purposes of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant. <i>Gomez-Perez v. Potter,</i> 476 F.3d 54, 56-57 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The Rehabilitation Act provides that \"[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, . . . be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity . . . conducted by . . . the United States Postal Service.\" 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Section 705(20) defines an \"individual with a disability\" as \"any person who . . . has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities\" or \"has a record of such an impairment\" or \"is regarded as having such an impairment.\" <i>Id.</i> § 705(20)(B).</p>\n<p>In <i>Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams,</i> 534 U.S. 184, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002),<sup>[1]</sup> the Supreme Court explained that the phrases \"substantially limits\" and \"major life activities\" must be strictly interpreted \"to create a <i>demanding</i> standard for qualifying as disabled.\" <i>Id.</i> at 197, 122 S.Ct. 681 (emphasis added).<sup>[2]</sup> The Court emphasized that, because the word \"major\" means \"important,\" the phrase \"major life activities\" refers to those activities \"that are of central importance to daily life.\" <i>Id.</i> The Court further emphasized that, because the word \"substantially\" suggests \"considerable\" or \"to a large degree,\" the phrase \"substantially limits\" disqualifies as \"disabilities\" any impairments that interfere in only a minor way with an individual's major life activities. <i>Id.</i> at 196-97, 122 S.Ct. 681. In sum, the Court held that, to qualify as a disabled person under the Rehabilitation Act, an individual must have a permanent or long term impairment \"that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives.\" <i>Id.</i> at 198, 122 S.Ct. 681.</p>\n<p>The determination of whether a plaintiff has a qualifying disability is made on a case-by-case basis. <i>Id.</i> To establish a qualifying disability, the plaintiff has the burden of proving (1) that he or she suffers a physical or mental impairment; (2) that the \"life activity\" limited by the impairment qualifies as \"major;\" and (3) that the limit imposed on the plaintiff's major life activity is substantial. <i>Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,</i> 355 F.3d 6, 20 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Here, Rolland's medical condition is described in the record as including a ruptured L4-L5 disc, sciatica, radiculopathy, and atrophy of both the thigh and calf muscles of his right leg. It is undisputed that he has an impairment. The issue, then, is whether his impairment rises to the level of one that \"substantially limits one or more of . . . [his] major life activities.\"</p>\n<p>Rolland made little effort before the district court to establish that his impairment substantially limits one or more of his major life activities. Instead, citing no authority whatsoever, he argued that his status as a disabled individual was conclusively evidenced by his placement in a USPS rehabilitation position. In essence, he argued that the USPS was estopped from collaterally attacking its own disability determination.</p>\n<p>The Federal Employees Compensation Act (\"FECA\"), 5 U.S.C. §§ 8101-8193, establishes a federal workers' compensation program for employees who suffer a \"disability\" as a result of an on-the-job injury. Eschewing the Rehabilitation Act's more demanding definition of the term \"disability,\" Congress defined the term \"disability\" for workers' compensation purposes as the \"incapacity, because of an employment injury, to earn the wages the employee was receiving at the time of the injury.\" 20 C.F.R. § 10.5(f).</p>\n<p>Among other things, FECA requires federal agencies to place employees in their former positions, or in equivalent positions, following recovery from compensable injuries. 5 U.S.C. § 8151. To fulfill its FECA obligations to employees who suffer compensable injuries, the USPS developed an injury compensation program that specifically addresses the reassignment of employees injured on the job. Under this program, employees whose on-the-job injuries result in permanent restrictions are placed into new rehabilitation positions through the USPS's Rehabilitation Program. To be eligible for participation in the Rehabilitation Program and, thereby, for placement in a rehabilitation position, an employee must \"have a job-related, permanent partial disability documented by medical evidence.\" United States Postal Service Handbook EL-505. The record does not reveal how the USPS defines \"permanent partial disability\" for purposes of its injury compensation program.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> Rolland was found to be eligible for the USPS's Rehabilitation Program because the medical evidence established that he had a job-related \"permanent partial disability.\" Based on the record before it, the district court rejected Rolland's lone and unsupported argument that the USPS's finding of \"disability\" for purposes of its worker's compensation program was the equivalent of a \"disability\" finding for purposes of the Rehabilitation Act. The district court did not err in this regard.</p>\n<p>According to Rolland, the district court failed to address the fundamental issue of whether or not Rolland had an impairment. That issue, however, was undisputed and needed no elaboration by the district court. Rolland also suggests that the district court erroneously limited its analysis to only one prong of the \"disability\" definition (whether Rolland's impairment substantially limited one or more of his major life activities), altogether ignoring the other two prongs of the definition (whether there was a record of such an impairment and/or whether Rolland was regarded as having such an impairment). Interestingly, Rolland himself failed to address the latter two prongs of the definition before the district court. For that reason alone we decline to find error in the district court's failure to specifically analyze each of the definition's three prongs. On appeal, moreover, Rolland makes clear that he again relies on his rehabilitation position, and the records supporting his placement in such a position, to argue both that he was \"regarded\" as a disabled employee and that there was a record of his disability. Such reliance, directed to the second and third prongs of the definition, is just as unpersuasive as the district court found it to be regarding the first prong of the definition.</p>\n<p>Finally, Rolland maintains that the district court erred by discounting the evidence  both the medical records and his own deposition testimony  regarding how his limitations affected his ability to engage in various major life activities. To be sure, the district court said little more than that \"the discovery in this case . . . strongly tends to negate, with no substantial contradiction, any claim by Plaintiff that he is, in fact, disabled as the Rehabilitation Act defines that term.\" Dist. Ct. Order at 3-4.</p>\n<p>Though its explanation was brief, we find that the district court's assessment of the evidence was not erroneous. Indeed, the evidence before the district court demonstrated that, despite his impairments and to his credit, Rolland is not only able to perform all of the duties assigned to him during regular work hours but he is also able to work substantial overtime hours. While the record revealed that he has difficulty bending, stooping, twisting, and sitting for extended periods, it also revealed that he can mow his yard, vacuum occasionally, load the dishwasher, walk, lift up to twenty pounds, blow snow, and do laundry. Given the exacting standard for determining what constitutes a qualifying disability under the Rehabilitation Act, and given the limited nature of the evidence and argument presented to the district court by Rolland, we agree with the district court that Rolland failed to present sufficient evidence of a \"disability\" to survive Potter's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the reasons explained above, we AFFIRM the district court's judgment.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  In <i>Toyota,</i> the plaintiff sued her former employer under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12165, not the Rehabilitation Act.

Rolland (\"Rolland\"), an employee of the United States Postal Service (\"USPS\"), appeals from the district court's award of summary judgment to John E. Potter (\"Potter\"), Postmaster General of the USPS. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>On March 19, 1994, while working as a forklift driver at the USPS Bulk Mail Center in Springfield, Massachusetts, Rolland suffered an on-the-job injury that resulted in a ruptured intervertebral disc at L4-L5. Following surgery and a period of recovery, Rolland returned to his job as a forklift driver in late June, 1994. Not long thereafter, having continued to experience substantial pain and limitation of movement, Rolland was temporarily reassigned to a light-duty position as a forklift operator's assistant.</p>\n<p>In 1997, following an extensive medical review of Rolland's injury and condition, the USPS offered Rolland a permanent \"rehabilitation position\" as a modified mail handler. Awarded through the USPS's workers' compensation program, a \"rehabilitation position\" is one that the USPS provides to an employee who has permanent restrictions resulting from an on-the-job injury. Rolland accepted the USPS's offer of the rehabilitation position, and he has continued in that \"rehab\" position  the modified mail handler position  since 1997.</p>\n<p>On June 14, 2002, Rolland filed a formal charge of disability discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). Among other things, Rolland alleged that the USPS had discriminated against him in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 701-795, by denying him overtime hours based on his status as a \"rehab\" employee. An EEOC Administrative Judge (\"AJ\") denied Rolland's claim for relief, finding that Rolland failed to establish a cognizable claim under the Rehabilitation Act. On appeal to the EEOC, the AJ's decision was affirmed. Rolland thereafter filed this disability discrimination action in federal district court.</p>\n<p>In his federal complaint, Rolland again asserted a claim under the Rehabilitation Act, alleging that he was a qualified individual with a disability who was denied overtime work on the basis of that disability. Potter sought summary judgment, arguing  among other things  that Rolland was not entitled to relief because he did not have a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. As noted by Potter, Rolland admitted during depositions that he can (1) drive himself to work; (2) lift sacks weighing up to twenty pounds; (3) mow the lawn; (4) prepare meals; (5) do laundry; (6) clear snow with a snow blower; (7) stand for long hours; (8) take extended walks while wearing a knee brace; and (9) perform all of the duties assigned to him as part of his \"rehab\" job. In response to Potter's motion for summary judgment, Rolland argued that, because the USPS had determined that he was disabled for purposes of assigning him to a rehabilitation position, the agency was estopped from arguing otherwise for purposes of Rolland's Rehabilitation Act claim.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> The district court granted Potter's motion for summary judgment, in part finding that Rolland failed to present evidence establishing that he had a disability for purposes of his Rehabilitation Act claim. The district court rejected Rolland's assertion that his eligibility to participate in the USPS's rehabilitation program constituted, by itself, sufficient proof of a qualifying disability. Rolland thereafter filed this timely appeal, raising only one issue: whether the district court erred in finding that Rolland failed to establish that he was disabled for purposes of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant. <i>Gomez-Perez v.
