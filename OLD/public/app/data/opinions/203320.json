In 1993, Congress enacted a\n\nstatute regulating the service of homosexual persons in the United\n\nStates military.     10 U.S.C. § 654 (2007)(the Act).     The Act, known\n\nas \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" provides for the separation of members\n\nof the military who engage, attempt to engage, intend to engage, or\n\nhave a propensity to engage in a homosexual act.       Id. § 654(b).    In\n\nthe aftermath of this congressional action, several members of the\n\nmilitary   brought   constitutional    challenges,    claiming    the   Act\n\nviolated the due process and equal protection components of the\n\nFifth Amendment and the free speech clause of the First Amendment.\n\nThese challenges were rejected in other circuits.           See Able v.\n\nUnited States, 155 F.3d 628 (2d Cir. 1998); Holmes v. Cal. Army\n\nNat'l Guard, 124 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 1997); Richenberg v. Perry, 97\n\nF.3d   256 (8th Cir. 1996); Able v. United States, 88 F.3d 1280 (2d\n\nCir. 1996); Thomasson v. Perry, 80 F.3d 915 (4th Cir. 1996) (en\n\nbanc).\n\n           In 2003, the United States Supreme Court invalidated, on\n\nsubstantive due process grounds, two convictions under a Texas law\n\ncriminalizing   sodomy     between    consenting     homosexual   adults.\n\nLawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003). Lawrence has reinvigorated\n\nthe debate over the Act's constitutionality. E.g., Pamela Glazner,\n\nConstitutional Doctrine Meets Reality: Don't Ask, Don't Tell in\n\nLight of Lawrence v. Texas, 46 Santa Clara L. Rev. 635 (2006);\n\nNote, The Military's Ban on Consensual Sodomy in a Post-Lawrence\n\n\n                                 - 3 -\n\fWorld, 21 Wash. U. J. L. & Pol’y 379 (2006); Jeffrey S. Dietz,\n\nGetting Beyond Sodomy: Lawrence and Don't Ask, Don't Tell, 2 Stan.\n\nJ. C. R. & C. L. 63 (2005).     This case is the second post-Lawrence\n\nchallenge to the Act to be decided by a federal court of appeals.1\n\n                 I. Statutory and Regulatory Scheme\n\n           We begin by summarizing the statutory framework and the\n\naccompanying Department of Defense (Department) directives. During\n\nthe 1992 campaign, President Clinton, preceding his first election,\n\npromised   to   revisit   the   longstanding   Department   policy   of\n\nseparating homosexual individuals from military service.         After\n\ntaking office, President Clinton directed the Secretary of Defense\n\nto review Department policy, and Congress undertook its own review.\n\n           As part of the congressional review, then-Chairman of the\n\nJoint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, in testimony explicitly\n\nadopted by the Senate Armed Services Committee, explained the\n\n\n\n\n1\n  The 9th Circuit recently decided Witt v. Dep't of the Air Force,\n2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 10794, at *1 (9th Cir. May 21, 2008). In\nWitt, the plaintiff argued that the Act violated substantive and\nprocedural due process and the Equal Protection Clause. See Id. at\n*1-2. The district court dismissed the suit under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(b)(6). Id. at 2. The 9th Circuit reversed the district court's\nas applied due process rulings, remanding for further proceedings,\nand affirmed the court's dismissal of the plaintiff's Equal\nProtection claim. We agree with much of the reasoning set forth in\nthat opinion but also part ways with the 9th Circuit's approach in\nsome significant respects. Most importantly, for reasons that will\nbecome apparent, we resolve differently the as applied substantive\ndue process claim brought in this case. We also note that the case\nbefore us includes facial challenges to the Act and a First\nAmendment claim.\n\n                                 - 4 -\n\frationale for the policy of separating certain homosexual members\n\nof the military from continued service:\n\n          It is very difficult in a military setting,\n          where you don't get a choice of association,\n          where you don't get a choice of where you live,\n          to introduce a group of individuals who are\n          proud, brave, loyal, good Americans, but who\n          favor a homosexual lifestyle, and put them in\n          with heterosexuals who would prefer not to have\n          somebody of the same sex find them sexually\n          attractive, put them in close proximity and ask\n          them to share the most private facilities\n          together, the bedroom, the barracks, latrines,\n          and showers.    I think that this is a very\n          difficult problem to give the military.       I\n          think it would be prejudicial to good order and\n          discipline to try to integrate that in the\n          current military structure.\n\nS. Rep. No. 103-112 at 283 (1993).\n\n          Congress' review culminated in the passage of the Act.\n\nSee National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Pub.\n\nL. No. 103-160, 107 Stat. 1547 § 571, codified at 10 U.S.C. § 654.\n\nThe Act opens with a series of findings that echo General Powell's\n\nconcerns: \"military life is fundamentally different from civilian\n\nlife;\" \"[s]uccess in combat requires military units that are\n\ncharacterized by high morale, good order and discipline, and unit\n\ncohesion;\" and \"the presence in the armed forces of persons who\n\ndemonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts\n\nwould create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale,\n\ngood order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence\n\nof military capability.\"   See 10 U.S.C. § 654(a).\n\n\n\n                               - 5 -\n\f            To   avoid    the   risk   to    unit    cohesion   created   by   the\n\ncontinued service of those who are likely to engage in a homosexual\n\nact, the Act provides that members of the military are subject to\n\nseparation from service where one of three findings is made:                   (1)\n\nthe member has engaged or attempted to engage in a homosexual act;2\n\n(2) the member has \"state[d] that he or she is a homosexual or\n\nwords to that effect;\" or (3) the member has married or attempted\n\nto marry a person known to be of the same biological sex.                  Id. §\n\n654(b).\n\n            If a finding is made that a member of the military has\n\nengaged or attempted to engage in a homosexual act, the member may\n\navoid separation by establishing that:                 (1) the conduct was a\n\ndeparture from the member's usual and customary behavior; (2) such\n\nconduct is unlikely to recur; (3) such conduct was not accomplished\n\nby   use   of    force,   coercion,     or     intimidation;    (4)    under   the\n\nparticular      circumstances    of    the   case,    the   member's   continued\n\npresence in the military is consistent with the interests of the\n\nmilitary in proper discipline, good order, and morale; and (5) the\n\nmember does not have a propensity or intent to engage in a future\n\nhomosexual act. Id. § 654(b)(1)(A)-(E). Similarly, a member found\n\n\n\n2\n Homosexual act means \"any bodily contact, actively undertaken or\npassively permitted, between members of the same sex for the\npurpose of satisfying sexual desire and any bodily contact which a\nreasonable person would understand to demonstrate a propensity or\nintent to engage in [the homosexual act previously described].\" 10\nU.S.C. § 654 (f)(3).\n\n                                       - 6 -\n\fto have stated, in effect, that he or she is homosexual, may avoid\n\nseparation by demonstrating \"that he or she is not a person who\n\nengages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in,\n\nor intends to engage in a homosexual act.\"             Id. § 654(b)(2).\n\n           Pursuant to authority granted by the Act, the Department\n\nissued   directives       for      executing    separation   proceedings.      The\n\ndirectives recite the three reasons under the Act for separation\n\nand   provide   that     a   member's    statement    that   he   or    she   is   a\n\nhomosexual \"creates a rebuttable presumption that the [member]\n\nengages in, attempts to engage in, intends to engage in, or has a\n\npropensity to engage in a homosexual act.\"             DOD Directive 1332.40\n\n§ E2.3 (1997).        In considering whether a member has rebutted this\n\npresumption, the military considers:              (1) whether the member has\n\nengaged in a homosexual act; (2) the member's credibility; (3)\n\ntestimony from others about the member's past conduct; (4) the\n\nnature and circumstances of the member's statement; and (5) any\n\nother evidence relevant to whether the member is likely to engage\n\nin a homosexual act.         Id.\n\n                II.    The Complaint and Motion to Dismiss\n\n           The plaintiffs are twelve former members of the United\n\nStates military who were separated from service under the Act. The\n\nplaintiffs' complaint asserted the following claims:                   (1) the Act\n\nviolates the plaintiffs' right to substantive due process on its\n\nface and as applied; (2) the Act denies the plaintiffs equal\n\n\n                                        - 7 -\n\fprotection of the law on the basis of sexual orientation; and (3)\n\nthe portion of the Act that triggers separation proceedings based\n\non a member's statement that he or she is homosexual violates the\n\nright to freedom of speech.\n\n          The government moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The government also contended that\n\nthe plaintiffs' due process and equal protection claims failed\n\nbecause the Act was subject only to rational basis review, and\n\nCongress' \"unit cohesion\" justification sufficed to sustain the law\n\nunder this standard as a matter of law.           It also argued that the\n\nevidentiary   use    of    a    member's   statement   that   he   or   she   is\n\nhomosexual to prove that the member has engaged, intends to engage,\n\nor has a propensity to engage in a homosexual act does not abridge\n\nFirst Amendment rights.\n\n                    III.       The District Court Opinion\n\n          The district court began its analysis by dispatching with\n\n     the plaintiffs' as-applied due process challenges.                 Cook v.\n\n     Rumsfeld, 429 F. Supp. 2d 385 (D. Mass. 2006).                 The court\n\n     ruled that, while the complaint asserted that the plaintiffs\n\n     were bringing as-applied challenges, in fact, they pleaded no\n\n     such claims:\n\n          Although the complaint alleges that [the Act]\n          is unconstitutional . . . as it has been\n          particularly   applied    to   each   of   [the\n          plaintiffs], their legal reasoning . . .\n          make[s] it clear that the constitutional\n          defects they perceive inhere in any application\n\n                                 - 8 -\n\f          of the policy to homosexual service members,\n          rather than in the particular way the policy\n          might be (or might have been) applied in\n          specific cases. In other words, none of the\n          plaintiffs claim that the policy, if valid in\n          general, was misapplied in his or her\n          particular case to result in separation when a\n          proper application of the policy would have\n          allowed him or her to remain in service.\n          Rather, their objections . . . are that the\n          policy was applied, not how it was applied.\n          This is classically a facial challenge to the\n          statute, and their arguments will be evaluated\n          with that understanding.\n\nId. at 390 (emphases supplied).\n\n          The district court then turned to the plaintiffs' facial\n\nchallenges, beginning with the due process and equal protection\n\nclaims.   Id. at 391-407.    The court believed that the success of\n\nthese claims hinged primarily on the level of scrutiny that applies\n\nafter Lawrence.   Id. at 393.    The court closely analyzed Lawrence\n\nand determined that the Supreme Court employed rational basis\n\nreview to invalidate the convictions under the Texas law against\n\nhomosexual sodomy.   The court, thus, concluded that Lawrence did\n\nnot alter the applicability of rational basis review, which had\n\nbeen applied in pre-Lawrence challenges to the Act. Id. at 395-96.\n\nThe court then determined, in accord with pre-Lawrence authority,\n\nthat Congress had set forth a rational reason for the statute -- to\n\npromote unit cohesion and discipline -- and therefore the facial\n\ndue process and equal protection claims failed.      Id. at 397-406.\n\n          Finally, the district court rejected the plaintiffs'\n\nFirst Amendment challenge.      Id. at 407-08.   The court noted that\n\n                                 - 9 -\n\fthe Act does not make a member's statement that he or she is a\n\nhomosexual a basis for separation; rather separation is mandated\n\nonly where there has been homosexual conduct or a demonstration of\n\na propensity or intent to engage in such conduct.               Id. at 407.\n\nBased on this understanding, the court concluded that the Act\n\nmerely provides for the \"evidentiary use\" of a member's statement\n\nregarding sexual orientation and that such use does not violate the\n\nFirst Amendment.     Id. at 408.\n\n           Having concluded that all of the plaintiffs' claims\n\nfailed as a matter of law, the district court dismissed the\n\ncomplaint with prejudice and entered a final judgment. Id. at 410.\n\nThe plaintiffs appealed.\n\n                            IV. Standard of Review\n\n           We review a district court's grant of a motion to dismiss\n\nde novo, accepting the complaint's well-pleaded facts as true and\n\nindulging all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.            SFW\n\nArecibo, Ltd. v. Rodriguez, 415 F.3d 135, 138-39 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nTo   survive   a   motion    to   dismiss,   a   complaint   must   allege   a\n\n\"plausible entitlement to relief.\" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 127\n\nS. Ct. 1955, 1967 (2007); Rodriguez-Ortiz v. Margo Caribe, Inc.,\n\n490 F.3d 92, 95 (1st Cir. 2007).             In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6)\n\ndismissal, \"we are not wedded to the [district] court's rationale\n\nand may affirm an order of dismissal on any basis made apparent\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 10 -\n\ffrom the record.\"       McCloskey v. Mueller, 446 F.3d 262, 266 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n                              V. Discussion\n\n           On appeal, the plaintiffs challenge all aspects of the\n\ndistrict court's ruling.          They contend that the district court\n\nincorrectly dismissed their substantive due process and equal\n\nprotection claims because the court misunderstood Lawrence to\n\nmandate a rational basis standard of review, rather than some form\n\nof heightened judicial scrutiny.\n\n           In addition, the plaintiffs dispute the district court's\n\nruling that they did not present as-applied due process and equal\n\nprotection challenges.     Finally, they posit that they sufficiently\n\npleaded a First Amendment challenge to the portion of the Act that\n\ntriggers separation proceeding based on a member's statement of\n\nsexual identity because such a statement is a form of protected\n\nspeech that is punished by the Act.\n\n                             A.    Due Process\n\n           We agree with the parties and the district court that\n\ninterpreting Lawrence is the critical first step in evaluating the\n\nplaintiffs' substantive due process claim.          Prior to Lawrence, the\n\ncourts of appeals, relying on the Supreme Court's holding in Bowers\n\nv. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986) that homosexuals did not possess\n\na   substantive   due    process    interest   in   engaging   in   sodomy,\n\nconsidered due process challenges to the Act under rational basis\n\n\n                                    - 11 -\n\freview.3   See, e.g., Richenberg, 97 F.3d at 260-61; Thomasson, 80\n\nF.3d at 928.     But Lawrence overruled Bowers, so the post-Lawrence\n\nstandard for reviewing a substantive due process challenge to the\n\nAct is unclear.    Before addressing the district court's conclusion\n\nthat the rational basis standard continues to apply, we review\n\nbasic substantive due process principles.\n\n           It has long been held that, despite their name, the due\n\nprocess clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments \"guarantee[]\n\nmore than fair process.\"         Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65\n\n(2000).    The    substantive    component     of   due   process   \"provides\n\nheightened protection against government interference with certain\n\nfundamental    rights   and     liberty     interests.\"      Washington    v.\n\nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720 (1997).\n\n           The Supreme Court acts with \"caution and restraint\" when\n\nclassifying a particular liberty interest as triggering substantive\n\ndue process protection, Moore v. City of E. Cleveland, 431 U.S.\n\n494, 502 (1977), because classifying an interest as protected by\n\ndue process to a \"great extent, place[s a] matter outside the arena\n\nof public debate and legislative action.\"           Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at\n\n720.   The Court has recognized that the \"Nation's history, legal\n\n\n\n3\n Where no protected liberty interest is implicated, substantive due\nprocess challenges are reviewed under the rational basis standard.\nSee Medeiros v. Vincent, 431 F.3d 25, 33 (1st Cir. 2005). Under\nthis standard, a statute passes constitutional muster so long as\nthe law is rationally related to a legitimate governmental\ninterest. Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 320 (1993).\n\n                                   - 12 -\n\ftradition,   and    practices   provide    the   crucial   guideposts   for\n\nresponsible decisionmaking\" in this area.         Id. at 721.    But it has\n\nalso recognized that while \"history and tradition are the starting\n\npoint,\" they are \"not in all cases the ending point of the\n\nsubstantive due process inquiry.\"         Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 572.\n\n          In Glucksberg, the Supreme Court catalogued the following\n\n\"liberty interests\" as \"specially protected\" by the due process\n\nclause:   the right to marry; to have children; to direct the\n\neducation of one's children; to enjoy marital privacy; to use\n\ncontraception; to maintain bodily integrity; to choose to have an\n\nabortion; and to refuse unwanted medical treatment.             Glucksberg,\n\n521 U.S. at 720.      The question here is whether Lawrence added to\n\nthis list an adult's right \"to engage in consensual sexual intimacy\n\nin the home.\"      Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 567.\n\n          In Lawrence, the Court considered a substantive due\n\nprocess challenge to two criminal convictions under a Texas statute\n\ncriminalizing homosexual sodomy. Id. at 564. The petitioners were\n\ntwo males who had been arrested for engaging in a sexual act in one\n\nof their apartments.      Id. at 563.     The statute at issue provided\n\nthat a \"person commits an offense if he engages in deviate sexual\n\nintercourse with another individual of the same sex.\"4            Id.   The\n\n\n4\n The statute defined deviate sexual conduct as \"any contact        between\nany part of the genitals of one person and the mouth or            anus of\nanother person; or the penetration of the genitals or the          anus of\nanother person with an object.\"         Tex. Penal Code            Ann. §\n21.01(1)(2007).\n\n                                 - 13 -\n\fLawrence    Court   characterized   the   constitutional   question   as\n\n\"whether petitioners' criminal convictions for adult consensual\n\nsexual intimacy in the home violate their vital interests in\n\nliberty and privacy protected by the Due Process Clause.\"       Id. at\n\n564.\n\n            Lawrence addressed this question by considering a line of\n\nSupreme Court authority recognizing various due process rights that\n\nprotect the formation and perpetuation of intimate relationships.\n\nId. at 564.    It identified Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479\n\n(1965), as the \"pertinent beginning point.\"      Griswold invalidated\n\na law banning the use of contraceptives by married couples because\n\nthere is due process protection for the realm of privacy implicit\n\nin the marital relationship and bedroom.        Lawrence, 539 U.S. at\n\n564-65.    From there, Lawrence discussed later cases that broadened\n\nthe interest recognized in Griswold, including Eisenstadt v. Baird,\n\n405 U.S. 438 (1972), which invalidated a ban on contraception use\n\nby unmarried people; Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), which\n\ninvalidated a law restricting a woman's right to abort a pregnancy;\n\nand Carey v. Population Servs. Int'l, 431 U.S. 678 (1977), which\n\nstruck down a prohibition on the sale of contraception to persons\n\nunder sixteen years of age.    Relying on these precedents, Lawrence\n\nconcluded that Supreme Court substantive due process precedent\n\nestablishes protection for \"certain decisions regarding sexual\n\n\n\n\n                                - 14 -\n\fconduct   [that]   extend[]     beyond   the   martial   relationship.\"\n\nLawrence, 539 U.S. at 565.\n\n           Lawrence used these precedents as the launching point for\n\nits critique of Bowers.        In Bowers, the Court rejected a due\n\nprocess   challenge   to   a   Georgia   statute   similar   to   the   one\n\nchallenged in Lawrence.        Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 566.         Lawrence\n\ncriticized Bowers for focusing too narrowly on the \"right of\n\nhomosexuals to engage in sodomy\" rather than on the broader right\n\nof adults to engage in private, consensual sexual intimacy:\n\n           To say that the issue in Bowers was simply the\n           right to engage in certain sexual conduct\n           demeans the claim the individual [in Bowers]\n           put forward, just as it would demean a married\n           couple were it to be said that marriage is\n           simply about the right to have sexual\n           intercourse. The laws involved in Bowers and\n           here are, to be sure, statutes that purport to\n           do no more than prohibit a particular sexual\n           act.   Their penalties and purposes, though,\n           have more far-reaching consequences, touching\n           upon the most private human conduct, sexual\n           behavior, and in the most private of places,\n           the home. The statutes do seek to control a\n           personal relationship that whether or not\n           entitled to formal recognition in law, is\n           within the liberty of persons to choose . . .\n\nId. at 566-67.\n\n           After identifying this analytical flaw in Bowers, the\n\nLawrence Court observed:\n\n           [A]dults may choose to enter [into personal\n           relationships] in the confines of their homes\n           and their own private lives and still retain\n           their dignity as free persons. When sexuality\n           finds overt expression in intimate conduct with\n\n\n                           - 15 -\n\f            another person, the conduct can be but one\n            element in a personal bond that is more\n            enduring.   The liberty protected by   the\n            Constitution allows homosexual persons the\n            right to make this choice.\n\nId. at 567.\n\n            Placing the final nail in Bowers' coffin, the Lawrence\n\nCourt quoted from Justice Stevens' Bowers dissent that \"'individual\n\ndecisions by married persons, concerning the intimacies of their\n\nphysical relationship, even when not intended to produce offspring,\n\nare   a   form   of   liberty   protected    by   the   Due   Process       Clause.\n\nMoreover, this protection extends to intimate choices by unmarried\n\nas well as married persons.'\"        Id. at 578 (quoting Bowers, 478 U.S.\n\nat 216 (Stevens, J., dissenting)).          In formally overruling Bowers,\n\nthe Court stated that \"Justice Stevens' analysis . . . should have\n\nbeen controlling in Bowers and should control here.\"                  Id.\n\n            Having    dispatched    with    Bowers,     the   Court    turned    to\n\nanalyze the constitutionality of the convictions under the Texas\n\nstatute:\n\n            The present case does not involve minors. It\n            does not involve persons who might be injured\n            or coerced or who are situated in relationships\n            where consent might not easily be refused. It\n            does   not    involve    public    conduct   or\n            prostitution. It does not involve whether the\n            government must give formal recognition to any\n            relationship that homosexual persons seek to\n            enter. The case does involve two adults who,\n            with full and mutual consent from each other,\n            engaged in sexual practices common to a\n            homosexual lifestyle.     The petitioners are\n            entitled to respect for their private lives.\n            The State cannot demean their existence or\n\n                                - 16 -\n\f             control their destiny by making their private\n             sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty\n             under the Due Process Clause gives them the\n             full right to engage in their conduct without\n             intervention from government. \"It is a promise\n             of the Constitution that there is a realm of\n             personal liberty which the government may not\n             enter.\"     The Texas statute furthers no\n             legitimate state interest which can justify\n             its intrusion into the personal and private\n             life of the individual.\n\nId. (quoting Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505\n\nU.S. 833, 847 (1992)).\n\n             Courts and commentators interpreting Lawrence diverge\n\nover the doctrinal approach employed to invalidate the petitioners'\n\nconvictions.     Some have read Lawrence to apply a rational basis\n\napproach.5    Others see the case as applying strict scrutiny.6   And\n\n\n5\n Sylvester v.

Hunter, Living with Lawrence, 88\n\nMinn. L. Rev. 1103 (2004).      But we are persuaded that Lawrence did\n\nindeed recognize a protected liberty interest for adults to engage\n\nin private, consensual sexual intimacy and applied a balancing of\n\nconstitutional interests that defies either the strict scrutiny or\n\nrational basis label.\n\n            There are at least four reasons for reading Lawrence as\n\nrecognizing a protected liberty interest.         First, Lawrence relies\n\non   the   following   due   process   cases    for   doctrinal    support:\n\nGriswold, Eisentstadt, Roe, Carey, and Casey.         539 U.S. at 565-66.\n\nEach case resulted in the Supreme Court recognizing a due process\n\nright to make personal decisions related to sexual conduct that\n\nmandated the application of heightened judicial scrutiny.              Id.   It\n\nwould be strange indeed to interpret Lawrence as not recognizing a\n\n\n\nHarv. L. Rev. 1893, 1917 (2004).\n7\n United States v. Marcum, 60 M.J. 198 (U.S. Armed Forces 2004);\nNancy C.

Beschle,\nLawrence Beyond Gay Rights: Taking the Rationality Requirement for\nJustifying Criminal Statutes Seriously, 53 Drake L. Rev. 231, 276\n(2005).\n\n                                  - 18 -\n\fprotected liberty interest when virtually every case it relied upon\n\nfor support recognized such an interest.\n\n             Second,    the   language      employed    throughout        Lawrence\n\nsupports the recognition of a protected liberty interest. Lawrence\n\nassociated the right at issue with the core constitutional rights\n\nof \"freedom of thought, belief, and expression,\" rights which\n\nundoubtedly mandate special protection under the Constitution. Id.\n\nat 563.    It also stated that \"liberty gives substantial protection\n\nto adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in\n\nmatters pertaining to sex.\"        Id. at 572 (emphasis supplied).              And\n\nit concluded its analysis by stating that the \"right to liberty\n\nunder the Due Process Clause\" allowed the petitioners to engage in\n\n\"private    sexual     conduct\"   because    \"'[i]t    is   a   promise    of   the\n\nConstitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the\n\ngovernment may not enter.'\"        Id. at 578 (quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at\n\n847).     Such language strongly suggests that Lawrence identified a\n\nprotected liberty interest.\n\n             Third, in overruling Bowers, Lawrence relied on Justice\n\nStevens' Bowers dissent as stating the controlling principles. Id.\n\nat 578. The passage of Justice Stevens' dissent quoted in Lawrence\n\nstated that \"individual decisions by married persons, concerning\n\nthe intimacies of their physical relationship, even when not\n\nintended to produce offspring, are a form of liberty protected by\n\nthe Due Process Clause . . . . Moreover, this protection extends to\n\n\n                                    - 19 -\n\fintimate choices by unmarried as well as married persons.\"             Id.\n\nIn support of this proposition, Justice Stevens cited Griswold,\n\nEisenstadt and Carey.        Bowers, 478 U.S. at 216 (Stevens, J.,\n\ndissenting).   As discussed above, these are due process cases that\n\nrecognize protected liberty interests.          Furthermore, in the very\n\nnext passage of Justice Stevens' dissent, he described these cases\n\nas establishing rights that are \"fundamental\" and placed the right\n\nof adults to engage in private intimate conduct in the same\n\ncategory.   Id.    It is impossible to read Lawrence as declining to\n\nrecognize a protected liberty interest without ignoring the Court's\n\nstatement that Justice Stevens' Bowers dissent was controlling.\n\n            Finally, if Lawrence had applied traditional rational\n\nbasis review (the appropriate standard if no protected liberty\n\ninterest was at stake, see e.g., Medeiros, 431 F.3d at 33), the\n\nconvictions under the Texas statute would have been sustained. The\n\ngovernmental interest in prohibiting immoral conduct was the only\n\nstate   interest   that    Texas     offered   to   justify   the   statute.\n\nLawrence, 539 U.S. at         582.      It is well established that a\n\n\"legislature [can] legitimately act . . . to protect the societal\n\ninterest in order and morality.\" Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501\n\nU.S. 560, 569 (1991) (quoting Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413\n\nU.S. 49, 61 (1973)).      Thus, Lawrence's holding can only be squared\n\nwith the Supreme Court's acknowledgment of morality as a rational\n\nbasis by concluding that a protected liberty interest was at stake,\n\n\n                                   - 20 -\n\fand therefore a rational basis for the law was not sufficient.\n\n            Taking into account the precedent relied on by Lawrence,\n\nthe tenor of its language, its special reliance on Justice Stevens'\n\nBowers dissent, and its rejection of morality as an adequate basis\n\nfor the law in question, we are convinced that Lawrence recognized\n\nthat adults maintain a protected liberty interest to engage in\n\ncertain \"consensual sexual intimacy in the home.\"           The district\n\ncourt, relying on cases from other circuits, read Lawrence as\n\napplying rational basis review.          We, however, do not find any of\n\nthe four primary reasons supporting this view persuasive. See Muth\n\nv. Frank, 412 F.3d 808, 817-18 (7th Cir. 2005); Lofton v. Sec'y of\n\nthe Dep't of Children & Family Servs., 358 F.3d 804, 815-17 (11th\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n            First, the argument has been made that Lawrence nowhere\n\nexplicitly stated that the right at issue was \"fundamental\" and\n\ntherefore the opinion cannot be read as recognizing a fundamental\n\nright under the due process clause.         See Cook, 429 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n394.      While it is true that Lawrence nowhere used the word\n\n\"fundamental\" to describe the interest at stake, there are several\n\nSupreme    Court   cases   that   have    recognized   protected   liberty\n\ninterests without using this word.         For example, in Washington v.\n\nHarper, 494 U.S. 210, 223 (1990), the Supreme Court held that a\n\nstate prisoner \"retains a significant liberty interest\" under the\n\ndue process clause to avoid the unwanted administration of certain\n\n\n                                  - 21 -\n\fdrugs.    And in Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 600 (1979), the Court\n\ndescribed a child's \"substantial liberty interest\" in not being\n\nconfined unnecessarily for medical treatment.            See also Casey, 505\n\nU.S. at 851 (describing the interest as a \"protected liberty\");\n\nCruzan v. Director of Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 278 (1990)\n\n(describing the interest as a \"constitutionally protected liberty\n\ninterest\");     Youngberg   v.    Romeo,    457   U.S.    307,   315   (1982)\n\n(describing the interests as \"liberty interests\").               It is thus\n\nclear    that   the   Supreme   Court   does   not   always   use   the   word\n\n\"fundamental\" when it wishes to identify an interest protected by\n\nsubstantive due process.\n\n            Second, it has been maintained that Lawrence could not\n\nhave identified a protected liberty interest because the Supreme\n\nCourt did not engage in a thorough analysis of the \"Nation's\n\nhistory and tradition\" as required under Glucksberg.                Muth, 412\n\nF.3d at 817;     Williams, 378 F.3d at 1236; Lofton, 358 F.3d at 816-\n\n17.   This argument is based on the mistaken premise that the only\n\nhistory relevant to the substantive due process inquiry is a\n\nhistory demonstrating affirmative government action to protect the\n\nright in question.        But Glucksberg does not establish such a\n\nrequirement.     Lawrence engaged in a thorough historical analysis\n\nidentifying the lack of a long history of government action to\n\npunish the private consensual, intimate conduct of homosexuals.\n\nThis sort of historical analysis is not inconsistent with Supreme\n\n\n                                   - 22 -\n\fCourt precedent in this area.          Indeed, if affirmative government\n\naction protecting a right were required to trigger substantive due\n\nprocess   protection,    at   least    some   of    the   due     process   cases\n\nrecognizing a liberty interest would have come out differently\n\nbecause there was no established history of government protection\n\nfor the right to have an abortion or to use contraception.                   See\n\nRoe, 410 U.S. at 132-41 (reviewing history of abortion law to show\n\nthat laws restricting abortion are of recent vintage but not\n\nshowing any history of affirmative government action to protect the\n\nright to an abortion); see also Williams, 378 F.3d at 1258-59.\n\n           Moreover, to the extent that Lawrence did not adhere to\n\nthe   Glucksberg   approach     of    locating     the    right    to   private,\n\nconsensual adult intimacy in the Nation's history and tradition, it\n\nexplicitly   disavowed    the   exclusivity        of   this    approach.    See\n\nLawrence, 539 U.S. at 572 (\"history and tradition are the starting\n\nbut not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due\n\nprocess inquiry.\").      In this regard, the Lawrence Court stated:\n\n           [W]e think that our laws and traditions in the\n           past half century are of most relevance here.\n           These references show an emerging awareness\n           that liberty gives substantial protection to\n           adult persons in deciding how to conduct their\n           private lives in matters pertaining to sex.\n\nId. at 571-72.     Thus, Lawrence recognized that, in at least some\n\ncircumstances, the consideration of recent trends and practices is\n\nrelevant to defining the scope of protected liberty.\n\n           Third, it has been suggested that the Lawrence majority's\n\n                                     - 23 -\n\frefusal to respond to Justice Scalia's Lawrence dissent, in which\n\nhe argued that the majority had not recognized a protected liberty\n\ninterest, indicates that the majority agreed with the dissent's\n\nanalysis.    See Sylvester v. Fogley, 465 F.3d 851, 858 (8th Cir.\n\n2006).   The district court relied heavily on this point, observing\n\nthat \"it might be expected that if [Justice Scalia's dissent]\n\nwrongly characterized a principal holding of the case, the majority\n\nwould have answered and corrected it.\"           Cook, 429 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n394.\n\n            This   is   a   possible   explanation   for   the   majority's\n\nsilence, but it is not the only explanation.               It is equally\n\npossible that the Lawrence majority believed that the text of its\n\nopinion stood for itself and that there was little to be gained by\n\ndebating Justice Scalia on this point.           Cf. Cent. Bank of Denver\n\nN.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver N.A., 511 U.S. 164, 187\n\n(1994)   (\"Congressional      inaction   lacks   persuasive   significance\n\nbecause several equally tenable inferences may be drawn from such\n\ninaction. . . .\").      Given the equally possible, but conflicting,\n\ninferences that can be drawn from the majority's lack of response\n\nto Justice Scalia's dissent, we think that there is little to be\n\ngleaned about Lawrence's meaning from it.\n\n            Finally, it has been claimed that Lawrence's conclusion\n\nthat \"[t]he Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest\n\nwhich can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life\n\n\n                                  - 24 -\n\fof the individual\" indicates that Lawrence did not recognize a\n\nprotected liberty interest.        Sylvester, 465 F.3d at 857; Muth, 412\n\nF.3d at 818; Lofton, 358 F.3d at 817 (emphasis supplied).                       This\n\nargument is premised on the notion that the words \"legitimate state\n\ninterest\" indicate the application of rational basis review, which\n\nis not the proper standard where a protected liberty interest is\n\nimplicated.     As the district court stated, \"[t]he use of the\n\nappropriate adjective is telltale to constitutional lawyers.                      If\n\nthe Lawrence court had been evaluating the constitutionality of the\n\nTexas statute under the more exacting standard where fundamental\n\ninterests are at stake, it would instead have asked whether the\n\nstate   interest      was   compelling,     rather    than      whether    it    was\n\nlegitimate.\"    Cook, 429 F. Supp. 2d at        395.\n\n           We take a different view.         A law survives rational basis\n\nreview so long as the law is rationally related to a legitimate\n\ngovernmental interest. E.g., Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 11-12\n\n(1992). Rational basis review does not permit consideration of the\n\nstrength   of   the    individual's    interest      or   the    extent    of    the\n\nintrusion on that interest caused by the law; the focus is entirely\n\non the rationality of the state's reason for enacting the law.                   See\n\nHeller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 324 (1993) (a law \"fails rational-\n\nbasis review\" only when it \"rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to\n\nthe   achievement      of   the   State's    objectives\"        or   the   State's\n\nobjectives are themselves invalid).               Thus, the argument that\n\n\n                                    - 25 -\n\fLawrence did not recognize a protected liberty interest because it\n\nused the words \"legitimate state interest\" divorces these word from\n\ncontext -- a context which shows that Lawrence did not employ\n\ntraditional   rational   basis      review   since   the   Lawrence   Court's\n\nanalysis focused on the individual's liberty interest.             This view\n\nis supported by Supreme Court cases that have recognized protected\n\nliberty interests in the face of \"legitimate state interests.\"\n\nCasey, 505 U.S. at 853 (recognizing that even though protected\n\nliberty interest was at stake, \"the separate States could act in\n\nsome degree to further their own legitimate interests in protecting\n\nprenatal life\"); Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 425-26 (1979)\n\n(balancing the \"individual's interest in not being involuntarily\n\nconfined indefinitely\" against the state's \"legitimate interest\n\nunder its parens patriae powers in providing care to its citizens\n\nwho   are   unable   because   of    emotional   disorders    to   care   for\n\nthemselves\").\n\n            To say, as we do, that Lawrence recognized a protected\n\nliberty interest for adults to engage in consensual sexual intimacy\n\nin the home does not mean that the Court applied strict scrutiny to\n\ninvalidate the convictions.         Several pre-Lawrence cases that have\n\nrecognized protected liberty interests did not mandate that the\n\nchallenged law be \"narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state\n\ninterest\" -- the strict scrutiny standard. For example, in Sell v.\n\nUnited States, 539 U.S. 166, 179 (2003), the Court recognized a\n\n\n                                    - 26 -\n\f\"constitutionally   protected   liberty   interest    [for   a   criminal\n\ndefendant] in avoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychotic\n\ndrugs\" and then applied a standard of review less demanding than\n\nstrict scrutiny by asking whether administering the drugs was\n\n\"necessary significantly to further important governmental trial-\n\nrelated interests.\"   And similarly, in Casey, 505 U.S. at 877, the\n\nSupreme Court reaffirmed a woman's fundamental right to choose to\n\nhave an abortion but applied the \"undue burden\" test which balanced\n\nthe state's legitimate interest in potential human life against the\n\nextent of the imposition on the woman's liberty interest. See also\n\nTroxel, 530 U.S. at 67-75 (invalidating law burdening due process\n\ninterest in parental autonomy without applying either rational\n\nbasis or strict scrutiny); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135-36\n\n(1990) (balancing an individual's interest in refusing psychotropic\n\ndrugs against the government's interest in trying a competent\n\ncriminal defendant for a violent crime); Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 278-79\n\n(balancing   \"protected   liberty   interest\"   in   refusing    unwanted\n\nmedical treatment against the government interest in promoting\n\nlife); Harper, 494 U.S. at 223 (weighing a prisoner's interest in\n\nrefusing drugs against the government's interest in promoting a\n\nsafe prison environment); Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 320-22 (balancing\n\nliberty interest of an individual to avoid bodily restraint against\n\nthe State's asserted reason for the restraint).\n\n          Lawrence is, in our view, another in this line of Supreme\n\n\n                                - 27 -\n\fCourt authority that identifies a protected liberty interest and\n\nthen applies a standard of review that lies between strict scrutiny\n\nand rational basis.   In invalidating the convictions, the Lawrence\n\nCourt determined that there was no legitimate state interest that\n\nwas adequate to \"justify\" the intrusion on liberty worked by the\n\nlaw.   539 U.S. at 578.    In other words, Lawrence balanced the\n\nstrength of the state's asserted interest in prohibiting immoral\n\nconduct against the degree of intrusion into the petitioners'\n\nprivate sexual life caused by the statute in order to determine\n\nwhether the law was unconstitutionally applied.      See Casey, 505\n\nU.S. at 873 (\"[N]ot every law which makes a right more difficult to\n\nexercise is, ipso facto, an infringement of that right.\").\n\n           Having defined the nature of the constitutional review\n\nmandated by Lawrence, we now consider whether the plaintiffs'\n\nfacial due process challenge to the Act can survive a motion to\n\ndismiss.\n\n           \"A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course,\n\nthe most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the\n\nchallenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under\n\nwhich the Act would be valid.   The fact that [an Act] might operate\n\nunconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is\n\ninsufficient to render it wholly invalid . . . .\"     United States\n\nv. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987); see also Comfort v. Lynn Sch.\n\nComm., 418 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2005) (en banc).   The Supreme Court\n\n\n                                - 28 -\n\fhas recently emphasized the limits on facial challenges in the\n\nsubstantive due process context.         See Gonzales v. Carhart, 127 S.\n\nCt. 1610, 1639 (2007).\n\n            The plaintiffs' facial challenge fails. Lawrence did not\n\nidentify a protected liberty interest in all forms and manner of\n\nsexual intimacy.        Lawrence recognized only a narrowly defined\n\nliberty    interest    in   adult    consensual    sexual    intimacy    in   the\n\nconfines of one's home and one's own private life.              Lawrence, 539\n\nU.S. at 567.     The Court made it abundantly clear that there are\n\nmany types of sexual activity that are beyond the reach of that\n\nopinion.    Id., at 578.     Here, the Act includes such other types of\n\nsexual activity.      The Act provides for the separation of a service\n\nperson who engages in a public homosexual act or who coerces\n\nanother person to engage in a homosexual act.            Both of these forms\n\nof   conduct   are    expressly     excluded    from   the   liberty    interest\n\nrecognized by Lawrence.       Id.\n\n            The plaintiffs' as-applied challenge, on the other hand,\n\npresents a more difficult question.            The plaintiffs point out that\n\nthe Act could apply to some conduct that falls within the zone of\n\nprotected liberty identified by Lawrence.              The Act, for example,\n\ncould cover homosexual conduct occurring off base between two\n\nconsenting adults in the privacy of their home.8\n\n\n8\n The district court did not reach the merits of the plaintiffs' as-\napplied due process challenge to the Act.       It concluded that,\nalthough the plaintiffs tried to plead as-applied challenges, the\n\n                                     - 29 -\n\f           Before addressing the significance of this observation,\n\nwe pause to recognize the unique context in which the liberty\n\ninterest at stake in this case arises.                  We are reviewing an\n\nexercise of Congressional judgment in the area of military affairs.\n\nThe   deferential   approach     courts   take   when    doing   so     is   well-\n\nestablished.     Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748, 768 (1996)\n\n(noting   that   the   Supreme    Court   gives   Congress       \"the    highest\n\ndeference\" in ordering military affairs) (citation omitted); Weiss\n\nv. United States, 510 U.S. 163, 177 (1994) (recognizing that the\n\nSupreme Court \"[adheres] to [the] principle of deference in a\n\nvariety of contexts [such as] where the constitutional rights of\n\n\ncomplaint failed to identify facts showing that the Act was\n\"misapplied\" in certain cases. We view differently the necessary\nfactual predicate for an as-applied constitutional challenge to the\nAct. A claim that the Act was \"misapplied\" in a particular case is\nactionable, if at all, under the Administrative Procedures Act.\nSee Richenberg v. Perry, 97 F.3d 256, 263 (8th Cir. 1996) (assuming\nthat a review of separation decision under the Act is reviewable\nunder the APA).    But this is not the plaintiffs' claim.       The\nplaintiffs allege that, even though the Act was properly\nadministered according to its terms to separate each of them from\nservice, the Act cannot be constitutionally applied in their\nparticular cases because the application unconstitutionally\ninfringes on their Lawrence interest. As-applied challenges \"'are\nthe basic building blocks of constitutional adjudication'\" because\nthey relieve the court of having \"to consider every conceivable\nsituation which might possibly arise in the application of complex\nand comprehensive legislation.\" Carhart, 127 S. Ct. at 1639. A\nplaintiff asserts an as-applied challenge by claiming that a\nstatute is unconstitutional as-applied to his or her particular\nconduct, even though the statute may be valid as to other parties.\nSee Daggett v. Comm'n of Gov. Ethics & Election Practices, 205 F.3d\n445, 472 (1st Cir. 2000). The plaintiffs have pleaded classic as-\napplied challenges here because they claim that the Act is\nunconstitutional as applied to them, even though the Act may be\nconstitutional as applied to others.\n\n                                   - 30 -\n\fservicemen [are] implicated\"); Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57, 70\n\n(1981)   (\"[J]udicial       deference   .    .   .    is   at    its   apogee     when\n\nlegislative action under the congressional authority to raise and\n\nsupport armies and make rules and regulations for their governance\n\nis challenged.\").\n\n            The Supreme Court has articulated essentially two reasons\n\nfor this deference.         The first involves institutional competence.\n\nThe Court has remarked:\n\n            It is difficult to conceive of an area of\n            governmental activity in which courts have\n            less competence.    The complex, subtle, and\n            professional decisions as to the composition,\n            training, equipping and control of a military\n            force are essentially professional military\n            judgments, subject always to civilian control\n            of the Legislative and Executive Branches.\n\nGilligan v. Morgan, 413 U.S. 1, 10 (1973); see also N.D. v. United\n\nStates, 495 U.S. 423, 443 (1990) (noting that where confronted with\n\nquestions relating to military operations the Court \"properly\n\ndefer[s] to the judgment of those who must lead our Armed Forces in\n\nbattle\").\n\n            The    second    relates    to   the     constitutional         power   of\n\nCongress    to    \"raise    and   support    armies    and      to   make   all   laws\n\nnecessary and proper to that end.\"            United States v. O'Brien, 391\n\nU.S. 367, 377 (1968).        The Court has described this power as \"broad\n\nand sweeping,\" id., and has further noted Congress' accompanying\n\nresponsibility for \"the delicate task of balancing the rights of\n\nservicemen against the needs of the military.\"                   Solorio v. United\n\n                                     - 31 -\n\fStates, 488 U.S. 435, 447 (1987).\n\n            It    is      unquestionable       that     judicial   deference   to\n\ncongressional decision-making in the area of military affairs\n\nheavily influences the analysis and resolution of constitutional\n\nchallenges that arise in this context.                The Court's examination of\n\nthe equal protection challenge leveled in Rostker provides an\n\nexample. That case concerned a statute that required only males to\n\nregister for selective service.               The lower court had invalidated\n\nthe statute as unlawful gender discrimination.                 453 U.S. at 63.\n\nIn reversing, the Court focused its analysis entirely on the\n\nlegislative      record    that   led    to   Congress'    action.    The   Court\n\ndiscussed, in detail, the process Congress employed in considering\n\nthe issue, its consultation with all interested parties, its\n\nserious consideration of the issues, including the constitutional\n\nimplications, and its clear articulation of the basis for its\n\ndecision.     Id. at 72-80.        The Court then declared the district\n\ncourt's analysis striking down the law \"quite wrong\" because the\n\ndistrict court undertook \"an independent evaluation of evidence\n\nrather than adopting an appropriately deferential examination of\n\nCongress' evaluation of the evidence.\" Id. at 82-83.\n\n            The Court's treatment of First Amendment and Due Process\n\nchallenges brought in this area similarly manifests this deference\n\nto congressional judgment. In Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733 (1974),\n\na case involving vagueness and overbreadth challenges to provisions\n\n\n                                        - 32 -\n\fof the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the Court stated that\n\n\"Congress is permitted to legislate both with greater breadth and\n\nwith    greater   flexibility   when   the   statute   governs   military\n\nsociety.\"   Id. at 755.   In Weiss, the Court reemphasized that when\n\ndealing with due process challenges \"the tests and limitations\n\n[associated with those challenges] may differ because of the\n\nmilitary context.\"     510 U.S. at 177 (citing Rostker, 453 U.S. at\n\n67).9\n\n            Fully apprised of the constraints on our constitutional\n\ninquiry when considering constitutional challenges in the military\n\ncontext, we now examine both the process by which Congress passed\n\nthe Act and the rationale Congress advanced for it.\n\n            Congress' process for developing the Act was involved and\n\nit included sustained consideration of the Act's necessity and its\n\nimpact on constitutional rights.          After President Clinton was\n\ninaugurated, he directed the Secretary of Defense to submit a draft\n\nExecutive Order \"ending discrimination on the basis of sexual\n\norientation in determining who may serve in the Armed Services.\"\n\nMemorandum on Ending Discrimination in the Armed Forces, 1 Pub.\n\n\n\n9\n Other examples of the deferential approach the Court has taken\nwhen analyzing constitutional challenges in the military context\ninclude: Goldman v. Weinberger, 475 U.S. 503, 508 (1986) (free\nexercise of religion); Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U.S. 296, 300-05\n(1983) (racial discrimination); Brown v. Glines, 444 U.S. 348, 357-\n60 (1980) (free expression); Middendorf v. Henry, 425 U.S. 25, 43\n(1976) (right to counsel in summary court-martial proceeding).\nSolorio, 483 U.S. at 448 (collecting cases).\n\n                                 - 33 -\n\fPapers 23 (Jan. 29, 1993).        The President instructed the Secretary\n\nto consult with the military's professional leadership and others\n\nconcerned with the issue.         Id.   While this review was in progress,\n\nan interim policy was imposed that ended the practice of asking new\n\nrecruits to confirm that they were heterosexual.\n\n           Congress quickly intervened. A few weeks after President\n\nClinton was sworn in, Congress passed a provision calling for a\n\nreview of the military's approach to homosexuals serving in the\n\nmilitary by the Secretary of Defense and the Senate Armed Services\n\nCommittee.     See Pub. L. 103-3 § 601, 107 Stat. 6, 28-29 (1993).\n\n           Subsequently, the Department and congressional committees\n\nengaged in an exhaustive policy review. The Senate and House Armed\n\nServices Committees conducted fourteen days of hearings, heard more\n\nthan fifty witnesses, and traveled to military facilities to\n\ninvestigate the issue.      The Committees heard from witnesses with a\n\nwide   range   of   views   and    various   backgrounds,   including   the\n\nSecretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\nmilitary and legal experts, enlisted personnel, officers, and\n\npublic policy activists.      See Assessment of the Plan to Lift the\n\nBan on Homosexuals in the Military:          Hearings Before the Military\n\nForces and Personnel Subcomm. of the House Comm. on Armed Services,\n\n103 Cong., 1st Sess.

(1993).\n\n           While    this     congressional    review   was    ongoing,     the\n\nDepartment conducted its own review.            The Department convened a\n\nmilitary working group comprised of senior officers, commissioned\n\na RAND Corporation study, studied the history of the military's\n\nresponse to social change, and consulted legal experts.\n\n           In July 1993, President Clinton announced a new policy\n\nfor the service of homosexuals in the military.         Under the policy,\n\napplicants for military service would not be asked their sexual\n\norientation but, once inducted into service, a member could be\n\nseparated for homosexual conduct.           1 Pub. Papers 1111 (July 19,\n\n1993).\n\n           A few weeks after the President's announcement, the House\n\nand   Senate   Armed    Services   Committees    proposed    to   codify   the\n\nmilitary's policy.      The Senate Report, in support of this effort,\n\nstated that the Committee was acting only after it had considered\n\n\"a wide range of experiences, including those of current and former\n\nservicemembers who have publicly identified themselves as gay or\n\nlesbian\" and after having \"carefully considered all points of\n\nview.\"   S. Rep. 103-112 at 270.        Similarly, the House Committee\n\nreported that its recommendation was based on \"an extensive hearing\n\nrecord as well as full consideration of the extended public debate\n\non this issue . .      .\"   H.R. Rep. 103-200 at 287 (1993) reprinted in\n\n\n                                   - 35 -\n\f1993 U.S.C.C.A.N 2073 at 2074.          The Senate Report also focused\n\nexplicitly on the effect that the Act could have on constitutional\n\nrights of homosexuals, concluding that \"if the Supreme Court should\n\nreverse its ruling in Bowers and hold that private consensual\n\nhomosexual acts between adults may not be prosecuted in civilian\n\nsociety, this would not alter the committee's judgment as to the\n\neffect of homosexual conduct in the armed forces.\" S. Rep. 103-112\n\nat 287.\n\n            Prior to the enactment of the Act, the full House and\n\nSenate debated the measure and considered floor amendments.                    In\n\nparticular,    each   house   rejected       amendments   that     would    have\n\npermitted    the   military   to    develop   whatever    policy    it     deemed\n\nappropriate and would have allowed the Department to resume asking\n\napplicants to state their sexual orientation. 139 Cong. Rec.\n\nS11168-11228 (Sept. 9, 1993); 139 Cong. Rec. H7084-86 (Sept. 29,\n\n1993).      The Act became law in November 1993, and, as stated\n\nearlier, the Act expressly identified its purpose as preserving\n\n\"high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit\n\ncohesion\" in the military.         10 U.S.C. § 654(a)(15).\n\n            The circumstances surrounding the Act's passage lead to\n\nthe firm conclusion that Congress and the Executive studied the\n\nissues intensely and from many angles, including by considering the\n\nconstitutional rights of gay and lesbian service members.                S. Rep.\n\n103-112   at   286-87.    Congress      ultimately    concluded      that    the\n\n\n                                    - 36 -\n\fvoluminous    evidentiary    record       supported   adopting      a   policy     of\n\nseparating certain homosexuals from military service to preserve\n\nthe \"high morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion\" of\n\nthe troops.\n\n            Acknowledging the government interest identified in this\n\ncase, one that our deferential posture requires us to take at face\n\nvalue, as-applied challenges to the Act must fail as well.\n\n            Here, as in Rostker, there is a detailed legislative\n\nrecord concerning Congress' reasons for passing the Act.                      This\n\nrecord   makes    plain   that    Congress      concluded,    after     considered\n\ndeliberation, that the Act was necessary to preserve the military's\n\neffectiveness as a fighting force, 10 U.S.C. § 654(a)(15), and\n\nthus, to ensure national security.           This is an exceedingly weighty\n\ninterest and one that unquestionably surpasses the government\n\ninterest that was at stake in Lawrence.            See Lawrence, 539 U.S. at\n\n585 (O'Connor, J., concurring).\n\n            Every as-applied challenge brought by a member of the\n\narmed    forces   against   the    Act,    at   its   core,   implicates      this\n\ninterest.    Every member of the armed forces has one fact in common\n\n-- at a moment's notice he or she may be deployed to a combat area.\n\n10 U.S.C. § 654(a)(11).      The conditions of service in such an area\n\nbring into play the animating concerns behind the Act, namely,\n\nmaintaining the morale and unit cohesion that the military deems\n\nessential    to   an   effective    fighting      force.      See     10   U.S.C   §\n\n\n                                    - 37 -\n\f654(a)(12), (15).   Accordingly, we have no choice but to dismiss\n\nthe plaintiffs' as-applied challenge.\n\n          To be sure, deference to Congressional judgment in this\n\narea does not mean abdication.    Rostker, 453 U.S. at 67.   But where\n\nCongress has articulated a substantial government interest for a\n\nlaw, and where the challenges in question implicate that interest,\n\njudicial intrusion is simply not warranted.     See id. at 68 (\"[W]e\n\nmust be particularly careful not to substitute our judgment of what\n\nis desirable for that of Congress, or our own evaluation of\n\nevidence for a reasonable evaluation by the Legislative Branch.\").10\n\n                        B.   Equal Protection\n\n          In addition to their due process claim, the plaintiffs\n\nassert that the Act is unconstitutional under equal protection\n\nprinciples.11   Unlike the due process claim, which is premised on\n\nthe constitutional protection afforded all citizens to engage in\n\ncertain sexual conduct, the equal protection claim is based on the\n\n\n\n10\n In Witt, the 9th Circuit resolved an as-applied, post-Lawrence\nsubstantive due process challenge to the Act differently then we do\nhere. 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 10794, at *36. The 9th Circuit relied\non the Supreme Court’s pre-Lawrence decision in Sell as a\ntouchstone for its due process inquiry. Id. At 29-30. Although we\nfind Sell instructive in the sense that it illustrates the Supreme\nCourt’s application of an intermediate level of scrutiny, we do not\nfind Sell especially helpful in analyzing this statute regulating\nmilitary affairs.\n11\n The Fifth Amendment does not contain an equal protection clause\nbut the due process clause has been interpreted to include an equal\nprotection component. See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499\n(1954).\n\n                                 - 38 -\n\fAct's differential treatment of homosexual military members versus\n\nheterosexual military members.              See generally Erwin Chemerinsky,\n\nConstitutional Law: Principles and Policies § 10.1.1 (2d Ed. 2002)\n\n(explaining the difference between a due process and an equal\n\nprotection challenge).          The district court rejected this claim\n\nunder rational basis review.\n\n            Under equal protection jurisprudence, a governmental\n\nclassification aimed at a \"suspect class\" is subject to heightened\n\njudicial scrutiny.     See Mills v. State of Me., 118 F.3d 37, 46 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).      Classifications that target non-suspect classes are\n\nsubject only to rational basis review. Id. The plaintiffs contend\n\nthat the district court erred by applying rational basis review\n\nbecause the Supreme Court's decisions in Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S.\n\n620 (1996), and Lawrence mandate a more demanding standard.\n\n            In   Romer,   the      Supreme      Court     invalidated,     on   equal\n\nprotection    grounds,    a   Colorado       constitutional       amendment     which\n\nprohibited    the   enactment       of    any     measure   designed    to   protect\n\nindividuals due to their sexual orientation.                  The Court analyzed\n\nthe   constitutionality       of    the    amendment      through    the   prism    of\n\nrational basis, asking whether the classification bore \"a rational\n\nrelation to some legitimate end.\"                  Id. at 631.       Applying this\n\nstandard,     the    Court         concluded       that     the     amendment      was\n\nunconstitutional     because the only possible justification for the\n\namendment was \"animosity toward the class of persons affected,\"\n\n\n                                         - 39 -\n\fwhich   does    not   constitute      even   \"a    legitimate   governmental\n\ninterest.\"     Id. at 634-35.\n\n          Romer, by its own terms, applied rational basis review.\n\nThe ground for decision was the notion that where \"a law is\n\nchallenged as a denial of equal protection, and all that the\n\ngovernment can come up with in defense of the law is that the\n\npeople who are hurt by it happen to be irrationally hated or\n\nirrationally feared, . . . it is difficult to argue that the law is\n\nrational if 'rational' in this setting is to mean anything more\n\nthan democratic preference.\"          Milner v. Apfel, 148 F.3d 812, 817\n\n(7th Cir. 1998) (Posner, J.).          Romer nowhere suggested that the\n\nCourt recognized a new suspect class.             Absent additional guidance\n\nfrom the Supreme Court, we join our sister circuits in declining to\n\nread Romer as recognizing homosexuals as a suspect class for equal\n\nprotection purposes.      Scarborough v. Morgan County Bd. of Ed., 470\n\nF.3d 250, 261 (6th Cir. 2006); Citizens for Equal Prot. v. Bruning,\n\n455 F.3d 859, 866 (8th Cir. 2006); Johnson v. Johnson, 385 F.3d\n\n503, 532 (5th Cir. 2004); Lofton, 358 F.3d at 818; Veney v. Wyche,\n\n293 F.3d 726, 731-32 (4th Cir. 2002); Holmes, 124 F.3d at 1132.\n\n          Lawrence does not alter this conclusion.              As discussed\n\nearlier, Lawrence was a substantive due process decision that\n\nrecognized a right in all adults, regardless of sexual orientation,\n\nto engage in certain intimate conduct.            Indeed, the Lawrence Court\n\nexplicitly     declined   to   base    its   ruling    on   equal   protection\n\n\n                                   - 40 -\n\fprinciples, even though that issue was presented.           See Lawrence,\n\n539 U.S. at 574-75.       Thus, there is no basis for arguing that\n\nLawrence changed the standard of review applicable to a legislative\n\nclassification based on sexual orientation.\n\n           As neither Romer nor Lawrence mandate heightened scrutiny\n\nof the Act because of its classification of homosexuals, the\n\ndistrict   court   was   correct   to   analyze   the   plaintiffs'   equal\n\nprotection claim under the rational basis standard.             As stated\n\nearlier, an enactment survives this level of scrutiny so long as\n\nthe \"classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to\n\na legitimate state interest.\"       City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne\n\nLiving Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985).\n\n           The plaintiffs maintain that, even under this standard,\n\ntheir claim survives because they will be able to demonstrate that\n\nthe Act was based on irrational animus and therefore is invalid\n\nunder Romer.   We disagree.    Congress has put forward a non-animus\n\nbased explanation for its decision to pass the Act.             Given the\n\nsubstantial deference owed Congress' assessment of the need for the\n\nlegislation, the Act survives rational basis review.12          Able, 155\n\nF.3d at 635-37; Holmes, 124 F.3d at 1132-40; Richenberg, 97 F.3d at\n\n262; Thomasson, 80 F.3d at 292.\n\n           In sum, the district court was correct to reject the\n\n\n12\n The plaintiffs acknowledge that a conclusion that the Act survives\nrational basis review defeats their facial and as-applied equal\nprotection challenges.\n\n                                   - 41 -\n\fplaintiffs' equal protection claim because homosexuals are not a\n\nsuspect class and the legitimate interests Congress put forward are\n\nrationally served by the Act.\n\n                         C.   First Amendment\n\n          The plaintiffs' final challenge attacks the portion of\n\nthe Act that subjects a member to possible separation for making a\n\nstatement identifying himself or herself as a homosexual.       The\n\nplaintiffs assert that they have adequately stated a claim that\n\nthis aspect of the Act violates the First Amendment because it\n\nsubjects a member to separation for stating his or her sexual\n\nidentity.13   The plaintiffs maintain that this aspect of the Act is\n\ninvalid because it restricts the content of the plaintiffs' speech\n\nand forces them to pretend that they are heterosexual.\n\n          There is no question that members of the military are\n\n\n\n13\n For the first time on appeal, the plaintiffs contend that a wide\nvariety   of   expressive   activities  could   trigger   discharge\nproceedings. They argue, \"A service member might wave a rainbow\nflag or wear a pink triangle, or he might state that he opposes\n'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.' Under § 654 . . . these possibilities and\nmore could force the service member -- whether straight or gay --\ninto discharge proceedings where he must prove that he has no\npropensity to engage in homosexual conduct.\"          None of the\nplaintiffs contend that they were separated from service because\nthey participated in expressive activities. Moreover, the explicit\nterms of the Act do not indicate that such activities could trigger\nseparation proceedings and the government has stipulated they do\nnot. DOD Directive 1332.414 § E3.A4; DOD Instruction 1332.40 § E8.\nIn any event, we decline to reach this newly raised overbreadth\nargument on appeal. See Brown v. Hot, Sexy & Safer Products, Inc.,\n68 F.3d 525, 530 (1st Cir. 1995) (stating that an appeal from a\nmotion to dismiss \"is not an opportunity to conjure new arguments\nnot raised before the district court.\").\n\n                                - 42 -\n\fengaging in speech when they state their sexual orientation.     See\n\nHurley v. Irish-American Gay & Lesbian & Bisexual Group of Boston,\n\nInc., 515 U.S. 557, 574-75 (1995).   There is also no question that\n\nFirst Amendment protections apply to some degree in the military\n\ncontext.   See Goldman, 475 U.S. at 503.       But \"our review of\n\nmilitary regulations challenged on First Amendment grounds is far\n\nmore deferential than constitutional review of similar laws or\n\nregulations designed for civilian society.\"   Id.    This limitation\n\nis rooted in the recognition that free expression can sometimes\n\nconflict with the military's compelling need to \"foster instinctive\n\nobedience, unity, commitment, and espirit de corps\" and that \"the\n\nessence of military service is the subordination of the desires and\n\ninterests of the individual to the needs of service.\" Id.\n\n           The Act does affect the right of military members to\n\nexpress their sexual orientation by establishing the possibility of\n\nadverse consequences from announcing their sexual orientation. But\n\nthe Act's purpose is not to restrict this kind of speech.        Its\n\npurpose is to identify those who have engaged or are likely to\n\nengage in a homosexual act as defined by the statute.     The law is\n\nthus aimed at eliminating certain conduct or the possibility of\n\ncertain conduct from occurring in the military environment, not at\n\nrestricting speech.   See, e.g., Phillips v. Perry, 106 F.3d   1420,\n\n1430 (9th Cir. 1997); Thomasson, 80 F.3d at 931.    The Act relies on\n\na member's speech only because a member's statement that he or she\n\n\n                              - 43 -\n\fis    homosexual    will   often   correlate       with   a   member    who   has    a\n\npropensity to engage in a homosexual act.\n\n             The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment \"does\n\nnot prohibit the evidentiary use of speech to establish\" a claim\n\n\"or to prove motive or intent.\"           Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U.S.\n\n476, 489 (1993); see also Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 612\n\n(1985).      As the Fourth Circuit explained in rejecting a challenge\n\nidentical to the one presented here:\n\n             There is no constitutional impediment, . . . to\n             the use of speech as relevant evidence of facts\n             that may furnish a permissible basis for\n             separation from military service.     No First\n             Amendment concern would arise, for instance,\n             from the discharge of service members for\n             declaring that they would refuse to follow\n             orders, or that they were addicted to\n             controlled substances. Such remarks provide\n             evidence of activity that the military may\n             validly proscribe.\n\nThomasson, 80 F.3d at 931.\n\n             We think that the Fourth Circuit has correctly analyzed\n\nthis claim.        To the extent that the Act may be constitutionally\n\napplied to circumscribe sexual conduct, the First Amendment does\n\nnot    bar   the    military   from   using    a    member's     declaration        of\n\nhomosexuality as evidence of a violation of the Act.                   We therefore\n\njoin the other courts that have rejected First Amendment challenges\n\nto the Act on this basis.          See Holmes, 124 F.3d at 1136; Able, 88\n\nF.3d at 1300; Thomasson, 80 F.3d at 931.\n\n             The plaintiffs argue that, after Lawrence, this analysis\n\n\n                                      - 44 -\n\fis \"outmoded.\"    We disagree.        The Act does not punish a member for\n\nmaking a statement regarding sexual orientation; separation from\n\nservice is mandated only because a member has engaged, intends to\n\nengage or has a propensity to engage in a homosexual act.                    This is\n\nstill a question concerning conduct (or likely conduct); the\n\nmember's speech continues to have only evidentiary significance in\n\nmaking this conduct-focused determination.\n\n           Citing Dawson v. Delaware, 503 U.S. 159 (1992), the\n\nplaintiffs also argue that the First Amendment nevertheless limits\n\nthe kinds of statements that may be used by the government as\n\nevidence in an adversary proceeding.            In Dawson, the Supreme Court\n\nheld that the defendant's membership in a white supremacist group\n\ncould not be introduced against him in a capital sentencing hearing\n\nbecause it violated the defendant's First Amendment right to\n\nassociate.    Id. at 166-68.     In reaching this conclusion, the Court\n\nemphasized that the admission violated the First Amendment because\n\nit had \"no bearing on the issue being tried.\"                   Id.   No similar\n\nclaim can be made here.       A statement by a member that he or she is\n\nhomosexual is undoubtedly relevant to the kind of conduct a member\n\nintends to engage in or has a propensity to engage in.                 See United\n\nStates   v.   Simkanin,   420    F.3d     397,     417-18      (5th   Cir.    2005)\n\n(concluding   that   Dawson     did    not     apply   where    the   defendant's\n\nstatement was relevant to the issues at sentencing).                   Therefore,\n\nDawson is inapposite.\n\n\n                                      - 45 -\n\f            Finally, plaintiffs argue that the Act's rebuttable\n\npresumption violates their First Amendment rights.             The Act's\n\nrebuttable presumption works as follows.       A military member may be\n\nseparated from the armed forces if,\n\n            the member has stated that he or she is a\n            homosexual or bisexual, or words to that\n            effect, unless there is a further finding,\n            made   and   approved  in   accordance   with\n            procedures set forth in the regulations, that\n            the member has demonstrated that he or she is\n            not a person who engages in, attempts to\n            engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or\n            intends to engage in homosexual acts.\n\n10 U.S.C. § 654(b)(2) (emphasis added).\n\n            The plaintiffs' attack on the rebuttable presumption is\n\ntwofold.    First, they claim that for homosexual military members,\n\nthe rebuttable presumption is functionally impossible to rebut.\n\nBecause    they   are   homosexual   within   the   meaning   of   section\n\n654(f)(1), they cannot prove that they are not homosexual as\n\nsection 654(b)(2) effectively requires.         Second, the plaintiffs\n\nargue that even if section 654(b)(2) did offer a presumption\n\ncapable of being rebutted by homosexual members, the existence of\n\nsuch a presumption \"would still force [them] and other gay and\n\nlesbian service members to live in an environment that severely\n\nrestricts and chills constitutionally protected speech.\"           We deal\n\nwith each contention in turn.\n\n            Each plaintiff has agreed that he or she is a person who\n\n\"engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in,\n\n\n                                 - 46 -\n\for intends to engage in homosexual acts.\"            10 U.S.C. § 654 (f)(1).\n\nBecause they admit they fall within section 654(f)(1)'s definition\n\nof homosexual, none of them could have proved at a separation\n\nproceeding that she or he was not a person who \"engages in,\n\nattempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to\n\nengage in\" prohibited conduct because, by definition, they are such\n\na person.    See id.     In that sense, for a military member who is\n\nhomosexual as defined by 654(f)(1), the rebuttable presumption\n\nwould be functionally impossible to rebut.\n\n            But that does not mean the Act violates the plaintiffs'\n\nFirst Amendment rights.        As noted earlier, the government may use\n\na member's statement that he or she is a homosexual as evidence\n\nthat he or she \"engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity\n\nto engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.\"                      If a\n\nperson cannot show otherwise, because in fact he or she does engage\n\nin or have such a propensity to engage in homosexual conduct, then\n\nthe military is entitled to separate that person from the service.\n\nThe military, in that scenario, is not punishing speech but conduct\n\nor propensity to engage in conduct.\n\n            Moreover,    the     contention     that    it   is     functionally\n\nimpossible for a gay member to say \"I am homosexual\" and then rebut\n\nthe presumption according to the terms of section 654(b)(2) is\n\ninaccurate   on   its    face.        A   member's   personal      definition    of\n\n\"homosexuality\"    may   not     be   coextensive    with    the    Act's.      For\n\n\n                                      - 47 -\n\fexample, a person may say he or she is homosexual even though the\n\nperson does not engage in, attempt to engage in, have a propensity\n\nto engage in, or intend to engage in homosexual acts.           In that\n\nscenario,    there   is   a   meaningful   opportunity   to   rebut   the\n\npresumption.     The Ninth Circuit's opinion in Holmes provides\n\nexamples.\n\n            One female Naval officer admitted to her\n            homosexuality but submitted a statement, in\n            which she stated, inter alia, that she\n            understands the rules against homosexual\n            conduct and intended to obey those rules.\n            Another female Naval officer stated that she\n            was a lesbian but that the statement 'in no\n            way, was meant to imply [] any propensity or\n            intent or desire to engage in prohibited\n            conduct.'\n\n\n124 F.3d at 1136.\n\n            Of course, a situation may arise where a gay member\n\ntriggers the rebuttable presumption by stating he is gay, proves he\n\nis not a person who \"engages in, attempts to engage in, has a\n\npropensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts,\"\n\nand yet is still separated from service.      This member would have an\n\nadministrative challenge available to him.      See 5 U.S.C. § 701.   No\n\nfacts have been plead suggesting such a scenario arose in this\n\ncase.\n\n            We now turn to the plaintiffs' alternative argument that\n\nthe rebuttable presumption, even if capable of being rebutted by\n\nhomosexual military members, chills their First Amendment rights.\n\n\n                                 - 48 -\n\fThe plaintiffs suggest that the presumption is content based and\n\nthus unconstitutional.     The Fourth Circuit rejected a similar\n\nargument in Thomasson.    It observed:\n\n            Whenever a provision prohibits certain acts,\n            it necessarily chills speech that constitutes\n            evidence of the acts. A regulation directed\n            at acts thus inevitably restricts a certain\n            type of speech; this policy is no exception.\n            But effects of this variety do not establish a\n            content-based restriction of speech.\n\n\nThomasson, 80 F.3d at 932.\n\n            As we explained, the Act's purpose is not to restrict\n\nmilitary members from expressing their sexual orientation.       Its\n\npurpose is to identify those who have engaged in or are likely to\n\nengage in a homosexual act.        The fact that the Act may, in\n\noperation, have the effect of chilling speech does not change the\n\nanalysis.    See Ward v.

I concur with the majority opinion regarding the\n\napplication of Lawrence to the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” statute, 10\n\nU.S.C. § 654 (the “Act”).             I also concur with the majority’s\n\ndiscussion of the plaintiffs’ equal protection challenge. However,\n\nI respectfully dissent from the discussion of the plaintiffs’ claim\n\nthat 10 U.S.C. § 654(b)(2)14 violates the First Amendment.\n\n            The military calls the evidentiary presumption created by\n\n10 U.S.C. § 654(b)(2) a “rebuttable” presumption.              See Department\n\nof Defense (“DoD”) Directive No. 1332.14 ¶ E3.A1.1.8.1.2.2 (amended\n\n1994) (“A statement by a Service member that he or she is a\n\nhomosexual    or    bisexual,    or   words    to   that   effect,   creates   a\n\nrebuttable presumption that the Service member engages in, attempts\n\nto engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage\n\nin homosexual acts.”) (emphasis added).              Because the plaintiffs\n\ndispute that the presumption is rebuttable, I adopt the phrasing\n\n\n\n14\n     10 U.S.C. § 654(b)(2) provides, in relevant part, that:\n\n       (b) A member of the armed forces shall be separated from\n       the armed forces . . . if one or more of the following\n       findings is made and approved . . .:\n\n       (2) That the member has stated that he or she is a\n       homosexual or bisexual, or words to that effect, unless\n       there is a further finding, made and approved in\n       accordance with procedures set forth in the regulations,\n       that the member has demonstrated that he or she is not a\n       person who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a\n       propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in\n       homosexual acts.\n\n                                      - 51 -\n\fused by the Second Circuit, and call the presumption the “statement\n\npresumption.”        See Able v. United States, 88 F.3d 1280, 1283 (2d\n\nCir. 1996).\n\n          1.          The Claims\n\n          Plaintiffs argue that the statement presumption violates\n\nthe First Amendment in two ways.             First, they contend that the\n\npresumption is a dead letter in practice because, as applied, “it\n\nis functionally impossible for a gay service member to say ‘I am\n\ngay’ and then prove that he has no ‘propensity’ to engage in\n\nhomosexual activity, even if the service member could show a track\n\nrecord of celibacy and an honest intent to refrain from prohibited\n\nconduct.” In the plaintiffs’ view, the only way to avoid discharge\n\nis to recant their sexual orientation.                 As such, the statement\n\npresumption     is    allegedly    used   to   punish     plaintiffs’   speech\n\nconcerning their own status as homosexuals.\n\n          Second,        the   plaintiffs      argue     that   the   statement\n\npresumption is an unconstitutional allocation of the burden of\n\nproof, which chills their own speech as well as a whole range of\n\nprotected expression by both gay and straight service members. The\n\nplaintiffs argue that:\n\n          The provision’s burden falls on any speaker\n          whose “[l]anguage or behavior” suggests to “a\n          reasonable person” that the person “intended\n          to convey” that he or she is gay. This broad\n          definition could chill a whole range of\n          protected expression: A service member might\n          wave a rainbow flag or wear a pink triangle,\n          or he might state that he opposes “Don’t Ask,\n\n                                    - 52 -\n\f          Don’t Tell.”   Under § 654's burden-shifting\n          mechanism, these possibilities and more could\n          force the service member -- whether straight\n          or gay -- into discharge proceedings where he\n          must prove that he has no propensity to engage\n          in homosexual conduct.\n\n(internal citations omitted).\n\n          2.        Content Neutrality\n\n          The starting point for the analysis is the difficult\n\nquestion of whether the statement presumption restricts speech\n\nbased on its content or viewpoint.           I ultimately agree with the\n\nmajority’s position that the statement presumption is content-\n\nneutral, but I believe that the issue is a much closer call.\n\n          “The First Amendment generally prevents government from\n\nproscribing     speech,   or    even   expressive   conduct,   because   of\n\ndisapproval of the ideas expressed.         Content-based regulations are\n\npresumptively invalid.”        R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377,\n\n382 (1992) (citations omitted).        A content-based restriction “can\n\nstand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny,” and thus is only\n\nconstitutional if it is “narrowly tailored to promote a compelling\n\nGovernment interest.” United States v. Playboy Entm’t Group, Inc.,\n\n529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000).\n\n          However, “[a] restriction that on its face appears to be\n\ncontent-based, yet serves another purpose that by itself is not\n\nspeech restrictive, may be constitutionally permitted.”          Able, 88\n\nF.3d at 1294.    Where a restriction does not “fit neatly into either\n\nthe ‘content-based’ or ‘content-neutral’ category,” the Supreme\n\n                                   - 53 -\n\fCourt has held that the speech restriction is content-neutral so\n\nlong as it is “justified without reference to the content of the\n\nregulated speech.”     City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475\n\nU.S.   41,   47-48   (1986)   (finding   zoning   ordinance   that   limits\n\nplacement of adult theaters content-neutral because it was “aimed\n\nnot at the content of the films shown . . . but rather at the\n\nsecondary effects of such theaters on the surrounding community”)\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n             Even a content-neutral statute, though, must pass First\n\nAmendment muster.     A content-neutral regulation is permissible:\n\n             [1] if it is within the constitutional power\n             of the Government;\n             [2] if it furthers an important or substantial\n             governmental interest;\n             [3] if the governmental interest is unrelated\n             to the suppression of free expression; and\n             [4] if the incidental restriction on alleged\n             First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is\n             essential to the furtherance of that interest.\n\nWayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 611 (1985) (quoting United\n\nStates v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968)).\n\n             The four circuits that addressed the constitutionality of\n\nthe Act soon after its passage (and before Lawrence)15 rejected\n\nFirst Amendment challenges to the statement presumption, but they\n\ndid not fully agree on the appropriate categorization of the First\n\nAmendment restriction.        In Thomasson v. Perry, 80 F.3d 915 (4th\n\n\n15\n  A recent post-Lawrence challenge to the statute did not include\na First Amendment claim. See Witt v. Dep’t of the Air Force, No.\n06-35644, 2008 WL 2120501 (9th Cir. May 21, 2008).\n\n                                  - 54 -\n\fCir. 1996) (en banc), involving a First Amendment challenge to the\n\nAct both on its face and as-applied, the Fourth Circuit rejected an\n\nargument that the statement presumption suppressed speech on the\n\nbasis of its content and viewpoint, holding:\n\n           The statute does not target speech declaring\n           homosexuality; rather it targets homosexual\n           acts and the propensity or intent to engage in\n           homosexual acts, and permissibly uses the\n           speech as evidence.    The use of speech as\n           evidence in this manner does not raise a\n           constitutional issue –- “the First Amendment .\n           . . does not prohibit the evidentiary use of\n           speech to establish the elements of a crime,”\n           or, as is the case here, “to prove motive or\n           intent.”\n\nId. at 931 (quoting Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U.S. 476, 489\n\n(1993)).   The Fourth Circuit pointed out that service members\n\nsubject to proceedings under the statement presumption have, in the\n\npast, “successfully demonstrated that they lack a propensity or\n\nintent to engage in homosexual acts.”       Id. at 932.       The Fourth\n\nCircuit relied on opinions from two district courts to demonstrate\n\nthat some service members had successfully rebutted the presumption\n\nof propensity.   See Richenberg v. Perry, 909 F. Supp. 1303, 1313\n\n(D. Neb. 1995) (noting that seven service members have successfully\n\nrebutted   the   presumption   but   not   describing   the     evidence\n\npresented), aff’d, 97 F.3d 256 (8th Cir. 1996); Able v. United\n\nStates, 880 F. Supp. 968, 976 (E.D.N.Y. 1995) (identifying three\n\ninstances where Navy members had been able to escape discharge, but\n\nconcluding that these instances were “obviously aberrations that\n\n\n                               - 55 -\n\fcannot be taken to show that the Act holds out any realistic\n\nopportunity to rebut the presumption”), vacated, 88 F.3d 1280, 1298\n\n(2d Cir. 1996) (rejecting the district court’s characterization of\n\nthese    cases    as   “aberrations”        and    stating       instead      that   “they\n\ndemonstrate that the admission of homosexual status does not\n\ninevitably   equate      with   a    finding       of    propensity      to    engage   in\n\nhomosexual acts”).\n\n            Two    circuits     similarly         held     that    the     Act   and its\n\nimplementing DoD Directives do not target mere status or speech,\n\nbut seek to identify and exclude those who are likely to engage in\n\nhomosexual acts.        See Richenberg v. Perry, 97 F.3d 256, 263 (8th\n\nCir. 1996) (agreeing with Thomasson); Holmes v. Cal. Army Nat’l\n\nGuard, 124 F.3d 1126, 1136 (9th Cir. 1997) (holding brevis that the\n\nstatement presumption does not violate the First Amendment because\n\nthe service members were discharged for their conduct and not for\n\ntheir speech).\n\n            In a thoughtful opinion, the Second Circuit in Able v.\n\nUnited States, 88 F.3d 1280 (2d Cir. 1996), addressed a facial\n\nchallenge to the statement presumption claiming that it violated\n\nthe First Amendment.       Assuming, without deciding, that separation\n\nof   a    service      member       based     on        status     alone       would    be\n\nunconstitutional, id. at 1297 n.10, the Second Circuit discussed\n\nwhether the statement presumption was content-neutral or content-\n\nbased.   Id. at 1294-96.        The court never opted for one label or the\n\n\n                                      - 56 -\n\fother,   holding    instead   that    the     statement    presumption   passed\n\nconstitutional muster under both standards.               Id. at 1295-96.   The\n\ncourt emphasized that, under United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S.\n\n739, 745 (1987), the plaintiffs failed to show that “no matter how\n\nthe Act [was] read, it punish[ed] status not conduct.”               Able, 88\n\nF.3d at 1297.      It reasoned:\n\n           Contrary to the district court, we do not\n           believe that, in the context of a facial\n           challenge, we may conclude that the Act\n           equates status with propensity. To be sure,\n           in most cases a member who admits to a\n           homosexual orientation will eventually be\n           separated from the armed forces. But that is\n           because the evidentiary value of the admission\n           is strongly linked to what it is used to\n           prove: a likelihood of engaging in homosexual\n           acts.   The plaintiffs cannot prove and the\n           district court cannot credibly maintain that\n           there are no instances in which a person will\n           be retained, despite admitting to a homosexual\n           status, because there is no likelihood that he\n           will engage in such acts.      The Directives\n           promulgated by the DoD in accordance with the\n           Act specifically contemplate that such an\n           event may occur.      See DoD Directive No.\n           1332.14, encl. 3, pt. 1, at H.1.b(2).\n\nId. at 1298.\n\n           As the Supreme Court has held, when it is not clear\n\nwhether a restriction is content-based or content-neutral, the\n\ncontrolling consideration is the governmental purpose in enacting\n\nthe legislation.      Renton, 475 U.S. at 48; see also Ward v. Rock\n\nAgainst Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989).             Here, the government\n\ninsists that the purpose of the Act is to target conduct, not\n\nstatus, and points to DoD Directives that limit the Act to only\n\n                                     - 57 -\n\fthose who engage in or are likely to engage in homosexual conduct.\n\nSee DoD Directive No. 1332.14 ¶ E2.1.10 (defining “propensity to\n\nengage   in    homosexual    acts”     to    mean   “more   than   an   abstract\n\npreference or desire to engage in homosexual acts; it indicates a\n\nlikelihood that a person engages in or will engage in homosexual\n\nacts”) (emphasis added); see also id. at ¶ E3.A1.1.8.1.2.2 (same).\n\nIn response, the plaintiffs point to the plain terms of the\n\nstatute, and also to a regulation that states that the statement\n\npresumption encompasses “[l]anguage or behavior that a reasonable\n\nperson would believe was intended to convey the statement that a\n\nperson engages in, attempts to engage in, or has a propensity to\n\nengage in homosexual acts.”            Id. at ¶ E2.1.16.           According to\n\nplaintiffs, given the vagueness of the term “propensity,” the\n\nstatement presumption can be interpreted to reach expressions of\n\nmere homosexual status.\n\n              While   the   question    is    close,   I    conclude    that   the\n\nstatement presumption is better viewed as content-neutral because\n\nits primary purpose, as set forth by the government, is to target\n\nconduct, not speech.        But see Thomasson, 80 F.3d at 934 (Luttig,\n\nJ., concurring) (agreeing with plaintiff that the purpose of\n\nCongress in passing the Act was to mandate exclusion of all known\n\nhomosexuals based on their orientation or status “regardless of\n\nwhether they have actually engaged in homosexual conduct or are\n\nlikely to engage in any such conduct”).\n\n\n                                     - 58 -\n\f              Thus, under the standard that applies to content-neutral\n\nrestrictions on speech, the critical remaining inquiries are “(1)\n\nwhether     the    statement[]     presumption     furthers   a    substantial\n\ngovernmental interest, and (2) whether the statement[] presumption\n\nrestricts the plaintiffs’ speech no more than is essential.” Able,\n\n88 F.3d at 1295 (emphasis added).             For the reasons stated by the\n\nmajority      opinion       with   respect    to   the   plaintiffs’      other\n\nconstitutional claims, the answer to the first of these inquiries\n\nis “yes.”      Accordingly, I now turn to the question of whether the\n\nstatement presumption, as applied, is overly restrictive of the\n\nplaintiffs’ speech.\n\n              3.      Dead Letter\n\n              Undaunted by pre-Lawrence case law, the plaintiffs, who\n\nall   admit    they   are    homosexual   within   the   meaning   of   Section\n\n654(f)(1),16 argue that the statement presumption burdens speech\n\nmore than is essential because, as applied, it is “functionally\n\nimpossible” to rebut the presumption short of recanting one’s\n\n\n\n16\n   As the majority correctly points out, “[e]ach plaintiff has\nagreed that he or she is a person who ‘engages in, attempts to\nengage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in\nhomosexual acts,’” as defined under the Act. Yet this concession\nby the plaintiffs does not end the matter because the plaintiffs\nalso argue that the Act’s definition of propensity improperly\nincludes homosexual status.     Thus, I do not understand the\nplaintiffs to be conceding that they could not have rebutted the\nstatement presumption under § 654(b)(2) if, as the government\nmaintains in defending the Act, “propensity” was limited to a\nlikelihood of engaging in prohibited homosexual acts while a\nservice member.\n\n                                     - 59 -\n\fstatus.   As such, plaintiffs allege that the statement presumption\n\npunishes service members who speak about their constitutionally\n\nprotected homosexual status by requiring their discharge.\n\n             The government disagrees with plaintiffs’ dead letter\n\ntheory that the statement presumption is impossible to rebut in\n\npractice. The government points out that, although the Act broadly\n\ndefines homosexual conduct to include a “propensity to engage in”\n\nhomosexual conduct, 10 U.S.C. § 654(f)(1), the implementing DoD\n\nDirectives narrowly interpret “propensity to engage in” homosexual\n\nconduct to mean “more than an abstract preference or desire to\n\nengage in homosexual acts; it indicates a likelihood that a person\n\nengages in or will engage in homosexual acts.”       DoD Directive No.\n\n1332.14 ¶ E2.1.10 (defining “propensity”) (emphasis added); see\n\nalso   id.   at   ¶   E3.A1.1.8.1.2.2   (same).   Accordingly,   in   the\n\ngovernment’s view, because a service member’s personal definition\n\nof “homosexuality” may not coincide with the Act’s definition, a\n\nservice member may be able to successfully rebut the statement\n\npresumption if he can show that his statement “I am gay” is not\n\nindicative of a likelihood that the he will engage in proscribed\n\nhomosexual conduct.\n\n             As several courts have pointed out, the line between\n\n“propensity” and “orientation” is razor-thin at best.       See, e.g.,\n\nAble, 880 F. Supp. at 975 (characterizing the distinction between\n\n“orientation” and “propensity” as “Orwellian”); Thomasson, 80 F.3d\n\n\n                                  - 60 -\n\fat 941-42 n.8 (Luttig, J., concurring) (“I do not know what\n\nhomosexual orientation is, if it is not the propensity to commit\n\nhomosexual acts; indeed, I do not understand how one even knows\n\nthat he has a homosexual orientation except by realizing that he\n\nhas a propensity toward the commission of homosexual acts.”).\n\nEmphasizing that “propensity” sweeps in everyone who is gay,\n\nplaintiffs allege that, in practice, gay and lesbian service\n\nmembers are routinely discharged despite evidence that there is no\n\nlikelihood that they will engage in proscribed homosexual conduct\n\nwhile they are in military service.          Accordingly, plaintiffs\n\ncontend that any honest admission of a gay or lesbian service\n\nmember’s sexual orientation results in discharge.\n\n           In my view, if the Act were applied to punish statements\n\nabout one’s status as a homosexual, it would constitute a content-\n\nbased speech restriction subject to strict scrutiny.      See Meinhold\n\nv. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 34 F.3d 1469, 1476-80 (9th Cir. 1994) (in an\n\nequal protection challenge to the military’s pre-“Don’t Ask, Don’t\n\nTell” homosexuality policy, construing the policy as only applying\n\nto conduct in order to avoid constitutional concerns that would\n\narise if the policy punished service members for “mere propensity”\n\nor status alone) (quoting Powell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514, 543-44\n\n(1968) (Black, J., concurring)).    Indeed, as Lawrence articulates,\n\n“Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of\n\nthought,   belief,   expression,   and   certain   intimate   conduct.”\n\n\n                               - 61 -\n\fLawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 562 (2003); see also Whitney v.\n\nCalifornia, 274 U.S. 357, 375 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring)\n\n(stating that the founders “believed that freedom to think as you\n\nwill and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the\n\ndiscovery and spread of political truth”).\n\n           It is telling that the government does not contend it has\n\na substantial interest, let alone a compelling one, in separating\n\na service member because of his or her status as a homosexual.\n\nRather, the government protests that it is not punishing homosexual\n\nstatus, and insists that it has an interest only in identifying and\n\nproscribing homosexual conduct to further its substantial interest\n\nin morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion.\n\n           As proof that the statement presumption is in fact\n\nrebuttable, the government highlights opinions, in particular Able\n\nand Holmes, that have found that the statement presumption has been\n\nsuccessfully rebutted in the past.            See Able, 88 F.3d at 1298\n\n(“[A]s   the   government     represented     at   oral   argument   without\n\ncontradiction,   in   seven    cases   (out   of   forty-three   attempts),\n\nservice members have been able to rebut the presumption created by\n\ntheir admission and have been retained.”); Holmes, 124 F.3d at 1136\n\n(pointing to several cases, including one where a “female Naval\n\nofficer admitted to her homosexuality but submitted a statement, in\n\nwhich she stated, inter alia, that she understands the rules\n\nagainst homosexual conduct and intended to obey those rules.”).\n\n\n                                  - 62 -\n\fHowever,     in   Able,     the   fact   that    some    service   members       were\n\nsuccessful was held to be sufficient to defeat a facial assault on\n\nthe statute under the Salerno standard.               See Able, 88 F.3d at 1297-\n\n98 (“Because plaintiffs have mounted a facial challenge to the Act,\n\nthey must show that, no matter how the Act is read, it punishes\n\nstatus and not conduct.”) (citing Salerno, 481 U.S. at 745). Here,\n\nin contrast to Able, plaintiffs mount an as-applied challenge by\n\nalleging the presumption is now functionally impossible to rebut\n\nshort of recanting. Although the government points to cases of the\n\nstatement presumption being successfully rebutted, the cherry-\n\npicked examples are all well over twelve years old:                In fact, some\n\n11,000 service members have been discharged under the Act since\n\n1993.    On a motion to dismiss, a court “must accept as true all the\n\nfactual allegations in the complaint,”                   Leatherman v. Tarrant\n\nCounty Narcotics Intelligence & Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163,\n\n164 (1993); accord Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955,\n\n1965    (a   court   must    assume   “that     all    the   allegations    in   the\n\ncomplaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)”), and a court must\n\nmake all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs’ favor.                   Clark v.\n\nBoscher, 514 F.3d 107, 112 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n             Finally, the government argues that even if the statement\n\npresumption is a dead letter in practice, any misapplication of the\n\npresumption can be cured by the availability of administrative\n\nreview.      It may be true that an individual service member may\n\n\n                                      - 63 -\n\fprevail in rebutting the presumption on administrative review short\n\nof recanting his status, by stating, for example, that he will\n\nrefrain from engaging in prohibited homosexual conduct.                 However,\n\nthe availability of an administrative remedy does not defeat a\n\nFirst   Amendment        claim   that    the    government    is   systematically\n\napplying the Act in such a way that it unconstitutionally burdens\n\nprotected speech. See Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 109 (1977)\n\n(“Constitutional questions obviously are unsuited to resolution in\n\nadministrative hearing procedures.”); see also Able, 88 F.3d at\n\n1289 (“[B]ecause none of the administrative boards before which the\n\nplaintiffs       would    appear   has    the    power   to   declare   the   Act\n\nunconstitutional, there is no realistic possibility that such\n\nproceedings would result in anything other than the plaintiffs’\n\ndischarge.”).\n\n            Accordingly, when all reasonable inferences are drawn in\n\ntheir favor, the plaintiffs have alleged a viable cause of action\n\nthat the burden placed by the government on gay and lesbian service\n\nmembers’ speech is “greater than is essential” to the government’s\n\ninterest in preventing the occurrence of homosexual acts in the\n\nmilitary.\n\n            4.           Chill\n\n            Plaintiffs also argue that the statement presumption is\n\nan unconstitutional allocation of the burden of proof, which chills\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 64 -\n\fa whole range of protected expression.17   The majority treats the\n\nplaintiffs’ chill claim as an “overbreadth” claim, although only\n\nAppellant Pietrangelo describes the claim in those terms.      This\n\ndesignation by the majority is understandable because plaintiffs\n\nare unclear as to whether this is a facial challenge, an as-applied\n\nchallenge, or both.\n\n          Because the plaintiffs have not expressly raised a facial\n\nchallenge to the statement presumption, I will treat the claim as\n\nan as-applied challenge.   The majority is correct to state that\n\n“[n]one of the plaintiffs contend that they were separated from\n\nservice because they participated in expressive activities.”   Op.\n\nat 41-42 n.13.   However, the core of the plaintiffs’ as-applied\n\nchallenge is that they were chilled from engaging in protected\n\nspeech, not that they were punished for engaging in such speech.\n\n          As a preliminary matter, the government has argued that\n\nthis allocation-of-proof challenge to the statement presumption was\n\n\n\n17\n   A group of constitutional law professors submitted an amicus\nbrief in support of this argument.

However, in a\n\nFirst    Amendment       case,          “[o]nce     a   federal   claim     is     properly\n\npresented, a party can make any argument in support of that claim;\n\nparties are not limited to the precise arguments they made below.”\n\nSee Lebron v. Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp., 513 U.S. 374, 379 (1995)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).                     Accordingly, in my view, in\n\nthis    case    involving          a    First    Amendment    challenge,        plaintiffs’\n\nargument       that     the    statement          presumption     violates       the    First\n\nAmendment      because        it       requires    service    members      to    rebut    the\n\npresumption should not be deemed waived.\n\n               The government contends that the DoD Directives and\n\nIssuances       specifically            carve     out   protected    speech,           quoting\n\nDirectives and Issuances that show that the presumption is not\n\ntriggered by rumors, suspicions, or capricious claims of others,\n\nsee DoD Directive No. 1332.14 ¶ E3.A4.1.3.3, or by going to a gay\n\nor lesbian bar, possessing or reading homosexual publications,\n\nassociating with gays and lesbians, or marching in a gay rights\n\nparade in civilian clothes.                   See id. ¶ E3.A4.1.3.3.4; see also S.\n\nRep. No. 103-112, at 292 (1993) (“What the policy recognizes is\n\nthat heterosexuals, as well as homosexuals, might march in gay\n\nrights parades, frequent a gay bar, [and] read gay literature.”).\n\n               Citing    Parker          v.     Levy,   417   U.S.   733    (1974),       the\n\n\n                                              - 66 -\n\fgovernment argues that the military’s need for obedience and\n\nnecessity “may render permissible within the military that which\n\nwould be constitutionally impermissible outside it.”            417 U.S. at\n\n758 (affording deference to regulations applied to an Army doctor\n\nwho protested Vietnam War and refused to obey orders on base).           As\n\nthe Supreme Court has held, its “review of military regulations\n\nchallenged on First Amendment grounds is far more deferential than\n\nconstitutional review of similar laws or regulations designed for\n\ncivilian society.”     Goldman v. Weinberger, 475 U.S. 503, 507\n\n(1986).   Moreover, Congress is given the “highest deference” when\n\nlegislating in the realm of military affairs.           Loving v. United\n\nStates, 517 U.S. 748, 768 (1996); see also Solorio v. United\n\nStates, 483 U.S. 435, 447 (1987) (noting that Congress has “primary\n\nresponsibility for the delicate task of balancing the rights of\n\nservicemen against the needs of the military”).\n\n          While   judicial   deference   is    “at   its    apogee”   when\n\nlegislative   action   regarding   military   affairs      is   challenged,\n\n“deference does not mean abdication.”         Rostker v. Goldberg, 453\n\nU.S. 57, 70 (1981) (“None of this is to say that Congress is free\n\nto disregard the Constitution when it acts in the area of military\n\naffairs.”).   The Supreme Court has struck down restrictions on\n\nspeech imposed by Congress on First Amendment grounds, even when\n\nmilitary matters were involved.     See Schacht v. United States, 398\n\nU.S. 58, 60, 62-63 (1970) (striking down a statutory restriction\n\n\n                               - 67 -\n\fthat allowed the wearing of military uniforms by actors in civilian\n\ntheatrical productions only when such productions would not “tend\n\nto discredit” the military).\n\n             The Supreme Court has afforded its strongest deference to\n\nthe military for speech in military settings.                    See, e.g., Goldman,\n\n475   U.S.    at   507-10    (affording        deference        to    regulation       that\n\nprevented soldiers from wearing yarmulkes while on duty and in\n\nuniform); Brown v. Glines, 444 U.S. 348, 354-55 (1980) (affording\n\ndeference to regulation that prevented soldiers from circulating\n\npetitions on air force bases).               Even then, the deference is not\n\nabsolute.     In Brown v. Glines, for example, the Court held that the\n\nlimitations on on-base petitions “restrict speech no more than is\n\nreasonably necessary” because it allowed for alternative channels\n\nof protest, such as through the United States mail, and the\n\nregulations     “specifically        prevent    commanders           from   halting    the\n\ndistribution of materials that merely criticize the Government or\n\nits policies.”      444 U.S. at 355.\n\n             The   most     troubling    aspect          of    the    Act’s    statement\n\npresumption is that it covers purely private speech, and public\n\nspeech made off base and off duty.                  By its own terms, the Act is\n\n“pervasive” in scope, applies “24 hours [a] day,” and applies even\n\nto speech made “off base” and/or “off duty.”                         See 10 U.S.C. §§\n\n654(a)(9)-(11).        Thus,    as    alleged       in    the    complaint,      the    Act\n\nrequired     the   discharge    of    some     of    the      plaintiffs      based    upon\n\n\n                                       - 68 -\n\fstrictly private speech, such as confiding in a friend or words\n\nwithin a letter from a friend or family member.                    In addition, the\n\namicus brief submitted by the constitutional law professors cites\n\nthe example of an Arizona state representative who spoke about his\n\nhomosexuality on the floor of the legislature.                   After the military\n\ndiscovered the speech through an anonymous complaint and initiated\n\ndischarge proceedings against the representative, he negotiated a\n\nvoluntary       separation    from      the    Army.       See     generally   Tobias\n\nBarrington Wolff, Political Representation and Accountability Under\n\nDon’t Ask, Don’t Tell, 89 Iowa L. Rev. 1633, 1644-50 (2004)\n\n(providing      examples     of   the    Act’s       statement   presumption     being\n\napplied    to    conversations       with      family    members,     sessions    with\n\nchaplains and psychotherapists, and certain public statements).\n\n            Plaintiffs       argue      that   the     statement    presumption,   as\n\napplied,    chills     speech     because        a    service    member   will   fear\n\ntriggering a discharge proceeding, regardless of whether he or she\n\ncould successfully rebut the presumption.                   As the Supreme Court\n\nexplained when striking down a statement presumption in another\n\ncontext, “[t]he man who knows that he must bring forth proof and\n\npersuade another of the lawfulness of his conduct necessarily must\n\nsteer far wider of the unlawful zone than if the State must bear\n\nthese burdens.”      Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 526 (1958) (in\n\na due process challenge, invalidating a statute that conditioned a\n\nveteran’s tax exemption on the signing of an oath disavowing the\n\n\n                                         - 69 -\n\fviolent    overthrow      of   the    government      and    that   established     a\n\nrebuttable presumption against eligibility for the exemption if one\n\nfailed to sign the oath); see also Smith v. California, 361 U.S.\n\n147, 150-51 (1939) (explaining that “the allocation of the burden\n\nof proof,” like many other legal devices that ordinarily pass\n\nconstitutional muster, “cannot be applied in settings where they\n\nhave the collateral effect of inhibiting the freedom of expression,\n\nby making the individual the more reluctant to use it.”).                           As\n\nalleged, the Act’s statement presumption chills individual service\n\nmembers from discussing homosexuality both privately and publicly\n\neven when they have no intent to engage in prohibited homosexual\n\nconduct.\n\n            In conclusion, the plaintiffs’ burden is a tough one in\n\nlight of the strong deference owed to Congress and the military\n\nseeking    to   protect    unit      cohesion.      Yet,    when    all   reasonable\n\ninferences      are   drawn    in     their     favor,     plaintiffs     have   made\n\nsufficient      allegations       that    the     burden    that    the    statement\n\npresumption     places    on   speech      is     greater    than   is    essential,\n\nparticularly in nonmilitary settings off base and off duty.                      Thus,\n\nI believe that the motion to dismiss should be denied.                    Because the\n\nmajority holds otherwise, I respectfully dissent in this very\n\ndifficult case.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 70 -\n\f",

The Act, known as \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" provides for the separation of members of the military who engage, attempt to engage, intend to engage, or have a propensity to engage in a homosexual act. <i>Id.</i> § 654(b). In the aftermath of this congressional action, several members of the military brought constitutional challenges, claiming the Act violated the due process and equal protection components of the Fifth Amendment and the free speech clause of the First Amendment. These challenges were rejected in other circuits. <i>See </i><i>Able v. United States,</i> 155 F.3d 628 (2d Cir.1998); <i>Holmes v. Cal. Army Nat'l Guard,</i> 124 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir.1997); <i>Richenberg v. Perry,</i> 97 F.3d 256 (8th Cir.1996); <i>Able v. United States,</i> 88 F.3d 1280 (2d Cir.1996); <i>Thomasson v. Perry,</i> 80 F.3d 915 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p>In 2003, the United States Supreme Court invalidated, on substantive due process grounds, two convictions under a Texas law criminalizing sodomy between consenting homosexual adults. <i>Lawrence v. Texas,</i> 539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003). <i>Lawrence</i> has reinvigorated the debate over the Act's constitutionality. <i>E.g.,</i> Pamela Glazner, <i>Constitutional Doctrine Meets Reality: Don't Ask, Don't Tell in Light of Lawrence v. Texas,</i> 46 Santa Clara L.Rev. 635 (2006); Note, <i>The Military's Ban on Consensual Sodomy in a Post-Lawrence World,</i> 21 Wash. U.J.L. &amp; Pol'y 379 (2006); Jeffrey S. Dietz, <i>Getting Beyond Sodomy: Lawrence and Don't Ask, Don't Tell,</i> 2 Stan. J.C.R. &amp; C.L. 63 (2005). This case is the second post-<i>Lawrence</i> challenge to the Act to be decided by a federal court of appeals.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Statutory and Regulatory Scheme</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We begin by summarizing the statutory framework and the accompanying Department of Defense (Department) directives. During the 1992 campaign, President Clinton, preceding his first election, promised to revisit the longstanding Department policy of separating homosexual individuals from military service. After taking office, President Clinton directed the Secretary of Defense to review Department policy, and Congress undertook its own review.</p>\n<p>As part of the congressional review, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, in testimony explicitly adopted by the Senate Armed Services Committee, explained the rationale for the policy of separating certain homosexual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> members of the military from continued service:</p>\n<blockquote>It is very difficult in a military setting, where you don't get a choice of association, where you don't get a choice of where you live, to introduce a group of individuals who are proud, brave, loyal, good Americans, but who favor a homosexual lifestyle, and put them in with heterosexuals who would prefer not to have somebody of the same sex find them sexually attractive, put them in close proximity and ask them to share the most private facilities together, the bedroom, the barracks, latrines, and showers. I think that this is a very difficult problem to give the military. I think it would be prejudicial to good order and discipline to try to integrate that in the current military structure.</blockquote>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 103-112 at 283 (1993).</p>\n<p>Congress' review culminated in the passage of the Act. <i>See</i> National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Pub.L. No. 103-160, 107 Stat. 1547 § 571, <i>codified at</i> 10 U.S.C. § 654. The Act opens with a series of findings that echo General Powell's concerns: \"military life is fundamentally different from civilian life;\" \"[s]uccess in combat requires military units that are characterized by high morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion;\" and \"the presence in the armed forces of persons who demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability.\" <i>See</i> 10 U.S.C. § 654(a).</p>\n<p>To avoid the risk to unit cohesion created by the continued service of those who are likely to engage in a homosexual act, the Act provides that members of the military are subject to separation from service where one of three findings is made: (1) the member has engaged or attempted to engage in a homosexual act;<sup>[2]</sup> (2) the member has \"state[d] that he or she is a homosexual or words to that effect;\" or (3) the member has married or attempted to marry a person known to be of the same biological sex. <i>Id.</i> § 654(b).</p>\n<p>If a finding is made that a member of the military has engaged or attempted to engage in a homosexual act, the member may avoid separation by establishing that: (1) the conduct was a departure from the member's usual and customary behavior; (2) such conduct is unlikely to recur; (3) such conduct was not accomplished by use of force, coercion, or intimidation; (4) under the particular circumstances of the case, the member's continued presence in the military is consistent with the interests of the military in proper discipline, good order, and morale; and (5) the member does not have a propensity or intent to engage in a future homosexual act. <i>Id.</i> § 654(b)(1)(A)-(E). Similarly, a member found to have stated, in effect, that he or she is homosexual, may avoid separation by demonstrating \"that he or she is not a person who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in a homosexual act.\" <i>Id.</i> § 654(b)(2).</p>\n<p>Pursuant to authority granted by the Act, the Department issued directives for executing separation proceedings. The directives recite the three reasons under the Act for separation and provide that a member's statement that he or she is a homosexual \"creates a rebuttable presumption <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> that the [member] engages in, attempts to engage in, intends to engage in, or has a propensity to engage in a homosexual act.\" DOD Directive 1332.40 § E2.3 (1997). In considering whether a member has rebutted this presumption, the military considers: (1) whether the member has engaged in a homosexual act; (2) the member's credibility; (3) testimony from others about the member's past conduct; (4) the nature and circumstances of the member's statement; and (5) any other evidence relevant to whether the member is likely to engage in a homosexual act. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>The Complaint and Motion to Dismiss</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs are twelve former members of the United States military who were separated from service under the Act. The plaintiffs' complaint asserted the following claims: (1) the Act violates the plaintiffs' right to substantive due process on its face and as applied; (2) the Act denies the plaintiffs equal protection of the law on the basis of sexual orientation; and (3) the portion of the Act that triggers separation proceedings based on a member's statement that he or she is homosexual violates the right to freedom of speech.</p>\n<p>The government moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The government also contended that the plaintiffs' due process and equal protection claims failed because the Act was subject only to rational basis review, and Congress' \"unit cohesion\" justification sufficed to sustain the law under this standard as a matter of law. It also argued that the evidentiary use of a member's statement that he or she is homosexual to prove that the member has engaged, intends to engage, or has a propensity to engage in a homosexual act does not abridge First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>The District Court Opinion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court began its analysis by dispatching with the plaintiffs' as-applied due process challenges. <i>Cook v. Rumsfeld,</i> 429 F.Supp.2d 385 (D.Mass.2006). The court ruled that, while the complaint asserted that the plaintiffs were bringing as-applied challenges, in fact, they pleaded no such claims:</p>\n<blockquote>Although the complaint alleges that [the Act] is unconstitutional ... as it has been particularly applied to each of [the plaintiffs], their legal reasoning ... make[s] it clear that the constitutional defects they perceive inhere in any application of the policy to homosexual service members, rather than in the particular way the policy might be (or might have been) applied in specific cases. In other words, none of the plaintiffs claim that the policy, if valid in general, was <i>misapplied</i> in his or her particular case to result in separation when a proper application of the policy would have allowed him or her to remain in service. Rather, their objections... are <i>that</i> the policy was applied, not <i>how</i> it was applied. This is classically a facial challenge to the statute, and their arguments will be evaluated with that understanding.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 390 (emphases supplied).</p>\n<p>The district court then turned to the plaintiffs' facial challenges, beginning with the due process and equal protection claims. <i>Id.</i> at 391-407. The court believed that the success of these claims hinged primarily on the level of scrutiny that applies after <i>Lawrence. Id.</i> at 393. The court closely analyzed <i>Lawrence</i> and determined that the Supreme Court employed rational basis review to invalidate the convictions under the Texas law against homosexual sodomy. The court, thus, concluded that <i>Lawrence</i> did not alter <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> the applicability of rational basis review, which had been applied in pre-<i>Lawrence</i> challenges to the Act. <i>Id.</i> at 395-96. The court then determined, in accord with pre-<i>Lawrence</i> authority, that Congress had set forth a rational reason for the statute  to promote unit cohesion and discipline  and therefore the facial due process and equal protection claims failed. <i>Id.</i> at 397-406.</p>\n<p>Finally, the district court rejected the plaintiffs' First Amendment challenge. <i>Id.</i> at 407-08. The court noted that the Act does not make a member's statement that he or she is a homosexual a basis for separation; rather separation is mandated only where there has been homosexual conduct or a demonstration of a propensity or intent to engage in such conduct. <i>Id.</i> at 407. Based on this understanding, the court concluded that the Act merely provides for the \"evidentiary use\" of a member's statement regarding sexual orientation and that such use does not violate the First Amendment. <i>Id.</i> at 408.</p>\n<p>Having concluded that all of the plaintiffs' claims failed as a matter of law, the district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice and entered a final judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 410. The plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. <i>Standard of Review</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of a motion to dismiss de novo, accepting the complaint's well-pleaded facts as true and indulging all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor. <i>SFW Arecibo, Ltd. v. Rodriguez,</i> 415 F.3d 135, 138-39 (1st Cir.2005). To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must allege a \"plausible entitlement to relief.\" <i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1967, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); <i>Rodriguez-Ortiz v. Margo Caribe, Inc.,</i> 490 F.3d 92, 95 (1st Cir.2007). In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, \"we are not wedded to the [district] court's rationale and may affirm an order of dismissal on any basis made apparent from the record.\" <i>McCloskey v. Mueller,</i> 446 F.3d 262, 266 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>On appeal, the plaintiffs challenge all aspects of the district court's ruling. They contend that the district court incorrectly dismissed their substantive due process and equal protection claims because the court misunderstood <i>Lawrence</i> to mandate a rational basis standard of review, rather than some form of heightened judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p>In addition, the plaintiffs dispute the district court's ruling that they did not present as-applied due process and equal protection challenges. Finally, they posit that they sufficiently pleaded a First Amendment challenge to the portion of the Act that triggers separation proceeding based on a member's statement of sexual identity because such a statement is a form of protected speech that is punished by the Act.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Due Process</h2>\n<p>We agree with the parties and the district court that interpreting <i>Lawrence</i> is the critical first step in evaluating the plaintiffs' substantive due process claim. Prior to <i>Lawrence,</i> the courts of appeals, relying on the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Bowers v. Hardwick,</i> 478 U.S. 186, 106 S.Ct. 2841, 92 L.Ed.2d 140 (1986) that homosexuals did not possess a substantive due process interest in engaging in sodomy, considered due process challenges to the Act under rational basis review.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>Richenberg,</i> 97 F.3d at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> 260-61; <i>Thomasson,</i> 80 F.3d at 928. But <i>Lawrence</i> overruled <i>Bowers,</i> so the post-<i>Lawrence</i> standard for reviewing a substantive due process challenge to the Act is unclear. Before addressing the district court's conclusion that the rational basis standard continues to apply, we review basic substantive due process principles.</p>\n<p>It has long been held that, despite their name, the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments \"guarantee[] more than fair process.\" <i>Troxel v. Granville,</i> 530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000). The substantive component of due process \"provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.\" <i>Washington v. Glucksberg,</i> 521 U.S. 702, 720, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court acts with \"caution and restraint\" when classifying a particular liberty interest as triggering substantive due process protection, <i>Moore v. City of E. Cleveland,</i> 431 U.S. 494, 502, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977), because classifying an interest as protected by due process to a \"great extent, place[s a] matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action.\" <i>Glucksberg,</i> 521 U.S. at 720, 117 S.Ct. 2258. The Court has recognized that the \"Nation's history, legal tradition, and practices provide the crucial guideposts for responsible decisionmaking\" in this area. <i>Id.</i> at 721, 117 S.Ct. 2258. But it has also recognized that while \"history and tradition are the starting point,\" they are \"not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due process inquiry.\" <i>Lawrence,</i> 539 U.S. at 572, 123 S.Ct. 2472.</p>\n<p>In <i>Glucksberg,</i> the Supreme Court catalogued the following \"liberty interests\" as \"specially protected\" by the due process clause: the right to marry; to have children; to direct the education of one's children; to enjoy marital privacy; to use contraception; to maintain bodily integrity; to choose to have an abortion; and to refuse unwanted medical treatment. <i>Glucksberg,</i> 521 U.S. at 720, 117 S.Ct. 2258. The question here is whether <i>Lawrence</i> added to this list an adult's right \"to engage in consensual sexual intimacy in the home.\" <i>Lawrence,</i> 539 U.S. at 567, 123 S.Ct. 2472.</p>\n<p>In <i>Lawrence,</i> the Court considered a substantive due process challenge to two criminal convictions under a Texas statute criminalizing homosexual sodomy. <i>Id.</i> at 564, 123 S.Ct. 2472. The petitioners were two males who had been arrested for engaging in a sexual act in one of their apartments. <i>Id.</i> at 563, 123 S.Ct. 2472. The statute at issue provided that a \"person commits an offense if he engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex.\"<sup>[4]</sup><i>Id.</i> The <i>Lawrence</i> Court characterized the constitutional question as \"whether petitioners' criminal convictions for adult consensual sexual intimacy in the home violate their vital interests in liberty and privacy protected by the Due Process Clause.\" <i>Id.</i> at 564, 123 S.Ct. 2472.</p>\n<p><i>Lawrence</i> addressed this question by considering a line of Supreme Court authority <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> recognizing various due process rights that protect the formation and perpetuation of intimate relationships. <i>Id.</i> at 564, 123 S.Ct. 2472. It identified <i>Griswold v. Connecticut,</i> 381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965), as the \"pertinent beginning point.\" <i>Griswold</i> invalidated a law banning the use of contraceptives by married couples because there is due process protection for the realm of privacy implicit in the marital relationship and bedroom. <i>Lawrence,</i> 539 U.S. at 564-65, 123 S.Ct. 2472. From there, <i>Lawrence</i> discussed later cases that broadened the interest recognized in <i>Griswold,</i> including <i>Eisenstadt v. Baird,</i> 405 U.S. 438, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972), which invalidated a ban on contraception use by unmarried people; <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), which invalidated a law restricting a woman's right to abort a pregnancy; and <i>Carey v. Population Servs. Int'l,</i> 431 U.S. 678, 97 S.Ct. 2010, 52 L.Ed.2d 675 (1977), which struck down a prohibition on the sale of contraception to persons under sixteen years of age. Relying on these precedents, <i>Lawrence</i> concluded that Supreme Court substantive due process precedent establishes protection for \"certain decisions regarding sexual conduct [that] extend[] beyond the martial relationship.\" <i>Lawrence,</i> 539 U.S. at 565, 123 S.Ct. 2472.</p>\n<p><i>Lawrence</i> used these precedents as the launching point for its critique of <i>Bowers.</i> In <i>Bowers,</i> the Court rejected a due process challenge to a Georgia statute similar to the one challenged in <i>Lawrence. </i><i>Lawrence,</i> 539 U.S. at 566, 123 S.Ct. 2472. <i>Lawrence</i> criticized <i>Bowers</i> for focusing too narrowly on the \"right of homosexuals to engage in sodomy\" rather than on the broader right of adults to engage in private, consensual sexual intimacy:</p>\n<blockquote>To say that the issue in <i>Bowers</i> was simply the right to engage in certain sexual conduct demeans the claim the individual [in <i>Bowers</i>] put forward, just as it would demean a married couple were it to be said that marriage is simply about the right to have sexual intercourse. The laws involved in <i>Bowers</i> and here are, to be sure, statutes that purport to do no more than prohibit a particular sexual act. Their penalties and purposes, though, have more far-reaching consequences, touching upon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home. The statutes do seek to control a personal relationship that whether or not entitled to formal recognition in law, is within the liberty of persons to choose ...</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 566-67, 123 S.Ct. 2472.</p>\n<p>After identifying this analytical flaw in <i>Bowers,</i> the <i>Lawrence</i> Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote>[A]dults may choose to enter [into personal relationships] in the confines of their homes and their own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons. When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring. The liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right to make this choice.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 567, 123 S.Ct. 2472.</p>\n<p>Placing the final nail in <i>Bowers'</i> coffin, the <i>Lawrence</i> Court quoted from Justice Stevens' <i>Bowers</i> dissent that \"'individual decisions by married persons, concerning the intimacies of their physical relationship, even when not intended to produce offspring, are a form of liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. Moreover, this protection extends to intimate choices by unmarried as well as married persons.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 578, 123 S.Ct. 2472 (quoting <i>Bowers,</i> 478 U.S. at 216, 106 S.Ct. 2841 (Stevens, J., dissenting)). In formally overruling <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> <i>Bowers,</i> the Court stated that \"Justice Stevens' analysis ... should have been controlling in <i>Bowers</i> and should control here.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Having dispatched with <i>Bowers,</i> the Court turned to analyze the constitutionality of the convictions under the Texas statute:</p>\n<blockquote>The present case does not involve minors. It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused. It does not involve public conduct or prostitution. It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter. The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention from government. \"It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.\" The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,</i> 505 U.S. 833, 847, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992)).</p>\n<p>Courts and commentators interpreting <i>Lawrence</i> diverge over the doctrinal approach employed to invalidate the petitioners' convictions. Some have read <i>Lawrence</i> to apply a rational basis approach.<sup>[5]</sup> Others see the case as applying strict scrutiny.<sup>[6]</sup> And a third group view the case as applying a balancing of state and individual interests that cannot be characterized as strict scrutiny or rational basis.<sup>[7]</sup><i>Lawrence</i>'s <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> doctrinal approach is \"difficult to pin down.\" Nan D. Hunter, <i>Living with Lawrence,</i> 88 Minn. L.Rev. 1103 (2004). But we are persuaded that <i>Lawrence</i> did indeed recognize a protected liberty interest for adults to engage in private, consensual sexual intimacy and applied a balancing of constitutional interests that defies either the strict scrutiny or rational basis label.</p>\n<p>There are at least four reasons for reading <i>Lawrence</i> as recognizing a protected liberty interest. First, <i>Lawrence</i> relies on the following due process cases for doctrinal support: <i>Griswold, Eisenstadt, Roe, Carey,</i> and <i>Casey.</i> 539 U.S. at 565-66, 123 S.Ct. 2472. Each case resulted in the Supreme Court recognizing a due process right to make personal decisions related to sexual conduct that mandated the application of heightened judicial scrutiny. <i>Id.</i> It would be strange indeed to interpret <i>Lawrence</i> as not recognizing a protected liberty interest when virtually every case it relied upon for support recognized such an interest.</p>\n<p>Second, the language employed throughout <i>Lawrence</i> supports the recognition of a protected liberty interest. <i>Lawrence</i> associated the right at issue with the core constitutional rights of \"freedom of thought, belief, and expression,\" rights which undoubtedly mandate special protection under the Constitution. <i>Id.</i> at 563, 123 S.Ct. 2472. It also stated that \"liberty gives <i>substantial</i> protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex.\" <i>Id.</i> at 572, 123 S.Ct. 2472 (emphasis supplied). And it concluded its analysis by stating that the \"right to liberty under the Due Process Clause\" allowed the petitioners to engage in \"private sexual conduct\" because \"`[i]t is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 578, 123 S.Ct. 2472 (quoting <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S. at 847, 112 S.Ct. 2791). Such language strongly suggests that <i>Lawrence</i> identified a protected liberty interest.</p>\n<p>Third, in overruling <i>Bowers, Lawrence</i> relied on Justice Stevens' <i>Bowers</i> dissent as stating the controlling principles. <i>Id.</i> at 578, 123 S.Ct. 2472. The passage of Justice Stevens' dissent quoted in <i>Lawrence</i> stated that \"individual decisions by married persons, concerning the intimacies of their physical relationship, even when not intended to produce offspring, are a form of liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.... Moreover, this protection extends to intimate choices by unmarried as well as married persons.\" <i>Id.</i> In support of this proposition, Justice Stevens cited <i>Griswold, Eisenstadt</i> and <i>Carey. </i><i>Bowers,</i> 478 U.S. at 216, 106 S.Ct. 2841 (Stevens, J., dissenting). As discussed above, these are due process cases that recognize protected liberty interests. Furthermore, in the very next passage of Justice Stevens' dissent, he described these cases as establishing rights that are \"fundamental\" and placed the right of adults to engage in private intimate conduct in the same category. <i>Id.</i> It is impossible to read <i>Lawrence</i> as declining to recognize a protected liberty interest without ignoring the Court's statement that Justice Stevens' <i>Bowers</i> dissent was controlling.</p>\n<p>Finally, if <i>Lawrence</i> had applied traditional rational basis review (the appropriate standard if no protected liberty interest was at stake, <i>see e.g., </i><i>Medeiros,</i> 431 F.3d at 33), the convictions under the Texas statute would have been sustained. The governmental interest in prohibiting immoral conduct was the only state interest that Texas offered to justify the statute. <i>Lawrence,</i> 539 U.S. at 582, 123 S.Ct. 2472. It is well established that a \"legislature [can] legitimately act ... to protect the societal interest in order and morality.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> <i>Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc.,</i> 501 U.S. 560, 569, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991) (quoting <i>Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton,</i> 413 U.S. 49, 61, 93 S.Ct. 2628, 37 L.Ed.2d 446 (1973)). Thus, <i>Lawrence's</i> holding can only be squared with the Supreme Court's acknowledgment of morality as a rational basis by concluding that a protected liberty interest was at stake, and therefore a rational basis for the law was not sufficient.</p>\n<p>Taking into account the precedent relied on by <i>Lawrence,</i> the tenor of its language, its special reliance on Justice Stevens' <i>Bowers</i> dissent, and its rejection of morality as an adequate basis for the law in question, we are convinced that <i>Lawrence</i> recognized that adults maintain a protected liberty interest to engage in certain \"consensual sexual intimacy in the home.\" The district court, relying on cases from other circuits, read <i>Lawrence</i> as applying rational basis review. We, however, do not find any of the four primary reasons supporting this view persuasive. <i>See </i><i>Muth v. Frank,</i> 412 F.3d 808, 817-18 (7th Cir.2005); <i>Lofton v. Sec'y of the Dep't of Children &amp; Family Servs.,</i> 358 F.3d 804, 815-17 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>First, the argument has been made that <i>Lawrence</i> nowhere explicitly stated that the right at issue was \"fundamental\" and therefore the opinion cannot be read as recognizing a fundamental right under the due process clause. <i>See </i><i>Cook,</i> 429 F.Supp.2d at 394. While it is true that <i>Lawrence</i> nowhere used the word \"fundamental\" to describe the interest at stake, there are several Supreme Court cases that have recognized protected liberty interests without using this word. For example, in <i>Washington v. Harper,</i> 494 U.S. 210, 223, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990), the Supreme Court held that a state prisoner \"retains a significant liberty interest\" under the due process clause to avoid the unwanted administration of certain drugs. And in <i>Parham v. J.R.,</i> 442 U.S. 584, 600, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979), the Court described a child's \"substantial liberty interest\" in not being confined unnecessarily for medical treatment. <i>See also </i><i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S. at 851, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (describing the interest as a \"protected liberty\"); <i>Cruzan v. Director of Mo. Dept. of Health,</i> 497 U.S. 261, 278, 110 S.Ct. 2841, 111 L.Ed.2d 224 (1990) (describing the interest as a \"constitutionally protected liberty interest\"); <i>Youngberg v. Romeo,</i> 457 U.S. 307, 315, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982) (describing the interests as \"liberty interests\"). It is thus clear that the Supreme Court does not always use the word \"fundamental\" when it wishes to identify an interest protected by substantive due process.</p>\n<p>Second, it has been maintained that <i>Lawrence</i> could not have identified a protected liberty interest because the Supreme Court did not engage in a thorough analysis of the \"Nation's history and tradition\" as required under <i>Glucksberg. </i><i>Muth,</i> 412 F.3d at 817; <i>Williams,</i> 378 F.3d at 1236; <i>Lofton,</i> 358 F.3d at 816-17. This argument is based on the mistaken premise that the only history relevant to the substantive due process inquiry is a history demonstrating affirmative government action to protect the right in question. But <i>Glucksberg</i> does not establish such a requirement. <i>Lawrence</i> engaged in a thorough historical analysis identifying the lack of a long history of government action to punish the private consensual, intimate conduct of homosexuals. This sort of historical analysis is not inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent in this area. Indeed, if affirmative government action protecting a right were required to trigger substantive due process protection, at least some of the due process cases recognizing a liberty interest would have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> come out differently because there was no established history of government protection for the right to have an abortion or to use contraception. <i>See </i><i>Roe,</i> 410 U.S. at 132-41, 93 S.Ct. 705 (reviewing history of abortion law to show that laws restricting abortion are of recent vintage but not showing any history of affirmative government action to protect the right to an abortion); <i>see also </i><i>Williams,</i> 378 F.3d at 1258-59.</p>\n<p>Moreover, to the extent that <i>Lawrence</i> did not adhere to the <i>Glucksberg</i> approach of locating the right to private, consensual adult intimacy in the Nation's history and tradition, it explicitly disavowed the exclusivity of this approach. <i>See </i><i>Lawrence,</i> 539 U.S. at 572, 123 S.Ct. 2472 (\"history and tradition are the starting but not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due process inquiry.\"). In this regard, the <i>Lawrence</i> Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>[W]e think that our laws and traditions in the past half century are of most relevance here. These references show an emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 571-72, 123 S.Ct. 2472. Thus, <i>Lawrence</i> recognized that, in at least some circumstances, the consideration of recent trends and practices is relevant to defining the scope of protected liberty.</p>\n<p>Third, it has been suggested that the <i>Lawrence</i> majority's refusal to respond to Justice Scalia's <i>Lawrence</i> dissent, in which he argued that the majority had not recognized a protected liberty interest, indicates that the majority agreed with the dissent's analysis. <i>See </i><i>Sylvester v. Fogley,</i> 465 F.3d 851, 858 (8th Cir.2006). The district court relied heavily on this point, observing that \"it might be expected that if [Justice Scalia's dissent] wrongly characterized a principal holding of the case, the majority would have answered and corrected it.\" <i>Cook,</i> 429 F.Supp.2d at 394.</p>\n<p>This is a possible explanation for the majority's silence, but it is not the only explanation. It is equally possible that the <i>Lawrence</i> majority believed that the text of its opinion stood for itself and that there was little to be gained by debating Justice Scalia on this point. <i>Cf. </i><i>Cent. Bank of Denver N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver N.A.,</i> 511 U.S. 164, 187, 114 S.Ct. 1439, 128 L.Ed.2d 119 (1994) (\"Congressional inaction lacks persuasive significance because several equally tenable inferences may be drawn from such inaction....\"). Given the equally possible, but conflicting, inferences that can be drawn from the majority's lack of response to Justice Scalia's dissent, we think that there is little to be gleaned about <i>Lawrence</i>'s meaning from it.</p>\n<p>Finally, it has been claimed that <i>Lawrence</i>'s conclusion that \"[t]he Texas statute furthers <i>no legitimate state interest</i> which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual\" indicates that <i>Lawrence</i> did not recognize a protected liberty interest. <i>Sylvester,</i> 465 F.3d at 857; <i>Muth,</i> 412 F.3d at 818; <i>Lofton,</i> 358 F.3d at 817 (emphasis supplied). This argument is premised on the notion that the words \"legitimate state interest\" indicate the application of rational basis review, which is not the proper standard where a protected liberty interest is implicated. As the district court stated, \"[t]he use of the appropriate adjective is telltale to constitutional lawyers. If the <i>Lawrence</i> court had been evaluating the constitutionality of the Texas statute under the more exacting standard where fundamental interests are at stake, it would instead have asked whether the state interest was compelling, rather than whether it was legitimate.\" <i>Cook,</i> 429 F.Supp.2d at 395.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> We take a different view. A law survives rational basis review so long as the law is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. <i>E.g., </i><i>Nordlinger v. Hahn,</i> 505 U.S. 1, 11-12, 112 S.Ct. 2326, 120 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992). Rational basis review does <i>not</i> permit consideration of the strength of the individual's interest or the extent of the intrusion on that interest caused by the law; the focus is entirely on the rationality of the state's reason for enacting the law. <i>See </i><i>Heller v. Doe,</i> 509 U.S. 312, 324, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (1993) (a law \"fails rational-basis review\" only when it \"rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State's objectives\" or the State's objectives are themselves invalid). Thus, the argument that <i>Lawrence</i> did not recognize a protected liberty interest because it used the words \"legitimate state interest\" divorces these word from context  a context which shows that <i>Lawrence</i> did not employ traditional rational basis review since the <i>Lawrence</i> Court's analysis focused on the individual's liberty interest. This view is supported by Supreme Court cases that have recognized protected liberty interests in the face of \"legitimate state interests.\" <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S. at 853, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (recognizing that even though protected liberty interest was at stake, \"the separate States could act in some degree to further their own legitimate interests in protecting prenatal life\"); <i>Addington v. Texas,</i> 441 U.S. 418, 425-26, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979) (balancing the \"individual's interest in not being involuntarily confined indefinitely\" against the state's \"legitimate interest under its <i>parens patriae</i> powers in providing care to its citizens who are unable because of emotional disorders to care for themselves\").</p>\n<p>To say, as we do, that <i>Lawrence</i> recognized a protected liberty interest for adults to engage in consensual sexual intimacy in the home does not mean that the Court applied strict scrutiny to invalidate the convictions. Several pre-<i>Lawrence</i> cases that have recognized protected liberty interests did not mandate that the challenged law be \"narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest\"  the strict scrutiny standard. For example, in <i>Sell v. United States,</i> 539 U.S. 166, 179, 123 S.Ct. 2174, 156 L.Ed.2d 197 (2003), the Court recognized a \"constitutionally protected liberty interest [for a criminal defendant] in avoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs\" and then applied a standard of review less demanding than strict scrutiny by asking whether administering the drugs was \"necessary significantly to further important governmental trial-related interests.\" And similarly, in <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S. at 877, 112 S.Ct. 2791, the Supreme Court reaffirmed a woman's fundamental right to choose to have an abortion but applied the \"undue burden\" test which balanced the state's legitimate interest in potential human life against the extent of the imposition on the woman's liberty interest. <i>See also </i><i>Troxel,</i> 530 U.S. at 67-75, 120 S.Ct. 2054 (invalidating law burdening due process interest in parental autonomy without applying either rational basis or strict scrutiny); <i>Riggins v. Nevada,</i> 504 U.S. 127, 135-36, 112 S.Ct. 1810, 118 L.Ed.2d 479 (1992) (balancing an individual's interest in refusing psychotropic drugs against the government's interest in trying a competent criminal defendant for a violent crime); <i>Cruzan,</i> 497 U.S. at 278-79, 110 S.Ct. 2841 (balancing \"protected liberty interest\" in refusing unwanted medical treatment against the government interest in promoting life); <i>Harper,</i> 494 U.S. at 223, 110 S.Ct. 1028 (weighing a prisoner's interest in refusing drugs against the government's interest in promoting a safe prison environment); <i>Youngberg,</i> 457 U.S. at 320-22, 102 S.Ct. 2452 (balancing liberty interest of an individual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> to avoid bodily restraint against the State's asserted reason for the restraint).</p>\n<p><i>Lawrence</i> is, in our view, another in this line of Supreme Court authority that identifies a protected liberty interest and then applies a standard of review that lies between strict scrutiny and rational basis. In invalidating the convictions, the <i>Lawrence</i> Court determined that there was no legitimate state interest that was adequate to \"justify\" the intrusion on liberty worked by the law. 539 U.S. at 578, 123 S.Ct. 2472. In other words, <i>Lawrence</i> balanced the strength of the state's asserted interest in prohibiting immoral conduct against the degree of intrusion into the petitioners' private sexual life caused by the statute in order to determine whether the law was unconstitutionally applied. <i>See </i><i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S. at 873, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (\"[N]ot every law which makes a right more difficult to exercise is, <i>ipso facto,</i> an infringement of that right.\").</p>\n<p>Having defined the nature of the constitutional review mandated by <i>Lawrence,</i> we now consider whether the plaintiffs' facial due process challenge to the Act can survive a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>\"A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid. The fact that [an Act] might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid....\" <i>United States v. Salerno,</i> 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987); <i>see also </i><i>Comfort v. Lynn Sch. Comm.,</i> 418 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir.2005) (en banc). The Supreme Court has recently emphasized the limits on facial challenges in the substantive due process context. <i>See </i><i>Gonzales v. Carhart,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1610, 1639, 167 L.Ed.2d 480 (2007).</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' facial challenge fails. <i>Lawrence</i> did not identify a protected liberty interest in all forms and manner of sexual intimacy. <i>Lawrence</i> recognized only a narrowly defined liberty interest in adult consensual sexual intimacy in the confines of one's home and one's own private life. <i>Lawrence,</i> 539 U.S. at 567, 123 S.Ct. 2472. The Court made it abundantly clear that there are many types of sexual activity that are beyond the reach of that opinion. <i>Id.,</i> at 578, 123 S.Ct. 2472. Here, the Act includes such other types of sexual activity. The Act provides for the separation of a service person who engages in a public homosexual act or who coerces another person to engage in a homosexual act. Both of these forms of conduct are expressly excluded from the liberty interest recognized by <i>Lawrence. Id.</i></p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' as-applied challenge, on the other hand, presents a more difficult question. The plaintiffs point out that the Act could apply to some conduct that falls within the zone of protected liberty identified by <i>Lawrence.</i> The Act, for example, could cover homosexual conduct occurring off base between two consenting adults in the privacy of their home.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> Before addressing the significance of this observation, we pause to recognize the unique context in which the liberty interest at stake in this case arises. We are reviewing an exercise of Congressional judgment in the area of military affairs. The deferential approach courts take when doing so is well-established. <i>Loving v. United States,</i> 517 U.S. 748, 768, 116 S.Ct. 1737, 135 L.Ed.2d 36 (1996) (noting that the Supreme Court gives Congress \"the highest deference\" in ordering military affairs) (citation omitted); <i>Weiss v. United States,</i> 510 U.S. 163, 177, 114 S.Ct. 752, 127 L.Ed.2d 1 (1994) (recognizing that the Supreme Court \"[adheres] to [the] principle of deference in a variety of contexts [such as] where the constitutional rights of servicemen [are] implicated\"); <i>Rostker v. Goldberg,</i> 453 U.S. 57, 70, 101 S.Ct. 2646, 69 L.Ed.2d 478 (1981) (\"[J]udicial deference... is at its apogee when legislative action under the congressional authority to raise and support armies and make rules and regulations for their governance is challenged.\").</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has articulated essentially two reasons for this deference. The first involves institutional competence. The Court has remarked:</p>\n<blockquote>It is difficult to conceive of an area of governmental activity in which courts have less competence. The complex, subtle, and professional decisions as to the composition, training, equipping and control of a military force are essentially professional military judgments, subject always to civilian control of the Legislative and Executive Branches.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Gilligan v. Morgan,</i> 413 U.S. 1, 10, 93 S.Ct. 2440, 37 L.Ed.2d 407 (1973); <i>see also </i><i>N.D. v. United States,</i> 495 U.S. 423, 443, 110 S.Ct. 1986, 109 L.Ed.2d 420 (1990) (noting that where confronted with questions relating to military operations the Court \"properly defer[s] to the judgment of those who must lead our Armed Forces in battle\").</p>\n<p>The second relates to the constitutional power of Congress to \"raise and support armies and to make all laws necessary and proper to that end.\" <i>United States v. O'Brien,</i> 391 U.S. 367, 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968). The Court has described this power as \"broad and sweeping,\" <i>id.,</i> and has further noted Congress' accompanying responsibility for \"the delicate task of balancing the rights of servicemen against the needs of the military.\" <i>Solorio v. United States,</i> 483 U.S. 435, 447, 107 S.Ct. 2924, 97 L.Ed.2d 364 (1987).</p>\n<p>It is unquestionable that judicial deference to congressional decision-making in the area of military affairs heavily influences the analysis and resolution of constitutional challenges that arise in this context. The Court's examination of the equal protection challenge leveled in <i>Rostker</i> provides an example. That case concerned a statute that required only males to register for selective service. The lower court had invalidated the statute as unlawful gender discrimination. 453 U.S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> at 63, 101 S.Ct. 2646. In reversing, the Court focused its analysis entirely on the legislative record that led to Congress' action. The Court discussed, in detail, the process Congress employed in considering the issue, its consultation with all interested parties, its serious consideration of the issues, including the constitutional implications, and its clear articulation of the basis for its decision. <i>Id.</i> at 72-80, 101 S.Ct. 2646. The Court then declared the district court's analysis striking down the law \"quite wrong\" because the district court undertook \"an independent evaluation of evidence rather than adopting an appropriately deferential examination of Congress' evaluation of the evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 82-83, 101 S.Ct. 2646.</p>\n<p>The Court's treatment of First Amendment and Due Process challenges brought in this area similarly manifests this deference to congressional judgment. In <i>Parker v. Levy,</i> 417 U.S. 733, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974), a case involving vagueness and overbreadth challenges to provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the Court stated that \"Congress is permitted to legislate both with greater breadth and with greater flexibility when the statute governs military society.\" <i>Id.</i> at 755, 94 S.Ct. 2547. In <i>Weiss,</i> the Court reemphasized that when dealing with due process challenges \"the tests and limitations [associated with those challenges] may differ because of the military context.\" 510 U.S. at 177, 114 S.Ct. 752 (citing <i>Rostker,</i> 453 U.S. at 67, 101 S.Ct. 2646).<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Fully apprised of the constraints on our constitutional inquiry when considering constitutional challenges in the military context, we now examine both the process by which Congress passed the Act and the rationale Congress advanced for it.</p>\n<p>Congress' process for developing the Act was involved and it included sustained consideration of the Act's necessity and its impact on constitutional rights. After President Clinton was inaugurated, he directed the Secretary of Defense to submit a draft Executive Order \"ending discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in determining who may serve in the Armed Services.\" Memorandum on Ending Discrimination in the Armed Forces, 1 Pub. Papers 23 (Jan. 29, 1993). The President instructed the Secretary to consult with the military's professional leadership and others concerned with the issue. <i>Id.</i> While this review was in progress, an interim policy was imposed that ended the practice of asking new recruits to confirm that they were heterosexual.</p>\n<p>Congress quickly intervened. A few weeks after President Clinton was sworn in, Congress passed a provision calling for a review of the military's approach to homosexuals serving in the military by the Secretary of Defense and the Senate Armed Services Committee. <i>See</i> Pub.L. 103-3 § 601, 107 Stat. 6, 28-29 (1993).</p>\n<p>Subsequently, the Department and congressional committees engaged in an exhaustive policy review. The Senate and House Armed Services Committees conducted fourteen days of hearings, heard more than fifty witnesses, and traveled to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> military facilities to investigate the issue. The Committees heard from witnesses with a wide range of views and various backgrounds, including the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, military and legal experts, enlisted personnel, officers, and public policy activists. <i>See Assessment of the Plan to Lift the Ban on Homosexuals in the Military: Hearings Before the Military Forces and Personnel Subcomm. of the House Comm. on Armed Services,</i> 103 Cong., 1st Sess. (1993); <i>Policy Concerning Homosexuality in the Armed Forces: Hearings Before the Senate Comm. on Armed Services,</i> 103 Cong., 1st Sess. (1993); <i>Policy Implications of Lifting the Ban on Homosexuals in the Military: Hearings Before the House Comm. on Armed Servs.,</i> 103 Cong., 1st Sess. (1993).</p>\n<p>While this congressional review was ongoing, the Department conducted its own review. The Department convened a military working group comprised of senior officers, commissioned a RAND Corporation study, studied the history of the military's response to social change, and consulted legal experts.</p>\n<p>In July 1993, President Clinton announced a new policy for the service of homosexuals in the military. Under the policy, applicants for military service would not be asked their sexual orientation but, once inducted into service, a member could be separated for homosexual conduct. 1 Pub. Papers 1111 (July 19, 1993).</p>\n<p>A few weeks after the President's announcement, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees proposed to codify the military's policy. The Senate Report, in support of this effort, stated that the Committee was acting only after it had considered \"a wide range of experiences, including those of current and former servicemembers who have publicly identified themselves as gay or lesbian\" and after having \"carefully considered all points of view.\" S. Rep. 103-112 at 270. Similarly, the House Committee reported that its recommendation was based on \"an extensive hearing record as well as full consideration of the extended public debate on this issue ...\" H.R. Rep. 103-200 at 287 (1993) <i>reprinted in</i> 1993 <i>U.S.C.C.A.N</i> 2073 at 2074. The Senate Report also focused explicitly on the effect that the Act could have on constitutional rights of homosexuals, concluding that \"if the Supreme Court should reverse its ruling in <i>Bowers</i> and hold that private consensual homosexual acts between adults may not be prosecuted in civilian society, this would not alter the committee's judgment as to the effect of homosexual conduct in the armed forces.\" S. Rep. 103-112 at 287.</p>\n<p>Prior to the enactment of the Act, the full House and Senate debated the measure and considered floor amendments. In particular, each house rejected amendments that would have permitted the military to develop whatever policy it deemed appropriate and would have allowed the Department to resume asking applicants to state their sexual orientation. 139 Cong. Rec. S11168-11228 (Sept. 9, 1993); 139 Cong. Rec. H7084-86 (Sept. 29, 1993). The Act became law in November 1993, and, as stated earlier, the Act expressly identified its purpose as preserving \"high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion\" in the military. 10 U.S.C. § 654(a)(15).</p>\n<p>The circumstances surrounding the Act's passage lead to the firm conclusion that Congress and the Executive studied the issues intensely and from many angles, including by considering the constitutional rights of gay and lesbian service members. S. Rep. 103-112 at 286-87. Congress ultimately concluded that the voluminous evidentiary record supported adopting a policy of separating certain homosexuals from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> military service to preserve the \"high morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion\" of the troops.</p>\n<p>Acknowledging the government interest identified in this case, one that our deferential posture requires us to take at face value, as-applied challenges to the Act must fail as well.</p>\n<p>Here, as in <i>Rostker,</i> there is a detailed legislative record concerning Congress' reasons for passing the Act. This record makes plain that Congress concluded, after considered deliberation, that the Act was necessary to preserve the military's effectiveness as a fighting force, 10 U.S.C. § 654(a)(15), and thus, to ensure national security. This is an exceedingly weighty interest and one that unquestionably surpasses the government interest that was at stake in <i>Lawrence. See </i><i>Lawrence,</i> 539 U.S. at 585, 123 S.Ct. 2472 (O'Connor, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Every as-applied challenge brought by a member of the armed forces against the Act, at its core, implicates this interest. Every member of the armed forces has one fact in common  at a moment's notice he or she may be deployed to a combat area. 10 U.S.C. § 654(a)(11). The conditions of service in such an area bring into play the animating concerns behind the Act, namely, maintaining the morale and unit cohesion that the military deems essential to an effective fighting force. <i>See</i> 10 U.S.C § 654(a)(12), (15). Accordingly, we have no choice but to dismiss the plaintiffs' as-applied challenge.</p>\n<p>To be sure, deference to Congressional judgment in this area does not mean abdication. <i>Rostker,</i> 453 U.S. at 67, 101 S.Ct. 2646. But where Congress has articulated a substantial government interest for a law, and where the challenges in question implicate that interest, judicial intrusion is simply not warranted. <i>See id.</i> at 68, 101 S.Ct. 2646 (\"[W]e must be particularly careful not to substitute our judgment of what is desirable for that of Congress, or our own evaluation of evidence for a reasonable evaluation by the Legislative Branch.\").<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Equal Protection</h2>\n<p>In addition to their due process claim, the plaintiffs assert that the Act is unconstitutional under equal protection principles.<sup>[11]</sup> Unlike the due process claim, which is premised on the constitutional protection afforded all citizens to engage in certain sexual conduct, the equal protection claim is based on the Act's differential treatment of homosexual military members versus heterosexual military members. <i>See generally</i> Erwin Chemerinsky, <i>Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies</i> § 10.1.1 (2d Ed.2002) (explaining the difference between a due process and an equal protection challenge). The district court rejected this claim under rational basis review.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> Under equal protection jurisprudence, a governmental classification aimed at a \"suspect class\" is subject to heightened judicial scrutiny. <i>See </i><i>Mills v. State of Me.,</i> 118 F.3d 37, 46 (1st Cir.1997). Classifications that target non-suspect classes are subject only to rational basis review. <i>Id.</i> The plaintiffs contend that the district court erred by applying rational basis review because the Supreme Court's decisions in <i>Romer v. Evans,</i> 517 U.S. 620, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996), and <i>Lawrence</i> mandate a more demanding standard.</p>\n<p>In <i>Romer,</i> the Supreme Court invalidated, on equal protection grounds, a Colorado constitutional amendment which prohibited the enactment of any measure designed to protect individuals due to their sexual orientation. The Court analyzed the constitutionality of the amendment through the prism of rational basis, asking whether the classification bore \"a rational relation to some legitimate end.\" <i>Id.</i> at 631, 116 S.Ct. 1620. Applying this standard, the Court concluded that the amendment was unconstitutional because the only possible justification for the amendment was \"animosity toward the class of persons affected,\" which does not constitute even \"a legitimate governmental interest.\" <i>Id.</i> at 634-35, 116 S.Ct. 1620.</p>\n<p><i>Romer,</i> by its own terms, applied rational basis review. The ground for decision was the notion that where \"a law is challenged as a denial of equal protection, and all that the government can come up with in defense of the law is that the people who are hurt by it happen to be irrationally hated or irrationally feared, . . . it is difficult to argue that the law is rational if 'rational' in this setting is to mean anything more than democratic preference.\" <i>Milner v. Apfel,</i> 148 F.3d 812, 817 (7th Cir.1998) (Posner, J.). <i>Romer</i> nowhere suggested that the Court recognized a new suspect class. Absent additional guidance from the Supreme Court, we join our sister circuits in declining to read <i>Romer</i> as recognizing homosexuals as a suspect class for equal protection purposes. <i>Scarbrough v. Morgan County Bd. of Ed.,</i> 470 F.3d 250, 261 (6th Cir.2006); <i>Citizens for Equal Prot. v. Bruning,</i> 455 F.3d 859, 866 (8th Cir.2006); <i>Johnson v. Johnson,</i> 385 F.3d 503, 532 (5th Cir.2004); <i>Lofton,</i> 358 F.3d at 818; <i>Veney v. Wyche,</i> 293 F.3d 726, 731-32 (4th Cir.2002); <i>Holmes,</i> 124 F.3d at 1132.</p>\n<p><i>Lawrence</i> does not alter this conclusion. As discussed earlier, <i>Lawrence</i> was a substantive due process decision that recognized a right in all adults, regardless of sexual orientation, to engage in certain intimate conduct. Indeed, the <i>Lawrence</i> Court explicitly declined to base its ruling on equal protection principles, even though that issue was presented. <i>See </i><i>Lawrence,</i> 539 U.S. at 574-75, 123 S.Ct. 2472. Thus, there is no basis for arguing that <i>Lawrence</i> changed the standard of review applicable to a legislative classification based on sexual orientation.</p>\n<p>As neither <i>Romer</i> nor <i>Lawrence</i> mandate heightened scrutiny of the Act because of its classification of homosexuals, the district court was correct to analyze the plaintiffs' equal protection claim under the rational basis standard. As stated earlier, an enactment survives this level of scrutiny so long as the \"classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\" <i>City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr.,</i> 473 U.S. 432, 440, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985).</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs maintain that, even under this standard, their claim survives because they will be able to demonstrate that the Act was based on irrational animus and therefore is invalid under <i>Romer.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> We disagree. Congress has put forward a non-animus based explanation for its decision to pass the Act. Given the substantial deference owed Congress' assessment of the need for the legislation, the Act survives rational basis review.<sup>[12]</sup><i>Able,</i> 155 F.3d at 635-36; <i>Holmes,</i> 124 F.3d at 1132-40; <i>Richenberg,</i> 97 F.3d at 262; <i>Thomasson,</i> 80 F.3d at 929.</p>\n<p>In sum, the district court was correct to reject the plaintiffs' equal protection claim because homosexuals are not a suspect class and the legitimate interests Congress put forward are rationally served by the Act.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. First Amendment</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs' final challenge attacks the portion of the Act that subjects a member to possible separation for making a statement identifying himself or herself as a homosexual. The plaintiffs assert that they have adequately stated a claim that this aspect of the Act violates the First Amendment because it subjects a member to separation for stating his or her sexual identity.<sup>[13]</sup> The plaintiffs maintain that this aspect of the Act is invalid because it restricts the content of the plaintiffs' speech and forces them to pretend that they are heterosexual.</p>\n<p>There is no question that members of the military are engaging in speech when they state their sexual orientation. <i>See </i><i>Hurley v. Irish-American Gay &amp; Lesbian &amp; Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.,</i> 515 U.S. 557, 574-75, 115 S.Ct. 2338, 132 L.Ed.2d 487 (1995). There is also no question that First Amendment protections apply to some degree in the military context. <i>See </i><i>Goldman,</i> 475 U.S. at 503, 106 S.Ct. 1310. But \"our review of military regulations challenged on First Amendment grounds is far more deferential than constitutional review of similar laws or regulations designed for civilian society.\" <i>Id.</i> This limitation is rooted in the recognition that free expression can sometimes conflict with the military's compelling need to \"foster instinctive obedience, unity, commitment, and espirit de corps\" and that \"the essence of military service is the subordination of the desires and interests of the individual to the needs of service.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The Act does affect the right of military members to express their sexual orientation by establishing the possibility of adverse consequences from announcing their sexual orientation. But the Act's purpose is not to restrict this kind of speech. Its purpose is to identify those who have engaged or are likely to engage in a homosexual act as defined by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> statute. The law is thus aimed at eliminating certain conduct or the possibility of certain conduct from occurring in the military environment, not at restricting speech. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Philips v. Perry,</i> 106 F.3d 1420, 1430 (9th Cir.1997); <i>Thomasson,</i> 80 F.3d at 931. The Act relies on a member's speech only because a member's statement that he or she is homosexual will often correlate with a member who has a propensity to engage in a homosexual act.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment \"does not prohibit the evidentiary use of speech to establish\" a claim \"or to prove motive or intent.\" <i>Wisconsin v. Mitchell,</i> 508 U.S. 476, 489, 113 S.Ct. 2194, 124 L.Ed.2d 436 (1993); <i>see also </i><i>Wayte v. United States,</i> 470 U.S. 598, 612, 105 S.Ct. 1524, 84 L.Ed.2d 547 (1985). As the Fourth Circuit explained in rejecting a challenge identical to the one presented here:</p>\n<blockquote>There is no constitutional impediment,. . . to the use of speech as relevant evidence of facts that may furnish a permissible basis for separation from military service. No First Amendment concern would arise, for instance, from the discharge of service members for declaring that they would refuse to follow orders, or that they were addicted to controlled substances. Such remarks provide evidence of activity that the military may validly proscribe.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Thomasson,</i> 80 F.3d at 931.</p>\n<p>We think that the Fourth Circuit has correctly analyzed this claim. To the extent that the Act may be constitutionally applied to circumscribe sexual conduct, the First Amendment does not bar the military from using a member's declaration of homosexuality as evidence of a violation of the Act. We therefore join the other courts that have rejected First Amendment challenges to the Act on this basis. <i>See </i><i>Holmes,</i> 124 F.3d at 1136; <i>Able,</i> 88 F.3d at 1300; <i>Thomasson,</i> 80 F.3d at 931.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs argue that, after <i>Lawrence,</i> this analysis is \"outmoded.\" We disagree. The Act does not punish a member for making a statement regarding sexual orientation; separation from service is mandated only because a member has engaged, intends to engage or has a propensity to engage in a homosexual act. This is still a question concerning conduct (or likely conduct); the member's speech continues to have only evidentiary significance in making this conduct-focused determination.</p>\n<p>Citing <i>Dawson v. Delaware,</i> 503 U.S. 159, 112 S.Ct. 1093, 117 L.Ed.2d 309 (1992), the plaintiffs also argue that the First Amendment nevertheless limits the kinds of statements that may be used by the government as evidence in an adversary proceeding. In <i>Dawson,</i> the Supreme Court held that the defendant's membership in a white supremacist group could not be introduced against him in a capital sentencing hearing because it violated the defendant's First Amendment right to associate. <i>Id.</i> at 166-68, 112 S.Ct. 1093. In reaching this conclusion, the Court emphasized that the admission violated the First Amendment because it had \"no bearing on the issue being tried.\" <i>Id.</i> No similar claim can be made here. A statement by a member that he or she is homosexual is undoubtedly relevant to the kind of conduct a member intends to engage in or has a propensity to engage in. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Simkanin,</i> 420 F.3d 397, 417-18 (5th Cir.2005) (concluding that <i>Dawson</i> did not apply where the defendant's statement was relevant to the issues at sentencing). Therefore, <i>Dawson</i> is inapposite.</p>\n<p>Finally, plaintiffs argue that the Act's rebuttable presumption violates their First Amendment rights. The Act's rebuttable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> presumption works as follows. A military member may be separated from the armed forces if,</p>\n<blockquote>the member has stated that he or she is a homosexual or bisexual, or words to that effect, <i>unless</i> there is a further finding, made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in the regulations, that the member has demonstrated that he or she is not a person who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.</blockquote>\n<p>10 U.S.C. § 654(b)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' attack on the rebuttable presumption is twofold. First, they claim that for homosexual military members, the rebuttable presumption is functionally impossible to rebut. Because they are homosexual within the meaning of section 654(f)(1), they cannot prove that they are not homosexual as section 654(b)(2) effectively requires. Second, the plaintiffs argue that even if section 654(b)(2) <i>did</i> offer a presumption capable of being rebutted by homosexual members, the existence of such a presumption \"would still force [them] and other gay and lesbian service members to live in an environment that severely restricts and chills constitutionally protected speech.\" We deal with each contention in turn.</p>\n<p>Each plaintiff has agreed that he or she is a person who \"engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.\" 10 U.S.C. § 654(f)(1). Because they admit they fall within section 654(f)(1)'s definition of homosexual, none of them could have proved at a separation proceeding that she or he was not a person who \"engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in\" prohibited conduct because, by definition, they are such a person. <i>See id.</i> In that sense, for a military member who is homosexual as defined by 654(f)(1), the rebuttable presumption would be functionally impossible to rebut.</p>\n<p>But that does not mean the Act violates the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights. As noted earlier, the government may use a member's statement that he or she is a homosexual as evidence that he or she \"engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.\" If a person cannot show otherwise, because in fact he or she does engage in or have such a propensity to engage in homosexual conduct, then the military is entitled to separate that person from the service. The military, in that scenario, is not punishing speech but conduct or propensity to engage in conduct.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the contention that it is functionally impossible for a gay member to say \"I am homosexual\" and then rebut the presumption according to the terms of section 654(b)(2) is inaccurate on its face. A member's personal definition of \"homosexuality\" may not be coextensive with the Act's. For example, a person may say he or she is homosexual even though the person does not engage in, attempt to engage in, have a propensity to engage in, or intend to engage in homosexual acts. In that scenario, there is a meaningful opportunity to rebut the presumption. The Ninth Circuit's opinion in <i>Holmes</i> provides examples.</p>\n<blockquote>One female Naval officer admitted to her homosexuality but submitted a statement, in which she stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that she understands the rules against homosexual conduct and intended to obey those rules. Another female Naval officer stated that she was a lesbian but that the statement `in no way, was meant to imply [ ] any propensity or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> intent or desire to engage in prohibited conduct.'</blockquote>\n<p>124 F.3d at 1136.</p>\n<p>Of course, a situation may arise where a gay member triggers the rebuttable presumption by stating he is gay, proves he is not a person who \"engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts,\" and yet is still separated from service. This member would have an administrative challenge available to him. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. § 701. No facts have been plead suggesting such a scenario arose in this case.</p>\n<p>We now turn to the plaintiffs' alternative argument that the rebuttable presumption, even if capable of being rebutted by homosexual military members, chills their First Amendment rights. The plaintiffs suggest that the presumption is content based and thus unconstitutional. The Fourth Circuit rejected a similar argument in <i>Thomasson.</i> It observed:</p>\n<blockquote>Whenever a provision prohibits certain acts, it necessarily chills speech that constitutes evidence of the acts. A regulation directed at acts thus inevitably restricts a certain type of speech; this policy is no exception. But effects of this variety do not establish a content-based restriction of speech.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Thomasson,</i> 80 F.3d at 932.</p>\n<p>As we explained, the Act's purpose is not to restrict military members from expressing their sexual orientation. Its purpose is to identify those who have engaged in or are likely to engage in a homosexual act. The fact that the Act may, in operation, have the effect of chilling speech does not change the analysis. <i>See </i><i>Ward v. Rock Against Racism,</i> 491 U.S. 781, 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989) (noting that regulation is . . . content-neutral so long as it is \"`justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech'\" even if it has an \"effect on some speakers or messages but not others.\") (citation omitted); <i>City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.,</i> 475 U.S. 41, 47, 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed.2d 29 (1986). Ultimately, the Act is justified on a content-neutral, nonspeech basis; specifically, maintaining the military's effectiveness as a fighting force. \"That the policy may hinge the commencement of administrative proceedings on a particular type of statement does not convert it into a content based enactment.\" <i>Thomasson,</i> 80 F.3d at 933.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The constitutional challenges presented in this case are all aimed at a federal statute regulating military affairs. Although the wisdom behind the statute at issue here may be questioned by some, in light of the special deference we grant Congressional decision-making in this area we conclude that the challenges must be dismissed.</p>\n<p>We <i>affirm</i> the judgment of the district court. No costs are awarded.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p>SARIS, United States District Judge, concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p>I concur with the majority opinion regarding the application of <i>Lawrence</i> to the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" statute, 10 U.S.C. § 654 (the \"Act\"). I also concur with the majority's discussion of the plaintiffs' equal protection challenge. However, I respectfully dissent from the discussion of the plaintiffs' claim that 10 U.S.C. § 654(b)(2)<sup>[14]</sup> violates the First Amendment.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> The military calls the evidentiary presumption created by 10 U.S.C. § 654(b)(2) a \"rebuttable\" presumption. <i>See</i> Department of Defense (\"DoD\") Directive No. 1332.14 ¶ E3.A1.1.8.1.2.2 (amended 1994) (\"A statement by a Service member that he or she is a homosexual or bisexual, or words to that effect, creates a <i>rebuttable presumption</i> that the Service member engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.\") (emphasis added). Because the plaintiffs dispute that the presumption is rebuttable, I adopt the phrasing used by the Second Circuit, and call the presumption the \"statement presumption.\" <i>See </i><i>Able v. United States,</i> 88 F.3d 1280, 1283 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>The Claims</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that the statement presumption violates the First Amendment in two ways. <i>First,</i> they contend that the presumption is a dead letter in practice because, as applied, \"it is functionally impossible for a gay service member to say `I am gay' and then prove that he has no `propensity' to engage in homosexual activity, even if the service member could show a track record of celibacy and an honest intent to refrain from prohibited conduct.\" In the plaintiffs' view, the only way to avoid discharge is to recant their sexual orientation. As such, the statement presumption is allegedly used to punish plaintiffs' speech concerning their own status as homosexuals.</p>\n<p>Second, the plaintiffs argue that the statement presumption is an unconstitutional allocation of the burden of proof, which chills their own speech as well as a whole range of protected expression by both gay and straight service members. The plaintiffs argue that:</p>\n<blockquote>The provision's burden falls on any speaker whose \"[l]anguage or behavior\" suggests to \"a reasonable person\" that the person \"intended to convey\" that he or she is gay. This broad definition could chill a whole range of protected expression: A service member might wave a rainbow flag or wear a pink triangle, or he might state that he opposes \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\" Under § 654's burden-shifting mechanism, these possibilities and more could force the service memberwhether straight or gayinto discharge proceedings where he must prove that he has no propensity to engage in homosexual conduct.</blockquote>\n<p>(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Content Neutrality</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The starting point for the analysis is the difficult question of whether the statement presumption restricts speech based on its content or viewpoint. I ultimately agree with the majority's position that the statement presumption is content-neutral, but I believe that the issue is a much closer call.</p>\n<p>\"The First Amendment generally prevents government from proscribing speech, or even expressive conduct, because of disapproval of the ideas expressed. Content-based regulations are presumptively invalid.\" <i>R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul,</i> 505 U.S. 377, 382, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992) (citations omitted). A content-based restriction \"can stand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny,\" and thus <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> is only constitutional if it is \"narrowly tailored to promote a compelling Government interest.\" <i>United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc.,</i> 529 U.S. 803, 813, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 146 L.Ed.2d 865 (2000).</p>\n<p>However, \"[a] restriction that on its face appears to be content-based, yet serves another purpose that by itself is not speech restrictive, may be constitutionally permitted.\" <i>Able,</i> 88 F.3d at 1294. Where a restriction does not \"fit neatly into either the `content-based' or `content-neutral' category,\" the Supreme Court has held that the speech restriction is content-neutral so long as it is \"<i>justified</i> without reference to the content of the regulated speech.\" <i>City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.,</i> 475 U.S. 41, 47-48, 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed.2d 29 (1986) (finding zoning ordinance that limits placement of adult theaters content-neutral because it was \"aimed not at the <i>content</i> of the films shown . . . but rather at the <i>secondary effects</i> of such theaters on the surrounding community\") (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>Even a content-neutral statute, though, must pass First Amendment muster. A content-neutral regulation is permissible:</p>\n<blockquote>[1] if it is within the constitutional power of the Government;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[2] if it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[3] if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[4] if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Wayte v. United States,</i> 470 U.S. 598, 611, 105 S.Ct. 1524, 84 L.Ed.2d 547 (1985) (quoting <i>United States v. O'Brien,</i> 391 U.S. 367, 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968)).</p>\n<p>The four circuits that addressed the constitutionality of the Act soon after its passage (and before <i>Lawrence</i>)<sup>[15]</sup> rejected First Amendment challenges to the statement presumption, but they did not fully agree on the appropriate categorization of the First Amendment restriction. In <i>Thomasson v. Perry,</i> 80 F.3d 915 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc), involving a First Amendment challenge to the Act both on its face and as-applied, the Fourth Circuit rejected an argument that the statement presumption suppressed speech on the basis of its content and viewpoint, holding:</p>\n<blockquote>The statute does not target speech declaring homosexuality; rather it targets homosexual acts and the propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts, and permissibly uses the speech as evidence. The use of speech as evidence in this manner does not raise a constitutional issue\"the First Amendment . . . does not prohibit the evidentiary use of speech to establish the elements of a crime,\" or, as is the case here, \"to prove motive or intent.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 931 (quoting <i>Wisconsin v. Mitchell,</i> 508 U.S. 476, 489, 113 S.Ct. 2194, 124 L.Ed.2d 436 (1993)). The Fourth Circuit pointed out that service members subject to proceedings under the statement presumption have, in the past, \"successfully demonstrated that they lack a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 932. The Fourth Circuit relied on opinions from two district courts to demonstrate that some service members had successfully rebutted the presumption of propensity. <i>See </i><i>Richenberg v. Perry,</i> 909 F.Supp. 1303, 1313 (D.Neb.1995) (noting that seven service members have successfully rebutted the presumption but not describing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> the evidence presented), <i>aff'd,</i> 97 F.3d 256 (8th Cir.1996); <i>Able v. United States,</i> 880 F.Supp. 968, 976 (E.D.N.Y. 1995) (identifying three instances where Navy members had been able to escape discharge, but concluding that these instances were \"obviously aberrations that cannot be taken to show that the Act holds out any realistic opportunity to rebut the presumption\"), <i>vacated,</i> 88 F.3d 1280, 1298 (2d Cir.1996) (rejecting the district court's characterization of these cases as \"aberrations\" and stating instead that \"they demonstrate that the admission of homosexual status does not inevitably equate with a finding of propensity to engage in homosexual acts\").</p>\n<p>Two circuits similarly held that the Act and its implementing DoD Directives do not target mere status or speech, but seek to identify and exclude those who are likely to engage in homosexual acts. <i>See </i><i>Richenberg v. Perry,</i> 97 F.3d 256, 263 (8th Cir.1996) (agreeing with <i>Thomasson</i>); <i>Holmes v. Cal. Army Nat'l Guard,</i> 124 F.3d 1126, 1136 (9th Cir.1997) (holding <i>brevis</i> that the statement presumption does not violate the First Amendment because the service members were discharged for their conduct and not for their speech).</p>\n<p>In a thoughtful opinion, the Second Circuit in <i>Able v. United States,</i> 88 F.3d 1280 (2d Cir.1996), addressed a facial challenge to the statement presumption claiming that it violated the First Amendment. Assuming, without deciding, that separation of a service member based on status alone would be unconstitutional, <i>id.</i> at 1297 n. 10, the Second Circuit discussed whether the statement presumption was content-neutral or content-based. <i>Id.</i> at 1294-96. The court never opted for one label or the other, holding instead that the statement presumption passed constitutional muster under both standards. <i>Id.</i> at 1295-96. The court emphasized that, under <i>United States v. Salerno,</i> 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987), the plaintiffs failed to show that \"no matter how the Act [was] read, it punish[ed] status not conduct.\" <i>Able,</i> 88 F.3d at 1297. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote>Contrary to the district court, we do not believe that, in the context of a facial challenge, we may conclude that the Act equates status with propensity. To be sure, in most cases a member who admits to a homosexual orientation will eventually be separated from the armed forces. But that is because the evidentiary value of the admission is strongly linked to what it is used to prove: a likelihood of engaging in homosexual acts. The plaintiffs cannot prove and the district court cannot credibly maintain that there are no instances in which a person will be retained, despite admitting to a homosexual status, because there is no likelihood that he will engage in such acts. The Directives promulgated by the DoD in accordance with the Act specifically contemplate that such an event may occur. <i>See</i> DoD Directive No. 1332.14, encl. 3, pt. 1, at H.1.b(2).</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 1298.</p>\n<p>As the Supreme Court has held, when it is not clear whether a restriction is content-based or content-neutral, the controlling consideration is the governmental purpose in enacting the legislation. <i>Renton,</i> 475 U.S. at 48, 106 S.Ct. 925; <i>see also </i><i>Ward v. Rock Against Racism,</i> 491 U.S. 781, 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989). Here, the government insists that the purpose of the Act is to target conduct, not status, and points to DoD Directives that limit the Act to only those who engage in or are likely to engage in homosexual conduct. <i>See</i> DoD Directive No. 1332.14 ¶ E2.1.10 (defining \"propensity to engage in homosexual acts\" to mean \"more than an abstract preference or desire to engage <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> in homosexual acts; it indicates a <i>likelihood</i> that a person engages in or will engage in homosexual acts\") (emphasis added); <i>see also id.</i> at ¶ E3.A1.1.8.1.2.2 (same). In response, the plaintiffs point to the plain terms of the statute, and also to a regulation that states that the statement presumption encompasses \"[l]anguage or behavior that a reasonable person would believe was intended to convey the statement that a person engages in, attempts to engage in, or has a propensity to engage in homosexual acts.\" <i>Id.</i> at ¶ E2.1.16. According to plaintiffs, given the vagueness of the term \"propensity,\" the statement presumption can be interpreted to reach expressions of mere homosexual status.</p>\n<p>While the question is close, I conclude that the statement presumption is better viewed as content-neutral because its primary purpose, as set forth by the government, is to target conduct, not speech. <i>But see </i><i>Thomasson,</i> 80 F.3d at 934 (Luttig, J., concurring) (agreeing with plaintiff that the purpose of Congress in passing the Act was to mandate exclusion of all known homosexuals based on their orientation or status \"regardless of whether they have actually engaged in homosexual conduct or are likely to engage in any such conduct\").</p>\n<p>Thus, under the standard that applies to content-neutral restrictions on speech, the critical remaining inquiries are \"(1) whether the statement[] presumption furthers a substantial governmental interest, and (2) whether the statement[] presumption restricts the plaintiffs' speech <i>no more than is essential.</i>\" <i>Able,</i> 88 F.3d at 1295 (emphasis added). For the reasons stated by the majority opinion with respect to the plaintiffs' other constitutional claims, the answer to the first of these inquiries is \"yes.\" Accordingly, I now turn to the question of whether the statement presumption, as applied, is overly restrictive of the plaintiffs' speech.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Dead Letter</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Undaunted by pre-<i>Lawrence</i> case law, the plaintiffs, who all admit they are homosexual within the meaning of Section 654(f)(1),<sup>[16]</sup> argue that the statement presumption burdens speech more than is essential because, as applied, it is \"functionally impossible\" to rebut the presumption short of recanting one's status. As such, plaintiffs allege that the statement presumption punishes service members who speak about their constitutionally protected homosexual status by requiring their discharge.</p>\n<p>The government disagrees with plaintiffs' dead letter theory that the statement presumption is impossible to rebut in practice. The government points out that, although the Act broadly defines homosexual conduct to include a \"propensity to engage in\" homosexual conduct, 10 U.S.C. § 654(f)(1), the implementing DoD Directives narrowly interpret \"propensity to engage in\" homosexual conduct to mean \"more than an abstract preference or desire to engage in homosexual acts; it indicates a <i>likelihood</i> that a person engages in or will engage in homosexual acts.\" DoD Directive No. 1332.14 ¶ E2.1.10 (defining \"propensity\") (emphasis added); <i>see also</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> <i>id.</i> at ¶ E3.A1.1.8.1.2.2 (same). Accordingly, in the government's view, because a service member's personal definition of \"homosexuality\" may not coincide with the Act's definition, a service member may be able to successfully rebut the statement presumption if he can show that his statement \"I am gay\" is not indicative of a likelihood that the he will engage in proscribed homosexual conduct.</p>\n<p>As several courts have pointed out, the line between \"propensity\" and \"orientation\" is razor-thin at best. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Able,</i> 880 F.Supp. at 975 (characterizing the distinction between \"orientation\" and \"propensity\" as \"Orwellian\"); <i>Thomasson,</i> 80 F.3d at 941-42 n. 8 (Luttig, J., concurring) (\"I do not know what homosexual orientation is, if it is not the propensity to commit homosexual acts; indeed, I do not understand how one even knows that he has a homosexual orientation except by realizing that he has a propensity toward the commission of homosexual acts.\"). Emphasizing that \"propensity\" sweeps in everyone who is gay, plaintiffs allege that, in practice, gay and lesbian service members are routinely discharged despite evidence that there is no likelihood that they will engage in proscribed homosexual conduct while they are in military service. Accordingly, plaintiffs contend that any honest admission of a gay or lesbian service member's sexual orientation results in discharge.</p>\n<p>In my view, if the Act were applied to punish statements about one's status as a homosexual, it would constitute a content-based speech restriction subject to strict scrutiny. <i>See </i><i>Meinhold v. U.S. Dep't of Def.,</i> 34 F.3d 1469, 1476-80 (9th Cir.1994) (in an equal protection challenge to the military's pre-\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" homosexuality policy, construing the policy as only applying to conduct in order to avoid constitutional concerns that would arise if the policy punished service members for \"mere propensity\" or status alone) (quoting <i>Powell v. Texas,</i> 392 U.S. 514, 543-44, 88 S.Ct. 2145, 20 L.Ed.2d 1254 (1968) (Black, J., concurring)). Indeed, as <i>Lawrence</i> articulates, \"Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct.\" <i>Lawrence v. Texas,</i> 539 U.S. 558, 562, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003); <i>see also </i><i>Whitney v. California,</i> 274 U.S. 357, 375, 47 S.Ct. 641, 71 L.Ed. 1095 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (stating that the founders \"believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth\").</p>\n<p>It is telling that the government does not contend it has a substantial interest, let alone a compelling one, in separating a service member because of his or her status as a homosexual. Rather, the government protests that it is not punishing homosexual status, and insists that it has an interest only in identifying and proscribing homosexual <i>conduct</i> to further its substantial interest in morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion.</p>\n<p>As proof that the statement presumption is in fact rebuttable, the government highlights opinions, in particular <i>Able</i> and <i>Holmes,</i> that have found that the statement presumption has been successfully rebutted in the past. <i>See </i><i>Able,</i> 88 F.3d at 1298 (\"[A]s the government represented at oral argument without contradiction, in seven cases (out of forty-three attempts), service members have been able to rebut the presumption created by their admission and have been retained.\"); <i>Holmes,</i> 124 F.3d at 1136 (pointing to several cases, including one where a \"female Naval officer admitted to her homosexuality but submitted a statement, in which she stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that she understands the rules against homosexual conduct and intended <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> to obey those rules.\"). However, in <i>Able,</i> the fact that some service members were successful was held to be sufficient to defeat a <i>facial</i> assault on the statute under the <i>Salerno</i> standard. <i>See </i><i>Able,</i> 88 F.3d at 1297-98 (\"Because plaintiffs have mounted a facial challenge to the Act, they must show that, no matter how the Act is read, it punishes status and not conduct.\") (citing <i>Salerno,</i> 481 U.S. at 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095). Here, in contrast to <i>Able,</i> plaintiffs mount an as-applied challenge by alleging the presumption is now functionally impossible to rebut short of recanting. Although the government points to cases of the statement presumption being successfully rebutted, the cherry-picked examples are all well over twelve years old: In fact, some 11,000 service members have been discharged under the Act since 1993. On a motion to dismiss, a court \"must accept as true all the factual allegations in the complaint,\" <i>Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence &amp; Coordination Unit,</i> 507 U.S. 163, 164, 113 S.Ct. 1160, 122 L.Ed.2d 517 (1993); <i>accord </i><i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (a court must assume \"that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)\"), and a court must make all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs' favor. <i>Clark v. Boscher,</i> 514 F.3d 107, 112 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Finally, the government argues that even if the statement presumption is a dead letter in practice, any misapplication of the presumption can be cured by the availability of administrative review. It may be true that an individual service member may prevail in rebutting the presumption on administrative review short of recanting his status, by stating, for example, that he will refrain from engaging in prohibited homosexual conduct. However, the availability of an administrative remedy does not defeat a First Amendment claim that the government is systematically applying the Act in such a way that it unconstitutionally burdens protected speech. <i>See </i><i>Califano v. Sanders,</i> 430 U.S. 99, 109, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977) (\"Constitutional questions obviously are unsuited to resolution in administrative hearing procedures.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Able,</i> 88 F.3d at 1289 (\"[B]ecause none of the administrative boards before which the plaintiffs would appear has the power to declare the Act unconstitutional, there is no realistic possibility that such proceedings would result in anything other than the plaintiffs' discharge.\").</p>\n<p>Accordingly, when all reasonable inferences are drawn in their favor, the plaintiffs have alleged a viable cause of action that the burden placed by the government on gay and lesbian service members' speech is \"greater than is essential\" to the government's interest in preventing the occurrence of homosexual acts in the military.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. <i>Chill</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs also argue that the statement presumption is an unconstitutional allocation of the burden of proof, which chills a whole range of protected expression.<sup>[17]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> The majority treats the plaintiffs' chill claim as an \"overbreadth\" claim, although only Appellant Pietrangelo describes the claim in those terms. This designation by the majority is understandable because plaintiffs are unclear as to whether this is a facial challenge, an as-applied challenge, or both.</p>\n<p>Because the plaintiffs have not expressly raised a facial challenge to the statement presumption, I will treat the claim as an as-applied challenge. The majority is correct to state that \"[n]one of the plaintiffs contend that they were separated from service because they participated in expressive activities.\" Op. at 62 n. 13. However, the core of the plaintiffs' as-applied challenge is that they were <i>chilled</i> from engaging in protected speech, not that they were punished for engaging in such speech.</p>\n<p>As a preliminary matter, the government has argued that this allocation-of-proof challenge to the statement presumption was not raised before the district court, and is therefore waived. While the plaintiffs raised a chilling argument before the district court, they did not raise this precise argument. However, in a First Amendment case, \"[o]nce a federal claim is properly presented, a party can make any argument in support of that claim; parties are not limited to the precise arguments they made below.\" <i>See </i><i>Lebron v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp.,</i> 513 U.S. 374, 379, 115 S.Ct. 961, 130 L.Ed.2d 902 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, in my view, in this case involving a First Amendment challenge, plaintiffs' argument that the statement presumption violates the First Amendment because it requires service members to rebut the presumption should not be deemed waived.</p>\n<p>The government contends that the DoD Directives and Issuances specifically carve out protected speech, quoting Directives and Issuances that show that the presumption is not triggered by rumors, suspicions, or capricious claims of others, <i>see</i> DoD Directive No. 1332.14 ¶ E3.A4.1.3.3, or by going to a gay or lesbian bar, possessing or reading homosexual publications, associating with gays and lesbians, or marching in a gay rights parade in civilian clothes. <i>See id.</i> ¶ E3.A4.1.3.3.4; <i>see also</i> S.Rep. No. 103-112, at 292 (1993) (\"What the policy recognizes is that heterosexuals, as well as homosexuals, might march in gay rights parades, frequent a gay bar, [and] read gay literature.\").</p>\n<p>Citing <i>Parker v. Levy,</i> 417 U.S. 733, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974), the government argues that the military's need for obedience and necessity \"may render permissible within the military that which would be constitutionally impermissible outside it.\" 417 U.S. at 758, 94 S.Ct. 2547 (affording deference to regulations applied to an Army doctor who protested Vietnam War and refused to obey orders on base). As the Supreme Court has held, its \"review of military regulations challenged on First Amendment grounds is far more deferential than constitutional review of similar laws or regulations designed for civilian society.\" <i>Goldman v. Weinberger,</i> 475 U.S. 503, 507, 106 S.Ct. 1310, 89 L.Ed.2d 478 (1986). Moreover, Congress is given the \"highest deference\" when legislating in the realm of military affairs. <i>Loving v. United States,</i> 517 U.S. 748, 768, 116 S.Ct. 1737, 135 L.Ed.2d 36 (1996); <i>see also </i><i>Solorio v. United States,</i> 483 U.S. 435, 447, 107 S.Ct. 2924, 97 L.Ed.2d 364 (1987) (noting that Congress has \"primary responsibility for the delicate task of balancing the rights <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> of servicemen against the needs of the military\").</p>\n<p>While judicial deference is \"at its apogee\" when legislative action regarding military affairs is challenged, \"deference does not mean abdication.\" <i>Rostker v. Goldberg,</i> 453 U.S. 57, 70, 101 S.Ct. 2646, 69 L.Ed.2d 478 (1981) (\"None of this is to say that Congress is free to disregard the Constitution when it acts in the area of military affairs.\"). The Supreme Court has struck down restrictions on speech imposed by Congress on First Amendment grounds, even when military matters were involved. <i>See </i><i>Schacht v. United States,</i> 398 U.S. 58, 60, 62-63, 90 S.Ct. 1555, 26 L.Ed.2d 44 (1970) (striking down a statutory restriction that allowed the wearing of military uniforms by actors in civilian theatrical productions only when such productions would not \"tend to discredit\" the military).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has afforded its strongest deference to the military for speech <i>in military settings. See, e.g., </i><i>Goldman,</i> 475 U.S. at 507-10, 106 S.Ct. 1310 (affording deference to regulation that prevented soldiers from wearing yarmulkes while on duty and in uniform); <i>Brown v. Glines,</i> 444 U.S. 348, 354-55, 100 S.Ct. 594, 62 L.Ed.2d 540 (1980) (affording deference to regulation that prevented soldiers from circulating petitions on air force bases). Even then, the deference is not absolute. In <i>Brown v. Glines</i><i>,</i> for example, the Court held that the limitations on on-base petitions \"restrict speech no more than is reasonably necessary\" because it allowed for alternative channels of protest, such as through the United States mail, and the regulations \"specifically prevent commanders from halting the distribution of materials that merely criticize the Government or its policies.\" 444 U.S. at 355, 100 S.Ct. 609.</p>\n<p>The most troubling aspect of the Act's statement presumption is that it covers purely private speech, and public speech made off base and off duty. By its own terms, the Act is \"pervasive\" in scope, applies \"24 hours [a] day,\" and applies even to speech made \"off base\" and/or \"off duty.\" <i>See</i> 10 U.S.C. §§ 654(a)(9)-(11). Thus, as alleged in the complaint, the Act required the discharge of some of the plaintiffs based upon strictly private speech, such as confiding in a friend or words within a letter from a friend or family member. In addition, the amicus brief submitted by the constitutional law professors cites the example of an Arizona state representative who spoke about his homosexuality on the floor of the legislature. After the military discovered the speech through an anonymous complaint and initiated discharge proceedings against the representative, he negotiated a voluntary separation from the Army. <i>See generally</i> Tobias Barrington Wolff, <i>Political Representation and Accountability Under Don't Ask, Don't Tell,</i> 89 Iowa L.Rev. 1633, 1644-50 (2004) (providing examples of the Act's statement presumption being applied to conversations with family members, sessions with chaplains and psychotherapists, and certain public statements).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that the statement presumption, as applied, chills speech because a service member will fear triggering a discharge proceeding, regardless of whether he or she could successfully rebut the presumption. As the Supreme Court explained when striking down a statement presumption in another context, \"[t]he man who knows that he must bring forth proof and persuade another of the lawfulness of his conduct necessarily must steer far wider of the unlawful zone than if the State must bear these burdens.\" <i>Speiser v. Randall,</i> 357 U.S. 513, 526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958) (in a due process challenge, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> invalidating a statute that conditioned a veteran's tax exemption on the signing of an oath disavowing the violent overthrow of the government and that established a rebuttable presumption against eligibility for the exemption if one failed to sign the oath); <i>see also </i><i>Smith v. California,</i> 361 U.S. 147, 150-51, 80 S.Ct. 215, 4 L.Ed.2d 205 (1939) (explaining that \"the allocation of the burden of proof,\" like many other legal devices that ordinarily pass constitutional muster, \"cannot be applied in settings where they have the collateral effect of inhibiting the freedom of expression, by making the individual the more reluctant to use it.\"). As alleged, the Act's statement presumption chills individual service members from discussing homosexuality both privately and publicly even when they have no intent to engage in prohibited homosexual conduct.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the plaintiffs' burden is a tough one in light of the strong deference owed to Congress and the military seeking to protect unit cohesion. Yet, when all reasonable inferences are drawn in their favor, plaintiffs have made sufficient allegations that the burden that the statement presumption places on speech is greater than is essential, particularly in nonmilitary settings off base and off duty. Thus, I believe that the motion to dismiss should be denied. Because the majority holds otherwise, I respectfully dissent in this very difficult case.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Pursuant to Rule 43(c)(2) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Robert M.

In <i>Witt,</i> the plaintiff argued that the Act violated substantive and procedural due process and the Equal Protection Clause. <i>See</i> <i>Id.</i> at ___-___, 2008 U.S.App. LEXIS 10794, at *1-2. The district court dismissed the suit under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <i>Id.</i> at ___, 2008 U.S.App. LEXIS 10794, at *2. The 9th Circuit reversed the district court's as applied due process rulings, remanding for further proceedings, and affirmed the court's dismissal of the plaintiff's Equal Protection claim. We agree with much of the reasoning set forth in that opinion but also part ways with the 9th Circuit's approach in some significant respects. Most importantly, for reasons that will become apparent, we resolve differently the as applied substantive due process claim brought in this case.

It concluded that, although the plaintiffs tried to plead as-applied challenges, the complaint failed to identify facts showing that the Act was \"misapplied\" in certain cases. We view differently the necessary factual predicate for an as-applied constitutional challenge to the Act. A claim that the Act was \"misapplied\" in a particular case is actionable, if at all, under the Administrative Procedures Act. <i>See </i><i>Richenberg v. Perry,</i> 97 F.3d 256, 263 (8th Cir.1996) (assuming that a review of separation decision under the Act is reviewable under the APA). But this is not the plaintiffs' claim. The plaintiffs allege that, even though the Act was properly administered according to its terms to separate each of them from service, the Act cannot be constitutionally applied in their particular cases because the application unconstitutionally infringes on their <i>Lawrence</i> interest. As-applied challenges \"`are the basic building blocks of constitutional adjudication'\" because they relieve the court of having \"to consider every conceivable situation which might possibly arise in the application of complex and comprehensive legislation.\" <i>Carhart,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 1639. A plaintiff asserts an as-applied challenge by claiming that a statute is unconstitutional as-applied to his or her particular conduct, even though the statute may be valid as to other parties. <i>See </i><i>Daggett v. Comm'n of Gov. Ethics &amp; Election Practices,</i> 205 F.3d 445, 472 (1st Cir.2000). The plaintiffs have pleaded classic as-applied challenges here because they claim that the Act is unconstitutional as applied to them, even though the Act may be constitutional as applied to others.</p>\n<p>[9]  Other examples of the deferential approach the Court has taken when analyzing constitutional challenges in the military context include: <i>Goldman v. Weinberger,</i> 475 U.S. 503, 508, 106 S.Ct. 1310, 89 L.Ed.2d 478 (1986) (free exercise of religion); <i>Chappell v. Wallace,</i> 462 U.S. 296, 300-05, 103 S.Ct. 2362, 76 L.Ed.2d 586 (1983) (racial discrimination); <i>Brown v. Glines,</i> 444 U.S. 348, 357-60, 100 S.Ct. 594, 62 L.Ed.2d 540 (1980) (free expression); <i>Middendorf v. Henry,</i> 425 U.S. 25, 43, 96 S.Ct. 1281, 47 L.Ed.2d 556 (1976) (right to counsel in summary court-martial proceeding). <i>Solorio,</i> 483 U.S. at 448, 107 S.Ct. 2924 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p>[10]  In <i>Witt,</i> the 9th Circuit resolved an as-applied, post-<i>Lawrence</i> substantive due process challenge to the Act differently then we do here. 527 F.3d at ___, 2008 U.S.App. LEXIS 10794, at *36. The 9th Circuit relied on the Supreme Court's pre-<i>Lawrence</i> decision in <i>Sell</i> as a touchstone for its due process inquiry. <i>Id.</i> at ___-___, 2008 U.S.App. LEXIS 10794, *29-30. Although we find <i>Sell</i> instructive in the sense that it illustrates the Supreme Court's application of an intermediate level of scrutiny, we do not find <i>Sell</i> especially helpful in analyzing this statute regulating military affairs.</p>\n<p>[11]  The Fifth Amendment does not contain an equal protection clause but the due process clause has been interpreted to include an equal protection component. <i>See </i><i>Bolling v. Sharpe,</i> 347 U.S. 497, 499, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954).</p>\n<p>[12]  The plaintiffs acknowledge that a conclusion that the Act survives rational basis review defeats their facial and as-applied equal protection challenges.</p>\n<p>[13]  For the first time on appeal, the plaintiffs contend that a wide variety of expressive activities could trigger discharge proceedings. They argue, \"A service member might wave a rainbow flag or wear a pink triangle, or he might state that he opposes `Don't Ask, Don't Tell.' Under § 654 . . . these possibilities and more could force the service member whether straight or gayinto discharge proceedings where he must prove that he has no propensity to engage in homosexual conduct.\" None of the plaintiffs contend that they were separated from service because they participated in expressive activities. Moreover, the explicit terms of the Act do not indicate that such activities could trigger separation proceedings and the government has stipulated they do not. DOD Directive 1332.414 § E3.A4; DOD Instruction 1332.40 § E8. In any event, we decline to reach this newly raised overbreadth argument on appeal. <i>See </i><i>Brown v. Hot, Sexy &amp; Safer Productions, Inc.,</i> 68 F.3d 525, 530 (1st Cir.1995) (stating that an appeal from a motion to dismiss \"is not an opportunity to conjure new arguments not raised before the district court.\").</p>\n<p>[14]  10 U.S.C. § 654(b)(2) provides, in relevant part, that:\n</p>\n<p>(b) A member of the armed forces shall be separated from the armed forces . . . if one or more of the following findings is made and approved . . .:</p>\n<p>(2) That the member has stated that he or she is a homosexual or bisexual, or words to that effect, unless there is a further finding, made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in the regulations, that the member has demonstrated that he or she is not a person who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.</p>\n<p>[15]  A recent post-<i>Lawrence</i> challenge to the statute did not include a First Amendment claim. <i>See </i><i>Witt v. Dep't of the Air Force,</i> 527 F.3d 806 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>[16]  As the majority correctly points out, \"[e]ach plaintiff has agreed that he or she is a person who `engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts,'\" as defined under the Act. Yet this concession by the plaintiffs does not end the matter because the plaintiffs also argue that the Act's definition of propensity improperly includes homosexual status. Thus, I do not understand the plaintiffs to be conceding that they could not have rebutted the statement presumption under § 654(b)(2) if, as the government maintains in defending the Act, \"propensity\" was limited to a likelihood of engaging in prohibited homosexual acts while a service member.</p>\n<p>[17]  A group of constitutional law professors submitted an amicus brief in support of this argument.

The Act, known as \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" provides for the separation of members of the military who engage, attempt to engage, intend to engage, or have a propensity to engage in a homosexual act. <i>Id.</i> § 654(b). In the aftermath of this congressional action, several members of the military brought constitutional challenges, claiming the Act violated the due process and equal protection components of the Fifth Amendment and the free speech clause of the First Amendment.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (2003). <i>Lawrence</i> has reinvigorated the debate over the Act's constitutionality. <i>E.g.,</i> Pamela Glazner, <i>Constitutional Doctrine Meets Reality: Don't Ask, Don't Tell in Light of Lawrence v. Texas,</i> 46 Santa Clara L.Rev. 635 (2006); Note, <i>The Military's Ban on Consensual Sodomy in a Post-Lawrence World,</i> 21 Wash. U.J.L. &amp; Pol'y 379 (2006); Jeffrey S. Dietz, <i>Getting Beyond Sodomy: Lawrence and Don't Ask, Don't Tell,</i> 2 Stan. J.C.R. &amp; C.L. 63 (2005). This case is the second post-<i>Lawrence</i> challenge to the Act to be decided by a federal court of appeals.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Statutory and Regulatory Scheme</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We begin by summarizing the statutory framework and the accompanying Department of Defense (Department) directives. During the 1992 campaign, President Clinton, preceding his first election, promised to revisit the longstanding Department policy of separating homosexual individuals from military service. After taking office, President Clinton directed the Secretary of Defense to review Department policy, and Congress undertook its own review.</p>\n<p>As part of the congressional review, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, in testimony explicitly adopted by the Senate Armed Services Committee, explained the rationale for the policy of separating certain homosexual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> members of the military from continued service:</p>\n<blockquote>It is very difficult in a military setting, where you don't get a choice of association, where you don't get a choice of where you live, to introduce a group of individuals who are proud, brave, loyal, good Americans, but who favor a homosexual lifestyle, and put them in with heterosexuals who would prefer not to have somebody of the same sex find them sexually attractive, put them in close proximity and ask them to share the most private facilities together, the bedroom, the barracks, latrines, and showers. I think that this is a very difficult problem to give the military. I think it would be prejudicial to good order and discipline to try to integrate that in the current military structure.</blockquote>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 103-112 at 283 (1993).</p>\n<p>Congress' review culminated in the passage of the Act. <i>See</i> National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Pub.L. No. 103-160, 107 Stat. 1547 § 571, <i>codified at</i> 10 U.S.C. § 654. The Act opens with a series of findings that echo General Powell's concerns: \"military life is fundamentally different from civilian life;\" \"[s]uccess in combat requires military units that are characterized by high morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion;\" and \"the presence in the armed forces of persons who demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability.\" <i>See</i> 10 U.S.C. § 654(a).</p>\n<p>To avoid the risk to unit cohesion created by the continued service of those who are likely to engage in a homosexual act, the Act provides that members of the military are subject to separation from service where one of three findings is made: (1) the member has engaged or attempted to engage in a homosexual act;<sup>[2]</sup> (2) the member has \"state[d] that he or she is a homosexual or words to that effect;\" or (3) the member has married or attempted to marry a person known to be of the same biological sex. <i>Id.</i> § 654(b).</p>\n<p>If a finding is made that a member of the military has engaged or attempted to engage in a homosexual act, the member may avoid separation by establishing that: (1) the conduct was a departure from the member's usual and customary behavior; (2) such conduct is unlikely to recur; (3) such conduct was not accomplished by use of force, coercion, or intimidation; (4) under the particular circumstances of the case, the member's continued presence in the military is consistent with the interests of the military in proper discipline, good order, and morale; and (5) the member does not have a propensity or intent to engage in a future homosexual act. <i>Id.</i> § 654(b)(1)(A)-(E). Similarly, a member found to have stated, in effect, that he or she is homosexual, may avoid separation by demonstrating \"that he or she is not a person who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in a homosexual act.\" <i>Id.</i> § 654(b)(2).</p>\n<p>Pursuant to authority granted by the Act, the Department issued directives for executing separation proceedings. The directives recite the three reasons under the Act for separation and provide that a member's statement that he or she is a homosexual \"creates a rebuttable presumption <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> that the [member] engages in, attempts to engage in, intends to engage in, or has a propensity to engage in a homosexual act.\" DOD Directive 1332.40 § E2.3 (1997). In considering whether a member has rebutted this presumption, the military considers: (1) whether the member has engaged in a homosexual act; (2) the member's credibility; (3) testimony from others about the member's past conduct; (4) the nature and circumstances of the member's statement; and (5) any other evidence relevant to whether the member is likely to engage in a homosexual act. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>The Complaint and Motion to Dismiss</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs are twelve former members of the United States military who were separated from service under the Act. The plaintiffs' complaint asserted the following claims: (1) the Act violates the plaintiffs' right to substantive due process on its face and as applied; (2) the Act denies the plaintiffs equal protection of the law on the basis of sexual orientation; and (3) the portion of the Act that triggers separation proceedings based on a member's statement that he or she is homosexual violates the right to freedom of speech.</p>\n<p>The government moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The government also contended that the plaintiffs' due process and equal protection claims failed because the Act was subject only to rational basis review, and Congress' \"unit cohesion\" justification sufficed to sustain the law under this standard as a matter of law. It also argued that the evidentiary use of a member's statement that he or she is homosexual to prove that the member has engaged, intends to engage, or has a propensity to engage in a homosexual act does not abridge First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>The District Court Opinion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court began its analysis by dispatching with the plaintiffs' as-applied due process challenges. <i>Cook v. Rumsfeld,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2487580\"><a href=\"/opinion/2487580/cook-v-rumsfeld/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2006). The court ruled that, while the complaint asserted that the plaintiffs were bringing as-applied challenges, in fact, they pleaded no such claims:</p>\n<blockquote>Although the complaint alleges that [the Act] is unconstitutional ... as it has been particularly applied to each of [the plaintiffs], their legal reasoning ... make[s] it clear that the constitutional defects they perceive inhere in any application of the policy to homosexual service members, rather than in the particular way the policy might be (or might have been) applied in specific cases. In other words, none of the plaintiffs claim that the policy, if valid in general, was <i>misapplied</i> in his or her particular case to result in separation when a proper application of the policy would have allowed him or her to remain in service. Rather, their objections... are <i>that</i> the policy was applied, not <i>how</i> it was applied. This is classically a facial challenge to the statute, and their arguments will be evaluated with that understanding.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 390 (emphases supplied).</p>\n<p>The district court then turned to the plaintiffs' facial challenges, beginning with the due process and equal protection claims. <i>Id.</i> at 391-407. The court believed that the success of these claims hinged primarily on the level of scrutiny that applies after <i>Lawrence. Id.</i> at 393. The court closely analyzed <i>Lawrence</i> and determined that the Supreme Court employed rational basis review to invalidate the convictions under the Texas law against homosexual sodomy. The court, thus, concluded that <i>Lawrence</i> did not alter <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> the applicability of rational basis review, which had been applied in pre-<i>Lawrence</i> challenges to the Act. <i>Id.</i> at 395-96. The court then determined, in accord with pre-<i>Lawrence</i> authority, that Congress had set forth a rational reason for the statute  to promote unit cohesion and discipline  and therefore the facial due process and equal protection claims failed. <i>Id.</i> at 397-406.</p>\n<p>Finally, the district court rejected the plaintiffs' First Amendment challenge. <i>Id.</i> at 407-08. The court noted that the Act does not make a member's statement that he or she is a homosexual a basis for separation; rather separation is mandated only where there has been homosexual conduct or a demonstration of a propensity or intent to engage in such conduct. <i>Id.</i> at 407. Based on this understanding, the court concluded that the Act merely provides for the \"evidentiary use\" of a member's statement regarding sexual orientation and that such use does not violate the First Amendment. <i>Id.</i> at 408.</p>\n<p>Having concluded that all of the plaintiffs' claims failed as a matter of law, the district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice and entered a final judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 410. The plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. <i>Standard of Review</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of a motion to dismiss de novo, accepting the complaint's well-pleaded facts as true and indulging all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor. <i>SFW Arecibo, Ltd. v.

They contend that the district court incorrectly dismissed their substantive due process and equal protection claims because the court misunderstood <i>Lawrence</i> to mandate a rational basis standard of review, rather than some form of heightened judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p>In addition, the plaintiffs dispute the district court's ruling that they did not present as-applied due process and equal protection challenges. Finally, they posit that they sufficiently pleaded a First Amendment challenge to the portion of the Act that triggers separation proceeding based on a member's statement of sexual identity because such a statement is a form of protected speech that is punished by the Act.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Due Process</h2>\n<p>We agree with the parties and the district court that interpreting <i>Lawrence</i> is the critical first step in evaluating the plaintiffs' substantive due process claim. Prior to <i>Lawrence,</i> the courts of appeals, relying on the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Bowers v. Hardwick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111738\"><a href=\"/opinion/111738/bowers-v-hardwick/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111738\"><a href=\"/opinion/111738/bowers-v-hardwick/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But <i>Lawrence</i> overruled <i>Bowers,</i> so the post-<i>Lawrence</i> standard for reviewing a substantive due process challenge to the Act is unclear. Before addressing the district court's conclusion that the rational basis standard continues to apply, we review basic substantive due process principles.</p>\n<p>It has long been held that, despite their name, the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments \"guarantee[] more than fair process.\" <i>Troxel v.

The laws involved in <i>Bowers</i> and here are, to be sure, statutes that purport to do no more than prohibit a particular sexual act. Their penalties and purposes, though, have more far-reaching consequences, touching upon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home.

When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring. The liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right to make this choice.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 567, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130160\"><a href=\"/opinion/130160/lawrence-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention from government. \"It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.\" The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.

Some have read <i>Lawrence</i> to apply a rational basis approach.<sup>[5]</sup> Others see the case as applying strict scrutiny.<sup>[6]</sup> And a third group view the case as applying a balancing of state and individual interests that cannot be characterized as strict scrutiny or rational basis.<sup>[7]</sup><i>Lawrence</i>'s <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> doctrinal approach is \"difficult to pin down.\" Nan D. Hunter, <i>Living with Lawrence,</i> 88 Minn. L.Rev. 1103 (2004). But we are persuaded that <i>Lawrence</i> did indeed recognize a protected liberty interest for adults to engage in private, consensual sexual intimacy and applied a balancing of constitutional interests that defies either the strict scrutiny or rational basis label.</p>\n<p>There are at least four reasons for reading <i>Lawrence</i> as recognizing a protected liberty interest. First, <i>Lawrence</i> relies on the following due process cases for doctrinal support: <i>Griswold, Eisenstadt, Roe, Carey,</i> and <i>Casey.</i> 539 U.S. at 565-66, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130160\"><a href=\"/opinion/130160/lawrence-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2472</span></a></span>. Each case resulted in the Supreme Court recognizing a due process right to make personal decisions related to sexual conduct that mandated the application of heightened judicial scrutiny. <i>Id.</i> It would be strange indeed to interpret <i>Lawrence</i> as not recognizing a protected liberty interest when virtually every case it relied upon for support recognized such an interest.</p>\n<p>Second, the language employed throughout <i>Lawrence</i> supports the recognition of a protected liberty interest. <i>Lawrence</i> associated the right at issue with the core constitutional rights of \"freedom of thought, belief, and expression,\" rights which undoubtedly mandate special protection under the Constitution. <i>Id.</i> at 563, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130160\"><a href=\"/opinion/130160/lawrence-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2472</span></a></span>. It also stated that \"liberty gives <i>substantial</i> protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex.\" <i>Id.</i> at 572, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130160\"><a href=\"/opinion/130160/lawrence-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2472</span></a></span> (emphasis supplied). And it concluded its analysis by stating that the \"right to liberty under the Due Process Clause\" allowed the petitioners to engage in \"private sexual conduct\" because \"`[i]t is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 578, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130160\"><a href=\"/opinion/130160/lawrence-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2472</span></a></span> (quoting <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S. at 847, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112786\"><a href=\"/opinion/112786/planned-parenthood-of-southeastern-pa-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2791</span></a></span>). Such language strongly suggests that <i>Lawrence</i> identified a protected liberty interest.</p>\n<p>Third, in overruling <i>Bowers, Lawrence</i> relied on Justice Stevens' <i>Bowers</i> dissent as stating the controlling principles. <i>Id.</i> at 578, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130160\"><a href=\"/opinion/130160/lawrence-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2472</span></a></span>. The passage of Justice Stevens' dissent quoted in <i>Lawrence</i> stated that \"individual decisions by married persons, concerning the intimacies of their physical relationship, even when not intended to produce offspring, are a form of liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.... Moreover, this protection extends to intimate choices by unmarried as well as married persons.\" <i>Id.</i> In support of this proposition, Justice Stevens cited <i>Griswold, Eisenstadt</i> and <i>Carey. </i><i>Bowers,</i> 478 U.S. at 216, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111738\"><a href=\"/opinion/111738/bowers-v-hardwick/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2841</span></a></span> (Stevens, J., dissenting). As discussed above, these are due process cases that recognize protected liberty interests. Furthermore, in the very next passage of Justice Stevens' dissent, he described these cases as establishing rights that are \"fundamental\" and placed the right of adults to engage in private intimate conduct in the same category. <i>Id.</i> It is impossible to read <i>Lawrence</i> as declining to recognize a protected liberty interest without ignoring the Court's statement that Justice Stevens' <i>Bowers</i> dissent was controlling.</p>\n<p>Finally, if <i>Lawrence</i> had applied traditional rational basis review (the appropriate standard if no protected liberty interest was at stake, <i>see e.g., </i><i>Medeiros,</i> 431 F.3d at 33), the convictions under the Texas statute would have been sustained. The governmental interest in prohibiting immoral conduct was the only state interest that Texas offered to justify the statute. <i>Lawrence,</i> 539 U.S. at 582, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130160\"><a href=\"/opinion/130160/lawrence-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2472</span></a></span>. It is well established that a \"legislature [can] legitimately act ... to protect the societal interest in order and morality.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> <i>Barnes v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span> (1973)). Thus, <i>Lawrence's</i> holding can only be squared with the Supreme Court's acknowledgment of morality as a rational basis by concluding that a protected liberty interest was at stake, and therefore a rational basis for the law was not sufficient.</p>\n<p>Taking into account the precedent relied on by <i>Lawrence,</i> the tenor of its language, its special reliance on Justice Stevens' <i>Bowers</i> dissent, and its rejection of morality as an adequate basis for the law in question, we are convinced that <i>Lawrence</i> recognized that adults maintain a protected liberty interest to engage in certain \"consensual sexual intimacy in the home.\" The district court, relying on cases from other circuits, read <i>Lawrence</i> as applying rational basis review. We, however, do not find any of the four primary reasons supporting this view persuasive. <i>See </i><i>Muth v. Frank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790739\"><a href=\"/opinion/790739/allen-a-muth-v-matthew-j-frank-secretary/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span>, 817-18 (7th Cir.2005); <i>Lofton v.

While it is true that <i>Lawrence</i> nowhere used the word \"fundamental\" to describe the interest at stake, there are several Supreme Court cases that have recognized protected liberty interests without using this word. For example, in <i>Washington v. Harper,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112381\"><a href=\"/opinion/112381/washington-v-harper/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 223, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112381\"><a href=\"/opinion/112381/washington-v-harper/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span> (1990) (describing the interest as a \"constitutionally protected liberty interest\"); <i>Youngberg v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span> (1982) (describing the interests as \"liberty interests\"). It is thus clear that the Supreme Court does not always use the word \"fundamental\" when it wishes to identify an interest protected by substantive due process.</p>\n<p>Second, it has been maintained that <i>Lawrence</i> could not have identified a protected liberty interest because the Supreme Court did not engage in a thorough analysis of the \"Nation's history and tradition\" as required under <i>Glucksberg. </i><i>Muth,</i> 412 F.3d at 817; <i>Williams,</i> 378 F.3d at 1236; <i>Lofton,</i> 358 F.3d at 816-17. This argument is based on the mistaken premise that the only history relevant to the substantive due process inquiry is a history demonstrating affirmative government action to protect the right in question. But <i>Glucksberg</i> does not establish such a requirement. <i>Lawrence</i> engaged in a thorough historical analysis identifying the lack of a long history of government action to punish the private consensual, intimate conduct of homosexuals. This sort of historical analysis is not inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent in this area. Indeed, if affirmative government action protecting a right were required to trigger substantive due process protection, at least some of the due process cases recognizing a liberty interest would have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> come out differently because there was no established history of government protection for the right to have an abortion or to use contraception. <i>See </i><i>Roe,</i> 410 U.S. at 132-41, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108713\"><a href=\"/opinion/108713/roe-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span> (reviewing history of abortion law to show that laws restricting abortion are of recent vintage but not showing any history of affirmative government action to protect the right to an abortion); <i>see also </i><i>Williams,</i> 378 F.3d at 1258-59.</p>\n<p>Moreover, to the extent that <i>Lawrence</i> did not adhere to the <i>Glucksberg</i> approach of locating the right to private, consensual adult intimacy in the Nation's history and tradition, it explicitly disavowed the exclusivity of this approach. <i>See </i><i>Lawrence,</i> 539 U.S. at 572, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130160\"><a href=\"/opinion/130160/lawrence-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2472</span></a></span> (\"history and tradition are the starting but not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due process inquiry.\"). In this regard, the <i>Lawrence</i> Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>[W]e think that our laws and traditions in the past half century are of most relevance here. These references show an emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 571-72, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130160\"><a href=\"/opinion/130160/lawrence-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2472</span></a></span>. Thus, <i>Lawrence</i> recognized that, in at least some circumstances, the consideration of recent trends and practices is relevant to defining the scope of protected liberty.</p>\n<p>Third, it has been suggested that the <i>Lawrence</i> majority's refusal to respond to Justice Scalia's <i>Lawrence</i> dissent, in which he argued that the majority had not recognized a protected liberty interest, indicates that the majority agreed with the dissent's analysis. <i>See </i><i>Sylvester v. Fogley,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">851</span></span>, 858 (8th Cir.2006). The district court relied heavily on this point, observing that \"it might be expected that if [Justice Scalia's dissent] wrongly characterized a principal holding of the case, the majority would have answered and corrected it.\" <i>Cook,</i> 429 F.Supp.2d at 394.</p>\n<p>This is a possible explanation for the majority's silence, but it is not the only explanation. It is equally possible that the <i>Lawrence</i> majority believed that the text of its opinion stood for itself and that there was little to be gained by debating Justice Scalia on this point. <i>Cf. </i><i>Cent. Bank of Denver N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver N.A.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117837\"><a href=\"/opinion/117837/central-bank-of-denver-na-v-first-interstate-bank-of-denver-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>, 187, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117837\"><a href=\"/opinion/117837/central-bank-of-denver-na-v-first-interstate-bank-of-denver-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span> (1994) (\"Congressional inaction lacks persuasive significance because several equally tenable inferences may be drawn from such inaction....\"). Given the equally possible, but conflicting, inferences that can be drawn from the majority's lack of response to Justice Scalia's dissent, we think that there is little to be gleaned about <i>Lawrence</i>'s meaning from it.</p>\n<p>Finally, it has been claimed that <i>Lawrence</i>'s conclusion that \"[t]he Texas statute furthers <i>no legitimate state interest</i> which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual\" indicates that <i>Lawrence</i> did not recognize a protected liberty interest. <i>Sylvester,</i> 465 F.3d at 857; <i>Muth,</i> 412 F.3d at 818; <i>Lofton,</i> 358 F.3d at 817 (emphasis supplied). This argument is premised on the notion that the words \"legitimate state interest\" indicate the application of rational basis review, which is not the proper standard where a protected liberty interest is implicated. As the district court stated, \"[t]he use of the appropriate adjective is telltale to constitutional lawyers. If the <i>Lawrence</i> court had been evaluating the constitutionality of the Texas statute under the more exacting standard where fundamental interests are at stake, it would instead have asked whether the state interest was compelling, rather than whether it was legitimate.\" <i>Cook,</i> 429 F.Supp.2d at 395.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> We take a different view. A law survives rational basis review so long as the law is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. <i>E.g., </i><i>Nordlinger v. Hahn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112763\"><a href=\"/opinion/112763/nordlinger-v-hahn/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 11-12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112763\"><a href=\"/opinion/112763/nordlinger-v-hahn/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1992). Rational basis review does <i>not</i> permit consideration of the strength of the individual's interest or the extent of the intrusion on that interest caused by the law; the focus is entirely on the rationality of the state's reason for enacting the law. <i>See </i><i>Heller v.

The President instructed the Secretary to consult with the military's professional leadership and others concerned with the issue. <i>Id.</i> While this review was in progress, an interim policy was imposed that ended the practice of asking new recruits to confirm that they were heterosexual.</p>\n<p>Congress quickly intervened. A few weeks after President Clinton was sworn in, Congress passed a provision calling for a review of the military's approach to homosexuals serving in the military by the Secretary of Defense and the Senate Armed Services Committee. <i>See</i> Pub.L. 103-3 § 601, 107 Stat. 6, 28-29 (1993).</p>\n<p>Subsequently, the Department and congressional committees engaged in an exhaustive policy review.

The Committees heard from witnesses with a wide range of views and various backgrounds, including the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, military and legal experts, enlisted personnel, officers, and public policy activists. <i>See Assessment of the Plan to Lift the Ban on Homosexuals in the Military: Hearings Before the Military Forces and Personnel Subcomm. of the House Comm. on Armed Services,</i> 103 Cong., 1st Sess.

The Senate Report also focused explicitly on the effect that the Act could have on constitutional rights of homosexuals, concluding that \"if the Supreme Court should reverse its ruling in <i>Bowers</i> and hold that private consensual homosexual acts between adults may not be prosecuted in civilian society, this would not alter the committee's judgment as to the effect of homosexual conduct in the armed forces.\" S. Rep. 103-112 at 287.</p>\n<p>Prior to the enactment of the Act, the full House and Senate debated the measure and considered floor amendments. In particular, each house rejected amendments that would have permitted the military to develop whatever policy it deemed appropriate and would have allowed the Department to resume asking applicants to state their sexual orientation. 139 Cong. Rec. S11168-11228 (Sept. 9, 1993); 139 Cong. Rec. H7084-86 (Sept. 29, 1993). The Act became law in November 1993, and, as stated earlier, the Act expressly identified its purpose as preserving \"high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion\" in the military. 10 U.S.C. § 654(a)(15).</p>\n<p>The circumstances surrounding the Act's passage lead to the firm conclusion that Congress and the Executive studied the issues intensely and from many angles, including by considering the constitutional rights of gay and lesbian service members. S. Rep. 103-112 at 286-87. Congress ultimately concluded that the voluminous evidentiary record supported adopting a policy of separating certain homosexuals from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> military service to preserve the \"high morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion\" of the troops.</p>\n<p>Acknowledging the government interest identified in this case, one that our deferential posture requires us to take at face value, as-applied challenges to the Act must fail as well.</p>\n<p>Here, as in <i>Rostker,</i> there is a detailed legislative record concerning Congress' reasons for passing the Act. This record makes plain that Congress concluded, after considered deliberation, that the Act was necessary to preserve the military's effectiveness as a fighting force, 10 U.S.C. § 654(a)(15), and thus, to ensure national security. This is an exceedingly weighty interest and one that unquestionably surpasses the government interest that was at stake in <i>Lawrence.

Every member of the armed forces has one fact in common  at a moment's notice he or she may be deployed to a combat area. 10 U.S.C. § 654(a)(11). The conditions of service in such an area bring into play the animating concerns behind the Act, namely, maintaining the morale and unit cohesion that the military deems essential to an effective fighting force. <i>See</i> 10 U.S.C § 654(a)(12), (15). Accordingly, we have no choice but to dismiss the plaintiffs' as-applied challenge.</p>\n<p>To be sure, deference to Congressional judgment in this area does not mean abdication. <i>Rostker,</i> 453 U.S. at 67, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110548\"><a href=\"/opinion/110548/rostker-v-goldberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, there is no basis for arguing that <i>Lawrence</i> changed the standard of review applicable to a legislative classification based on sexual orientation.</p>\n<p>As neither <i>Romer</i> nor <i>Lawrence</i> mandate heightened scrutiny of the Act because of its classification of homosexuals, the district court was correct to analyze the plaintiffs' equal protection claim under the rational basis standard.

First Amendment</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs' final challenge attacks the portion of the Act that subjects a member to possible separation for making a statement identifying himself or herself as a homosexual. The plaintiffs assert that they have adequately stated a claim that this aspect of the Act violates the First Amendment because it subjects a member to separation for stating his or her sexual identity.<sup>[13]</sup> The plaintiffs maintain that this aspect of the Act is invalid because it restricts the content of the plaintiffs' speech and forces them to pretend that they are heterosexual.</p>\n<p>There is no question that members of the military are engaging in speech when they state their sexual orientation. <i>See </i><i>Hurley v.

But \"our review of military regulations challenged on First Amendment grounds is far more deferential than constitutional review of similar laws or regulations designed for civilian society.\" <i>Id.</i> This limitation is rooted in the recognition that free expression can sometimes conflict with the military's compelling need to \"foster instinctive obedience, unity, commitment, and espirit de corps\" and that \"the essence of military service is the subordination of the desires and interests of the individual to the needs of service.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The Act does affect the right of military members to express their sexual orientation by establishing the possibility of adverse consequences from announcing their sexual orientation. But the Act's purpose is not to restrict this kind of speech. Its purpose is to identify those who have engaged or are likely to engage in a homosexual act as defined by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> statute. The law is thus aimed at eliminating certain conduct or the possibility of certain conduct from occurring in the military environment, not at restricting speech. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Philips v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span> (1985). As the Fourth Circuit explained in rejecting a challenge identical to the one presented here:</p>\n<blockquote>There is no constitutional impediment,. . . to the use of speech as relevant evidence of facts that may furnish a permissible basis for separation from military service. No First Amendment concern would arise, for instance, from the discharge of service members for declaring that they would refuse to follow orders, or that they were addicted to controlled substances. Such remarks provide evidence of activity that the military may validly proscribe.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Thomasson,</i> 80 F.3d at 931.</p>\n<p>We think that the Fourth Circuit has correctly analyzed this claim. To the extent that the Act may be constitutionally applied to circumscribe sexual conduct, the First Amendment does not bar the military from using a member's declaration of homosexuality as evidence of a violation of the Act. We therefore join the other courts that have rejected First Amendment challenges to the Act on this basis. <i>See </i><i>Holmes,</i> 124 F.3d at 1136; <i>Able,</i> 88 F.3d at 1300; <i>Thomasson,</i> 80 F.3d at 931.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs argue that, after <i>Lawrence,</i> this analysis is \"outmoded.\" We disagree. The Act does not punish a member for making a statement regarding sexual orientation; separation from service is mandated only because a member has engaged, intends to engage or has a propensity to engage in a homosexual act. This is still a question concerning conduct (or likely conduct); the member's speech continues to have only evidentiary significance in making this conduct-focused determination.</p>\n<p>Citing <i>Dawson v. Delaware,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112702\"><a href=\"/opinion/112702/dawson-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112702\"><a href=\"/opinion/112702/dawson-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span> (1992), the plaintiffs also argue that the First Amendment nevertheless limits the kinds of statements that may be used by the government as evidence in an adversary proceeding. In <i>Dawson,</i> the Supreme Court held that the defendant's membership in a white supremacist group could not be introduced against him in a capital sentencing hearing because it violated the defendant's First Amendment right to associate. <i>Id.</i> at 166-68, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112702\"><a href=\"/opinion/112702/dawson-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1093</span></a></span>. In reaching this conclusion, the Court emphasized that the admission violated the First Amendment because it had \"no bearing on the issue being tried.\" <i>Id.</i> No similar claim can be made here. A statement by a member that he or she is homosexual is undoubtedly relevant to the kind of conduct a member intends to engage in or has a propensity to engage in. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Simkanin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791592\"><a href=\"/opinion/791592/united-states-v-richard-michael-simkanin/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span>, 417-18 (5th Cir.2005) (concluding that <i>Dawson</i> did not apply where the defendant's statement was relevant to the issues at sentencing). Therefore, <i>Dawson</i> is inapposite.</p>\n<p>Finally, plaintiffs argue that the Act's rebuttable presumption violates their First Amendment rights. The Act's rebuttable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> presumption works as follows. A military member may be separated from the armed forces if,</p>\n<blockquote>the member has stated that he or she is a homosexual or bisexual, or words to that effect, <i>unless</i> there is a further finding, made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in the regulations, that the member has demonstrated that he or she is not a person who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.</blockquote>\n<p>10 U.S.C. § 654(b)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' attack on the rebuttable presumption is twofold. First, they claim that for homosexual military members, the rebuttable presumption is functionally impossible to rebut. Because they are homosexual within the meaning of section 654(f)(1), they cannot prove that they are not homosexual as section 654(b)(2) effectively requires. Second, the plaintiffs argue that even if section 654(b)(2) <i>did</i> offer a presumption capable of being rebutted by homosexual members, the existence of such a presumption \"would still force [them] and other gay and lesbian service members to live in an environment that severely restricts and chills constitutionally protected speech.\" We deal with each contention in turn.</p>\n<p>Each plaintiff has agreed that he or she is a person who \"engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.\" 10 U.S.C. § 654(f)(1). Because they admit they fall within section 654(f)(1)'s definition of homosexual, none of them could have proved at a separation proceeding that she or he was not a person who \"engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in\" prohibited conduct because, by definition, they are such a person. <i>See id.</i> In that sense, for a military member who is homosexual as defined by 654(f)(1), the rebuttable presumption would be functionally impossible to rebut.</p>\n<p>But that does not mean the Act violates the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights. As noted earlier, the government may use a member's statement that he or she is a homosexual as evidence that he or she \"engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.\" If a person cannot show otherwise, because in fact he or she does engage in or have such a propensity to engage in homosexual conduct, then the military is entitled to separate that person from the service. The military, in that scenario, is not punishing speech but conduct or propensity to engage in conduct.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the contention that it is functionally impossible for a gay member to say \"I am homosexual\" and then rebut the presumption according to the terms of section 654(b)(2) is inaccurate on its face. A member's personal definition of \"homosexuality\" may not be coextensive with the Act's. For example, a person may say he or she is homosexual even though the person does not engage in, attempt to engage in, have a propensity to engage in, or intend to engage in homosexual acts. In that scenario, there is a meaningful opportunity to rebut the presumption. The Ninth Circuit's opinion in <i>Holmes</i> provides examples.</p>\n<blockquote>One female Naval officer admitted to her homosexuality but submitted a statement, in which she stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that she understands the rules against homosexual conduct and intended to obey those rules. Another female Naval officer stated that she was a lesbian but that the statement `in no way, was meant to imply [ ] any propensity or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> intent or desire to engage in prohibited conduct.'</blockquote>\n<p>124 F.3d at 1136.</p>\n<p>Of course, a situation may arise where a gay member triggers the rebuttable presumption by stating he is gay, proves he is not a person who \"engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts,\" and yet is still separated from service. This member would have an administrative challenge available to him. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. § 701. No facts have been plead suggesting such a scenario arose in this case.</p>\n<p>We now turn to the plaintiffs' alternative argument that the rebuttable presumption, even if capable of being rebutted by homosexual military members, chills their First Amendment rights. The plaintiffs suggest that the presumption is content based and thus unconstitutional. The Fourth Circuit rejected a similar argument in <i>Thomasson.</i> It observed:</p>\n<blockquote>Whenever a provision prohibits certain acts, it necessarily chills speech that constitutes evidence of the acts. A regulation directed at acts thus inevitably restricts a certain type of speech; this policy is no exception. But effects of this variety do not establish a content-based restriction of speech.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Thomasson,</i> 80 F.3d at 932.</p>\n<p>As we explained, the Act's purpose is not to restrict military members from expressing their sexual orientation. Its purpose is to identify those who have engaged in or are likely to engage in a homosexual act. The fact that the Act may, in operation, have the effect of chilling speech does not change the analysis. <i>See </i><i>Ward v.

Although the wisdom behind the statute at issue here may be questioned by some, in light of the special deference we grant Congressional decision-making in this area we conclude that the challenges must be dismissed.</p>\n<p>We <i>affirm</i> the judgment of the district court. No costs are awarded.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p>SARIS, United States District Judge, concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p>I concur with the majority opinion regarding the application of <i>Lawrence</i> to the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" statute, 10 U.S.C. § 654 (the \"Act\"). I also concur with the majority's discussion of the plaintiffs' equal protection challenge. However, I respectfully dissent from the discussion of the plaintiffs' claim that 10 U.S.C. § 654(b)(2)<sup>[14]</sup> violates the First Amendment.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> The military calls the evidentiary presumption created by 10 U.S.C. § 654(b)(2) a \"rebuttable\" presumption. <i>See</i> Department of Defense (\"DoD\") Directive No. 1332.14 ¶ E3.A1.1.8.1.2.2 (amended 1994) (\"A statement by a Service member that he or she is a homosexual or bisexual, or words to that effect, creates a <i>rebuttable presumption</i> that the Service member engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.\") (emphasis added). Because the plaintiffs dispute that the presumption is rebuttable, I adopt the phrasing used by the Second Circuit, and call the presumption the \"statement presumption.\" <i>See </i><i>Able v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721460\"><a href=\"/opinion/721460/lieutenant-colonel-jane-able-petty-officer-robert-heigle-first-lieutenant/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1280</span></a></span>, 1283 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>The Claims</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that the statement presumption violates the First Amendment in two ways. <i>First,</i> they contend that the presumption is a dead letter in practice because, as applied, \"it is functionally impossible for a gay service member to say `I am gay' and then prove that he has no `propensity' to engage in homosexual activity, even if the service member could show a track record of celibacy and an honest intent to refrain from prohibited conduct.\" In the plaintiffs' view, the only way to avoid discharge is to recant their sexual orientation. As such, the statement presumption is allegedly used to punish plaintiffs' speech concerning their own status as homosexuals.</p>\n<p>Second, the plaintiffs argue that the statement presumption is an unconstitutional allocation of the burden of proof, which chills their own speech as well as a whole range of protected expression by both gay and straight service members. The plaintiffs argue that:</p>\n<blockquote>The provision's burden falls on any speaker whose \"[l]anguage or behavior\" suggests to \"a reasonable person\" that the person \"intended to convey\" that he or she is gay. This broad definition could chill a whole range of protected expression: A service member might wave a rainbow flag or wear a pink triangle, or he might state that he opposes \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\" Under § 654's burden-shifting mechanism, these possibilities and more could force the service memberwhether straight or gayinto discharge proceedings where he must prove that he has no propensity to engage in homosexual conduct.</blockquote>\n<p>(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Content Neutrality</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The starting point for the analysis is the difficult question of whether the statement presumption restricts speech based on its content or viewpoint. I ultimately agree with the majority's position that the statement presumption is content-neutral, but I believe that the issue is a much closer call.</p>\n<p>\"The First Amendment generally prevents government from proscribing speech, or even expressive conduct, because of disapproval of the ideas expressed.

It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote>Contrary to the district court, we do not believe that, in the context of a facial challenge, we may conclude that the Act equates status with propensity. To be sure, in most cases a member who admits to a homosexual orientation will eventually be separated from the armed forces. But that is because the evidentiary value of the admission is strongly linked to what it is used to prove: a likelihood of engaging in homosexual acts. The plaintiffs cannot prove and the district court cannot credibly maintain that there are no instances in which a person will be retained, despite admitting to a homosexual status, because there is no likelihood that he will engage in such acts. The Directives promulgated by the DoD in accordance with the Act specifically contemplate that such an event may occur. <i>See</i> DoD Directive No. 1332.14, encl. 3, pt. 1, at H.1.b(2).</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 1298.</p>\n<p>As the Supreme Court has held, when it is not clear whether a restriction is content-based or content-neutral, the controlling consideration is the governmental purpose in enacting the legislation. <i>Renton,</i> 475 U.S. at 48, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111597\"><a href=\"/opinion/111597/renton-v-playtime-theatres-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></a></span> (1989). Here, the government insists that the purpose of the Act is to target conduct, not status, and points to DoD Directives that limit the Act to only those who engage in or are likely to engage in homosexual conduct. <i>See</i> DoD Directive No. 1332.14 ¶ E2.1.10 (defining \"propensity to engage in homosexual acts\" to mean \"more than an abstract preference or desire to engage <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> in homosexual acts; it indicates a <i>likelihood</i> that a person engages in or will engage in homosexual acts\") (emphasis added); <i>see also id.</i> at ¶ E3.A1.1.8.1.2.2 (same). In response, the plaintiffs point to the plain terms of the statute, and also to a regulation that states that the statement presumption encompasses \"[l]anguage or behavior that a reasonable person would believe was intended to convey the statement that a person engages in, attempts to engage in, or has a propensity to engage in homosexual acts.\" <i>Id.</i> at ¶ E2.1.16. According to plaintiffs, given the vagueness of the term \"propensity,\" the statement presumption can be interpreted to reach expressions of mere homosexual status.</p>\n<p>While the question is close, I conclude that the statement presumption is better viewed as content-neutral because its primary purpose, as set forth by the government, is to target conduct, not speech. <i>But see </i><i>Thomasson,</i> 80 F.3d at 934 (Luttig, J., concurring) (agreeing with plaintiff that the purpose of Congress in passing the Act was to mandate exclusion of all known homosexuals based on their orientation or status \"regardless of whether they have actually engaged in homosexual conduct or are likely to engage in any such conduct\").</p>\n<p>Thus, under the standard that applies to content-neutral restrictions on speech, the critical remaining inquiries are \"(1) whether the statement[] presumption furthers a substantial governmental interest, and (2) whether the statement[] presumption restricts the plaintiffs' speech <i>no more than is essential.</i>\" <i>Able,</i> 88 F.3d at 1295 (emphasis added). For the reasons stated by the majority opinion with respect to the plaintiffs' other constitutional claims, the answer to the first of these inquiries is \"yes.\" Accordingly, I now turn to the question of whether the statement presumption, as applied, is overly restrictive of the plaintiffs' speech.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Dead Letter</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Undaunted by pre-<i>Lawrence</i> case law, the plaintiffs, who all admit they are homosexual within the meaning of Section 654(f)(1),<sup>[16]</sup> argue that the statement presumption burdens speech more than is essential because, as applied, it is \"functionally impossible\" to rebut the presumption short of recanting one's status. As such, plaintiffs allege that the statement presumption punishes service members who speak about their constitutionally protected homosexual status by requiring their discharge.</p>\n<p>The government disagrees with plaintiffs' dead letter theory that the statement presumption is impossible to rebut in practice. The government points out that, although the Act broadly defines homosexual conduct to include a \"propensity to engage in\" homosexual conduct, 10 U.S.C. § 654(f)(1), the implementing DoD Directives narrowly interpret \"propensity to engage in\" homosexual conduct to mean \"more than an abstract preference or desire to engage in homosexual acts; it indicates a <i>likelihood</i> that a person engages in or will engage in homosexual acts.\" DoD Directive No. 1332.14 ¶ E2.1.10 (defining \"propensity\") (emphasis added); <i>see also</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> <i>id.</i> at ¶ E3.A1.1.8.1.2.2 (same). Accordingly, in the government's view, because a service member's personal definition of \"homosexuality\" may not coincide with the Act's definition, a service member may be able to successfully rebut the statement presumption if he can show that his statement \"I am gay\" is not indicative of a likelihood that the he will engage in proscribed homosexual conduct.</p>\n<p>As several courts have pointed out, the line between \"propensity\" and \"orientation\" is razor-thin at best. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Able,</i> 880 F.Supp. at 975 (characterizing the distinction between \"orientation\" and \"propensity\" as \"Orwellian\"); <i>Thomasson,</i> 80 F.3d at 941-42 n. 8 (Luttig, J., concurring) (\"I do not know what homosexual orientation is, if it is not the propensity to commit homosexual acts; indeed, I do not understand how one even knows that he has a homosexual orientation except by realizing that he has a propensity toward the commission of homosexual acts.\"). Emphasizing that \"propensity\" sweeps in everyone who is gay, plaintiffs allege that, in practice, gay and lesbian service members are routinely discharged despite evidence that there is no likelihood that they will engage in proscribed homosexual conduct while they are in military service. Accordingly, plaintiffs contend that any honest admission of a gay or lesbian service member's sexual orientation results in discharge.</p>\n<p>In my view, if the Act were applied to punish statements about one's status as a homosexual, it would constitute a content-based speech restriction subject to strict scrutiny. <i>See </i><i>Meinhold v.

This designation by the majority is understandable because plaintiffs are unclear as to whether this is a facial challenge, an as-applied challenge, or both.</p>\n<p>Because the plaintiffs have not expressly raised a facial challenge to the statement presumption, I will treat the claim as an as-applied challenge. The majority is correct to state that \"[n]one of the plaintiffs contend that they were separated from service because they participated in expressive activities.\" Op. at 62 n. 13. However, the core of the plaintiffs' as-applied challenge is that they were <i>chilled</i> from engaging in protected speech, not that they were punished for engaging in such speech.</p>\n<p>As a preliminary matter, the government has argued that this allocation-of-proof challenge to the statement presumption was not raised before the district court, and is therefore waived. While the plaintiffs raised a chilling argument before the district court, they did not raise this precise argument.

Even then, the deference is not absolute. In <i>Brown v. Glines</i><i>,</i> for example, the Court held that the limitations on on-base petitions \"restrict speech no more than is reasonably necessary\" because it allowed for alternative channels of protest, such as through the United States mail, and the regulations \"specifically prevent commanders from halting the distribution of materials that merely criticize the Government or its policies.\" 444 U.S. at 355, 100 S.Ct. 609.</p>\n<p>The most troubling aspect of the Act's statement presumption is that it covers purely private speech, and public speech made off base and off duty. By its own terms, the Act is \"pervasive\" in scope, applies \"24 hours [a] day,\" and applies even to speech made \"off base\" and/or \"off duty.\" <i>See</i> 10 U.S.C. §§ 654(a)(9)-(11). Thus, as alleged in the complaint, the Act required the discharge of some of the plaintiffs based upon strictly private speech, such as confiding in a friend or words within a letter from a friend or family member. In addition, the amicus brief submitted by the constitutional law professors cites the example of an Arizona state representative who spoke about his homosexuality on the floor of the legislature. After the military discovered the speech through an anonymous complaint and initiated discharge proceedings against the representative, he negotiated a voluntary separation from the Army. <i>See generally</i> Tobias Barrington Wolff, <i>Political Representation and Accountability Under Don't Ask, Don't Tell,</i> 89 Iowa L.Rev. 1633, 1644-50 (2004) (providing examples of the Act's statement presumption being applied to conversations with family members, sessions with chaplains and psychotherapists, and certain public statements).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that the statement presumption, as applied, chills speech because a service member will fear triggering a discharge proceeding, regardless of whether he or she could successfully rebut the presumption. As the Supreme Court explained when striking down a statement presumption in another context, \"[t]he man who knows that he must bring forth proof and persuade another of the lawfulness of his conduct necessarily must steer far wider of the unlawful zone than if the State must bear these burdens.\" <i>Speiser v.

It concluded that, although the plaintiffs tried to plead as-applied challenges, the complaint failed to identify facts showing that the Act was \"misapplied\" in certain cases. We view differently the necessary factual predicate for an as-applied constitutional challenge to the Act. A claim that the Act was \"misapplied\" in a particular case is actionable, if at all, under the Administrative Procedures Act. <i>See </i><i>Richenberg v. Perry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"727261\"><a href=\"/opinion/727261/richard-f-richenberg-jr-v-william-j-perry-secretary-of-defense-sheila/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span>, 263 (8th Cir.1996) (assuming that a review of separation decision under the Act is reviewable under the APA). But this is not the plaintiffs' claim. The plaintiffs allege that, even though the Act was properly administered according to its terms to separate each of them from service, the Act cannot be constitutionally applied in their particular cases because the application unconstitutionally infringes on their <i>Lawrence</i> interest. As-applied challenges \"`are the basic building blocks of constitutional adjudication'\" because they relieve the court of having \"to consider every conceivable situation which might possibly arise in the application of complex and comprehensive legislation.\" <i>Carhart,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 1639. A plaintiff asserts an as-applied challenge by claiming that a statute is unconstitutional as-applied to his or her particular conduct, even though the statute may be valid as to other parties. <i>See </i><i>Daggett v. Comm'n of Gov. Ethics &amp; Election Practices,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767873\"><a href=\"/opinion/767873/beverly-c-daggett-elaine-fuller-christopher-m-harte-mark-t-cenci/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span>, 472 (1st Cir.2000). The plaintiffs have pleaded classic as-applied challenges here because they claim that the Act is unconstitutional as applied to them, even though the Act may be constitutional as applied to others.</p>\n<p>[9]  Other examples of the deferential approach the Court has taken when analyzing constitutional challenges in the military context include: <i>Goldman v.

The 9th Circuit relied on the Supreme Court's pre-<i>Lawrence</i> decision in <i>Sell</i> as a touchstone for its due process inquiry. <i>Id.</i> at ___-___, 2008 U.S.App. LEXIS 10794, *29-30. Although we find <i>Sell</i> instructive in the sense that it illustrates the Supreme Court's application of an intermediate level of scrutiny, we do not find <i>Sell</i> especially helpful in analyzing this statute regulating military affairs.</p>\n<p>[11]  The Fifth Amendment does not contain an equal protection clause but the due process clause has been interpreted to include an equal protection component. <i>See </i><i>Bolling v. Sharpe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105222\"><a href=\"/opinion/105222/bolling-v-sharpe/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span>, 499, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105222\"><a href=\"/opinion/105222/bolling-v-sharpe/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></a></span> (1954).</p>\n<p>[12]  The plaintiffs acknowledge that a conclusion that the Act survives rational basis review defeats their facial and as-applied equal protection challenges.</p>\n<p>[13]  For the first time on appeal, the plaintiffs contend that a wide variety of expressive activities could trigger discharge proceedings. They argue, \"A service member might wave a rainbow flag or wear a pink triangle, or he might state that he opposes `Don't Ask, Don't Tell.' Under § 654 . . . these possibilities and more could force the service member whether straight or gayinto discharge proceedings where he must prove that he has no propensity to engage in homosexual conduct.\" None of the plaintiffs contend that they were separated from service because they participated in expressive activities. Moreover, the explicit terms of the Act do not indicate that such activities could trigger separation proceedings and the government has stipulated they do not. DOD Directive 1332.414 § E3.A4; DOD Instruction 1332.40 § E8. In any event, we decline to reach this newly raised overbreadth argument on appeal. <i>See </i><i>Brown v. Hot, Sexy &amp; Safer Productions, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"706820\"><a href=\"/opinion/706820/ronald-c-brown-v-hot-sexy-and-safer-productions-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span>, 530 (1st Cir.1995) (stating that an appeal from a motion to dismiss \"is not an opportunity to conjure new arguments not raised before the district court.\").</p>\n<p>[14]  10 U.S.C. § 654(b)(2) provides, in relevant part, that:\n</p>\n<p>(b) A member of the armed forces shall be separated from the armed forces . . . if one or more of the following findings is made and approved . . .:</p>\n<p>(2) That the member has stated that he or she is a homosexual or bisexual, or words to that effect, unless there is a further finding, made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in the regulations, that the member has demonstrated that he or she is not a person who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.</p>\n<p>[15]  A recent post-<i>Lawrence</i> challenge to the statute did not include a First Amendment claim. <i>See </i><i>Witt v. Dep't of the Air Force,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1457496\"><a href=\"/opinion/1457496/witt-v-department-of-air-force/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span> (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>[16]  As the majority correctly points out, \"[e]ach plaintiff has agreed that he or she is a person who `engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts,'\" as defined under the Act. Yet this concession by the plaintiffs does not end the matter because the plaintiffs also argue that the Act's definition of propensity improperly includes homosexual status. Thus, I do not understand the plaintiffs to be conceding that they could not have rebutted the statement presumption under § 654(b)(2) if, as the government maintains in defending the Act, \"propensity\" was limited to a likelihood of engaging in prohibited homosexual acts while a service member.</p>\n<p>[17]  A group of constitutional law professors submitted an amicus brief in support of this argument.
