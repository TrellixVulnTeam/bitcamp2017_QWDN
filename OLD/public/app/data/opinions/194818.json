Goya, a  creditor, charged\n\nthat  Unanue was continuing to  lead a life  of luxury, traveling\n\nbetween  seven \"fabulously  furnished\"  apartments  which he  had\n\nfraudulently transferred to Liliane, his wife, prior to bankrupt-\n\ncy.   After extensive discovery, Goya moved for leave to commence\n\nan adversary proceeding, in the name  and behalf of the chapter 7\n\nestate,  see  11 U.S.C.   503(b)(3)(B),  against  Liliane and  E-\n            \n\nmperor,  a shell  corporation apparently  controlled  by Liliane.\n\nAlthough  Liliane and Emperor were served with the Goya motion in\n\nJuly 1991, neither responded.\n\n          On August  24, 1991, Goya learned that Emperor had sold\n\none of Unanue's former  condominium apartments some months earli-\n\ner, in May  1991, netting approximately $400,000.   Goya promptly\n\n                                3\n\nrenewed its motion for leave to commence adversary proceedings on\n\nbehalf of the chapter  7 estate, and sought an immediate ex parte\n                                                                 \n\norder of attachment on the apartment-sale proceeds, alleging that\n\nthe  proceeds were assets of the chapter  7 estate and at risk of\n\nremoval from the jurisdiction.   On September 4, 1991, the  bank-\n\nruptcy court authorized Goya to commence an adversary proceeding,\n\nand  issued an  ex parte order  of attachment under  P.R. Rule 56\n                        \n\n(\"September 4  order\").1   On September 9,  Goya provided  appel-\n\nlants  with copies  of  the summons,  complaint,  and motion  for\n\nprovisional remedies.\n\n          In the course  of executing the writ  of attachment, it\n\nwas discovered  that Liliane had  transferred most of  the apart-\n\nment-sale proceeds  to a  Swiss bank  account.  On  September 12,\n\n1991, alarmed by the  apparent removal of the sale  proceeds from\n\nthe  jurisdiction, Goya  sought  additional provisional  remedies\n\nunder Rule 56, including  \"cautionary notices\" and a \"prohibition\n\nagainst alienation\" of  Liliane's remaining properties in  Puerto\n\nRico,  Paris, New  York and Spain.   After notice  to Liliane and\n\nEmperor, and a hearing  on appellants' constitutional claims, the\n\nbankruptcy  court authorized the  additional provisional remedies\n\non September 26 (\"September 26 orders\").\n\n                    \n\n     1Federal Rule  of Civil Procedure 64 is applicable in adver-\nsary proceedings.  See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7064.  Thus, provisional\n                      \nremedies are available in an adversary proceeding, see id. 7001 &amp;\n                                                          \n7064,  \"under the circumstances and in the manner provided by the\nlaw of  the state in which  the district court is  held,\" Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 64.\n\n                                4\n\n          The September 4 and  September 26 orders were  appealed\n\nto the district court on the ground that the provisional remedies\n\nimposed  by  the  bankruptcy  court were  unconstitutional  under\n\nConnecticut v. Doehr, 111  S. Ct. 2105 (1991).   The Commonwealth\n                    \n\nof Puerto  Rico intervened.  See  28 U.S.C.   2403(b).   The dis-\n                                \n\ntrict court upheld the challenged provisional remedies, see In re\n                                                                 \n\nUnanue  Casal, 144 B.R. 604 (D.P.R. 1992), and the present appeal\n             \n\nfollowed.\n\n                                II\n\n                      THE SEPTEMBER 4 ORDER\n                                           \n\n          Although the parties have not done  so, we inquire into\n\nour  jurisdiction to entertain the interlocutory appeal of the ex\n                                                                 \n\nparte order entered on September 4.  See In re Spillane, 884 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n642, 644 (1st  Cir. 1989); In  re Recticel Foam  Corp., 859  F.2d\n                                                      \n\n1000, 1002 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"a court has an obligation to inquire\n\nsua sponte into its subject matter jurisdiction\").  The courts of\n          \n\nappeals  may  derive  jurisdiction  to review  a  district  court\n\nappellate order in a bankruptcy case from either of two statutory\n\nsources:  (1)  the bankruptcy  appeal provisions of  28 U.S.C.   \n\n158(d); or (2) the  interlocutory appeal provisions in  28 U.S.C.\n\n  1292 applicable  to civil  actions generally.   See Connecticut\n                                                                 \n\nNat'l Bank v.  Germain, 112 S. Ct. 1146 (1992).2   We trace these\n                      \n\navenues of appeal in turn.\n\n                    \n\n     2Germain  rejected  the widely  held view  that 28  U.S.C.  \n             \n158(d)  affords the only avenue  of appeal from  a district court\nappellate order in a  bankruptcy case.  Compare, e.g.,  In re GSF\n                                                                 \nCorp., 938 F.2d 1467, 1473 n.4 (1st Cir. 1991).\n     \n\n                                5\n\n                                6\n\nA.   Section 158(d)\n                   \n\n          Section 158(d) affords a right  of appeal to the courts\n\nof  appeals from  all  \"final decisions,  judgments, orders  [or]\n                             \n\ndecrees\"  entered by district courts in bankruptcy cases.  See 28\n                                                              \n\nU.S.C.   158(d)  (emphasis  added).   It  is often  difficult  to\n\ndetermine  what constitutes  a  \"final\" judgment  or order  under\n\nsection 158(d).  There is somewhat less difficulty in doing so in\n\nan adversary  proceeding, however, as the  finality determination\n\nin  such proceedings  \"closely resembles  [that] in  'an ordinary\n\ncase [between  the parties]  in a district  court.'\"  In  re Har-\n                                                                 \n\nrington, No.  92-2212 (1st Cir.

Co.,  898 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n                               \n\nAccordingly, a district court order in an adversary proceeding is\n\nnot  appealable as of  right under section 158(d)  unless it ends\n\nthe entire adversary proceeding \"on the merits and leaves nothing\n\nfor the court to do but enter the judgment.\"  See Stringfellow v.\n                                                              \n\nConcerned  Neighbors in Action, 480 U.S. 370, 375 (1987) (quoting\n                              \n\nCatlin v.

We\n\nadhere  to our earlier holding that an interlocutory order allow-\n\ning an  attachment to remain in place  is not an appealable \"col-\n\nlateral order,\" since  \"'the rights  of all parties  can be  ade-\n\nquately protected  while the  litigation on  the main  claim pro-\n\nceeds.'\"   Lowell Fruit Co. v.

Moreover, the validity\n\nof the  September 4 attachments  remains subject to  challenge on\n\neventual  appeal from  a  final judgment,  even  if the  claimant\n\nprevails.

Section 1292(b)\n                    \n\n          Finally, appellants' challenge to the September 4 order\n\npresents  no occasion  for interlocutory  review under  28 U.S.C.\n\n  1292(b), which permits  the courts of  appeals to entertain  an\n\ninterlocutory appeal  on a  district court's  certification \"that\n\n[the challenged]  order involves a controlling question of law as\n\nto which there  is substantial ground  for difference of  opinion\n\nand  that  an immediate  appeal  from  the  order may  materially\n\nadvance the  ultimate termination of  the litigation.\"   The dis-\n\ntrict  court did not purport to certify the September 4 order for\n\n                                11\n\nimmediate appeal,3 and,  in any case, a court  of appeals may not\n\nexercise  its discretion  to  entertain  an interlocutory  appeal\n\nunder section 1292(b) unless  the appellant requests it to  do so\n\nwithin  ten days  after entry  of the  district court  order from\n                \n\nwhich  appeal is  sought.

On the  one hand, the  \"cautionary notice,\"  a\n\ncreature of Puerto Rico  law, is roughly analogous to  the Anglo-\n\n                    \n\n     3The district court opinion  stated:  \"should the bankruptcy\ncourt's  orders be  deemed interlocutory,  we would  have granted\n                                                         \nleave to appeal  these orders because of  the important constitu-\ntional  issues they  raise.\"   144  B.R.  at 608,  n.4  (emphasis\nadded).  The quoted statement appears in a footnote discussion of\nthe  district court's interlocutory  appellate jurisdiction under\n                     \n28 U.S.C.   158(a).  See also 28 U.S.C.   157.  In relevant part,\n                             \n  158(a) states:  \"The district courts . . . shall have jurisdic-\ntion . . ., with leave of the [district] court, from interlocuto-\nry orders and decrees[] of bankruptcy judges entered in cases and\nproceedings referred  to the bankruptcy judges  under section 157\nof  this title.\"  Thus, in context, the district court's footnote\ndid  not  purport to  be a    1292(b)  certification, nor  did it\ncertify that \"an immediate  appeal [to the court of  appeals] may\nmaterially  advance the  ultimate  termination of  the litigation\n. . . .\"  28 U.S.C.   1292(b).\n\n                                12\n\nAmerican  notice  of lis  pendens, see  Cruz  La Corte  v.

On the other\n       \n\nhand, a \"prohibition against alienation\" seems closely akin to an\n\ninjunction;  it is directed to appellants personally, enforceable\n\nby contempt, and \"'designed to accord or protect,  some or all of\n\nthe  substantive relief  sought' in  the action.\"   Bogosian, 923\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  at 901 (quoting 16 Wright &amp; Miller    3922 at 10, 26).

See  Manchester\n                                                                 \n\nKnitted  Fashions, Inc.  v.

And it  is at\n\nleast  conceivable,  notwithstanding the  $1 million  surety bond\n\nposted by Goya, that appellants might be able to assert \"serious,\n\nperhaps irreparable\" consequences from the prohibition on aliena-\n\ntion of  properties having a  stated value approximating  $7 mil-\n\nlion.\n\n          We need not  delve into the matter, however,  as appel-\n\nlants' constitutional challenge to  the September 26 orders would\n\nfail on  the merits even if appealable  under section 1292(a)(1).\n\nSee  Norton v.  Mathews, 427  U.S. 524,  532 (1976)  (where party\n                       \n\nrequesting dismissal based on  lack of jurisdiction clearly would\n\nprevail  on the  merits,  court may  bypass close  jurisdictional\n\nquestion).    Appellants'  constitutional challenge  is  based on\n\nConnecticut  v. Doehr, 111 S.

Here, however,  appellants were given\n                \n\nnotice  and a hearing prior  to the issuance  of the September 26\n\norders.  At the hearing, Goya demonstrated a  reasonable \"likeli-\n\nhood of recovery,\" based on (1) the dates of appellants' purchase\n\nof  the various properties;  (2) sudden  changes in  the debtor's\n\ncash  position around  the times  of these purchases;  (3) appel-\n\nlants' repeated refusals to identify other sources of funding for\n\ntheir acquisition  of these properties;  (4) appellants' apparent\n\n                                14\n\nattempt  to remove assets from the jurisdiction at about the time\n\nGoya  commenced its  investigation into  the debtor's  connection\n\nwith those assets; and (5) the debtor's apparent past involvement\n\nin appellants'  financial affairs.   Appellants, for  their part,\n\npresented little  or no rebuttal evidence,  preferring to reserve\n\ntheir  right to  present  their case  at trial.   Doehr  does not\n                                                       \n\nrequire  a trial on the merits prior  to the issuance of a provi-\n\nsional remedy.   Appellants were afforded due process  before the\n\nSeptember 26  orders issued.  See  id.  We  therefore reserve for\n                                      \n\nanother day  the question  whether a \"cautionary  notice,\" linked\n\nwith  a \"prohibition  against  alienation\" of  real property,  is\n\nappealable as an injunction under 28 U.S.C.   1292(a)(1).\n\n                                IV\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n          The appeal  of the  September 4 order of  attachment is\n\ndismissed for  lack of jurisdiction, without  prejudice to appel-\n\nlants'  right to  renew their  constitutional challenge  upon the\n\nconclusion of the pending adversary proceeding.

Goya, a  creditor, charged\n\nthat  Unanue was continuing to  lead a life  of luxury, traveling\n\nbetween  seven \"fabulously  furnished\"  apartments  which he  had\n\nfraudulently transferred to Liliane, his wife, prior to bankrupt-\n\ncy.   After extensive discovery, Goya moved for leave to commence\n\nan adversary proceeding, in the name  and behalf of the chapter 7\n\nestate,  see  11 U.S.C.   503(b)(3)(B),  against  Liliane and  E-\n            \n\nmperor,  a shell  corporation apparently  controlled  by Liliane.\n\nAlthough  Liliane and Emperor were served with the Goya motion in\n\nJuly 1991, neither responded.\n\n          On August  24, 1991, Goya learned that Emperor had sold\n\none of Unanue's former  condominium apartments some months earli-\n\ner, in May  1991, netting approximately $400,000.   Goya promptly\n\n                                3\n\nrenewed its motion for leave to commence adversary proceedings on\n\nbehalf of the chapter  7 estate, and sought an immediate ex parte\n                                                                 \n\norder of attachment on the apartment-sale proceeds, alleging that\n\nthe  proceeds were assets of the chapter  7 estate and at risk of\n\nremoval from the jurisdiction.   On September 4, 1991, the  bank-\n\nruptcy court authorized Goya to commence an adversary proceeding,\n\nand  issued an  ex parte order  of attachment under  P.R. Rule 56\n                        \n\n(\"September 4  order\").1   On September 9,  Goya provided  appel-\n\nlants  with copies  of  the summons,  complaint,  and motion  for\n\nprovisional remedies.\n\n          In the course  of executing the writ  of attachment, it\n\nwas discovered  that Liliane had  transferred most of  the apart-\n\nment-sale proceeds  to a  Swiss bank  account.  On  September 12,\n\n1991, alarmed by the  apparent removal of the sale  proceeds from\n\nthe  jurisdiction, Goya  sought  additional provisional  remedies\n\nunder Rule 56, including  \"cautionary notices\" and a \"prohibition\n\nagainst alienation\" of  Liliane's remaining properties in  Puerto\n\nRico,  Paris, New  York and Spain.   After notice  to Liliane and\n\nEmperor, and a hearing  on appellants' constitutional claims, the\n\nbankruptcy  court authorized the  additional provisional remedies\n\non September 26 (\"September 26 orders\").\n\n                    \n\n     1Federal Rule  of Civil Procedure 64 is applicable in adver-\nsary proceedings.
