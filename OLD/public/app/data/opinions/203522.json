David    Morales-Machuca\n\n(\"Morales\") and Quester Sterling-Suárez (\"Sterling\") were indicted\n\nby a federal grand jury on multiple counts relating to an armored\n\ncar robbery in which a security guard was killed.        After an eight-\n\nday jury trial, both Morales and Sterling were found guilty as to\n\nall charged counts.     They were each sentenced to life terms of\n\nimprisonment.    Morales now appeals his conviction and sentence on\n\nvarious grounds.      Sterling appeals only his sentence.             After\n\ncareful consideration of the defendants' various arguments, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                           I.     Background\n\n          Morales   challenges     the   sufficiency    of   the   evidence\n\nsupporting his conviction.      We therefore rehearse the facts in the\n\nlight most favorable to the jury's guilty verdict, consistent with\n\nrecord support.    See United States v. Mousli, 511 F.3d 7, 14 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).\n\n          A.    The Robberies\n\n          On the morning of November 30, 2001, a Ranger American\n\nArmored Securities Services truck containing $180,000 arrived at\n\nthe Saulo de Rodríguez Credit Union in Gurabo, Puerto Rico.              As\n\nJames Cruz-Matías (\"Cruz\"), one of the two security officers\n\ndelivering the money, exited the truck and walked towards the\n\ncredit union, Hernando Medina-Villegas (\"Medina\") approached him\n\nwith a pistol in his hand.      Sterling and another assailant, both\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\farmed with pistols, appeared on either side of Cruz and threatened\n\nto shoot him.   The three assailants seized the bag with the money\n\nand fled in a dark-colored Jeep Grand Cherokee.             A short time\n\nlater, the police discovered a burned-out Grand Cherokee in the\n\narea.\n\n           Around noon on March 6, 2002, another armored truck\n\nattempted to deliver $300,000 to the Valenciano Cooperative in\n\nJuncos, Puerto Rico.       The truck was driven by security officer\n\nEluber Torres-Alejandro (\"Torres\"), who was accompanied by his\n\npartner,   Gilberto    Rodríguez-Cabrera   (\"Rodríguez\").     As   Torres\n\nwalked toward the credit union, Lorenzo Catalán-Román (\"Catalán\")\n\napproached with a firearm to demand the money.              The robbery,\n\nhowever, failed.      Torres pulled out a firearm and Rodríguez opened\n\nthe truck door and aimed another gun at Catalán.       Catalán turned\n\nand fled. Torres observed that as Catalán ran away, a motorcyclist\n\nwho had lingered behind the truck and a blue Chevy Lumina with\n\ntinted windows both sped away.\n\n           On the morning of March 27, 2002, Torres and Rodríguez\n\nattempted to make another delivery, this time $100,000 to the Saulo\n\nde Rodríguez Credit Union in Gurabo, Puerto Rico.      However, before\n\nRodríguez reached the front door of the credit union, Medina and\n\nCatalán approached with pistols in their hands.      Rodríguez made no\n\nresistance and raised his hands, but Medina fired a shot from a\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fGlock 9mm pistol and Rodríguez fell back against the building\n\nwindow.\n\n          Hearing the gunfire, Torres opened the truck door and\n\nshot Catalán in the leg.    Torres's hand was then hit by a bullet\n\nfrom an unseen shooter.    Injured, he climbed back into the truck.\n\nAs Rodríguez begged for his life, Medina took the bag of money and\n\nfired another shot at him. Medina fled, leaving an injured Catalán\n\nbehind.   Catalán then picked up his pistol and fired six shots at\n\nRodríguez, who was lying prone on the ground and begging for mercy.\n\nRodríguez died as a result of gun shot wounds.\n\n          Soon thereafter, Sterling appeared from the drive-through\n\narea with a gun in his hand.       Sterling attempted to help the\n\ninjured Catalán, but fled when the police arrived.       One officer\n\narrested Catalán and another chased, but then lost, Sterling in the\n\nnearby wooded area.   A few hours later, a wet and dirty Sterling,\n\nwho was sitting on the side of the road near the credit union, was\n\narrested by the police.       After being advised of his rights,\n\nSterling confessed to participating in the robbery and throwing\n\naside his gun as he fled from the police.    He described how he had\n\nbeen picked up early that morning and had waited in the parking lot\n\nfor the armored truck to arrive.       He also confessed that he had\n\nparticipated in other robberies with the same group of people.\n\n          Nearby, the police recovered a stolen green Ford Explorer\n\nthat contained the Glock 9mm pistol used by Medina to shoot\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fRodríguez, as well as eleven shell casings and a bullet fragment.\n\nAt trial, the government's ballistics expert testified that the\n\ncasings, fragment, and the bullet from Torres's injured hand were\n\nall traced to a Taurus 9mm pistol that belonged to Morales.\n\n              B.   Morales\n\n              Between June 2000 and March 2002, Morales worked as a\n\ntruck driver and received minimum wage.           His gross weekly pay was\n\napproximately $200.          In 2001, he and his wife, Minerva Núñez-\n\nMorales, reported a total gross annual income of $11,342 on their\n\ntax forms.         In 2001, Morales became romantically involved with\n\nJocelyn Serrano-Castro (\"Serrano\").          According to Serrano, Morales\n\nwas   close    friends   with    Medina,    Catalán,   Sterling,   and   Pablo\n\nSánchez-Rodríguez (\"Sánchez\").\n\n              Despite his relatively modest income, Morales was able to\n\nbuy cars for both his wife and Serrano.           On or about December 10,\n\n2001, Morales purchased a 1993 blue Chevy Lumina for Serrano after\n\ntelling her that he had \"scored a big hit.\"            On December 18, 2001,\n\nMorales's wife inspected a 1996 green Chevy Lumina, called Morales\n\nto report that the car was in good condition, and then paid the\n\nseller $5,000 in cash.          And then in April 2002, he paid for more\n\nthan half the $7,200 price of a 1994 blue Grand Marquis.\n\n              The blue Chevy Lumina, however, was taken away from\n\nSerrano some time in February 2002, one month before the second\n\nrobbery. The pair had a fight and Morales allegedly struck Serrano\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fin the head with a Taurus 9mm pistol that he always carried with\n\nhim.    Morales later forced Serrano to transfer the car to Medina.\n\nAt trial, Serrano testified that although the car belonged to\n\nMedina, she had never seen him drive it.           Morales almost always\n\ndrove   the    car.   Medina   owned   other   means   of   transportation,\n\nincluding a motorcycle.\n\n              Serrano testified in great detail regarding the events of\n\nMarch 27, 2002, the day of the fatal armed robbery.             She related\n\nhow Morales came to pick her up around 9:00 a.m. in a blue Chevy\n\nLumina.       When she expressed some surprise at the early hour,\n\nMorales told her that the \"guys had scored a hit and he did not\n\ntrust the person that was going to pick them up.\"           He told her that\n\n\"the guys had called him so he would go pick them up.\"           They drove\n\nto Gurabo where Sánchez was waiting.       The two men parked their cars\n\nand talked for about 15-20 minutes in Sánchez's vehicle.                 As\n\nSerrano and Morales were driving back to Bayamón, he received a\n\ncall from Sánchez.      Morales then called his wife and switched cars\n\n-- the green Chevy Lumina for the blue Chevy Lumina.\n\n              A few hours later, Morales picked up Serrano and drove to\n\na Wendy's parking lot in Caguas.         Serrano testified that Morales\n\nmet with Sánchez and another individual, who gave Morales a duffel\n\nbag containing cash. Later that evening, Morales and Serrano drove\n\nback to the Gurabo area and stopped at a mile-marker on the edge of\n\nthe highway.      Morales stepped out of the car, reached behind the\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fmile-marker, and retrieved his Taurus 9mm pistol.          They then drove\n\nto a shopping mall and purchased two new cell phones.\n\n            The following day, March 28th, Morales and Serrano went\n\nto visit Medina.     Serrano observed that the apartment was full of\n\nnew furniture and Medina responded that \"they had scored a big hit\n\nand that they were buying everything new.\"            A couple of weeks\n\nlater, Morales paid for half the cost of a 1994 blue Grand Marquis.\n\n            On April 17, 2002, Morales and Serrano were driving in\n\nthe Grand Marquis when they were stopped by the police for driving\n\nwith    tinted   windows.   Morales   hid   the   Taurus   9mm   pistol   in\n\nSerrano's purse, but the police discovered the loaded gun and\n\narrested both Morales and Serrano.          Morales told the arresting\n\nofficer that the gun belonged to him.\n\n            C.   Jury Trial and Sentencing\n\n            Morales, Sterling, and three co-defendants were charged\n\nin a ten-count indictment.    Morales and Sterling were both charged\n\nwith:    Count One, conspiring to obstruct commerce by robbery, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a);1 Count Two, aiding and abetting\n\n\n\n1\n    18 U.S.C. § 1951(a) reads:\n\n       Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or\n       affects commerce or the movement of any article or\n       commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or\n       attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens\n       physical violence to any person or property in\n       furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in\n       violation of this section shall be fined under this title\n       or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fin    the   knowing   possession,   use,    or   carrying   of   firearms   in\n\nfurtherance or during and in relation to the conspiracy alleged in\n\nCount One, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(iii)2 and 2;3\n\nCount Seven, aiding and abetting in the March 27, 2002 robbery of\n\napproximately $100,000, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951(a) and 2;\n\nCount    Eight,   aiding   and   abetting   in   the   knowing    possession,\n\nbrandishing, use, or carrying of firearms during and in relation to\n\nthe    robbery,   which    unlawfully   killed     Rodríguez     with   malice\n\naforethought, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(j)4 and 2; Count\n\n\n2\n     18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) reads:\n\n       [A]ny person who, during and in relation to any crime of\n       violence or drug trafficking crime . . . , uses or\n       carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such\n       crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the\n       punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug\n       trafficking crime, if the firearm is discharged, be\n       sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10\n       years.\n3\n     18 U.S.C. § 2 reads:\n\n       (a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States\n       or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures\n       its commission, is punishable as a principal. (b) Whoever\n       willfully causes an act to be done which if directly\n       performed by him or another would be an offense against\n       the United States, is punishable as a principal.\n4\n     18 U.S.C. § 924(j) reads:\n\n       A person who, in the course of a violation of subsection\n       (c), causes the death of a person through the use of a\n       firearm, shall: (1) if the killing is a murder (as\n       defined in section 1111), be punished by death or by\n       imprisonment for any term of years or for life; and (2)\n       if the killing is manslaughter (as defined in section\n       1112), be punished as provided in that section.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fNine, aiding and abetting in the knowing possession, brandishing,\n\nuse,   or   carrying   of   firearms    during   and   in   relation   to   the\n\nMarch 27, 2002 robbery alleged in Count Seven, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) and 2.           Additionally, Sterling was\n\ncharged with: Count Three, aiding and abetting in the November 30,\n\n2001 robbery of more than $100,000, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n1951(a) and 2, and Count Four, aiding and abetting in knowing\n\npossession, use or carrying of firearms in furtherance or during\n\nand in relation to the November 30, 2001 robbery, in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) and 2.            Morales additionally was\n\ncharged in Count Ten with being a felon in possession of a firearm,\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2).5\n\n            Morales and Sterling pleaded not guilty and the two went\n\nto trial on August 29, 2005.            The government's first witness,\n\nTorres, testified about both the March 27, 2002 robbery and the\n\nMarch 6, 2002 attempted robbery. Counsel objected to the testimony\n\nregarding the attempted robbery.         The district court overruled the\n\nobjection and allowed the testimony.\n\n            After the presentation of the government's case-in-chief,\n\ndefense counsel filed for judgments of acquittal on nearly all\n\ncounts.6    After limited oral argument, the court denied the Rule 29\n\n\n\n5\n  Morales had a prior 1996 attempted murder felony conviction from\nPuerto Rico that had resulted in a two-year term of incarceration.\n6\n    Morales's counsel stated that he would not contest Count Ten.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fmotions.      Morales presented an expert witness, a firearms and\n\nballistics consultant, who testified that in his opinion, the\n\nvarious    rounds      and   casings    submitted   into    evidence   by    the\n\ngovernment were not fired by the Taurus pistol.                The defendants\n\nrested and failed to renew their Rule 29 motions.             On September 9,\n\n2005,   the    jury    returned   a    verdict,   finding   both   Morales   and\n\nSterling guilty on all counts.          There was no renewal of the Rule 29\n\nmotions following the verdict.\n\n              On December 12, 2005, Sterling was sentenced to: twenty-\n\nyear terms as to each of Counts One, Three, and Seven, to be served\n\nconcurrently; thirty-year terms as to each of Counts Two and Nine,\n\nto be served concurrently to each other and to the sentence in\n\nCount Four, but consecutively to the other counts; a twenty-one\n\nyear term as to Count Four; and a life term of imprisonment as to\n\nCount Eight.          On January 11, 2006, Morales was sentenced to:\n\ntwenty-year terms each as to Counts One and Seven and a ten-year\n\nminimum as to Count Ten, to be served concurrently with one\n\nanother; thirty-year terms each as to Counts Two and Nine, to be\n\nserved concurrently with each other, but consecutively to the other\n\ncounts; and a life term of imprisonment as to Count Eight.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f                              II.    Discussion\n\n           A.    Morales's Rule 29 Challenge\n\n           On appeal, Morales challenges the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence underlying the jury's guilty verdict on Counts One, Two,\n\nSeven, Eight, and Nine.        He argues that the government failed to\n\ndemonstrate his involvement in the conspiracy to commit robbery or\n\nin the carrying and use of a firearm in furtherance of that\n\nconspiracy.     With respect to Count Eight, he further argues that\n\nthe government failed to prove that he had the requisite malice\n\naforethought     in   the   commission     of    the    murder.      He     does   not\n\nchallenge his conviction for possessing a firearm as a felon (Count\n\nTen).\n\n           At the close of the government's case-in-chief, Morales\n\nmoved for a judgment of acquittal.              The district court denied the\n\nmotion.    After the presentation of the defendants' case, Morales\n\nfailed to renew his motion.          The jury returned a guilty verdict.\n\nIn the seven days following the verdict, Morales did not renew his\n\nmotion.    See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(c)(1).                    As we have cautioned\n\ndefendants in the past, \"[t]hese omissions combine to constitute a\n\nwaiver of [Morales's] earlier Rule 29 motion.\"                   United States v.\n\nMaldonado-García, 446 F.3d 227, 230 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing United\n\nStates    v.    Hadfield,    918    F.2d     987,      996    (1st   Cir.    1990)).\n\nAccordingly, we review only for \"clear and gross injustice.\"                       Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\f          In   evaluating      Morales's       challenge    to    evidentiary\n\nsufficiency,   we   consider   whether     a   rational    jury   could   have\n\nconcluded that the government proved each element of the charged\n\noffenses beyond a reasonable doubt.             In so doing, we view the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the jury's guilty verdict\n\nand \"resolve all questions of credibility and reasonable inferences\n\nin favor of the verdict.\"      United States v. Lizardo, 445 F.3d 73,\n\n81 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing United States v. Ruiz, 105 F.3d 1492,\n\n1495 (1st Cir. 1997)).    \"[D]efendants challenging convictions for\n\ninsufficiency of evidence face an uphill battle on appeal.\" United\n\nStates v. O'Shea, 426 F.3d 475, 479 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Hernández, 218 F.3d 58, 64 (1st Cir. 2000)).               Applying\n\nthat standard with a focus on whether there was error engendering\n\nclear and gross injustice in this case, we conclude that there was\n\nno such injustice here.\n\n                    1.   Obstructing Interstate Commerce through\n                    Robbery\n\n          Looking first to the two Hobbs Act violations, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1951(a), the government had to prove that Morales conspired\n\n(Count One) and aided and abetted (Count Seven) to obstruct, delay,\n\nor affect commerce by robbery.       The Act defines robbery as \"the\n\nunlawful taking or obtaining of personal property from the person\n\nor in the presence of another, against his will, by means of actual\n\nor threatened force.\"     Id. § 1951(b)(1).        A Hobbs Act conspiracy\n\nrequires the government to prove \"an intent to agree and an intent\n\n                                  -12-\n\fto commit the substantive offense.\"             United States v. Palmer, 203\n\nF.3d   55,   63    (1st   Cir.    2000).7      In   carrying    its   burden,    the\n\ngovernment can use \"circumstantial evidence, and the government\n\nneed   only       demonstrate      a   tacit    understanding         between    the\n\nconspirators to prove its case.\"            Id. at 64.\n\n             On appeal, Morales contends that the government failed to\n\ndemonstrate that he participated in the alleged robberies and\n\nconspiracy.        The government concedes that it presented no direct\n\nevidence     of    Morales's     participation      in   the   robberies,   as    no\n\nwitnesses identified Morales at the scene of either robbery.                     The\n\ngovernment        counters,    however,     that    it    presented     sufficient\n\ncircumstantial evidence to support a finding of guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.         See United States v. Llinas, 373 F.3d 26, 31\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (citing United States v. Gómez-Pabón, 911 F.2d 847,\n\n853 (1st Cir. 1990)); see also United States v. Valerio, 48 F.3d\n\n58, 63 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"[T]he government's proof may lay entirely\n\nin circumstantial evidence.\") (citation omitted).                 We agree.\n\n\n\n7\n   Morales does not contest the interstate commerce element in his\nappeal.   In any event, the record clearly establishes that the\ngovernment made the requisite showing. Under the Hobbs Act, the\n\"government need only show that the robbery created 'a realistic\nprobability of a de minimis effect on interstate commerce.'\"\nUnited States v. DeCologero, 530 F.3d 36, 68 (1st Cir. 2008)\n(quoting United States v. Capozzi, 347 F.3d 327, 335 (1st Cir.\n2003)). In this case, the President of Ranger American Armored\nSecurities Services testified that the losses resulting from the\nrobberies affected his ability to make purchases in the United\nStates to operate his business.       Accordingly, the robberies\nresulted in a sufficient impact on commerce.\n\n                                       -13-\n\f            First, the jury heard testimony that Morales earned a\n\nminimum wage salary, yet was able to purchase several thousand\n\ndollars worth of cars for his wife and girlfriend.               In December\n\n2001, he purchased a green 1996 Chevy Lumina for his wife.                 In\n\nDecember 2001, he also purchased a blue 1993 Chevy Lumina for\n\nSerrano.    And then in April 2002, he was involved in the purchase\n\nof a blue 1994 Grand Marquis.8         Morales paid for these purchases in\n\ncash.      With   respect   to   the   March   27,   2002   robbery,   Serrano\n\ntestified that Morales picked up a duffel bag containing a sum of\n\ncash after a meeting in a Wendy's parking lot.                The government\n\nargues that, in addition to this suspicious influx of cash, the\n\ntiming of these car purchases coincided with the commission of the\n\ntwo robberies:     November 2001 and March 2002.\n\n            Second, Serrano testified that on March 27, 2002, Morales\n\ntold her that \"the guys had scored a hit and . . . the guys had\n\ncalled him so that he would go pick them up.\"          That day, they drove\n\nalong the road to Gurabo and Morales retrieved his Taurus 9mm\n\npistol from behind a specific highway mile-marker. With respect to\n\nthe pistol, the jury heard from the government's firearm expert who\n\ntestified that the gun was used to fire the eleven casings found on\n\nthe floor of the Ford Explorer found abandoned near the scene of\n\n\n\n8\n  The government's witness, an automobile dealer at Yamilisy Auto\nSales, testified that a woman, Marisol Ríos Matías, and a man\npurchased the blue 1994 Grand Marquis for $7,200. The purchase was\nentirely in cash, with more than half provided by Morales.\n\n                                       -14-\n\fthe March 27 robbery.     Ballistics reports also linked the gun to\n\nthe bullet that had struck Torres's hand during the robbery shoot-\n\nout.\n\n          Based on this evidence, a reasonable jury could have\n\nconcluded that Morales participated in the conspiracy to obstruct\n\ninterstate commerce through robbery (Count One), and aided and\n\nabetted the commission of the March 27, 2002 robbery (Count Seven).\n\nWhile a large portion of the evidence submitted to the jury\n\nregarding Morales's role in the offense is based primarily on\n\nSerrano's testimony, the jury reasonably credited her account of\n\nthe events.   It is not for us to make credibility determinations in\n\nthe course of a review of the sufficiency of the evidence.       Our\n\ntask is only to determine whether a rational jury could have\n\nbelieved the testimony.    See United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707,\n\n711 (1st Cir. 1992).    Here, a rational jury could have and did so.\n\n                   2. Carrying or Use of Firearm During Crime of\n                   Violence\n\n          Under the firearms statute relating to Counts Two and\n\nNine, the government had to shoulder the burden of proving that\n\nMorales aided and abetted in the use or carrying of a firearm\n\n\"during and in relation to any crime of violence.\"   18 U.S.C. § 924\n\n(c)(1)(A).    A violation of the Hobbs Act is a crime of violence for\n\npurposes of this statutory provision.    See, e.g., United States v.\n\nRodríguez-Casiano, 425 F.3d 12, 13 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\f            On April 17, 2002, Morales and Serrano were pulled over\n\nfor   a   traffic   violation   and   then    arrested   when   the   police\n\ndiscovered a gun in Serrano's purse.         After being duly informed of\n\nhis rights, Morales told the police that the gun belonged to him.\n\nAt trial, Serrano testified that Morales almost always carried the\n\nTaurus 9mm gun with him.        She also testified that on March 27,\n\nMorales retrieved the gun from behind a mile-marker on the highway\n\nto Gurabo.     Additionally, the government presented ballistics\n\nevidence linking the Taurus 9mm gun to both the casings and the\n\nbullet fired into Torres's hand during the March 27, 2002 robbery.\n\nWhile the government proffered no direct evidence that Morales had\n\nknowingly supplied or given the gun to those physically involved in\n\nthe robbery that morning, a jury could make such an inference on\n\nthe basis of the testimony regarding the post-robbery events.            In\n\nany event, we review this sufficiency claim only for clear and\n\ngross injustice as a result of Morales's failure to renew his Rule\n\n29 motion.    Morales's scarcely developed argument falls short of\n\nthat required showing.\n\n                    3. Aiding and Abetting in the Use of a Firearm\n                    During a Violent Crime, Which Unlawfully Killed\n                    Rodríguez\n\n            In order to sustain a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(j)(1),\n\nthe government had to demonstrate that Morales aided and abetted\n\nthe use of a firearm in committing a crime of violence, and in the\n\ncourse of that violation caused the murder of Rodríguez through the\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fuse of the firearm.      A violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a) is a crime\n\nof violence.    See, e.g., United States v. Jiménez-Torres, 435 F.3d\n\n3, 10 (1st Cir. 2006).     For the purposes of this violation, murder\n\nis defined as the \"unlawful killing of a human being with malice\n\naforethought.\"     18 U.S.C. § 1111.        That provision goes on to\n\nenumerate a list of murders categorized as murder in the first\n\ndegree, including \"murder . . . committed in the perpetration of\n\n. . . robbery.\"    Id.\n\n             In his appeal, Morales contends that the government\n\nfailed to establish the malice element of the offense.       He argues\n\nthat the evidence in the record establishes only that there was a\n\n\"robbery, that things got out of hand, a shooting ensued and a\n\ndeath resulted.\"    Morales's argument is unavailing under our case\n\nlaw.   In United States v. Shea, 211 F.3d 658 (1st Cir. 2000), we\n\nconcluded that 18 U.S.C. § 1111 \"was intended to adopt the felony\n\nmurder rule, and for a stated felony the 'malice' element is\n\nsatisfied by the intent to commit the unlawful felony.\"      Id. at 674\n\n(citing cases).\n\n             The government presented evidence at trial that Morales\n\naided and abetted in a conspiracy to commit and the commission of\n\nthe March 27, 2002 armed robbery.        That morning, Medina, Catalán,\n\nand Sterling waited for the armored truck with the intent to commit\n\na robbery.    The group was armed with pistols and, in the course of\n\nthe robbery, Medina and Catalán shot and killed Rodríguez.       Under\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\f18 U.S.C. § 1111, the killing of Rodríguez was \"first-degree murder\n\nby those who perpetrated the robbery, regardless of who pulled the\n\ntrigger or any individual intent.\"               Id.     Having concluded that a\n\nreasonably jury could find that Morales aided and abetted in the\n\ncommission of the robbery and in the use of the firearm, it follows\n\nthat his conviction for murder is reasonable as well.\n\n             Based   on     the    record    evidence,        we   conclude      that   a\n\nreasonable jury could have found Morales guilty beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt of all of the charged offenses.                He therefore fails to make\n\nthe   more    difficult      showing       of    clear    and      gross    injustice.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of his Rule 29\n\nmotion.\n\n             B.   Morales's Evidentiary Challenge\n\n             Morales also argues that the district court erred in\n\nadmitting Torres's testimony regarding the March 6, 2002 attempted\n\nrobbery.     He contends that the testimony was unfairly prejudicial\n\nand   outweighed     its    probative       value.       In    general,     we   review\n\nevidentiary       rulings     by    the     district      court      regarding      the\n\nadmissibility of evidence for an abuse of discretion.                       See United\n\nStates v. Barrow, 448 F.3d 37, 42 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing United\n\nStates v. Cruz, 352 F.3d 499, 504 (1st Cir. 2003)).                        Even if the\n\ndistrict court erred in admitting the evidence, we review only for\n\nprejudicial error.        See United States v. Shea, 159 F.3d 37, 40 (1st\n\nCir. 1998) (\"[A] non-constitutional evidentiary issue will be\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\ftreated as harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not\n\ncontribute to the verdict.\" (quoting United States v. Rose, 104\n\nF.3d 1408, 1414 (1st Cir. 1997))).\n\n            The district court denied Morales's objection and agreed\n\nwith the government's argument that the evidence was sufficiently\n\nconnected to the conspiracy: \"[I]t is not only the similarity of\n\nthe modus operandi and the participants, but it's also the fact\n\nthat they are targeting       . . . the same armored car company . . .\n\nthe same route . . . and it is about three weeks prior to the\n\nMarch 27th robbery.\"      According to the testimony of Torres, on\n\nMarch 6, 2002, he and his partner were delivering $300,000 to the\n\nValenciano Credit Union, and narrowly avoided being robbed. Torres\n\ntestified that his would-be assailant -- later identified as\n\nLorenzo Catalán, who was involved in the March 27, 2002 robbery --\n\napproached him as he was making his way to the front door of the\n\ncredit union.   He and his partner Rodríguez drew their weapons and\n\nCatalán fled.     Torres testified that immediately thereafter, a\n\nsuspicious man on a motorcycle who had been lingering behind the\n\ntruck sped away and a blue Chevy Lumina with tinted windows also\n\nsped out of the parking lot.\n\n            At trial, the government asserted that the two charged\n\nrobberies -- on November 30 and March 27 -- were part of a\n\nconspiracy to obstruct commerce through robbery.           The government\n\npresented   evidence   that    the   robberies   evinced   the   following\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fsimilarities: early morning deliveries to Gurabo-area credit unions\n\nby Ranger American Armored Securities Services trucks; one or two\n\narmed assailants, with unseen others providing cover; and the\n\nparticipation of the same individuals.                See United States v.\n\nMorrow,    39   F.3d   1228,    1233-34   (1st    Cir.   1994)    (resolving    a\n\nsufficiency challenge by looking to the nature of the scheme,\n\nidentity of participants and victims, and commonality in timing and\n\ngoals in a series of transactions in an alleged conspiracy).                   In\n\nfurther support of its case, the government offered the testimony\n\nof Torres who testified to the events of March 6, 2002, that\n\nexhibited the same modus operandi.              Moreover, the jury had also\n\nheard Serrano's testimony that Morales had taken the blue Lumina\n\nfrom her about a month before the robbery, and that his confederate\n\nMedina drove a motorcycle.\n\n            We conclude that the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in concluding that the probative value of the testimony\n\noutweighed the risk of unfair prejudice. To prove that Morales and\n\nSterling    were   guilty      of   violating   18   U.S.C.   §   1951(a),   the\n\ngovernment was required to prove that the defendants had conspired\n\nto obstruct commerce by robbery.              This evidentiary burden made\n\nevidence of other actions taken in furtherance of that conspiracy\n\nprobative.      See United States v. Medina, 761 F.2d 12, 15 (1st Cir.\n\n1985).     Although the testimony linking Morales to the March 6th\n\nattempted robbery was by no means overwhelming, the court was\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\fwithin its discretion in deeming it admissible as a means of\n\nproving the charged conspiracy.       Indeed, given that we will only\n\nreverse a district court's \"on-the-spot judgment\" regarding the\n\nbalance of probative value and unfair effect in \"extraordinarily\n\ncompelling circumstances,\" we are unconvinced that this case gives\n\nus reason to do so.    United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1339\n\n(1st Cir. 1994) (quoting United States v. Rodríguez-Estrada, 877\n\nF.2d 153, 155-56 (1st Cir. 1989)).9\n\n          C.   Morales's Sentencing Challenge\n\n          Morales   appeals   the    district   court's   denial   of   his\n\nrequest for a downward adjustment for a minor role.         Prior to his\n\nsentencing hearing, he objected to the Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\"),\n\narguing that he was entitled to a minor role adjustment under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.2(b).    The government disagreed and argued that\n\nMorales could not be characterized as the least culpable in view of\n\nhis role supplying the gun and sharing in the proceeds.                 The\n\ndistrict court denied the request for minor-role adjustment.\n\n          Unless there is a mistake of law, we review a district\n\ncourt's denial of downward adjustment for clear error.         See United\n\nStates v. Bravo, 489 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2007).          Given the fact-\n\n\n\n9\n   Moreover, even if the district court had erred in admitting the\ntestimony, we would conclude that such error was harmless. The\ntestimony about the March 6th attempted robbery was brief and\ncumulative. Morales's guilt in this case turned, in significant\npart, on the credibility of Serrano's testimony and the testimony\nlinking Morales's Taurus 9mm gun to the March 27, 2002 shooting.\n\n                                    -21-\n\fspecific    nature   of   a    defendant's   status   determination,    great\n\ndeference    is   given   to   the   district   court:   \"[B]attles    over   a\n\ndefendant's status . . . will almost always be won or lost in the\n\ndistrict court.\"      United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 31 (1st\n\nCir. 2001) (quoting United States v. Conley, 156 F.3d 78, 85 (1st\n\nCir. 1998)); see also United States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70, 75\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (same).\n\n            Under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2, a defendant can qualify as a\n\nminor participant and receive a two-level reduction in his base\n\noffense level if he proves by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\nhe was \"less culpable than most other participants.\"              Id. cmt. 5;\n\nsee also United States v. García, 954 F.2d 12, 18 (1st Cir. 1992)\n\n(defendant    seeking     downward   adjustment   carries   the    burden     of\n\nproof).     Less culpable, however, does not simply mean that the\n\ndefendant was not the leader.        The defendant must be \"not only less\n\nculpable than h[is] cohorts in the particular criminal endeavor,\n\nbut also less culpable than the majority of those within the\n\nuniverse of persons participating in similar crimes.\"             Teeter, 257\n\nF.3d at 30-31 (citing United States v. Murphy, 193 F.3d 1, 9 (1st\n\nCir. 1999)).\n\n            Here, Morales contends that he was a minor participant\n\nwhen contrasted with the other participants who were \"organizers,\n\nsupervisors, [and] physically participated in the robbery and the\n\nshootout which resulted in a death.\" At the sentencing hearing, he\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fconceded   that    he   was    not   the   least   culpable   --   Sánchez   was\n\nadmittedly at the bottom of the hierarchy -- but, he also argued\n\nthat he should be considered a minor participant because he was not\n\nthe most culpable.       The district court denied the request.              The\n\ncourt determined that Morales's role in the offense was more\n\nsignificant than that of a mere minor participant, indeed the court\n\nfound him to be \"intimately involved.\"             Morales was in telephonic\n\ncontact with the other defendants who were physically participating\n\nin the robbery; was supposed to pick-up the defendants after the\n\nMarch 27, 2002 robbery; supplied the Taurus 9mm pistol that shot\n\nTorres in the hand during the shoot-out; and enjoyed a share of the\n\nstolen money.      Based on the record, the district court reasonably\n\nconcluded that Morales's role \"outstripped the . . . 'minor' rungs\n\non the hierarchical ladder of blameworthiness.\"               García, 954 F.2d\n\nat 18.   We thus find no error in the district court's denial of the\n\ndownward role-in-the-offense adjustment.\n\n           D.     Sterling's Sentencing Challenge\n\n           On September 9, 2005, the jury found Sterling guilty on\n\nall charged counts.           At his sentencing hearing on November 17,\n\n2006, he was sentenced to: twenty-year terms as to Counts One,\n\nThree, and Seven, to be served concurrently; thirty-year terms as\n\nto Counts Two and Nine, to be served concurrently to each other and\n\nthe sentence in Count Four, but consecutively to the others counts;\n\n\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fa    twenty-one    year    term    as    to     Count   Four;   and   a   life    term\n\nimprisonment as to Count Eight.10\n\n            Our review of a district court's sentence is a two-step\n\nprocess,    with    both    a     substantive        and   procedural     component.\n\nSee United States v. Politano, 522 F.3d 69, 72 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(citing Gall v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 586, 597 (2007); United\n\nStates v. Martin, 520 F.3d 87, 91-93 (1st Cir. 2008)).                            With\n\nrespect to our procedural inquiry, we look to whether the district\n\ncourt    properly    calculated         the    Guidelines    range,     treated   the\n\nGuidelines as advisory, considered the various 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)\n\nfactors, and adequately explained the chosen sentence.                      See id.\n\n(citing Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 597).               In this case, the district court\n\nmade the appropriate Guidelines calculations for all counts and\n\nconsidered the proper statutory factors.\n\n            Having found no procedural error, we next turn to the\n\nsubstantive   reasonableness            of    the   defendant's   sentence.        See\n\nPolitano, 522 F.3d at 72.            We review under a highly deferential\n\nabuse of discretion standard.                 See id. (citations omitted); see\n\nalso Martin, 520 F.3d at 96 (\"[T]he linchpin of a reasonableness\n\n\n\n\n10\n   Sterling was first sentenced on December 12, 2005. Three months\nafter his sentencing hearing, he filed a motion requesting\nresentencing because he had not fully understood his right of\nallocution.    The court held a second sentencing hearing on\nNovember 17, 2006.    After being duly informed of his right of\nallocution, Sterling declined to exercise it.       The court then\nimposed the same sentence.\n\n                                             -24-\n\fsentence is a plausible sentencing rationale and a defensible\n\noverall result.\").\n\n           Sterling's challenge to the substantive reasonableness of\n\nhis life sentence faces an uphill battle.              A sentence within the\n\napplicable Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.              See Rita\n\nv. United States, 127 S. Ct. 2456, 2463 (2007) (\"[T]he presumption\n\nreflects the fact that, by the time an appeals court is considering\n\na within-Guidelines sentence on review, both the sentencing judge\n\nand the Sentencing Commission will have reached the same conclusion\n\nas to the proper sentence in the particular case.\") (emphasis in\n\noriginal).     Here, Sterling's sentence of life imprisonment was\n\nbased on his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(j). Under the\n\nGuidelines, a § 924(j) offense (assuming the application, as in\n\nthis case, of U.S.S.G. § 2A1.1) has a base offense level of forty-\n\nthree, which corresponds to a recommended sentence of a life term\n\nof imprisonment.\n\n           Sterling first argues that the sentence was unreasonable\n\nbecause he was not the one to shoot Rodríguez.                This argument is\n\nmeritless.     While Sterling was not the actual shooter, the jury\n\nfound   that   he   had   aided   and   abetted   in    two    separate   armed\n\nrobberies: in the first, Sterling was one of two assailants who\n\nthreatened to shoot the security officer; and in the second, the\n\nevidence (indeed his own confession) linked him to the robbery that\n\nresulted in Rodríguez's death. Indeed, with respect to his role in\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fthe robbery, the PSR stated that Sterling was \"providing cover for\n\nthe other assailants while they shot Mr. Rodríguez.\"\n\n           Second, he argues that the district court should have\n\nafforded greater weight to his personal background and lack of\n\ncriminal history.     He argues that the court failed to consider\n\nwhether a life sentence was appropriate for a twenty-seven year old\n\ndefendant with a tenth grade education and no prior criminal\n\nhistory.   Looking to the terms of incarceration imposed for all of\n\nthe other charges, he posits that the fifty years he received was\n\nmore than sufficient to administer just punishment, reflect the\n\nseriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, afford\n\nadequate   deterrence,   and   protect   the   public.     See   18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(a).   He argues that the imposition of a life sentence for\n\nCount Eight was unnecessary.\n\n           While we might have imposed a lesser sentence in this\n\ncase if we were sitting as the sentencing court, that is not a\n\nbasis for reversal.      We afford broad discretion to the district\n\ncourt in affixing the appropriate sentence and we recognize that\n\n\"there is not a single reasonable sentence but, rather, a range of\n\nreasonable sentences.\"    Martin, 520 F.3d at 92.        This is a case in\n\nwhich the district judge who had presided over trial was intimately\n\nfamiliar with the facts and the particular acts attributed to the\n\ndefendant.   After hearing argument from counsel on the § 3553(a)\n\nfactors, the district court stated that it had considered them all\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\fand announced its sentence.          While the court's explanation was by\n\nno means lengthy, we have held that a sentencing court is \"not\n\nrequired to address those factors, one by one, in some sort of rote\n\nincantation when explicating its sentencing decision.\"                United\n\nStates v. Dixon, 449 F.3d 194, 205 (1st Cir. 2006); see also United\n\nStates v. Brandao, 539 F.3d 44, 65 (1st Cir. 2008).               The trial\n\nrecord makes evident that Sterling was involved in a serious armed\n\nrobbery that resulted in the violent death of an innocent security\n\nguard.   We are unable to conclude that the Guidelines sentence\n\nimposed here \"falls outside the expansive boundaries of that\n\nuniverse\"   of   reasonable    sentences.      Martin,   520   F.3d   at   92.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court's sentence.\n\n                              III.    Conclusion\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Morales-Machuca's\n\nconviction and sentence and affirm Sterling-Suárez's sentence.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\f",

The Robberies\n\n          On the morning of November 30, 2001, a Ranger American\n\nArmored Securities Services truck containing $180,000 arrived at\n\nthe Saulo de Rodríguez Credit Union in Gurabo, Puerto Rico.              As\n\nJames Cruz-Matías (\"Cruz\"), one of the two security officers\n\ndelivering the money, exited the truck and walked towards the\n\ncredit union, Hernando Medina-Villegas (\"Medina\") approached him\n\nwith a pistol in his hand.      Sterling and another assailant, both\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\farmed with pistols, appeared on either side of Cruz and threatened\n\nto shoot him.   The three assailants seized the bag with the money\n\nand fled in a dark-colored Jeep Grand Cherokee.             A short time\n\nlater, the police discovered a burned-out Grand Cherokee in the\n\narea.\n\n           Around noon on March 6, 2002, another armored truck\n\nattempted to deliver $300,000 to the Valenciano Cooperative in\n\nJuncos, Puerto Rico.       The truck was driven by security officer\n\nEluber Torres-Alejandro (\"Torres\"), who was accompanied by his\n\npartner,   Gilberto    Rodríguez-Cabrera   (\"Rodríguez\").     As   Torres\n\nwalked toward the credit union, Lorenzo Catalán-Román (\"Catalán\")\n\napproached with a firearm to demand the money.              The robbery,\n\nhowever, failed.      Torres pulled out a firearm and Rodríguez opened\n\nthe truck door and aimed another gun at Catalán.       Catalán turned\n\nand fled. Torres observed that as Catalán ran away, a motorcyclist\n\nwho had lingered behind the truck and a blue Chevy Lumina with\n\ntinted windows both sped away.\n\n           On the morning of March 27, 2002, Torres and Rodríguez\n\nattempted to make another delivery, this time $100,000 to the Saulo\n\nde Rodríguez Credit Union in Gurabo, Puerto Rico.      However, before\n\nRodríguez reached the front door of the credit union, Medina and\n\nCatalán approached with pistols in their hands.      Rodríguez made no\n\nresistance and raised his hands, but Medina fired a shot from a\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fGlock 9mm pistol and Rodríguez fell back against the building\n\nwindow.\n\n          Hearing the gunfire, Torres opened the truck door and\n\nshot Catalán in the leg.    Torres's hand was then hit by a bullet\n\nfrom an unseen shooter.    Injured, he climbed back into the truck.\n\nAs Rodríguez begged for his life, Medina took the bag of money and\n\nfired another shot at him. Medina fled, leaving an injured Catalán\n\nbehind.   Catalán then picked up his pistol and fired six shots at\n\nRodríguez, who was lying prone on the ground and begging for mercy.\n\nRodríguez died as a result of gun shot wounds.\n\n          Soon thereafter, Sterling appeared from the drive-through\n\narea with a gun in his hand.       Sterling attempted to help the\n\ninjured Catalán, but fled when the police arrived.       One officer\n\narrested Catalán and another chased, but then lost, Sterling in the\n\nnearby wooded area.   A few hours later, a wet and dirty Sterling,\n\nwho was sitting on the side of the road near the credit union, was\n\narrested by the police.       After being advised of his rights,\n\nSterling confessed to participating in the robbery and throwing\n\naside his gun as he fled from the police.    He described how he had\n\nbeen picked up early that morning and had waited in the parking lot\n\nfor the armored truck to arrive.       He also confessed that he had\n\nparticipated in other robberies with the same group of people.\n\n          Nearby, the police recovered a stolen green Ford Explorer\n\nthat contained the Glock 9mm pistol used by Medina to shoot\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fRodríguez, as well as eleven shell casings and a bullet fragment.\n\nAt trial, the government's ballistics expert testified that the\n\ncasings, fragment, and the bullet from Torres's injured hand were\n\nall traced to a Taurus 9mm pistol that belonged to Morales.\n\n              B.   Morales\n\n              Between June 2000 and March 2002, Morales worked as a\n\ntruck driver and received minimum wage.           His gross weekly pay was\n\napproximately $200.          In 2001, he and his wife, Minerva Núñez-\n\nMorales, reported a total gross annual income of $11,342 on their\n\ntax forms.         In 2001, Morales became romantically involved with\n\nJocelyn Serrano-Castro (\"Serrano\").          According to Serrano, Morales\n\nwas   close    friends   with    Medina,    Catalán,   Sterling,   and   Pablo\n\nSánchez-Rodríguez (\"Sánchez\").\n\n              Despite his relatively modest income, Morales was able to\n\nbuy cars for both his wife and Serrano.           On or about December 10,\n\n2001, Morales purchased a 1993 blue Chevy Lumina for Serrano after\n\ntelling her that he had \"scored a big hit.\"            On December 18, 2001,\n\nMorales's wife inspected a 1996 green Chevy Lumina, called Morales\n\nto report that the car was in good condition, and then paid the\n\nseller $5,000 in cash.          And then in April 2002, he paid for more\n\nthan half the $7,200 price of a 1994 blue Grand Marquis.\n\n              The blue Chevy Lumina, however, was taken away from\n\nSerrano some time in February 2002, one month before the second\n\nrobbery. The pair had a fight and Morales allegedly struck Serrano\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fin the head with a Taurus 9mm pistol that he always carried with\n\nhim.    Morales later forced Serrano to transfer the car to Medina.\n\nAt trial, Serrano testified that although the car belonged to\n\nMedina, she had never seen him drive it.           Morales almost always\n\ndrove   the    car.   Medina   owned   other   means   of   transportation,\n\nincluding a motorcycle.\n\n              Serrano testified in great detail regarding the events of\n\nMarch 27, 2002, the day of the fatal armed robbery.             She related\n\nhow Morales came to pick her up around 9:00 a.m. in a blue Chevy\n\nLumina.       When she expressed some surprise at the early hour,\n\nMorales told her that the \"guys had scored a hit and he did not\n\ntrust the person that was going to pick them up.\"           He told her that\n\n\"the guys had called him so he would go pick them up.\"           They drove\n\nto Gurabo where Sánchez was waiting.       The two men parked their cars\n\nand talked for about 15-20 minutes in Sánchez's vehicle.                 As\n\nSerrano and Morales were driving back to Bayamón, he received a\n\ncall from Sánchez.      Morales then called his wife and switched cars\n\n-- the green Chevy Lumina for the blue Chevy Lumina.\n\n              A few hours later, Morales picked up Serrano and drove to\n\na Wendy's parking lot in Caguas.         Serrano testified that Morales\n\nmet with Sánchez and another individual, who gave Morales a duffel\n\nbag containing cash. Later that evening, Morales and Serrano drove\n\nback to the Gurabo area and stopped at a mile-marker on the edge of\n\nthe highway.      Morales stepped out of the car, reached behind the\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fmile-marker, and retrieved his Taurus 9mm pistol.          They then drove\n\nto a shopping mall and purchased two new cell phones.\n\n            The following day, March 28th, Morales and Serrano went\n\nto visit Medina.     Serrano observed that the apartment was full of\n\nnew furniture and Medina responded that \"they had scored a big hit\n\nand that they were buying everything new.\"            A couple of weeks\n\nlater, Morales paid for half the cost of a 1994 blue Grand Marquis.\n\n            On April 17, 2002, Morales and Serrano were driving in\n\nthe Grand Marquis when they were stopped by the police for driving\n\nwith    tinted   windows.   Morales   hid   the   Taurus   9mm   pistol   in\n\nSerrano's purse, but the police discovered the loaded gun and\n\narrested both Morales and Serrano.          Morales told the arresting\n\nofficer that the gun belonged to him.\n\n            C.   Jury Trial and Sentencing\n\n            Morales, Sterling, and three co-defendants were charged\n\nin a ten-count indictment.    Morales and Sterling were both charged\n\nwith:    Count One, conspiring to obstruct commerce by robbery, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a);1 Count Two, aiding and abetting\n\n\n\n1\n    18 U.S.C. § 1951(a) reads:\n\n       Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or\n       affects commerce or the movement of any article or\n       commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or\n       attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens\n       physical violence to any person or property in\n       furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in\n       violation of this section shall be fined under this title\n       or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fin    the   knowing   possession,   use,    or   carrying   of   firearms   in\n\nfurtherance or during and in relation to the conspiracy alleged in\n\nCount One, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(iii)2 and 2;3\n\nCount Seven, aiding and abetting in the March 27, 2002 robbery of\n\napproximately $100,000, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951(a) and 2;\n\nCount    Eight,   aiding   and   abetting   in   the   knowing    possession,\n\nbrandishing, use, or carrying of firearms during and in relation to\n\nthe    robbery,   which    unlawfully   killed     Rodríguez     with   malice\n\naforethought, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(j)4 and 2; Count\n\n\n2\n     18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) reads:\n\n       [A]ny person who, during and in relation to any crime of\n       violence or drug trafficking crime . . . , uses or\n       carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such\n       crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the\n       punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug\n       trafficking crime, if the firearm is discharged, be\n       sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10\n       years.\n3\n     18 U.S.C. § 2 reads:\n\n       (a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States\n       or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures\n       its commission, is punishable as a principal. (b) Whoever\n       willfully causes an act to be done which if directly\n       performed by him or another would be an offense against\n       the United States, is punishable as a principal.\n4\n     18 U.S.C. § 924(j) reads:\n\n       A person who, in the course of a violation of subsection\n       (c), causes the death of a person through the use of a\n       firearm, shall: (1) if the killing is a murder (as\n       defined in section 1111), be punished by death or by\n       imprisonment for any term of years or for life; and (2)\n       if the killing is manslaughter (as defined in section\n       1112), be punished as provided in that section.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fNine, aiding and abetting in the knowing possession, brandishing,\n\nuse,   or   carrying   of   firearms    during   and   in   relation   to   the\n\nMarch 27, 2002 robbery alleged in Count Seven, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) and 2.           Additionally, Sterling was\n\ncharged with: Count Three, aiding and abetting in the November 30,\n\n2001 robbery of more than $100,000, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n1951(a) and 2, and Count Four, aiding and abetting in knowing\n\npossession, use or carrying of firearms in furtherance or during\n\nand in relation to the November 30, 2001 robbery, in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) and 2.            Morales additionally was\n\ncharged in Count Ten with being a felon in possession of a firearm,\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2).5\n\n            Morales and Sterling pleaded not guilty and the two went\n\nto trial on August 29, 2005.            The government's first witness,\n\nTorres, testified about both the March 27, 2002 robbery and the\n\nMarch 6, 2002 attempted robbery. Counsel objected to the testimony\n\nregarding the attempted robbery.         The district court overruled the\n\nobjection and allowed the testimony.\n\n            After the presentation of the government's case-in-chief,\n\ndefense counsel filed for judgments of acquittal on nearly all\n\ncounts.6    After limited oral argument, the court denied the Rule 29\n\n\n\n5\n  Morales had a prior 1996 attempted murder felony conviction from\nPuerto Rico that had resulted in a two-year term of incarceration.\n6\n    Morales's counsel stated that he would not contest Count Ten.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fmotions.      Morales presented an expert witness, a firearms and\n\nballistics consultant, who testified that in his opinion, the\n\nvarious    rounds      and   casings    submitted   into    evidence   by    the\n\ngovernment were not fired by the Taurus pistol.                The defendants\n\nrested and failed to renew their Rule 29 motions.             On September 9,\n\n2005,   the    jury    returned   a    verdict,   finding   both   Morales   and\n\nSterling guilty on all counts.          There was no renewal of the Rule 29\n\nmotions following the verdict.\n\n              On December 12, 2005, Sterling was sentenced to: twenty-\n\nyear terms as to each of Counts One, Three, and Seven, to be served\n\nconcurrently; thirty-year terms as to each of Counts Two and Nine,\n\nto be served concurrently to each other and to the sentence in\n\nCount Four, but consecutively to the other counts; a twenty-one\n\nyear term as to Count Four; and a life term of imprisonment as to\n\nCount Eight.          On January 11, 2006, Morales was sentenced to:\n\ntwenty-year terms each as to Counts One and Seven and a ten-year\n\nminimum as to Count Ten, to be served concurrently with one\n\nanother; thirty-year terms each as to Counts Two and Nine, to be\n\nserved concurrently with each other, but consecutively to the other\n\ncounts; and a life term of imprisonment as to Count Eight.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f                              II.    Discussion\n\n           A.    Morales's Rule 29 Challenge\n\n           On appeal, Morales challenges the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence underlying the jury's guilty verdict on Counts One, Two,\n\nSeven, Eight, and Nine.

In this case, the President of Ranger American Armored\nSecurities Services testified that the losses resulting from the\nrobberies affected his ability to make purchases in the United\nStates to operate his business.       Accordingly, the robberies\nresulted in a sufficient impact on commerce.\n\n                                       -13-\n\f            First, the jury heard testimony that Morales earned a\n\nminimum wage salary, yet was able to purchase several thousand\n\ndollars worth of cars for his wife and girlfriend.               In December\n\n2001, he purchased a green 1996 Chevy Lumina for his wife.                 In\n\nDecember 2001, he also purchased a blue 1993 Chevy Lumina for\n\nSerrano.    And then in April 2002, he was involved in the purchase\n\nof a blue 1994 Grand Marquis.8         Morales paid for these purchases in\n\ncash.      With   respect   to   the   March   27,   2002   robbery,   Serrano\n\ntestified that Morales picked up a duffel bag containing a sum of\n\ncash after a meeting in a Wendy's parking lot.                The government\n\nargues that, in addition to this suspicious influx of cash, the\n\ntiming of these car purchases coincided with the commission of the\n\ntwo robberies:     November 2001 and March 2002.\n\n            Second, Serrano testified that on March 27, 2002, Morales\n\ntold her that \"the guys had scored a hit and . . . the guys had\n\ncalled him so that he would go pick them up.\"          That day, they drove\n\nalong the road to Gurabo and Morales retrieved his Taurus 9mm\n\npistol from behind a specific highway mile-marker. With respect to\n\nthe pistol, the jury heard from the government's firearm expert who\n\ntestified that the gun was used to fire the eleven casings found on\n\nthe floor of the Ford Explorer found abandoned near the scene of\n\n\n\n8\n  The government's witness, an automobile dealer at Yamilisy Auto\nSales, testified that a woman, Marisol Ríos Matías, and a man\npurchased the blue 1994 Grand Marquis for $7,200. The purchase was\nentirely in cash, with more than half provided by Morales.\n\n                                       -14-\n\fthe March 27 robbery.     Ballistics reports also linked the gun to\n\nthe bullet that had struck Torres's hand during the robbery shoot-\n\nout.\n\n          Based on this evidence, a reasonable jury could have\n\nconcluded that Morales participated in the conspiracy to obstruct\n\ninterstate commerce through robbery (Count One), and aided and\n\nabetted the commission of the March 27, 2002 robbery (Count Seven).\n\nWhile a large portion of the evidence submitted to the jury\n\nregarding Morales's role in the offense is based primarily on\n\nSerrano's testimony, the jury reasonably credited her account of\n\nthe events.   It is not for us to make credibility determinations in\n\nthe course of a review of the sufficiency of the evidence.       Our\n\ntask is only to determine whether a rational jury could have\n\nbelieved the testimony.    See United States v.

Carrying or Use of Firearm During Crime of\n                   Violence\n\n          Under the firearms statute relating to Counts Two and\n\nNine, the government had to shoulder the burden of proving that\n\nMorales aided and abetted in the use or carrying of a firearm\n\n\"during and in relation to any crime of violence.\"   18 U.S.C. § 924\n\n(c)(1)(A).    A violation of the Hobbs Act is a crime of violence for\n\npurposes of this statutory provision.

After being duly informed of\n\nhis rights, Morales told the police that the gun belonged to him.\n\nAt trial, Serrano testified that Morales almost always carried the\n\nTaurus 9mm gun with him.        She also testified that on March 27,\n\nMorales retrieved the gun from behind a mile-marker on the highway\n\nto Gurabo.     Additionally, the government presented ballistics\n\nevidence linking the Taurus 9mm gun to both the casings and the\n\nbullet fired into Torres's hand during the March 27, 2002 robbery.\n\nWhile the government proffered no direct evidence that Morales had\n\nknowingly supplied or given the gun to those physically involved in\n\nthe robbery that morning, a jury could make such an inference on\n\nthe basis of the testimony regarding the post-robbery events.            In\n\nany event, we review this sufficiency claim only for clear and\n\ngross injustice as a result of Morales's failure to renew his Rule\n\n29 motion.    Morales's scarcely developed argument falls short of\n\nthat required showing.\n\n                    3. Aiding and Abetting in the Use of a Firearm\n                    During a Violent Crime, Which Unlawfully Killed\n                    Rodríguez\n\n            In order to sustain a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(j)(1),\n\nthe government had to demonstrate that Morales aided and abetted\n\nthe use of a firearm in committing a crime of violence, and in the\n\ncourse of that violation caused the murder of Rodríguez through the\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fuse of the firearm.      A violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a) is a crime\n\nof violence.    See, e.g., United States v. Jiménez-Torres, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202004\"><a href=\"/opinion/202004/united-states-v-jimenez-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10 (1st Cir. 2006).     For the purposes of this violation, murder\n\nis defined as the \"unlawful killing of a human being with malice\n\naforethought.\"     18 U.S.C. § 1111.        That provision goes on to\n\nenumerate a list of murders categorized as murder in the first\n\ndegree, including \"murder . . . committed in the perpetration of\n\n. . . robbery.\"    Id.\n\n             In his appeal, Morales contends that the government\n\nfailed to establish the malice element of the offense.       He argues\n\nthat the evidence in the record establishes only that there was a\n\n\"robbery, that things got out of hand, a shooting ensued and a\n\ndeath resulted.\"    Morales's argument is unavailing under our case\n\nlaw.   In United States v. Shea, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768605\"><a href=\"/opinion/768605/united-states-v-anthony-m-shea-united-states-of-america-v-michael-k/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2000), we\n\nconcluded that 18 U.S.C. § 1111 \"was intended to adopt the felony\n\nmurder rule, and for a stated felony the 'malice' element is\n\nsatisfied by the intent to commit the unlawful felony.\"      Id. at 674\n\n(citing cases).\n\n             The government presented evidence at trial that Morales\n\naided and abetted in a conspiracy to commit and the commission of\n\nthe March 27, 2002 armed robbery.        That morning, Medina, Catalán,\n\nand Sterling waited for the armored truck with the intent to commit\n\na robbery.    The group was armed with pistols and, in the course of\n\nthe robbery, Medina and Catalán shot and killed Rodríguez.       Under\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\f18 U.S.C. § 1111, the killing of Rodríguez was \"first-degree murder\n\nby those who perpetrated the robbery, regardless of who pulled the\n\ntrigger or any individual intent.\"               Id.     Having concluded that a\n\nreasonably jury could find that Morales aided and abetted in the\n\ncommission of the robbery and in the use of the firearm, it follows\n\nthat his conviction for murder is reasonable as well.\n\n             Based   on     the    record    evidence,        we   conclude      that   a\n\nreasonable jury could have found Morales guilty beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt of all of the charged offenses.                He therefore fails to make\n\nthe   more    difficult      showing       of    clear    and      gross    injustice.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of his Rule 29\n\nmotion.\n\n             B.   Morales's Evidentiary Challenge\n\n             Morales also argues that the district court erred in\n\nadmitting Torres's testimony regarding the March 6, 2002 attempted\n\nrobbery.     He contends that the testimony was unfairly prejudicial\n\nand   outweighed     its    probative       value.

Torres\n\ntestified that his would-be assailant -- later identified as\n\nLorenzo Catalán, who was involved in the March 27, 2002 robbery --\n\napproached him as he was making his way to the front door of the\n\ncredit union.   He and his partner Rodríguez drew their weapons and\n\nCatalán fled.     Torres testified that immediately thereafter, a\n\nsuspicious man on a motorcycle who had been lingering behind the\n\ntruck sped away and a blue Chevy Lumina with tinted windows also\n\nsped out of the parking lot.\n\n            At trial, the government asserted that the two charged\n\nrobberies -- on November 30 and March 27 -- were part of a\n\nconspiracy to obstruct commerce through robbery.           The government\n\npresented   evidence   that    the   robberies   evinced   the   following\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fsimilarities: early morning deliveries to Gurabo-area credit unions\n\nby Ranger American Armored Securities Services trucks; one or two\n\narmed assailants, with unseen others providing cover; and the\n\nparticipation of the same individuals.

In\n\nfurther support of its case, the government offered the testimony\n\nof Torres who testified to the events of March 6, 2002, that\n\nexhibited the same modus operandi.

Morales's Sentencing Challenge\n\n          Morales   appeals   the    district   court's   denial   of   his\n\nrequest for a downward adjustment for a minor role.         Prior to his\n\nsentencing hearing, he objected to the Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\"),\n\narguing that he was entitled to a minor role adjustment under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.2(b).    The government disagreed and argued that\n\nMorales could not be characterized as the least culpable in view of\n\nhis role supplying the gun and sharing in the proceeds.                 The\n\ndistrict court denied the request for minor-role adjustment.\n\n          Unless there is a mistake of law, we review a district\n\ncourt's denial of downward adjustment for clear error.

Given the fact-\n\n\n\n9\n   Moreover, even if the district court had erred in admitting the\ntestimony, we would conclude that such error was harmless. The\ntestimony about the March 6th attempted robbery was brief and\ncumulative. Morales's guilt in this case turned, in significant\npart, on the credibility of Serrano's testimony and the testimony\nlinking Morales's Taurus 9mm gun to the March 27, 2002 shooting.\n\n                                    -21-\n\fspecific    nature   of   a    defendant's   status   determination,    great\n\ndeference    is   given   to   the   district   court:   \"[B]attles    over   a\n\ndefendant's status . . . will almost always be won or lost in the\n\ndistrict court.\"      United States v.

The district court denied the request.              The\n\ncourt determined that Morales's role in the offense was more\n\nsignificant than that of a mere minor participant, indeed the court\n\nfound him to be \"intimately involved.\"             Morales was in telephonic\n\ncontact with the other defendants who were physically participating\n\nin the robbery; was supposed to pick-up the defendants after the\n\nMarch 27, 2002 robbery; supplied the Taurus 9mm pistol that shot\n\nTorres in the hand during the shoot-out; and enjoyed a share of the\n\nstolen money.      Based on the record, the district court reasonably\n\nconcluded that Morales's role \"outstripped the . . . 'minor' rungs\n\non the hierarchical ladder of blameworthiness.\"               García, 954 F.2d\n\nat 18.   We thus find no error in the district court's denial of the\n\ndownward role-in-the-offense adjustment.\n\n           D.     Sterling's Sentencing Challenge\n\n           On September 9, 2005, the jury found Sterling guilty on\n\nall charged counts.           At his sentencing hearing on November 17,\n\n2006, he was sentenced to: twenty-year terms as to Counts One,\n\nThree, and Seven, to be served concurrently; thirty-year terms as\n\nto Counts Two and Nine, to be served concurrently to each other and\n\nthe sentence in Count Four, but consecutively to the others counts;\n\n\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fa    twenty-one    year    term    as    to     Count   Four;   and   a   life    term\n\nimprisonment as to Count Eight.10\n\n            Our review of a district court's sentence is a two-step\n\nprocess,    with    both    a     substantive        and   procedural     component.\n\nSee United States v.

With\n\nrespect to our procedural inquiry, we look to whether the district\n\ncourt    properly    calculated         the    Guidelines    range,     treated   the\n\nGuidelines as advisory, considered the various 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)\n\nfactors, and adequately explained the chosen sentence.                      See id.\n\n(citing Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 597).               In this case, the district court\n\nmade the appropriate Guidelines calculations for all counts and\n\nconsidered the proper statutory factors.\n\n            Having found no procedural error, we next turn to the\n\nsubstantive   reasonableness            of    the   defendant's   sentence.        See\n\nPolitano, 522 F.3d at 72.            We review under a highly deferential\n\nabuse of discretion standard.                 See id. (citations omitted); see\n\nalso Martin, 520 F.3d at 96 (\"[T]he linchpin of a reasonableness\n\n\n\n\n10\n   Sterling was first sentenced on December 12, 2005. Three months\nafter his sentencing hearing, he filed a motion requesting\nresentencing because he had not fully understood his right of\nallocution.    The court held a second sentencing hearing on\nNovember 17, 2006.    After being duly informed of his right of\nallocution, Sterling declined to exercise it.       The court then\nimposed the same sentence.\n\n                                             -24-\n\fsentence is a plausible sentencing rationale and a defensible\n\noverall result.\").\n\n           Sterling's challenge to the substantive reasonableness of\n\nhis life sentence faces an uphill battle.              A sentence within the\n\napplicable Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.              See Rita\n\nv. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145708\"><a href=\"/opinion/145708/rita-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2456</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2463 (2007) (\"[T]he presumption\n\nreflects the fact that, by the time an appeals court is considering\n\na within-Guidelines sentence on review, both the sentencing judge\n\nand the Sentencing Commission will have reached the same conclusion\n\nas to the proper sentence in the particular case.\") (emphasis in\n\noriginal).     Here, Sterling's sentence of life imprisonment was\n\nbased on his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(j). Under the\n\nGuidelines, a § 924(j) offense (assuming the application, as in\n\nthis case, of U.S.S.G. § 2A1.1) has a base offense level of forty-\n\nthree, which corresponds to a recommended sentence of a life term\n\nof imprisonment.\n\n           Sterling first argues that the sentence was unreasonable\n\nbecause he was not the one to shoot Rodríguez.                This argument is\n\nmeritless.     While Sterling was not the actual shooter, the jury\n\nfound   that   he   had   aided   and   abetted   in    two    separate   armed\n\nrobberies: in the first, Sterling was one of two assailants who\n\nthreatened to shoot the security officer; and in the second, the\n\nevidence (indeed his own confession) linked him to the robbery that\n\nresulted in Rodríguez's death. Indeed, with respect to his role in\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fthe robbery, the PSR stated that Sterling was \"providing cover for\n\nthe other assailants while they shot Mr. Rodríguez.\"\n\n           Second, he argues that the district court should have\n\nafforded greater weight to his personal background and lack of\n\ncriminal history.     He argues that the court failed to consider\n\nwhether a life sentence was appropriate for a twenty-seven year old\n\ndefendant with a tenth grade education and no prior criminal\n\nhistory.   Looking to the terms of incarceration imposed for all of\n\nthe other charges, he posits that the fifty years he received was\n\nmore than sufficient to administer just punishment, reflect the\n\nseriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, afford\n\nadequate   deterrence,   and   protect   the   public.     See   18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(a).   He argues that the imposition of a life sentence for\n\nCount Eight was unnecessary.\n\n           While we might have imposed a lesser sentence in this\n\ncase if we were sitting as the sentencing court, that is not a\n\nbasis for reversal.      We afford broad discretion to the district\n\ncourt in affixing the appropriate sentence and we recognize that\n\n\"there is not a single reasonable sentence but, rather, a range of\n\nreasonable sentences.\"    Martin, 520 F.3d at 92.        This is a case in\n\nwhich the district judge who had presided over trial was intimately\n\nfamiliar with the facts and the particular acts attributed to the\n\ndefendant.   After hearing argument from counsel on the § 3553(a)\n\nfactors, the district court stated that it had considered them all\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\fand announced its sentence.          While the court's explanation was by\n\nno means lengthy, we have held that a sentencing court is \"not\n\nrequired to address those factors, one by one, in some sort of rote\n\nincantation when explicating its sentencing decision.\"                United\n\nStates v.
