Kesten, with whom Deidre Brennan Regan and Brody,\nHardoon, Perkins & Kesten were on brief, for appellants Peter\nMcClelland and Robert Chapman.\n     Donald W. Cook, with whom Kathleen J. Wood was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                             May 6, 2003\n\f               Per Curiam.             On December 16, 1994, Jerome Jarrett fled\n\nthe    scene     of    a       minor    traffic   accident     and    was    subsequently\n\napprehended by Shadow, a police dog controlled by Yarmouth Police\n\nOfficer Peter McClelland. Shadow bit Jarrett at least twice on the\n\nleg in the course of corralling him before officers arrived to take\n\nthe suspect into custody.                  Jarrett filed 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 claims\n\nagainst Officer McClelland and Robert Chapman, the Yarmouth Chief\n\nof    Police,1    alleging         that    McClelland       used    excessive    force   in\n\nreleasing Shadow, and that Chief Chapman \"tolerated a pattern and\n\npractice of unjustified, unreasonable and excessive force regarding\n\nMcClelland's use of a dog to attack and bite.\"                               Jarrett also\n\nbrought suit against the Town of Yarmouth, seeking to hold the\n\nmunicipality liable under a Monell theory, see Monell v. New York\n\nDep't of Soc. Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978), for promulgating a dog\n\napprehension policy that deprived him of his constitutional rights.\n\n               After       a    bifurcated    trial,    a    jury    returned    verdicts\n\nagainst both Officer McClelland and Chief Chapman.2                         The defendants\n\n\n       1\n      Jarrett also brought claims against Yarmouth police officers\nGerard Britt, Cheryl Nugent Gomsey, and Richard White, but did not\npursue these claims at trial.\n       2\n      The jury was not explicitly invited to issue a verdict with\nrespect to the Town in either phase of the trial; indeed, neither\nthe jury instructions nor the verdict forms expressly referenced\nthe Town as a party. These omissions have created some dispute as\nto whether Jarrett properly preserved his municipal liability claim\nbelow. Close scrutiny of the record reveals that Jarrett's counsel\ndid preserve the Monell claim, anticipating that if jury verdicts\nagainst Chapman and/or McClelland were later reversed on grounds of\n\n                                              -2-\n\fnow contest the verdicts on appeal, arguing that the court erred in\n\ndenying their request for qualified immunity, and raising a host of\n\nevidentiary challenges. After careful review, we find that Jarrett\n\nsuffered no constitutional injury.         Accordingly, we vacate the\n\njudgments against McClelland, Chapman, and the Town of Yarmouth.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          In the early morning hours of December 16, 1994, Yarmouth\n\nPolice Officer Gerard Britt observed the defendant sitting in his\n\ncar in a motel parking lot off of Route 28.     Officer Britt then saw\n\nJarrett quickly exit the motel parking lot and drive off in the\n\nopposite direction on Route 28.        Britt radioed to fellow officer\n\nRichard White, and the two officers unobtrusively tracked Jarrett,\n\nwho was driving in excess of sixty miles per hour.     Several minutes\n\nlater, Jarrett exited into another parking lot off of Route 28.\n\nOfficer White followed Jarrett off the exit while Officer Britt\n\ncontinued up the road and entered the parking lot from the opposite\n\nend. The parties dispute what happened next. The appellants claim\n\nthat Officer Britt, now driving toward Jarrett, activated his\n\nlights and signaled for Jarrett to stop.        Yet Jarrett continued\n\ndriving directly toward Britt, who swerved abruptly and narrowly\n\navoided a collision.   Jarrett insists that Britt never activated\n\n\nqualified   immunity   notwithstanding    the   commission   of   a\nconstitutional violation, Jarrett could still claim attorney's fees\nfrom the Town if it was implicated in the violation. However, for\nthe reasons that follow, we find that Jarrett's municipal liability\nclaim fails as a matter of law.\n\n                               -3-\n\fhis lights and that there was no near-collision.              Both parties\n\nagree, however, that Jarrett proceeded to drive into an adjoining\n\nparking lot, where he ran into a cement post.         Jarrett then exited\n\nthe vehicle, scaled a nearby fence, and fled into a residential\n\nneighborhood.\n\n           At this point, two additional Yarmouth police officers\n\njoined the chase. Officer Cheryl Nugent Gomsey had clocked Jarrett\n\ndriving over the speed limit while being followed by Officers White\n\nand Britt on Route 28, and also observed him hit the cement post\n\nand escape over the fence. Officer McClelland, the K-9 officer for\n\nthe Yarmouth Police, was also radioed to the scene by Officer\n\nWhite,   who    reported   (mistakenly,   as   it   turned   out)   that   he\n\nrecognized Jarrett as a suspect in a prior armed robbery.           Officer\n\nGomsey arrived at the scene shortly after Jarrett fled from the\n\nparking lot, and teamed with Officer McClelland and his dog Shadow\n\nto track and apprehend Jarrett.\n\n               After helping Shadow over the fence, Officer McClelland\n\nplaced him on his customary 15-foot lead and followed closely\n\nbehind as the dog tracked Jarrett.        Officer Gomsey continued the\n\npursuit at some distance behind McClelland and Shadow so as not to\n\ncontaminate the scent. For approximately twenty minutes Shadow led\n\nthe officers along a circuitous route through the residential\n\nneighborhood until McClelland spotted Jarrett standing in the\n\nmiddle of the road, approximately fifty yards away. Officer Gomsey\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fhad fallen too far behind to see McClelland, Shadow, or Jarrett,\n\nbut she heard McClelland yell three times: \"Stop, police, or I'll\n\nsend the dog.\"      McClelland testified that after he issued these\n\nwarnings, Jarrett accelerated and disappeared around a corner.\n\nOnly then, according to McClelland, did he release Shadow with\n\ninstructions to locate Jarrett and hold him.\n\n           Shadow    is     trained      to     execute   the    \"bite-and-hold\"\n\ntechnique upon release, meaning that he will bite and maintain his\n\nhold upon a suspect until the handler orders him to let go.\n\nAccordingly, a suspect who struggles with a dog trained to bite and\n\nhold may be bitten several times if the dog loses his grip and is\n\nforced to re-establish his hold.               Yet the undisputed evidence at\n\ntrial indicated that the vast majority of jurisdictions within the\n\nUnited   States    employ    bite-and-hold        policies.      An     alternative\n\ntechnique, not widely adopted, is the \"circle and bark\" method.                    A\n\ndog trained to circle and bark will circle his target, barking,\n\nuntil his handler arrives.          The dog will bite only if the target\n\nthen attempts to move outside the \"circle\".\n\n           Because Shadow was trained to bite and hold, Officer\n\nMcClelland   knew    with    a    high    probability     that    if    Shadow    was\n\nreleased, he would bite the fleeing suspect.                     In fact, within\n\nthirty seconds of his release, Shadow apprehended Jarrett by biting\n\nhim on the leg.      Shadow was only out of McClelland's sight for\n\nthose thirty      seconds;   as    soon    as    McClelland     found    Shadow    he\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fcommanded    him    to    release   Jarrett,    and    Shadow     complied.         An\n\nambulance arrived within five minutes and transported Jarrett to a\n\nhospital, where he received stitches for cuts on his lower right\n\nleg.      For the next two weeks Jarrett received daily medical\n\ntreatment for his injuries; one year after the incident he still\n\ncomplained of pain and an inability to stand.\n\n            Not surprisingly, Jarrett recounts a different version of\n\nevents.     At trial, he testified that after finishing his shift at\n\nwork, he picked up a car that he had recently purchased.                            He\n\nclaimed not to have noticed the police officers trailing him on\n\nRoute 28, and further testified that he pulled off the road into\n\nthe parking lot because he was experiencing brake problems and\n\ntrying to find a place to slow down.                  Jarrett admitted seeing\n\npolice lights shortly before hitting the cement post, but insisted\n\nthat   he   never   saw    a   police   cruiser      heading    toward   his   car.\n\nAccording to Jarrett, he fled after hitting the cement post because\n\n\"I was driving illegally for one.             And I knew that . . . if I got\n\narrested, I was going to end up going to jail.\"                Indeed, the record\n\nindicates that prior to the events in question, a warrant for\n\nJarrett's    arrest      was   issued   after   he    failed    to   appear    at    a\n\nsurrender hearing on a separate matter.                 However, both parties\n\nagree that the police officers pursuing Jarrett on December 16 were\n\nnot aware of this outstanding arrest warrant.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f           After   jumping        the   fence,   Jarrett   testified   that   he\n\nslipped and fell down, at which point he heard someone yell \"Stop.\"\n\nHe rose to his feet, and again heard someone yell, \"Stop, or I'll\n\nlet the dog go.\"       Jarrett claims that he stopped running and put\n\nhis hands in the air.        Soon thereafter, however, Shadow jumped on\n\nhis back and bit him twice on the leg in response to verbal\n\ncommands issued from someone Jarrett could not see.                 Jarrett was\n\nultimately     apprehended    by    officers     McClelland   and   Gomsey    and\n\ncharged with several misdemeanor offenses: (1) operating a motor\n\nvehicle with a suspended license; (2) leaving the scene of an\n\naccident; (3) operating an uninsured motor vehicle; and (4) failing\n\nto stop for a police officer.             He was also charged with several\n\ncivil infractions: (1) operating an unregistered motor vehicle; (2)\n\nfailing   to   yield   at    an    intersection;    (3)    speeding;   and    (4)\n\noperating a motor vehicle with defective equipment.\n\n                                        II.\n\n             On December 11, 1997, Jarrett filed section 1983 claims\n\nagainst the Town of Yarmouth and five Yarmouth police officers in\n\nthe District Court of Massachusetts.             Jarrett's complaint alleged\n\ninter alia that Officer McClelland's act of releasing Shadow\n\nconstituted excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment,\n\ncharacterizing Shadow as an \"instrument of potentially deadly\n\nforce.\"   Jarrett sought compensatory and punitive damages from\n\nMcClelland for his alleged use of excessive force, and punitive\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fdamages from Chief Chapman for tolerating a pattern and practice of\n\nexcessive force by Officer McClelland.\n\n           The case proceeded to a jury trial, which the court\n\ndivided into two phases.         In the first phase of the trial, the\n\njurors considered Jarrett's excessive force claim against Officer\n\nMcClelland.       They ultimately returned a verdict for Jarrett,\n\nfinding by a preponderance of the evidence that \"Officer Peter\n\nMcClelland used excessive force on Jerome Jarrett on 12/16/94.\"\n\nHowever, the jury only awarded Jarrett one dollar in compensatory\n\ndamages and no punitive damages.           Although, as noted above, the\n\nTown of Yarmouth was not mentioned in either the jury instructions\n\nor on the verdict form, the jury, unprompted, appended to their\n\nverdict a recommendation that \"the Town of Yarmouth be required\n\nfrom this time forward to . . . . retrain current K-9 units to use\n\nthe find and bark method.\"3       Following the verdict, McClelland and\n\nChapman moved for judgment as a matter of law, renewing the\n\nargument that they were entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n           The judge denied the motion, and the trial moved into its\n\nsecond   phase,    where   the   jury    considered   Jarrett's   claim   for\n\npunitive   damages    against    Chief    Chapman.     After   hearing    the\n\nevidence, the jury completed the verdict form for Phase II.                In\n\nresponse to the first question -- \"Did defendant Peter McClelland\n\n\n     3\n      Jarrett does not argue on appeal that the jury's\n\"recommendation\" alone imposes liability on the Town or has any\nother binding effect.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fact in accordance with the Town of Yarmouth (sic) policy and\n\nprocedure when he released the dog on December 16, 1994?\" -- the\n\njury answered \"Yes.\"    As noted, the jury had earlier concluded in\n\nPhase   I   that   Officer   McClelland   used   excessive   force   in\n\napprehending Jarrett on the night in question.      See supra.   These\n\ntwo findings, coupled with the jury's admonition that the Town\n\nshould retrain its dogs to use the find and bark method, suggest\n\nthat the jury found the Town of Yarmouth's bite-and-hold policy to\n\nbe unconstitutional.   The jury ultimately awarded Jarrett punitive\n\ndamages in the amount of \"all reasonable legal fees and expenses\n\nincurred by the plaintiff's attorney.\"     The defense objected, and\n\nthe court ordered the jury to attach a specific dollar amount to\n\ntheir verdict. After further deliberation, the jury came back with\n\na figure of $50,000, and the trial court entered judgment for\n\nJarrett in the amount of $1.00 for Phase I, and $50,000 for Phase\n\nII.\n\n            McClelland and Chapman subsequently filed post-trial\n\nmotions for judgments as a matter of law, and, in the alternative,\n\nsought new trials under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b). The\n\nmotions articulated two grounds for relief:       1) the two officers\n\nwere entitled to qualified immunity, and 2) the evidence did not\n\nsupport the verdict in either phase of the trial.        The district\n\ncourt denied these motions, and the defendants appealed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f                                          III.\n\nA.   Jurisdiction\n\n               As a threshold matter, Jarrett argues that we lack\n\njurisdiction to hear this appeal because the trial court failed to\n\nenter a final appealable judgment or order.                         Specifically, he\n\npoints    to    the    district    court's       failure       to   make       any   formal\n\ndisposition of his claims against Officer Gomsey, Officer Britt,\n\nOfficer   White,      and    the   Town    of    Yarmouth.          According        to   the\n\nappellant: \"in a multi-defendant case such as this one where an\n\nappeal is taken from an order or judgment disposing of claims\n\nagainst less than all defendants, the appeal is premature and must\n\nbe dismissed.\"\n\n               Our jurisdiction is limited to \"all final decisions of\n\nthe district courts of the United States.\"                          United States v.\n\nLeichter, 160 F.3d 33, 35 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting 28 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1291) (emphasis added).            We have previously observed that \"[a]\n\n'final decision' is ordinarily one which disposes of all the rights\n\nof all the parties to an action.\"               In re Licht & Semonoff, 796 F.2d\n\n564, 569 (1st Cir. 1986).              On numerous occasions, however, the\n\nSupreme   Court       has   stressed      that    ยง   1291     should   be      construed\n\npractically rather than technically.                  See Firestone Tire & Rubber\n\nCo. v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 375 (1981) (referring to \"a tradition\n\nof   giving      ยง    1291    a    practical          rather    than       a    technical\n\nconstruction\"); Cox Broad. Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469, 486 (1975).\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fApplying this pragmatic approach, at least two circuits have\n\nconcluded that a federal district court decision is appealable\n\nunder section 1291 even if it does not formally dispose of claims\n\nthat were abandoned at trial.    See Vaughan v. Mobil Oil, 891 F.2d\n\n1195, 1198 (5th Cir. 1990); American Nat. Bank & Trust Co. of\n\nChicago v. Bailey, 750 F.2d 577, 580-81 (7th Cir. 1984), cert.\n\ndenied, 471 U.S. 1100 (1985).         The Fifth Circuit remarked in\n\nVaughan that it was \"inclined to fasten finality upon a judgment\n\nthat reflects the intention of the judge to dispose of all the\n\nbusiness before him or her.\"    891 F.2d at 1197.   Hence, \"[a]n order\n\nthat effectively ends the litigation on the merits is an appealable\n\nfinal judgment even if the district court does not formally include\n\njudgment on a claim that has been abandoned.\"            Id. at 1198\n\n(citations omitted).      Here, Jarrett does not contest that his\n\nclaims against Gomsey, Britt, and White were abandoned below.\n\nAccordingly, the district court's failure to enter judgment for the\n\nthree officers is a technical defect that does not undermine our\n\nappellate jurisdiction.    Firestone Tire, 449 U.S. at 373.\n\n          Jarrett also claims, however, that the court failed to\n\nenter a verdict on Jarrett's municipal liability claim against the\n\nTown of Yarmouth.      We disagree.     The district court properly\n\nentered judgment against Officer McClelland and Chief Chapman, both\n\nof whom were sued in their individual and official capacities.\n\nJarrett himself argues that \"[w]hen an individual is sued in his\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fofficial capacity, the lawsuit is in reality a claim against the\n\nentity.\"     See Brandon v. Holt, 469 U.S. 464, 471-72 (1985);\n\nNereida-Gonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d 701, 705 (1st Cir.\n\n1993) (\"An official capacity suit is, in reality, a suit against\n\nthe governmental entity, not against the governmental actor.\"). As\n\na general rule, therefore, a court entering judgment against\n\nmunicipal   officers   in   their   official   capacities   is   entering\n\njudgment against the municipality as well. Superficially, however,\n\nthe facts of this case present an additional complication.         While\n\nJarrett sued the officers in both their individual and official\n\ncapacities, the jury's award of punitive damages in Phase II\n\nappears to resolve only Jarrett's claim against Chief Chapman in\n\nhis individual capacity.    See Biggs v. Meadows, 66 F.3d 56, 61 (4th\n\nCir. 1995) (\"[An] indication that a suit has been brought against\n\na state actor personally may be a request for . . . punitive\n\ndamages, since such relief is unavailable in official capacity\n\nsuits.\").\n\n            Upon closer examination, the jury's award of punitive\n\ndamages on the Phase II verdict form does not undermine the\n\nfinality of the district court's decision with respect to the Town.\n\nThe proceedings below clearly reflect Jarrett's intent to resolve\n\nthe Monell municipal liability issue by soliciting the jury's\n\nresponse to question one on the Phase II verdict form: \"Did Peter\n\nMcClelland act in accordance with the Town of Yarmouth policy and\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fprocedure when he released the dog on December 16, 1994?\"                   The\n\nsecond question on the Phase II verdict form -- \"Has the plaintiff\n\nproved by a preponderance of the evidence that Chief Chapman\n\npermitted and tolerated a pattern and practice of unjustified,\n\nunreasonable and excessive force by Officer McClelland with respect\n\nto the latter's deployment of Shadow?\" -- was then intended to\n\nresolve Chapman's liability in his individual capacity for faulty\n\nsupervision, and the punitive damages awarded related only to\n\nChapman in his individual capacity.\n\n           The jury's affirmative response to Question #1, coupled\n\nwith its earlier finding in Phase I that Officer McClelland used\n\nexcessive force to apprehend Jarrett, established a basis for\n\nimposing liability on the Town for promulgating an unconstitutional\n\npolicy -- the precise disposition that Jarrett sought for his\n\nMonell claim.   By entering judgment on both verdicts, the district\n\ncourt   terminated     litigation   on     the   merits   with    respect    to\n\nMcClelland, Chapman and the Town, see Vaughan, 891 F.2d at 1198,\n\nthereby establishing a final, appealable decision.               Accordingly,\n\nfinding no merit in Jarrett's jurisdictional claims, we proceed to\n\naddress the alleged constitutional violation.\n\nB.   The Alleged Constitutional Violation\n\n           1.        The primacy of the constitutional question in the\n                     qualified immunity inquiry\n\n           After the jury issued its verdict against Chief Chapman\n\nin Phase II of the bifurcated proceedings, McClelland and Chapman\n\n                                    -13-\n\fmoved for judgment as a matter of law, arguing inter alia that the\n\nverdicts against them could not stand because the two officers were\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.       The district court denied their\n\nmotions, and McClelland and Chapman now argue on appeal that these\n\nrulings were in error.      \"A district court's denial of qualified\n\nimmunity is a legal question that we review de novo.\"            Davis v.\n\nRennie, 264 F.3d 86, 113 (1st Cir. 2001).        In Saucier v. Katz, 533\n\nU.S. 194 (2001), the Supreme Court offered the following general\n\nguidance to courts reviewing qualified immunity determinations: \"A\n\ncourt required to rule upon the qualified immunity issue must\n\nconsider . . . this threshold question:          Taken in the light most\n\nfavorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged\n\nshow the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right?          This\n\nmust be the initial inquiry.\"    Id. at 201.\n\n          2.       Reconciling the jury verdicts\n\n          Before   addressing   the     merits   of   the   constitutional\n\nquestion, we must establish the factual predicate for our inquiry\n\nby determining exactly what facts the jury found.           As we observed\n\nin Iacobucci v. Boulter, 193 F.3d 14 (1st Cir. 1999): \"When a\n\nqualified immunity defense is pressed after a jury verdict, the\n\nevidence must be construed in the light most hospitable to the\n\nparty that prevailed at trial . .          . [I]n such an exercise,\n\ndeference should be accorded the jury's discernible resolution of\n\ndisputed factual issues.\"    Id. at 23 (internal citations omitted).\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f              After    Phase    I    of    the        bifurcated      trial,    the jury\n\ndetermined that Officer McClelland used excessive force when he\n\nreleased Shadow.         However, this verdict is consistent with both\n\nversions of the facts set forth by the parties at trial.                             The\n\nverdict   could       have   reflected         the    jury's   belief    that    Officer\n\nMcClelland      ordered      Shadow       to    bite     and   hold     after    Jarrett\n\nsurrendered himself, in which case the appellant clearly suffered\n\na constitutional injury.            See Mendoza v. Block, 27 F.3d 1357, 1362\n\n(9th Cir. 1994) (\"[N]o particularized case law is necessary for a\n\ndeputy to know that excessive force has been used when a deputy\n\nsics a canine on a handcuffed arrestee who has fully surrendered\n\nand is completely under control.\").                  However, it is also plausible\n\nthat    the     jury     determined        that        Officer      McClelland     acted\n\nunreasonably, even while crediting his testimony that Jarrett\n\ndisregarded     McClelland's        verbal       warnings,     thereby    forcing    the\n\nofficer to release Shadow to apprehend a fleeing suspect.                          Under\n\nthese   circumstances,         it    is    not       clear   that   Jarrett's     Fourth\n\nAmendment rights would have been violated.\n\n              In resolving this factual ambiguity, we note the jury's\n\nexplicit finding in Phase II that Officer McClelland acted in\n\naccordance with the policies and procedures of the Town of Yarmouth\n\nwhen he released Shadow.              Nothing in the record suggests that\n\nYarmouth policies permit an officer to command a police dog to\n\nattack a suspect who has already surrendered.                            In fact, the\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\frelevant regulations, which the defendants introduced at trial,\n\ntightly circumscribe the situations in which police officers may\n\nuse force:\n\n                   Non-deadly force4 may be used by a police\n                   officer in the performance of his duty:\n                          a) when necessary to preserve the\n                   peace, prevent commission of offenses, or\n                   prevent suicide or self-inflicted injury; or\n                          b)   when    necessary    to   overcome\n                   resistance to lawful arrests, searches and\n                   seizures, and to prevent escapes from custody;\n                   or\n                          c) when in self-defense, or defense of\n                   another against unlawful violence to his\n                   person or property.\n\nThese regulations cannot be construed to sanction the use of any\n\nforce against a suspect who has surrendered peacefully.              Hence, no\n\nreasonable jury could accept Jarrett's version of the facts -- that\n\nhe had already surrendered when Officer McClelland released Shadow\n\n-- and simultaneously conclude that McClelland acted in accordance\n\nwith the policies and procedures of the Town of Yarmouth.\n\n                   Notably, Officer McClelland also testified during Phase\n\nI   of       the    proceedings   that   additional   department   regulations\n\ncompelled police dog handlers to announce \"Stop, police, or I'll\n\nrelease the dog\" three times before releasing, and Officer Gomsey\n\nconfirmed that this practice was \"routine.\"             Both officers further\n\ntestified that McClelland in fact issued these warnings before\n\n\n         4\n      The regulations define non-deadly force as \"that degree of\nforce which in the circumstance is neither likely nor intended to\ncause great bodily harm.\" By contrast, deadly force is narrowly\ndefined as force \"inflicted by firearms.\"\n\n                                         -16-\n\freleasing Shadow on the night in question.                At trial, no witness\n\ncontradicted the officers' testimony regarding the existence and\n\nvitality of these regulations.            Thus, if the jury ultimately found\n\nthat McClelland acted in accordance with Yarmouth policies and\n\nprocedures, they must have implicitly found that he issued the\n\nproper verbal warnings to Jarrett before releasing Shadow.\n\n             In the end, we can safely attribute the following factual\n\nfindings to the jury: 1) Officer McClelland issued three verbal\n\nwarnings to Jarrett before releasing Shadow, and 2) at the time\n\nMcClelland released Shadow, Jarrett had not surrendered to the\n\npolice, but was resisting arrest by fleeing.               The jury nonetheless\n\ndetermined that the defendant's use of force was excessive under\n\nthe circumstances.       We must now consider whether this verdict can\n\nstand as a matter of law.\n\n             3.   Officer McClelland's alleged use of excessive force\n\n             \"Where . . . the excessive force claim arises in the\n\ncontext of an arrest . . . of a free citizen, it is most properly\n\ncharacterized     as   one    invoking      the    protections   of    the   Fourth\n\nAmendment, which guarantees citizens the right 'to be secure in\n\ntheir persons . . . against unreasonable . . . seizures' of the\n\nperson.\"     Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 394 (1989).                The Graham\n\nCourt established a balancing test for determining whether a\n\nparticular    exercise       of   force    is     constitutional:     \"Determining\n\nwhether the force used to effect a particular seizure is reasonable\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\funder the Fourth Amendment requires a careful balancing of the\n\nnature and quality of the intrusion on the individual's Fourth\n\nAmendment    interests     against    the        countervailing   governmental\n\ninterests   at   stake.\"     Id.     at   396     (internal   quotation     marks\n\nomitted). Courts conducting this balancing exercise must undertake\n\na   fact-intensive   inquiry       that     is    highly   sensitive   to    the\n\ncircumstances of the particular case:\n\n            Because the test of reasonableness under the\n            Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise\n            definition or mechanical application . . . its\n            proper application requires careful attention\n            to the facts and circumstances of each\n            particular case, including the severity of the\n            crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an\n            immediate threat to the safety of the officers\n            or others, and whether he is actively\n            resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest\n            by flight.\n\nId. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In reviewing\n\nthe conduct of law enforcement officials, \"[t]he 'reasonableness'\n\nof a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of\n\na reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20\n\nvision of hindsight.\" Id. Because objective reasonableness is the\n\ntouchstone of the excessive force inquiry, the constitutional and\n\nqualified immunity inquiries in this area are closely intertwined.\n\nSee Saucier, 533 U.S. at 206.        Hence, the decisions of courts that\n\nhave previously addressed excessive force claims in the dog-biting\n\ncontext may be instructive even if these claims were ultimately\n\nresolved on qualified immunity grounds.\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f          Before turning to the Graham balancing test, we digress\n\nbriefly to resolve an issue that has been lurking in the background\n\nthroughout this litigation -- namely, whether releasing a police\n\ndog trained to bite and hold constitutes a use of deadly force.\n\nThe deadly/non-deadly distinction is significant in the Fourth\n\nAmendment context; under clearly established law, the use of deadly\n\nforce is constitutional only if, at a minimum, a suspect poses an\n\nimmediate threat to police officers or civilians. See Tennessee v.\n\nGarner, 471 U.S. 1, 11 (1985).   Here, it is undisputed that Jarrett\n\ndid not pose such a threat.      Accordingly, if the release of a\n\npolice dog is an exercise of deadly force, Officer McClelland\n\nclearly violated Jarrett's Fourth Amendment Rights by releasing\n\nShadow to apprehend the appellee as he was running away.\n\n          In the leading case of Robinette v. Barnes, 854 F.2d 909\n\n(6th Cir. 1988), the police released a dog into a building to\n\napprehend a burglary suspect.    The dog fatally wounded the suspect\n\nby biting him in the neck, and the administratrix of the decedent's\n\nestate filed a ยง 1983 action alleging that the police had used\n\n\"unnecessary deadly force.\"      Notwithstanding the fact that the\n\ndecedent was killed by the police dog, the Sixth Circuit determined\n\nthat \"the use of a properly trained police dog to apprehend a\n\nfelony suspect does not carry with it a substantial risk of causing\n\ndeath or serious bodily harm.\"      Id. at 912 (internal quotation\n\nmarks and footnote omitted). The Ninth Circuit similarly concluded\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fthat the use of police dogs trained in the \"bite and hold\"\n\ntechnique generally does not constitute deadly force, absent some\n\ndemonstration by the plaintiff \"that properly trained police dogs\n\nare reasonably capable of causing death.\"       Vera Cruz v. City of\n\nEscondido, 139 F.3d 659, 663 (9th Cir. 1997).    Jarrett points us to\n\nno contrary authority indicating that the use of trained police\n\ndogs is considered deadly force under certain circumstances.      In\n\nfact, he concedes that \"[b]ecause none of plaintiff's witnesses\n\ntestified that a police dog like McClelland's was deadly force, nor\n\ndid plaintiff's counsel argue it to the jury, and because the trial\n\ncourt rejected plaintiff's deadly force instruction, the deadly\n\nforce issue is irrelevant to this appeal.\"\n\n          Consequently, our constitutional inquiry is confined to\n\nthe question of whether Officer McClelland exercised unreasonable\n\nnon-deadly force in releasing Shadow to apprehend Jarrett.    Taking\n\ninto account the \"jury's discernible resolution of disputed factual\n\nissues,\" Iacobucci, 193 F.3d at 23, we can deduce how the relevant\n\nevents unfolded.   As Officer McClelland was being radioed to the\n\nscene, he overheard Officer White's conjecture that Jarrett was a\n\nsuspect in a prior armed robbery. McClelland arrived shortly after\n\nJarrett's unsuccessful efforts to elude two police officers ended\n\nwith him crashing his car into a cement post.       Jarrett fled the\n\nscene of this minor traffic incident, leaping a fence and racing\n\nthrough an unlit residential neighborhood in the middle of the\n\n\n                               -20-\n\fnight to avoid arrest.       Officer McClelland and Shadow finally\n\nlocated   Jarrett   after   tracking   him   for   approximately   twenty\n\nminutes, and McClelland verbally warned him three times:           \"Stop,\n\npolice, or I'll send the dog.\"     At that point Jarrett fled around\n\na corner, and McClelland released Shadow.          In the ensuing thirty\n\nseconds, Shadow apprehended Jarrett and bit him twice on the leg\n\nbefore Officer McClelland arrived and commanded Shadow to release.\n\nMcClelland immediately radioed for an ambulance that arrived within\n\nfive minutes to transport Jarrett to a hospital, and shortly\n\nthereafter the appellee received medical treatment for cuts to his\n\nlower right leg.\n\n           After finding these facts, the jurors determined that\n\nMcClelland's application of the Town's bite-and-hold policy was\n\nunreasonable, apparently because they found the policy itself to be\n\nunconstitutional.    Their indictment of the bite-and-hold policy,\n\nhowever, finds no support in the case law.          In a 1994 dog-biting\n\ncase factually similar to the case at bar, the Ninth Circuit noted\n\nthat\n\n           [w]hen the incident that led to the filing of\n           this lawsuit occurred, the use of police dogs\n           to search for and apprehend fleeing or\n           concealed suspects constituted neither a new\n           nor a unique policy. The practice was long-\n           standing, widespread, and well-known.       No\n           decision of which we are aware intimated that\n           a policy of using dogs to apprehend concealed\n           suspects, even by biting and seizing them, was\n           unlawful.   At the time of the incident in\n           question, the only reported case which had\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\f            considered the constitutionality of such a\n            policy had upheld that practice.\n\nChew   v.   Gates,   27   F.3d    1432,    1447      (9th   Cir.   1994)   (citing\n\nRobinette, 854 F.2d at 909).               We are aware of no post-Chew\n\ndecisions      suggesting        that      bite-and-hold           policies    are\n\nunconstitutional per se.         Indeed, four years after Chew, the Ninth\n\nCircuit reiterated in Watkins v. City of Oakland, 145 F.3d 1087\n\n(9th Cir. 1998), that since Chew \"there had no been no change in\n\nthe law that would have alerted [the defendant] that his use of a\n\npolice dog to search and bite was unconstitutional.\"                 Id. at 1092.\n\n            The jury thus had no basis to conclude that the Town of\n\nYarmouth's    bite-and-hold       policy       was    unconstitutional.        Our\n\ndetermination that there is no record support for finding bite-and-\n\nhold policies unconstitutional on their face, however, still leaves\n\nopen the question of whether the particular use of bite-and-hold\n\nforce at issue here was excessive under the circumstances. Without\n\nexcluding the importance of other factors, the Graham Court focused\n\nits reasonableness inquiry on three factors in particular:                      1)\n\nwhether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to\n\nevade arrest by flight, 2) whether the suspect poses an immediate\n\nthreat to the safety of the officers or others, and 3) the severity\n\nof the crime at issue.           Graham, 490 U.S. at 396.            As discussed\n\nearlier, the jury must have concluded that Jarrett was \"attempting\n\nto evade arrest by flight\" when McClelland released Shadow.                   With\n\nregard to the second factor, McClelland could reasonably have\n\n                                        -22-\n\fconcluded that Jarrett posed a threat to the safety of residents in\n\nthe neighborhood where the chase occurred.                  Jarrett's behavior\n\nafter the car accident was erratic, and tended to confirm Officer\n\nWhite's suspicion that Jarrett was a suspect in a prior armed\n\nrobbery.     McClelland could not discern whether Jarrett was armed\n\ngiven the limited visibility, or predict the lengths to which\n\nJarrett would go to avoid arrest.               The third Graham factor (the\n\nseverity of the crime at issue) slightly undermines the objective\n\nreasonableness of McClelland's actions.                 At the time McClelland\n\nreleased Shadow, he knew with certainty only that Jarrett had\n\ncommitted several minor traffic infractions.              However, this factor\n\nalone is not dispositive, see Graham, 490 U.S. at 396, and we note\n\nthat at least one other court has upheld the reasonableness of\n\npolice-dog       bites    where    the    victim    was    only     suspected   of\n\nmisdemeanors, see Matthews v. Jones, 35 F.3d 1046, 1048 (6th Cir.\n\n1994).\n\n            In    the    final    analysis,     after   reviewing    McClelland's\n\nactions without \"the 20/20 vision of hindsight,\" Graham, 490 U.S.\n\nat 396, we simply do not find that McClelland's decision to release\n\nShadow was an exercise of objectively unreasonable force under the\n\ncircumstances.      Our legal conclusion that McClelland did not use\n\nexcessive force to apprehend Jarrett is not inconsistent with the\n\njury's determination after Phase I that Jarrett did use excessive\n\nforce.     As discussed earlier, it appears that the jury initially\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fconcluded that the Town of Yarmouth's bite-and-hold policy was\n\nunconstitutional, and reasoned that any application of that policy\n\nmust be unconstitutional per se.    Their reasoning was erroneous as\n\na matter of law. We conclude after conducting the Graham balancing\n\ntest that Officer McClelland's release of a dog trained to bite and\n\nhold did not violate Jarrett's Fourth Amendment rights as a matter\n\nof law.\n\n          Our determination that Jarrett suffered no constitutional\n\ninjury is dispositive of his municipal liability claim against the\n\nTown of Yarmouth.   As the Supreme Court observed in City of Los\n\nAngeles v. Heller, 475 U.S. 796 (1986):\n\n          [N]either Monell . . . nor any other of our\n          cases authorizes the award of damages against\n          a municipal corporation based on the actions\n          of one of its officers when in fact the\n          [court] has concluded that the officer\n          inflicted no constitutional harm. If a person\n          has suffered no constitutional injury at the\n          hands of the individual police officer, the\n          fact that the departmental regulations might\n          have authorized the use of constitutionally\n          excessive force is quite beside the point.\n\nId. at 799 (original emphasis).    Consequently, Jarrett's municipal\n\nliability claim against the Town of Yarmouth must fail as a matter\n\nof law.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n          We conclude that Officer McClelland did not violate\n\nJarrett's Fourth Amendment rights by using excessive force to\n\napprehend him on the night in question.      In the absence of any\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\fconstitutional violation, the verdicts against Officer McClelland,\n\nChief Chapman and the Town of Yarmouth must be vacated.       The\n\ndecision of the district court is reversed, and this case is\n\nremanded for entry of judgment in favor of defendants McClelland,\n\nChapman, and the Town of Yarmouth.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -25-\n\f",

Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early morning hours of December 16, 1994, Jerome Jarrett attracted the attention of a Yarmouth Police officer by sitting in his car in a motel parking lot off Route 28. That officer, Gerard Britt, decided to follow Jarrett after seeing Jarrett exit the motel parking lot and quickly head in the opposite direction on Route 28. Officer Britt also radioed to another Yarmouth police officer, Richard White, who Officer Britt knew was in the vicinity. Consequently, two Yarmouth police officers ended up following Jarrett. However, neither of the officers activated his lights nor tried to stop Jarrett. Officer Britt simply clocked Jarrett's speed as in excess of sixty miles per hour.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After several minutes, Jarrett exited into another parking lot off Route 28. Officer White followed Jarrett into this parking lot while Officer Britt continued on Route 28, entering the parking lot from the opposite end. Now heading toward Jarrett's oncoming car, Officer Britt activated his lights. Jarrett did not stop. Rather, according to the testimony of Officers Britt and White, Jarrett and Officer Britt barely avoided colliding, and Officer Britt had to swerve abruptly. In contrast, Jarrett claimed that there was no near collision and that he never saw Officer Britt heading toward him. The parties agree, however, that Jarrett then continued into an adjoining parking lot where he hit a cement post. After hitting the post, Jarrett abandoned his car and fled, scaling a nearby fence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, there were two additional Yarmouth police officers in the vicinity: Officer Cheryl Nugent Gomsey and Officer Peter McClelland. Officer Gomsey had seen Jarrett driving quickly on Route 28, followed by the two officers in their marked patrol cars. She also saw Jarrett hit the post and run away. Officer McClelland had been attracted by radio communications made by Officers White and Britt, and he arrived shortly after Jarret had fled. In fact, Officer McClelland saw Jarrett hit the post and flee from a distance. One of the radio dispatches overheard by Officer McClelland was Officer White saying that he recognized the driver of the car, Jarrett, as a suspect in a prior armed robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Armed with only the information that Jarrett was wanted for several misdemeanor violations and had possibly been involved in a prior armed robbery, Officers McClelland and Gomsey undertook to track and apprehend Jarrett. Officer McClelland, the K-9 officer for the Yarmouth Police, also took his dog, Shadow, to assist in finding Jarrett. Shadow, after being helped over the fence, was placed on his usual 15-foot lead. He then began tracking Jarrett with Officer McClelland running closely behind. Officer Gomsey jogged after them, keeping some distance behind so as to not contaminate the track. The area through which Shadow led the officers was residential and the path circuitous. According to the testimony of Officer McClelland, after he had been running for slightly less than twenty minutes, he saw a man standing in the middle of the road, about fifty yards away. At this point, Officer Gomsey had fallen behind and could not see Officer McClelland, Shadow, or Jarrett. Officer McClelland testified that he shouted, three times, \"Stop, police or I'll send the dog.\" Officer Gomsey confirmed, in her testimony, that Officer McClelland issued several verbal warnings, which is \"normal [and] routine.\" After issuing these warnings, Officer McClelland testified that the suspect accelerated, disappearing around the corner. Only then, according to Officer McClelland, did he release Shadow with the directive to locate the suspect and hold him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shadow was trained under a \"bite and hold\" policy. This means that when he locates his target, Shadow will bite and maintain his hold until told to release. However, if the suspect struggles, the dog may lose his grip and rebite. This may cause the dog to bite several times, as it tries to maintain its hold. The uncontroverted evidence showed that \"bite and hold\" policies are the standard in the United States. An alternative, not widely adopted, is the \"circle and bark\" method. Under that training, a dog will circle his target, barking, until his handler arrives. If the target attempts to escape or begins to move, the dog will bite. Because Shadow was trained under the \"bite and hold\" method, Officer McClelland knew, when he released Shadow, that there was a high probability that the dog would bite the fleeing suspect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After being released, Shadow followed the man and disappeared around the corner. According to Officer McClelland, Shadow was only out of his sight for thirty seconds, and when he found Shadow, Shadow had apprehended Jarrett by biting him on the leg. Officer McClelland then testified that he commanded Shadow to release Jarrett, and Shadow did. After Shadow released, Officer McClelland handcuffed Jarrett and called for backup. An ambulance arrived within five minutes and transported Jarrett to the hospital where he received treatment, including several stitches, and was released.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, Jarrett recounted a slightly different version of events. He testified that he had just picked up his car, recently purchased, after finishing his shift at work. As he drove through Yarmouth, he claims to have not noticed the police officers who were following him. Instead, he was having problems with his brakes and pulled into the parking lot to try to slow down. While in the parking lot, shortly before hitting the cement pole, Jarrett noticed the police lights, but he did not see a police cruiser heading toward his car at any point. After hitting the post, Jarrett decided to run away. He was afraid of being arrested because he was driving illegally and was on probation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jarrett said that after he jumped the fence, he got up and began to run. Within five seconds, he heard someone yell, \"Stop.\" He apparently had fallen down at that point, and as he got back up, Jarrett heard someone say, \"Stop or I'll let the dog go.\" Jarrett testified that he then stopped, placing his hands in the air. Then, he felt a dog jump on his back. A command was issued, by an unseen person, in a foreign language, and the dog bit him on the leg, at least twice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the events of that evening, Jarrett was eventually charged with several misdemeanor offenses: (1) operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license; (2) leaving the scene of an accident; (3) operating an uninsured motor vehicle; and (4) failing to stop for a police officer. He was also charged with several civil infractions: (1) operating an unregistered motor vehicle; (2) failing to yield at an intersection; (3) speeding; and (4) operating a motor vehicle with defective equipment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jarrett originally filed his complaint in the District Court of Massachusetts alleging that Officer Peter McClelland used excessive force when he released Shadow, an \"instrument of potentially deadly force.\" Jarrett also sued the Chief of the Yarmouth Police, Robert Chapman, for tolerating a pattern and practice of excessive force by Officer McClelland.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After defendants' motion to dismiss on the grounds of qualified immunity was denied, the case proceeded to a bifurcated jury trial. In the first stage, the jury considered Jarrett's excessive force claim against Officer McClelland. They returned a verdict in favor of Jarrett, finding that Officer McClelland used excessive force. They awarded compensatory damages in the amount of one dollar and no punitive damages. Also, the jury, without being asked to do so, independently recommended that the Town of Yarmouth adopt a new standard for training its police dogs. Specifically, they recommended that \"the Town of Yarmouth be required from this time forward to .... retrain current K-9 units and train all future K-9 units to use the find and bark method.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury returned this verdict, defendants-appellants filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law arguing that both Officer McClelland and Chief Chapman are entitled to qualified immunity. The district court denied this motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial then proceeded to its second phase, against Chief Chapman.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> There, the jury found that Officer McClelland had acted in accordance with the Town's policy and procedures when he released Shadow. The jury also found that Chief Chapman had \"permitted and tolerated a pattern and practice of unjustified, unreasonable and excessive force by Officer Peter McClelland with respect to the latter's deployment of the dog, Shadow.\" After some confusion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the jury awarded $50,000 in punitive damages to Jarrett.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this second verdict, defendants-appellants filed another motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for a new trial, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b). In support, defendants-appellants argued that the evidence did not support either verdict and, in the alternative, that both defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. The district court denied the motion, and defendants-appellants filed their notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants-appellants raise multiple issues before this Court. We begin with the most promising of their arguments, that the district court erred in denying their motions for judgment as a matter of law on the grounds of qualified immunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a Rule 50(b) motion <i>de novo. Quint v. A.E. Staley Mfg. Co.,</i> 172 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1999). However, in conducting that review, we interpret the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>Sheek v. Asia Badger, Inc.,</i> 235 F.3d 687, 699 (1st Cir.2000). We will not judge witnesses' credibility or evidence's weight. <i>Id.</i> at 700. We also will reconcile factual conflicts in favor of the verdict and uphold that verdict unless the evidence only supports one conclusion, that the verdict cannot stand. <i>Walton v. Nalco Chem. Co.,</i> 272 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Reconciling the jury verdicts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents a slightly different challenge because we must first determine what the jury found. When we are confronted with potentially inconsistent jury verdicts, we must do our best to reconcile those verdicts. <i>See Gallick v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co.,</i> 372 U.S. 108, 119, 83 S.Ct. 659, 9 L.Ed.2d 618 (1963) (holding that \"it is the duty of the courts to attempt to harmonize\" jury verdicts); <i>Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Ellerman Lines, Ltd.,</i> 369 U.S. 355, 358-59 &amp; 364, 82 S.Ct. 780, 7 L.Ed.2d 798 (1962) (holding that while appellate courts should not redetermine facts found by a jury, it is their duty to view a jury's findings in a consistent manner); <i>cf. City of Los Angeles v. Heller,</i> 475 U.S. 796, 799, 106 S.Ct. 1571, 89 L.Ed.2d 806 (1986) (per curiam) (holding that in a bifurcated trial of an excessive force claim if a jury finds no constitutional violation by the individual police officer, the court will not proceed to consider the claim against the municipality or supervisor because to do so would be to invite inconsistent verdicts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first stage of the trial, the jury found that Officer McClelland had used excessive force when he released Shadow, who subsequently bit Jarrett. There are two possible theories that could support the verdict. First, the jury could have believed Jarrett's story that he had clearly surrendered before Officer McClelland ordered Shadow to bite. No one disputes that, if this occurred, it is a violation of Jarrett's Fourth Amendment rights and no qualified immunity defense can be made. <i>See Mendoza v. Block,</i> 27 F.3d 1357, 1362 (9th Cir.1994) (\"[N]o particularized case law is necessary for a deputy to know that excessive force has been used when a deputy sics a canine on a handcuffed arrestee who has fully surrendered and is completely under control.\"). Second, the jury could have accepted appellants' version of events but found that Officer McClelland still acted unreasonably under the circumstances. Under this version, Officer McClelland released Shadow after issuing three verbal warnings and while Jarrett continued to flee. If this version is true, appellants argue that Officer McClelland is nevertheless protected by qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Normally, we would not have to resolve this dispute. We would just view the verdict in the light most favorable to Jarrett, the prevailing party, and uphold the result. <i>See Walton,</i> 272 F.3d at 18. Here, however, we must reconcile the verdict against Officer McClelland with the verdict against Chief Chapman, and the interpretation supported by Jarrett's testimony cannot be attuned with the jury's verdict in the second part of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After finding that Officer McClelland acted with excessive force, the same jury explicitly found that Officer McClelland acted in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Town of Yarmouth when he released Shadow. There is no evidence in the record that Yarmouth policies allow an officer to order a dog to attack a suspect who has already surrendered. In fact, the only evidence in the record is precisely to the contrary. The police regulations, introduced at trial, clearly stipulate that force may only be used in specific situations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Non-deadly force may be used by a police officer in the performance of his duty:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. when necessary to preserve the peace, prevent commission of offenses, or prevent suicide or self-inflicted injury; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. when necessary to overcome resistance to lawful arrests, searches and seizures, and to prevent escapes from custody; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. when in self-defense, or defense of another against unlawful violence to his person or property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No language in this regulation could possibly support a finding that it is the policy of the Yarmouth police to use <i>any</i> level of force against a suspect who has peacefully surrendered. No contrary regulations were introduced by plaintiff, and plaintiff did not argue that there was an unwritten policy of using force against such suspects. Therefore, no reasonable jury could have concluded both that Officer McClelland knew that Jarrett had surrendered when Shadow was released and that Officer McClelland acted in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Town of Yarmouth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Officer McClelland explicitly testified that he was required to announce, \"Stop, police or I'll release the dog,\" three times before releasing Shadow and that he did so before releasing Shadow to apprehend Jarrett. Officer Gomsey confirmed that it was \"routine\" to make such an announcement and that Officer McClelland had issued such a warning. The plaintiff introduced no evidence to suggest that Officer McClelland was not trained in such a way. In fact, plaintiff never contested that proper procedures required Officer McClelland to make this announcement. Therefore, because the jury found that Officer McClelland acted in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Town of Yarmouth, the jury must have also found that Officer McClelland verbally warned Jarrett before releasing Shadow. It is the only possible interpretation of the jury's finding, in light of the introduced evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the jury must have found that Officer McClelland did not know that Jarrett had surrendered and that Officer McClelland issued the required warnings before releasing Shadow, the jury must have found that the release of Shadow was still excessive force under the circumstances. In other words, the jury must have believed Officer McClelland's story but still found that the force he used was unreasonable in light of the circumstances. We must then consider whether this verdict can stand as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Qualified Immunity for Officer McClelland</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer McClelland raised the defense of qualified immunity before, during, and after the trial, and he renews that claim before us. Whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity is a question of law, to be determined by the courts. <i>Starlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto,</i> 253 F.3d 137, 141 (1st Cir.2001). We therefore review the question <i>de novo. Davis v. Rennie,</i> 264 F.3d 86, 113 (1st Cir.2001). While courts normally determine whether qualified immunity is available prior to trial, there are cases where a jury needs to resolve crucial factual questions before a court can resolve the qualified immunity question. <i>Kelley v. LaForce,</i> 288 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense for government officials in &#167; 1983 suits which allege constitutional violations. The doctrine shields officials from civil damages liability so long as their actions do not \"violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" <i>Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). Practically, \"whether an official protected by qualified immunity may be held personally liable for an allegedly unlawful action generally turns on the objective legal reasonableness of the action, assessed in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the time it was taken.\" <i>Anderson v. Creighton,</i> 483 U.S. 635, 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine whether a government official is protected by qualified immunity, courts make two inquiries: (1) whether the plaintiff suffered a constitutional injury, <i>Wilson v. Layne,</i> 526 U.S. 603, 609, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999), and (2) whether \"an objectively reasonable official would have believed that his conduct was lawful `in light of clearly established law and the information that the official possessed at the time of his allegedly unlawful conduct,'\" <i>Kelley,</i> 288 F.3d at 6 (quoting <i>McBride v. Taylor,</i> 924 F.2d 386, 389 (1st Cir.1991)). <i>Accord Wilson,</i> 526 U.S. at 609, 119 S.Ct. 1692.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Jarrett alleged that Officer McClelland acted unreasonably when he released Shadow and that this release constituted excessive force. The Fourth Amendment protects against the use of excessive force in the course of arrests and investigatory stops. U.S. Const. amend. IV (protecting against \"unreasonable\" seizures); <i>see also Graham v. Connor,</i> 490 U.S. 386, 395, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (holding that all claims of excessive force should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment); <i>Aponte Matos v. Toledo D&#225;vila,</i> 135 F.3d 182, 191 (1st Cir. 1998) (same). The jury agreed and found that Officer McClelland acted with excessive force when he released Shadow, knowing only that Jarrett was wanted for minor traffic violations and may have been previously wanted in connection with an armed robbery. We assume, <i>arguendo,</i> that there is sufficient evidence to support this finding and that Jarrett suffered a constitutional injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, \"even state actors who commit constitutional violations may be entitled to qualified immunity,\" <i>Camilo-Robles v. Hoyos,</i> 151 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1998), depending on whether they acted in an objectively reasonable manner under clearly established law, <i>Kelley,</i> 288 F.3d at 6. We then turn to the second part of the qualified immunity inquiry: whether a reasonable officer would have believed that releasing a trained police dog to apprehend Jarrett was lawful in light of both clearly established law and the particular circumstances of that night. <i>See Wilson,</i> 526 U.S. at 609, 119 S.Ct. 1692; <i>Kelley,</i> 288 F.3d at 6. At the time that Officer McClelland released Shadow, in December 1994, several major cases had addressed the use of trained police dogs to apprehend suspects. We now turn to an examination of those cases to determine what a reasonable officer would have known on the night in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with an issue which has been lurking in the background, although appellee now disclaims any explicit attachment. The issue is whether the use of police dogs to apprehend suspects by biting them constitutes deadly force.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> This is an important question because the Supreme Court has outlined specific rules governing the use of deadly force to seize suspects. <i>See Tennessee v. Garner,</i> 471 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). At a minimum, <i>Garner</i> requires that a suspect pose an immediate threat before an officer can use deadly force. <i>Id.</i> at 11, 105 S.Ct. 1694. Nothing in the record supports the conclusion that Jarrett posed an immediate threat to anyone. Under these circumstances and clearly established law, no reasonable officer would have believed deadly force was justified. Therefore, if a reasonable officer should have believed that releasing Shadow was deadly force, Officer McClelland is not entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the earliest, and most important, opinions regarding the use of police dogs addressed whether their deployment is deadly force. In <i>Robinette v. Barnes,</i> 854 F.2d 909 (6th Cir.1988), the police, in the course of investigating a suspected burglary, released a dog into a building, believing that their suspect was inside. <i>Id.</i> at 911. The police issued several verbal warnings and then set the dog free, with the command, \"Find him.\" <i>Id.</i> When the dog found the suspect, the dog bit the suspect in the neck. <i>Id.</i> The victim quickly died from his wound. <i>Id.</i> The administratrix of the decedent's estate then brought suit under the Fourth Amendment and alleged the use of \"unnecessary deadly force.\" <i>Id.</i> Despite the fact that a death resulted, the Sixth Circuit held that \"the use of a properly trained police dog to apprehend a felony suspect does not carry with it a `substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily harm.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 912. <i>Robinette</i> thus established a baseline presumption that releases pursuant to general \"bite and hold\" policies are subject only to the rules governing the use of non-deadly force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequent cases have consistently followed this approach and held that the use of police dogs does not constitute deadly force. <i>See Vera Cruz v. City of Escondido,</i> 139 F.3d 659 (9th Cir.1998) (holding that the plaintiff failed to present evidence that the use of a trained police dog presents more than a remote possibility of death and therefore plaintiff was not entitled to a deadly force instruction); <i>cf. Quintanilla v. City of Downey,</i> 84 F.3d 353 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that because the plaintiff suffered only non-life threatening injuries, did not require serious medical attention, and the dog released on command, he was not entitled to a deadly force instruction). Consequently, it is far from clearly established law that the use of trained police dogs to bite and detain suspects is deadly force, subject to the requirements of <i>Garner,</i> and no reasonable officer would have believed himself constrained by the rules governing the use of deadly force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This, however, does not completely answer the question of whether a reasonable officer in December of 1994 would have known that releasing a dog pursuant to a general \"bite and hold\" policy, like the Town of Yarmouth's policy, is unconstitutional. We note first that there is no case that has held these policies to be unconstitutional. Only one case, decided by a district court, could be read to suggest that acting pursuant to such policies raises constitutional problems of which a reasonable officer should be aware. In <i>Marley v. City of Allentown,</i> 774 F.Supp. 343 (E.D.Pa.1991), <i>aff'd</i> 961 F.2d 1567 (3d Cir. 1992), the court held that an officer who released his dog to apprehend a misdemeanor suspect acted in an objectively unreasonable manner under the Fourth Amendment. <i>Id.</i> at 345-46. However, the court also relied upon the fact that evidence suggested that the suspect had visibly surrendered before the officer released the dog. <i>Id.</i> at 346. Therefore, it is hard to accord any particular significance to the decision in <i>Marley</i> because everyone agrees that siccing a dog upon a compliant suspect is a clear constitutional violation. <i>Mendoza,</i> 27 F.3d at 1362.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, other courts have concluded that \"bite and hold\" policies are not contrary to clearly established law. In <i>Watkins v. City of Oakland,</i> 145 F.3d 1087 (9th Cir.1998), the Ninth Circuit addressed an incident which occurred on November 20, 1993, slightly more than one year before the event of which Jarrett complains. There, the court determined that a \"`bite and hold' policy did not violate clearly established law concerning the use of excessive force.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1092. Additionally, an officer acting in accordance with that policy would be entitled to qualified immunity. <i>Id.</i> In reaching this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit found that <i>Marley</i> failed to provide \"sufficient notice\" that acting under typical \"bite and hold\" policies could be unconstitutional. <i>Id.</i> at 1092 n. 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than finding releases pursuant to \"bite and hold\" policies to be constitutionally questionable, courts have principally worried about releases that did not comport with those policies. For example, in <i>Watkins,</i> the court denied summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity because the plaintiff testified that the officer had allowed the dog to continue biting even after the plaintiff was fully compliant and no longer posed a threat. <i>Id.</i> at 1093. In <i>Vathekan v. Prince George's County,</i> 154 F.3d 173 (4th Cir.1998), the Fourth Circuit concentrated on the issue of notice. <i>Id.</i> at 179. That case dealt with a truly horrific scenario where the police had released a dog into an occupied home, reasonably believing that a burglar might be lurking inside. <i>Id.</i> at 176. Instead of finding a burglar, the dog attacked the lawful resident who was asleep in her bed, crushing her skull. <i>Id.</i> at 177. The court denied summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity because it found that there was a genuine issue as to whether the officers had issued a verbal warning before releasing the dog. <i>Id.</i> at 180-81. Furthermore, the court held that, as of 1995, it was objectively unreasonable to release a police dog without first giving a verbal warning. <i>Id.</i> at 179. This decision, however, suggests that a release that follows a verbal warning would raise no constitutional problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, however, one way in which the instant case differs from <i>Robinette, Watkins,</i> and <i>Vathekan</i> and instead resembles <i>Marley:</i> Jarrett was only suspected of having committed misdemeanors and traffic violations, not any felonies. <i>Marley</i> certainly suggests that using a police dog to apprehend a \"fleeing misdemeanant\" is objectively unreasonable and, hence, unconstitutional. 774 F.Supp. at 345-46; <i>cf. Mendoza v. Block,</i> 27 F.3d 1357, 1362-63 (9th Cir.1994) (emphasizing both the fact that the dog bite victim was wanted for a bank robbery, a felony, and the additional facts that the suspect was possibly armed and hiding on private property when holding that the officer acted in an objectively reasonable manner when he released his dog).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Furthermore, the Supreme Court has explicitly directed the courts to consider the severity of the crimes involved when evaluating excessive force claims. <i>Graham,</i> 490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865. Courts are supposed to look to \"the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\" <i>Id.; accord Gaudreault v. Municipality of Salem,</i> 923 F.2d 203, 205 (1st Cir.1990) (per curiam). Therefore, it is clearly established law, and was so in December of 1994, that officers should consider the type of crime for which a suspect is wanted when deciding what level of force is appropriate. This, however, is hardly determinative. <i>Graham</i> and other cases make clear that the severity of the crime at issue is not the only fact of importance, rather it is to be weighed in light of other surrounding circumstances. <i>See, e.g., Graham,</i> 490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, another influential Sixth Circuit case held that it was objectively reasonable to use a dog to apprehend a particular misdemeanor suspect. <i>Matthews v. Jones,</i> 35 F.3d 1046 (6th Cir.1994). The facts of that case were actually very similar to the case at bar. In <i>Matthews,</i> a police officer attempted to stop a driver who was speeding and driving erratically. <i>Id.</i> at 1048. A car chase ensued which ended when the driver pulled into some woods and fled on foot. <i>Id.</i> Shortly thereafter, a K-9 unit arrived on the scene and began to track the fleeing driver. <i>Id.</i> The dog eventually signaled that he had found the target but did not bite. <i>Id.</i> The officers then ordered the driver to stay still. <i>Id.</i> The driver did not comply, and the dog bit him. <i>Id.</i> Based on these facts, the Sixth Circuit concluded that \"there is no evidence whatever in this record which could support a claim that [the dog] was not used in an `appropriate manner.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 1051 (citing <i>Robinette,</i> 854 F.2d at 913). Therefore, the court concluded \"that no reasonable jury could conclude that the use of the police dog to apprehend Matthews was not objectively reasonable.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1052.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Officer McClelland knew that he was chasing Jarrett, who was wanted for several misdemeanor and traffic violations. This, however, was not all. Officer McClelland had overheard Officer White say that Jarrett had been a suspect in a prior armed robbery. Jarrett had fled from a seemingly inconsequential accident, a suspicious reaction. Furthermore, Jarrett was fleeing through a residential neighborhood in the middle of the night. It was difficult to see, and Officer McClelland had no way of knowing whether Jarrett was armed or not. Under these circumstances, taking into account the disposition of prior cases, it was not clearly established that releasing Shadow would be excessive force. In fact, the situation was very similar to that addressed in <i>Matthews</i> where the Fourth Circuit held that releasing the dog was objectively reasonable. <i>Id.</i> Therefore, Officer McClelland is properly entitled to qualified immunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Qualified Immunity for Chief Chapman</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chief Chapman also raised the affirmative defense of qualified immunity before the district court and reasserts that defense before us. Like individual officers, supervisors can also avail themselves of the protections of qualified immunity. <i>Camilo-Robles,</i> 151 F.3d at 5-6. In order for a supervisor to be held liable for the actions of a subordinate under &#167; 1983, two conditions must be fulfilled: (1) the subordinate must have committed a constitutional violation, and (2) \"it was clearly established that a supervisor would be liable for constitutional violations perpetrated by his subordinates in that context.\" <i>Id.</i> at 6. Again, we assume, <i>arguendo,</i> that Officer McClelland violated Jarrett's Fourth Amendment rights. Therefore, Chief Chapman can be held liable if his actions predictably led to Officer McClelland's use of excessive force, either by creating a policy or being deliberately indifferent to possible constitutional violations by his subordinates. <i>Id.</i> at 6-7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed above, in December 1994, it was not clearly established that apprehension of suspects pursuant to \"bite and hold\" policies created constitutional problems. <i>See Watkins,</i> 145 F.3d at 1091. In fact, the Ninth Circuit had specifically held that, as of 1993, a chief of police was entitled to qualified immunity because there was no clearly established law against \"bite and hold\" policies. <i>Id.</i> at 1094 n. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ninth Circuit, a frequent arbiter of excessive force cases involving dog bites, has recognized that \"bite and hold\" is \"neither a new nor a unique policy.\" <i>Chew,</i> 27 F.3d at 1447. In fact, training dogs in accordance with this policy is \"long-standing, widespread, and well-known.\" <i>Id.</i> This decision, issued a mere four months prior to the night in question, found that Los Angeles' \"bite and hold\" policy did not violate the clearly established laws regarding both the training and deployment of police dogs. <i>Id.</i> at 1448. The court continued to find:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]e simply do not believe that, given the historical facts and circumstances, the use of police dogs in the manner prescribed in the Los Angeles Police Department's policy is sufficiently similar to other uses of force held to be unconstitutional by the courts to put reasonable law enforcement officials on notice that the department's policy violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1450. The court relied upon that finding to conclude that the officers responsible for promulgating the \"bite and hold\" policy were entitled to qualified immunity. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This, however, is only half of the <i>Chew</i> court's decision. The Ninth Circuit also reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the city and allowed the plaintiff to pursue his claim that the \"bite and hold\" policy, itself, was unconstitutional. <i>Id.</i> at 1439-40. The city, which cannot invoke the protections of qualified immunity, prevailed below by convincing the district court that this particular dog release was objectively reasonable. <i>Id.</i> at 1439. The Ninth Circuit concluded that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the officer actually acted in accordance with city policy. <i>Id.</i> at 1440. While this theory does not implicate the general constitutionality of the policy, the court specifically allowed the plaintiff to proceed on the alternate theory that the policy was unconstitutional. <i>Id.</i> This decision, then, establishes that \"bite and hold\" policies are open to constitutional challenges. It does not, however, establish that they are unconstitutional. <i>Id.</i> at 1451.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While <i>Chew</i> allowed a constitutional challenge to a \"bite and hold\" policy to proceed, it can hardly be considered a clear statement alerting police supervisors that their \"bite and hold\" policies are unconstitutional. In fact, the <i>Chew</i> decision hardly changed the legal landscape; it just allowed a challenge to proceed. Additionally, the evidence presented in the case at bar only supports the conclusion that such policies continue to be the norm across the country. Therefore, we hold, that as of December 1994, the law was not clearly established that a supervisor could be held liable for the actions of an officer acting pursuant to a \"bite and hold\" policy and that as a result such a supervisor is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This, however, does not determine the question as to Chief Chapman because Jarrett also alleged that the chief had failed to adequately train and supervise Officer McClelland. While a supervisor may indeed be held liable for failure to adequately train or supervise, <i>see, e.g., Aponte Matos,</i> 135 F.3d at 192 (noting that a supervisor may be held liable for failure to discipline a \"miscreant officer\"), Jarrett's failure to train argument essentially boils down to a complaint with the \"bite and hold\" policy in Yarmouth. He does not allege that Officer McClelland was improperly trained under this policy. In fact, all the evidence supports the conclusion that Officer McClelland was exceptionally well-trained. The uncontradicted testimony was that Officer McClelland and Shadow were one of the highest-rated K-9 teams in the nation. They had even been recognized internationally. Rather than attacking the substantial training that Officer McClelland and Shadow received, Jarrett essentially alleges that Chief Chapman was deliberately indifferent because he allowed the \"bite and hold\" policy in Yarmouth to stand. This argument is no different than claiming that Chief Chapman is liable because he promulgated a \"bite and hold\" policy, and, as such, Chief Chapman is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because both the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity, we reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Reversed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Jarrett also sued three other police officers, Gerard Britt, Cheryl Nugent Gomsey, and Richard White, and the Town of Yarmouth (\"Town\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> On the night of December 16, 1994, there was an outstanding warrant for Jarrett's arrest. There had been a surrender hearing for which he had not appeared. However, it is undisputed that none of the officers knew that there was an outstanding warrant for Jarrett's arrest when they were chasing him</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Jarrett also sued the Town of Yarmouth (\"Town\") and Officers White, Britt, and Gomsey.

Therefore, the jury's admonishment has no binding effect and imposes no liability upon the Town</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The record certainly creates some confusion as to whether the Town was a defendant during the second phase of the trial or whether the Town had been dismissed. A colloquy that occurred before phase two began possibly led plaintiff to believe that the Town had been reinstated as a defendant, although it could only be subject to a possible attorney's fees award. In fact, the only relief sought in the second phase was punitive damages, and all the parties recognize that the Town is immune from such damages<i>See City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.,</i> 453 U.S. 247, 101 S.Ct. 2748, 69 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981). At various points in the record, the court and the defendants specify that only Chief Chapman is a defendant during phase two because of the Town's immunity. Only the plaintiff tries to insert references to the Town as a defendant, although never specifying the relief sought from the Town.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">This possible confusion, however, is not enough to actually make the Town a defendant. The record is clear that the Town was never identified, by the court, as a defendant. The jury instructions contain no reference to the Town as a defendant, and the verdict form specifies that Chief Chapman is the defendant without making any similar assertion about the Town. In regard to Chief Chapman, the verdict form asks:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Has the plaintiff proved by a preponderance of the evidence that <i>the defendant, Robert Chapman, as Chief of the Yarmouth Police department,</i> permitted and tolerated a pattern and practice of unjustified, unreasonable and excessive force by Officer Peter McClelland with respect to the latter's deployment of the dog, Shadow?</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added). In marked contrast, the verdict form does not identify the Town as a defendant; it simply asks if Officer McClelland acted \"in accordance with the Town of Yarmouth [sic] policy and procedure.\" Because neither the jury instructions nor the verdict form asked the jury to judge the Town's liability or award any damages against it, the Town cannot be considered a defendant. Jarrett did not object to these instructions and, thus, lost any right to complain. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 (establishing that failure to object to a jury instruction waives the right to appeal any error). Furthermore, these questions were placed before the jury not only without objection from plaintiff but at his behest. If plaintiff intended the town to be a defendant, he should have been more specific. <i>See Figueroa-Torres v. Toledo-D&#225;vila,</i> 232 F.3d 270, 272 (1st Cir.2000) (holding that defendant who failed to object to verdict form that did not require jury to specify basis of liability waived right to complain).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The jury originally awarded plaintiff attorney's fees and expenses.

City of West Palm Beach,</i> 875 F.2d 1546 (11th Cir.1989), which he claims supports the proposition that using dogs to apprehend misdemeanor suspects is unconstitutional. That case, however, dealt with three apprehensions where the officers had ordered their dogs to bite suspects without allowing the suspects to first surrender or after the suspects had actually surrendered. <i>Id.</i> at 1551-52. This is conduct that everyone agrees constitutes excessive force, whether the suspect is wanted for a felony or a misdemeanor. As such, its holding hardly supports a general claim that using police dogs against misdemeanor suspects may be constitutionally invalid.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> It is important to note the limited nature of our holding. We do not declare that Officer McClelland acted in an objectively reasonable manner. In fact, we assume,<i>arguendo,</i> that the jury reached the correct conclusion when it found that Officer McClelland acted unreasonably. Rather, we find that he acted reasonably under clearly established law. <i>See Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (emphasizing that the reasonableness prongs for excessive force and qualified immunity are distinct inquiries).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Jarrett subsequently sued Officer McClelland and the Yarmouth Chief of Police, Robert Chapman, under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, alleging, inter alia, that Officer McClelland had used excessive force when he released Shadow and that Chief Chapman tolerated a policy which created a pattern of unconstitutional conduct by Yarmouth police officers and, specifically, Officer McClelland.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> After a bifurcated trial, a jury returned verdicts in favor of Jarrett against both Officer McClelland and Chief Chapman. The defendants appeal the verdicts, raising a whole host of challenges. After careful review, we reverse the judgments on the grounds of qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early morning hours of December 16, 1994, Jerome Jarrett attracted the attention of a Yarmouth Police officer by sitting in his car in a motel parking lot off Route 28. That officer, Gerard Britt, decided to follow Jarrett after seeing Jarrett exit the motel parking lot and quickly head in the opposite direction on Route 28. Officer Britt also radioed to another Yarmouth police officer, Richard White, who Officer Britt knew was in the vicinity. Consequently, two Yarmouth police officers ended up following Jarrett. However, neither of the officers activated his lights nor tried to stop Jarrett. Officer Britt simply clocked Jarrett's speed as in excess of sixty miles per hour.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After several minutes, Jarrett exited into another parking lot off Route 28. Officer White followed Jarrett into this parking lot while Officer Britt continued on Route 28, entering the parking lot from the opposite end. Now heading toward Jarrett's oncoming car, Officer Britt activated his lights. Jarrett did not stop. Rather, according to the testimony of Officers Britt and White, Jarrett and Officer Britt barely avoided colliding, and Officer Britt had to swerve abruptly. In contrast, Jarrett claimed that there was no near collision and that he never saw Officer Britt heading toward him. The parties agree, however, that Jarrett then continued into an adjoining parking lot where he hit a cement post. After hitting the post, Jarrett abandoned his car and fled, scaling a nearby fence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, there were two additional Yarmouth police officers in the vicinity: Officer Cheryl Nugent Gomsey and Officer Peter McClelland. Officer Gomsey had seen Jarrett driving quickly on Route 28, followed by the two officers in their marked patrol cars. She also saw Jarrett hit the post and run away. Officer McClelland had been attracted by radio communications made by Officers White and Britt, and he arrived shortly after Jarret had fled. In fact, Officer McClelland saw Jarrett hit the post and flee from a distance. One of the radio dispatches overheard by Officer McClelland was Officer White saying that he recognized the driver of the car, Jarrett, as a suspect in a prior armed robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Armed with only the information that Jarrett was wanted for several misdemeanor violations and had possibly been involved in a prior armed robbery, Officers McClelland and Gomsey undertook to track and apprehend Jarrett. Officer McClelland, the K-9 officer for the Yarmouth Police, also took his dog, Shadow, to assist in finding Jarrett. Shadow, after being helped over the fence, was placed on his usual 15-foot lead. He then began tracking Jarrett with Officer McClelland running closely behind. Officer Gomsey jogged after them, keeping some distance behind so as to not contaminate the track. The area through which Shadow led the officers was residential and the path circuitous. According to the testimony of Officer McClelland, after he had been running for slightly less than twenty minutes, he saw a man standing in the middle of the road, about fifty yards away. At this point, Officer Gomsey had fallen behind and could not see Officer McClelland, Shadow, or Jarrett. Officer McClelland testified that he shouted, three times, \"Stop, police or I'll send the dog.\" Officer Gomsey confirmed, in her testimony, that Officer McClelland issued several verbal warnings, which is \"normal [and] routine.\" After issuing these warnings, Officer McClelland testified that the suspect accelerated, disappearing around the corner. Only then, according to Officer McClelland, did he release Shadow with the directive to locate the suspect and hold him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shadow was trained under a \"bite and hold\" policy. This means that when he locates his target, Shadow will bite and maintain his hold until told to release. However, if the suspect struggles, the dog may lose his grip and rebite. This may cause the dog to bite several times, as it tries to maintain its hold. The uncontroverted evidence showed that \"bite and hold\" policies are the standard in the United States. An alternative, not widely adopted, is the \"circle and bark\" method. Under that training, a dog will circle his target, barking, until his handler arrives. If the target attempts to escape or begins to move, the dog will bite. Because Shadow was trained under the \"bite and hold\" method, Officer McClelland knew, when he released Shadow, that there was a high probability that the dog would bite the fleeing suspect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After being released, Shadow followed the man and disappeared around the corner. According to Officer McClelland, Shadow was only out of his sight for thirty seconds, and when he found Shadow, Shadow had apprehended Jarrett by biting him on the leg. Officer McClelland then testified that he commanded Shadow to release Jarrett, and Shadow did. After Shadow released, Officer McClelland handcuffed Jarrett and called for backup. An ambulance arrived within five minutes and transported Jarrett to the hospital where he received treatment, including several stitches, and was released.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, Jarrett recounted a slightly different version of events. He testified that he had just picked up his car, recently purchased, after finishing his shift at work. As he drove through Yarmouth, he claims to have not noticed the police officers who were following him. Instead, he was having problems with his brakes and pulled into the parking lot to try to slow down. While in the parking lot, shortly before hitting the cement pole, Jarrett noticed the police lights, but he did not see a police cruiser heading toward his car at any point. After hitting the post, Jarrett decided to run away.

Within five seconds, he heard someone yell, \"Stop.\" He apparently had fallen down at that point, and as he got back up, Jarrett heard someone say, \"Stop or I'll let the dog go.\" Jarrett testified that he then stopped, placing his hands in the air. Then, he felt a dog jump on his back. A command was issued, by an unseen person, in a foreign language, and the dog bit him on the leg, at least twice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the events of that evening, Jarrett was eventually charged with several misdemeanor offenses: (1) operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license; (2) leaving the scene of an accident; (3) operating an uninsured motor vehicle; and (4) failing to stop for a police officer. He was also charged with several civil infractions: (1) operating an unregistered motor vehicle; (2) failing to yield at an intersection; (3) speeding; and (4) operating a motor vehicle with defective equipment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jarrett originally filed his complaint in the District Court of Massachusetts alleging that Officer Peter McClelland used excessive force when he released Shadow, an \"instrument of potentially deadly force.\" Jarrett also sued the Chief of the Yarmouth Police, Robert Chapman, for tolerating a pattern and practice of excessive force by Officer McClelland.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After defendants' motion to dismiss on the grounds of qualified immunity was denied, the case proceeded to a bifurcated jury trial. In the first stage, the jury considered Jarrett's excessive force claim against Officer McClelland. They returned a verdict in favor of Jarrett, finding that Officer McClelland used excessive force. They awarded compensatory damages in the amount of one dollar and no punitive damages. Also, the jury, without being asked to do so, independently recommended that the Town of Yarmouth adopt a new standard for training its police dogs. Specifically, they recommended that \"the Town of Yarmouth be required from this time forward to .... retrain current K-9 units and train all future K-9 units to use the find and bark method.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury returned this verdict, defendants-appellants filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law arguing that both Officer McClelland and Chief Chapman are entitled to qualified immunity. The district court denied this motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial then proceeded to its second phase, against Chief Chapman.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> There, the jury found that Officer McClelland had acted in accordance with the Town's policy and procedures when he released Shadow. The jury also found that Chief Chapman had \"permitted and tolerated a pattern and practice of unjustified, unreasonable and excessive force by Officer Peter McClelland with respect to the latter's deployment of the dog, Shadow.\" After some confusion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the jury awarded $50,000 in punitive damages to Jarrett.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this second verdict, defendants-appellants filed another motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for a new trial, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b). In support, defendants-appellants argued that the evidence did not support either verdict and, in the alternative, that both defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. The district court denied the motion, and defendants-appellants filed their notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants-appellants raise multiple issues before this Court.

There are two possible theories that could support the verdict. First, the jury could have believed Jarrett's story that he had clearly surrendered before Officer McClelland ordered Shadow to bite. No one disputes that, if this occurred, it is a violation of Jarrett's Fourth Amendment rights and no qualified immunity defense can be made. <i>See Mendoza v. Block,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672914\"><a href=\"/opinion/672914/ronald-mendoza-v-sherman-block-los-angeles-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1357</span></a></span>, 1362 (9th Cir.1994) (\"[N]o particularized case law is necessary for a deputy to know that excessive force has been used when a deputy sics a canine on a handcuffed arrestee who has fully surrendered and is completely under control.\"). Second, the jury could have accepted appellants' version of events but found that Officer McClelland still acted unreasonably under the circumstances. Under this version, Officer McClelland released Shadow after issuing three verbal warnings and while Jarrett continued to flee. If this version is true, appellants argue that Officer McClelland is nevertheless protected by qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Normally, we would not have to resolve this dispute. We would just view the verdict in the light most favorable to Jarrett, the prevailing party, and uphold the result. <i>See Walton,</i> 272 F.3d at 18. Here, however, we must reconcile the verdict against Officer McClelland with the verdict against Chief Chapman, and the interpretation supported by Jarrett's testimony cannot be attuned with the jury's verdict in the second part of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After finding that Officer McClelland acted with excessive force, the same jury explicitly found that Officer McClelland acted in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Town of Yarmouth when he released Shadow. There is no evidence in the record that Yarmouth policies allow an officer to order a dog to attack a suspect who has already surrendered. In fact, the only evidence in the record is precisely to the contrary. The police regulations, introduced at trial, clearly stipulate that force may only be used in specific situations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Non-deadly force may be used by a police officer in the performance of his duty:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. when necessary to preserve the peace, prevent commission of offenses, or prevent suicide or self-inflicted injury; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. when necessary to overcome resistance to lawful arrests, searches and seizures, and to prevent escapes from custody; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. when in self-defense, or defense of another against unlawful violence to his person or property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No language in this regulation could possibly support a finding that it is the policy of the Yarmouth police to use <i>any</i> level of force against a suspect who has peacefully surrendered. No contrary regulations were introduced by plaintiff, and plaintiff did not argue that there was an unwritten policy of using force against such suspects. Therefore, no reasonable jury could have concluded both that Officer McClelland knew that Jarrett had surrendered when Shadow was released and that Officer McClelland acted in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Town of Yarmouth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Officer McClelland explicitly testified that he was required to announce, \"Stop, police or I'll release the dog,\" three times before releasing Shadow and that he did so before releasing Shadow to apprehend Jarrett. Officer Gomsey confirmed that it was \"routine\" to make such an announcement and that Officer McClelland had issued such a warning. The plaintiff introduced no evidence to suggest that Officer McClelland was not trained in such a way. In fact, plaintiff never contested that proper procedures required Officer McClelland to make this announcement. Therefore, because the jury found that Officer McClelland acted in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Town of Yarmouth, the jury must have also found that Officer McClelland verbally warned Jarrett before releasing Shadow. It is the only possible interpretation of the jury's finding, in light of the introduced evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the jury must have found that Officer McClelland did not know that Jarrett had surrendered and that Officer McClelland issued the required warnings before releasing Shadow, the jury must have found that the release of Shadow was still excessive force under the circumstances. In other words, the jury must have believed Officer McClelland's story but still found that the force he used was unreasonable in light of the circumstances. We must then consider whether this verdict can stand as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

We then turn to the second part of the qualified immunity inquiry: whether a reasonable officer would have believed that releasing a trained police dog to apprehend Jarrett was lawful in light of both clearly established law and the particular circumstances of that night. <i>See Wilson,</i> 526 U.S. at 609, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118289\"><a href=\"/opinion/118289/wilson-v-layne/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The issue is whether the use of police dogs to apprehend suspects by biting them constitutes deadly force.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> This is an important question because the Supreme Court has outlined specific rules governing the use of deadly force to seize suspects. <i>See Tennessee v.

In <i>Robinette v. Barnes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510266\"><a href=\"/opinion/510266/dorothy-robinette-administratrix-of-the-estate-of-daniel-briggs-deceased/\"><span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">909</span></a></span> (6th Cir.1988), the police, in the course of investigating a suspected burglary, released a dog into a building, believing that their suspect was inside. <i>Id.</i> at 911. The police issued several verbal warnings and then set the dog free, with the command, \"Find him.\" <i>Id.</i> When the dog found the suspect, the dog bit the suspect in the neck. <i>Id.</i> The victim quickly died from his wound. <i>Id.</i> The administratrix of the decedent's estate then brought suit under the Fourth Amendment and alleged the use of \"unnecessary deadly force.\" <i>Id.</i> Despite the fact that a death resulted, the Sixth Circuit held that \"the use of a properly trained police dog to apprehend a felony suspect does not carry with it a `substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily harm.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 912. <i>Robinette</i> thus established a baseline presumption that releases pursuant to general \"bite and hold\" policies are subject only to the rules governing the use of non-deadly force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequent cases have consistently followed this approach and held that the use of police dogs does not constitute deadly force. <i>See Vera Cruz v. City of Escondido,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></span> (9th Cir.1998) (holding that the plaintiff failed to present evidence that the use of a trained police dog presents more than a remote possibility of death and therefore plaintiff was not entitled to a deadly force instruction); <i>cf. Quintanilla v. City of Downey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718374\"><a href=\"/opinion/718374/96-cal-daily-op-serv-3597-96-daily-journal-dar-5821-ever-quintanilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1996) (holding that because the plaintiff suffered only non-life threatening injuries, did not require serious medical attention, and the dog released on command, he was not entitled to a deadly force instruction). Consequently, it is far from clearly established law that the use of trained police dogs to bite and detain suspects is deadly force, subject to the requirements of <i>Garner,</i> and no reasonable officer would have believed himself constrained by the rules governing the use of deadly force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This, however, does not completely answer the question of whether a reasonable officer in December of 1994 would have known that releasing a dog pursuant to a general \"bite and hold\" policy, like the Town of Yarmouth's policy, is unconstitutional. We note first that there is no case that has held these policies to be unconstitutional. Only one case, decided by a district court, could be read to suggest that acting pursuant to such policies raises constitutional problems of which a reasonable officer should be aware. In <i>Marley v. City of Allentown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1425820\"><a href=\"/opinion/1425820/marley-v-city-of-allentown/\"><span class=\"volume\">774</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

However, the court also relied upon the fact that evidence suggested that the suspect had visibly surrendered before the officer released the dog. <i>Id.</i> at 346. Therefore, it is hard to accord any particular significance to the decision in <i>Marley</i> because everyone agrees that siccing a dog upon a compliant suspect is a clear constitutional violation. <i>Mendoza,</i> 27 F.3d at 1362.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, other courts have concluded that \"bite and hold\" policies are not contrary to clearly established law. In <i>Watkins v. City of Oakland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754797\"><a href=\"/opinion/754797/98-cal-daily-op-serv-4057-98-daily-journal-dar-5623-nathaniel/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1087</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1998), the Ninth Circuit addressed an incident which occurred on November 20, 1993, slightly more than one year before the event of which Jarrett complains. There, the court determined that a \"`bite and hold' policy did not violate clearly established law concerning the use of excessive force.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1092. Additionally, an officer acting in accordance with that policy would be entitled to qualified immunity. <i>Id.</i> In reaching this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit found that <i>Marley</i> failed to provide \"sufficient notice\" that acting under typical \"bite and hold\" policies could be unconstitutional. <i>Id.</i> at 1092 n. 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than finding releases pursuant to \"bite and hold\" policies to be constitutionally questionable, courts have principally worried about releases that did not comport with those policies. For example, in <i>Watkins,</i> the court denied summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity because the plaintiff testified that the officer had allowed the dog to continue biting even after the plaintiff was fully compliant and no longer posed a threat. <i>Id.</i> at 1093. In <i>Vathekan v. Prince George's County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757573\"><a href=\"/opinion/757573/esther-vathekan-v-prince-georges-county-maryland-jeffrey-j-simms-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span> (4th Cir.1998), the Fourth Circuit concentrated on the issue of notice. <i>Id.</i> at 179. That case dealt with a truly horrific scenario where the police had released a dog into an occupied home, reasonably believing that a burglar might be lurking inside. <i>Id.</i> at 176. Instead of finding a burglar, the dog attacked the lawful resident who was asleep in her bed, crushing her skull. <i>Id.</i> at 177. The court denied summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity because it found that there was a genuine issue as to whether the officers had issued a verbal warning before releasing the dog. <i>Id.</i> at 180-81. Furthermore, the court held that, as of 1995, it was objectively unreasonable to release a police dog without first giving a verbal warning. <i>Id.</i> at 179. This decision, however, suggests that a release that follows a verbal warning would raise no constitutional problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, however, one way in which the instant case differs from <i>Robinette, Watkins,</i> and <i>Vathekan</i> and instead resembles <i>Marley:</i> Jarrett was only suspected of having committed misdemeanors and traffic violations, not any felonies. <i>Marley</i> certainly suggests that using a police dog to apprehend a \"fleeing misdemeanant\" is objectively unreasonable and, hence, unconstitutional. 774 F.Supp. at 345-46; <i>cf. Mendoza v. Block,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672914\"><a href=\"/opinion/672914/ronald-mendoza-v-sherman-block-los-angeles-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1357</span></a></span>, 1362-63 (9th Cir.1994) (emphasizing both the fact that the dog bite victim was wanted for a bank robbery, a felony, and the additional facts that the suspect was possibly armed and hiding on private property when holding that the officer acted in an objectively reasonable manner when he released his dog).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Furthermore, the Supreme Court has explicitly directed the courts to consider the severity of the crimes involved when evaluating excessive force claims. <i>Graham,</i> 490 U.S. at 396, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1865</span></a></span>. Courts are supposed to look to \"the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\" <i>Id.; accord Gaudreault v. Municipality of Salem,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554019\"><a href=\"/opinion/554019/robert-a-gaudreault-v-municipality-of-salem-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span>, 205 (1st Cir.1990) (per curiam). Therefore, it is clearly established law, and was so in December of 1994, that officers should consider the type of crime for which a suspect is wanted when deciding what level of force is appropriate. This, however, is hardly determinative. <i>Graham</i> and other cases make clear that the severity of the crime at issue is not the only fact of importance, rather it is to be weighed in light of other surrounding circumstances. <i>See, e.g., Graham,</i> 490 U.S. at 396, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678528\"><a href=\"/opinion/678528/scott-l-matthews-v-leon-e-jones-sr-jefferson-county-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1046</span></a></span> (6th Cir.1994). The facts of that case were actually very similar to the case at bar. In <i>Matthews,</i> a police officer attempted to stop a driver who was speeding and driving erratically. <i>Id.</i> at 1048. A car chase ensued which ended when the driver pulled into some woods and fled on foot. <i>Id.</i> Shortly thereafter, a K-9 unit arrived on the scene and began to track the fleeing driver. <i>Id.</i> The dog eventually signaled that he had found the target but did not bite. <i>Id.</i> The officers then ordered the driver to stay still. <i>Id.</i> The driver did not comply, and the dog bit him. <i>Id.</i> Based on these facts, the Sixth Circuit concluded that \"there is no evidence whatever in this record which could support a claim that [the dog] was not used in an `appropriate manner.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 1051 (citing <i>Robinette,</i> 854 F.2d at 913). Therefore, the court concluded \"that no reasonable jury could conclude that the use of the police dog to apprehend Matthews was not objectively reasonable.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1052.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Officer McClelland knew that he was chasing Jarrett, who was wanted for several misdemeanor and traffic violations. This, however, was not all. Officer McClelland had overheard Officer White say that Jarrett had been a suspect in a prior armed robbery. Jarrett had fled from a seemingly inconsequential accident, a suspicious reaction. Furthermore, Jarrett was fleeing through a residential neighborhood in the middle of the night. It was difficult to see, and Officer McClelland had no way of knowing whether Jarrett was armed or not. Under these circumstances, taking into account the disposition of prior cases, it was not clearly established that releasing Shadow would be excessive force. In fact, the situation was very similar to that addressed in <i>Matthews</i> where the Fourth Circuit held that releasing the dog was objectively reasonable. <i>Id.</i> Therefore, Officer McClelland is properly entitled to qualified immunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Qualified Immunity for Chief Chapman</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chief Chapman also raised the affirmative defense of qualified immunity before the district court and reasserts that defense before us. Like individual officers, supervisors can also avail themselves of the protections of qualified immunity. <i>Camilo-Robles,</i> 151 F.3d at 5-6. In order for a supervisor to be held liable for the actions of a subordinate under &#167; 1983, two conditions must be fulfilled: (1) the subordinate must have committed a constitutional violation, and (2) \"it was clearly established that a supervisor would be liable for constitutional violations perpetrated by his subordinates in that context.\" <i>Id.</i> at 6. Again, we assume, <i>arguendo,</i> that Officer McClelland violated Jarrett's Fourth Amendment rights. Therefore, Chief Chapman can be held liable if his actions predictably led to Officer McClelland's use of excessive force, either by creating a policy or being deliberately indifferent to possible constitutional violations by his subordinates. <i>Id.</i> at 6-7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed above, in December 1994, it was not clearly established that apprehension of suspects pursuant to \"bite and hold\" policies created constitutional problems. <i>See Watkins,</i> 145 F.3d at 1091. In fact, the Ninth Circuit had specifically held that, as of 1993, a chief of police was entitled to qualified immunity because there was no clearly established law against \"bite and hold\" policies. <i>Id.</i> at 1094 n. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ninth Circuit, a frequent arbiter of excessive force cases involving dog bites, has recognized that \"bite and hold\" is \"neither a new nor a unique policy.\" <i>Chew,</i> 27 F.3d at 1447. In fact, training dogs in accordance with this policy is \"long-standing, widespread, and well-known.\" <i>Id.</i> This decision, issued a mere four months prior to the night in question, found that Los Angeles' \"bite and hold\" policy did not violate the clearly established laws regarding both the training and deployment of police dogs. <i>Id.</i> at 1448. The court continued to find:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]e simply do not believe that, given the historical facts and circumstances, the use of police dogs in the manner prescribed in the Los Angeles Police Department's policy is sufficiently similar to other uses of force held to be unconstitutional by the courts to put reasonable law enforcement officials on notice that the department's policy violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1450. The court relied upon that finding to conclude that the officers responsible for promulgating the \"bite and hold\" policy were entitled to qualified immunity. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This, however, is only half of the <i>Chew</i> court's decision. The Ninth Circuit also reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the city and allowed the plaintiff to pursue his claim that the \"bite and hold\" policy, itself, was unconstitutional. <i>Id.</i> at 1439-40. The city, which cannot invoke the protections of qualified immunity, prevailed below by convincing the district court that this particular dog release was objectively reasonable. <i>Id.</i> at 1439. The Ninth Circuit concluded that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the officer actually acted in accordance with city policy. <i>Id.</i> at 1440. While this theory does not implicate the general constitutionality of the policy, the court specifically allowed the plaintiff to proceed on the alternate theory that the policy was unconstitutional. <i>Id.</i> This decision, then, establishes that \"bite and hold\" policies are open to constitutional challenges. It does not, however, establish that they are unconstitutional. <i>Id.</i> at 1451.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While <i>Chew</i> allowed a constitutional challenge to a \"bite and hold\" policy to proceed, it can hardly be considered a clear statement alerting police supervisors that their \"bite and hold\" policies are unconstitutional. In fact, the <i>Chew</i> decision hardly changed the legal landscape; it just allowed a challenge to proceed. Additionally, the evidence presented in the case at bar only supports the conclusion that such policies continue to be the norm across the country. Therefore, we hold, that as of December 1994, the law was not clearly established that a supervisor could be held liable for the actions of an officer acting pursuant to a \"bite and hold\" policy and that as a result such a supervisor is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This, however, does not determine the question as to Chief Chapman because Jarrett also alleged that the chief had failed to adequately train and supervise Officer McClelland. While a supervisor may indeed be held liable for failure to adequately train or supervise, <i>see, e.g., Aponte Matos,</i> 135 F.3d at 192 (noting that a supervisor may be held liable for failure to discipline a \"miscreant officer\"), Jarrett's failure to train argument essentially boils down to a complaint with the \"bite and hold\" policy in Yarmouth. He does not allege that Officer McClelland was improperly trained under this policy. In fact, all the evidence supports the conclusion that Officer McClelland was exceptionally well-trained. The uncontradicted testimony was that Officer McClelland and Shadow were one of the highest-rated K-9 teams in the nation. They had even been recognized internationally. Rather than attacking the substantial training that Officer McClelland and Shadow received, Jarrett essentially alleges that Chief Chapman was deliberately indifferent because he allowed the \"bite and hold\" policy in Yarmouth to stand. This argument is no different than claiming that Chief Chapman is liable because he promulgated a \"bite and hold\" policy, and, as such, Chief Chapman is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

A colloquy that occurred before phase two began possibly led plaintiff to believe that the Town had been reinstated as a defendant, although it could only be subject to a possible attorney's fees award. In fact, the only relief sought in the second phase was punitive damages, and all the parties recognize that the Town is immune from such damages<i>See City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110553\"><a href=\"/opinion/110553/newport-v-fact-concerts-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110553\"><a href=\"/opinion/110553/newport-v-fact-concerts-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

At various points in the record, the court and the defendants specify that only Chief Chapman is a defendant during phase two because of the Town's immunity. Only the plaintiff tries to insert references to the Town as a defendant, although never specifying the relief sought from the Town.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">This possible confusion, however, is not enough to actually make the Town a defendant. The record is clear that the Town was never identified, by the court, as a defendant. The jury instructions contain no reference to the Town as a defendant, and the verdict form specifies that Chief Chapman is the defendant without making any similar assertion about the Town. In regard to Chief Chapman, the verdict form asks:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Has the plaintiff proved by a preponderance of the evidence that <i>the defendant, Robert Chapman, as Chief of the Yarmouth Police department,</i> permitted and tolerated a pattern and practice of unjustified, unreasonable and excessive force by Officer Peter McClelland with respect to the latter's deployment of the dog, Shadow?</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added). In marked contrast, the verdict form does not identify the Town as a defendant; it simply asks if Officer McClelland acted \"in accordance with the Town of Yarmouth [sic] policy and procedure.\" Because neither the jury instructions nor the verdict form asked the jury to judge the Town's liability or award any damages against it, the Town cannot be considered a defendant. Jarrett did not object to these instructions and, thus, lost any right to complain. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 (establishing that failure to object to a jury instruction waives the right to appeal any error). Furthermore, these questions were placed before the jury not only without objection from plaintiff but at his behest.

That case, however, dealt with three apprehensions where the officers had ordered their dogs to bite suspects without allowing the suspects to first surrender or after the suspects had actually surrendered. <i>Id.</i> at 1551-52. This is conduct that everyone agrees constitutes excessive force, whether the suspect is wanted for a felony or a misdemeanor.
