Gibson, of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\f             JOHN R. GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge.           Natalja Sersnova,\n\na noncitizen resident of Latvia, seeks review of a final order of\n\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals denying her application for asylum\n\nand withholding of removal.      We deny review.\n\n             Sersnova contends that she has a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution in Latvia on account of her Russian ethnicity.\n\nShe testified that she was born in the Ukraine of a Ukrainian\n\nmother and a Russian father, but that she grew up in Latvia in an\n\narea populated mostly by ethnic Russians.         Her early schooling was\n\nconducted in Russian, although she studied Latvian and took Latvian\n\nlanguage exams in 1997 and 1999, testing at the average level.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1998, she was admitted to the\n\nLatvian University of Agriculture, where the instruction was in\n\nLatvian.     She performed well there.       She worked as a census taker\n\nin Latvia.    Her parents and her brother continue to live in Latvia,\n\nwhere her father and brother are both employed.             Neither Sersnova\n\nnor her brother has ever been arrested in Latvia.\n\n             Sersnova testified that she never had applied for Latvian\n\ncitizenship because she had not achieved the highest level on the\n\nLatvian language tests, which she said was a pre-requisite for\n\ncitizenship.       Sersnova apparently did not retake the Latvian exam\n\nin 2000 after she finished two years of university level coursework\n\nconducted in Latvian.\n\n             She    testified   that   she     had   been     subjected    to\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fdiscrimination on the basis of her Russian ethnicity when people\n\ncursed at her on the street, threw rocks and bottles at the\n\nbuilding where she lived, and refused to come to the door when she\n\nwas working as a census taker.   She said that her math teacher at\n\nthe university had been hostile to her and refused to help her\n\nbecause she was Russian.   She also said that one of her friends had\n\nbeen hit in the head with a bottle thrown from a bus because the\n\nfriend had been speaking Russian.\n\n          Sersnova offered into evidence the State Department's\n\n2002 Country Report on Latvia, which indicated that the Latvian\n\nlanguage requirement for citizenship has been liberalized so that\n\na high school language certificate now suffices.    The same report\n\nindicated that the government has facilitated the naturalization\n\nprocess so that 95% of applicants now pass the exams on the first\n\ntry.\n\n          The IJ found that none of the incidents recounted by\n\nSersnova \"come close\" to establishing past persecution and that she\n\ndid not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution.    The\n\nIJ therefore denied her application for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and relief under the Convention Against Torture.   He held\n\nthat she could be removed to Latvia, and if Latvia would not accept\n\nher, she could be removed to Ukraine.\n\n          Sersnova appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals.\n\nHer brief to the BIA included a request to the BIA to receive new\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fevidentiary materials not a part of the record before the IJ.                    The\n\nBIA summarily affirmed the IJ’s order without mentioning Sersnova’s\n\nrequest to receive the new evidence.\n\n            On petition for review of the BIA’s summary affirmance,\n\nwe review the IJ’s decision as if it were the decision of the BIA.\n\nOlujoke v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2005).                    We review\n\nthe IJ’s findings of fact for substantial evidence, upholding them\n\nunless the record evidence would compel any reasonable factfinder\n\nto make a contrary determination.            Id.\n\n            The IJ’s findings that Sersnova has not suffered past\n\npersecution or shown a well-founded fear of future persecution are\n\nwell   supported   by   the   record.    Sersnova’s         description    of    her\n\npersonal    experiences   does   not    show       either   that   she   has    been\n\nsubjected to treatment severe enough to constitute persecution or\n\nthat she has reason       to fear she would be subjected to such\n\ntreatment if she returned to Latvia.                At most, she described a\n\n\"general climate of discrimination,\" which does not suffice to\n\nestablish persecution. See Attia v. Gonzales, 477 F.3d 21, 23-24\n\n(1st Cir. 2007)(per curiam).      Her testimony that she would not be\n\nable to pass the Latvian language requirements for citizenship\n\nafter having completed two years of college-level studies conducted\n\nin Latvian was contrary to the evidence in the State Department\n\ncountry report that she introduced.                We easily uphold the IJ's\n\nfindings.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f          Sersnova also contends that the BIA erred in issuing its\n\nsummary affirmance without noting specifically that it denied the\n\n\"motion to expand record\" included in her BIA appeal brief.       The\n\nBIA does not find facts in the course of deciding appeals, except\n\n\"for taking administrative notice of commonly known facts.\"        8\n\nC.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv).     The BIA therefore need not consider\n\nevidence presented for the first time on administrative appeal.\n\nBhanot v. Chertoff, 474 F.3d 71, 74 (2d Cir. 2007)(per curiam).   \"A\n\nparty asserting that the Board cannot properly resolve an appeal\n\nwithout further factfinding must file a motion for remand.\"        8\n\nC.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv).     Sersnova did not file such a motion,\n\nand therefore the BIA was not obliged to remand.     Ye v. Dep't of\n\nHomeland Security, 446 F.3d 289, 296 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\n          Although the BIA arguably erred by not mentioning the\n\nrequest to expand the record in its summary affirmance, we conclude\n\nremand would be futile because the additional documents offered\n\nwould not change the result.    See Bhanot, 474 F.3d at 74; see also\n\nHussain v. Gonzales, 477 F.3d 153, 158 (4th Cir. 2007); see\n\ngenerally NLRB v. Wyman-Gordon Co., 394 U.S. 759, 766 n.6 (1969)\n\n(SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80 (1943), does not require remand\n\nwhere it would be \"an idle and useless formality.\").        Sersnova\n\ncould have received a remand or reopening only if she had    shown a\n\nprima facie case that she was eligible for the relief sought and if\n\nthe evidence she sought to introduce was material and unavailable\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fduring the earlier proceedings. Falae v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 11, 14\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).   Dates on three of the documents Sersnova offered\n\nshow they were publicly available in November 2003 during the\n\nhearing before the IJ, and a fourth is undated, but contains no\n\ninformation about events later than 1998.     The other news articles\n\nsubmitted have to do with protests over proposed measures such as\n\nlimiting the amount of school instruction conducted in the Russian\n\nlanguage, which does not threaten Sersnova personally since she\n\nsuccessfully   performed   university   studies   with   instruction   in\n\nLatvian.   The 2003 State Department country report was consistent\n\nwith the 2002 report before the IJ, except that the 2003 Report\n\nshows that an additional 10,403 non-citizens were naturalized\n\nduring the intervening year, which of course undermines Sersnova's\n\nclaim that she would not be able to become a citizen.        Because it\n\nis evident that the documents attached to Sersnova's BIA brief\n\nwould not have been a basis for reopening her case, we decline to\n\norder a futile remand.\n\n           We deny review.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",
