José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                       Lipez, Hansen,* and Howard,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Rafael F. Castro Lang for appellant.\n     German A. Rieckehoff, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Rosa E. Rodriguez Velez, United States Attorney and Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate\nDivision, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             June 19, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f          Per Curiam. Defendant-appellant Felix Gonzalez-Melendez\n\nwas indicted on one count of aiding and abetting a carjacking, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2119(1) and (2), and one count of using a\n\nfirearm during and in relation to a carjacking (which is a crime of\n\nviolence), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).   After trial, a jury\n\nconvicted Gonzalez-Melendez of the carjacking charge, but acquitted\n\nhim of the firearms charge.\n\n          On appeal, Gonzalez-Melendez alleges several infirmities\n\nin the proceedings below, including a deficiency in the district\n\ncourt’s handling of his discovery request for certain prior out-of-\n\ncourt statements made by Lawrence Evans, the general manager of\n\nEssroc San Juan, who was the supervisor of both the victim of the\n\ncarjacking and the appellant.    The government concedes that the\n\ndistrict court did not comply with its obligation independently to\n\nreview the government's compliance with the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3500, as required by circuit precedent.   Accordingly, we remand\n\nthis case to the district court for limited proceedings consistent\n\nwith this order, while retaining jurisdiction over the appeal.\n\n          In addition, appellant argues that the record does not\n\nreflect any indication of how the district court handled the jury's\n\nfirst (2:15 pm) note requesting copies of the indictment and the\n\ncourt's instructions of law, as well as an explanation of an\n\nunspecified issue from the district court.       A district court's\n\nfailure to attempt to inform defense counsel about the existence of\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fa jury note, and further failure to solicit defense counsel's input\n\nregarding any response to such a note, violates Rule 43 of the\n\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure.         See United States v. Ofray-\n\nCampos, 534 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 2008) cert denied, 129 S. Ct. 588\n\n(2009) (citing Fed R. Crim. P. 43(a)(2)).           Because the Jencks Act\n\nchallenge requires a remand in any event, we invite the district\n\ncourt to augment the record with additional details about its\n\nhandling of the first jury note, including whether it attempted to\n\nappraise counsel of the note's existence, if so, whether and how\n\nquickly    counsel   responded,   and    finally,   the   court's    ultimate\n\nresponse, if any, to the note.      If necessary, we will address the\n\nappellant’s   remaining   claims   after    district      court   proceedings\n\npursuant to this limited remand have been concluded.\n\n            Because we deal with such a small portion of this case,\n\nwe provide only a background of the events that gave rise to the\n\nJencks Act challenge and the issue concerning the jury note.\n\nImmediately after Evans completed his testimony on direct appeal,\n\nthe defense requested discovery of any prior statements made by\n\nEvans relating to the subject matter of his testimony that were in\n\nthe government’s possession.            See 18 U.S.C. § 3500(a).         The\n\ngovernment had in its possession an FD-302 Form, which is a an FBI\n\nform that reports on and summarizes an FBI agent’s interview of a\n\nwitness.    See United States v. Skilling, 554 F.3d 529, 577-78 (5th\n\nCir. 2009) (describing these Forms and noting that the government\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fdisclosed them in that case).                 The government, however, claimed\n\nthat this Form was not discoverable because the witness never\n\nadopted the Form, and therefore the contents of the Form did not\n\nconstitute a \"statement\" of the witness within the meaning of the\n\nJencks Act.             18 U.S.C. § 3500(e)(1) (defining statement of a\n\nwitness      to     include   a    “written     statement”    that   is    “signed   or\n\notherwise adopted” by the witness).                    Over the objections of the\n\ndefendant, the district court denied discovery of the FD-302 Form\n\non this basis.\n\n                  We fast-forward past the rest of the trial (and the\n\nalleged errors that occurred therein) and resume with the jury's\n\ndeliberations. Shortly after the jury began its deliberations, the\n\njury       sent    an   unsigned    note   to    the    district   judge   that   said\n\n\"[p]lease send a copy of the indictments and the instructions of\n\nlaw.       Please explain.        Thanks a lot.\"       This note was duly marked as\n\njury note number one and docketed.                But neither the docket nor the\n\nrecord reveals any indication of what if anything the district\n\ncourt did in response to the jury note.                   Indeed, the copy of the\n\nnote in the district court docket is the only reference to the note\n\nin the record.1\n\n                  On appeal, the appellant argues that the district court’s\n\nJencks Act ruling was in error, and the government agrees.                           See\n\n\n       1\n      The district court received two other notes from the jury on\nthe same day, and neither party challenges the district court's\nhandling of these notes.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fG’vt. Br. at 34-36.     Where a defendant requests discovery of\n\npotential Jencks material, our precedent requires the district\n\njudge to conduct an independent investigation of any such materials\n\nand determine whether these materials are discoverable under the\n\nJencks Act.2   In this case, because the substance of the Form 302\n\nwas relevant to the witness’s testimony, the district court should\n\nhave determined whether the Form 302 was producible under the\n\nJencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500(e).3     E.g., United States v. Rosario-\n\nPeralta, 175 F.3d 48, 55 (1st Cir. 1999) (explaining procedure with\n\nrespect to subsection(e)(1)); United States v. Neal, 36 F.3d 1190,\n\n1197-98 (1st Cir. 1994) (explaining procedure with respect to\n\nsubsection (e)(2)).\n\n          Because the Jencks Act contains several definitions of\n\n\"statement,\" the district court was obliged (and on remand, is\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      This independent review may include such measures as in\ncamera inspection of any disputed document(s), and conducting a\nhearing to evaluate extrinsic evidence, including taking the\ntestimony of the witness whose potential \"statements\" are at issue\nas well as the person who prepared the written document in which\nthose statements appear. See generally Goldberg v. United States,\n425 U.S. 94, 108-09 (1976).\n     3\n      In this case, the document would have been producible if it\nwas a \"statement\" made by Evans. A \"statement\" within the meaning\nof the Jencks Act is (1) a written statement made, adopted, or\napproved by the witness, 18 U.S.C. § 3500(e)(1); (2) a recording\n(or transcription thereof) that is a substantially verbatim recital\nof an oral statement made by the witness and recorded\ncontemporaneously with the making of the oral statement, id. at §\n(e)(2); or (3) a statement (or transcription thereof) made by the\nwitness to a grand jury, id. at § (e)(3).\n\n                                -5-\n\fobliged) independently to determine whether the Form 302 meets any\n\nof the Jencks Act's definitions of \"statement.\"\n\n          With respect to a written statement of a witness, see 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3500(e)(1), it is sufficient but not necessary that the\n\nsupposed \"statement\" be signed by the witness or consist of a\n\nsubstantially   verbatim   recording   of   a   prior   oral   statement.\n\nCampbell v. United States, 373 U.S. 487, 492 n.6 (1963). Moreover,\n\nit is equally clear that the witness need not write the statement\n\nhimself. Id. Furthermore, a witness may orally adopt a statement,\n\neven if he has reviewed the statement only aurally.       See generally\n\nid. at 489-91 (finding that copies of notes federal agent took\n\nduring witness interview, the accuracy of which the agent confirmed\n\nby reading them back to witness who agreed notes were accurate, was\n\na statement adopted by the witness for Jencks Act purposes); United\n\nStates v. Colon-Diaz, 521 F.3d 29, 38-40 (1st Cir. 2008). Finally,\n\nany materials substantially equivalent to a \"statement\" that the\n\nwitness has orally adopted can themselves be considered materials\n\n\"adopted\" by the witness for purposes of the Jencks Act. Campbell,\n\n373 U.S. at 495-96 (concluding that interview report prepared from\n\ninterview notes adopted by witness was reasonably found to be an\n\naccurate \"copy\" of witness's orally adopted statement); see also\n\nColon-Diaz, 521 F.3d at 38-40 (noting that government disclosed\n\nDEA-6 reports that witness adopted orally).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f           Of course, there may be other scenarios in which an\n\nunsigned   document   is    nevertheless    adopted    and    is    therefore\n\ndisclosable under the Jencks Act.        On remand, the parties and the\n\ndistrict court will have the opportunity to explore this matter\n\nfurther.\n\n           In addition, although it was not considered at length\n\nbelow, the district court on remand should consider whether this\n\nparticular Form 302 is a \"substantially verbatim recital of an oral\n\nstatement\" made by a witness and recorded contemporaneously.               18\n\nU.S.C. § 3500(e)(2).       As we have long held, a longhand writing,\n\nwhich \"fairly follow[s] a witness'[s] words, subject to minor,\n\ninconsequential errors\" is discoverable under § (e)(2) of the\n\nJencks Act.   Neal, 36 F.3d at 1198 (citations omitted).\n\n           Thus,   consistent    with     Supreme     Court   and     circuit\n\nprecedent, we remand this case to the district court for the\n\nlimited purpose of revisiting its Jencks Act ruling in light of the\n\nproper legal standards.      The district court should independently\n\nsatisfy itself whether or not the Form 302 reflecting an FBI\n\ninterview with Evans was discoverable under the Jencks Act.               In\n\nthat endeavor, we note that it would be difficult to complete the\n\ntask without reviewing the document itself and that it likely would\n\nbe helpful to hear from not only Mr. Evans, but also the agent(s)\n\nwho interviewed him and the agent who prepared the Form.                 See\n\nCampbell, 373 U.S. at 490-91.\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f            If, after applying the legal standards articulated here,\n\nthe district court concludes that the Form is not discoverable, it\n\nshould   \"supplement   the   record    with   findings\"      supporting   this\n\ndecision.   Goldberg, 425 U.S. at 111; Rosario-Peralta, 175 F.3d at\n\n57-58; Neal, 36 F.3d at 1199.         If, however, the court finds that\n\nthere was a Jencks Act violation, it must further consider whether\n\nthe government's failure to disclose these materials was harmless.\n\nSee, e.g., Goldberg, 425 U.S. at 111-12 (\"On the other hand, if the\n\ncourt concludes that the Government should have been required to\n\ndeliver the material, or part of it, to petitioner, and that the\n\nerror was not harmless, the District Court will vacate the judgment\n\nof conviction and accord petitioner a new trial.\") (footnote\n\nomitted); Erkman v. United States, 416 U.S. 909, 913 (1974); United\n\nStates v. Lucas, 516 F.3d 316, 347 & n.120 (5th Cir. 2008) (citing\n\nUnited States v. Ramirez, 174 F.3d 584, 587 (5th Cir. 1999));\n\nUnited States v. Oruche, 484 F.3d 590, 597 (D.C. Cir. 2007)\n\n(citation omitted); Neal, 36 F.3d at 1199.                Should the court\n\nconclude that the failure to disclose was harmless, it should\n\nsupplement the record with an explanation of why the nondisclosure\n\nwas harmless and why a new trial is not appropriate.           Neal, 36 F.3d\n\nat 1199.     In this regard, we note that \"[s]ince courts cannot\n\nspeculate    whether   Jencks   material      could   have    been   utilized\n\neffectively at trial, the harmless-error doctrine must be strictly\n\napplied in Jencks Act cases.\"          Goldberg, 425 U.S. at 111 n.21\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f(internal quotation marks and citations omitted); Erkman, 416 U.S.\n\nat 909 (\"harmless error doctrine should be employed with restraint\n\nin Jencks Act cases\").\n\n          Thus, we remand to the district court to conduct further\n\nproceedings to determine whether the Form 302 was discoverable\n\nunder the Jencks Act, and if so, whether a new trial should be\n\ngranted. In addition, on remand, the district court should explain\n\nwhat action, if any, it took in response to the first jury note\n\nreceived at 2:15 pm.      In particular, it would be helpful for the\n\ncourt to explain whether the court attempted to apprise counsel of\n\nthe note, if so, whether and how quickly counsel responded, and how\n\nthe court ultimately handled the note, including whether any\n\ndocuments were provided to the jury, and whether the court provided\n\nthe jury with any other written or oral instructions.\n\n          We retain jurisdiction over this appeal, and will resume\n\nconsideration of the remaining issues in this appeal, including any\n\nchallenges   to     the   district   court's   revised   Jencks   Act\n\ndeterminations, and/or the court's handling of the jury note after\n\nthe proceedings on remand have concluded.\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f",

Rodriguez Velez, United States Attorney and Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate Division, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LIPEZ, HANSEN,<sup>[*]</sup> and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>Defendant-appellant Felix Gonzalez-Melendez was indicted on one count of aiding and abetting a carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2119(1) and (2), and one count of using a firearm during and in relation to a carjacking (which is a crime of violence), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). After trial, a jury convicted Gonzalez-Melendez of the carjacking charge, but acquitted him of the firearms charge.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Gonzalez-Melendez alleges several infirmities in the proceedings below, including a deficiency in the district court's handling of his discovery request for certain prior out-of-court statements made by Lawrence Evans, the general manager of Essroc San Juan, who was the supervisor of both the victim of the carjacking and the appellant. The government concedes that the district court did not comply with its obligation independently to review the government's compliance with the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500, as required by circuit precedent. Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court for limited proceedings consistent with this order, while retaining jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>\n<p>In addition, appellant argues that the record does not reflect any indication of how the district court handled the jury's first (2:15 pm) note requesting copies of the indictment and the court's instructions of law, as well as an explanation of an unspecified issue from the district court. A district court's failure to attempt to inform defense counsel about the existence of a jury note, and further failure to solicit defense counsel's input regarding any response to such a note, violates Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ofray-Campos,</i> 534 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir.2008) <i>cert denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 588, 172 L.Ed.2d 444 (2008) (<i>citing</i> Fed R.Crim. P. 43(a)(2)). Because the Jencks Act challenge requires a remand in any event, we invite the district court to augment the record with additional details about its handling of the first jury note, including whether it attempted to appraise counsel of the note's existence, if so, whether and how quickly counsel responded, and finally, the court's ultimate response, if any, to the note. If necessary, we will address the appellant's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> remaining claims after district court proceedings pursuant to this limited remand have been concluded.</p>\n<p>Because we deal with such a small portion of this case, we provide only a background of the events that gave rise to the Jencks Act challenge and the issue concerning the jury note. Immediately after Evans completed his testimony on direct appeal, the defense requested discovery of any prior statements made by Evans relating to the subject matter of his testimony that were in the government's possession. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3500(a). The government had in its possession an FD-302 Form, which is a an FBI form that reports on and summarizes an FBI agent's interview of a witness. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Skilling,</i> 554 F.3d 529, 577-78 (5th Cir.2009) (describing these Forms and noting that the government disclosed them in that case). The government, however, claimed that this Form was not discoverable because the witness never adopted the Form, and therefore the contents of the Form did not constitute a \"statement\" of the witness within the meaning of the Jencks Act. 18 U.S.C. § 3500(e)(1) (defining statement of a witness to include a \"written statement\" that is \"signed or otherwise adopted\" by the witness). Over the objections of the defendant, the district court denied discovery of the FD-302 Form on this basis.</p>\n<p>We fast-forward past the rest of the trial (and the alleged errors that occurred therein) and resume with the jury's deliberations. Shortly after the jury began its deliberations, the jury sent an unsigned note to the district judge that said \"[p]lease send a copy of the indictments and the instructions of law. Please explain. Thanks a lot.\" This note was duly marked as jury note number one and docketed. But neither the docket nor the record reveals any indication of what if anything the district court did in response to the jury note.

In that endeavor, we note that it would be difficult to complete the task without reviewing the document itself and that it likely would be helpful to hear from not only Mr. Evans, but also the agent(s) who interviewed him and the agent who prepared the Form. <i>See </i><i>Campbell,</i> 373 U.S. at 490-91, 83 S.Ct. 1356.</p>\n<p>If, after applying the legal standards articulated here, the district court concludes that the Form is not discoverable, it should \"supplement the record with findings\" supporting this decision. <i>Goldberg,</i> 425 U.S. at 111, 96 S.Ct. 1338; <i>Rosario-Peralta,</i> 175 F.3d at 57; <i>Neal,</i> 36 F.3d at 1199. If, however, the court finds that there was a Jencks Act violation, it must further consider whether the government's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> failure to disclose these materials was harmless. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Goldberg,</i> 425 U.S. at 111-12, 96 S.Ct. 1338 (\"On the other hand, if the court concludes that the Government should have been required to deliver the material, or part of it, to petitioner, and that the error was not harmless, the District Court will vacate the judgment of conviction and accord petitioner a new trial.\") (footnote omitted); <i>Erckman v.

Rodriguez Velez, United States Attorney and Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate Division, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LIPEZ, HANSEN,<sup>[*]</sup> and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>Defendant-appellant Felix Gonzalez-Melendez was indicted on one count of aiding and abetting a carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2119(1) and (2), and one count of using a firearm during and in relation to a carjacking (which is a crime of violence), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). After trial, a jury convicted Gonzalez-Melendez of the carjacking charge, but acquitted him of the firearms charge.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Gonzalez-Melendez alleges several infirmities in the proceedings below, including a deficiency in the district court's handling of his discovery request for certain prior out-of-court statements made by Lawrence Evans, the general manager of Essroc San Juan, who was the supervisor of both the victim of the carjacking and the appellant. The government concedes that the district court did not comply with its obligation independently to review the government's compliance with the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500, as required by circuit precedent. Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court for limited proceedings consistent with this order, while retaining jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>\n<p>In addition, appellant argues that the record does not reflect any indication of how the district court handled the jury's first (2:15 pm) note requesting copies of the indictment and the court's instructions of law, as well as an explanation of an unspecified issue from the district court. A district court's failure to attempt to inform defense counsel about the existence of a jury note, and further failure to solicit defense counsel's input regarding any response to such a note, violates Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ofray-Campos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203367\"><a href=\"/opinion/203367/united-states-v-ofray-campos/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2008) <i>cert denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></span> (2008) (<i>citing</i> Fed R.Crim. P. 43(a)(2)). Because the Jencks Act challenge requires a remand in any event, we invite the district court to augment the record with additional details about its handling of the first jury note, including whether it attempted to appraise counsel of the note's existence, if so, whether and how quickly counsel responded, and finally, the court's ultimate response, if any, to the note. If necessary, we will address the appellant's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> remaining claims after district court proceedings pursuant to this limited remand have been concluded.</p>\n<p>Because we deal with such a small portion of this case, we provide only a background of the events that gave rise to the Jencks Act challenge and the issue concerning the jury note. Immediately after Evans completed his testimony on direct appeal, the defense requested discovery of any prior statements made by Evans relating to the subject matter of his testimony that were in the government's possession. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3500(a). The government had in its possession an FD-302 Form, which is a an FBI form that reports on and summarizes an FBI agent's interview of a witness. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Skilling,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"64496\"><a href=\"/opinion/64496/united-states-v-skilling/\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span>, 577-78 (5th Cir.2009) (describing these Forms and noting that the government disclosed them in that case). The government, however, claimed that this Form was not discoverable because the witness never adopted the Form, and therefore the contents of the Form did not constitute a \"statement\" of the witness within the meaning of the Jencks Act. 18 U.S.C. § 3500(e)(1) (defining statement of a witness to include a \"written statement\" that is \"signed or otherwise adopted\" by the witness). Over the objections of the defendant, the district court denied discovery of the FD-302 Form on this basis.</p>\n<p>We fast-forward past the rest of the trial (and the alleged errors that occurred therein) and resume with the jury's deliberations. Shortly after the jury began its deliberations, the jury sent an unsigned note to the district judge that said \"[p]lease send a copy of the indictments and the instructions of law. Please explain. Thanks a lot.\" This note was duly marked as jury note number one and docketed. But neither the docket nor the record reveals any indication of what if anything the district court did in response to the jury note. Indeed, the copy of the note in the district court docket is the only reference to the note in the record.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>On appeal, the appellant argues that the district court's Jencks Act ruling was in error, and the government agrees. <i>See</i> G'vt. Br. at 34-36. Where a defendant requests discovery of potential Jencks material, our precedent requires the district judge to conduct an <i>independent</i> investigation of any such materials and determine whether these materials are discoverable under the Jencks Act.<sup>[2]</sup> In this case, because the substance of the Form 302 was relevant to the witness's testimony, the district court should have determined whether the Form 302 was producible under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500(e).<sup>[3]</sup><i>E.g., </i><i>United States v. Rosario-Peralta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763556\"><a href=\"/opinion/763556/united-states-v-cruz-rosario-peralta-aka-crescencio-cedeno-peralta/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.1999) (explaining procedure <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> with respect to subsection(e)(1)); <i>United States v.

Moreover, it is equally clear that the witness need not write the statement himself. <i>Id.</i> Furthermore, a witness may orally adopt a statement, even if he has reviewed the statement only aurally. <i>See generally id.</i> at 489-91 (finding that copies of notes federal agent took during witness interview, the accuracy of which the agent confirmed by reading them back to witness who agreed notes were accurate, was a statement adopted by the witness for Jencks Act purposes); <i>United States v.

Finally, any materials substantially equivalent to a \"statement\" that the witness has orally adopted can themselves be considered materials \"adopted\" by the witness for purposes of the Jencks Act. <i>Campbell,</i> 373 U.S. at 495-96, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106624\"><a href=\"/opinion/106624/campbell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On remand, the parties and the district court will have the opportunity to explore this matter further.</p>\n<p>In addition, although it was not considered at length below, the district court on remand should consider whether this particular Form 302 is a \"substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement\" made by a witness and recorded contemporaneously. 18 U.S.C. § 3500(e)(2). As we have long held, a longhand writing, which \"fairly follow[s] a witness'[s] words, subject to minor, inconsequential errors\" is discoverable under § (e)(2) of the Jencks Act. <i>Neal,</i> 36 F.3d at 1198 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Thus, consistent with Supreme Court and circuit precedent, we remand this case to the district court for the limited purpose of revisiting its Jencks Act ruling in light of the proper legal standards.
