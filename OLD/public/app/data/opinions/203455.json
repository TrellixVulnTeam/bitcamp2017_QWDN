Curhan for appellant.\n     Mark T. Quinlivan, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief\nfor appellee.\n\n\n                           August 27, 2008\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.    Severin Yelaun appeals from his\n\nconviction in the federal district court for various federal fraud\n\nrelated offenses committed during a scheme to collect insurance\n\npayments for medical tests.       He also contests his sentence.       The\n\nevents that gave rise to the charges, drawing the facts primarily\n\nfrom the government's evidence at Yelaun's trial, are as follows.\n\n            In 1998 Yelaun and Igor Moyseyev started a clinic in\n\nMassachusetts -- Broadway Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, Inc.\n\n(\"Broadway\") -- to provide physical therapy and diagnostic services\n\nprimarily to auto accident victims. Moyseyev provided the funding,\n\nwhile Yelaun recruited physicians and supervised most of the day-\n\nto-day operations including billing matters; an affiliate,           Global\n\nTech    Diagnostics   (\"Global   Tech\"),   was   incorporated   to   handle\n\nadministrative matters including billing insurers for Broadway's\n\nservices.\n\n            Two of the tests used by Broadway are important to this\n\ncase.    One, the electromyogram (\"EMG\"), measures nerve and muscle\n\nfunction and, as it involves insertion of needles into the patient\n\nand real time interpretation, requires that a physician be present.\n\nThe second, called a nerve conduction velocity test (\"NCV\"), also\n\nmeasures nerve and muscle function but employs electrodes rather\n\nthan needles. For insurance purposes it requires a prescription or\n\nrequest from a doctor, as does an EMG, but unlike the EMG does not\n\nrequire the doctor's presence at the test.\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f          Although Broadway did some legitimate testing, it also\n\nbilled auto insurers for numerous EMG and NCV tests that were not\n\nin fact performed.     The EMG tests were commonly painful; the NCV\n\ntests involved shocks that could be painful.     At Yelaun's trial a\n\nnumber of the patients for whom insurance reimbursement had been\n\nsought by Global Tech for such tests testified that they had gone\n\nto Broadway for therapy but had no recollection of the needle\n\ninsertion or electric shocks that were the respective hallmarks of\n\nthe two tests.\n\n          A   doctor    affiliated   with   Broadway,   Dr.   Ranendra\n\nChatterjee, testified that his signature stamp had been used\n\nwithout authorization to stamp prescriptions for the tests and test\n\nreports; he said that he had never used the stamp for tests he had\n\nconducted or reviewed.    Dr. David Tamaren, who worked part-time at\n\nBroadway, did not testify but prescriptions he wrote for EMG and\n\nNCV tests were introduced.     The government argued from internal\n\nevidence that the prescriptions were written after the fact or were\n\notherwise fraudulent.\n\n          In mid-1999, Dr. Chatterjee discovered the misuse of his\n\nstamp and confronted Yelaun, who (Dr. Chatterjee said) admitted\n\nthat the stamp had been used \"quite a few times\" without the\n\ndoctor's authorization.    Dr. Chatterjee complained to Moyseyev and\n\nsoon thereafter Moyseyev severed his ties with Yelaun. In November\n\n1999, Yelaun with a new partner formed a new pair of companies --\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fOrthopedic Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation Center as the provider\n\nand Lynn Diagnostics Management for billing -- at a new location.\n\nDr. John Montoni, a chiropractor who had worked at Broadway and\n\nfollowed Yelaun to the Lynn clinic, testified at trial that he had\n\nwritten prescriptions for EMG and NCV tests that had never been\n\nperformed.    The same pattern of billing insurers for tests never\n\nperformed was thus repeated at least until some time in 2001 or\n\n2002.\n\n          In January 2005,   Yelaun, Moyseyev, Dr. Montoni, and Dr.\n\nTamaren were indicted on numerous counts including mail fraud, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1341 (2000), wire fraud, id. § 1343, health care fraud,\n\nid. § 1347,   conspiracy to commit an offense against or defraud the\n\nUnited States, id. § 371, money laundering, id. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i)\n\nand money laundering conspiracy, id.      § 1956(h).   Yelaun's co-\n\ndefendants accepted plea bargains but Yelaun went to trial and was\n\nconvicted on twenty-six counts of mail fraud and one count each of\n\nhealth care fraud, conspiracy to commit an offense against the\n\nUnited States, and money laundering conspiracy.\n\n          Following his sentencing -- which yielded a sentence of\n\nfifty-one months in prison, a term of supervised release, and\n\nrestitution of $88,800.84 -- Yelaun filed the present appeal.    He\n\ndoes not contest the sufficiency of the evidence but challenges the\n\nadmission of evidence against him, asserts a fatal variance as to\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fone count of the indictment and contests his sentence.            The\n\nstandard of review for his claims varies with the issue.\n\n          Yelaun first says that certain trial testimony by Dr.\n\nMontoni was admitted in error.    Dr. Montoni testified that on a\n\nspecific occasion Yelaun approached him with a box of patient\n\ncharts and asked him to sign prescriptions for EMG and NCV tests\n\nfor those patients.   The tests had already been performed, and   Dr.\n\nMontoni therefore signed the forms without assessing whether the\n\npatients needed the tests or not.        Yelaun objects only to the\n\ndoctor's further testimony that he signed the prescriptions as\n\nYelaun requested because he felt intimidated by Yelaun.\n\n          Specifically, over objection Dr. Montoni was allowed to\n\nexplain that his reason for signing the prescriptions for tests\n\nthat he had not authorized was that Yelaun frightened him because,\n\non a prior occasion, Yelaun had showed anger when Dr. Montoni had\n\nresisted doing what Yelaun wanted.     Yelaun says that the testimony\n\nwas irrelevant except for the forbidden inference of bad character,\n\nsee Fed. R. Evid. 404(a), and was in any case highly prejudicial\n\nand therefore inadmissible, Fed. R. Evid. 403.        We will assume\n\narguendo that the objections were all properly preserved.\n\n          With limited exceptions, evidence to show the defendant's\n\nbad character is normally inadmissible in a criminal trial; but the\n\nvery same facts illustrating bad character can be admitted, with a\n\nlimiting instruction if sought, to show something else that is\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\frelevant to the case.     Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).        In this instance, the\n\ngovernment had ample legitimate reason to explain why at Yelaun's\n\nbehest Dr. Montoni signed prescriptions for tests that he had not\n\ndetermined to be medically necessary.\n\n           Absent some explanation as to why Dr. Montoni willingly\n\nparticipated in a fraud at Yelaun's request, a jury might well\n\ninfer that Dr. Montoni was not credible but had made up the story\n\nto secure his plea bargain.        Inevitably, defense counsel was going\n\nto seek to impeach the doctor based on his own plea bargain with\n\nthe government -- and also with Dr. Montoni's initial statements to\n\npolice   that   he   could   not   remember    signing    the    EMG    and   NCV\n\nprescriptions.       Both the admitted fraud and the initial denials\n\nunderscored doubts about his credibility.\n\n           The explanation given by Dr. Montoni -- that he was\n\nafraid of Yelaun based on Yelaun's prior exhibitions of temper --\n\ntended to make Dr. Montoni's main testimony about Yelaun's demand\n\nmore   plausible,     countering    any    inference   that     Dr.    Montoni's\n\nsignatures had been supplied on his own and without Yelaun's\n\ninvolvement.     The context       also tended to counter any potential\n\ninference that Dr. Montoni -- who had in some instances properly\n\nprescribed such tests for patients -- was simply confused or\n\nmistaken about the episode in question.\n\n           Case law supports the relevance and admissibility of such\n\ncontextual testimony. United States v. Bartelho, 129 F.3d 663, 676\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f(1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 905 (1998) (allowing\n\ndefendant's girlfriend to testify that she was intimidated by him\n\nto explain why she initially lied to the police and committed\n\nperjury); cf. United States v. Balsam, 203 F.3d 72, 85 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 531 U.S. 852 (2000) (defendant's former girlfriend\n\nallowed to testify that she feared him to explain her reluctance to\n\ntestify).   In any event, the evidence was logically relevant for a\n\nreason other than bad character, which is Rule 404(b)'s ultimate\n\ntest.\n\n            Of course, relevant evidence can be excluded under Rule\n\n403 if it is substantially more prejudicial than \"probative\" (i.e.,\n\ntending to prove a fact in issue), but this is a fact-specific\n\nbalancing judgment by the trial judge reviewed only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 155-\n\n56 (1st Cir. 1989).   In this case, the fact that Yelaun had a bad\n\ntemper and that Dr. Montoni feared him was relevant and at best\n\nminimally prejudicial: the crime charged, after all, was fraud, not\n\nassault, and bad temper does not normally suggest a propensity to\n\ncommit fraud.\n\n            Yelaun's more interesting claim of error is that there\n\nwas a variance between the indictment's count 43, which charged him\n\nwith conspiracy to commit money laundering, and the proof at trial.\n\nCount 43, on which Yelaun was convicted, charged that from in or\n\nabout January 1999 through in or after 2002, Yelaun and Moyseyev:\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f           did knowingly and unlawfully conspire with\n           each other and with others known and unknown\n           to the Grand Jury, knowingly to conduct and\n           attempt to conduct financial transactions\n           affecting interstate and foreign commerce,\n           that is, to engage in financial transactions\n           involving United States currency and bank\n           checks, which in fact involved the proceeds of\n           specified unlawful activity, that is, Mail\n           Fraud in violation of Title 18, United States\n           Code, Section[] 1341, Wire Fraud in violation\n           of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343,\n           and Health Care Fraud in violation of Title\n           18, United States Code, Section 1347, with\n           intent to promote the carrying on of said\n           specified unlawful activity, and knowing that\n           the transactions were designed in whole and in\n           part to conceal and disguise the nature,\n           location, source, ownership, and control of\n           the proceeds of that specified unlawful\n           activity, and knowing, while conducting and\n           attempting    to   conduct   such    financial\n           transactions, that the property involved in\n           the financial transactions represented the\n           proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, in\n           violation of 18 U.S.C. §1956(a)(1)(A)(i) and\n           (B)(i).\n\n           The substantive money laundering counts (counts 44 to 58)\n\nidentified checks that Global Tech gave Symco Medical Billing, an\n\noutside collection agency hired by Global Tech and Lynn to handle\n\nsome billing and collections, and two checks to Global Tech's\n\naccountant.   At trial, the government dismissed the substantive\n\nmoney   laundering   counts.   To    prove   count   43,   the   government\n\nintroduced Global Tech checks given to Broadway employees and to\n\nYelaun for legitimate purposes (e.g., as salary checks).\n\n           Yelaun's objection, at trial and on appeal, is that the\n\nuse of the employee checks was a \"variance\" from the indictment\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fbecause count 43 had (although not expressly so) relied only upon\n\nthe checks paid to Symco and the Global Tech accountant identified\n\nin withdrawn counts 43-58, which charged specific acts of money\n\nlaundering.     Yelaun does not dispute that the employee checks were\n\na rational means of showing both the laundering of the funds and\n\ntheir use to promote the enterprise, just as charged in the\n\nindictment.     The objection is to the alleged variance.\n\n           A    variance       occurs    when    the     crime   charged    remains\n\nunaltered, but the evidence adduced at trial proves different facts\n\nthan those alleged in the indictment. United States v. Mueffelman,\n\n470 F.3d 33, 38 (1st Cir. 2006).                A variance does not warrant\n\nreversal   unless    it    is    prejudicial,     e.g.,     by   undermining      the\n\ndefendant's right \"to 'have sufficient knowledge of the charge\n\nagainst him . . . to prepare an effective defense and avoid\n\nsurprise at trial, and to prevent a second prosecution for the same\n\noffense.'\"     United States v. DeCicco, 439 F.3d 36, 47 n.4 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (quoting United States v. Tormos-Vega, 959 F.2d 1103, 1115\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 866 (1992)).\n\n           Here, there was no variance at all, prejudicial or\n\notherwise.      Count     43    did     not   identify    any    checks    or   other\n\ntransactions as the basis for that count.                The defense could have\n\nsought a bill of particulars to identify specific transactions,\n\nUnited States v. Barbato, 471 F.2d 918, 921 (1st Cir. 1973), but it\n\ndid not.   At best, the defense could merely have assumed -- wrongly\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fas it turned out -- that the government would rely on transactions\n\nmentioned in the substantive money laundering counts to prove the\n\nconspiracy. Using different transactions did not \"vary\" any proof\n\npromised by count 43 because the count identified no specific\n\ntransactions.\n\n             Relatedly, Yelaun says that he was unfairly surprised by\n\nthe use of the employee checks because the government misled him by\n\ntelling him it was going to rely on the checks listed in the\n\nsubstantive money laundering counts to prove count 43.                  No support\n\nfor this claim is supplied; in fact, the government produced the\n\nchecks to employees in pretrial discovery, listed them as exhibits\n\nto be introduced, and argued in its opening that it would be\n\nrelying on the checks to employees to prove count 43.\n\n             Further,    when   Yelaun   objected      to   the    offer   of    the\n\nemployee checks, government counsel at sidebar said that the\n\nprosecution     had     explicitly    told   Yelaun's       counsel     that     the\n\ngovernment intended to rely on the employee checks to prove count\n\n43; nothing indicates that defense counsel disputed this assertion.\n\nIf   the   defense    wanted    a   formal   inquiry    into      the   matter   of\n\nrepresentations, or a delay in the trial to counter the supposed\n\nsurprise evidence, the time to ask was at the trial.               United States\n\nv. Wright, 573 F.2d 681, 685 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 949\n\n(1978); United States v. Antonelli, 439 F.2d 1068, 1070 (1st Cir.\n\n1971).     No such request was made.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f            Finally, Yelaun challenges two sentencing enhancements\n\nadopted by the trial judge in calculating the guideline range for\n\nYelaun's sentence.    Using the 2002 version of the guidelines, the\n\njudge adopted an adjusted offense level of twenty-four which, with\n\nYelaun's criminal history level I, yielded a guideline range of\n\nfifty-one to sixty-three months. Yelaun's fifty-one month sentence\n\nwas at the bottom of the range.        A mistake in calculating the range\n\ncould conceivably have affected the sentence, but there was no\n\nmistake.\n\n            In finding an offense level of level twenty-four, the\n\ndistrict judge identified a base offense level of six for fraud,\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(a), and then added a ten level enhancement for\n\ncausing an amount of loss between $120,000 and $200,000, U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2B1.1(b)(1)(F), a two level enhancement for a scheme involving\n\nmore   than    ten   but   less   than       fifty   victims,     U.S.S.G.   §\n\n2B1.1(b)(2)(A)(i), a four level enhancement based on Yelaun's role\n\nas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five\n\nor   more   participants   or   was    otherwise     extensive,   U.S.S.G.   §\n\n3B1.1(a), and a two level enhancement for obstruction of justice,\n\nsee U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1.\n\n            Yelaun first challenges the amount-of-loss calculation on\n\ntwo different grounds -- one legal and one factual.                 His legal\n\nobjection, which we review de novo, is that the judge rather than\n\na jury found the facts establishing the amount of loss under the\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fguidelines and that this violates the Sixth Amendment.    But United\n\nStates v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), resolved this concern by\n\nmaking the guidelines advisory.    See United States v. Ziskind, 491\n\nF.3d 10, 17 (1st Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 1305 (2008).\n\nIt is only where the findings at issue (here, the loss findings)\n\nraise the statutory maximum sentence or constitute an element of\n\nthe crime that a jury finding is necessary.      Booker, 543 U.S. at\n\n230-37, 244; United States v. Bermudez, 407 F.3d 536, 545 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 921 (2005).    Neither is true in this\n\ninstance.\n\n            Yelaun's factual challenge to the computation is that the\n\nevidence failed to show a loss of at least $120,000.    The district\n\njudge calculated the loss as $179,534.74, which reflected all EMG\n\nand NCV tests billed by Global Tech or Lynn Diagnostics with test\n\nreports were signed by Dr. Montoni or stamped with Dr. Chatterjee's\n\nsignature stamp. Conceding that the EMG losses were proven, Yelaun\n\nsays that there was insufficient evidence that the NCV tests were\n\nnot performed.     Review is for clear error.      United States v.\n\nPhaneuf, 91 F.3d 255, 261 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            Dr. Chatterjee testified that he never authorized the use\n\nof, nor in fact used, his signature stamp to sign any NCV reports,\n\nso any NCV reports bearing his signature stamp were based on\n\nfraudulent documents.    Dr. Montoni was not authorized to perform\n\nNCV tests and testified that he had never performed any such tests,\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fand that he did not know whether the tests in the reports he signed\n\nhad been performed.       Thus, insurance claims based on test reports\n\nbearing his signature were supported by fraudulent documents. This\n\nwould be enough standing alone to support the loss finding, but\n\nthere is more.\n\n            Dr. Montoni testified that several of the tests bearing\n\nhis signature were identical for different patients, a virtual\n\nimpossibility     if    the    tests       were   legitimate.       Dr.     Chatterjee\n\nsimilarly    testified        that    some    patients'    reports     bearing     his\n\nsignature stamps were identical and that Global Tech had billed for\n\nup to fifteen tests signed by him in a day, which he testified he\n\nhad not performed.       All this, with the patient testimony as well,\n\nprovided more than enough evidence to support the loss calculation\n\nadopted by the district judge.\n\n            Yelaun also disputes the four level enhancement for being\n\na leader or organizer of a conspiracy that involved five or more\n\nparticipants or was otherwise extensive.                  U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1.        He\n\ncontests both prongs of the enhancement, arguing that he was not an\n\norganizer or leader of the conspiracy and that the conspiracy did\n\nnot   involve    five   or    more     participants     and   was     not   otherwise\n\nextensive.      As to the second prong, a finding that the conspiracy\n\nwas   otherwise    extensive         was   sufficient     with   or   without    five\n\nparticipants.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\f            Yelaun's argument as to his role as an organizer or\n\nleader is, in essence, that he was a subordinate of Moyseyev, who\n\ncontrolled Broadway and who ultimately fired Yelaun.            In fact, the\n\ntestimony at trial showed that Yelaun played a major role at\n\nBroadway in its day-to-day operations. He had greater knowledge of\n\nthe business than Moyseyev and was in charge of finding doctors,\n\nscheduling, running the billing and training the administrative\n\nstaff.     See U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1, cmt. 4 (setting forth criteria for\n\nleader or organizer; more than one individual can so qualify).\n\n            As to Lynn Diagnostics, it appears that Yelaun's control\n\nwas at least as great as at Broadway.           He recruited Drs. Tamaren\n\nand Montoni for the new enterprise, ran the billing and seems to\n\nhave generally been running the day-to-day operations. The outside\n\nbilling company he worked with believed he owned Lynn.             Even with\n\nfewer specifics, it would be a fair inference that his importance\n\nand role were at least as significant in the new and smaller\n\ncompany as in its predecessor.\n\n            Yelaun says that in determining that the conspiracy was\n\nextensive,    the   judge   conflated   the   two   different     enterprises\n\nsuccessively operated by Yelaun; but each involved the services of\n\nnumerous     employees   and   a   fairly     complex   scheme,    involving\n\nfalsifying medical reports and prescriptions and follow up billings\n\nbased on that false documentation. Cf. United States v. Twitty, 72\n\nF.3d 228, 234 (1st Cir. 1995).       Either scheme could be considered\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f\"otherwise extensive\" in its own right.   So the enhancement was\n\nproper regardless of the number of employees.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -15-\n\f",

Severin Yelaun appeals from his\n\nconviction in the federal district court for various federal fraud\n\nrelated offenses committed during a scheme to collect insurance\n\npayments for medical tests.       He also contests his sentence.       The\n\nevents that gave rise to the charges, drawing the facts primarily\n\nfrom the government's evidence at Yelaun's trial, are as follows.\n\n            In 1998 Yelaun and Igor Moyseyev started a clinic in\n\nMassachusetts -- Broadway Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, Inc.\n\n(\"Broadway\") -- to provide physical therapy and diagnostic services\n\nprimarily to auto accident victims. Moyseyev provided the funding,\n\nwhile Yelaun recruited physicians and supervised most of the day-\n\nto-day operations including billing matters; an affiliate,           Global\n\nTech    Diagnostics   (\"Global   Tech\"),   was   incorporated   to   handle\n\nadministrative matters including billing insurers for Broadway's\n\nservices.\n\n            Two of the tests used by Broadway are important to this\n\ncase.    One, the electromyogram (\"EMG\"), measures nerve and muscle\n\nfunction and, as it involves insertion of needles into the patient\n\nand real time interpretation, requires that a physician be present.\n\nThe second, called a nerve conduction velocity test (\"NCV\"), also\n\nmeasures nerve and muscle function but employs electrodes rather\n\nthan needles. For insurance purposes it requires a prescription or\n\nrequest from a doctor, as does an EMG, but unlike the EMG does not\n\nrequire the doctor's presence at the test.\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f          Although Broadway did some legitimate testing, it also\n\nbilled auto insurers for numerous EMG and NCV tests that were not\n\nin fact performed.     The EMG tests were commonly painful; the NCV\n\ntests involved shocks that could be painful.     At Yelaun's trial a\n\nnumber of the patients for whom insurance reimbursement had been\n\nsought by Global Tech for such tests testified that they had gone\n\nto Broadway for therapy but had no recollection of the needle\n\ninsertion or electric shocks that were the respective hallmarks of\n\nthe two tests.\n\n          A   doctor    affiliated   with   Broadway,   Dr.   Ranendra\n\nChatterjee, testified that his signature stamp had been used\n\nwithout authorization to stamp prescriptions for the tests and test\n\nreports; he said that he had never used the stamp for tests he had\n\nconducted or reviewed.    Dr. David Tamaren, who worked part-time at\n\nBroadway, did not testify but prescriptions he wrote for EMG and\n\nNCV tests were introduced.     The government argued from internal\n\nevidence that the prescriptions were written after the fact or were\n\notherwise fraudulent.\n\n          In mid-1999, Dr. Chatterjee discovered the misuse of his\n\nstamp and confronted Yelaun, who (Dr. Chatterjee said) admitted\n\nthat the stamp had been used \"quite a few times\" without the\n\ndoctor's authorization.    Dr. Chatterjee complained to Moyseyev and\n\nsoon thereafter Moyseyev severed his ties with Yelaun. In November\n\n1999, Yelaun with a new partner formed a new pair of companies --\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fOrthopedic Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation Center as the provider\n\nand Lynn Diagnostics Management for billing -- at a new location.\n\nDr. John Montoni, a chiropractor who had worked at Broadway and\n\nfollowed Yelaun to the Lynn clinic, testified at trial that he had\n\nwritten prescriptions for EMG and NCV tests that had never been\n\nperformed.    The same pattern of billing insurers for tests never\n\nperformed was thus repeated at least until some time in 2001 or\n\n2002.\n\n          In January 2005,   Yelaun, Moyseyev, Dr. Montoni, and Dr.\n\nTamaren were indicted on numerous counts including mail fraud, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1341 (2000), wire fraud, id. § 1343, health care fraud,\n\nid. § 1347,   conspiracy to commit an offense against or defraud the\n\nUnited States, id. § 371, money laundering, id. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i)\n\nand money laundering conspiracy, id.      § 1956(h).   Yelaun's co-\n\ndefendants accepted plea bargains but Yelaun went to trial and was\n\nconvicted on twenty-six counts of mail fraud and one count each of\n\nhealth care fraud, conspiracy to commit an offense against the\n\nUnited States, and money laundering conspiracy.\n\n          Following his sentencing -- which yielded a sentence of\n\nfifty-one months in prison, a term of supervised release, and\n\nrestitution of $88,800.84 -- Yelaun filed the present appeal.    He\n\ndoes not contest the sufficiency of the evidence but challenges the\n\nadmission of evidence against him, asserts a fatal variance as to\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fone count of the indictment and contests his sentence.            The\n\nstandard of review for his claims varies with the issue.\n\n          Yelaun first says that certain trial testimony by Dr.\n\nMontoni was admitted in error.    Dr. Montoni testified that on a\n\nspecific occasion Yelaun approached him with a box of patient\n\ncharts and asked him to sign prescriptions for EMG and NCV tests\n\nfor those patients.   The tests had already been performed, and   Dr.\n\nMontoni therefore signed the forms without assessing whether the\n\npatients needed the tests or not.        Yelaun objects only to the\n\ndoctor's further testimony that he signed the prescriptions as\n\nYelaun requested because he felt intimidated by Yelaun.\n\n          Specifically, over objection Dr. Montoni was allowed to\n\nexplain that his reason for signing the prescriptions for tests\n\nthat he had not authorized was that Yelaun frightened him because,\n\non a prior occasion, Yelaun had showed anger when Dr. Montoni had\n\nresisted doing what Yelaun wanted.     Yelaun says that the testimony\n\nwas irrelevant except for the forbidden inference of bad character,\n\nsee Fed. R. Evid. 404(a), and was in any case highly prejudicial\n\nand therefore inadmissible, Fed. R. Evid. 403.        We will assume\n\narguendo that the objections were all properly preserved.\n\n          With limited exceptions, evidence to show the defendant's\n\nbad character is normally inadmissible in a criminal trial; but the\n\nvery same facts illustrating bad character can be admitted, with a\n\nlimiting instruction if sought, to show something else that is\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\frelevant to the case.     Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).        In this instance, the\n\ngovernment had ample legitimate reason to explain why at Yelaun's\n\nbehest Dr. Montoni signed prescriptions for tests that he had not\n\ndetermined to be medically necessary.\n\n           Absent some explanation as to why Dr. Montoni willingly\n\nparticipated in a fraud at Yelaun's request, a jury might well\n\ninfer that Dr. Montoni was not credible but had made up the story\n\nto secure his plea bargain.        Inevitably, defense counsel was going\n\nto seek to impeach the doctor based on his own plea bargain with\n\nthe government -- and also with Dr. Montoni's initial statements to\n\npolice   that   he   could   not   remember    signing    the    EMG    and   NCV\n\nprescriptions.       Both the admitted fraud and the initial denials\n\nunderscored doubts about his credibility.\n\n           The explanation given by Dr. Montoni -- that he was\n\nafraid of Yelaun based on Yelaun's prior exhibitions of temper --\n\ntended to make Dr. Montoni's main testimony about Yelaun's demand\n\nmore   plausible,     countering    any    inference   that     Dr.    Montoni's\n\nsignatures had been supplied on his own and without Yelaun's\n\ninvolvement.     The context       also tended to counter any potential\n\ninference that Dr. Montoni -- who had in some instances properly\n\nprescribed such tests for patients -- was simply confused or\n\nmistaken about the episode in question.\n\n           Case law supports the relevance and admissibility of such\n\ncontextual testimony.

In this case, the fact that Yelaun had a bad\n\ntemper and that Dr. Montoni feared him was relevant and at best\n\nminimally prejudicial: the crime charged, after all, was fraud, not\n\nassault, and bad temper does not normally suggest a propensity to\n\ncommit fraud.\n\n            Yelaun's more interesting claim of error is that there\n\nwas a variance between the indictment's count 43, which charged him\n\nwith conspiracy to commit money laundering, and the proof at trial.\n\nCount 43, on which Yelaun was convicted, charged that from in or\n\nabout January 1999 through in or after 2002, Yelaun and Moyseyev:\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f           did knowingly and unlawfully conspire with\n           each other and with others known and unknown\n           to the Grand Jury, knowingly to conduct and\n           attempt to conduct financial transactions\n           affecting interstate and foreign commerce,\n           that is, to engage in financial transactions\n           involving United States currency and bank\n           checks, which in fact involved the proceeds of\n           specified unlawful activity, that is, Mail\n           Fraud in violation of Title 18, United States\n           Code, Section[] 1341, Wire Fraud in violation\n           of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343,\n           and Health Care Fraud in violation of Title\n           18, United States Code, Section 1347, with\n           intent to promote the carrying on of said\n           specified unlawful activity, and knowing that\n           the transactions were designed in whole and in\n           part to conceal and disguise the nature,\n           location, source, ownership, and control of\n           the proceeds of that specified unlawful\n           activity, and knowing, while conducting and\n           attempting    to   conduct   such    financial\n           transactions, that the property involved in\n           the financial transactions represented the\n           proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, in\n           violation of 18 U.S.C. §1956(a)(1)(A)(i) and\n           (B)(i).\n\n           The substantive money laundering counts (counts 44 to 58)\n\nidentified checks that Global Tech gave Symco Medical Billing, an\n\noutside collection agency hired by Global Tech and Lynn to handle\n\nsome billing and collections, and two checks to Global Tech's\n\naccountant.   At trial, the government dismissed the substantive\n\nmoney   laundering   counts.   To    prove   count   43,   the   government\n\nintroduced Global Tech checks given to Broadway employees and to\n\nYelaun for legitimate purposes (e.g., as salary checks).\n\n           Yelaun's objection, at trial and on appeal, is that the\n\nuse of the employee checks was a \"variance\" from the indictment\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fbecause count 43 had (although not expressly so) relied only upon\n\nthe checks paid to Symco and the Global Tech accountant identified\n\nin withdrawn counts 43-58, which charged specific acts of money\n\nlaundering.     Yelaun does not dispute that the employee checks were\n\na rational means of showing both the laundering of the funds and\n\ntheir use to promote the enterprise, just as charged in the\n\nindictment.     The objection is to the alleged variance.\n\n           A    variance       occurs    when    the     crime   charged    remains\n\nunaltered, but the evidence adduced at trial proves different facts\n\nthan those alleged in the indictment.

Using different transactions did not \"vary\" any proof\n\npromised by count 43 because the count identified no specific\n\ntransactions.\n\n             Relatedly, Yelaun says that he was unfairly surprised by\n\nthe use of the employee checks because the government misled him by\n\ntelling him it was going to rely on the checks listed in the\n\nsubstantive money laundering counts to prove count 43.                  No support\n\nfor this claim is supplied; in fact, the government produced the\n\nchecks to employees in pretrial discovery, listed them as exhibits\n\nto be introduced, and argued in its opening that it would be\n\nrelying on the checks to employees to prove count 43.\n\n             Further,    when   Yelaun   objected      to   the    offer   of    the\n\nemployee checks, government counsel at sidebar said that the\n\nprosecution     had     explicitly    told   Yelaun's       counsel     that     the\n\ngovernment intended to rely on the employee checks to prove count\n\n43; nothing indicates that defense counsel disputed this assertion.\n\nIf   the   defense    wanted    a   formal   inquiry    into      the   matter   of\n\nrepresentations, or a delay in the trial to counter the supposed\n\nsurprise evidence, the time to ask was at the trial.

Using the 2002 version of the guidelines, the\n\njudge adopted an adjusted offense level of twenty-four which, with\n\nYelaun's criminal history level I, yielded a guideline range of\n\nfifty-one to sixty-three months. Yelaun's fifty-one month sentence\n\nwas at the bottom of the range.        A mistake in calculating the range\n\ncould conceivably have affected the sentence, but there was no\n\nmistake.\n\n            In finding an offense level of level twenty-four, the\n\ndistrict judge identified a base offense level of six for fraud,\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(a), and then added a ten level enhancement for\n\ncausing an amount of loss between $120,000 and $200,000, U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2B1.1(b)(1)(F), a two level enhancement for a scheme involving\n\nmore   than    ten   but   less   than       fifty   victims,     U.S.S.G.   §\n\n2B1.1(b)(2)(A)(i), a four level enhancement based on Yelaun's role\n\nas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five\n\nor   more   participants   or   was    otherwise     extensive,   U.S.S.G.   §\n\n3B1.1(a), and a two level enhancement for obstruction of justice,\n\nsee U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1.\n\n            Yelaun first challenges the amount-of-loss calculation on\n\ntwo different grounds -- one legal and one factual.                 His legal\n\nobjection, which we review de novo, is that the judge rather than\n\na jury found the facts establishing the amount of loss under the\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fguidelines and that this violates the Sixth Amendment.    But United\n\nStates v. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), resolved this concern by\n\nmaking the guidelines advisory.    See United States v. Ziskind, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202806\"><a href=\"/opinion/202806/united-states-v-ziskind/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st Cir. 2007), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1305</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2008).\n\nIt is only where the findings at issue (here, the loss findings)\n\nraise the statutory maximum sentence or constitute an element of\n\nthe crime that a jury finding is necessary.      Booker, 543 U.S. at\n\n230-37, 244; United States v. Bermudez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201598\"><a href=\"/opinion/201598/united-states-v-bermudez/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 545 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005).    Neither is true in this\n\ninstance.\n\n            Yelaun's factual challenge to the computation is that the\n\nevidence failed to show a loss of at least $120,000.    The district\n\njudge calculated the loss as $179,534.74, which reflected all EMG\n\nand NCV tests billed by Global Tech or Lynn Diagnostics with test\n\nreports were signed by Dr. Montoni or stamped with Dr. Chatterjee's\n\nsignature stamp. Conceding that the EMG losses were proven, Yelaun\n\nsays that there was insufficient evidence that the NCV tests were\n\nnot performed.     Review is for clear error.      United States v.\n\nPhaneuf, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196902\"><a href=\"/opinion/196902/united-states-v-phaneuf/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 261 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            Dr. Chatterjee testified that he never authorized the use\n\nof, nor in fact used, his signature stamp to sign any NCV reports,\n\nso any NCV reports bearing his signature stamp were based on\n\nfraudulent documents.    Dr. Montoni was not authorized to perform\n\nNCV tests and testified that he had never performed any such tests,\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fand that he did not know whether the tests in the reports he signed\n\nhad been performed.       Thus, insurance claims based on test reports\n\nbearing his signature were supported by fraudulent documents. This\n\nwould be enough standing alone to support the loss finding, but\n\nthere is more.\n\n            Dr. Montoni testified that several of the tests bearing\n\nhis signature were identical for different patients, a virtual\n\nimpossibility     if    the    tests       were   legitimate.       Dr.     Chatterjee\n\nsimilarly    testified        that    some    patients'    reports     bearing     his\n\nsignature stamps were identical and that Global Tech had billed for\n\nup to fifteen tests signed by him in a day, which he testified he\n\nhad not performed.       All this, with the patient testimony as well,\n\nprovided more than enough evidence to support the loss calculation\n\nadopted by the district judge.\n\n            Yelaun also disputes the four level enhancement for being\n\na leader or organizer of a conspiracy that involved five or more\n\nparticipants or was otherwise extensive.                  U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1.        He\n\ncontests both prongs of the enhancement, arguing that he was not an\n\norganizer or leader of the conspiracy and that the conspiracy did\n\nnot   involve    five   or    more     participants     and   was     not   otherwise\n\nextensive.      As to the second prong, a finding that the conspiracy\n\nwas   otherwise    extensive         was   sufficient     with   or   without    five\n\nparticipants.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\f            Yelaun's argument as to his role as an organizer or\n\nleader is, in essence, that he was a subordinate of Moyseyev, who\n\ncontrolled Broadway and who ultimately fired Yelaun.            In fact, the\n\ntestimony at trial showed that Yelaun played a major role at\n\nBroadway in its day-to-day operations. He had greater knowledge of\n\nthe business than Moyseyev and was in charge of finding doctors,\n\nscheduling, running the billing and training the administrative\n\nstaff.     See U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1, cmt. 4 (setting forth criteria for\n\nleader or organizer; more than one individual can so qualify).\n\n            As to Lynn Diagnostics, it appears that Yelaun's control\n\nwas at least as great as at Broadway.           He recruited Drs. Tamaren\n\nand Montoni for the new enterprise, ran the billing and seems to\n\nhave generally been running the day-to-day operations. The outside\n\nbilling company he worked with believed he owned Lynn.             Even with\n\nfewer specifics, it would be a fair inference that his importance\n\nand role were at least as significant in the new and smaller\n\ncompany as in its predecessor.\n\n            Yelaun says that in determining that the conspiracy was\n\nextensive,    the   judge   conflated   the   two   different     enterprises\n\nsuccessively operated by Yelaun; but each involved the services of\n\nnumerous     employees   and   a   fairly     complex   scheme,    involving\n\nfalsifying medical reports and prescriptions and follow up billings\n\nbased on that false documentation. Cf. United States v. Twitty, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196496\"><a href=\"/opinion/196496/united-states-v-twitty/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 234 (1st Cir. 1995).       Either scheme could be considered\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f\"otherwise extensive\" in its own right.   So the enhancement was\n\nproper regardless of the number of employees.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -15-\n\f</pre>",
