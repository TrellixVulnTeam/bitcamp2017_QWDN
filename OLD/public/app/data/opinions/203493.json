The    Department        of\n\nHomeland Security charged Petitioner Zhou Lu, a citizen of\n\nthe Peoples Republic of China, with unauthorized entry into\n\nthe        United    States      under   8     U.S.C.      §     1182(a)(6)(A)(i).\n\nPetitioner           admitted      the   charge’s          factual       allegations\n\n(contained in a Notice to Appear) and filed an application\n\nfor    asylum        and   withholding        of   removal.           See    8   U.S.C.\n\n§§    1158(b),       1231(b)(3). 1       In    her      application,        Petitioner\n\nalleged       a     fear   of    persecution       in    China       related     to    her\n\ninvolvement with Falun Gong.\n\n       Following a hearing at which Petitioner testified at\n\nlength, the Immigration Judge (IJ) found her not credible.\n\nSee id. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii),(iii) (establishing framework\n\nfor credibility determinations).                   Based on blanket findings,\n\nthe    IJ     first     concluded     Petitioner         was    not    eligible        for\n\nasylum.        The IJ explained that Petitioner did not meet her\n\nburden of establishing that she was a “refugee” within the\n\nmeaning       of    8   U.S.C.    §   1101(a)(42),        i.e.,       having     a    well\n\nfounded fear of persecution based on membership in, among\n\nother things, a religious or particular social group.                                  See\n\nid. § 1158(b) (requiring applicant for asylum to establish\n\nrefugee status).            The IJ next concluded that Petitioner was\n\n\n       1\n      Petitioner also unsuccessfully sought relief under\nthe United Nations Convention Against Torture.

See id. §\n\n1231(b)(3).            The     Board       of    Immigration      Appeals      (BIA)\n\ndismissed Petitioner’s appeal, concluding the IJ’s adverse\n\ncredibility determination was not clearly erroneous.                           See 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).\n\n      In Jiang v. Gonzales, 474 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\nwe    set   forth      the    standard      of    review      applicable      to   the\n\npresent Petition:\n\n      This court reviews findings of fact in immigration\n      proceedings, including findings with respect to\n      credibility, to determine whether those findings\n      are supported by substantial evidence in the\n      record.      Under  that   standard,   an   adverse\n      credibility determination may stand if it is\n      supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative\n      evidence on the record considered as a whole.\n\n(internal quotations and citation omitted).                           We need not\n\nrepeat Petitioner’s story here.                   We have carefully reviewed\n\nthe entire record and the parties’ briefs, and conclude that\n\nthe    IJ   and    BIA   reached       a    permissible       result       under   the\n\napplicable law.              We have repeatedly opined that “‘when a\n\nlower    court     accurately      takes         the   measure   of    a    case   and\n\narticulates a cogent rationale, it serves no useful purpose\n\nfor a reviewing court to write at length.’”                           Metropolitan\n\nLife Ins.
