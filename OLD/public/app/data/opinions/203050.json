See Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 12(b)(6). Our review of a Rule 12(b)(6)dismissal is de\n\nnovo.    See Diaz-Ramos v.

Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp., 496\n\nF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2007).                      Consequently, we proceed to\n\nsummarize       the     facts      of    this     case       as    they     appear      in\n\nplaintiffs’ complaint.              See id. at 4.\n\n                                          I.\n\n        From October 1998 to January 2003, the Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico’s Administration of Juvenile Institutions (AJI)\n\ncontracted with Southwest Key Program (Southwest) to run the\n\nPonce    Detention          and   Training       School       Center      for    Girls.\n\nPlaintiffs served as custody officers or technicians in the\n\nPonce Detention Center during this period.                          In January 2003,\n\nthe AJI decided to reassume direct responsibility for the\n\ncenter’s operations.              On January 17, 2003, Defendant Negrón,\n\nwho served as the AJI’s administrator, came to the center\n\nand met with Southwest’s employees.                     At this meeting, Negrón\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\finformed Southwest’s employees that they would be able to\n\ncontinue working at the center under temporary government\n\nappointments.            Thereafter,          Negrón    assured        Southwest’s\n\nemployees that they would receive permanent appointments to\n\ngovernment positions at the center.\n\n       Plaintiffs did receive temporary appointments to their\n\nprior positions.          These appointments commenced on January\n\n17, 2003, and ended on June 30, 2003.                       Although plaintiffs\n\ndid    not     receive     further       temporary          appointments,        they\n\ncontinued working at the center until April 2004.                           During\n\nthis    interim      period,         plaintiffs    applied       for     permanent\n\ngovernment      positions       with     the    AJI.         Despite     Defendant\n\nNegrón’s       promise        that     they     would       receive      permanent\n\ngovernment       positions       at      the    center,       plaintiffs         were\n\nterminated on April 30, 2004.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that Defendant Negrón’s promise gave\n\nthem    a     legitimate       claim     of     entitlement       to     permanent\n\ngovernment employment under Puerto Rico law. In addition,\n\nplaintiffs      claim     a     right,     under       Commonwealth       law,     to\n\nnotification of the identities of the individuals who were\n\nultimately placed in the permanent positions for which they\n\napplied.       Plaintiffs claim that the Commonwealth’s failure\n\nto    grant   them   permanent         positions       of   employment     at     the\n\ncenter, or notify them of the identity of the individuals\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fselected         to       replace      them,    amounts         to   a    procedural       and\n\nsubstantive           violation        of   the      Due       Process    Clause     of    the\n\nFourteenth Amendment.\n\n                                               II.\n\n       To       survive      a   motion        to    dismiss,        a    complaint       must\n\nestablish “a plausible entitlement to relief.”                                  Bell Atl.\n\nCorp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1967 (2007). Plaintiffs\n\nclaim the Commonwealth violated their rights under the Due\n\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.                                   In order to\n\nstate       a    valid       claim      for     a    procedural          or   substantive\n\nviolation            of    the   Due     Process       Clause,           plaintiffs       must\n\n“exhibit         a    constitutionally              protected        interest   in    life,\n\nliberty, or property.”                   Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v.\n\nFeliciano de Melecio, 406 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2005).                                        In\n\nthis       case,          plaintiffs        assert         a     violation      of    their\n\n“proprietary rights.”                   Property interests are created and\n\ndefined by “existing rules or understandings that stem from\n\nan independent source such as state law.” 1                           Hatfield-Bermudez\n\nv. Aldanondo-Rivera, 496 F.3d 51, 59 (1st Cir. 2007).                                       In\n\norder to qualify as a property interest, state law must give\n\nan “individual a legitimate claim of entitlement to some\n\nsort of benefit.”                Id.\n\n\n       1\n        “For purposes of section 1983, Puerto Rico is the\nfunctional equivalent of a state.”  Pagan v. Calderon, 448\nF.3d 16, 31 n.6 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                               -5-\n\f                                               A.\n\n      We first address plaintiffs’ claim that Negrón’s promise\n\ngave them a property interest in a permanent position of\n\ngovernment employment.               Puerto Rico law provides for the\n\nappointment of temporary or “transitory employees.”                                   Dept.\n\nof Natural Res. v. Correa, 18 P.R. Offic. Trans. 795, 801\n\n(1987).      A transitory employee does not have a “legitimate\n\njob retention expectancy once his appointment expires.”                                  Id.\n\nat   804.        The     question    in    this           case   is   whether      Negrón’s\n\npromise      effectively         altered            the    status       quo.       See   id.\n\n(inquiring         whether       a   transitory              government          employee’s\n\n“particular circumstances” gave him “a legitimate expectancy\n\nof continuity” in his job).\n\n      In Correa, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico answered\n\nthis question.            In that case, the Court found an employee\n\nwho was given several temporary appointments, as well as a\n\npromise of permanent employment, did not have a legitimate\n\nexpectation         of     continued       employment             with     a     government\n\nagency.          See id. at 805-06.                  Reasoning the employee was\n\n“aware      of    the     fact   that      the        position        he    occupied     was\n\ntransitory,” the Court concluded that “[a] simple offer of\n\na permanent position without any action on the part of the\n\ngovernment agency clearly showing an agreement to make good\n\non   the     promise       cannot,        by    itself,          give      [an    employee]\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fanything beyond a unilateral expectation of job retention.”\n\nId. at 806.\n\n       The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico’s holding in Correa\n\nclearly    demonstrates       that    Negrón’s      promise     did   not    give\n\nplaintiffs a legitimate claim of entitlement to a permanent\n\ngovernment position under Puerto Rico law.                      See Ruiz-Roche\n\nv. Lausell, 848 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating that a\n\n“naked-and vague-promise” of a permanent position “was not\n\nenough,”    under    Puerto    Rico    law,    to    give   a    plaintiff     “a\n\nlegitimate     expectation     of    continued      employment”       with    the\n\nCommonwealth).        The   agency’s       invitation   to      plaintiffs     to\n\nfill out applications for permanent employment, as alleged\n\nin the complaint, did not indicate the agency’s intent to\n\nmake    good   on   Negrón’s       promise.        Therefore,      plaintiffs’\n\nattempt to distinguish Correa is unavailing.\n\n                                      B.\n\n       We now turn to plaintiffs’ argument that Puerto Rico law\n\ngave    them   a    property    interest      in     notification      of     the\n\nidentity of the candidates selected to fill the permanent\n\npositions for which they applied.              Assuming Puerto Rico law\n\nprovides plaintiffs a procedural right to such notification,\n\nthe    “simple      fact    that     state    law     prescribes       certain\n\nprocedures does not mean that the procedures thereby acquire\n\na federal constitutional dimension.”                Slotnick v. Staviskey,\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f560   F.2d      31,   34   (1st    Cir.    1977).      On    the    contrary,    the\n\nSupreme      Court     has   clearly       held    that     the    “categories    of\n\nsubstance and procedure are distinct.”                        Cleveland Bd. of\n\nEduc. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 541 (1985).                         “‘Property’\n\ncannot     be    defined      by    the    procedures        provided     for    its\n\ndeprivation . . . .”              Id.   Plaintiffs’ allegation that they\n\nwere deprived of a right to a notification procedure related\n\nto their termination thus fails to amount to an allegation\n\nof a property interest protected by the Due Process Clause\n\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n                                          III.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ complaint fails to allege facts sufficient\n\nto    establish       they   possessed      a     constitutionally       protected\n\nproperty interest.           Accordingly, plaintiffs have failed to\n\nassert a “plausible entitlement to relief” under the Due\n\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.                        Rodriguez-Ortiz\n\nv. Margo Caribe, Inc., 490 F.3d 92, 95 (1st Cir. 2007).                          The\n\ndistrict      court,       therefore,      properly       granted      defendants’\n\nmotion to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint for failure to state\n\na claim upon which relief can be granted.

Our review of a Rule 12(b)(6)dismissal is de novo. <i>See </i><i>Diaz-Ramos v. Hyundai Motor Co.,</i> 501 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.2007). \"[W]e, like the district court, must assume the truth of all well-plead facts and give the plaintiff[s] the benefit of all reasonable inferences therefrom.\" <i>Ruiz v. Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp.,</i> 496 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2007). Consequently, we proceed to summarize the facts of this case as they appear in plaintiffs' complaint. <i>See id.</i> at 4.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>From October 1998 to January 2003, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's Administration of Juvenile Institutions (AJI) contracted with Southwest Key Program (Southwest) to run the Ponce Detention and Training School Center for Girls. Plaintiffs served as custody officers or technicians in the Ponce Detention Center during this period. In January 2003, the AJI decided to reassume direct responsibility for the center's operations. On January 17, 2003, Defendant Negrón, who served as the AJI's administrator, came to the center and met with Southwest's employees. At this meeting, Negrón informed Southwest's employees that they would be able to continue working at the center under temporary government appointments. Thereafter, Negrón assured Southwest's employees that they would receive permanent appointments to government positions at the center.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs did receive temporary appointments to their prior positions. These appointments commenced on January 17, 2003, and ended on June 30, 2003. Although plaintiffs did not receive further temporary appointments, they continued working at the center until April 2004. During this interim period, plaintiffs applied for permanent government positions with the AJI. Despite Defendant Negrón's promise that they would receive permanent government positions at the center, plaintiffs were terminated on April 30, 2004.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that Defendant Negrón's promise gave them a legitimate claim of entitlement to permanent government employment under Puerto Rico law. In addition, plaintiffs claim a right, under Commonwealth law, to notification of the identities of the individuals who were ultimately placed in the permanent positions for which they applied. Plaintiffs claim that the Commonwealth's failure to grant them permanent positions of employment at the center, or notify them of the identity of the individuals selected to replace them, amounts to a procedural and substantive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must establish \"a plausible entitlement to relief.\" <i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1967, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Plaintiffs claim the Commonwealth violated their rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In order to state a valid claim for a procedural or substantive violation of the Due Process Clause, plaintiffs must \"exhibit a constitutionally protected interest in life, liberty, or property.\" <i>Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio,</i> 406 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2005). In this case, plaintiffs assert a violation of their \"proprietary rights.\" Property interests are created and defined by \"existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\"<sup>[1]</sup><i>Hatfield-Bermudez v. Aldanondo-Rivera,</i> 496 F.3d 51, 59 (1st Cir.2007). In order to qualify as a property interest, state law must give an \"individual a legitimate claim of entitlement to some sort of benefit.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>We first address plaintiffs' claim that Negrón's promise gave them a property interest in a permanent position of government employment. Puerto Rico law provides for the appointment of temporary or \"transitory employees.\" <i>Dept. of Natural Res. v. Correa,</i> 18 P.R. Offic. Trans. 795, 801 (1987). A transitory employee does not have a \"legitimate job retention expectancy once his appointment expires.\" <i>Id.</i> at 804. The question in this case is whether Negrón's promise effectively altered the status quo. <i>See id.</i> (inquiring whether a transitory government employee's \"particular circumstances\" gave him \"a legitimate expectancy of continuity\" in his job).</p>\n<p>In <i>Correa,</i> the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico answered this question. In that case, the Court found an employee who was given several temporary appointments, as well as a promise of permanent employment, did not have a legitimate expectation of continued employment with a government agency. <i>See id.</i> at 805-06. Reasoning the employee was \"aware of the fact that the position he occupied was transitory,\" the Court concluded that \"[a] simple offer of a permanent position without any action on the part of the government agency clearly showing an agreement to make good on the promise cannot, by itself, give [an employee] anything beyond a unilateral expectation of job retention.\" <i>Id.</i> at 806.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's holding in <i>Correa</i> clearly demonstrates that Negrón's promise did not give plaintiffs a legitimate claim of entitlement to a permanent government position under Puerto Rico law. <i>See </i><i>Ruiz-Roche v. Lausell,</i> 848 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1988) (stating that a \"naked-and vague-promise\" of a permanent position \"was not enough,\" under Puerto Rico law, to give a plaintiff \"a legitimate expectation of continued employment\" with the Commonwealth). The agency's invitation to plaintiffs to fill out applications for permanent employment, as alleged in the complaint, did not indicate the agency's intent to make good on Negrón's promise. Therefore, plaintiffs' attempt to distinguish <i>Correa</i> is unavailing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>We now turn to plaintiffs' argument that Puerto Rico law gave them a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> property interest in notification of the identity of the candidates selected to fill the permanent positions for which they applied. Assuming Puerto Rico law provides plaintiffs a procedural right to such notification, the \"simple fact that state law prescribes certain procedures does not mean that the procedures thereby acquire a federal constitutional dimension.\" <i>Slotnick v. Staviskey,</i> 560 F.2d 31, 34 (1st Cir.1977). On the contrary, the Supreme Court has clearly held that the \"categories of substance and procedure are distinct.\" <i>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. 532, 541, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985). \"`Property' cannot be defined by the procedures provided for its deprivation. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> Plaintiffs' allegation that they were deprived of a right to a notification procedure related to their termination thus fails to amount to an allegation of a property interest protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs' complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to establish they possessed a constitutionally protected property interest.

Consequently, we proceed to summarize the facts of this case as they appear in plaintiffs' complaint. <i>See id.</i> at 4.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>From October 1998 to January 2003, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's Administration of Juvenile Institutions (AJI) contracted with Southwest Key Program (Southwest) to run the Ponce Detention and Training School Center for Girls. Plaintiffs served as custody officers or technicians in the Ponce Detention Center during this period. In January 2003, the AJI decided to reassume direct responsibility for the center's operations. On January 17, 2003, Defendant Negrón, who served as the AJI's administrator, came to the center and met with Southwest's employees. At this meeting, Negrón informed Southwest's employees that they would be able to continue working at the center under temporary government appointments. Thereafter, Negrón assured Southwest's employees that they would receive permanent appointments to government positions at the center.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs did receive temporary appointments to their prior positions. These appointments commenced on January 17, 2003, and ended on June 30, 2003. Although plaintiffs did not receive further temporary appointments, they continued working at the center until April 2004. During this interim period, plaintiffs applied for permanent government positions with the AJI. Despite Defendant Negrón's promise that they would receive permanent government positions at the center, plaintiffs were terminated on April 30, 2004.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that Defendant Negrón's promise gave them a legitimate claim of entitlement to permanent government employment under Puerto Rico law. In addition, plaintiffs claim a right, under Commonwealth law, to notification of the identities of the individuals who were ultimately placed in the permanent positions for which they applied. Plaintiffs claim that the Commonwealth's failure to grant them permanent positions of employment at the center, or notify them of the identity of the individuals selected to replace them, amounts to a procedural and substantive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must establish \"a plausible entitlement to relief.\" <i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1955</span></a></span>, 1967, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></a></span> (2007). Plaintiffs claim the Commonwealth violated their rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In order to state a valid claim for a procedural or substantive violation of the Due Process Clause, plaintiffs must \"exhibit a constitutionally protected interest in life, liberty, or property.\" <i>Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201545\"><a href=\"/opinion/201545/centro-medico-del-v-feliciano-de-melecio/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.2005). In this case, plaintiffs assert a violation of their \"proprietary rights.\" Property interests are created and defined by \"existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\"<sup>[1]</sup><i>Hatfield-Bermudez v. Aldanondo-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1454041\"><a href=\"/opinion/1454041/hatfield-bermudez-v-aldanondo-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 59 (1st Cir.2007). In order to qualify as a property interest, state law must give an \"individual a legitimate claim of entitlement to some sort of benefit.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>We first address plaintiffs' claim that Negrón's promise gave them a property interest in a permanent position of government employment. Puerto Rico law provides for the appointment of temporary or \"transitory employees.\" <i>Dept. of Natural Res. v. Correa,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></span>, 801 (1987). A transitory employee does not have a \"legitimate job retention expectancy once his appointment expires.\" <i>Id.</i> at 804. The question in this case is whether Negrón's promise effectively altered the status quo. <i>See id.</i> (inquiring whether a transitory government employee's \"particular circumstances\" gave him \"a legitimate expectancy of continuity\" in his job).</p>\n<p>In <i>Correa,</i> the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico answered this question. In that case, the Court found an employee who was given several temporary appointments, as well as a promise of permanent employment, did not have a legitimate expectation of continued employment with a government agency. <i>See id.</i> at 805-06. Reasoning the employee was \"aware of the fact that the position he occupied was transitory,\" the Court concluded that \"[a] simple offer of a permanent position without any action on the part of the government agency clearly showing an agreement to make good on the promise cannot, by itself, give [an employee] anything beyond a unilateral expectation of job retention.\" <i>Id.</i> at 806.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's holding in <i>Correa</i> clearly demonstrates that Negrón's promise did not give plaintiffs a legitimate claim of entitlement to a permanent government position under Puerto Rico law. <i>See </i><i>Ruiz-Roche v. Lausell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506665\"><a href=\"/opinion/506665/ramon-ruiz-roche-v-miguel-d-lausell-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1988) (stating that a \"naked-and vague-promise\" of a permanent position \"was not enough,\" under Puerto Rico law, to give a plaintiff \"a legitimate expectation of continued employment\" with the Commonwealth).
