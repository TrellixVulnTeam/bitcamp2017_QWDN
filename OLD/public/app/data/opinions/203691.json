Kromm, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellant.\n     James B. Krasnoo, by appointment of the court, with whom\nKrasnoo/Klehm LLP was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          February 24, 2009\n\f               Per Curiam.           In this appeal, the government challenges\n\nthe district court's dismissal with prejudice--for violations of\n\nthe Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161 (2006)--of its four-count\n\nindictment against Earl Dessesaure.                   The prosecutor       concedes that\n\nthe statute was violated, but says that government error was\n\ninadvertent         and   caused      only   a   modest   delay      and   no    harm,    so\n\ndismissal should have been without prejudice.                          The background,\n\nelaborated in the cited decisions, can be briefly summarized.\n\n               On    June       4,   2003,   Dessesaure       was    indicted    on   drug\n\ntrafficking and gun charges.1                He was arrested on the street with\n\ndrugs; the police entered his apartment without a warrant and found\n\nmore drugs in sight; and, obtaining a warrant, agents then made a\n\ndetailed search and seized a gun, bullets, more drugs and drug\n\nparaphernalia, money, and relevant documents.                        After hearings in\n\nfall       2003,    the   district      court    on   April    13,    2004,     granted    a\n\nsuppression motion as to the evidence seized from the apartment.\n\nUnited States v. Dessesaure, 314 F. Supp. 2d 81 (D. Mass. 2004).\n\n               After failing to win reconsideration, United States v.\n\nDessesaure, 323 F. Supp. 2d 211 (D. Mass. 2004), the government\n\nsought       review,      and    this   court    reversed      the    district    court's\n\ndecision to suppress the evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant,\n\n\n       1\n      Specifically, being a felon in possession of ammunition, 18\nU.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (2006) (Count One); possession of heroin with\nintent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) (2006) (Counts Two and\nThree); and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug\ntrafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) (Count Four).\n\n                                             -2-\n\fruling that it was admissible under the analysis set forth by the\n\nSupreme Court in Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978) and Murray\n\nv.   United    States,   487    U.S.   533   (1988).   United   States    v.\n\nDessesaure, 429 F.3d 359, 365 (1st Cir. 2005).         The mandate issued\n\nMarch 7, 2006.     Nothing more happened until June 6, 2006--a period\n\nof ninety-one days--when Dessesaure filed a letter requesting the\n\nappointment of counsel to file a petition for certiorari.\n\n              On June 14, 2006, the district court scheduled a status\n\nconference for June 29.        There, the district judge questioned, sua\n\nsponte, whether the delay violated the Speedy Trial Act.                 The\n\ngovernment's filing on July 14 conceded that a violation had\n\noccurred and urged a dismissal without prejudice.           Dessesaure's\n\ncounsel responded on August 8, 2006, saying he would move for\n\ndismissal with prejudice, although he did not then do so for a\n\nnumber of months.\n\n              On October 27, 2006, the district court held a hearing on\n\nthe Speedy Trial Act issue, observing that it could pursue any of\n\nseveral options; that it was \"tempted to dismiss with prejudice\";\n\nbut that \"most of these dismissals with prejudice are overturned.\"\n\nThe court continued:\n\n              Given the state of the law, the odds are that\n              I would be reversed, even though I strongly\n              believe this is a case with misconduct, and\n              this kind of fact-finding ought to be\n              dismissed with prejudice . . . .\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f            Dessesaure formally moved for dismissal with prejudice on\n\nDecember 18, 2006.      Eleven months later, on November 21, 2007, the\n\ndistrict court dismissed the indictment against Dessesaure \"with\n\nprejudice.\"    United States v. Dessesaure, 527 F. Supp. 2d 193 (D.\n\nMass. 2007).        The district court agreed that the crimes were\n\n\"extremely serious\" and that delay had been partly due to the court\n\nitself, but said that the prosecution had \"been flawed . . . in\n\nmany respects\" and the defendant had languished in jail for too\n\nlong.    Id. at 198.\n\n            The     government    now     appeals       and,    neither      facts   nor\n\ngoverning law being seriously in dispute, our review is for \"abuse\n\nof discretion.\"      United States v. Kelley, 402 F.3d 39, 41 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).     The issue is framed by the statutory scheme, a set of\n\nfactors that the law makes relevant to choosing a remedy, and a\n\npattern of case law that--as the district judge recognized--makes\n\ndismissal    with    prejudice     a    last     and    rare    resort.       Sansone,\n\nAnnotation, 98 A.L.R. Fed. 660 (1990) (collecting case law on\n\ndismissal with prejudice under the statute).\n\n            The reason why such dismissals are ordinarily without\n\nprejudice is obvious.      The Speedy Trial Act is a mechanical regime\n\nwhich, nominally, requires trial within 70 days of indictment but\n\nexcludes    various    periods     from    the    calculation.          18    U.S.C.   §\n\n3161(c)(1),    (h).      For     the    sake    of     both    the   public    and   the\n\ndefendant, it aims at prompt resolution of criminal charges; but it\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fwould not long survive if administered to turn routine slips into\n\npermanent immunity for a defendant who may be quite dangerous.\n\n          Given a violation, the statute and precedent require the\n\ncourt to consider various factors.   The statute itself provides:\n\n          In determining whether to dismiss the case\n          with or without prejudice, the court shall\n          consider, among others, each of the following\n          factors: the seriousness of the offense; the\n          facts and circumstances of the case which led\n          to the dismissal; and the impact of a\n          reprosecution on the administration of this\n          chapter and on the administration of justice.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3162(a)(2).\n\n          Perhaps the most concrete elements are the seriousness of\n\nthe offense, the cause of the delay and any resulting prejudice to\n\nthe defendant's ability to get a fair trial if re-prosecuted.    18\n\nU.S.C. § 3162(a)(2); United States v. Scott, 270 F.3d 30, 58 (1st\n\nCir. 2001); United States v. Hastings, 847 F.2d 920, 925-29 (1st\n\nCir. 1988). Here, all three of these factors supported a dismissal\n\nwithout prejudice as the fit remedy.\n\n          Of the offenses charged, little need be said because\n\ntheir seriousness is so obvious.   Hastings, 847 F.2d at 925.   The\n\ncombination of drug trafficking and guns has imposed a grim toll on\n\nsociety. If the evidence seized at Dessesaure's apartment is taken\n\nat face value--and he has not yet had a chance to defend himself at\n\ntrial--it explains why he did not press vigorously for an early\n\ntrial and makes a showing of prejudice more doubtful.\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f           The initial delay complained of by the district judge was\n\nthe failure to press the case forward between the issuance of this\n\ncourt's mandate in March 2006 and the conference in June; but the\n\ndelay was not especially long, and the defendant was as well-placed\n\nto remind the judge as was the prosecutor.         The delay between this\n\ncourt's decision and the issuance of mandate was due to a defense\n\npetition   for    rehearing   en   banc    which      was   legitimate   but\n\nautomatically stayed issuance of the mandate.\n\n           By the time the district court dismissed the case, the\n\nduration   had   become   substantial,    but   not    because   of   further\n\nprosecution delay.    The defense, for example, said in August 2006\n\nthat it would seek dismissal with prejudice but delayed moving\n\nuntil December.     The district judge then considered the ensuing\n\nmotion to dismiss for eleven months.       On the present facts neither\n\nconsideration supports a dismissal with prejudice.\n\n           Ordinarily, the strongest argument against re-prosecution\n\nis prejudice to the defendant--most importantly, loss of witnesses\n\nor other impediments to obtaining a fair trial at a later date. See\n\nScott, 270 F.3d at 58; United States v. Barnes, 159 F.3d 4, 18 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).   But Dessesaure has not made any showing of this kind.\n\nFurther, if he were re-indicted and could prove real prejudice, he\n\ncould invoke a constitutional guarantee, which operates to protect\n\nagainst such prejudice regardless of the Speedy Trial Act.               See\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fU.S. Const. amend. VI; United States v. Mitchell, 723 F.2d 1040,\n\n1049 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\n           The district court made clear its view that the case was\n\nflawed from the outset because the original entry into Dessesaure's\n\napartment was unlawful; but the prosecution was entitled to try to\n\nrescue the case under Supreme Court precedent, and it prevailed on\n\nthe appeal.   Dessesaure, 429 F.3d at 367.   Of greater concern is\n\nthe district court's finding that Boston police officers did not\n\ntestify truthfully in the suppression hearing; but there is no\n\nindication that federal prosecutors were parties to the deceit nor\n\nis it clear that any inaccuracies in testimony had anything to do\n\nwith the Speedy Trial Act violations.    See Hastings, 847 F.2d at\n\n925-26.\n\n           The judgment of dismissal without prejudice is reversed\n\nand the case remanded for entry of judgment of dismissal without\n\nprejudice which must be done within seven days of issuance of our\n\nmandate.   Our mandate shall issue forthwith.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f",

The statute itself provides:\n\n          In determining whether to dismiss the case\n          with or without prejudice, the court shall\n          consider, among others, each of the following\n          factors: the seriousness of the offense; the\n          facts and circumstances of the case which led\n          to the dismissal; and the impact of a\n          reprosecution on the administration of this\n          chapter and on the administration of justice.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3162(a)(2).\n\n          Perhaps the most concrete elements are the seriousness of\n\nthe offense, the cause of the delay and any resulting prejudice to\n\nthe defendant's ability to get a fair trial if re-prosecuted.    18\n\nU.S.C. § 3162(a)(2); United States v. Scott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775404\"><a href=\"/opinion/775404/united-states-v-alan-n-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58 (1st\n\nCir. 2001); United States v. Hastings, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506587\"><a href=\"/opinion/506587/united-states-v-kenneth-s-hastings/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 925-29 (1st\n\nCir. 1988). Here, all three of these factors supported a dismissal\n\nwithout prejudice as the fit remedy.\n\n          Of the offenses charged, little need be said because\n\ntheir seriousness is so obvious.   Hastings, 847 F.2d at 925.   The\n\ncombination of drug trafficking and guns has imposed a grim toll on\n\nsociety. If the evidence seized at Dessesaure's apartment is taken\n\nat face value--and he has not yet had a chance to defend himself at\n\ntrial--it explains why he did not press vigorously for an early\n\ntrial and makes a showing of prejudice more doubtful.\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f           The initial delay complained of by the district judge was\n\nthe failure to press the case forward between the issuance of this\n\ncourt's mandate in March 2006 and the conference in June; but the\n\ndelay was not especially long, and the defendant was as well-placed\n\nto remind the judge as was the prosecutor.         The delay between this\n\ncourt's decision and the issuance of mandate was due to a defense\n\npetition   for    rehearing   en   banc    which      was   legitimate   but\n\nautomatically stayed issuance of the mandate.\n\n           By the time the district court dismissed the case, the\n\nduration   had   become   substantial,    but   not    because   of   further\n\nprosecution delay.    The defense, for example, said in August 2006\n\nthat it would seek dismissal with prejudice but delayed moving\n\nuntil December.     The district judge then considered the ensuing\n\nmotion to dismiss for eleven months.       On the present facts neither\n\nconsideration supports a dismissal with prejudice.\n\n           Ordinarily, the strongest argument against re-prosecution\n\nis prejudice to the defendant--most importantly, loss of witnesses\n\nor other impediments to obtaining a fair trial at a later date. See\n\nScott, 270 F.3d at 58; United States v. Barnes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198181\"><a href=\"/opinion/198181/united-states-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).   But Dessesaure has not made any showing of this kind.\n\nFurther, if he were re-indicted and could prove real prejudice, he\n\ncould invoke a constitutional guarantee, which operates to protect\n\nagainst such prejudice regardless of the Speedy Trial Act.               See\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fU.S. Const. amend. VI; United States v. Mitchell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"429195\"><a href=\"/opinion/429195/united-states-v-mark-a-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1049 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\n           The district court made clear its view that the case was\n\nflawed from the outset because the original entry into Dessesaure's\n\napartment was unlawful; but the prosecution was entitled to try to\n\nrescue the case under Supreme Court precedent, and it prevailed on\n\nthe appeal.   Dessesaure, 429 F.3d at 367.   Of greater concern is\n\nthe district court's finding that Boston police officers did not\n\ntestify truthfully in the suppression hearing; but there is no\n\nindication that federal prosecutors were parties to the deceit nor\n\nis it clear that any inaccuracies in testimony had anything to do\n\nwith the Speedy Trial Act violations.    See Hastings, 847 F.2d at\n\n925-26.\n\n           The judgment of dismissal without prejudice is reversed\n\nand the case remanded for entry of judgment of dismissal without\n\nprejudice which must be done within seven days of issuance of our\n\nmandate.   Our mandate shall issue forthwith.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f</pre>",
