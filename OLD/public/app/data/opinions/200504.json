We have reviewed the parties' briefs and\n\nthe record on appeal.    We affirm essentially for the reasons\n\nstated in the district court's memorandum of decision, dated\n\nAugust 12, 2002.\n\n          We reject appellant's contention that his habeas\n\npetition was dismissed by the district court without notice and\n\nan opportunity to be heard.       Appellant, in fact, filed an\n\nopposition to the state's motion to dismiss, which the court\n\nconsidered.   Although   appellant   sought   to   file   a   second\n\nresponse to the motion to dismiss, the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in refusing that request.     Further, there\n\nwas no abuse of discretion in denying appellant's motion\n\nseeking an evidentiary hearing.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -2-\n\f",
