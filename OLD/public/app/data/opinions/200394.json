Lagueux, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                      Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Cyr and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Joseph R.

Brian S. Kauch challenges a district court\n\njudgment which dismissed his false-arrest claims against three\n\npolice officers.       See 42 U.S.C. § 1983.       We affirm.\n\n              Pursuant to an extant restraining order entered by the\n\nFamily Court, Kauch was entitled to visit with his children each\n\nWednesday from 4:00 to 8:00 p.m., every other weekend, and on\n\nadditional occasions mutually agreeable to Kauch and his ex-wife,\n\nJoan Berrigan.      On June 14, 2000 — a Wednesday — the Family Court\n\nentered an order restraining Kauch from further contact with\n\nBerrigan, while preserving his extant child-visitation rights.\n\nShortly after Kauch telephoned Berrigan at her residence that same\n\nevening, he was arrested for violating the no-contact order.\n\n              On appeal, Kauch contests the qualified-immunity defenses\n\nasserted by the three arresting officers pursuant to section 1983.\n\nFirst,   he    maintains    that   the    defendant   officers   unreasonably\n\nunderstood that any contact he had with Berrigan, no matter how\n\ninnocuous, would violate the restraining order.                  See State v.\n\nConti,   672    A.2d   885,   886-87      (R.I.   1996)   (noting    that   mere\n\ncoincidental contacts are not violative of no-contact order).\n\nThus, in effect Kauch would have police officers determine the\n\nnuances of criminal complaints prior to making an arrest.\n\n              On the contrary, the “[p]olice are afforded immunity\n\n[from § 1983 actions for damages] ‘so long as the presence of\n\nprobable cause [to arrest] is at least arguable.’”                  Fletcher v.\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fTown of Clinton, 196 F.3d 41, 53 (1st Cir. 1999) (emphasis added;\n\ncitation omitted).           The   defendants     were    aware    both    that   the\n\nrestraining    order   explicitly      prohibited        Kauch    from    contacting\n\nBerrigan at home, and that Berrigan had filed a complaint asserting\n\nthat Kauch had contacted her at home.             Further, even assuming that\n\nthe defendant policemen had been aware of it, the Conti case is at\n\nleast arguably distinguishable, in that it involved chance public\n\nencounters, rather than a targeted telephone communication to the\n\nprivate residence of the protected party.\n\n          Second, Kauch contends that had the restraining order\n\nbeen reviewed with care by the defendants beforehand, they would\n\nhave discovered that it excepted contacts necessary to arrange for\n\nthe authorized child visitations.            Be that as it may, once the\n\npolice possess an evidentiary foundation sufficient to establish\n\nprobable cause to arrest, they are not required to investigate\n\nfurther   in   order    to     rule   out    all    conceivable          alternative\n\nexplanations. See United States v. Bonilla Romero, 836 F.2d 39, 46\n\n(1st Cir. 1987); see also Kelley v. Myler, 149 F.3d 641, 646-47\n\n(7th Cir. 1998).\n\n          Finally, the instant restraining order arguably contains\n\nno such exception, in that it simply permitted “visitation as\n\n[previously] ordered.”         Thus, it would be entirely reasonable to\n\ninfer that Kauch was still entitled to the regularly-scheduled\n\nvisitations    with    his    children   —   on    Wednesdays      and     alternate\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fweekends — which visitations would not require contact between him\n\nand Berrigan, and that he simply was no longer entitled to contact\n\nBerrigan to arrange for any visitations other than the regularly-\n\nscheduled ones.\n\n            Accordingly,   the   district   court   judgment   must   be\n\naffirmed.    See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
