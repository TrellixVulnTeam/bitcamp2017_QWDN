We have carefully reviewed the record\n                      \n\nin  this case  and  are  of the  opinion  that the  contested\n\ndistrict  court findings --  i.e., (1) that  defendant easily\n\nmet  its  burden  of demonstrating  that  plaintiff  had made\n\nmaterial misrepresentations during the course of  defendant's\n\ninvestigation of the fire underlying this litigation; and (2)\n\nthat  defendant easily met  its burden of  demonstrating that\n\nplaintiff had engaged  in fraudulent conduct relating  to the\n\nfire -- are amply supported.  Thus, because each such finding\n\nrelieved defendant  of  liability under  the  fire  insurance\n\npolicy issued  by defendant to  plaintiff, the court  did not\n\nerr in entering judgment in  favor of defendant on all counts\n\nset forth in plaintiff's complaint.\n\n          Furthermore, we agree with  the district court that\n\nthis case is one  of those very rare instances  where a shift\n\nin attorneys' fees pursuant to the inherent  authority of the\n\ndistrict court, see  Jones v. Winnepesaukee Realty,  990 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1, 4  (1st Cir. 1993) (\"It  is beyond serious  dispute that a\n\nfederal  court possesses  inherent power to  shift attorneys'\n\nfees  when parties  conduct litigation  in  bad faith.\"),  is\n\nappropriate.1    The  record is  replete  with  evidence that\n\nplaintiff and several  of his witnesses, both  prior to trial\n\n                    \n\n1.  Because we find  the court's fee-shifting sanction  to be\nappropriate  in both  substance and  amount  pursuant to  the\ncourt's inherent  authority, we  need not  and do not  decide\nwhether the sanction  also was authorized by Fed.

This\n\ntestimony alone,  in the context of this  case, is sufficient\n\nto support  the sanction imposed.   Therefore, the  court did\n\nnot  err in granting defendant's motion for sanctions against\n\nplaintiff.  \n\n          Finally,  we agree with  the district court  in its\n\ncharacterization  of this  litigation by  plaintiff as  truly\n\ndeplorable.\n\n          Accordingly,  we  summarily affirm  the  challenged\n\norders of the district court.
