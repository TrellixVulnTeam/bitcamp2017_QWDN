Mack, Senior Litigation Counsel,\nand Mary Jane Candaux, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of\nImmigration Litigation, Civil Division, Department of Justice, on\nbrief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                           May 4, 2007\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge.            Mahmed Mahmoud, a native and\n\ncitizen of Egypt, entered the United States on June 12, 2001, as a\n\nnon-immigrant visitor authorized to remain until December 11, 2001.\n\nHe failed to leave by that date.          In October 2003, Mahmoud conceded\n\nin removal proceedings that he was subject to removal, but he\n\nrequested   voluntary     departure.        The    immigration       judge   (\"IJ\")\n\ngranted Mahmoud's request, so long as he departed on or before\n\nFebruary 11, 2004, or within any extension granted to him.\n\n            In late December 2003, after consulting an immigration\n\nattorney, Mahmoud married Gloria Maldonado.                   Within a few days,\n\nMaldonado submitted a request for an immigrant visa for Mahmoud and\n\nin January 2004, Mahmoud moved to reopen his removal proceedings\n\nand adjust his status.      The IJ promptly denied relief with a brief\n\nexplanation; Mahmoud sought review; and the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals remanded, asking the IJ to explain further the reasons for\n\nher denial.\n\n            On   December   2,    2004,    the    IJ    ruled     that,   given    the\n\nsequence    of   events   described       above,       it   was   \"unlikely\"      that\n\nMahmoud's marriage was bona fide--a condition for adjustment of\n\nstatus in this case, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(e) (2000)--and in any event\n\nadjustment remained a discretionary decision and the circumstances\n\ndid not warrant relief.          The IJ noted that Mahmoud had presented\n\nlittle evidence of favorable equities, and suggested that Mahmoud's\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\factions \"constitute[d] a delay tactic and a disregard for the final\n\norder that [Mahmoud] requested.\"\n\n            Mahmoud appealed this decision to the Board in January\n\n2005. While that motion was pending, United States Citizenship and\n\nImmigration Services, an agency within the Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity,1 approved Maldonado's visa petition on behalf of Mahmoud,\n\nwho then filed with the Board a motion to remand, arguing that the\n\napproval of his petition supported his claim that his marriage was\n\nbona fide and that he was eligible for adjustment of status.\n\n            Acting by a single member, the Board affirmed the IJ's\n\ndenial of Mahmoud's motion to reopen and denied his motion to\n\nremand. As to reopening, the Board agreed with the IJ that Mahmoud\n\nwas   not   entitled   to   favorable    discretionary   action    on   his\n\napplication to adjust status.     The motion to remand, it found, was\n\nin effect a motion to reopen and was accordingly numerically and\n\ntime-barred.    8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A), 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).      The Board added that, if not thus barred,\n\nMahmoud’s    failure   to   voluntarily    depart   as   earlier   ordered\n\nprecluded adjustment of status.     8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d).\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      In 2003, functions of the former INS were transferred to the\nnewly formed Department of Homeland Security and divided into three\nseparate agencies, including United States Citizenship and\nImmigration   Services;   the   Attorney   General   retained   the\nadjudicative and discretionary functions exercised through the IJs\nand the Board. See Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-\n296, 116 Stat. 2135 (2002).\n\n                                   -3-\n\f            Mahmoud now seeks review in this court, arguing that the\n\nIJ and Board erred both in substance and procedurally, denying him\n\ndue process.     The government responds that to the extent Mahmoud\n\npreserved    claims,    they      relate      to   factual    or   discretionary\n\ndeterminations by the IJ and the Board as to which judicial review\n\nis precluded by statute, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B), namely,\n\nwhether Mahmoud entered into a bona fide marriage and whether a\n\ndiscretionary adjustment of status should be allowed.\n\n            Because of rapid successive amendments, the immigration\n\nstatutes are now an archeological dig in which layer upon layer of\n\nprovisions, often with different effective dates, must be excavated\n\nto   determine   what   is   or    is   not    reviewable.2        Ever   changing\n\nsubstantive law, including new regulations and court glosses, adds\n\nfurther complications.         The result, although partly due to real\n\nworld conditions and inherent complexities of the subject, is a\n\nmaze of confusion.\n\n            In this case, we can bypass the arguments as to just what\n\nis or is not reviewable and whether special restrictive standards\n\napply to review, because the IJ and the Board would be upheld even\n\nif everything was reviewable under ordinary administrative law\n\nstandards and none of the special restrictions applied.                    A vast\n\n\n      2\n      E.g., REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, div. B, 119\nStat. 231 (2005); Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\nResponsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, div. C, 110 Stat.\n3009 (1996); Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996,\nPub. L. No. 104-132, tit. IV, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996).\n\n                                        -4-\n\fnumber   of    cases   turn   on   whether   someone    is   entitled   to   be\n\nconsidered for discretionary relief; here, discretionary relief was\n\nconsidered and was denied.\n\n              Because of perceived abuses, Congress by statute and the\n\nAttorney General by regulation have sought to prevent applicants\n\nfrom using marriages to U.S. citizens as a means of avoiding normal\n\nvisa requirements or of frustrating removal proceedings against one\n\nwho has overstayed his visa. Immigration Marriage Fraud Amendments\n\nof 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-639, 100 Stat. 3537 (1986); see also 8\n\nC.F.R. § 216.3(b).      Pertinently, if it were found that Mahmoud had\n\nin fact entered into this marriage simply to defeat removal, he\n\nwould be ineligible for an adjustment of status from removable\n\nalien to permanent resident.        8 U.S.C. § 1255(e).\n\n              However, even if the marriage did not disqualify Mahmoud,\n\nthe decision whether to grant an adjustment of status is still a\n\ndiscretionary decision, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a); where the request for\n\nadjustment of status is made by one like Mahmoud already in removal\n\nproceedings, the IJ presiding over the removal proceeding exercises\n\nthat discretion.       8 C.F.R. § 1245.2(a)(1).        In this instance, the\n\nIJ expressed doubt whether this was a bona fide marriage but also\n\ndenied relief as a matter of discretion.\n\n              Here, the IJ made clear that the outcome would be the\n\nsame even if she ignored her doubts as to whether the marriage was\n\nmore than a device to frustrate the order of removal.           The IJ noted\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fMahmoud's unconditional agreement to voluntarily depart (which he\n\nfailed to do without securing an extension), the eve-of-departure\n\nmarriage, and the lack of any evidence from Mahmoud \"to show\n\nhardship or humanitarian concerns beyond the mere act of marriage\n\nitself\" such as \"a U.S. citizen child.\"\n\n           Even if Congress had not limited review of factual and\n\ndiscretionary    determinations,     this       is   a   perfectly   rational\n\nexplanation rooted in the record.           Judgments about equities and\n\nlast   minute   requests   for   relief   and    about   the   importance   of\n\nvoluntary departure agreements are exactly the kind of factors that\n\none would expect a decision-maker to consider. See generally In re\n\nVelarde, 23 I. & N. Dec. 253, 256 (BIA 2002).                  Nothing in the\n\noutcome is surprising--let alone irrational or arbitrary.\n\n           Mahmoud was, of course, provided an opportunity to point\n\nto discretionary factors in his favor, but he says that he was\n\nentitled as a matter of due process to an evidentiary hearing on\n\nhis motion to reopen to adjust status.               No such constitutional\n\nclaim was presented to the Board; in his second appeal, Mahmoud\n\nsimply argued that the failure to provide such a hearing was an\n\nabuse of discretion.        This likely ends the matter because an\n\nunexhausted claim is ordinarily not preserved for review. 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(d)(1).\n\n           In all events, Mahmoud apparently made no proffer to the\n\nIJ--and certainly has not pointed us to such a proffer--as to\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fspecific evidence that he would have offered as to discretionary\n\nfactors or equities in support of an adjustment of status.              Absent\n\nsuch a showing, there is no plausible due process or abuse of\n\ndiscretion claim. See Morales-Izquierdo v. Gonzales, 477 F.3d 691,\n\n701 (9th Cir. 2007); cf. Luna v. INS, 709 F.2d 126 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\n          As for Mahmoud's request for a second remand, this\n\nrequest (whether or not procedurally barred) was effectively mooted\n\nby the Board's decision to sustain the discretionary denial of\n\nadjustment   of   status.   Mahmoud      sought   remand   for   the    IJ    to\n\nreconsider whether the grant of the visa application by a different\n\nagency supported the claim that the marriage was bona fide.             But in\n\ndenying discretionary relief, the IJ ruled that the denial did not\n\ndepend on whether the marriage was bona fide.\n\n          Finally,    Mahmoud   argues    that    \"systemic   malaise\"       has\n\ninfected the review process for immigration cases, and that this\n\nmalaise resulted in a predisposition to deny his claim and a\n\nviolation of his due process rights.              Again, Mahmoud did not\n\npresent this claim to the Board; but there is no evidence that the\n\nIJ or the Board was biased or unserious about review.                  Mahmoud\n\nhimself got fair consideration of his claim, including one remand\n\nfor further proceedings and an explicit explanation for the denial\n\nof discretionary relief.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f",

He failed to leave by that date. In October 2003, Mahmoud conceded in removal proceedings that he was subject to removal, but he requested voluntary departure. The immigration judge (\"IJ\") granted Mahmoud's request, so long as he departed on or before February 11, 2004, or within any extension granted to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late December 2003, after consulting an immigration attorney, Mahmoud married Gloria Maldonado. Within a few days, Maldonado submitted a request for an immigrant visa for Mahmoud and in January 2004, Mahmoud moved to reopen his removal proceedings and adjust his status. The IJ promptly denied relief with a brief explanation; Mahmoud sought review; and the Board of Immigration Appeals remanded, asking the IJ to explain further the reasons for her denial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 2, 2004, the IJ ruled that, given the sequence of events described above, it was \"unlikely\" that Mahmoud's marriage was bona fide &#8212; a condition for adjustment of status in this case, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(e) (2000) &#8212; and in any event adjustment remained a discretionary decision and the circumstances did not warrant relief. The IJ noted that Mahmoud had presented little evidence of favorable equities, and suggested that Mahmoud's actions \"constitute[d] a delay tactic and a disregard for the final order that [Mahmoud] requested.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mahmoud appealed this decision to the Board in January 2005. While that motion was pending, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> approved Maldonado's visa petition on behalf of Mahmoud, who then filed with the Board a motion to remand, arguing that the approval of his petition supported his claim that his marriage was bona fide and that he was eligible for adjustment of status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acting by a single member, the Board affirmed the IJ's denial of Mahmoud's motion to reopen and denied his motion to remand. As to reopening, the Board agreed with the IJ that Mahmoud was not entitled to favorable discretionary action on his application to adjust status. The motion to remand, it found, was in effect a motion to reopen and was accordingly numerically and time-barred. 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1229a(c)(7)(A), 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(c)(2). The Board added that, if not thus barred, Mahmoud's failure to voluntarily depart as earlier ordered precluded adjustment of status. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mahmoud now seeks review in this court, arguing that the IJ and Board erred both in substance and procedurally, denying him due process. The government responds that to the extent Mahmoud preserved claims, they relate to factual or discretionary determinations by the IJ and the Board as to which judicial review is precluded by statute, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B), namely, whether Mahmoud entered into a bona fide marriage and whether a discretionary adjustment of status should be allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of rapid successive amendments, the immigration statutes are now an archeological dig in which layer upon layer of provisions, often with different effective dates, must be excavated to determine what is or is not reviewable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Ever changing substantive law, including new regulations and court glosses, adds further complications. The result, although partly due to real world conditions and inherent complexities of the subject, is a maze of confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we can bypass the arguments as to just what is or is not reviewable and whether special restrictive standards apply to review, because the IJ and the Board would be upheld even if everything was reviewable under ordinary administrative law standards and none of the special restrictions applied. A vast number of cases turn on whether someone is <i>entitled</i> to be considered for discretionary relief; here, discretionary relief <i>was</i> considered and was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of perceived abuses, Congress by statute and the Attorney General by regulation have sought to prevent applicants from using marriages to U.S. citizens as a means of avoiding normal visa requirements or of frustrating removal proceedings against one who has overstayed his visa. Immigration Marriage Fraud Amendments of 1986, Pub.L. No. 99-639, 100 Stat. 3537 (1986); <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 216.3(b). Pertinently, if it were found that Mahmoud had in fact entered into this marriage simply to defeat removal, he would be ineligible for an adjustment of status from removable alien to permanent resident. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, even if the marriage did not disqualify Mahmoud, the decision whether to grant an adjustment of status is still a discretionary decision, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a); where the request for adjustment of status is made by one like Mahmoud already in removal proceedings, the IJ presiding over the removal proceeding exercises that discretion. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1245.2(a)(1). In this instance, the IJ expressed doubt whether this was a bona fide marriage but <i>also</i> denied relief as a matter of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the IJ made clear that the outcome would be the same even if she ignored her doubts as to whether the marriage was more than a device to frustrate the order of removal. The IJ noted Mahmoud's unconditional agreement to voluntarily depart (which he failed to do without securing an extension), the eve-of-departure marriage, and the lack of any evidence from Mahmoud \"to show hardship or humanitarian concerns beyond the mere act of marriage itself\" such as \"a U.S. citizen child.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Congress had not limited review of factual and discretionary determinations, this is a perfectly rational explanation rooted in the record. Judgments about equities and last minute requests for relief and about the importance of voluntary departure agreements are exactly the kind of factors that one would expect a decision-maker to consider. <i>See generally In re Velarde,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 253, 256 (BIA 2002). Nothing in the outcome is surprising &#8212; let alone irrational or arbitrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mahmoud was, of course, provided an opportunity to point to discretionary factors in his favor, but he says that he was entitled as a matter of due process to an evidentiary hearing on his motion to reopen to adjust status. No such constitutional claim was presented to the Board; in his second appeal, Mahmoud simply argued that the failure to provide such a hearing was an abuse of discretion. This likely ends the matter because an unexhausted claim is ordinarily not preserved for review. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(d)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, Mahmoud apparently made no proffer to the IJ &#8212; and certainly has not pointed us to such a proffer &#8212; as to specific evidence that he would have offered as to discretionary factors or equities in support of an adjustment of status. Absent such a showing, there is no plausible due process or abuse of discretion claim. <i>See Morales-Izquierdo v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">691</span></span>, 701 (9th Cir.2007); <i>cf. Luna v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"419734\"><a href=\"/opinion/419734/emilio-luna-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">709</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Mahmoud's request for a second remand, this request (whether or not procedurally barred) was effectively mooted by the Board's decision to sustain the discretionary denial of adjustment of status. Mahmoud sought remand for the IJ to reconsider whether the grant of the visa application by a different agency supported the claim that the marriage was bona fide. But in denying discretionary relief, the IJ ruled that the denial did not depend on whether the marriage was bona fide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Mahmoud argues that \"systemic malaise\" has infected the review process for immigration cases, and that this malaise resulted in a predisposition to deny his claim and a violation of his due process rights. Again, Mahmoud did not present this claim to the Board; but there is no evidence that the IJ or the Board was biased or unserious about review. Mahmoud himself got fair consideration of his claim, including one remand for further proceedings and an explicit explanation for the denial of discretionary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In 2003, functions of the former INS were transferred to the newly formed Department of Homeland Security and divided into three separate agencies, including United States Citizenship and Immigration Services; the Attorney General retained the adjudicative and discretionary functions exercised through the IJs and the Board<i>See</i> Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L.
