These are two appeals\n\narising out of a federal habeas corpus petition brought by a state\n\nprisoner.   In the principal appeal, the petitioner — who portrays\n\nherself as a victim of battered woman's syndrome — urges us to\n\nreverse the denial of habeas relief and hold that she lacked\n\ncompetency to stand trial in the state court or, alternatively,\n\nthat she involuntarily waived her right to present a viable theory\n\nof   defense.      In   the   cross-appeal,   the   respondent   (the\n\nsuperintendent of the state correctional facility in which the\n\npetitioner is confined) urges us to revisit the district court's\n\ndeterminations concerning exhaustion of state remedies and the\n\ngranting of a federal evidentiary hearing, as well as to consider\n\na nascent theory of procedural default.       After working our way\n\nthrough a procedural quagmire, examining a mountain of paper, and\n\nstudying a complex set of legal issues, we reject both appeals and\n\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            This case has a lengthy and tortured history.        The\n\nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (the SJC) has accurately\n\nrecounted the evidence presented at the petitioner's trial and in\n\nthe subsequent state court proceedings.    See Commonwealth v. Pike,\n\n726 N.E.2d 940, 942-51 (Mass. 2000) (Pike I).         We assume the\n\nreader's familiarity with that opinion, rehearse here only those\n\ndetails that are directly relevant to our analysis, and amplify\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthat account to reflect evidence presented before the federal\n\nhabeas court.\n\n          In 1995, a Massachusetts jury found the petitioner, Julie\n\nA. Pike, guilty of second-degree murder.        This conviction resulted\n\nfrom the interaction of the petitioner and her swain, Barry Loring,\n\nwith Don Maynard.    As part and parcel of what began as a plan to\n\nsteal a car, Maynard was slain in his Greenfield home.         The murder\n\noccurred in 1994 and suspicion soon centered on Loring and the\n\npetitioner.\n\n          Loring    agreed      to   plead    guilty   and   became    the\n\nCommonwealth's star witness at his former girlfriend's trial.          He\n\nvouchsafed that the pair had broken into Maynard's abode together;\n\nthat they then agreed that Loring would kill Maynard using a gun\n\ndiscovered inside the house; but that, when Maynard returned home\n\nearlier than anticipated, an altercation between the two men\n\nensued.   According to Loring, the petitioner ended the scuffle by\n\nkilling Maynard with a shot to the back of the head.\n\n          In    addition   to   Loring's     eyewitness   testimony,   the\n\nCommonwealth presented substantial physical evidence linking the\n\npetitioner to Maynard's home; evidence that she had fled with\n\nLoring; proof that she had sold some of Maynard's property at a\n\npawn shop; and testimony from Loring's cellmate that tended to\n\ncorroborate Loring's account of the relevant events.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f           The   petitioner   testified   in   her   own   defense.   She\n\nadmitted to her entanglement in the overall events, but maintained\n\nthat she had not been present in the Maynard residence at the time\n\nof the homicide.    Instead — following Loring's instructions — she\n\nhad waited at a nearby bridge.      Thus, the petitioner argued that\n\nher participation was limited to helping Loring clean up after the\n\nmurder and dispose of Maynard's lifeless body.\n\n           At the close of all the evidence, the jury rejected the\n\npetitioner's version and found her guilty of second-degree murder.\n\nThe trial justice sentenced her to life imprisonment.\n\n           During the pendency of the petitioner's direct appeal,\n\nshe moved for a new trial.       See Mass. R. Crim. P. 30(b).         The\n\ngravamen of her motion was that the severely abusive nature of her\n\nrelationship with Loring had allowed him to control her both at the\n\ntime of the murder and thereafter (up to and including the time of\n\ntrial).   She explained that Loring was able to exert dominion over\n\nher after their arrest because the two were detained at the same\n\njail (albeit on different floors), which permitted extraordinary\n\nlevels of contact between them.      In addition, the petitioner had\n\nbeen seven months pregnant at the time of the murder, Loring was\n\nthe father, and he had minimally supervised visits with their\n\ninfant child during his pretrial incarceration.            The petitioner\n\nclaimed that Loring used these visits as leverage against her,\n\nthreatening to harm the child if she did not do his bidding.\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f                 With this predicate in place, the petitioner maintained\n\nthat she was under the spell of Loring's pervasive influence until\n\nafter the trial.          Through that circumstance, he had coerced her\n\ninto giving a fabricated version of the events surrounding the\n\nMaynard homicide.          She proceeded to recant portions of her trial\n\ntestimony.        The petitioner admitted that she had been in the house\n\nprior to Maynard's death but continued to assert that she had not\n\ncommitted the murder.\n\n                 Taking matters a step further, the petitioner maintained\n\nthat       the   combination    of   Loring's    continued     coercion     and   the\n\ncumulative psychological effects of the abuse (amounting to what is\n\ncommonly known as battered woman's syndrome) rendered her incapable\n\nof disclosing the abuse to her attorneys at the time of trial.1                    In\n\nher    view,      both   the   revelation   of   the   abuse    and   her   changed\n\ntestimony qualified as newly discovered evidence. See Commonwealth\n\nv. Grace, 491 N.E.2d 246, 248 (Mass. 1986).                  Furthermore, on her\n\nassessment of the case, this newly discovered evidence would have\n\naffected the outcome of the trial because it would have allowed her\n\n\n       1\n      Battered woman's syndrome has been described as a \"series of\ncommon characteristics that appear in women who are abused\nphysically and psychologically over an extended period of time by\nthe dominant male figure in their lives.\" State v. Kelly, 478 A.2d\n364, 371 (N.J. 1984). One of these characteristics is a type of\nlearned helplessness, through which the woman believes that the\nbatterer has complete control of the relationship and that she\ncannot escape. See United States v. Brown, 891 F. Supp. 1501, 1505\n(D. Kan. 1995). Women suffering from the syndrome often have a\ndifficult time disclosing the abuse; \"it is the nature of [the]\nillness to conceal its existence.\" Id. at 1510.\n\n                                         -6-\n\fto explain that whatever actions she took on the day of Maynard's\n\ndemise were taken under duress (i.e., coerced by Loring).\n\n           The original trial justice had retired, so a different\n\njudicial officer (whom, for ease in exposition, we shall refer to\n\nas the state court motions justice) held a four-day evidentiary\n\nhearing   to   supplement    the   affidavits   and    psychiatric   reports\n\nsubmitted with the petitioner's motion.               The hearing included\n\ntestimony from the petitioner, the therapist who had begun to treat\n\nher, the lawyers who had represented her at trial, and Dr. Prudence\n\nBaxter (an expert on battered woman's syndrome). At the conclusion\n\nof the hearing, the state court motions justice denied the motion\n\nin a strongly-worded opinion.        Commonwealth v. Pike, No. 94-091,\n\nslip op. at 2 (Mass. Super. Ct. Apr. 8, 1998) (unpublished).             We\n\noffer a synopsis of the findings upon which that decision rested.\n\n           While assuming that evidence of battered woman's syndrome\n\ncould in some cases support the granting of a new trial, the state\n\ncourt motions justice found the petitioner's version of events\n\n\"implausible\"    and   her   testimony     \"unreliable,\"   especially   with\n\nrespect to the degree of control that Loring exerted over her\n\nduring their pretrial incarceration. Id. at 13. Specifically, the\n\nstate court justice concluded that \"[w]hile it [was] likely that\n\n[the petitioner] was subjected to some of the described acts [of\n\nabuse], at least up to the point of her incarceration, it [did] not\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\ffollow       that   [she]    meekly   surrendered    to   Loring's    inescapable\n\ncontrol at the time of her trial.\"             Id.\n\n               The petitioner filed motions seeking reconsideration and\n\nleave to expand the record.             See Mass. R. Crim. P. 13(a)(5).        In\n\nconnection therewith, she proffered affidavits from correctional\n\nofficers employed at the jail where she and Loring had been\n\ndetained prior to trial. The state court motions justice summarily\n\ndenied these motions.\n\n               The SJC allowed the petitioner's application for direct\n\nappellate review. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 30(c)(8). It subsequently\n\naffirmed both the conviction and the denial of the petitioner's\n\npost-trial motions.          See Pike I, 726 N.E.2d at 942.          With respect\n\nto     the    new    trial    motion,    the   SJC   confirmed       that,   under\n\nMassachusetts law, evidence of battered women's syndrome could\n\nconstitute newly discovered evidence warranting a new trial.                  Id.\n\nat 948.       Here, however, the petitioner's quest for a new trial was\n\nproperly thwarted because the state court motions justice had made\n\na supportable credibility determination — she simply did not\n\nbelieve that the petitioner suffered from the ravages of the\n\nsyndrome during the period leading up to the trial.                   Id. at 949,\n\n951.    To cinch matters, the SJC held that the motions justice was\n\nnot unreasonable in refusing to consider the additional affidavits.\n\nSee id. at 951.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f              Having been rebuffed by the SJC, the petitioner repaired\n\nto the federal district court and filed a petition for a writ of\n\nhabeas corpus.         See 28 U.S.C. § 2254.        Of her several asserted\n\ngrounds for relief, only two are pertinent here: (i) that battered\n\nwoman's syndrome had rendered her incompetent to stand trial in\n\nstate court and (ii) that her inability to disclose Loring's abuse\n\nto her trial counsel constituted an involuntary waiver of her\n\nconstitutional right to present a defense.\n\n              After some procedural skirmishing (to which we shortly\n\nshall       return),    the     district   court,    without   any   detailed\n\nexplanation, ordered an evidentiary hearing.2 The hearing extended\n\nover eight days.          The petitioner presented much of the same\n\nevidence that she had presented at the state court hearing on her\n\nnew trial motion: her own testimony as to Loring's abuse, other\n\ntestimony and affidavits corroborating the abuse, testimony from\n\none of her lawyers, Dr. Baxter's testimony, and testimony from\n\nvarious therapists.           The respondent (who, for ease of exposition,\n\nwe   shall     call    \"the    Commonwealth\")   produced   several   rebuttal\n\nwitnesses,      including       Loring's   trial    attorney   and   its   own\n\npsychiatric expert.\n\n\n\n\n        2\n      During its four-year odyssey in the district court, the\npetitioner's case was assigned at different times to different\njudges. Rather than matching each ruling with each judge, we take\nan institutional view and refer only to the decisions of the\ndistrict court.\n\n                                        -9-\n\f            At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court,\n\nruling from the bench, denied the petition.               These timely appeals\n\nfollowed.        The    district   court   has    granted      a    certificate      of\n\nappealability as to all issues.            See id. § 2253(c).\n\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n            In    this    case,    appellate     review   is       governed     by   the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub.\n\nL. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214.            The AEDPA permits federal courts\n\nto grant habeas relief after a final state adjudication of a\n\nfederal constitutional claim only if that adjudication:\n\n            (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary\n            to, or involved an unreasonable application\n            of, clearly established Federal law, as\n            determined by the Supreme Court of the United\n            States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was\n            based on an unreasonable determination of the\n            facts in light of the evidence presented in\n            the State court proceeding.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).         This standard applies, however, only to a\n\n\"claim   that     was    adjudicated    on     the    merits       in   State    court\n\nproceedings.\"      Id.    If the federal claim was never addressed by the\n\nstate court, federal review is de novo.              See Fortini v. Murphy, 257\n\nF.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir. 2001) (noting that a federal court \"can\n\nhardly defer to the state court on an issue that the state court\n\ndid not address\").\n\n            In this instance, it is undisputed that the SJC did not\n\naddress either of the petitioner's current claims on the merits.\n\nTo the extent, then, that these claims were properly before the\n\n                                       -10-\n\fdistrict court — more on this later — the district court correctly\n\nsubjected them to de novo review.        The court also correctly\n\nrecognized that the AEDPA sets out a separate and exacting standard\n\napplicable to review of a state court's factual findings.    See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254(e)(1); Sanna v. DiPaolo, 265 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n          As a general matter, the same standards that courts of\n\nappeals use in direct review of criminal convictions apply to\n\nappellate review of the decisions of federal district courts in\n\nstate prisoner habeas cases.   See 2 Steven Alan Childress & Martha\n\nS. Davis, Federal Standards of Review § 13.06, at 13-50 (3d ed.\n\n1999).   These include de novo review of legal issues and of most\n\nmixed questions of fact and law.   See Scarpa v. DuBois, 38 F.3d 1,\n\n9 (1st Cir. 1994).   We say \"most\" because appellate review of mixed\n\nquestions depends, in the last analysis, on the extent to which a\n\nparticular question is fact-dominated or law-dominated.3    See id.;\n\nsee also In re Extradition of Howard, 996 F.2d 1320, 1328 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).\n\n\n\n     3\n      Some courts have indicated that an \"independent review\"\nstandard should guide the evaluation of mixed questions of fact and\nlaw in habeas cases.    See Scarpa, 38 F.3d at 9 n.5 (collecting\ncases); see also 2 Childress & Davis, supra § 13.06, at 13-50. We\ndo not linger over this question because independent review\ninvolves roughly the same tamisage that we have outlined here; that\nis, significant deference to factbound determinations and little or\nno deference to law-based determinations. See United States v.\nTortora, 922 F.2d 880, 882-83 (1st Cir. 1990); see also Scarpa, 38\nF.3d at 9 n.5 (bypassing inquiry for similar reasons).\n\n                                -11-\n\f           When   the     district     court    undertakes   no    independent\n\nfactfinding in a habeas case, we are effectively in the same\n\nposition as the district court vis-à-vis the state court record and\n\nhave the ability to review that record from the same vantage point.\n\nConsequently, the district court's recension of that record will\n\nengender de novo review.         See Breest v. Perrin, 624 F.2d 1112, 1115\n\n(1st Cir. 1980); 2 Childress & Davis, supra § 13.06, at 13-50.\n\nWhen, however, the district court has held an evidentiary hearing\n\nand made new or different findings of fact, those findings are\n\nentitled to significant deference.            See Scarpa, 38 F.3d at 9 n.5;\n\nsee also McNair v. Campbell, 416 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir. 2005);\n\nMcGregor v. Gibson, 248 F.3d 946, 951 (10th Cir. 2001).\n\nIII.   THE HABEAS RECORD\n\n           As a prelude to our analysis of the petitioner's claims,\n\nwe deem it prudent to say something about the factual record that\n\nunderpins our review.      Although a magistrate judge recommended the\n\nopposite course of action, the district court granted a full-scale\n\nevidentiary hearing.       That hearing had no apparent limits.              It\n\nlasted   nearly   twice     as    long   as    the   pertinent    state   court\n\nevidentiary hearing held seven years earlier, covered the same\n\nfactual ground, and involved much of the same evidence.\n\n           Despite this similitude, the district court evaluated the\n\nevidence somewhat differently than had the state court motions\n\njustice.    It took a more flattering view of the petitioner's\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fcredibility and made several factual findings that contradicted\n\nthose of the state court motions justice.             The district court\n\njustified these contrary findings on the ground that, in the course\n\nof the federal evidentiary hearing, its view of the underlying\n\nfacts had been proven by clear and convincing evidence — a standard\n\ndictated by the AEDPA.      See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1).4\n\n            The Commonwealth asseverates that the district court\n\nerred in granting a full-scale evidentiary hearing and beseeches us\n\nto disregard its factual findings.            This is more than empty\n\nrhetoric:     unless   a   state   prisoner   meets   certain   stringent\n\nrequirements, the AEDPA prohibits a federal court from granting an\n\nevidentiary hearing when \"the applicant has failed to develop the\n\nfactual basis of a claim in State court proceedings.\"              Id. §\n\n2254(e)(2).\n\n            Seizing upon this prohibition, the Commonwealth argues\n\nthat the petitioner, in the state courts, failed to develop the\n\nfactual record needed to underbrace her habeas claims.           In this\n\nvein, the Commonwealth notes that, at the state court evidentiary\n\n\n\n     4\n      In the court below, the petitioner argued that the state\ncourt's factual findings were not entitled to a presumption of\ncorrectness because they were unreasonable in light of the evidence\npresented. She based this argument on the notion that AEDPA\nsections 2254(d)(2) and (e)(1) operate in tandem. To support that\nnotion, she cited our opinion in Mastracchio v. Vose, 274 F.3d 590,\n597-98 (1st Cir. 2001). The district court did not accept this\nhypothesis but, before us, the petitioner does not allege any harm\nresulting from the district court's refusal. Consequently, it is\nunnecessary for us to test this hypothesis.\n\n                                   -13-\n\fhearing, the petitioner did not call the lawyers who represented\n\nher at trial5 and elected to submit affidavits in lieu of much of\n\nthe live testimony that she presented at the federal evidentiary\n\nhearing.\n\n           The petitioner rejoins on several fronts.                  First, she\n\nargues that she did not fail to develop the factual basis for her\n\nclaims because the key facts — those pertaining to the abuse and\n\nher consequent inability to disclose that abuse to her trial\n\ncounsel — were presented to the state court (albeit in lesser\n\ndetail).   Thus, a federal evidentiary hearing was not statutorily\n\nprohibited.      Second, she emphasizes that, in interpreting section\n\n2254(e)(2), the Supreme Court has equated the \"failure to develop\"\n\nlanguage   with    \"a    lack   of   diligence,    or    some    greater   fault,\n\nattributable to the prisoner or prisoner's counsel.\"                  Williams v.\n\nTaylor, 529 U.S. 420, 432 (2000).            Such diligence embodies, \"at a\n\nminimum, seek[ing] an evidentiary hearing in state court in the\n\nmanner prescribed by state law.\"          Id. at 437.         Because she sought\n\nand   received    an    evidentiary   hearing     in    the   state   court,   the\n\npetitioner maintains that she satisfied the diligence standard.\n\nThird, the petitioner asserts that the presentation of additional\n\nevidence in the federal court is unimpugnable because, under\n\nprevailing jurisprudence, she had the right to augment the record\n\n\n\n      5\n      The lawyers did testify during the state court hearing, but\nat the Commonwealth's instance.\n\n                                      -14-\n\fon habeas review.       See 1 Randy Hertz & James S. Liebman, Federal\n\nHabeas Corpus Practice and Procedure § 20.2b, at 906 n.21 (5th ed.\n\n2005). And, finally, the petitioner argues that the district court\n\nwas required to grant her request for an evidentiary hearing under\n\nTownsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 312-13 (1963).\n\n           As    a    matter    of    statutory      law,      we    reject    the\n\nCommonwealth's       importunings.      Here,       the    petitioner    adduced\n\nextensive evidence in the state court.          The exact manner in which\n\nshe elected to make the point is less important than the fact that\n\nshe did make the point; her proffer went directly to the merits of\n\nthe claims that she later sought to pursue in the federal court\n\nproceedings.    We conclude, therefore, that the district court was\n\nnot statutorily prohibited from taking evidence on those claims.\n\nSee Bryan v. Mullin, 335 F.3d 1207, 1215 (10th Cir. 2003) (holding\n\nfederal evidentiary hearing not statutorily barred when petitioner\n\nhad sought to develop factual basis for claim in state court);\n\nMatheney   v.   Anderson,      253   F.3d   1025,    1039     (7th   Cir.     2001)\n\n(similar).\n\n           The fact that a federal evidentiary hearing was not\n\nstatutorily barred does not mean that one was required.                        The\n\ndecision to hold the hearing and the scale and scope of it are\n\nsubject to review for abuse of discretion.                See Crooker v. United\n\nStates, 814 F.2d 75, 76 n.1 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f               In this instance, we find the scale and scope of the\n\nhearing problematic.         Federal habeas is a collateral proceeding;\n\nparticularly after AEDPA, it is not intended to provide a forum in\n\nwhich to retry state cases.         See Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 693\n\n(2002).      Consequently, in state prisoner habeas cases in which the\n\napplicant was afforded a full and fair hearing in state court,\n\nfederal evidentiary hearings ought to be the exception, not the\n\nrule.       See Townsend, 372 U.S. at 314; see also 1 Hertz & Liebman,\n\nsupra § 20.1, at 887 n.3 (noting that evidentiary hearings are\n\nallowed in less than 2% of all habeas filings).          Even when such a\n\nhearing is thought desirable, restraint should be the watchword.\n\n               Here, the state court had conducted a full and fair\n\nevidentiary hearing.         Moreover, the federal court's chosen course\n\nof action led to extensive duplication of effort.          When a federal\n\ncourt opts to hold an evidentiary hearing in a state habeas case,\n\nthe prototypical purpose should be to fill a gap in the record or\n\nto supplement the record on a specific point.6         See, e.g., López v.\n\nMassachusetts, 480 F.3d 591, 597 (1st Cir. 2007) (approving grant\n\nof federal evidentiary hearing to supplement petitioner's Brady\n\nclaim); Guidry v. Dretke, 397 F.3d 306, 324 (5th Cir. 2005)\n\n(approving      grant   of   federal   evidentiary   hearing   when   \"gaps,\n\n\n\n        6\n      For example, such hearings are often useful when the federal\nhabeas court is asked to consider a claim based on ineffective\nassistance of state court counsel. See, e.g., Bryan, 335 F.3d at\n1215.\n\n                                       -16-\n\finconsistencies, and conflicting testimony were not explained, or\n\neven mentioned, in the [state] trial court's [opinion]\"); Cooper v.\n\nPicard, 428 F.2d 1351, 1354 (1st Cir. 1970) (remanding for federal\n\nevidentiary hearing to develop facts anent claim of impermissibly\n\nsuggestive identification procedures). Here, however, the district\n\ncourt forsook a circumscribed inquiry and, to all intents and\n\npurposes, fashioned a new and expanded record relative to the\n\npetitioner's state court motion for a new trial.\n\n          Where, as here, a federal district court sitting in\n\nhabeas jurisdiction essentially replicates the entirety of the\n\nrelevant state court evidentiary record, it is on very shaky\n\nground.   See Thatsaphone v. Weber, 137 F.3d 1041, 1046 (8th Cir.\n\n1998) (suggesting that the district court \"went beyond its habeas\n\nauthority when it heard testimony rehashing what occurred at the\n\n[state court proceeding] and then reweighed the state court's fact\n\nfindings\").   Both Congress, in passing the AEDPA, and the Supreme\n\nCourt, in construing it, have made pellucid that a federal habeas\n\nproceeding should not be used as an occasion for a retrial of the\n\nstate court case.   See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-518, at 111 (1996)\n\n(explaining that the AEDPA was enacted to \"curb the abuse of the\n\nstatutory writ of habeas corpus\" and that it \"requires deference to\n\nthe determinations of state courts that are neither 'contrary to,'\n\nnor an 'unreasonable application of,' clearly established federal\n\nlaw\" (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1))); see also Williams, 529 U.S.\n\n\n                               -17-\n\fat 386 (opinion of Stevens, J.) (discussing Congress's intent \"to\n\nprevent 'retrials' on federal habeas\").\n\n           Although we think that this point is worth making and\n\nthat federal habeas courts should proceed with great circumspection\n\nin shaping the contours of evidentiary hearings, we need not decide\n\nin this case whether authorizing and conducting a full-scale\n\nevidentiary hearing constituted an abuse of discretion.        The\n\nfederal hearing was at the petitioner's instance and for her\n\nbenefit.   Yet (as we explain below), even taking this additional\n\nevidence and the district court's factual findings fully into\n\naccount, the petitioner's claims cannot succeed.     Any error in\n\nholding a full-scale evidentiary hearing was, therefore, harmless.\n\nSee, e.g., Gonzales v. Quarterman, 458 F.3d 384, 394 (5th Cir.\n\n2006); Greiner v. Wells, 417 F.3d 305, 318 n.15 (2d Cir. 2005).\n\nAccordingly, we bypass the question of whether the district court\n\nabused its discretion and consider its factual findings.\n\nIV. THE COMPETENCE CLAIM\n\n           The petitioner's flagship claim is that the district\n\ncourt erred in determining that she was competent to stand trial in\n\nthe state court.     The Commonwealth attempts to head off any\n\nsubstantive consideration of this claim through the interposition\n\nof nonexhaustion and procedural default defenses.   Because we may\n\naffirm the district court's denial of habeas relief on any ground\n\nmade manifest by the record, see, e.g., United States v. Cabrera-\n\n\n                               -18-\n\fPolo, 376 F.3d 29, 31 (1st Cir. 2004); InterGen N.V. v. Grina, 344\n\nF.3d 134, 141 (1st Cir. 2003), we start with this initiative.\n\n             A.   Exhaustion and Procedural Default.\n\n            Principles of comity and federalism push in favor of\n\ngiving state courts, without premature federal interference, a\n\nmeaningful opportunity to consider, and if necessary to correct,\n\nclaims of legal error in state criminal prosecutions.            See Vasquez\n\nv. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254, 257 (1986). Consequently, federal courts\n\nare, in most instances, barred from granting habeas relief on a\n\nparticular claim unless the petitioner has exhausted the remedies\n\navailable to her in state court with respect to that claim.            See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A); see also Jackson v. Coalter, 337 F.3d 74,\n\n85-86 (1st Cir. 2003).        But exhaustion is a prudential principle\n\nrather than a jurisdictional limitation, so a state may waive the\n\ndefense of nonexhaustion.         See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(3); see also\n\nGranberry   v.    Greer,   481   U.S.   129,   131   (1987);   Strickland   v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 684 (1984).\n\n            The   district    court     expressed    grave   doubt   that   the\n\npetitioner's competence claim had been exhausted in the state\n\ncourts.   It determined, however, that the Commonwealth had waived\n\nthis defense.     The court based that determination on the sequence\n\nof events described below.\n\n            Shortly   after      the    petitioner    docketed   her   habeas\n\npetition, the Commonwealth moved to dismiss the competence claim\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\f(among others) as unexhausted.        The petitioner opposed the motion.\n\nIn support of her opposition, she tendered various briefs that she\n\nhad   filed    with   the   SJC.     After      mulling     her    response,   the\n\nCommonwealth     moved   to    withdraw   its      motion   to    dismiss.      The\n\nwithdrawal motion stated in pertinent part: \"Having reviewed the[]\n\nmaterials, undersigned counsel believes that the petitioner is\n\ncorrect in her assertion that [the] claims presented in Grounds one\n\nthrough   three    of    her   petition     have     been   exhausted.\"        This\n\nconcession encompassed the competence claim (ground one in the\n\nhabeas petition).\n\n              It is hornbook law that waivers of exhaustion will not\n\nlightly be inferred but, rather, must be clear and explicit.                   See\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(3) (mandating that state must \"expressly\" waive\n\nexhaustion); Mercadel v. Cain, 179 F.3d 271, 276 (5th Cir. 1999)\n\n(finding implicit waiver of exhaustion \"not determinative\" because\n\nwaiver must be express).        The waiver here satisfies that rigorous\n\nstandard; it was unmistakably clear.\n\n              Notwithstanding the clarity of the language that it\n\nemployed, the Commonwealth now suggests that it did not really\n\nwaive   its    nonexhaustion     defense.       It    tries   to    justify    this\n\ntergiversation by pointing out that the petitioner refined her\n\ncompetence claim at a later date (when she served a memorandum of\n\nlaw in support of her habeas petition).               Had it been apprised of\n\nthe exact dimensions of the competence claim that was embedded in\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fground one of the petition, the Commonwealth protests, it never\n\nwould have agreed that the claim was exhausted.\n\n           The district court rejected this suggestion.            It ruled\n\nthat the Commonwealth, which was on notice from the commencement of\n\nthe habeas proceedings that the petitioner was raising a competence\n\nclaim, had knowingly and voluntarily abandoned the exhaustion\n\ndefense.   We agree with this assessment.\n\n           The habeas petition states, as its first ground for\n\nrelief, that the petitioner's conviction was \"obtained at trial\n\nwhere petitioner was unable to meaningfully consult and communicate\n\neffectively   with   counsel.\"     This   language    echoes   a   familiar\n\nformulation of the test for competence to stand trial.         See Cooper\n\nv. Oklahoma, 517 U.S. 348, 368 (1996) (emphasizing that a critical\n\ncomponent of competence is the ability to \"communicate effectively\n\nwith defense counsel\"); Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 402\n\n(1960) (per curiam) (defining competence in part as the \"present\n\nability to consult with [a] lawyer with a reasonable degree of\n\nrational understanding\").        It put the Commonwealth squarely on\n\nnotice that the petitioner was asserting a competence claim — and\n\nthe Commonwealth proceeded unreservedly to waive nonexhaustion as\n\na defense to that claim.\n\n           That was game, set, and match.            Waiver typically is\n\nthought to be the voluntary relinquishment of a known right.            See\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733 (1993).        It is no secret\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fthat waivers are strong medicine, not casually to be dispensed.             A\n\nparty who chooses to waive a defense surrenders that defense as to\n\nthe claim asserted and any claim fairly encompassed within it. Cf.\n\nNew York v. AMRO Realty Corp., 936 F.2d 1520, 1430 & n.10 (2d Cir.\n\n1991) (holding that in waiving a late-notice defense, insurer\n\nwaived that defense as to any claim arising out of the occurrence\n\nin question).     In other words, the waiver extends to the claim\n\nstated and any variants of the claim that are readily ascertainable\n\nfrom the language of the petition or complaint.         The waiving party\n\ncannot   play   the   ostrich,   burying   its   head   in   the   sand   and\n\nstruthiously ignoring that which ought to be obvious.\n\n           The competence claim pursued by the petitioner was well\n\nwithin the compass of the language contained in ground one of the\n\nhabeas petition. The fact that the Commonwealth came to regret its\n\nwaiver is not a sufficient reason to allow rescission of the\n\nwaiver. See, e.g., Dorsey v. Chapman, 262 F.3d 1181, 1187 (11th\n\nCir. 2001) (declining to allow the state to resurrect exhaustion\n\ndefense when it had expressly declined to raise the defense in the\n\ndistrict court, even though the state claimed that its earlier\n\ndeclination was based on a mistaken belief); Bledsue v. Johnson,\n\n188 F.3d 250, 254 (5th Cir. 1999) (finding that state had waived\n\nnonexhaustion defense by admitting in its original answer that the\n\npetitioner had exhausted state remedies).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\f             Nor is the fact that the labeling of the claim changed\n\nover time sufficient to warrant rescission of the waiver; to the\n\nextent that the claim was vague or not specifically identified in\n\nhaec verba as a competence claim, it was incumbent upon the waiving\n\nparty to use caution in the exercise of the waiver.             Cf. In re\n\nCargill, Inc., 66 F.3d 1256, 1261 (1st Cir. 1995) (declining to\n\nallow retraction of waiver and noting that \"litigants ordinarily\n\nare bound by their attorneys' tactical judgments\").       Regardless of\n\nthe absence of a label, the allegations pointed unerringly to the\n\nissue of competency.       We conclude, therefore, that because the\n\nCommonwealth was on clear notice of the petitioner's assertion of\n\nthe competence claim, its express and unqualified waiver of the\n\nnonexhaustion defense was effective as to the later iteration of\n\nthat claim.\n\n             The   Commonwealth's   defense   of   procedural    default,\n\ninitially raised in this court, is too little and too late.             A\n\nhabeas claim is procedurally defaulted in either of two situations.\n\nFirst, a claim is procedurally defaulted if the state court has\n\ndenied relief on that claim on independent and adequate state\n\nprocedural grounds.     See Lambrix v. Singletary, 520 U.S. 518, 522-\n\n23 (1997).    Second, a claim is procedurally defaulted if it was not\n\npresented to the state courts and it is clear that those courts\n\nwould have held the claim procedurally barred.          See Coleman v.\n\nThompson, 501 U.S. 722, 735 n.1 (1991); Perruquet v. Briley, 390\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fF.3d 505, 514 (7th Cir. 2004).            The habeas respondent (here, the\n\nCommonwealth) bears the burden \"not only of asserting that a\n\ndefault occurred, but also of persuading the court that the factual\n\nand legal prerequisites of a default . . . are present.\"               2 Hertz\n\n& Liebman, supra § 26.2a, at 1265 n.5.\n\n          We   assume   that,   as    a    matter   of   discretion,   we   may\n\nconsider the Commonwealth's belated assertion of the defense of\n\nprocedural default. See Brewer v. Marshall, 119 F.3d 993, 999 (1st\n\nCir. 1997) (noting that a federal court has discretionary authority\n\nto consider a belatedly raised procedural default defense or even\n\nto raise procedural default sua sponte).            Because no state court\n\nhas ruled on the petitioner's competence claim, the Commonwealth's\n\nposition necessarily hinges on the second branch of the procedural\n\ndefault defense.   It cannot satisfy that standard.\n\n          In this case, exhaustion and procedural default are not\n\ncompletely separate matters.     This imbrication is quite important;\n\nin expressly waiving the nonexhaustion defense, the Commonwealth\n\nlost the concomitant right, in the procedural default context, to\n\nassert that the claim was not presented to the state courts.                See\n\nBledsue, 188 F.3d at 254 (concluding that the state had waived this\n\nform of procedural default defense when it admitted that the habeas\n\npetitioner had exhausted his state remedies).\n\n          Beyond the waiver, the Commonwealth has not shown that\n\nthe competence claim, if presented today in the state courts, would\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\fbe    procedurally    barred.       It    off-handedly   references    a   state\n\nprocedural rule in support of its procedural default defense — but\n\nthat rule cannot carry the weight that the Commonwealth places on\n\nit.     The rule provides in part that grounds not raised in an\n\noriginal motion for a new trial are waived \"unless the judge in the\n\nexercise of discretion permits them to be raised in a subsequent\n\nmotion.\"    Mass. R. Crim. P. 30(c)(2).         Along this line, the SJC has\n\nindicated that, in \"extraordinary cases,\" a motions justice may\n\ninvoke Rule 30(c)(2) to consider new issues even after an appeal\n\nhas been decided.      Commonwealth v. Harrington, 399 N.E.2d 475, 478\n\n(Mass. 1980).\n\n            The second branch of the procedural default defense\n\ndepends on a high degree of confidence that the state court, if\n\nasked to adjudicate the claim, would declare it to be procedurally\n\ndefaulted.       See Cassett v. Stewart, 406 F.3d 614, 622-23 (9th Cir.\n\n2005).     This is as it should be: a federal court always must be\n\nchary    about    reaching   a    conclusion,    based   upon   a   speculative\n\nanalysis of what a state court might do, that a particular claim is\n\nprocedurally foreclosed.          See, e.g., Banks v. Horn, 126 F.3d 206,\n\n212-13 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n            We    apply   those    principles    here.     Given    the    divers\n\npossibilities that attend this situation, we are uncertain what\n\nprocedural course the state trial court would take if asked to rule\n\n\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\fon the competence claim.       That uncertainty dooms the procedural\n\ndefault defense.   Id. at 213.\n\n          Of   course,   our   double-barreled   conclusion   that   the\n\nCommonwealth waived its nonexhaustion defense and that it cannot\n\nmount a successful procedural default defense does not compel us to\n\nadjudicate the competence claim on the merits. A federal court may\n\nchoose, in its sound discretion, to reject a state's waiver of\n\neither nonexhaustion or procedural default.        See Granberry, 481\n\nU.S. at 134-35; Earhart v. Johnson, 132 F.3d 1062, 1065 (5th Cir.\n\n1998); cf. Oakes v. United States, 400 F.3d 92, 97 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(holding, in a federal prisoner's habeas case under 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2255, that the district court may raise the question of procedural\n\ndefault even if that defense was waived by the government).           In\n\nexercising this discretion, concerns of comity, federalism, and\n\njudicial economy weigh heavily in the balance.     See Granberry, 481\n\nU.S. at 134-35 (directing courts of appeals to determine, on a\n\ncase-by-case basis, whether valid interests would be served by\n\nreturning the case to state court).\n\n          Here, we see no reason to turn a blind eye to the\n\nCommonwealth's waiver.    Whatever the extent of the state court's\n\nopportunity to adjudicate the competence claim — a matter as to\n\nwhich the parties vehemently disagree — that court did evaluate the\n\nfactual basis upon which the competence claim is premised.           With\n\nthat in mind, it is difficult to imagine how the interests of\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\fcomity will be disserved by permitting a federal court, taking\n\ncognizance of those factual findings, to resolve the competence\n\nclaim on its merits.\n\n             To cinch matters, the interests of judicial economy also\n\nwill be served by putting the competence claim to rest here and\n\nnow. The district court has held an extensive evidentiary hearing,\n\nand there is no way to unring the bell.\n\n             To say more on this issue would be to paint the lily.7\n\nFor the reasons elucidated above, we hold the Commonwealth to its\n\nexpress     waiver   of   exhaustion,    reject   its   belated    attempt   to\n\ninterpose a defense of procedural default, and proceed to evaluate\n\nthe merits of the petitioner's competence claim.\n\n                               B.   The Merits.\n\n             It is common ground that the Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment prohibits states from prosecuting those who\n\nare   not    competent    to   stand    trial.      See,   e.g.,   Medina    v.\n\nCalifornia, 505 U.S. 437, 439 (1992).            The test for competence is\n\nuncontroversial; the accused, before and during the trial, must\n\nhave \"sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a\n\nreasonable degree of rational understanding\" and must possess \"a\n\n\n      7\n      It is worth noting that, in the end, we find the competence\nclaim wanting. See infra Part IV(B). When a federal court grants\nhabeas relief on an unexhausted claim, comity concerns are greater\nthan when it denies relief on such a claim. See Jones v. Jones,\n163 F.3d 285, 299 (5th Cir. 1998); see also 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(2)\n(authorizing a federal court to deny unexhausted habeas claims on\nthe merits).\n\n                                       -27-\n\frational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings\n\nagainst him.\"         Dusky, 362 U.S. at 402; see United States v.\n\nPellerito, 878 F.2d 1535, 1544 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n             The petitioner in this case makes a different kind of\n\ncompetency claim.         She does not impugn her capacity to have\n\nunderstood the nature and import of the proceedings against her and\n\nto have communicated with her counsel on most subjects. She claims\n\ninstead that the competence standard was infringed by her inability\n\nto communicate the facts touching upon her abuse to her lawyers.\n\nThe state court motions justice questioned her overall credibility.\n\nThe district court took a more empathetic view, finding that severe\n\nand pervasive abuse had occurred. But that court, too, rejected the\n\npetitioner's claim, concluding that she had retained the ability to\n\ncommunicate the abuse to her lawyers in the months leading up to\n\nthe trial.\n\n             Taking the full sweep of the evidentiary record into\n\naccount, see supra Part III, we focus on the district court's\n\nfactual findings (rather than those of the state court).               That\n\nfocus, combined with the absence of a state court decision on the\n\ncompetence claim, alters the normal AEDPA standard of review and\n\nmakes this case procedurally more like a direct criminal appeal.\n\nThus,   we   will     uphold   the   district   court's   determination   of\n\ncompetence     made    after    an   evidentiary    hearing   unless   that\n\ndetermination is clearly erroneous.          See United States v. Santos,\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\f131    F.3d   16,     20   (1st   Cir.   1997).    That     standard   is    quite\n\ndeferential; a finding of fact is clearly erroneous only when, upon\n\na thorough assessment of the record, the reviewing court is left\n\nwith an abiding conviction that a mistake has been made.                    United\n\nStates v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948); Ferrara v.\n\nUnited States, 456 F.3d 278, 287 (1st Cir. 2006).                      Given the\n\nindependent factfinding that took place here and the intensely\n\nfact-based nature of competency inquiries, see Drope v. Missouri,\n\n420 U.S. 162, 180 (1975), we see no reason to deviate from this\n\ndeferential standard of review.            See supra Part II.\n\n              Of course, an assertion of legal error still engenders de\n\nnovo review.        See United States v. Wiggin, 429 F.3d 31, 37 (1st\n\nCir.   2005).       Here,    however,    neither   party    suggests   that   the\n\ndistrict court applied an incorrect legal standard in adjudicating\n\nthe issue of competence.           Consequently, we train the lens of our\n\ninquiry on two matters: the district court's factual findings and\n\nthe question of whether those findings supported its ultimate\n\nconclusion.\n\n              At the end of the federal evidentiary hearing, the\n\ndistrict      court    credited    large    portions   of    the   petitioner's\n\ntestimony and found that she had been subject to severe and\n\npervasive abuse prior to her pretrial incarceration.                   The court\n\nalso found that some emotional abuse had continued during her\n\nimmurement.     Notwithstanding these (favorable) findings, the court\n\n\n                                         -29-\n\fconcluded     that    the   petitioner       had    been   able,     throughout    the\n\npretrial period and the trial itself, to communicate the abuse to\n\nher lawyers, but had made an affirmative decision not to broach\n\nthat topic.     In the court's view, the petitioner, \"at the relevant\n\ntimes,\" was not \"incapable of choice.\"               Indeed, the petitioner had\n\na   \"sufficient      and    then    present    ability     to    consult    with   her\n\nattorneys\" with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.\n\nTherefore, she was competent to stand trial.\n\n              The    district      court's    ultimate     conclusion       is   amply\n\nsupported by the record.              The court picked its way carefully\n\nthrough a tangled evidentiary thicket.               It took issue with some of\n\nthe state court's findings, credited much of the petitioner's\n\ntestimony, and gave credence to her expert's opinion that she had\n\nexperienced battered woman's syndrome.                At the same time, however,\n\nthe   court    discounted       significant        portions     of   her   testimony,\n\nincluding her claims of abuse suffered as a child, her claim that\n\nshe had attempted to raise the issue of abuse with her attorneys at\n\none point during the state court proceedings, and her various\n\nversions of the events that transpired on the day of the murder.\n\nIn the end, the court found that the petitioner had not proved that\n\nan inability to communicate existed at the critical time.\n\n              The court was fully entitled to accept parts of the\n\ntestimony of the petitioner and her experts yet reject the ultimate\n\nconclusion that they advocated.                See Wiggin, 429 F.3d at 37;\n\n\n                                        -30-\n\fSantos, 131 F.3d at 20-21; see also United States v. Alicea, 205\n\nF.3d 480, 483 (1st Cir. 2000) (explaining that a factfinder \"has\n\nthe prerogative to credit some parts of a witness's testimony and\n\ndisregard other potentially contradictory portions\").       Certain\n\nfeatures of this case reinforce that entitlement.\n\n          For one thing, the story that the petitioner told at\n\ntrial in the state court did not jibe with Loring's account but,\n\nrather, incriminated him.   It seems logical to infer that, had the\n\npetitioner been completely under Loring's spell at that time, her\n\ntestimony would have been more in tune with his.       Cf. State v.\n\nKelly, 478 A.2d 364, 372 (N.J. 1984) (noting that victims of\n\nbattered woman's syndrome have a tendency to accept responsibility\n\nfor the batterer's actions).\n\n          For another thing, the logistics of the relationship\n\nbetween Loring and the petitioner were dramatically altered from\n\nand after their arrests.    Both he and she were incarcerated for\n\nnearly a year prior to trial.   They were housed on separate floors,\n\nand neither of them was free to move at will about the jail.    The\n\npetitioner constructed an elaborate theory of how Loring was able\n\nto exert continued dominion over her during this interval and the\n\ndistrict court seems to have bought into that theory.      Even so,\n\nLoring's control over Pike plainly was palliated by their lack of\n\nphysical proximity.   See McMaugh v. State, 612 A.2d 725, 728, 730\n\n(R.I. 1992) (deeming continuous contact relevant to the conclusion\n\n\n                                -31-\n\fthat    battered     woman's       syndrome    rendered        defendant    unable    to\n\ncommunicate her abuse).             The district court's ultimate conclusion\n\n— that the petitioner, during this period, retained the ability to\n\nmake a real choice about whether to disclose the details of their\n\nrelationship to her counsel — seems to us a tacit recognition that\n\nLoring's control had abated.\n\n            Then, too, other straws in the wind pointed to the\n\npetitioner's competency to stand trial.                  For example, the district\n\ncourt heard testimony from one of the petitioner's trial attorneys.\n\nThis seasoned criminal defense lawyer harbored no doubt about the\n\npetitioner's competence at the time of trial. He reported that the\n\npetitioner     responded          alertly   and     appropriately    to    questions,\n\ntestified articulately, and took an active part in her own defense.\n\nThis testimony was borne out by the transcript of the state court\n\ntrial    and   by         other    evidence        of   the    petitioner's    active\n\nparticipation        in     her    defense,        including    evidence    that     the\n\npetitioner     had    written        letters       to   her   attorneys    during    her\n\nincarceration.\n\n            The court also heard the testimony of Loring's defense\n\ncounsel, who described the petitioner, in the relevant time frame,\n\nas \"calm\" and \"collected.\"             In addition, the Commonwealth adduced\n\nevidence that, as compared to Loring, the petitioner seemed \"the\n\nstronger of the two individuals in th[e] situation that they were\n\nboth in.\"\n\n\n                                            -32-\n\f            Although the petitioner offered explanations to counter\n\nmany of these items, the district court was in no way bound either\n\nto accept those explanations or to ignore the Commonwealth's\n\nevidence.     In    the    final     analysis,   it   was    wholly    within    the\n\nfactfinder's province to resolve these contradictions and to choose\n\namong the conflicting inferences that the evidence suggested.                    See\n\nUnited States v. Gobbi, 471 F.3d 302, 311 (1st Cir. 2006); United\n\nStates v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 713 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n            In an attempt to salvage the competence claim, the\n\npetitioner cites several cases in which battered woman's syndrome\n\nhas been the basis for questioning a defendant's competence.                    See,\n\ne.g., Commonwealth v. Conaghan, 740 N.E.2d 956, 960 (Mass. 2000);\n\nMcMaugh, 612 A.2d at 732.            This is something of a red herring;\n\nthese cases stand for nothing more than the now-unremarkable\n\nproposition     that      battered    woman's     syndrome     can    in   certain\n\ncircumstances      render    a   criminal      defendant    incompetent.        The\n\ndistrict court recognized this proposition (as do we) but found it\n\ninapplicable in this situation.                As we have said, that fact-\n\nspecific determination was not clearly erroneous.\n\n            That resolves this aspect of the matter.                 After hearing\n\nextensive testimony — perhaps more than it should have heard, see\n\nsupra Part III — and carefully reviewing an amplitudinous record,\n\nthe district court made a factual finding that the petitioner, at\n\nand before her trial, had the ability to consult and communicate\n\n\n                                        -33-\n\fwith her counsel and to assist in her defense.             That finding may be\n\narguable, but we have no abiding conviction that it was wrong.             The\n\nfinding is, therefore, entitled to deference.                See Ferrara, 456\n\nF.3d at 287; Wiggin, 429 F.3d at 37.           It follows that the district\n\ncourt did not err in rejecting the competence claim.\n\nV.   THE INVOLUNTARY WAIVER CLAIM\n\n           We next address the petitioner's claim that the effects\n\nof the abuse, when combined with Loring's continued coercive\n\ncontrol over her, forced her to forgo asserting battered woman's\n\nsyndrome as a defense and, thus, violated her constitutional\n\nrights.   The petitioner constructs this portion of her argument in\n\ntwo layers.\n\n           The foundation is a line of Supreme Court cases that\n\nspeak to an accused's constitutional right to present a defense.\n\nSee, e.g., Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44, 51 (1987); Crane v.\n\nKentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 690 (1986); Chambers v. Mississippi, 410\n\nU.S. 284, 302 (1973); Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 18-19\n\n(1967).    But    these    cases   are   not    directly     applicable;   the\n\npetitioner's     right    to   present   the    battered    woman's   syndrome\n\ndefense, if infringed at all, was infringed by Loring, not by the\n\nCommonwealth.\n\n           In an effort to overcome this obstacle, the petitioner\n\nadds the next forensic layer.       That layer builds on cases which, in\n\nher view, indicate that, even in the absence of state action, the\n\n\n                                    -34-\n\fright to present a defense may be abridged either by the conduct of\n\na private party, see, e.g., Nichols v. Butler, 953 F.2d 1550, 1552\n\n(11th Cir. 1992) (en banc); United States v. Teague, 953 F.2d 1525,\n\n1532 (11th Cir. 1992) (en banc); United States v. Butts, 630 F.\n\nSupp. 1145, 1147-49 (D. Me. 1986), or by an accused's own physical\n\nor mental condition, see, e.g., United States v. Ferrarini, 219\n\nF.3d 145, 151 (2d Cir. 2000).\n\n            The district court voiced understandable skepticism about\n\nwhether involuntary waiver of a particular defense could constitute\n\na separate habeas claim.          This may explain why the court did not\n\nspecifically rule on this claim in its ore sponte denial of the\n\nhabeas petition.     We need not belabor the point.        The availability\n\nof the claim as a ground for habeas relief is a question of law —\n\nand   one    that   the   state     courts   did   not   directly   address.\n\nAccordingly, our review is de novo.          See Fortini, 257 F.3d at 47.\n\n            At first blush, this \"involuntary waiver\" claim may seem\n\nlike nothing more than a recasting of the competence claim. But\n\ncompetence and voluntariness are separate (though complementary)\n\ninquiries.    \"The focus of a competency inquiry is the defendant's\n\nmental capacity\" whereas the focus of a voluntariness inquiry is on\n\n\"whether the defendant actually does understand the significance\n\nand consequences of a particular decision and whether the decision\n\nis uncoerced.\"      Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389, 401 n.12 (1993).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -35-\n\f            Although   the   right    to   present    a    defense   is   of\n\nconstitutional dimension,8 it is not absolute.            See, e.g., Nix v.\n\nWhiteside, 475 U.S. 157, 173 (1986) (recognizing that the right\n\ndoes not extend to committing perjury).          Accordingly, the Supreme\n\nCourt has tended to recognize the right in carefully defined\n\ncontexts.    See, e.g., Crane, 476 U.S. at 690 (finding a violation\n\nof the right when the state precluded the defendant's use of\n\n\"competent, reliable evidence . . . central to the defendant's\n\nclaim of innocence\"); Washington, 388 U.S. at 18-19 (indicating\n\nthat a denial of the right to compulsory process would be a denial\n\nof the right to present a defense).\n\n            None of this gets the petitioner very far.          Unless the\n\naccused's right to present a defense is infringed by state action,\n\nthe infringement is not redressable by a federal court charged\n\nwith vindicating federal constitutional rights.               As a general\n\nproposition,    the    Fourteenth    Amendment     protects    individuals\n\nexclusively against government action, leaving the conduct of\n\nprivate parties to regulation by statutory and common law.            See,\n\ne.g., Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830, 837 (1982); Logiodice\n\nv. Trs. of Me. Cent. Inst., 296 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n\n\n     8\n      The petitioner seems uncertain whether the right that she\nasserts is rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment or in the Sixth Amendment as applied to the\nstates through the Fourteenth Amendment. See Petitioner's Br. at\n49. Because we find no violation of any cognizable constitutional\nright, we need not untangle this knot.\n\n                                    -36-\n\f           This is an unsurmountable barrier to the petitioner's\n\ninvoluntary waiver claim.     In mounting that claim, she does not\n\nassign the Commonwealth any responsibility for thwarting her right\n\nto present a defense.9     She alleges only that Loring, a private\n\nparty, interfered with her exercise of that right through his\n\nabusive and coercive behavior.        That infringement, even if it\n\ntranspired, does not pave the way for federal habeas relief.\n\n           The   several   \"private    party\"   cases   cited   by   the\n\npetitioner do not suggest a way around this barrier.            Each of\n\nthose cases involved coercion by the accused's attorney and turned\n\non a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel.        See Nichols,\n\n953 F.2d at 1552; Teague, 953 F.2d at 1534; Butts, 630 F. Supp. at\n\n1147-49.   That is a recognized violation of the Sixth Amendment\n\nright to counsel and, thus, an independent basis for federal\n\nhabeas relief.   See, e.g., Strickland, 466 U.S. at 686; Ouber v.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n      Although the petitioner cites an occasional case indicating\nthat trial courts have an affirmative duty to prevent the\ninvoluntary waiver of certain rights, see, e.g., Johnson v. Zerbst,\n304 U.S. 458, 464-65 (1938) (discussing waivers of right to\ncounsel), she has not argued that the state trial court should have\nconducted some particularized inquiry in her case; nor does she\nidentify what would have put the court on notice of the need to\nconduct such an inquiry. Where, as here, an appellant has merely\nhinted obliquely at an argument but has not advanced it distinctly,\nthat argument is not in the case. See United States v. Zannino,\n895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"It is not enough merely to mention\na possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to\ndo counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put\nflesh on its bones.\").\n\n                                -37-\n\fGuarino, 293 F.3d 19, 35-36 (1st Cir. 2002).              The petitioner in\n\nthis case makes no comparable claim.\n\n           The petitioner's contention that a physical or mental\n\ncondition, not attributable to state action, may work a violation\n\nof an accused's constitutional right to present a defense is\n\nwishful thinking.     The single case that she cites in support of\n\nthat   proposition   is   far   off    the   point.   In    that      case,   the\n\ndefendant argued that the denial of his motion for either a\n\nseverance or a continuance following a heart attack deprived him\n\nof his constitutional right to testify.           See Ferrarini, 219 F.3d\n\nat 151.   As such, the constitutional claim was focused not on the\n\ndefendant's   physical    condition      but,   rather,    on   the    district\n\ncourt's decision to forge ahead with the trial despite knowledge\n\nof the defendant's infirmity — a decision that plainly constituted\n\nstate action. See Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 14 (1948)\n\n(deeming \"long [] established\" the proposition that the actions of\n\nstate courts and judicial officers in their official capacities\n\nconstitute state action).\n\n           The short of the matter is that the petitioner invites\n\nus to find a constitutional violation (separate and distinct from\n\nineffective assistance of counsel) in the infringement of an\n\naccused's right to present a defense by a private party alone,\n\nwithout any awareness (actual or imputed) of that infringement by\n\n\n\n\n                                      -38-\n\fa state actor.      We decline her invitation.10        We emphasize that, in\n\ndoing so, we do not hold that an infringement of this right by a\n\nprivate party may never result in a constitutional violation; this\n\ncase does not require us to sweep so broadly.             We do hold that the\n\npetitioner's involuntary waiver claim, as formulated here, is not\n\ncognizable as a separate and distinct ground for federal habeas\n\nrelief.\n\nVI.   CONCLUSION\n\n              We   summarize   succinctly.      Because    the   Commonwealth\n\nwaived its defense of nonexhaustion and failed to establish a\n\ndefense of procedural default, we have considered the merits of\n\nthe petitioner's claim that she was incompetent to stand trial in\n\nthe   state    court.     We   find   the    district    court's   fact-bound\n\nrejection of that claim to be supportable.\n\n              The petitioner's remaining initiative — her claim of\n\ninvoluntary waiver — lacks legal footing and, thus, does not open\n\na separate avenue for federal habeas relief.                  We need go no\n\nfurther.\n\n\n\n\n      10\n      It bears mentioning that, even if we were to recognize this\nnew type of constitutional violation, we would likely be barred\nfrom granting habeas relief on this claim under the familiar\ndoctrine of Teague v.

For two reasons — because Pike has made a colorable\nclaim that the Commonwealth waived the Teague issue below and\nbecause the merits of this claim are relatively clear-cut — we have\nelected to bypass an in-depth Teague analysis.

In the principal appeal, the petitioner  who portrays herself as a victim of battered woman's syndrome  urges us to reverse the denial of habeas relief and hold that she lacked competency to stand trial in the state court or, alternatively, that she involuntarily waived her right to present a viable theory of defense. In the cross-appeal, the respondent (the superintendent of the state correctional facility in which the petitioner is confined) urges us to revisit the district court's determinations concerning exhaustion of state remedies and the granting of a federal evidentiary hearing, as well as to consider a nascent theory of procedural default. After working our way through a procedural <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> quagmire, examining a mountain of paper, and studying a complex set of legal issues, we reject both appeals and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p>This case has a lengthy and tortured history. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (the SJC) has accurately recounted the evidence presented at the petitioner's trial and in the subsequent state court proceedings. <i>See </i><i>Commonwealth v. Pike,</i> 431 Mass. 212, 726 N.E.2d 940, 942-51 (2000) (<i>Pike I</i>). We assume the reader's familiarity with that opinion, rehearse here only those details that are directly relevant to our analysis, and amplify that account to reflect evidence presented before the federal habeas court.</p>\n<p>In 1995, a Massachusetts jury found the petitioner, Julie A. Pike, guilty of second-degree murder. This conviction resulted from the interaction of the petitioner and her swain, Barry Loring, with Don Maynard. As part and parcel of what began as a plan to steal a car, Maynard was slain in his Greenfield home. The murder occurred in 1994 and suspicion soon centered on Loring and the petitioner.</p>\n<p>Loring agreed to plead guilty and became the Commonwealth's star witness at his former girlfriend's trial. He vouchsafed that the pair had broken into Maynard's abode together; that they then agreed that Loring would kill Maynard using a gun discovered inside the house; but that, when Maynard returned home earlier than anticipated, an altercation between the two men ensued. According to Loring, the petitioner ended the scuffle by killing Maynard with a shot to the back of the head.</p>\n<p>In addition to Loring's eyewitness testimony, the Commonwealth presented substantial physical evidence linking the petitioner to Maynard's home; evidence that she had fled with Loring; proof that she had sold some of Maynard's property at a pawn shop; and testimony from Loring's cellmate that tended to corroborate Loring's account of the relevant events.</p>\n<p>The petitioner testified in her own defense. She admitted to her entanglement in the overall events, but maintained that she had not been present in the Maynard residence at the time of the homicide. Instead  following Loring's instructions  she had waited at a nearby bridge. Thus, the petitioner argued that her participation was limited to helping Loring clean up after the murder and dispose of Maynard's lifeless body.</p>\n<p>At the close of all the evidence, the jury rejected the petitioner's version and found her guilty of second-degree murder. The trial justice sentenced her to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p>During the pendency of the petitioner's direct appeal, she moved for a new trial. <i>See</i> Mass. R.Crim. P. 30(b). The gravamen of her motion was that the severely abusive nature of her relationship with Loring had allowed him to control her both at the time of the murder and thereafter (up to and including the time of trial). She explained that Loring was able to exert dominion over her after their arrest because the two were detained at the same jail (albeit on different floors), which permitted extraordinary levels of contact between them. In addition, the petitioner had been seven months pregnant at the time of the murder, Loring was the father, and he had minimally supervised visits with their infant child during his pretrial incarceration. The petitioner claimed that Loring used these visits as leverage against her, threatening to harm the child if she did not do his bidding.</p>\n<p>With this predicate in place, the petitioner maintained that she was under the spell <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> of Loring's pervasive influence until after the trial. Through that circumstance, he had coerced her into giving a fabricated version of the events surrounding the Maynard homicide. She proceeded to recant portions of her trial testimony. The petitioner admitted that she had been in the house prior to Maynard's death but continued to assert that she had not committed the murder.</p>\n<p>Taking matters a step further, the petitioner maintained that the combination of Loring's continued coercion and the cumulative psychological effects of the abuse (amounting to what is commonly known as battered woman's syndrome) rendered her incapable of disclosing the abuse to her attorneys at the time of trial.<sup>[1]</sup> In her view, both the revelation of the abuse and her changed testimony qualified as newly discovered evidence. <i>See </i><i>Commonwealth v. Grace,</i> 397 Mass. 303, 491 N.E.2d 246, 248 (1986). Furthermore, on her assessment of the case, this newly discovered evidence would have affected the outcome of the trial because it would have allowed her to explain that whatever actions she took on the day of Maynard's demise were taken under duress (i.e., coerced by Loring).</p>\n<p>The original trial justice had retired, so a different judicial officer (whom, for ease in exposition, we shall refer to as the state court motions justice) held a four-day evidentiary hearing to supplement the affidavits and psychiatric reports submitted with the petitioner's motion. The hearing included testimony from the petitioner, the therapist who had begun to treat her, the lawyers who had represented her at trial, and Dr. Prudence Baxter (an expert on battered woman's syndrome). At the conclusion of the hearing, the state court motions justice denied the motion in a strongly-worded opinion. <i>Commonwealth v. Pike,</i> No. 94-091, slip op. at 2 (Mass.Super.Ct. Apr. 8, 1998) (unpublished). We offer a synopsis of the findings upon which that decision rested.</p>\n<p>While assuming that evidence of battered woman's syndrome could in some cases support the granting of a new trial, the state court motions justice found the petitioner's version of events \"implausible\" and her testimony \"unreliable,\" especially with respect to the degree of control that Loring exerted over her during their pretrial incarceration. <i>Id.</i> at 13. Specifically, the state court justice concluded that \"[w]hile it [was] likely that [the petitioner] was subjected to some of the described acts [of abuse], at least up to the point of her incarceration, it [did] not follow that [she] meekly surrendered to Loring's inescapable control at the time of her trial.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The petitioner filed motions seeking reconsideration and leave to expand the record. <i>See</i> Mass. R.Crim. P. 13(a)(5). In connection therewith, she proffered affidavits from correctional officers employed at the jail where she and Loring had been detained prior to trial. The state court motions justice summarily denied these motions.</p>\n<p>The SJC allowed the petitioner's application for direct appellate review. <i>See</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> Mass. R.Crim. P. 30(c)(8). It subsequently affirmed both the conviction and the denial of the petitioner's post-trial motions. <i>See </i><i>Pike I,</i> 726 N.E.2d at 942. With respect to the new trial motion, the SJC confirmed that, under Massachusetts law, evidence of battered women's syndrome could constitute newly discovered evidence warranting a new trial. <i>Id.</i> at 948. Here, however, the petitioner's quest for a new trial was properly thwarted because the state court motions justice had made a supportable credibility determination  she simply did not believe that the petitioner suffered from the ravages of the syndrome during the period leading up to the trial. <i>Id.</i> at 949, 951. To cinch matters, the SJC held that the motions justice was not unreasonable in refusing to consider the additional affidavits. <i>See id.</i> at 951.</p>\n<p>Having been rebuffed by the SJC, the petitioner repaired to the federal district court and filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254. Of her several asserted grounds for relief, only two are pertinent here: (i) that battered woman's syndrome had rendered her incompetent to stand trial in state court and (ii) that her inability to disclose Loring's abuse to her trial counsel constituted an involuntary waiver of her constitutional right to present a defense.</p>\n<p>After some procedural skirmishing (to which we shortly shall return), the district court, without any detailed explanation, ordered an evidentiary hearing.<sup>[2]</sup> The hearing extended over eight days. The petitioner presented much of the same evidence that she had presented at the state court hearing on her new trial motion: her own testimony as to Loring's abuse, other testimony and affidavits corroborating the abuse, testimony from one of her lawyers, Dr. Baxter's testimony, and testimony from various therapists. The respondent (who, for ease of exposition, we shall call \"the Commonwealth\") produced several rebuttal witnesses, including Loring's trial attorney and its own psychiatric expert.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court, ruling from the bench, denied the petition. These timely appeals followed. The district court has granted a certificate of appealability as to all issues. <i>See id.</i> § 2253(c).</p>\n<p>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p>In this case, appellate review is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214. The AEDPA permits federal courts to grant habeas relief after a final state adjudication of a federal constitutional claim only if that adjudication:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p>28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). This standard applies, however, only to a \"claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> If the federal claim was never addressed by the state court, federal review is de novo. <i>See </i><i>Fortini v. Murphy,</i> 257 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that a federal court \"can hardly defer to the state court on an issue that the state court did not address\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> In this instance, it is undisputed that the SJC did not address either of the petitioner's current claims on the merits. To the extent, then, that these claims were properly before the district court  more on this later  the district court correctly subjected them to de novo review. The court also correctly recognized that the AEDPA sets out a separate and exacting standard applicable to review of a state court's factual findings. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1); <i>Sanna v. Dipaolo,</i> 265 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>As a general matter, the same standards that courts of appeals use in direct review of criminal convictions apply to appellate review of the decisions of federal district courts in state prisoner habeas cases. <i>See</i> 2 Steven Alan Childress &amp; Martha S. Davis, Federal Standards of Review § 13.06, at 13-50 (3d ed.1999). These include de novo review of legal issues and of most mixed questions of fact and law. <i>See </i><i>Scarpa v. DuBois,</i> 38 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1994). We say \"most\" because appellate review of mixed questions depends, in the last analysis, on the extent to which a particular question is fact-dominated or law-dominated.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See id.</i>; <i>see also </i><i>In re Extradition of Howard,</i> 996 F.2d 1320, 1328 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>When the district court undertakes no independent factfinding in a habeas case, we are effectively in the same position as the district court vis-à-vis the state court record and have the ability to review that record from the same vantage point. Consequently, the district court's recension of that record will engender de novo review. <i>See </i><i>Breest v. Perrin,</i> 624 F.2d 1112, 1115 (1st Cir.1980); 2 Childress &amp; Davis, <i>supra</i> § 13.06, at 13-50. When, however, the district court has held an evidentiary hearing and made new or different findings of fact, those findings are entitled to significant deference. <i>See </i><i>Scarpa,</i> 38 F.3d at 9 n. 5; <i>see also </i><i>McNair v. Campbell,</i> 416 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2005); <i>McGregor v. Gibson,</i> 248 F.3d 946, 951 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>III. THE HABEAS RECORD</p>\n<p>As a prelude to our analysis of the petitioner's claims, we deem it prudent to say something about the factual record that underpins our review. Although a magistrate judge recommended the opposite course of action, the district court granted a full-scale evidentiary hearing. That hearing had no apparent limits. It lasted nearly twice as long as the pertinent state court evidentiary hearing held seven years earlier, covered the same factual ground, and involved much of the same evidence.</p>\n<p>Despite this similitude, the district court evaluated the evidence somewhat differently than had the state court motions justice. It took a more flattering view of the petitioner's credibility and made several factual findings that contradicted those of the state court motions justice. The district court justified these contrary findings on the ground that, in the course of the federal evidentiary hearing, its view of the underlying facts had been proven by clear and convincing evidence  a standard <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> dictated by the AEDPA. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The Commonwealth asseverates that the district court erred in granting a full-scale evidentiary hearing and beseeches us to disregard its factual findings. This is more than empty rhetoric: unless a state prisoner meets certain stringent requirements, the AEDPA prohibits a federal court from granting an evidentiary hearing when \"the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> § 2254(e)(2).</p>\n<p>Seizing upon this prohibition, the Commonwealth argues that the petitioner, in the state courts, failed to develop the factual record needed to underbrace her habeas claims. In this vein, the Commonwealth notes that, at the state court evidentiary hearing, the petitioner did not call the lawyers who represented her at trial<sup>[5]</sup> and elected to submit affidavits in lieu of much of the live testimony that she presented at the federal evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p>The petitioner rejoins on several fronts. First, she argues that she did not fail to develop the factual basis for her claims because the key <i>facts</i>  those pertaining to the abuse and her consequent inability to disclose that abuse to her trial counsel  were presented to the state court (albeit in lesser detail). Thus, a federal evidentiary hearing was not statutorily prohibited. Second, she emphasizes that, in interpreting section 2254(e)(2), the Supreme Court has equated the \"failure to develop\" language with \"a lack of diligence, or some greater fault, attributable to the prisoner or prisoner's counsel.\" <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 420, 432, 120 S.Ct. 1479, 146 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Such diligence embodies, \"at a minimum, seek[ing] an evidentiary hearing in state court in the manner prescribed by state law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 437, 120 S.Ct. 1479. Because she sought and received an evidentiary hearing in the state court, the petitioner maintains that she satisfied the diligence standard. Third, the petitioner asserts that the presentation of additional evidence in the federal court is unimpugnable because, under prevailing jurisprudence, she had the right to augment the record on habeas review. <i>See</i> 1 Randy Hertz &amp; James S. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure § 20.2b, at 906 n. 21 (5th ed.2005). And, finally, the petitioner argues that the district court was <i>required</i> to grant her request for an evidentiary hearing under <i>Townsend v. Sain,</i> 372 U.S. 293, 312-13, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963).</p>\n<p>As a matter of statutory law, we reject the Commonwealth's importunings. Here, the petitioner adduced extensive evidence in the state court. The exact manner in which she elected to make the point is less important than the fact that she did make the point; her proffer went directly to the merits of the claims that she later sought to pursue in the federal court proceedings. We conclude, therefore, that the district court was not statutorily prohibited from taking evidence on those claims. <i>See </i><i>Bryan v. Mullin,</i> 335 F.3d 1207, 1215 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> (10th Cir.2003) (holding federal evidentiary hearing not statutorily barred when petitioner had sought to develop factual basis for claim in state court); <i>Matheney v. Anderson,</i> 253 F.3d 1025, 1039 (7th Cir. 2001) (similar).</p>\n<p>The fact that a federal evidentiary hearing was not statutorily barred does not mean that one was <i>required.</i> The decision to hold the hearing and the scale and scope of it are subject to review for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Crooker v. United States,</i> 814 F.2d 75, 76 n. 1 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n<p>In this instance, we find the scale and scope of the hearing problematic. Federal habeas is a collateral proceeding; particularly after AEDPA, it is not intended to provide a forum in which to retry state cases. <i>See </i><i>Bell v. Cone,</i> 535 U.S. 685, 693, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002). Consequently, in state prisoner habeas cases in which the applicant was afforded a full and fair hearing in state court, federal evidentiary hearings ought to be the exception, not the rule. <i>See </i><i>Townsend,</i> 372 U.S. at 314, 83 S.Ct. 745; <i>see also</i> 1 Hertz &amp; Liebman, <i>supra</i> § 20.1, at 887 n. 3 (noting that evidentiary hearings are allowed in less than 2% of all habeas filings). Even when such a hearing is thought desirable, restraint should be the watchword.</p>\n<p>Here, the state court had conducted a full and fair evidentiary hearing. Moreover, the federal court's chosen course of action led to extensive duplication of effort. When a federal court opts to hold an evidentiary hearing in a state habeas case, the prototypical purpose should be to fill a gap in the record or to supplement the record on a specific point.<sup>[6]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>López v. Massachusetts,</i> 480 F.3d 591, 597 (1st Cir.2007) (approving grant of federal evidentiary hearing to supplement petitioner's <i>Brady</i> claim); <i>Guidry v. Dretke,</i> 397 F.3d 306, 324 (5th Cir.2005) (approving grant of federal evidentiary hearing when \"gaps, inconsistencies, and conflicting testimony were not explained, or even mentioned, in the [state] trial court's [opinion]\"); <i>Cooper v. Picard,</i> 428 F.2d 1351, 1354 (1st Cir.1970) (remanding for federal evidentiary hearing to develop facts anent claim of impermissibly suggestive identification procedures). Here, however, the district court forsook a circumscribed inquiry and, to all intents and purposes, fashioned a new and expanded record relative to the petitioner's state court motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p>Where, as here, a federal district court sitting in habeas jurisdiction essentially replicates the entirety of the relevant state court evidentiary record, it is on very shaky ground. <i>See </i><i>Thatsaphone v. Weber,</i> 137 F.3d 1041, 1046 (8th Cir.1998) (suggesting that the district court \"went beyond its habeas authority when it heard testimony rehashing what occurred at the [state court proceeding] and then reweighed the state court's fact findings\"). Both Congress, in passing the AEDPA, and the Supreme Court, in construing it, have made pellucid that a federal habeas proceeding should not be used as an occasion for a retrial of the state court case. <i>See</i> H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-518, at 111 (1996), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1996, p. 944 (explaining that the AEDPA was enacted to \"curb the abuse of the statutory writ of habeas corpus\" and that it \"requires deference to the determinations of state courts that are neither `contrary to,' nor an `unreasonable application of,' clearly established federal law\" (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1))); <i>see also</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 386, 120 S.Ct. 1495 (opinion of Stevens, J.) (discussing Congress's intent \"to prevent `retrials' on federal habeas\").</p>\n<p>Although we think that this point is worth making and that federal habeas courts should proceed with great circumspection in shaping the contours of evidentiary hearings, we need not decide in this case whether authorizing and conducting a full-scale evidentiary hearing constituted an abuse of discretion. The federal hearing was at the petitioner's instance and for her benefit. Yet (as we explain below), even taking this additional evidence and the district court's factual findings fully into account, the petitioner's claims cannot succeed. Any error in holding a full-scale evidentiary hearing was, therefore, harmless. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gonzales v. Quarterman,</i> 458 F.3d 384, 394 (5th Cir.2006); <i>Greiner v. Wells,</i> 417 F.3d 305, 318 n. 15 (2d Cir. 2005). Accordingly, we bypass the question of whether the district court abused its discretion and consider its factual findings.</p>\n<p>IV. THE COMPETENCE CLAIM</p>\n<p>The petitioner's flagship claim is that the district court erred in determining that she was competent to stand trial in the state court. The Commonwealth attempts to head off any substantive consideration of this claim through the interposition of nonexhaustion and procedural default defenses. Because we may affirm the district court's denial of habeas relief on any ground made manifest by the record, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Cabrera-Polo,</i> 376 F.3d 29, 31 (1st Cir.2004); <i>InterGen N.V. v. Grina,</i> 344 F.3d 134, 141 (1st Cir.2003), we start with this initiative.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Exhaustion and Procedural Default.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Principles of comity and federalism push in favor of giving state courts, without premature federal interference, a meaningful opportunity to consider, and if necessary to correct, claims of legal error in state criminal prosecutions. <i>See </i><i>Vasquez v. Hillery,</i> 474 U.S. 254, 257, 106 S.Ct. 617, 88 L.Ed.2d 598 (1986). Consequently, federal courts are, in most instances, barred from granting habeas relief on a particular claim unless the petitioner has exhausted the remedies available to her in state court with respect to that claim. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A); <i>see also </i><i>Jackson v. Coalter,</i> 337 F.3d 74, 85-86 (1st Cir.2003). But exhaustion is a prudential principle rather than a jurisdictional limitation, so a state may waive the defense of nonexhaustion. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(3); <i>see also </i><i>Granberry v. Greer,</i> 481 U.S. 129, 131, 107 S.Ct. 1671, 95 L.Ed.2d 119 (1987); <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 684, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p>The district court expressed grave doubt that the petitioner's competence claim had been exhausted in the state courts. It determined, however, that the Commonwealth had waived this defense. The court based that determination on the sequence of events described below.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the petitioner docketed her habeas petition, the Commonwealth moved to dismiss the competence claim (among others) as unexhausted. The petitioner opposed the motion. In support of her opposition, she tendered various briefs that she had filed with the SJC. After mulling her response, the Commonwealth moved to withdraw its motion to dismiss. The withdrawal motion stated in pertinent part: \"Having reviewed the[] materials, undersigned counsel believes that the petitioner is correct in her assertion that [the] claims presented in Grounds <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> one through three of her petition have been exhausted.\" This concession encompassed the competence claim (ground one in the habeas petition).</p>\n<p>It is hornbook law that waivers of exhaustion will not lightly be inferred but, rather, must be clear and explicit. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(3) (mandating that state must \"expressly\" waive exhaustion); <i>Mercadel v. Cain,</i> 179 F.3d 271, 276 (5th Cir. 1999) (finding implicit waiver of exhaustion \"not determinative\" because waiver must be express). The waiver here satisfies that rigorous standard; it was unmistakably clear.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the clarity of the language that it employed, the Commonwealth now suggests that it did not really waive its nonexhaustion defense. It tries to justify this tergiversation by pointing out that the petitioner refined her competence claim at a later date (when she served a memorandum of law in support of her habeas petition). Had it been apprised of the exact dimensions of the competence claim that was embedded in ground one of the petition, the Commonwealth protests, it never would have agreed that the claim was exhausted.</p>\n<p>The district court rejected this suggestion. It ruled that the Commonwealth, which was on notice from the commencement of the habeas proceedings that the petitioner was raising a competence claim, had knowingly and voluntarily abandoned the exhaustion defense. We agree with this assessment.</p>\n<p>The habeas petition states, as its first ground for relief, that the petitioner's conviction was \"obtained at trial where petitioner was unable to meaningfully consult and communicate effectively with counsel.\" This language echoes a familiar formulation of the test for competence to stand trial. <i>See </i><i>Cooper v. Oklahoma,</i> 517 U.S. 348, 368, 116 S.Ct. 1373, 134 L.Ed.2d 498 (1996) (emphasizing that a critical component of competence is the ability to \"communicate effectively with defense counsel\"); <i>Dusky v. United States,</i> 362 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960) (per curiam) (defining competence in part as the \"present ability to consult with [a] lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\"). It put the Commonwealth squarely on notice that the petitioner was asserting a competence claim  and the Commonwealth proceeded <i>unreservedly</i> to waive nonexhaustion as a defense to that claim.</p>\n<p>That was game, set, and match. Waiver typically is thought to be the voluntary relinquishment of a known right. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). It is no secret that waivers are strong medicine, not casually to be dispensed. A party who chooses to waive a defense surrenders that defense as to the claim asserted and any claim fairly encompassed within it. <i>Cf. </i><i>New York v. AMRO Realty Corp.,</i> 936 F.2d 1420, 1430 &amp; n. 10 (2d Cir.1991) (holding that in waiving a late-notice defense, insurer waived that defense as to any claim arising out of the occurrence in question). In other words, the waiver extends to the claim stated and any variants of the claim that are readily ascertainable from the language of the petition or complaint. The waiving party cannot play the ostrich, burying its head in the sand and struthiously ignoring that which ought to be obvious.</p>\n<p>The competence claim pursued by the petitioner was well within the compass of the language contained in ground one of the habeas petition. The fact that the Commonwealth came to regret its waiver is not a sufficient reason to allow rescission of the waiver. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Dorsey v. Chapman,</i> 262 F.3d 1181, 1187 (11th Cir.2001) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> (declining to allow the state to resurrect exhaustion defense when it had expressly declined to raise the defense in the district court, even though the state claimed that its earlier declination was based on a mistaken belief); <i>Bledsue v. Johnson,</i> 188 F.3d 250, 254 (5th Cir.1999) (finding that state had waived nonexhaustion defense by admitting in its original answer that the petitioner had exhausted state remedies).</p>\n<p>Nor is the fact that the labeling of the claim changed over time sufficient to warrant rescission of the waiver; to the extent that the claim was vague or not specifically identified in <i>haec verba</i> as a competence claim, it was incumbent upon the waiving party to use caution in the exercise of the waiver. <i>Cf. </i><i>In re Cargill, Inc.,</i> 66 F.3d 1256, 1261 (1st Cir.1995) (declining to allow retraction of waiver and noting that \"litigants ordinarily are bound by their attorneys' tactical judgments\"). Regardless of the absence of a label, the allegations pointed unerringly to the issue of competency. We conclude, therefore, that because the Commonwealth was on clear notice of the petitioner's assertion of the competence claim, its express and unqualified waiver of the nonexhaustion defense was effective as to the later iteration of that claim.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth's defense of procedural default, initially raised in this court, is too little and too late. A habeas claim is procedurally defaulted in either of two situations. First, a claim is procedurally defaulted if the state court has denied relief on that claim on independent and adequate state procedural grounds. <i>See </i><i>Lambrix v. Singletary,</i> 520 U.S. 518, 522-23, 117 S.Ct. 1517, 137 L.Ed.2d 771 (1997). Second, a claim is procedurally defaulted if it was not presented to the state courts and it is clear that those courts would have held the claim procedurally barred. <i>See </i><i>Coleman v. Thompson,</i> 501 U.S. 722, 735 n. 1, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991); <i>Perruquet v. Briley,</i> 390 F.3d 505, 514 (7th Cir. 2004). The habeas respondent (here, the Commonwealth) bears the burden \"not only of asserting that a default occurred, but also of persuading the court that the factual and legal prerequisites of a default . . . are present.\" 2 Hertz &amp; Liebman, <i>supra</i> § 26.2a, at 1265 n. 5.</p>\n<p>We assume that, as a matter of discretion, we may consider the Commonwealth's belated assertion of the defense of procedural default. <i>See </i><i>Brewer v. Marshall,</i> 119 F.3d 993, 999 (1st Cir.1997) (noting that a federal court has discretionary authority to consider a belatedly raised procedural default defense or even to raise procedural default sua sponte). Because no state court has ruled on the petitioner's competence claim, the Commonwealth's position necessarily hinges on the second branch of the procedural default defense. It cannot satisfy that standard.</p>\n<p>In this case, exhaustion and procedural default are not completely separate matters. This imbrication is quite important; in expressly waiving the nonexhaustion defense, the Commonwealth lost the concomitant right, in the procedural default context, to assert that the claim was not presented to the state courts. <i>See </i><i>Bledsue,</i> 188 F.3d at 254 (concluding that the state had waived this form of procedural default defense when it admitted that the habeas petitioner had exhausted his state remedies).</p>\n<p>Beyond the waiver, the Commonwealth has not shown that the competence claim, if presented today in the state courts, would be procedurally barred. It offhandedly references a state procedural rule in support of its procedural default defense  but that rule cannot carry the weight that the Commonwealth places on it. The rule provides in part that grounds <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> not raised in an original motion for a new trial are waived \"unless the judge in the exercise of discretion permits them to be raised in a subsequent motion.\" Mass. R.Crim. P. 30(c)(2). Along this line, the SJC has indicated that, in \"extraordinary cases,\" a motions justice may invoke Rule 30(c)(2) to consider new issues even after an appeal has been decided. <i>Commonwealth v. Harrington,</i> 379 Mass. 446, 399 N.E.2d 475, 478 (1980).</p>\n<p>The second branch of the procedural default defense depends on a high degree of confidence that the state court, if asked to adjudicate the claim, would declare it to be procedurally defaulted. <i>See </i><i>Cassett v. Stewart,</i> 406 F.3d 614, 622-23 (9th Cir. 2005). This is as it should be: a federal court always must be chary about reaching a conclusion, based upon a speculative analysis of what a state court might do, that a particular claim is procedurally foreclosed. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Banks v. Horn,</i> 126 F.3d 206, 212-13 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>We apply those principles here. Given the divers possibilities that attend this situation, we are uncertain what procedural course the state trial court would take if asked to rule on the competence claim. That uncertainty dooms the procedural default defense. <i>Id.</i> at 213.</p>\n<p>Of course, our double-barreled conclusion that the Commonwealth waived its nonexhaustion defense and that it cannot mount a successful procedural default defense does not compel us to adjudicate the competence claim on the merits. A federal court may choose, in its sound discretion, to reject a state's waiver of either nonexhaustion or procedural default. <i>See </i><i>Granberry,</i> 481 U.S. at 134-35, 107 S.Ct. 1671; <i>Earhart v. Johnson,</i> 132 F.3d 1062, 1065 (5th Cir.1998); <i>cf. </i><i>Oakes v. United States,</i> 400 F.3d 92, 97 (1st Cir. 2005) (holding, in a federal prisoner's habeas case under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, that the district court may raise the question of procedural default even if that defense was waived by the government). In exercising this discretion, concerns of comity, federalism, and judicial economy weigh heavily in the balance. <i>See </i><i>Granberry,</i> 481 U.S. at 134-35, 107 S.Ct. 1671 (directing courts of appeals to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether valid interests would be served by returning the case to state court).</p>\n<p>Here, we see no reason to turn a blind eye to the Commonwealth's waiver. Whatever the extent of the state court's opportunity to adjudicate the competence claim  a matter as to which the parties vehemently disagree  that court did evaluate the factual basis upon which the competence claim is premised. With that in mind, it is difficult to imagine how the interests of comity will be disserved by permitting a federal court, taking cognizance of those factual findings, to resolve the competence claim on its merits.</p>\n<p>To cinch matters, the interests of judicial economy also will be served by putting the competence claim to rest here and now. The district court has held an extensive evidentiary hearing, and there is no way to unring the bell.</p>\n<p>To say more on this issue would be to paint the lily.<sup>[7]</sup> For the reasons elucidated above, we hold the Commonwealth to its express waiver of exhaustion, reject its belated attempt to interpose a defense of procedural default, and proceed to evaluate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> the merits of the petitioner's competence claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Merits.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>It is common ground that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from prosecuting those who are not competent to stand trial. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Medina v. California,</i> 505 U.S. 437, 439, 112 S.Ct. 2572, 120 L.Ed.2d 353 (1992). The test for competence is uncontroversial; the accused, before and during the trial, must have \"sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\" and must possess \"a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\" <i>Dusky,</i> 362 U.S. at 402, 80 S.Ct. 788; <i>see </i><i>United States v. Pellerito,</i> 878 F.2d 1535, 1544 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n<p>The petitioner in this case makes a different kind of competency claim. She does not impugn her capacity to have understood the nature and import of the proceedings against her and to have communicated with her counsel on most subjects. She claims instead that the competence standard was infringed by her inability to communicate the facts touching upon her abuse to her lawyers. The state court motions justice questioned her overall credibility. The district court took a more empathetic view, finding that severe and pervasive abuse had occurred. But that court, too, rejected the petitioner's claim, concluding that she had retained the ability to communicate the abuse to her lawyers in the months leading up to the trial.</p>\n<p>Taking the full sweep of the evidentiary record into account, <i>see supra</i> Part III, we focus on the district court's factual findings (rather than those of the state court). That focus, combined with the absence of a state court decision on the competence claim, alters the normal AEDPA standard of review and makes this case procedurally more like a direct criminal appeal. Thus, we will uphold the district court's determination of competence made after an evidentiary hearing unless that determination is clearly erroneous. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Santos,</i> 131 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir.1997). That standard is quite deferential; a finding of fact is clearly erroneous only when, upon a thorough assessment of the record, the reviewing court is left with an abiding conviction that a mistake has been made. <i>United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co.,</i> 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948); <i>Ferrara v. United States,</i> 456 F.3d 278, 287 (1st Cir. 2006). Given the independent factfinding that took place here and the intensely fact-based nature of competency inquiries, <i>see </i><i>Drope v. Missouri,</i> 420 U.S. 162, 180, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975), we see no reason to deviate from this deferential standard of review. <i>See supra</i> Part II.</p>\n<p>Of course, an assertion of legal error still engenders de novo review. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Wiggin,</i> 429 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir.2005). Here, however, neither party suggests that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard in adjudicating the issue of competence. Consequently, we train the lens of our inquiry on two matters: the district court's factual findings and the question of whether those findings supported its ultimate conclusion.</p>\n<p>At the end of the federal evidentiary hearing, the district court credited large portions of the petitioner's testimony and found that she had been subject to severe and pervasive abuse prior to her pretrial incarceration. The court also found that some emotional abuse had continued during her immurement. Notwithstanding these (favorable) findings, the court concluded that the petitioner had been able, throughout the pretrial period <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> and the trial itself, to communicate the abuse to her lawyers, but had made an affirmative decision not to broach that topic. In the court's view, the petitioner, \"at the relevant times,\" was not \"incapable of choice.\" Indeed, the petitioner had a \"sufficient and then present ability to consult with her attorneys\" with a reasonable degree of rational understanding. Therefore, she was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p>The district court's ultimate conclusion is amply supported by the record. The court picked its way carefully through a tangled evidentiary thicket. It took issue with some of the state court's findings, credited much of the petitioner's testimony, and gave credence to her expert's opinion that she had experienced battered woman's syndrome. At the same time, however, the court discounted significant portions of her testimony, including her claims of abuse suffered as a child, her claim that she had attempted to raise the issue of abuse with her attorneys at one point during the state court proceedings, and her various versions of the events that transpired on the day of the murder. In the end, the court found that the petitioner had not proved that an inability to communicate existed at the critical time.</p>\n<p>The court was fully entitled to accept parts of the testimony of the petitioner and her experts yet reject the ultimate conclusion that they advocated. <i>See </i><i>Wiggin,</i> 429 F.3d at 37; <i>Santos,</i> 131 F.3d at 20-21; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Alicea,</i> 205 F.3d 480, 483 (1st Cir.2000) (explaining that a factfinder \"has the prerogative to credit some parts of a witness's testimony and disregard other potentially contradictory portions\"). Certain features of this case reinforce that entitlement.</p>\n<p>For one thing, the story that the petitioner told at trial in the state court did not jibe with Loring's account but, rather, incriminated him. It seems logical to infer that, had the petitioner been completely under Loring's spell at that time, her testimony would have been more in tune with his. <i>Cf. </i><i>State v. Kelly,</i> 97 N.J. 178, 478 A.2d 364, 372 (1984) (noting that victims of battered woman's syndrome have a tendency to accept responsibility for the batterer's actions).</p>\n<p>For another thing, the logistics of the relationship between Loring and the petitioner were dramatically altered from and after their arrests. Both he and she were incarcerated for nearly a year prior to trial. They were housed on separate floors, and neither of them was free to move at will about the jail. The petitioner constructed an elaborate theory of how Loring was able to exert continued dominion over her during this interval and the district court seems to have bought into that theory. Even so, Loring's control over Pike plainly was palliated by their lack of physical proximity. <i>See </i><i>McMaugh v. State,</i> 612 A.2d 725, 728, 730 (R.I.1992) (deeming continuous contact relevant to the conclusion that battered woman's syndrome rendered defendant unable to communicate her abuse). The district court's ultimate conclusion  that the petitioner, during this period, retained the ability to make a real choice about whether to disclose the details of their relationship to her counsel  seems to us a tacit recognition that Loring's control had abated.</p>\n<p>Then, too, other straws in the wind pointed to the petitioner's competency to stand trial. For example, the district court heard testimony from one of the petitioner's trial attorneys. This seasoned criminal defense lawyer harbored no doubt about the petitioner's competence at the time of trial. He reported that the petitioner responded alertly and appropriately to questions, testified articulately, and took an active part in her own defense. This testimony was borne out by the transcript <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> of the state court trial and by other evidence of the petitioner's active participation in her defense, including evidence that the petitioner had written letters to her attorneys during her incarceration.</p>\n<p>The court also heard the testimony of Loring's defense counsel, who described the petitioner, in the relevant time frame, as \"calm\" and \"collected.\" In addition, the Commonwealth adduced evidence that, as compared to Loring, the petitioner seemed \"the stronger of the two individuals in th[e] situation that they were both in.\"</p>\n<p>Although the petitioner offered explanations to counter many of these items, the district court was in no way bound either to accept those explanations or to ignore the Commonwealth's evidence. In the final analysis, it was wholly within the factfinder's province to resolve these contradictions and to choose among the conflicting inferences that the evidence suggested. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gobbi,</i> 471 F.3d 302, 311 (1st Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Ortiz,</i> 966 F.2d 707, 713 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n<p>In an attempt to salvage the competence claim, the petitioner cites several cases in which battered woman's syndrome has been the basis for questioning a defendant's competence. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Commonwealth v. Conaghan,</i> 433 Mass. 105, 740 N.E.2d 956, 960 (2000); <i>McMaugh,</i> 612 A.2d at 732. This is something of a red herring; these cases stand for nothing more than the now-unremarkable proposition that battered woman's syndrome can in certain circumstances render a criminal defendant incompetent. The district court recognized this proposition (as do we) but found it inapplicable in this situation. As we have said, that fact-specific determination was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p>That resolves this aspect of the matter. After hearing extensive testimony  perhaps more than it should have heard, <i>see supra</i> Part III  and carefully reviewing an amplitudinous record, the district court made a factual finding that the petitioner, at and before her trial, had the ability to consult and communicate with her counsel and to assist in her defense. That finding may be arguable, but we have no abiding conviction that it was wrong. The finding is, therefore, entitled to deference. <i>See </i><i>Ferrara,</i> 456 F.3d at 287; <i>Wiggin,</i> 429 F.3d at 37. It follows that the district court did not err in rejecting the competence claim.</p>\n<p>V. THE INVOLUNTARY WAIVER CLAIM</p>\n<p>We next address the petitioner's claim that the effects of the abuse, when combined with Loring's continued coercive control over her, forced her to forgo asserting battered woman's syndrome as a defense and, thus, violated her constitutional rights. The petitioner constructs this portion of her argument in two layers.</p>\n<p>The foundation is a line of Supreme Court cases that speak to an accused's constitutional right to present a defense. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rock v. Arkansas,</i> 483 U.S. 44, 51, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 97 L.Ed.2d 37 (1987); <i>Crane v. Kentucky,</i> 476 U.S. 683, 690, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986); <i>Chambers v. Mississippi,</i> 410 U.S. 284, 302, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973); <i>Washington v. Texas,</i> 388 U.S. 14, 18-19, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967). But these cases are not directly applicable; the petitioner's right to present the battered woman's syndrome defense, if infringed at all, was infringed by Loring, not by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p>In an effort to overcome this obstacle, the petitioner adds the next forensic layer. That layer builds on cases which, in her view, indicate that, even in the absence of state action, the right to present a defense <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> may be abridged either by the conduct of a private party, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Nichols v. Butler,</i> 953 F.2d 1550, 1552 (11th Cir.1992) (en banc); <i>United States v. Teague,</i> 953 F.2d 1525, 1532 (11th Cir.1992) (en banc); <i>United States v. Butts,</i> 630 F.Supp. 1145, 1147-49 (D.Me.1986), or by an accused's own physical or mental condition, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Ferrarini,</i> 219 F.3d 145, 151 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>The district court voiced understandable skepticism about whether involuntary waiver of a particular defense could constitute a separate habeas claim. This may explain why the court did not specifically rule on this claim in its <i>ore sponte</i> denial of the habeas petition. We need not belabor the point. The <i>availability</i> of the claim as a ground for habeas relief is a question of law  and one that the state courts did not directly address. Accordingly, our review is de novo. <i>See </i><i>Fortini,</i> 257 F.3d at 47.</p>\n<p>At first blush, this \"involuntary waiver\" claim may seem like nothing more than a recasting of the competence claim. But competence and voluntariness are separate (though complementary) inquiries. \"The focus of a competency inquiry is the defendant's mental capacity\" whereas the focus of a voluntariness inquiry is on \"whether the defendant actually <i>does</i> understand the significance and consequences of a particular decision and whether the decision is uncoerced.\" <i>Godinez v. Moran,</i> 509 U.S. 389, 401 n. 12, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993).</p>\n<p>Although the right to present a defense is of constitutional dimension,<sup>[8]</sup> it is not absolute. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Nix v. Whiteside,</i> 475 U.S. 157, 173, 106 S.Ct. 988, 89 L.Ed.2d 123 (1986) (recognizing that the right does not extend to committing perjury). Accordingly, the Supreme Court has tended to recognize the right in carefully defined contexts. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Crane,</i> 476 U.S. at 690, 106 S.Ct. 2142 (finding a violation of the right when the state precluded the defendant's use of \"competent, reliable evidence . . . central to the defendant's claim of innocence\"); <i>Washington,</i> 388 U.S. at 18-19, 87 S.Ct. 1920 (indicating that a denial of the right to compulsory process would be a denial of the right to present a defense).</p>\n<p>None of this gets the petitioner very far. Unless the accused's right to present a defense is infringed <i>by state action,</i> the infringement is not redressable by a federal court charged with vindicating federal constitutional rights. As a general proposition, the Fourteenth Amendment protects individuals exclusively against government action, leaving the conduct of private parties to regulation by statutory and common law. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rendell-Baker v. Kohn,</i> 457 U.S. 830, 837, 102 S.Ct. 2764, 73 L.Ed.2d 418 (1982); <i>Logiodice v. Trs. of Me. Cent. Inst.,</i> 296 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p>This is an unsurmountable barrier to the petitioner's involuntary waiver claim. In mounting that claim, she does not assign the Commonwealth any responsibility for thwarting her right to present a defense.<sup>[9]</sup> She alleges only that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> Loring, a private party, interfered with her exercise of that right through his abusive and coercive behavior. That infringement, even if it transpired, does not pave the way for federal habeas relief.</p>\n<p>The several \"private party\" cases cited by the petitioner do not suggest a way around this barrier. Each of those cases involved coercion by the accused's attorney and turned on a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. <i>See </i><i>Nichols,</i> 953 F.2d at 1552; <i>Teague,</i> 953 F.2d at 1534; <i>Butts,</i> 630 F.Supp. at 1147-49. That is a recognized violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and, thus, an independent basis for federal habeas relief. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <i>Ouber v. Guarino,</i> 293 F.3d 19, 35-36 (1st Cir.2002). The petitioner in this case makes no comparable claim.</p>\n<p>The petitioner's contention that a physical or mental condition, not attributable to state action, may work a violation of an accused's constitutional right to present a defense is wishful thinking. The single case that she cites in support of that proposition is far off the point. In that case, the defendant argued that the denial of his motion for either a severance or a continuance following a heart attack deprived him of his constitutional right to testify. <i>See </i><i>Ferrarini,</i> 219 F.3d at 151. As such, the constitutional claim was focused not on the defendant's physical condition but, rather, on the district court's decision to forge ahead with the trial despite knowledge of the defendant's infirmity  a decision that plainly constituted state action. <i>See </i><i>Shelley v. Kraemer,</i> 334 U.S. 1, 14, 68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948) (deeming \"long [ ] established\" the proposition that the actions of state courts and judicial officers in their official capacities constitute state action).</p>\n<p>The short of the matter is that the petitioner invites us to find a constitutional violation (separate and distinct from ineffective assistance of counsel) in the infringement of an accused's right to present a defense by a private party alone, without any awareness (actual or imputed) of that infringement by a state actor. We decline her invitation.<sup>[10]</sup> We emphasize that, in doing so, we do not hold that an infringement of this right by a private party may never result in a constitutional violation; this case does not require us to sweep so broadly. We do hold that the petitioner's involuntary waiver claim, as formulated here, is not cognizable as a separate and distinct ground for federal habeas relief.</p>\n<p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p>We summarize succinctly. Because the Commonwealth waived its defense of nonexhaustion and failed to establish a defense of procedural default, we have considered the merits of the petitioner's claim <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> that she was incompetent to stand trial in the state court. We find the district court's fact-bound rejection of that claim to be supportable.</p>\n<p>The petitioner's remaining initiative  her claim of involuntary waiver  lacks legal footing and, thus, does not open a separate avenue for federal habeas relief. We need go no further.</p>\n<p><i>We reject both the petitioner's appeal (No. 06-1019) and the Commonwealth's cross-appeal (No. 06-1020). The judgment of the district court is affirmed. No costs.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Battered woman's syndrome has been described as a \"series of common characteristics that appear in women who are abused physically and psychologically over an extended period of time by the dominant male figure in their lives.\" <i>State v. Kelly,</i> 97 N.J. 178, 478 A.2d 364, 371 (1984). One of these characteristics is a type of learned helplessness, through which the woman believes that the batterer has complete control of the relationship and that she cannot escape. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brown,</i> 891 F.Supp. 1501, 1505 (D.Kan.1995). Women suffering from the syndrome often have a difficult time disclosing the abuse; \"it is the nature of [the] illness to conceal its existence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1510.</p>\n<p>[2]  During its four-year odyssey in the district court, the petitioner's case was assigned at different times to different judges. Rather than matching each ruling with each judge, we take an institutional view and refer only to the decisions of the district court.</p>\n<p>[3]  Some courts have indicated that an \"independent review\" standard should guide the evaluation of mixed questions of fact and law in habeas cases. <i>See </i><i>Scarpa,</i> 38 F.3d at 9 n. 5 (collecting cases); <i>see also</i> 2 Childress &amp; Davis, <i>supra</i> § 13.06, at 13-50. We do not linger over this question because independent review involves roughly the same tamisage that we have outlined here; that is, significant deference to factbound determinations and little or no deference to law-based determinations. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Tortora,</i> 922 F.2d 880, 882-83 (1st Cir.1990); <i>see also </i><i>Scarpa,</i> 38 F.3d at 9 n. 5 (bypassing inquiry for similar reasons).</p>\n<p>[4]  In the court below, the petitioner argued that the state court's factual findings were not entitled to a presumption of correctness because they were unreasonable in light of the evidence presented. She based this argument on the notion that AEDPA sections 2254(d)(2) and (e)(1) operate in tandem. To support that notion, she cited our opinion in <i>Mastracchio v. Vose,</i> 274 F.3d 590, 597-98 (1st Cir.2001). The district court did not accept this hypothesis but, before us, the petitioner does not allege any harm resulting from the district court's refusal. Consequently, it is unnecessary for us to test this hypothesis.</p>\n<p>[5]  The lawyers did testify during the state court hearing, but at the Commonwealth's instance.</p>\n<p>[6]  For example, such hearings are often useful when the federal habeas court is asked to consider a claim based on ineffective assistance of state court counsel. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Bryan,</i> 335 F.3d at 1215.</p>\n<p>[7]  It is worth noting that, in the end, we find the competence claim wanting. <i>See infra</i> Part IV(B). When a federal court grants habeas relief on an unexhausted claim, comity concerns are greater than when it denies relief on such a claim. <i>See </i><i>Jones v. Jones,</i> 163 F.3d 285, 299 (5th Cir.1998); <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(2) (authorizing a federal court to deny unexhausted habeas claims on the merits).</p>\n<p>[8]  The petitioner seems uncertain whether the right that she asserts is rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or in the Sixth Amendment as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>See</i> Petitioner's Br. at 49. Because we find no violation of any cognizable constitutional right, we need not untangle this knot.</p>\n<p>[9]  Although the petitioner cites an occasional case indicating that trial courts have an affirmative duty to prevent the involuntary waiver of certain rights, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Johnson v. Zerbst,</i> 304 U.S. 458, 464-65, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938) (discussing waivers of right to counsel), she has not argued that the state trial court should have conducted some particularized inquiry in <i>her</i> case; nor does she identify what would have put the court on notice of the need to conduct such an inquiry. Where, as here, an appellant has merely hinted obliquely at an argument but has not advanced it distinctly, that argument is not in the case. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones.\").</p>\n<p>[10]  It bears mentioning that, even if we were to recognize this new type of constitutional violation, we would likely be barred from granting habeas relief on this claim under the familiar doctrine of <i>Teague v. Lane,</i> 489 U.S. 288, 310, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989) (plurality opinion). For two reasons  because Pike has made a colorable claim that the Commonwealth waived the <i>Teague</i> issue below and because the merits of this claim are relatively clear-cut  we have elected to bypass an in-depth <i>Teague</i> analysis. <i>See </i><i>Campiti v. Matesanz,</i> 333 F.3d 317, 321-22 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n\n</div>",

In the principal appeal, the petitioner  who portrays herself as a victim of battered woman's syndrome  urges us to reverse the denial of habeas relief and hold that she lacked competency to stand trial in the state court or, alternatively, that she involuntarily waived her right to present a viable theory of defense. In the cross-appeal, the respondent (the superintendent of the state correctional facility in which the petitioner is confined) urges us to revisit the district court's determinations concerning exhaustion of state remedies and the granting of a federal evidentiary hearing, as well as to consider a nascent theory of procedural default. After working our way through a procedural <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> quagmire, examining a mountain of paper, and studying a complex set of legal issues, we reject both appeals and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p>This case has a lengthy and tortured history. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (the SJC) has accurately recounted the evidence presented at the petitioner's trial and in the subsequent state court proceedings. <i>See </i><i>Commonwealth v. Pike,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">726</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span></span>, 942-51 (2000) (<i>Pike I</i>). We assume the reader's familiarity with that opinion, rehearse here only those details that are directly relevant to our analysis, and amplify that account to reflect evidence presented before the federal habeas court.</p>\n<p>In 1995, a Massachusetts jury found the petitioner, Julie A. Pike, guilty of second-degree murder. This conviction resulted from the interaction of the petitioner and her swain, Barry Loring, with Don Maynard. As part and parcel of what began as a plan to steal a car, Maynard was slain in his Greenfield home. The murder occurred in 1994 and suspicion soon centered on Loring and the petitioner.</p>\n<p>Loring agreed to plead guilty and became the Commonwealth's star witness at his former girlfriend's trial. He vouchsafed that the pair had broken into Maynard's abode together; that they then agreed that Loring would kill Maynard using a gun discovered inside the house; but that, when Maynard returned home earlier than anticipated, an altercation between the two men ensued. According to Loring, the petitioner ended the scuffle by killing Maynard with a shot to the back of the head.</p>\n<p>In addition to Loring's eyewitness testimony, the Commonwealth presented substantial physical evidence linking the petitioner to Maynard's home; evidence that she had fled with Loring; proof that she had sold some of Maynard's property at a pawn shop; and testimony from Loring's cellmate that tended to corroborate Loring's account of the relevant events.</p>\n<p>The petitioner testified in her own defense. She admitted to her entanglement in the overall events, but maintained that she had not been present in the Maynard residence at the time of the homicide. Instead  following Loring's instructions  she had waited at a nearby bridge. Thus, the petitioner argued that her participation was limited to helping Loring clean up after the murder and dispose of Maynard's lifeless body.</p>\n<p>At the close of all the evidence, the jury rejected the petitioner's version and found her guilty of second-degree murder. The trial justice sentenced her to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p>During the pendency of the petitioner's direct appeal, she moved for a new trial. <i>See</i> Mass. R.Crim. P. 30(b). The gravamen of her motion was that the severely abusive nature of her relationship with Loring had allowed him to control her both at the time of the murder and thereafter (up to and including the time of trial). She explained that Loring was able to exert dominion over her after their arrest because the two were detained at the same jail (albeit on different floors), which permitted extraordinary levels of contact between them. In addition, the petitioner had been seven months pregnant at the time of the murder, Loring was the father, and he had minimally supervised visits with their infant child during his pretrial incarceration. The petitioner claimed that Loring used these visits as leverage against her, threatening to harm the child if she did not do his bidding.</p>\n<p>With this predicate in place, the petitioner maintained that she was under the spell <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> of Loring's pervasive influence until after the trial. Through that circumstance, he had coerced her into giving a fabricated version of the events surrounding the Maynard homicide. She proceeded to recant portions of her trial testimony. The petitioner admitted that she had been in the house prior to Maynard's death but continued to assert that she had not committed the murder.</p>\n<p>Taking matters a step further, the petitioner maintained that the combination of Loring's continued coercion and the cumulative psychological effects of the abuse (amounting to what is commonly known as battered woman's syndrome) rendered her incapable of disclosing the abuse to her attorneys at the time of trial.<sup>[1]</sup> In her view, both the revelation of the abuse and her changed testimony qualified as newly discovered evidence. <i>See </i><i>Commonwealth v. Grace,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2232619\"><a href=\"/opinion/2232619/commonwealth-v-grace/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2232619\"><a href=\"/opinion/2232619/commonwealth-v-grace/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span>, 248 (1986). Furthermore, on her assessment of the case, this newly discovered evidence would have affected the outcome of the trial because it would have allowed her to explain that whatever actions she took on the day of Maynard's demise were taken under duress (i.e., coerced by Loring).</p>\n<p>The original trial justice had retired, so a different judicial officer (whom, for ease in exposition, we shall refer to as the state court motions justice) held a four-day evidentiary hearing to supplement the affidavits and psychiatric reports submitted with the petitioner's motion. The hearing included testimony from the petitioner, the therapist who had begun to treat her, the lawyers who had represented her at trial, and Dr. Prudence Baxter (an expert on battered woman's syndrome). At the conclusion of the hearing, the state court motions justice denied the motion in a strongly-worded opinion. <i>Commonwealth v. Pike,</i> No. 94-091, slip op. at 2 (Mass.Super.Ct. Apr. 8, 1998) (unpublished). We offer a synopsis of the findings upon which that decision rested.</p>\n<p>While assuming that evidence of battered woman's syndrome could in some cases support the granting of a new trial, the state court motions justice found the petitioner's version of events \"implausible\" and her testimony \"unreliable,\" especially with respect to the degree of control that Loring exerted over her during their pretrial incarceration. <i>Id.</i> at 13. Specifically, the state court justice concluded that \"[w]hile it [was] likely that [the petitioner] was subjected to some of the described acts [of abuse], at least up to the point of her incarceration, it [did] not follow that [she] meekly surrendered to Loring's inescapable control at the time of her trial.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The petitioner filed motions seeking reconsideration and leave to expand the record. <i>See</i> Mass. R.Crim. P. 13(a)(5). In connection therewith, she proffered affidavits from correctional officers employed at the jail where she and Loring had been detained prior to trial. The state court motions justice summarily denied these motions.</p>\n<p>The SJC allowed the petitioner's application for direct appellate review. <i>See</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> Mass. R.Crim. P. 30(c)(8). It subsequently affirmed both the conviction and the denial of the petitioner's post-trial motions. <i>See </i><i>Pike I,</i> 726 N.E.2d at 942. With respect to the new trial motion, the SJC confirmed that, under Massachusetts law, evidence of battered women's syndrome could constitute newly discovered evidence warranting a new trial. <i>Id.</i> at 948. Here, however, the petitioner's quest for a new trial was properly thwarted because the state court motions justice had made a supportable credibility determination  she simply did not believe that the petitioner suffered from the ravages of the syndrome during the period leading up to the trial. <i>Id.</i> at 949, 951. To cinch matters, the SJC held that the motions justice was not unreasonable in refusing to consider the additional affidavits. <i>See id.</i> at 951.</p>\n<p>Having been rebuffed by the SJC, the petitioner repaired to the federal district court and filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254. Of her several asserted grounds for relief, only two are pertinent here: (i) that battered woman's syndrome had rendered her incompetent to stand trial in state court and (ii) that her inability to disclose Loring's abuse to her trial counsel constituted an involuntary waiver of her constitutional right to present a defense.</p>\n<p>After some procedural skirmishing (to which we shortly shall return), the district court, without any detailed explanation, ordered an evidentiary hearing.<sup>[2]</sup> The hearing extended over eight days. The petitioner presented much of the same evidence that she had presented at the state court hearing on her new trial motion: her own testimony as to Loring's abuse, other testimony and affidavits corroborating the abuse, testimony from one of her lawyers, Dr. Baxter's testimony, and testimony from various therapists. The respondent (who, for ease of exposition, we shall call \"the Commonwealth\") produced several rebuttal witnesses, including Loring's trial attorney and its own psychiatric expert.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court, ruling from the bench, denied the petition. These timely appeals followed. The district court has granted a certificate of appealability as to all issues. <i>See id.</i> § 2253(c).</p>\n<p>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p>In this case, appellate review is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214. The AEDPA permits federal courts to grant habeas relief after a final state adjudication of a federal constitutional claim only if that adjudication:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p>28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). This standard applies, however, only to a \"claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> If the federal claim was never addressed by the state court, federal review is de novo. <i>See </i><i>Fortini v. Murphy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199512\"><a href=\"/opinion/199512/fortini-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that a federal court \"can hardly defer to the state court on an issue that the state court did not address\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> In this instance, it is undisputed that the SJC did not address either of the petitioner's current claims on the merits. To the extent, then, that these claims were properly before the district court  more on this later  the district court correctly subjected them to de novo review. The court also correctly recognized that the AEDPA sets out a separate and exacting standard applicable to review of a state court's factual findings. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1); <i>Sanna v. Dipaolo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199590\"><a href=\"/opinion/199590/sanna-v-dipaulo/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>As a general matter, the same standards that courts of appeals use in direct review of criminal convictions apply to appellate review of the decisions of federal district courts in state prisoner habeas cases. <i>See</i> 2 Steven Alan Childress &amp; Martha S. Davis, Federal Standards of Review § 13.06, at 13-50 (3d ed.1999). These include de novo review of legal issues and of most mixed questions of fact and law. <i>See </i><i>Scarpa v. DuBois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"680706\"><a href=\"/opinion/680706/nazzaro-scarpa-v-larry-e-dubois-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1994). We say \"most\" because appellate review of mixed questions depends, in the last analysis, on the extent to which a particular question is fact-dominated or law-dominated.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See id.</i>; <i>see also </i><i>In re Extradition of Howard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610553\"><a href=\"/opinion/610553/in-re-extradition-of-curtis-andrew-howard-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1320</span></a></span>, 1328 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>When the district court undertakes no independent factfinding in a habeas case, we are effectively in the same position as the district court vis-à-vis the state court record and have the ability to review that record from the same vantage point. Consequently, the district court's recension of that record will engender de novo review. <i>See </i><i>Breest v. Perrin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"379996\"><a href=\"/opinion/379996/robert-breest-v-everett-i-perrin-jr-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">624</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1112</span></a></span>, 1115 (1st Cir.1980); 2 Childress &amp; Davis, <i>supra</i> § 13.06, at 13-50. When, however, the district court has held an evidentiary hearing and made new or different findings of fact, those findings are entitled to significant deference. <i>See </i><i>Scarpa,</i> 38 F.3d at 9 n. 5; <i>see also </i><i>McNair v. Campbell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77026\"><a href=\"/opinion/77026/willie-mcnair-v-donal-campbell/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1291</span></a></span>, 1297 (11th Cir.2005); <i>McGregor v. Gibson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773088\"><a href=\"/opinion/773088/billy-keith-mcgregor-v-gary-gibson-warden-oklahoma-state-penitentiary/\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">946</span></a></span>, 951 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>III. THE HABEAS RECORD</p>\n<p>As a prelude to our analysis of the petitioner's claims, we deem it prudent to say something about the factual record that underpins our review. Although a magistrate judge recommended the opposite course of action, the district court granted a full-scale evidentiary hearing. That hearing had no apparent limits. It lasted nearly twice as long as the pertinent state court evidentiary hearing held seven years earlier, covered the same factual ground, and involved much of the same evidence.</p>\n<p>Despite this similitude, the district court evaluated the evidence somewhat differently than had the state court motions justice. It took a more flattering view of the petitioner's credibility and made several factual findings that contradicted those of the state court motions justice. The district court justified these contrary findings on the ground that, in the course of the federal evidentiary hearing, its view of the underlying facts had been proven by clear and convincing evidence  a standard <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> dictated by the AEDPA. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The Commonwealth asseverates that the district court erred in granting a full-scale evidentiary hearing and beseeches us to disregard its factual findings. This is more than empty rhetoric: unless a state prisoner meets certain stringent requirements, the AEDPA prohibits a federal court from granting an evidentiary hearing when \"the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> § 2254(e)(2).</p>\n<p>Seizing upon this prohibition, the Commonwealth argues that the petitioner, in the state courts, failed to develop the factual record needed to underbrace her habeas claims. In this vein, the Commonwealth notes that, at the state court evidentiary hearing, the petitioner did not call the lawyers who represented her at trial<sup>[5]</sup> and elected to submit affidavits in lieu of much of the live testimony that she presented at the federal evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p>The petitioner rejoins on several fronts. First, she argues that she did not fail to develop the factual basis for her claims because the key <i>facts</i>  those pertaining to the abuse and her consequent inability to disclose that abuse to her trial counsel  were presented to the state court (albeit in lesser detail). Thus, a federal evidentiary hearing was not statutorily prohibited. Second, she emphasizes that, in interpreting section 2254(e)(2), the Supreme Court has equated the \"failure to develop\" language with \"a lack of diligence, or some greater fault, attributable to the prisoner or prisoner's counsel.\" <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118356\"><a href=\"/opinion/118356/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span>, 432, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118356\"><a href=\"/opinion/118356/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1479</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118356\"><a href=\"/opinion/118356/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (2000). Such diligence embodies, \"at a minimum, seek[ing] an evidentiary hearing in state court in the manner prescribed by state law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 437, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118356\"><a href=\"/opinion/118356/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1479</span></a></span>. Because she sought and received an evidentiary hearing in the state court, the petitioner maintains that she satisfied the diligence standard. Third, the petitioner asserts that the presentation of additional evidence in the federal court is unimpugnable because, under prevailing jurisprudence, she had the right to augment the record on habeas review. <i>See</i> 1 Randy Hertz &amp; James S. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure § 20.2b, at 906 n. 21 (5th ed.2005). And, finally, the petitioner argues that the district court was <i>required</i> to grant her request for an evidentiary hearing under <i>Townsend v. Sain,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106544\"><a href=\"/opinion/106544/townsend-v-sain/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span>, 312-13, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106544\"><a href=\"/opinion/106544/townsend-v-sain/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106544\"><a href=\"/opinion/106544/townsend-v-sain/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span> (1963).</p>\n<p>As a matter of statutory law, we reject the Commonwealth's importunings. Here, the petitioner adduced extensive evidence in the state court. The exact manner in which she elected to make the point is less important than the fact that she did make the point; her proffer went directly to the merits of the claims that she later sought to pursue in the federal court proceedings. We conclude, therefore, that the district court was not statutorily prohibited from taking evidence on those claims. <i>See </i><i>Bryan v. Mullin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782701\"><a href=\"/opinion/782701/robert-leroy-bryan-v-mike-mullin-warden-oklahoma-state-penitentiary/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1207</span></a></span>, 1215 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> (10th Cir.2003) (holding federal evidentiary hearing not statutorily barred when petitioner had sought to develop factual basis for claim in state court); <i>Matheney v. Anderson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773675\"><a href=\"/opinion/773675/alan-l-matheney-v-rondle-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1025</span></a></span>, 1039 (7th Cir. 2001) (similar).</p>\n<p>The fact that a federal evidentiary hearing was not statutorily barred does not mean that one was <i>required.</i> The decision to hold the hearing and the scale and scope of it are subject to review for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Crooker v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484939\"><a href=\"/opinion/484939/stephen-scott-crooker-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 76 n. 1 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n<p>In this instance, we find the scale and scope of the hearing problematic. Federal habeas is a collateral proceeding; particularly after AEDPA, it is not intended to provide a forum in which to retry state cases. <i>See </i><i>Bell v. Cone,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118509\"><a href=\"/opinion/118509/bell-v-cone/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span>, 693, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118509\"><a href=\"/opinion/118509/bell-v-cone/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1843</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118509\"><a href=\"/opinion/118509/bell-v-cone/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span> (2002). Consequently, in state prisoner habeas cases in which the applicant was afforded a full and fair hearing in state court, federal evidentiary hearings ought to be the exception, not the rule. <i>See </i><i>Townsend,</i> 372 U.S. at 314, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106544\"><a href=\"/opinion/106544/townsend-v-sain/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span>; <i>see also</i> 1 Hertz &amp; Liebman, <i>supra</i> § 20.1, at 887 n. 3 (noting that evidentiary hearings are allowed in less than 2% of all habeas filings). Even when such a hearing is thought desirable, restraint should be the watchword.</p>\n<p>Here, the state court had conducted a full and fair evidentiary hearing. Moreover, the federal court's chosen course of action led to extensive duplication of effort. When a federal court opts to hold an evidentiary hearing in a state habeas case, the prototypical purpose should be to fill a gap in the record or to supplement the record on a specific point.<sup>[6]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>López v.

The federal hearing was at the petitioner's instance and for her benefit. Yet (as we explain below), even taking this additional evidence and the district court's factual findings fully into account, the petitioner's claims cannot succeed. Any error in holding a full-scale evidentiary hearing was, therefore, harmless. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gonzales v. Quarterman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"44497\"><a href=\"/opinion/44497/gonzales-v-quarterman/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span>, 394 (5th Cir.2006); <i>Greiner v.

Accordingly, we bypass the question of whether the district court abused its discretion and consider its factual findings.</p>\n<p>IV. THE COMPETENCE CLAIM</p>\n<p>The petitioner's flagship claim is that the district court erred in determining that she was competent to stand trial in the state court. The Commonwealth attempts to head off any substantive consideration of this claim through the interposition of nonexhaustion and procedural default defenses. Because we may affirm the district court's denial of habeas relief on any ground made manifest by the record, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Cabrera-Polo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201164\"><a href=\"/opinion/201164/united-states-v-cabrera-polo/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2004); <i>InterGen N.V. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span> (1986). Consequently, federal courts are, in most instances, barred from granting habeas relief on a particular claim unless the petitioner has exhausted the remedies available to her in state court with respect to that claim. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A); <i>see also </i><i>Jackson v.

But exhaustion is a prudential principle rather than a jurisdictional limitation, so a state may waive the defense of nonexhaustion. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(3); <i>see also </i><i>Granberry v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (1984).</p>\n<p>The district court expressed grave doubt that the petitioner's competence claim had been exhausted in the state courts. It determined, however, that the Commonwealth had waived this defense. The court based that determination on the sequence of events described below.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the petitioner docketed her habeas petition, the Commonwealth moved to dismiss the competence claim (among others) as unexhausted. The petitioner opposed the motion. In support of her opposition, she tendered various briefs that she had filed with the SJC. After mulling her response, the Commonwealth moved to withdraw its motion to dismiss. The withdrawal motion stated in pertinent part: \"Having reviewed the[] materials, undersigned counsel believes that the petitioner is correct in her assertion that [the] claims presented in Grounds <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> one through three of her petition have been exhausted.\" This concession encompassed the competence claim (ground one in the habeas petition).</p>\n<p>It is hornbook law that waivers of exhaustion will not lightly be inferred but, rather, must be clear and explicit. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(3) (mandating that state must \"expressly\" waive exhaustion); <i>Mercadel v. Cain,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"17688\"><a href=\"/opinion/17688/mercadel-v-cain/\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span>, 276 (5th Cir. 1999) (finding implicit waiver of exhaustion \"not determinative\" because waiver must be express). The waiver here satisfies that rigorous standard; it was unmistakably clear.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the clarity of the language that it employed, the Commonwealth now suggests that it did not really waive its nonexhaustion defense. It tries to justify this tergiversation by pointing out that the petitioner refined her competence claim at a later date (when she served a memorandum of law in support of her habeas petition). Had it been apprised of the exact dimensions of the competence claim that was embedded in ground one of the petition, the Commonwealth protests, it never would have agreed that the claim was exhausted.</p>\n<p>The district court rejected this suggestion. It ruled that the Commonwealth, which was on notice from the commencement of the habeas proceedings that the petitioner was raising a competence claim, had knowingly and voluntarily abandoned the exhaustion defense. We agree with this assessment.</p>\n<p>The habeas petition states, as its first ground for relief, that the petitioner's conviction was \"obtained at trial where petitioner was unable to meaningfully consult and communicate effectively with counsel.\" This language echoes a familiar formulation of the test for competence to stand trial. <i>See </i><i>Cooper v. Oklahoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118018\"><a href=\"/opinion/118018/cooper-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span>, 368, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118018\"><a href=\"/opinion/118018/cooper-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span> (1960) (per curiam) (defining competence in part as the \"present ability to consult with [a] lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\"). It put the Commonwealth squarely on notice that the petitioner was asserting a competence claim  and the Commonwealth proceeded <i>unreservedly</i> to waive nonexhaustion as a defense to that claim.</p>\n<p>That was game, set, and match. Waiver typically is thought to be the voluntary relinquishment of a known right. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Olano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 733, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (1993). It is no secret that waivers are strong medicine, not casually to be dispensed. A party who chooses to waive a defense surrenders that defense as to the claim asserted and any claim fairly encompassed within it. <i>Cf. </i><i>New York v. AMRO Realty Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563777\"><a href=\"/opinion/563777/state-of-new-york-v-amro-realty-corporation-harry-moskowitz-and-david/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1420</span></a></span>, 1430 &amp; n. 10 (2d Cir.1991) (holding that in waiving a late-notice defense, insurer waived that defense as to any claim arising out of the occurrence in question). In other words, the waiver extends to the claim stated and any variants of the claim that are readily ascertainable from the language of the petition or complaint. The waiving party cannot play the ostrich, burying its head in the sand and struthiously ignoring that which ought to be obvious.</p>\n<p>The competence claim pursued by the petitioner was well within the compass of the language contained in ground one of the habeas petition. The fact that the Commonwealth came to regret its waiver is not a sufficient reason to allow rescission of the waiver. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Dorsey v. Chapman,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></span>, 1187 (11th Cir.2001) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> (declining to allow the state to resurrect exhaustion defense when it had expressly declined to raise the defense in the district court, even though the state claimed that its earlier declination was based on a mistaken belief); <i>Bledsue v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765757\"><a href=\"/opinion/765757/larry-lee-bledsue-v-gary-l-johnson-director-texas-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span>, 254 (5th Cir.1999) (finding that state had waived nonexhaustion defense by admitting in its original answer that the petitioner had exhausted state remedies).</p>\n<p>Nor is the fact that the labeling of the claim changed over time sufficient to warrant rescission of the waiver; to the extent that the claim was vague or not specifically identified in <i>haec verba</i> as a competence claim, it was incumbent upon the waiving party to use caution in the exercise of the waiver. <i>Cf. </i><i>In re Cargill, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196338\"><a href=\"/opinion/196338/in-re-v-cargill-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1256</span></a></span>, 1261 (1st Cir.1995) (declining to allow retraction of waiver and noting that \"litigants ordinarily are bound by their attorneys' tactical judgments\"). Regardless of the absence of a label, the allegations pointed unerringly to the issue of competency. We conclude, therefore, that because the Commonwealth was on clear notice of the petitioner's assertion of the competence claim, its express and unqualified waiver of the nonexhaustion defense was effective as to the later iteration of that claim.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth's defense of procedural default, initially raised in this court, is too little and too late. A habeas claim is procedurally defaulted in either of two situations. First, a claim is procedurally defaulted if the state court has denied relief on that claim on independent and adequate state procedural grounds. <i>See </i><i>Lambrix v. Singletary,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118109\"><a href=\"/opinion/118109/lambrix-v-singletary/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 522-23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118109\"><a href=\"/opinion/118109/lambrix-v-singletary/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span> (1997). Second, a claim is procedurally defaulted if it was not presented to the state courts and it is clear that those courts would have held the claim procedurally barred. <i>See </i><i>Coleman v. Thompson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112640\"><a href=\"/opinion/112640/coleman-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span>, 735 n. 1, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112640\"><a href=\"/opinion/112640/coleman-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span> (1991); <i>Perruquet v. Briley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788465\"><a href=\"/opinion/788465/james-perruquet-v-kenneth-r-briley/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">505</span></a></span>, 514 (7th Cir. 2004). The habeas respondent (here, the Commonwealth) bears the burden \"not only of asserting that a default occurred, but also of persuading the court that the factual and legal prerequisites of a default . . . are present.\" 2 Hertz &amp; Liebman, <i>supra</i> § 26.2a, at 1265 n. 5.</p>\n<p>We assume that, as a matter of discretion, we may consider the Commonwealth's belated assertion of the defense of procedural default. <i>See </i><i>Brewer v. Marshall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197471\"><a href=\"/opinion/197471/brewer-v-marshall-sheriff/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></a></span>, 999 (1st Cir.1997) (noting that a federal court has discretionary authority to consider a belatedly raised procedural default defense or even to raise procedural default sua sponte). Because no state court has ruled on the petitioner's competence claim, the Commonwealth's position necessarily hinges on the second branch of the procedural default defense. It cannot satisfy that standard.</p>\n<p>In this case, exhaustion and procedural default are not completely separate matters. This imbrication is quite important; in expressly waiving the nonexhaustion defense, the Commonwealth lost the concomitant right, in the procedural default context, to assert that the claim was not presented to the state courts. <i>See </i><i>Bledsue,</i> 188 F.3d at 254 (concluding that the state had waived this form of procedural default defense when it admitted that the habeas petitioner had exhausted his state remedies).</p>\n<p>Beyond the waiver, the Commonwealth has not shown that the competence claim, if presented today in the state courts, would be procedurally barred. It offhandedly references a state procedural rule in support of its procedural default defense  but that rule cannot carry the weight that the Commonwealth places on it. The rule provides in part that grounds <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> not raised in an original motion for a new trial are waived \"unless the judge in the exercise of discretion permits them to be raised in a subsequent motion.\" Mass. R.Crim. P. 30(c)(2). Along this line, the SJC has indicated that, in \"extraordinary cases,\" a motions justice may invoke Rule 30(c)(2) to consider new issues even after an appeal has been decided. <i>Commonwealth v. Harrington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2123503\"><a href=\"/opinion/2123503/commonwealth-v-harrington/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2123503\"><a href=\"/opinion/2123503/commonwealth-v-harrington/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span>, 478 (1980).</p>\n<p>The second branch of the procedural default defense depends on a high degree of confidence that the state court, if asked to adjudicate the claim, would declare it to be procedurally defaulted. <i>See </i><i>Cassett v. Stewart,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790104\"><a href=\"/opinion/790104/gary-paul-cassett-v-terry-l-stewart-director/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span>, 622-23 (9th Cir. 2005). This is as it should be: a federal court always must be chary about reaching a conclusion, based upon a speculative analysis of what a state court might do, that a particular claim is procedurally foreclosed. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Banks v. Horn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746846\"><a href=\"/opinion/746846/george-e-banks-v-martin-horn-commissioner-pa-department-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 212-13 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>We apply those principles here. Given the divers possibilities that attend this situation, we are uncertain what procedural course the state trial court would take if asked to rule on the competence claim. That uncertainty dooms the procedural default defense. <i>Id.</i> at 213.</p>\n<p>Of course, our double-barreled conclusion that the Commonwealth waived its nonexhaustion defense and that it cannot mount a successful procedural default defense does not compel us to adjudicate the competence claim on the merits. A federal court may choose, in its sound discretion, to reject a state's waiver of either nonexhaustion or procedural default. <i>See </i><i>Granberry,</i> 481 U.S. at 134-35, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111862\"><a href=\"/opinion/111862/granberry-v-greer/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Whatever the extent of the state court's opportunity to adjudicate the competence claim  a matter as to which the parties vehemently disagree  that court did evaluate the factual basis upon which the competence claim is premised. With that in mind, it is difficult to imagine how the interests of comity will be disserved by permitting a federal court, taking cognizance of those factual findings, to resolve the competence claim on its merits.</p>\n<p>To cinch matters, the interests of judicial economy also will be served by putting the competence claim to rest here and now. The district court has held an extensive evidentiary hearing, and there is no way to unring the bell.</p>\n<p>To say more on this issue would be to paint the lily.<sup>[7]</sup> For the reasons elucidated above, we hold the Commonwealth to its express waiver of exhaustion, reject its belated attempt to interpose a defense of procedural default, and proceed to evaluate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> the merits of the petitioner's competence claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Merits.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>It is common ground that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from prosecuting those who are not competent to stand trial. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Medina v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112775\"><a href=\"/opinion/112775/medina-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span>, 439, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112775\"><a href=\"/opinion/112775/medina-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span> (1992). The test for competence is uncontroversial; the accused, before and during the trial, must have \"sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\" and must possess \"a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\" <i>Dusky,</i> 362 U.S. at 402, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106037\"><a href=\"/opinion/106037/dusky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span>; <i>see </i><i>United States v.

She does not impugn her capacity to have understood the nature and import of the proceedings against her and to have communicated with her counsel on most subjects. She claims instead that the competence standard was infringed by her inability to communicate the facts touching upon her abuse to her lawyers. The state court motions justice questioned her overall credibility. The district court took a more empathetic view, finding that severe and pervasive abuse had occurred. But that court, too, rejected the petitioner's claim, concluding that she had retained the ability to communicate the abuse to her lawyers in the months leading up to the trial.</p>\n<p>Taking the full sweep of the evidentiary record into account, <i>see supra</i> Part III, we focus on the district court's factual findings (rather than those of the state court). That focus, combined with the absence of a state court decision on the competence claim, alters the normal AEDPA standard of review and makes this case procedurally more like a direct criminal appeal. Thus, we will uphold the district court's determination of competence made after an evidentiary hearing unless that determination is clearly erroneous. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Santos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197680\"><a href=\"/opinion/197680/united-states-v-santos/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.1997). That standard is quite deferential; a finding of fact is clearly erroneous only when, upon a thorough assessment of the record, the reviewing court is left with an abiding conviction that a mistake has been made. <i>United States v.

Given the independent factfinding that took place here and the intensely fact-based nature of competency inquiries, <i>see </i><i>Drope v. Missouri,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109191\"><a href=\"/opinion/109191/drope-v-missouri/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, 180, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109191\"><a href=\"/opinion/109191/drope-v-missouri/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span> (1975), we see no reason to deviate from this deferential standard of review. <i>See supra</i> Part II.</p>\n<p>Of course, an assertion of legal error still engenders de novo review. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Wiggin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201923\"><a href=\"/opinion/201923/united-states-v-wiggin/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2005). Here, however, neither party suggests that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard in adjudicating the issue of competence. Consequently, we train the lens of our inquiry on two matters: the district court's factual findings and the question of whether those findings supported its ultimate conclusion.</p>\n<p>At the end of the federal evidentiary hearing, the district court credited large portions of the petitioner's testimony and found that she had been subject to severe and pervasive abuse prior to her pretrial incarceration. The court also found that some emotional abuse had continued during her immurement. Notwithstanding these (favorable) findings, the court concluded that the petitioner had been able, throughout the pretrial period <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> and the trial itself, to communicate the abuse to her lawyers, but had made an affirmative decision not to broach that topic. In the court's view, the petitioner, \"at the relevant times,\" was not \"incapable of choice.\" Indeed, the petitioner had a \"sufficient and then present ability to consult with her attorneys\" with a reasonable degree of rational understanding. Therefore, she was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p>The district court's ultimate conclusion is amply supported by the record. The court picked its way carefully through a tangled evidentiary thicket. It took issue with some of the state court's findings, credited much of the petitioner's testimony, and gave credence to her expert's opinion that she had experienced battered woman's syndrome. At the same time, however, the court discounted significant portions of her testimony, including her claims of abuse suffered as a child, her claim that she had attempted to raise the issue of abuse with her attorneys at one point during the state court proceedings, and her various versions of the events that transpired on the day of the murder. In the end, the court found that the petitioner had not proved that an inability to communicate existed at the critical time.</p>\n<p>The court was fully entitled to accept parts of the testimony of the petitioner and her experts yet reject the ultimate conclusion that they advocated. <i>See </i><i>Wiggin,</i> 429 F.3d at 37; <i>Santos,</i> 131 F.3d at 20-21; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Alicea,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198845\"><a href=\"/opinion/198845/united-states-v-rivera-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 483 (1st Cir.2000) (explaining that a factfinder \"has the prerogative to credit some parts of a witness's testimony and disregard other potentially contradictory portions\"). Certain features of this case reinforce that entitlement.</p>\n<p>For one thing, the story that the petitioner told at trial in the state court did not jibe with Loring's account but, rather, incriminated him. It seems logical to infer that, had the petitioner been completely under Loring's spell at that time, her testimony would have been more in tune with his. <i>Cf. </i><i>State v. Kelly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2315254\"><a href=\"/opinion/2315254/state-v-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2315254\"><a href=\"/opinion/2315254/state-v-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>, 372 (1984) (noting that victims of battered woman's syndrome have a tendency to accept responsibility for the batterer's actions).</p>\n<p>For another thing, the logistics of the relationship between Loring and the petitioner were dramatically altered from and after their arrests. Both he and she were incarcerated for nearly a year prior to trial. They were housed on separate floors, and neither of them was free to move at will about the jail. The petitioner constructed an elaborate theory of how Loring was able to exert continued dominion over her during this interval and the district court seems to have bought into that theory. Even so, Loring's control over Pike plainly was palliated by their lack of physical proximity. <i>See </i><i>McMaugh v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2062362\"><a href=\"/opinion/2062362/mcmaugh-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 728, 730 (R.I.1992) (deeming continuous contact relevant to the conclusion that battered woman's syndrome rendered defendant unable to communicate her abuse). The district court's ultimate conclusion  that the petitioner, during this period, retained the ability to make a real choice about whether to disclose the details of their relationship to her counsel  seems to us a tacit recognition that Loring's control had abated.</p>\n<p>Then, too, other straws in the wind pointed to the petitioner's competency to stand trial. For example, the district court heard testimony from one of the petitioner's trial attorneys. This seasoned criminal defense lawyer harbored no doubt about the petitioner's competence at the time of trial. He reported that the petitioner responded alertly and appropriately to questions, testified articulately, and took an active part in her own defense. This testimony was borne out by the transcript <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> of the state court trial and by other evidence of the petitioner's active participation in her defense, including evidence that the petitioner had written letters to her attorneys during her incarceration.</p>\n<p>The court also heard the testimony of Loring's defense counsel, who described the petitioner, in the relevant time frame, as \"calm\" and \"collected.\" In addition, the Commonwealth adduced evidence that, as compared to Loring, the petitioner seemed \"the stronger of the two individuals in th[e] situation that they were both in.\"</p>\n<p>Although the petitioner offered explanations to counter many of these items, the district court was in no way bound either to accept those explanations or to ignore the Commonwealth's evidence. In the final analysis, it was wholly within the factfinder's province to resolve these contradictions and to choose among the conflicting inferences that the evidence suggested. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gobbi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202578\"><a href=\"/opinion/202578/united-states-v-gobbi/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 311 (1st Cir.2006); <i>United States v.

Conaghan,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">740</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">956</span></span>, 960 (2000); <i>McMaugh,</i> 612 A.2d at 732. This is something of a red herring; these cases stand for nothing more than the now-unremarkable proposition that battered woman's syndrome can in certain circumstances render a criminal defendant incompetent. The district court recognized this proposition (as do we) but found it inapplicable in this situation. As we have said, that fact-specific determination was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p>That resolves this aspect of the matter. After hearing extensive testimony  perhaps more than it should have heard, <i>see supra</i> Part III  and carefully reviewing an amplitudinous record, the district court made a factual finding that the petitioner, at and before her trial, had the ability to consult and communicate with her counsel and to assist in her defense. That finding may be arguable, but we have no abiding conviction that it was wrong. The finding is, therefore, entitled to deference. <i>See </i><i>Ferrara,</i> 456 F.3d at 287; <i>Wiggin,</i> 429 F.3d at 37. It follows that the district court did not err in rejecting the competence claim.</p>\n<p>V. THE INVOLUNTARY WAIVER CLAIM</p>\n<p>We next address the petitioner's claim that the effects of the abuse, when combined with Loring's continued coercive control over her, forced her to forgo asserting battered woman's syndrome as a defense and, thus, violated her constitutional rights. The petitioner constructs this portion of her argument in two layers.</p>\n<p>The foundation is a line of Supreme Court cases that speak to an accused's constitutional right to present a defense. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rock v.

But these cases are not directly applicable; the petitioner's right to present the battered woman's syndrome defense, if infringed at all, was infringed by Loring, not by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p>In an effort to overcome this obstacle, the petitioner adds the next forensic layer. That layer builds on cases which, in her view, indicate that, even in the absence of state action, the right to present a defense <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> may be abridged either by the conduct of a private party, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Nichols v.

This may explain why the court did not specifically rule on this claim in its <i>ore sponte</i> denial of the habeas petition. We need not belabor the point. The <i>availability</i> of the claim as a ground for habeas relief is a question of law  and one that the state courts did not directly address. Accordingly, our review is de novo. <i>See </i><i>Fortini,</i> 257 F.3d at 47.</p>\n<p>At first blush, this \"involuntary waiver\" claim may seem like nothing more than a recasting of the competence claim. But competence and voluntariness are separate (though complementary) inquiries. \"The focus of a competency inquiry is the defendant's mental capacity\" whereas the focus of a voluntariness inquiry is on \"whether the defendant actually <i>does</i> understand the significance and consequences of a particular decision and whether the decision is uncoerced.\" <i>Godinez v.

Unless the accused's right to present a defense is infringed <i>by state action,</i> the infringement is not redressable by a federal court charged with vindicating federal constitutional rights.

Guarino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200004\"><a href=\"/opinion/200004/ouber-v-guarino/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 35-36 (1st Cir.2002). The petitioner in this case makes no comparable claim.</p>\n<p>The petitioner's contention that a physical or mental condition, not attributable to state action, may work a violation of an accused's constitutional right to present a defense is wishful thinking. The single case that she cites in support of that proposition is far off the point. In that case, the defendant argued that the denial of his motion for either a severance or a continuance following a heart attack deprived him of his constitutional right to testify. <i>See </i><i>Ferrarini,</i> 219 F.3d at 151. As such, the constitutional claim was focused not on the defendant's physical condition but, rather, on the district court's decision to forge ahead with the trial despite knowledge of the defendant's infirmity  a decision that plainly constituted state action. <i>See </i><i>Shelley v. Kraemer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104545\"><a href=\"/opinion/104545/shelley-v-kraemer/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104545\"><a href=\"/opinion/104545/shelley-v-kraemer/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104545\"><a href=\"/opinion/104545/shelley-v-kraemer/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span> (1948) (deeming \"long [ ] established\" the proposition that the actions of state courts and judicial officers in their official capacities constitute state action).</p>\n<p>The short of the matter is that the petitioner invites us to find a constitutional violation (separate and distinct from ineffective assistance of counsel) in the infringement of an accused's right to present a defense by a private party alone, without any awareness (actual or imputed) of that infringement by a state actor. We decline her invitation.<sup>[10]</sup> We emphasize that, in doing so, we do not hold that an infringement of this right by a private party may never result in a constitutional violation; this case does not require us to sweep so broadly. We do hold that the petitioner's involuntary waiver claim, as formulated here, is not cognizable as a separate and distinct ground for federal habeas relief.</p>\n<p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p>We summarize succinctly. Because the Commonwealth waived its defense of nonexhaustion and failed to establish a defense of procedural default, we have considered the merits of the petitioner's claim <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> that she was incompetent to stand trial in the state court. We find the district court's fact-bound rejection of that claim to be supportable.</p>\n<p>The petitioner's remaining initiative  her claim of involuntary waiver  lacks legal footing and, thus, does not open a separate avenue for federal habeas relief. We need go no further.</p>\n<p><i>We reject both the petitioner's appeal (No. 06-1019) and the Commonwealth's cross-appeal (No. 06-1020). The judgment of the district court is affirmed. No costs.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Battered woman's syndrome has been described as a \"series of common characteristics that appear in women who are abused physically and psychologically over an extended period of time by the dominant male figure in their lives.\" <i>State v. Kelly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2315254\"><a href=\"/opinion/2315254/state-v-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2315254\"><a href=\"/opinion/2315254/state-v-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>, 371 (1984). One of these characteristics is a type of learned helplessness, through which the woman believes that the batterer has complete control of the relationship and that she cannot escape. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1667149\"><a href=\"/opinion/1667149/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1501</span></a></span>, 1505 (D.Kan.1995). Women suffering from the syndrome often have a difficult time disclosing the abuse; \"it is the nature of [the] illness to conceal its existence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1510.</p>\n<p>[2]  During its four-year odyssey in the district court, the petitioner's case was assigned at different times to different judges. Rather than matching each ruling with each judge, we take an institutional view and refer only to the decisions of the district court.</p>\n<p>[3]  Some courts have indicated that an \"independent review\" standard should guide the evaluation of mixed questions of fact and law in habeas cases. <i>See </i><i>Scarpa,</i> 38 F.3d at 9 n. 5 (collecting cases); <i>see also</i> 2 Childress &amp; Davis, <i>supra</i> § 13.06, at 13-50. We do not linger over this question because independent review involves roughly the same tamisage that we have outlined here; that is, significant deference to factbound determinations and little or no deference to law-based determinations. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Tortora,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553834\"><a href=\"/opinion/553834/united-states-v-carmen-a-tortora/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">880</span></a></span>, 882-83 (1st Cir.1990); <i>see also </i><i>Scarpa,</i> 38 F.3d at 9 n. 5 (bypassing inquiry for similar reasons).</p>\n<p>[4]  In the court below, the petitioner argued that the state court's factual findings were not entitled to a presumption of correctness because they were unreasonable in light of the evidence presented. She based this argument on the notion that AEDPA sections 2254(d)(2) and (e)(1) operate in tandem. To support that notion, she cited our opinion in <i>Mastracchio v. Vose,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199747\"><a href=\"/opinion/199747/mastracchio-v-vose/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span>, 597-98 (1st Cir.2001). The district court did not accept this hypothesis but, before us, the petitioner does not allege any harm resulting from the district court's refusal. Consequently, it is unnecessary for us to test this hypothesis.</p>\n<p>[5]  The lawyers did testify during the state court hearing, but at the Commonwealth's instance.</p>\n<p>[6]  For example, such hearings are often useful when the federal habeas court is asked to consider a claim based on ineffective assistance of state court counsel. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Bryan,</i> 335 F.3d at 1215.</p>\n<p>[7]  It is worth noting that, in the end, we find the competence claim wanting. <i>See infra</i> Part IV(B). When a federal court grants habeas relief on an unexhausted claim, comity concerns are greater than when it denies relief on such a claim. <i>See </i><i>Jones v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"16317\"><a href=\"/opinion/16317/jones-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span>, 299 (5th Cir.1998); <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(2) (authorizing a federal court to deny unexhausted habeas claims on the merits).</p>\n<p>[8]  The petitioner seems uncertain whether the right that she asserts is rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or in the Sixth Amendment as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>See</i> Petitioner's Br. at 49. Because we find no violation of any cognizable constitutional right, we need not untangle this knot.</p>\n<p>[9]  Although the petitioner cites an occasional case indicating that trial courts have an affirmative duty to prevent the involuntary waiver of certain rights, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Johnson v. Zerbst,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103050\"><a href=\"/opinion/103050/johnson-v-zerbst/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span>, 464-65, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1019</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1461</span></span> (1938) (discussing waivers of right to counsel), she has not argued that the state trial court should have conducted some particularized inquiry in <i>her</i> case; nor does she identify what would have put the court on notice of the need to conduct such an inquiry. Where, as here, an appellant has merely hinted obliquely at an argument but has not advanced it distinctly, that argument is not in the case. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones.\").</p>\n<p>[10]  It bears mentioning that, even if we were to recognize this new type of constitutional violation, we would likely be barred from granting habeas relief on this claim under the familiar doctrine of <i>Teague v. Lane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112206\"><a href=\"/opinion/112206/teague-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 310, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112206\"><a href=\"/opinion/112206/teague-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112206\"><a href=\"/opinion/112206/teague-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></a></span> (1989) (plurality opinion). For two reasons  because Pike has made a colorable claim that the Commonwealth waived the <i>Teague</i> issue below and because the merits of this claim are relatively clear-cut  we have elected to bypass an in-depth <i>Teague</i> analysis. <i>See </i><i>Campiti v. Matesanz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200525\"><a href=\"/opinion/200525/campiti-v-matesanz/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span>, 321-22 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n\n</div>",
