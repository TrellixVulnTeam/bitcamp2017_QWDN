William E. Smith,         U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Jacqueline Dash on brief pro se.\n     Robert Clarke Corrente, United States Attorney, Lisa\nDinerman and Dulce Donovan, Assistant United States Attorneys,\non Opposition to Motion for Stay of Removal.\n\n\n\n\n                          September 21, 2004\n\f             Per    Curiam.   Petitioner     Jacqueline       Dash,   a    lawful\n\npermanent resident, has filed a motion for stay of deportation\n\npending appeal of the dismissal of her habeas petition, filed under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2241.      The district court dismissed the petition on the\n\nground, among others, that it was an abuse of the writ.                           We\n\nconclude that, even assuming petitioner had not abused the writ,\n\nshe still would lose on the merits of her claims.\n\n             Petitioner's first contention concerns her eligibility\n\nfor a waiver of deportation under § 212(h) of the Immigration and\n\nNationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), on the basis of extreme\n\nhardship.      Petitioner is ineligible for such relief, however,\n\nbecause she has been convicted of an aggravated felony.                   Pursuant\n\nto the amendments made by the Illegal Immigration Reform and\n\nImmigrant    Responsibility     Act    (IIRIRA),   see    §   348(a),      such    a\n\nconviction bars an alien from applying for a section 212(h) waiver.\n\n             Further, and contrary to petitioner's arguments, the\n\nIIRIRA amendment to section 212(h) applies retroactively.                  IIRIRA\n\n§   348(b)   specifically     states    that   \"[t]he    amendment        made    by\n\nsubsection (a) shall be effective on the date of the enactment of\n\nthis Act and shall apply in the case of any alien who is in\n\nexclusion or deportation proceedings as of such date unless a final\n\nadministrative order in such proceedings has been entered as of\n\nsuch date.\"        This is the kind of language that shows \"Congress'\n\nwillingness . . . to indicate unambiguously its intention to apply\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fspecific provisions retroactively.\"          INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289,\n\n318-19 & n.43 (2001) (citing § 348(b), in dictum, as an example of\n\nsuch language).        \"Where the congressional intent is clear, it\n\ngoverns.\"     Kaiser Alum. & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827,\n\n837 (1990).\n\n            Petitioner's second argument -- that the immigration\n\njudge (IJ) incorrectly concluded that petitioner was not entitled\n\nto apply for a waiver under INA § 212(c), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) --\n\nalso fails.     Specifically, the IJ concluded that petitioner was\n\nineligible for a section 212(c) waiver because she (petitioner) had\n\nserved five or more years for an aggravated felony.                     Although\n\npetitioner claims that the IJ erred both in his calculation of the\n\nfive-year period and in considering the wrong aggravated felonies,\n\nshe has waived these issues by defaulting her appeal to the Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals from the IJ's order. The failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies precludes consideration of these issues in\n\nthe current habeas petition.           See Kurfees v. INS, 275 F.3d 332,\n\n335-36 (4th Cir. 2001) (holding that an alien cannot bypass the\n\nexhaustion requirement by filing a habeas petition); see also\n\nSayyah v. Farquharson, No. 03-1802, slip op. at 6-12 (1st Cir. Aug.\n\n30, 2004).\n\n            Petitioner's    final      argument   is   that   her   continuing\n\ndetention    pending    removal   is    unauthorized    by    statute    and   is\n\nunconstitutional.      We do not think so and therefore agree with the\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fgovernment that petitioner's detention, at least up until the\n\npresent time, is authorized by 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(C).         This\n\ncase,   therefore,   is   distinguishable   from   the   circumstances\n\ndescribed in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001).       See Lema v.\n\nINS, 341 F.3d 853 (9th Cir. 2003).\n\n          The judgment of the district court is summarily affirmed,\n\nsee 1st Cir. R. 27(c), and the motion for a stay is denied as moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f",
