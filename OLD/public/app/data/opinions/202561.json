Patti B.

Fox for appellant Bruce Ziskind.\n     Robert L. Sheketoff for appellant Bruce Turner.\n     John A. Capin, Assistant United States Attorney, and Michael\nJ. Sullivan, United States Attorney, for appellee.\n\n\n                        December 22, 2006\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.      Bruce Ziskind and Bruce Turner\n\npled guilty in federal district court to theft from an interstate\n\nshipment and conspiracy to steal from an interstate shipment.      The\n\ndistrict   court   sentenced   Ziskind     to    twenty-four   months'\n\nimprisonment and twelve months of supervised release.       Turner was\n\nsentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment and thirty-six months of\n\nsupervised release.   Both were required to pay restitution.\n\n           Ziskind and Turner appeal their sentences.      They argue\n\nthat because no loss amount was charged in the indictment, United\n\nStates v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), barred the district court\n\nfrom ordering restitution in any amount.        Ziskind further argues\n\nthat the government lacks standing to enforce the restitution order\n\nbecause the victim waived restitution. Finally, Turner argues that\n\nthe district court sentenced him to terms of imprisonment and\n\nsupervised release above the statutory maxima.\n\n           As the government concedes, the district court erred in\n\nimposing a thirty-six-month term of supervised release on Turner,\n\nand we thus vacate this term of supervised release and remand to\n\nthe district court to impose a term of supervised release of no\n\nmore than one year.   Otherwise, we reject the arguments made by\n\nZiskind and Turner and affirm their sentences.\n\n                                I.\n\n           On December 29, 2002, Ziskind and Turner, along with\n\nothers, participated in the theft of a shipment of Gillette Company\n\n                                -2-\n\fmerchandise consisting primarily of Mach3® razors.           A portion of\n\nthe stolen shipment was recovered.         On March 26, 2003, a grand jury\n\nin the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment charging\n\nZiskind and Turner with theft from an interstate shipment in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 659 (Count One), and conspiracy to\n\nsteal from an interstate shipment in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371\n\n(Count Three).1   The indictment did not allege a loss amount.\n\n            Ziskind and Turner pled guilty to both charges on March\n\n23, 2004.   At an evidentiary hearing on July 30, 2004, the district\n\ncourt found the value of the stolen shipment to be $254,000.\n\n            The same day, the court sentenced Ziskind to twenty-four\n\nmonths' imprisonment, twelve months of supervised release, and to\n\npay $145,142 in restitution.         Twelve months of Ziskind's term of\n\nimprisonment was to run concurrently with an undischarged term of\n\nimprisonment he was then serving.          On November 1, 2004, the court\n\nsentenced   Turner   to   eighteen    months'   imprisonment,   thirty-six\n\nmonths of supervised release,2 and, jointly and severally with\n\n\n     1\n          The indictment also charged Ziskind and Turner with\npossession of goods stolen from an interstate shipment in violation\nof 18 U.S.C. § 659 (Count Two). That count was dismissed as a\nlesser included offense to Count One.\n          In addition, the indictment charged Russell Jones with\nCounts One through Three and Brendan Bottino with Count Two. Both\npled guilty. Jones was sentenced to twelve months' probation and\nordered to pay $5000 in restitution, and Bottino was sentenced to\ntwelve months' imprisonment. Neither has appealed his sentence.\n     2\n          At the sentencing hearing, the court ordered Turner to\nserve a five-year term of supervised release. The court did not at\n\n                                     -3-\n\fZiskind,   to   pay   $145,142   in   restitution.   Turner's   term   of\n\nimprisonment was to run concurrently with a 235-month sentence that\n\nhe received the same day on an unrelated felon-in-possession\n\ncharge.\n\n                                      II.\n\n           We review sentencing issues involving questions of law de\n\nnovo.   United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 535 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nNormally, \"decisions to impose concurrent or consecutive sentences\n\nare committed to the judgment of the sentencing court, and such\n\ndecisions are reviewed only for an abuse of discretion.\"         Id. at\n\n536.    However, unpreserved claims are reviewed for plain error.\n\nDiaz-Fonseca v. Puerto Rico, 451 F.3d 13, 35-36 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nTo prevail on a claim reviewed for plain error, a defendant must\n\ndemonstrate that:\n\n           \"(1) an error was committed; (2) the error was\n           'plain' (i.e.[,] obvious and clear under\n           current law); (3) the error was prejudicial\n           (i.e.[,] affected substantial rights); and (4)\n           review is needed to prevent a miscarriage of\n           justice,\" meaning that \"the error 'seriously\n           impaired the fairness, integrity, or public\n           reputation of judicial proceedings.'\"\n\nId. at 36 (alterations in original) (quoting Rivera Castillo v.\n\nAutokirey, Inc., 379 F.3d 4, 10 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Smith v.\n\n\nthat time specify whether the five-year sentence was attributable\nto an unrelated felon-in-possession charge, on which Turner was\nalso sentenced that day, the theft charges, or both. However, the\njudgment in this case specifies a thirty-six-month period of\nsupervised release, and the judgment in the firearms case indicates\na sixty-month term of supervised release.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fKmart Corp., 177 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir. 1999))); see also United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993).\n\nA.          Restitution\n\n            Ziskind and Turner argue that the Mandatory Victims\n\nRestitution Act (MVRA), 18 U.S.C. §§ 3663A, 3664, which mandates\n\nimposition        of     restitution      orders      in   their      cases,      is\n\nunconstitutional as applied to them because no loss amount was\n\ncharged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.      They argue that Booker prohibits the post-conviction\n\njudicial factfinding underlying their restitution orders.3\n\n            We bypass the question of whether Ziskind and Turner\n\npreserved    their      Booker    arguments     and   assume   for   the   sake   of\n\nargument that they did.4\n\n            The        argument    that     Booker      applies      to    judicial\n\ndetermination of the amount of restitution is without merit.\n\n\"Booker and its antecedents do not bar judges from finding the\n\n\n     3\n          Ziskind also relies on Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S.\n296, 303 (2004), and Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 602 (2002).\n     4\n          Ziskind and Turner argue that they preserved the Booker\nargument because both objected under Blakely to the court's\ndetermining the loss amount on which the restitution orders were\nbased. See United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st\nCir. 2005) (\"The argument that a Booker error occurred is preserved\nif the defendant below argued Apprendi or Blakely error . . . .\").\nZiskind's position has additional complications: because his plea\nagreement provided that the U.S. Attorney would recommend to the\nsentencing judge a sentence that included \"restitution in an amount\nto be determined at sentencing,\" the district court believed that\nany Blakely objection was waived. Ziskind argued to the district\ncourt that the objection was not waived.\n\n                                          -5-\n\ffacts   necessary    to    impose    a     restitution    order.    .   .   .    Post-\n\nconviction judicial fact-finding to determine [loss] amount 'by no\n\nmeans impos[es] a punishment beyond that authorized by jury-found\n\nor admitted facts' or 'beyond the \"statutory maximum\"' . . . .\"\n\nUnited States v. Milkiewicz, --- F.3d ---, No. 06-1192, slip op. at\n\n30-31 (1st Cir. Dec. 6, 2006) (second alteration in original)\n\n(quoting United States v. Leahy, 438 F.3d 328, 336-37 (3d Cir.\n\n2006) (en banc)).\n\n           Judicial determination of the loss amount underlying the\n\nrestitution orders was constitutionally permissible.\n\nB.         Government Standing To Enforce Ziskind's Restitution\n           Order\n\n           Ziskind    argues        that    Gillette,     the   victim,         waived\n\nrestitution and did not assign its interest in any restitution to\n\nthe Crime Victims Fund of the United States Treasury, and that the\n\ngovernment therefore has no legally cognizable interest in the\n\nrestitution award.        He argues that the government's standing with\n\nrespect    to   restitution     was        conferred     by   the   MVRA        \"as   a\n\nconvenience,\" so that the government could \"litigate on behalf of\n\nthe victims in lieu of their own participation.\"                As a result, he\n\nargues, the government does not have standing to litigate or\n\nenforce the July 30, 2004 restitution order, and the order must be\n\nvacated.    Ziskind did not make these arguments to the district\n\ncourt, so we review only for plain error.\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f          There was no error here, much less plain error.     First,\n\nthe record does not establish that the victim, Gillette, in fact\n\nwaived restitution. Gillette stated in the course of its motion to\n\nquash a subpoena seeking a valuation of the stolen merchandise that\n\nit was willing to give up any claim of restitution in an effort to\n\navoid involvement in the case.   That device did not work.   Gillette\n\nbecame involved, and thereafter, Gillette agreed to the ordering of\n\nrestitution.\n\n          More importantly, the prosecution's standing to seek\n\nrestitution under the MVRA does not depend on a victim's actions.\n\nThis is because, contrary to Ziskind's assertion, restitution\n\nordered as part of a criminal sentence is a criminal penalty, not\n\na civil remedy.5   United States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 619 (1st\n\nCir. 1993); see also Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U.S. 36, 52 (1986)\n\n(\"Although restitution does resemble a judgment 'for the benefit\n\nof' the victim, the context in which it is imposed undermines that\n\nconclusion.    The victim has no control over . . . the decision to\n\naward restitution.\"); United States v. Rostoff, 164 F.3d 63, 71\n\n(1st Cir. 1999) (\"The nature of restitution is penal and not\n\n\n     5\n          Nor do we necessarily accept Ziskind's assumption that\ngovernment standing in a civil case, see, e.g., 15 U.S.C. § 78u(5),\nderives from the victim's standing.     See U.S. Dep't of Hous. &\nUrban Dev. v. Cost Control Mktg. & Sales Mgmt. of Va., Inc., 64\nF.3d 925, 928 (4th Cir. 1995) (suggesting that in a civil action,\nthe government can have a penal interest in enforcing the repayment\nof a debt to a third party).\n\n                                 -7-\n\fcompensatory.\").      In Savoie, we held that restitution imposed as\n\npart of a criminal sentence \"is not a civil affair; it is a\n\ncriminal    penalty    meant    to    have     deterrent    and    rehabilitative\n\neffects.     Private      parties     cannot    simply     agree   to   waive   the\n\napplication of a criminal statute.\"               985 F.2d at 619 (citation\n\nomitted); cf. United States v. Parsons, 141 F.3d 386, 393 (1st Cir.\n\n1998)   (\"[A]   release    by   the    victim    does    not   preclude    or   cap\n\nrestitution of losses as part of criminal sentencing in a case\n\nwhere there is no double recovery.\").\n\n            To the extent Ziskind argues that the MVRA itself does\n\nnot authorize restitution in this case, that argument fails.\n\n            United States v. Reifler, 446 F.3d 65 (2d Cir. 2006), on\n\nwhich Ziskind relies, is inapposite.             The court in Reifler vacated\n\norders that awarded restitution to people who did not qualify as\n\nvictims under the MVRA.         Id. at 125-27, 132; cf. United States v.\n\nParadis, 219 F.3d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 2000) (vacating order awarding\n\nrestitution to bankruptcy trustee, who was not a victim of the\n\noffense).    There is no question in this case that Gillette was\n\ninjured by the defendants' conduct and is a victim within the\n\nmeaning of the MVRA.\n\n            Nor is United States v. Pawlinski, 374 F.3d 536 (7th Cir.\n\n2004), on which Ziskind also relies, applicable. In Pawlinski, the\n\ncourt held that unclaimed restitution could not be transferred to\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fthe Crime Victims Fund because the Crime Victims Fund was not a\n\nvictim or victim representative.             Id. at 539-40.         This case raises\n\nno such issue because Gillette accepted the district court's\n\ndecision to impose restitution, and the order of restitution states\n\nthat it will be paid to Gillette.\n\n           The restitution order was proper.\n\nC.         Turner's Term of Imprisonment\n\n           Turner argues that the district court erred in sentencing\n\nhim to a total of eighteen months' imprisonment through consecutive\n\nsentences.      Eighteen months, he argues, is above the authorized\n\nstatutory maximum.        He argues, and the government concedes, that\n\nbecause   the    government     did    not    allege    a    loss    amount      in   the\n\nindictment, it charged only misdemeanors.                    See United States v.\n\nScanzello, 832 F.2d 18, 22-23 (3d Cir. 1987).                       Under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 371, if the object of the conspiracy is a misdemeanor, \"the\n\npunishment      for    such   conspiracy     shall     not    exceed    the   maximum\n\npunishment for such misdemeanor.\"             Thus, because the maximum term\n\nof imprisonment under Count One was one year, the maximum term\n\nunder Count Three also was one year.                   Turner argues that the\n\nimposition      of    consecutive     sentences   on     Counts      One   and    Three\n\nimpermissibly increased the term of imprisonment on Count Three\n\nbeyond one year.6        We disagree.\n\n\n     6\n          The court did not explicitly state how much of the\nsentence was attributable to the theft conviction and how much to\n\n                                        -9-\n\f           As an initial matter, Turner may well be barred from\n\nraising such a claim because his counsel urged the district court\n\nto impose a twenty-four-month sentence.           Cf. United States v.\n\nAngiulo, 897 F.2d 1169, 1216 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[W]e do not think\n\nthat defendants can properly challenge on appeal a proposal they\n\nthemselves offered to the trial court.\").\n\n           Even giving Turner the benefit of review, however, there\n\nwas neither error nor plain error. \"By statute, Congress empowered\n\ndistrict   courts   to   utilize    either   concurrent   or   consecutive\n\nsentences.\"    United States v. Quinones, 26 F.3d 213, 216 (1st Cir.\n\n1994); see also 18 U.S.C. § 3584(a) (providing that \"[i]f multiple\n\nterms of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at the same time\n\n. . . the terms may run concurrently or consecutively\").                  In\n\ndetermining whether to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences,\n\ncourts are required to consider specific factors enumerated in 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a).   18 U.S.C. § 3584(b).      These factors include \"the\n\nnature   and   circumstances   of    the   offense[,]   the    history   and\n\ncharacteristics of the defendant[,] the need for [a consecutive]\n\nsentence[,] . . . [and] the kinds of sentences available.\"               Id.\n\n§ 3553(a).     In imposing Turner's sentence the court commented on\n\nTurner's \"terrible criminal record\" and considered the range set\n\n\n\n\nthe conspiracy conviction, but it did note that each carried a\nmaximum penalty of one year.\n\n                                    -10-\n\fforth   in    the    Sentencing    Guidelines.          It   complied     with   the\n\nsentencing protocol.\n\n              Further, Turner was not prejudiced: his eighteen-month\n\nsentence runs concurrently with a 235-month sentence.                    See United\n\nStates v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. 74, 81-82 (2004) (\"[R]elief\n\nfor error is tied in some way to prejudicial effect . . . [and\n\nrequires a] showing of 'a reasonable probability that, but for [the\n\nerror claimed], the result of the proceeding would have been\n\ndifferent.'\" (third alteration in original) (quoting United States\n\nv. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985) (opinion of Blackmun, J.))).\n\nD.            Turner's Term of Supervised Release\n\n              Turner also argues that the district court erred in\n\nsentencing him to thirty-six months of supervised release.                        He\n\nargues that because the maximum term of supervised release for\n\nCount One was one year, the maximum term under Count Three also was\n\none   year,    and   that   his   term    of    supervised     release    thus   was\n\nunauthorized.\n\n              The    government   concedes       that    the    thirty-six-month\n\nsupervised release term was error.              18 U.S.C. § 3583(b) provides\n\nthat the maximum period of supervised release for a misdemeanor is\n\none year.      This maximum applies to both the substantive crime and\n\nthe conspiracy.        18 U.S.C. § 371.         Under 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e), a\n\nterm of supervised release \"runs concurrently with any [other] term\n\n. . . [of] supervised release . . . for another offense to which\n\n                                         -11-\n\fthe person is subject or becomes subject during the term of\n\nsupervised release.\"   See also United States v. Hernandez-Guevara,\n\n162 F.3d 863, 877 (5th Cir. 1998) (\"Even when federal law requires\n\nconsecutive terms of imprisonment, the supervised release term 'is\n\nto run concurrently with any other term of supervised release\n\nimposed.'\"   (quoting U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 5G1.2\n\ncommentary (1997))).\n\n          We thus vacate Turner's term of supervised release and\n\nremand for the imposition of a new term of supervised release not\n\nto exceed one year.     Otherwise, the judgments entered by the\n\ndistrict court are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f",

He argues that the government's standing with respect to restitution was conferred by the MVRA \"as a convenience,\" so that the government could \"litigate on behalf of the victims in lieu of their own participation.\" As a result, he argues, the government does not have standing to litigate or enforce the July 30, 2004 restitution order, and the order must be vacated. Ziskind did not make these arguments to the district court, so we review only for plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no error here, much less plain error. First, the record does not establish that the victim, Gillette, in fact waived restitution. Gillette stated in the course of its motion to quash a subpoena seeking a valuation of the stolen merchandise that it was willing to give up any claim of restitution in an effort to avoid involvement in the case. That device did not work. Gillette became involved, and thereafter, Gillette agreed to the ordering of restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, the prosecution's standing to seek restitution under the MVRA does not depend on a victim's actions. This is because, contrary to Ziskind's assertion, restitution ordered as part of a criminal sentence is a criminal penalty, not a civil remedy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>United States v. Savoie,</i> 985 F.2d 612, 619 (1st Cir.1993); <i>see also Kelly v. Robinson,</i> 479 U.S. 36, 52, 107 S.Ct. 353, 93 L.Ed.2d 216 (1986) (\"Although restitution does resemble a judgment `for the benefit of' the victim, the context in which it is imposed undermines that conclusion. The victim has no control over ... the decision to award restitution.\"); <i>United States v. Rostoff,</i> 164 F.3d 63, 71 (1st Cir.1999) (\"The nature of restitution is penal and not compensatory.\"). In <i>Savoie,</i> we held that restitution imposed as part of a criminal sentence \"is not a civil affair; it is a criminal penalty meant to have deterrent and rehabilitative effects. Private parties cannot simply agree to waive the application of a criminal statute.\" 985 F.2d at 619 (citation omitted); <i>cf. United States v. Parsons,</i> 141 F.3d 386, 393 (1st Cir.1998) (\"[A] release by the victim does not preclude or cap restitution of losses as part of criminal sentencing in a case where there is no double recovery.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent Ziskind argues that the MVRA itself does not authorize restitution in this case, that argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Reifler,</i> 446 F.3d 65 (2d Cir.2006), on which Ziskind relies, is inapposite. The court in <i>Reifler</i> vacated orders that awarded restitution to people who did not qualify as victims under the MVRA. <i>Id.</i> at 125-27, 132; <i>cf. United States v. Paradis,</i> 219 F.3d 22, 25 (1st Cir.2000) (vacating order awarding restitution to bankruptcy trustee, who was not a victim of the offense).

Pawlinski,</i> 374 F.3d 536 (7th Cir.2004), on which Ziskind also relies, applicable. In <i>Pawlinski,</i> the court held that unclaimed restitution could not be transferred to the Crime Victims Fund because the Crime Victims Fund was not a victim or victim representative. <i>Id.</i> at 539-40. This case raises no such issue because Gillette accepted the district court's decision to impose restitution, and the order of restitution states that it will be paid to Gillette.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The restitution order was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Turner's Term of Imprisonment</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turner argues that the district court erred in sentencing him to a total of eighteen months' imprisonment through consecutive sentences. Eighteen months, he argues, is above the authorized statutory maximum. He argues, and the government concedes, that because the government did not allege a loss amount in the indictment, it charged only misdemeanors. <i>See United States v. Scanzello,</i> 832 F.2d 18, 22-23 (3d Cir.1987). Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, if the object of the conspiracy is a misdemeanor, \"the punishment for such conspiracy shall not exceed the maximum punishment for such misdemeanor.\" Thus, because the maximum term of imprisonment under Count One was one year, the maximum term under Count Three also was one year. Turner argues that the imposition of consecutive sentences on Counts One and Three impermissibly increased the term of imprisonment on Count Three beyond one year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, Turner may well be barred from raising such a claim because his counsel urged the district court to impose a twenty-four-month sentence. <i>Cf. United States v. Angiulo,</i> 897 F.2d 1169, 1216 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[W]e do not think that defendants can properly challenge on appeal a proposal they themselves offered to the trial court.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even giving Turner the benefit of review, however, there was neither error nor plain error. \"By statute, Congress empowered district courts to utilize either concurrent or consecutive sentences.\" <i>United States v. Quinones,</i> 26 F.3d 213, 216 (1st Cir.1994); <i>see also</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3584(a) (providing that \"[i]f multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at the same time . . . the terms may run concurrently or consecutively\"). In determining whether to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences, courts are required to consider specific factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a). 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3584(b). These factors include \"the nature and circumstances of the offense[,] the history and characteristics of the defendant[,] the need for [a consecutive] sentence[,] . . . [and] the kinds of sentences available.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3553(a). In imposing Turner's sentence the court commented on Turner's \"terrible criminal record\" and considered the range set forth in the Sentencing Guidelines. It complied with the sentencing protocol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Turner was not prejudiced: his eighteen-month sentence runs concurrently with a 235-month sentence. <i>See United States v. Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. 74, 81-82, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004) (\"[R]elief for error is tied in some way to prejudicial effect . . . [and requires a] showing of `a reasonable probability that, but for [the error claimed], the result of the proceeding would have been different.'\" (third alteration in original) (quoting <i>United States v. Bagley,</i> 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985) (opinion of Blackmun, J.))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Turner's Term of Supervised Release</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turner also argues that the district court erred in sentencing him to thirty-six months of supervised release. He argues that because the maximum term of supervised release for Count One was one year, the maximum term under Count Three also was one year, and that his term of supervised release thus was unauthorized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government concedes that the thirty-six-month supervised release term was error. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(b) provides that the maximum period of supervised release for a misdemeanor is one year. This maximum applies to both the substantive crime and the conspiracy. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371. Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3624(e), a term of supervised release \"runs concurrently with any [other] term . . . [of] supervised release . . . for another offense to which the person is subject or becomes subject during the term of supervised release.\" <i>See also United States v.

He argues that the government's standing with respect to restitution was conferred by the MVRA \"as a convenience,\" so that the government could \"litigate on behalf of the victims in lieu of their own participation.\" As a result, he argues, the government does not have standing to litigate or enforce the July 30, 2004 restitution order, and the order must be vacated. Ziskind did not make these arguments to the district court, so we review only for plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no error here, much less plain error. First, the record does not establish that the victim, Gillette, in fact waived restitution. Gillette stated in the course of its motion to quash a subpoena seeking a valuation of the stolen merchandise that it was willing to give up any claim of restitution in an effort to avoid involvement in the case. That device did not work. Gillette became involved, and thereafter, Gillette agreed to the ordering of restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, the prosecution's standing to seek restitution under the MVRA does not depend on a victim's actions.

Eighteen months, he argues, is above the authorized statutory maximum. He argues, and the government concedes, that because the government did not allege a loss amount in the indictment, it charged only misdemeanors. <i>See United States v. Scanzello,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496642\"><a href=\"/opinion/496642/united-states-v-sylvester-scanzello/\"><span class=\"volume\">832</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 22-23 (3d Cir.1987). Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, if the object of the conspiracy is a misdemeanor, \"the punishment for such conspiracy shall not exceed the maximum punishment for such misdemeanor.\" Thus, because the maximum term of imprisonment under Count One was one year, the maximum term under Count Three also was one year. Turner argues that the imposition of consecutive sentences on Counts One and Three impermissibly increased the term of imprisonment on Count Three beyond one year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, Turner may well be barred from raising such a claim because his counsel urged the district court to impose a twenty-four-month sentence. <i>Cf.
