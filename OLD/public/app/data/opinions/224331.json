One of the indictment's twenty-seven counts charges a conspiracy, and the remaining counts can be divided into two groups. Half of them, with differences only as to dates, recite that \"various invoices, confirmations and bills of lading were deposited, sent and caused to be sent by said defendants by the United States mail from the Robert M.

Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 1949, 337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225. The statute does not permit appeals \"even from fully consummated decisions, where they are but steps towards final judgment in which they will merge. The purpose is to combine in one review all stages of the proceeding that effectively may be reviewed and corrected if and when final judgment results.\" Ibid. The order appealed from here will still be open to correction if and when judgment is reached on the principal issue of appellant's guilt. And by that time there is always the possibility that the prosecution will have failed, so that it may not be necessary for us to pass upon the order at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our views on the finality of a transfer order are strengthened by the statement of the Supreme Court in United States v.

[The second sentence comes from a footnote on the same page.] Moreover, it has been decided that an appeal may not be taken from a transfer order in a civil case. Jiffy Lubricator Co. v. Stewart-Warner Corp., 4 Cir., 1949, 177 F.2d 360. We can see no ground for treating Rule 21(b) differently in this respect from the corresponding civil transfer provisions of 28 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1404.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What has been said disposes of the appeals. But since this case should be tried or otherwise disposed of and since those concerned are in evident confusion as to the appropriate forum, the practical need for clarification overcomes the reluctance to issue what may be termed obiter dictum. We proceed therefore to state the legal problem and its answer as it appears to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Judge in Maine was confronted by the decision of the District Court of Hawaii in United States v. Hughes Tool Co., D.C. Hawaii 1948, 78 F. Supp. 409. The court in that case held that indictments must be tried in the district having jurisdiction of all of its counts and that if only some were transferable under Rule 21(b), the transfer could not be made. Although that case did not involve prosecution for using the mails to defraud, the Maine court in this case thought it was applicable to the indictment before it. The reason why that conclusion was reached and why we think it is incorrect will be stated presently. We want it to be clear that we are neither approving nor disapproving the Hughes Tool Co. case because in our view it does not bear upon the problem presented here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This indictment, it will be remembered, contains thirteen counts charging the mailing of letters from Boston, Massachusetts, to Sanford, Maine. It also contains thirteen counts for mailing letters from Sanford, Maine, to Boston, Massachusetts. The conspiracy count alleges acts in furtherance of the conspiracy in both districts. The Maine judge thought that the thirteen counts alleging mailings from Boston charged an offense committed in that district, while the thirteen counts alleging mailings from Maine constituted an offense committed there, and that only the conspiracy count alleged an offense committed in both districts. Since the indictment, under the Hughes Tool Co. decision, could not be chopped up so as to transfer part of the counts to one district and keep the others in the district where prosecution had been brought, the Maine court reached the logical conclusion that the whole transfer to it had been without authority of law and ordered the whole matter sent back to where it came from.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the logic was all right, but the major premise was wrong. If we can demonstrate the correctness of that conclusion the difficulty in this case will disappear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute says: \"Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, * * * shall, for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, <i>place,</i> or <i>cause to be placed,</i> any letter * * * in any post office * * * or shall <i>knowingly cause to be delivered</i> * * * any such letter * * * shall be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both [emphasis added].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Note that it describes three acts in the disjunctive. The Maine judge thought that those three acts were three separate crimes and he relied upon what we think is inadvertent language in a Second Circuit per curiam opinion to that effect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We do not think that the disjunctive phrases in the statute charge three separate crimes. We think that they describe three alternative means by which one may commit a single crime, namely, use of the mails to defraud. If that is right there is no duplicity in an indictment which charges the statutory crime in the alternative language.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interpretation which we give to the statute seems to us the fair one. Surely if a man sent one fraudulent letter he could not be convicted and sentenced to consecutive terms for (1) mailing the letter, (2) causing it to be placed in any post office, and (3) knowingly causing it to be delivered. The transaction concerning each letter which he sends is no doubt a separate offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> But we do not think that mailing, causing to be mailed and delivery of one letter constitutes three offenses for which three separate prosecutions will lie.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that the Supreme Court has in effect so held in Hagner v. United States, 1932, 285 U.S. 427, 52 S.Ct. 417, 418, 76 L.Ed. 861. There the defendants were prosecuted and convicted in the District of Columbia upon an indictment which charged in one count that they \"did place and caused to be placed\" in a Scranton, Pennsylvania, post office a letter \"to be sent and delivered\" to a designated address in the District of Columbia. They moved in arrest of judgment upon the ground that the indictment failed to charge any offense within the District of Columbia and charged only an offense committed in Pennsylvania. The Court said, however, that proof that a letter properly directed was placed in a post office creates a presumption that it reached its destination and was received by the addressee. A charge of mailing, therefore, in Pennsylvania of a letter addressed to a person in the District of Columbia charged an offense within the District of Columbia as well as one in Pennsylvania. And such an indictment is not bad for duplicity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The conviction was, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems to us that this authoritatively disposes of any loose talk about one mailing constituting three offenses. It also seems to hold authoritatively that, other elements of the crime being proved to be present, proof of mailing a letter in a post office in one district properly addressed to a person in another district alleges a crime which may be tried in either district. It being a crime, part of which is committed in one district and part of which is committed in another, Rule 21(b) is applicable. The question of which district is the more appropriate place for trial is then a matter for the discretion of the judge before whom the motion to transfer is made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That being so, this indictment was properly brought in Massachusetts. The motion to transfer it to Maine was a matter for the discretion of the Massachusetts judge to whom the motion was presented. We have no reason to think that the discretion he did exercise by ordering the transfer to Maine was improperly exercised. Furthermore, the transfer order can no more be reviewed by the District Court in Maine at this stage of the proceedings than it can by us. In any event, the defendant cannot complain about that order because he made the motion to transfer. We think the Maine District Judge was led into error by being pressed with the decision in the Hughes Tool Co. case coupled with the language which indicated that the statutory provision covered three crimes, not one. We think there was too much emphasis on the dictum in United States v. Guest, 2 Cir., 1935, 74 F.2d 730, and too little emphasis upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the Hagner case. The case was properly transferable to Maine and should be tried there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeals will be dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> \"The court upon motion of the defendant shall transfer the proceeding as to him to another district or division, if it appears from the indictment or information or from a bill of particulars that the offense was committed in more than one district or division and if the court is satisfied that in the interest of justice the proceeding should be transferred to another district or division in which the commission of the offense is charged.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> \"The courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all<i>final decisions</i> of the district courts of the United States * * * [emphasis added].\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> 28 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1404</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> United States v. Guest, 2 Cir., 1935, 74 F.2d 730. The Maine court also cited In re Henry, 1887, 123 U.S. 372, 8 S.Ct. 142, 31 L.Ed. 174 and Mitchell v. United States, 10 Cir., 1944, 142 F.2d 480. In the Henry case, the Supreme Court indicated that each letter gives rise to a separate and distinct offense. The Mitchell case is to the same effect</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In re Henry, 1887, 123 U.S. 372, 8 S.Ct. 142, 31 L.Ed. 174; Mitchell v.

United States, 4 Cir., 1917, 247 F. 874. A count is duplicitous only if each offense it alleges requires proof of some fact or element not required to establish the others. Cf. Ekberg v. United States, 1 Cir., 1948, 167 F.2d 380, 384-388. The Hagner case teaches that proof of mailing establishes delivery as well. Furthermore, the doing of the prohibited thing, in each and all of the prohibited modes, may be charged in one count. Crain v. United States, 1896, 162 U.S. 625, 636, 16 S.Ct. 952, 40 L.Ed. 1097; Rowan v. United States, 5 Cir., 1922, 281 F. 137</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Stewart-Warner Corp., 4 Cir., 1949, 177 F.2d 360. We can see no ground for treating Rule 21(b) differently in this respect from the corresponding civil transfer provisions of 28 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1404.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What has been said disposes of the appeals. But since this case should be tried or otherwise disposed of and since those concerned are in evident confusion as to the appropriate forum, the practical need for clarification overcomes the reluctance to issue what may be termed obiter dictum. We proceed therefore to state the legal problem and its answer as it appears to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Judge in Maine was confronted by the decision of the District Court of Hawaii in United States v. Hughes Tool Co., D.C. Hawaii 1948, 78 F. Supp. 409. The court in that case held that indictments must be tried in the district having jurisdiction of all of its counts and that if only some were transferable under Rule 21(b), the transfer could not be made. Although that case did not involve prosecution for using the mails to defraud, the Maine court in this case thought it was applicable to the indictment before it. The reason why that conclusion was reached and why we think it is incorrect will be stated presently. We want it to be clear that we are neither approving nor disapproving the Hughes Tool Co. case because in our view it does not bear upon the problem presented here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This indictment, it will be remembered, contains thirteen counts charging the mailing of letters from Boston, Massachusetts, to Sanford, Maine. It also contains thirteen counts for mailing letters from Sanford, Maine, to Boston, Massachusetts. The conspiracy count alleges acts in furtherance of the conspiracy in both districts. The Maine judge thought that the thirteen counts alleging mailings from Boston charged an offense committed in that district, while the thirteen counts alleging mailings from Maine constituted an offense committed there, and that only the conspiracy count alleged an offense committed in both districts. Since the indictment, under the Hughes Tool Co. decision, could not be chopped up so as to transfer part of the counts to one district and keep the others in the district where prosecution had been brought, the Maine court reached the logical conclusion that the whole transfer to it had been without authority of law and ordered the whole matter sent back to where it came from.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the logic was all right, but the major premise was wrong. If we can demonstrate the correctness of that conclusion the difficulty in this case will disappear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute says: \"Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, * * * shall, for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, <i>place,</i> or <i>cause to be placed,</i> any letter * * * in any post office * * * or shall <i>knowingly cause to be delivered</i> * * * any such letter * * * shall be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both [emphasis added].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Note that it describes three acts in the disjunctive. The Maine judge thought that those three acts were three separate crimes and he relied upon what we think is inadvertent language in a Second Circuit per curiam opinion to that effect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We do not think that the disjunctive phrases in the statute charge three separate crimes. We think that they describe three alternative means by which one may commit a single crime, namely, use of the mails to defraud. If that is right there is no duplicity in an indictment which charges the statutory crime in the alternative language.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interpretation which we give to the statute seems to us the fair one. Surely if a man sent one fraudulent letter he could not be convicted and sentenced to consecutive terms for (1) mailing the letter, (2) causing it to be placed in any post office, and (3) knowingly causing it to be delivered. The transaction concerning each letter which he sends is no doubt a separate offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> But we do not think that mailing, causing to be mailed and delivery of one letter constitutes three offenses for which three separate prosecutions will lie.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that the Supreme Court has in effect so held in Hagner v. United States, 1932, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101897\"><a href=\"/opinion/101897/hagner-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></span>, 418, 76 L.Ed. 861. There the defendants were prosecuted and convicted in the District of Columbia upon an indictment which charged in one count that they \"did place and caused to be placed\" in a Scranton, Pennsylvania, post office a letter \"to be sent and delivered\" to a designated address in the District of Columbia. They moved in arrest of judgment upon the ground that the indictment failed to charge any offense within the District of Columbia and charged only an offense committed in Pennsylvania. The Court said, however, that proof that a letter properly directed was placed in a post office creates a presumption that it reached its destination and was received by the addressee. A charge of mailing, therefore, in Pennsylvania of a letter addressed to a person in the District of Columbia charged an offense within the District of Columbia as well as one in Pennsylvania. And such an indictment is not bad for duplicity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The conviction was, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems to us that this authoritatively disposes of any loose talk about one mailing constituting three offenses. It also seems to hold authoritatively that, other elements of the crime being proved to be present, proof of mailing a letter in a post office in one district properly addressed to a person in another district alleges a crime which may be tried in either district. It being a crime, part of which is committed in one district and part of which is committed in another, Rule 21(b) is applicable. The question of which district is the more appropriate place for trial is then a matter for the discretion of the judge before whom the motion to transfer is made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That being so, this indictment was properly brought in Massachusetts. The motion to transfer it to Maine was a matter for the discretion of the Massachusetts judge to whom the motion was presented. We have no reason to think that the discretion he did exercise by ordering the transfer to Maine was improperly exercised. Furthermore, the transfer order can no more be reviewed by the District Court in Maine at this stage of the proceedings than it can by us. In any event, the defendant cannot complain about that order because he made the motion to transfer. We think the Maine District Judge was led into error by being pressed with the decision in the Hughes Tool Co. case coupled with the language which indicated that the statutory provision covered three crimes, not one. We think there was too much emphasis on the dictum in United States v. Guest, 2 Cir., 1935, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></span>, and too little emphasis upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the Hagner case. The case was properly transferable to Maine and should be tried there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeals will be dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> \"The court upon motion of the defendant shall transfer the proceeding as to him to another district or division, if it appears from the indictment or information or from a bill of particulars that the offense was committed in more than one district or division and if the court is satisfied that in the interest of justice the proceeding should be transferred to another district or division in which the commission of the offense is charged.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> \"The courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all<i>final decisions</i> of the district courts of the United States * * * [emphasis added].\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> 28 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1404</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> United States v.
