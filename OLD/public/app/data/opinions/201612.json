The Credit Repair Organizations\n\nAct (CROA or the Act) creates a cause of action for consumers\n\nharmed by the unscrupulous business and advertising practices on\n\nthe part of credit repair organizations.          See 15 U.S.C. § 1679 et\n\nseq.       But the Act does not permit lawsuits against \"any nonprofit\n\norganization which is exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3)\"\n\nof the Internal Revenue Code.      See 15 U.S.C. § 1679a(3)(B)(i).   The\n\nquestion we face is whether an Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\n\ndetermination that an entity is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3)\n\nis sufficient to bring the entity within the statutory exclusion\n\nset forth in § 1679(a)(3)(B)(i).\n\n                                     I.\n\n               Saddled with substantial debt, the plaintiffs, Andrew and\n\nKelly Zimmerman, sought assistance from Cambridge Credit Counseling\n\nCorporation (Cambridge) near the end of 2001.1         The plaintiffs had\n\nseen advertising from Cambridge claiming that it could help debtors\n\nobtain lower interest rates, eliminate fees, re-age debt, and\n\notherwise assist in debt management efforts.          The plaintiffs say\n\nthat they were drawn to Cambridge because it identified itself as\n\na nonprofit organization.       This led the plaintiffs to believe that\n\nCambridge would charge low fees for its services.           Cambridge is\n\n\n       1\n      As this appeal arises from the grant of the defendants'\nmotion to dismiss, we accept the well pleaded allegations in the\ncomplaint as true. See Viqueira v. First Bank, 140 F.3d 12, 15\n(1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                    -2-\n\forganized as a charitable organization under Massachusetts law, see\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 180, and has obtained an IRS determination that\n\nit is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue\n\nCode,    see 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3).2\n\n            In early 2002, the plaintiffs enrolled with Cambridge.\n\nFor a fee of $948 per month, Cambridge developed a customized debt\n\nmanagement program for them.     Several months later, the plaintiffs\n\ncancelled    their   contract   with    Cambridge   after   they   became\n\ndissatisfied with its services.        At the time of cancellation, the\n\nplaintiffs owed more money and had worse credit scores than before\n\ncontracting with Cambridge. Believing that they had been swindled,\n\nthe plaintiffs sued Cambridge, its owners John and Richard Puccio,\n\nand several related entities for violations of the CROA.3            They\n\nalleged that Cambridge was subject to suit under the Act because\n\nits claimed nonprofit status was a sham.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Section 501(c)(3) specifies that, inter alia, charitable and\neducational organizations, whose net earnings do not benefit\nshareholders or individuals, are exempt from federal taxation. See\n26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3).\n     3\n      The plaintiffs also sued under the Fair Debt Collection\nPractices Act, see 15 U.S.C. § 1692, and state law. The district\ncourt dismissed the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act claim on\nstatute of limitations grounds and declined to exercise\njurisdiction over the state law claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(b).\nSee Zimmerman v. Cambridge Credit Counseling Corp., 322 F. Supp. 2d\n95, 98 & 101 (D. Mass. 2004). The plaintiffs have not appealed\nthese rulings.\n\n                                  -3-\n\f            The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the\n\nground     that    Cambridge       was    a     section   501(c)(3)         tax-exempt\n\norganization and therefore within the exclusion specified in 15\n\nU.S.C. § 1679a(3)(B)(i).           The district court agreed and dismissed\n\nthe CROA claim.         See Zimmerman,        322 F. Supp. 2d at 99-101.             The\n\ncourt found the CROA exclusion applicable because the IRS had\n\ndetermined that Cambridge qualified for section 501(c)(3) tax-\n\nexempt status.          See id.          The court based its interpretation\n\nprincipally on a policy rationale.                It concluded that permitting\n\ncourts to \"go behind the IRS's designation and proceed to make\n\ntheir own independent determinations, on a case-by-case basis, of\n\nan   entity's      substantive       classification       according        to    section\n\n501(c)(3)\"    would       create     excessive    uncertainty        concerning      the\n\nvalidity     of    an     entity's    tax-exempt      status,        and    that    this\n\nuncertainty       could    destabilize     the    operation     of    the       nonprofit\n\nsector.    See id. at 100.         The plaintiffs timely appealed.\n\n                                          II.\n\n            Our review of the district court's grant of the motion to\n\ndismiss is de novo.4         See Goldings v. Winn, 383 F.3d 17, 21 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).       At issue is the reach of 15 U.S.C. § 1679a(3)(B)(i),\n\n\n\n     4\n      The parties dispute whether the defendants' motion should\nhave been raised under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) or Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(b)(6). This dispute is immaterial because the parties agree\nthat either way we must accept the well pleaded allegations as true\nand consider the interpretive question de novo.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fwhich provides that \"a credit repair organization does not include\n\nany nonprofit organization which is exempt from taxation under\n\nsection 501(c)(3)\" of the Internal Revenue Code.        15 U.S.C. §\n\n1679a(3)(B)(i).   The plaintiffs argue that the exclusion requires\n\n(1) that the credit repair organization actually operates as a\n\nnonprofit entity and (2) that the credit repair organization meets\n\nthe eligibility requirements in in section 501(c)(3) of the tax\n\ncode. The defendants respond that the phrase \"exempt from taxation\n\nunder   section   501(c)(3)\"   defines   \"nonprofit   organization.\"\n\nTherefore, the defendants contend that a credit repair organization\n\nmust only have received section 501(c)(3) from the IRS to qualify\n\nfor the exclusion.\n\n          \"As in any case of statutory construction, our analysis\n\nbegins with the language of the statute.\"    Hughes Aircraft Co. v.\n\nJacobson, 525 U.S. 432, 438 (1999) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted). The Act qualifies a large group of entities for\n\nthe exclusion -- all nonprofit organizations -- and then limits the\n\nexcluded group to a smaller group of nonprofit organizations \"which\n\nare tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) . . . .\"         15 U.S.C. §\n\n1679a(3)(B)(i).   The most natural reading of the text is that it\n\nestablishes two requirements. The nonprofit language excludes some\n\nentities from eligibility (namely, profit making entities), and the\n\n\"tax-exempt\" language distills the excluded group to the kinds of\n\norganizations identified in section 501(c)(3) (e.g., charitable or\n\n                                -5-\n\feducational organizations) which are, in fact, tax-exempt. Read in\n\nthis way, the Act does not define \"nonprofit organization\" as an\n\nentity with section 501(c)(3) status but rather establishes two\n\nindependent       criteria     for   the   exclusion:         nonprofit      status   and\n\nsection 501(c)(3) status.\n\n            This plain reading of the exclusion is supported by the\n\nsurrounding text.       See Massachusetts v. Morash, 490 U.S. 107, 115\n\n(1989).     In addition to excluding nonprofit organizations with\n\nsection     501(c)(3)        status,   the       CROA       excludes   creditors      and\n\ndepository       institutions.       But   as    to     these    latter      exclusions,\n\nCongress defined the excluded entities by reference to another\n\nsection of the United States Code. See 15 U.S.C. § 1679a(3)(B)(ii)\n\n(excluding \"any creditor (as defined in section 1062 of this\n\ntitle)\"); 15 U.S.C. § 1679a(3)(B)(iii) (excluding \"any depository\n\ninstitution (as that term is defined in section 1813 of Title\n\n12)\"). Had the drafters of the CROA intended to define \"nonprofit\"\n\nsimply by reference to section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue\n\nCode,     they    had   at     their   disposal         a    method    for    doing    so\n\nunambiguously -- a method they employed for other exclusions under\n\nthe CROA.        See King v. St. Vincent's Hosp., 502 U.S. 215, 220-21\n\n(1991).\n\n            This drafting choice cannot be considered accidental\n\nbecause the United States Code is replete with statues which\n\nclearly define a \"nonprofit organization\" as an entity that is tax-\n\n                                           -6-\n\fexempt under the Internal Revenue Code.     Indeed, several statutes\n\nexpressly define a nonprofit organization to mean an organization\n\ndescribed under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.    See,\n\ne.g., 5 U.S.C. § 3102(a)(3) (stating that \"'nonprofit organization'\n\nmeans an organization determined by the Secretary of the Treasury\n\nto be an organization described in section 501(c) of the Internal\n\nRevenue Code of 1986\"); 16 U.S.C. § 1447a(5) (similar); 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2703(4) (similar); 42 U.S.C. § 1485(w)(1)(B) (similar); 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1760(d)(5) (similar); 42 U.S.C. § 5603(23) (similar).5       This\n\nconstruction links the definitional term \"nonprofit\" directly to\n\nthe organization's federal tax-exempt status.    We may assume that,\n\nwhen drafting the CROA, Congress was aware of this archetypal\n\nlanguage for equating nonprofit status with federal tax-exempt\n\nstatus.     See S. Dakota v. Yankton Sioux Tribe, 522 U.S. 329, 351\n\n(1998).     Yet Congress chose a different formulation for the CROA.\n\nThis is strong evidence that Congress did not intend to conflate\n\nnonprofit status with section 501(c)(3)tax-exempt status.6\n\n             The plaintiffs' interpretation of the exclusion also\n\nhonors the principle \"that '[a]ll words and provisions of statutes\n\n\n     5\n         These statutes predate the enactment of the CROA.\n     6\n      The legislative history is inconclusive. The only mention of\nthe exclusion appears in the House of Representatives Ways and\nMeans Committee report from the Congress preceding the one that\nenacted the CROA. H.R. Rep. No. 103-486 (1994), 1994 WL 164513.\n  This report states that the definition of a credit repair\norganization \"does not include a nonprofit organization.\" Id.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fare intended to have meaning and are to be given effect, and no\n\nconstruction should be adopted which would render statutory words\n\nor phrases meaningless, redundant, or superfluous.'\" United States\n\nv. Ven-Fuel, Inc., 758 F.2d 741, 751-52 (1st Cir. 1985)).               The\n\ndefendants read the exclusion as if it said only that the CROA\n\nexcludes    any   organization   \"which   is   tax-exempt   under   section\n\n501(c)(3). . . \"     They have ascribed no independent meaning to the\n\nterm \"nonprofit.\"\n\n            Additionally, the plaintiffs' reading is consonant with\n\nthe rule favoring the narrow construction of exclusions in remedial\n\nstatutes.    See Hogar Agua Y Vida En El Desierto, Inc. v. Suarez-\n\nMedina, 36 F.3d 177, 182 (1st Cir. 1994).          Congress enacted the\n\nCROA to remedy abuses in the credit repair industry.                The Act\n\nincludes a finding by Congress that \"[c]ertain advertising and\n\nbusiness practices of some companies engaged in the business of\n\ncredit repair services have worked a financial hardship upon\n\nconsumers, particularly those of limited economic means and who are\n\ninexperienced in credit matters.\"         15 U.S.C. § 1679(a)(2).       The\n\nCROA's expressed purpose is to \"to protect the public from unfair\n\nor deceptive advertising and business practices by credit repair\n\norganizations.\" 15 U.S.C. § 1679(b)(2). Its remedial goal is thus\n\nunmistakable.     See Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Gill, 265 F.3d 944, 949-50\n\n(9th Cir. 2001).\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f           If a credit repair organization only needed to obtain a\n\nsection 501(c)(3) designation to qualify for the exception, the\n\nexception might well eviscerate the liability-creating provisions.\n\nSee generally Marta Lugones Moakley, Credit Repair Organizations\n\nAfter Regulation, 77-AUG Fla. B.J. 28, 33 (2003) (describing the\n\nincrease in credit repair organizations seeking section 501(c)(3)\n\nstatus after the passage of the CROA).             After all, the IRS usually\n\ngrants section 501(c)(3) status based solely on representations\n\nmade by the applying entity.       See IRS Form 1023.          In fact, the IRS'\n\nsubsequent notification that an entity has qualified for tax-exempt\n\nstatus contains a disclaimer stating that the IRS has made its\n\ndetermination based solely on representations provided to it by the\n\nparty seeking the status. See Letter from IRS District Director to\n\nCambridge Credit Counseling Corp. of 2/12/98 at 1 (stating that\n\nsection   501    (c)(3)   status     is    granted    \"based    on    information\n\nsupplied, and assuming [that] operations will be as stated in your\n\napplication      for   recognition    of     the     exemption\").         And   the\n\ndetermination is not binding in subsequent litigation challenging\n\nthe   applying    entity's   tax-exempt       status.      See       26   U.S.C.   §\n\n6110(k)(3) (stating that \"a written determination [from the IRS]\n\nmay not be cited as precedent\").            Congress cannot have intended\n\nunscrupulous credit repair organizations to have such easy access\n\nto CROA immunity.      Cf. Edsen v. Bank of Boston, 229 F.3d 154, 177\n\n(2d Cir. 2000) (\"An erroneous ruling by an IRS key district\n\n                                      -9-\n\fdirector, especially when procured by submission of limited or\n\nconfusing information, cannot defeat the express statutory rights\n\nof [consumers].           The adjudication of those rights is for the\n\nfederal courts, not the field offices of the IRS.\").\n\n             The      district           court      rejected       the      plaintiffs'\n\ninterpretation of the exclusion out of understandable concern that\n\npermitting     a    court       to    decide     whether   an   entity     is    actually\n\noperating      as     a       nonprofit     organization        will      substantially\n\ndestabilize the nonprofit sector.                  See Zimmerman, 322 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 99-100.     The concern is two-fold.                First, it will unsettle the\n\nexpectations of the tax-exempt organization and those interacting\n\nwith it if section 501(c)(3) status can be lost in non-tax related\n\nlitigation.          Second,         subjecting    a   nonprofit     organization      to\n\nlitigation over its status will significantly raise its cost of\n\ndoing business.               Two responses to these concerns immediately\n\nsuggest themselves.\n\n             First,       a    determination       that    an   organization      is   not\n\noperating as a nonprofit for purposes of the CROA will not directly\n\nimpact   the        organization's         tax-exempt       status       under    section\n\n501(c)(3).     Whether an entity is entitled to federal tax-exempt\n\nstatus is a determination that is committed, in the first instance,\n\nto the IRS.        See Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574,\n\n596-97 (1982).        True, a determination under the CROA that a credit\n\nrepair organization is not operating as a nonprofit will likely\n\n                                           -10-\n\fcatch the attention of the IRS.            But there are already processes\n\nfor alerting the IRS to improvident grants of tax-exempt status.\n\nThere is a procedure for the IRS to field complaints about an\n\nentity's      abuse     of        its     tax-exempt       status.          See\n\nwww.irs.gov/compliance/enforcement (last visited May 5, 2005).\n\nMoreover,    Congress   itself     occasionally    holds    hearings   on   the\n\nmatter.7    Thus, a finding that a credit repair organization is not\n\noperating as a nonprofit for purposes of the CROA will be just\n\nanother source of information from which the IRS can decide to\n\ntarget a particular credit repair organization for review.                  But\n\nsuch a finding will not mean that a credit repair organization\n\nloses its tax-exempt status without further action by the IRS.8\n\n            Second,     it   is     already     common     for   courts     and\n\nadministrative agencies to examine whether an entity actually\n\n     7\n      Indeed, Congress has held hearings on the abuse of tax-exempt\nstatus by credit counseling and repair organizations. See Section\n501(c)(3) Credit Counseling Organizations:      Hearing Before the\nHouse of Representatives Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight,\n108th Cong. (2003); Profiteering in a Non-Profit Industry: Abusive\nPractices in Credit Counseling: Hearing Before the Senate\nGovernmental Affairs Subcommittee on Investigations, 108th Cong.\n(2004). The IRS has responded with an initiative to review the\ngranting of tax-exempt status in this industry. See IRS Fact Sheet\n2003-17, IRS Takes Steps to Ensure Credit Counseling Organizations\nComply with Requirements for Tax-Exempt Status (Oct. 2003).\n     8\n      In any event, even if a determination under the CROA could\ndirectly impact an organization's tax-exempt status, it would not\ntypically affect the interests of those doing business with it.\nSee Letter from IRS District Director to Cambridge of 2/12/98, at\n1 (stating that \"contributors may rely on determination [of tax-\nexempt status] unless the Internal Revenue Service publishes notice\nto the contrary\").\n\n                                        -11-\n\foperates as a nonprofit, irrespective of its tax-exempt status.\n\nFor example, the Federal Trade Commission, which does not have\n\njurisdiction over nonprofit organizations,         see 15 U.S.C. §§ 44 &\n\n45(a), determines, without reference to a target organization's\n\ntax-exempt status, whether the organization in fact operates as a\n\nnonprofit and is therefore beyond its jurisdiction. See In re Ohio\n\nChristian Coll., 80 F.T.C. 815, 848-49 (1972).             Similarly, state\n\ncourts frequently inquire into whether an entity actually operates\n\nas a nonprofit to determine whether the entity is entitled to tax-\n\nexemptions reserved for nonprofits.        See, e.g., W. Mass. Lifecare\n\nCorp. v. Bd. of Assessors, 747 N.E.2d 97, 103 (Mass. 2001) (\"The\n\nmere fact that the organization . . . has been organized as a\n\ncharitable corporation does not automatically mean that it is\n\nentitled   to   an   exemption   for     its   property.      Rather,   the\n\norganization must prove that it is in fact so conducted that in\n\nactual operation it is a public charity.\") (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citations omitted).9\n\n\n     9\n      In addition to relying on the district court's policy\nrationale, the defendants contend that their interpretation of the\nexclusion is superior because of the rule of construction providing\nthat a specific term in a statute (viz. \"exempt from taxation under\nsection 501(c)(3)\") governs over a more general term (viz.\n\"nonprofit organization\"). See Morales v. Trans World Airlines,\nInc., 504 U.S. 374, 384 (1992). But this rule of interpretation\napplies only \"where there is inescapable conflict between\" the\nstatute's terms. 2A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and\nStatutory Construction § 46.05, at 177 (2000).         Because the\ninterpretation we adopt gives different meanings to \"nonprofit\" and\n\"exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3),\" this rule of\n\n                                  -12-\n\f              In sum, to be excluded from the CROA under 15 U.S.C. §\n\n1679a(3)(B)(i), a credit repair organization must actually operate\n\nas a nonprofit organization and be exempt from taxation under\n\nsection    501(c)(3).   Having   reached   this   conclusion,   we   must\n\nidentify the standard to be applied in deciding whether an entity\n\nsatisfies the \"nonprofit\" component of the exclusion.\n\n            Where Congress left \"nonprofit\" undefined in an exclusion\n\nfrom another statutory scheme, we concluded that \"nonprofit\" status\n\ndepended primarily on proof that the entity did \"not distribute\n\nprofits to stockholders or others.\"        See Town of Brookline v.\n\nGorsuch,    667 F.2d 215, 221 (1st Cir. 1981).      This is consistent\n\nwith the standard definition of the term:     a nonprofit corporation\n\nis \"a corporation organized for some purpose other than making a\n\nprofit.\"    Black's Law Dictionary at 367 (8th ed. 1999); see also\n\nBruce Hopkins, The Law of Tax-Exempt Organizations 5 (8th ed. 2003)\n\n(A \"nonprofit organization . . . is not permitted to distribute its\n\nprofits . . . to those who control it . . . .\").        Here, we apply\n\nthe standard defintion.\n\n            For motion to dismiss purposes, the plaintiffs' complaint\n\nsufficiently alleges that Cambridge was not, in fact, operating as\n\n\n\n\nconstruction does not apply.\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fa nonprofit organization.10      The complaint states that, while\n\nCambridge claimed that its purpose was \"to provide direct aid to\n\nfinancially distressed debtors,\" in reality \"Cambridge's primary\n\npurpose was to make money for its owners and operators, John and\n\nRichard Puccio.\"    The complaint further claims that the Puccios\n\nnever intended to operate Cambridge as a nonprofit, but rather\n\nintended to use it \"to enrich themselves and their key executives\n\nby permitting them to siphon off corporate assets of their business\n\nthrough   huge   compensation   packages.\"   In   support   of   this\n\nallegation, the complaint alleges that the Puccios and their key\n\nexecutives have received exorbitant salaries from Cambridge. These\n\nallegations, if true, could support a finding that Cambridge was\n\nnot actually operating as a nonprofit organization and is therefore\n\nsubject to the CROA.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment and remand\n\nfor proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     10\n      The parties have not briefed which side has the burden of\nproof on this issue. The majority view is that the burden rests\nwith Cambridge. See United States v. Columbus Country Club, 915\nF.2d 877, 881-82 (3d Cir. 1990); United States v. Lansdowne Swim\nClub, 894 F.2d 83, 85 (3d Cir. 1990); Quijano v. Univ. Fed. Credit\nUnion, 617 F.2d 129, 132 (5th Cir. 1980); Nesmith v. YMCA, 397 F.2d\n96, 101 (4th Cir. 1968). But there is contrary authority. See\nEEOC v. Chicago Club, 86 F.3d 1423, 1429 (7th Cir. 1996). We do\nnot take a position on this question because, even if the\nplaintiffs shoulder the burden of proof, their complaint is\nadequate for motion to dismiss purposes.\n\n                                 -14-\n\f",

The Credit Repair Organizations\n\nAct (CROA or the Act) creates a cause of action for consumers\n\nharmed by the unscrupulous business and advertising practices on\n\nthe part of credit repair organizations.          See 15 U.S.C. § 1679 et\n\nseq.

See 15 U.S.C. § 1679a(3)(B)(i).   The\n\nquestion we face is whether an Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\n\ndetermination that an entity is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3)\n\nis sufficient to bring the entity within the statutory exclusion\n\nset forth in § 1679(a)(3)(B)(i).\n\n                                     I.\n\n               Saddled with substantial debt, the plaintiffs, Andrew and\n\nKelly Zimmerman, sought assistance from Cambridge Credit Counseling\n\nCorporation (Cambridge) near the end of 2001.1         The plaintiffs had\n\nseen advertising from Cambridge claiming that it could help debtors\n\nobtain lower interest rates, eliminate fees, re-age debt, and\n\notherwise assist in debt management efforts.          The plaintiffs say\n\nthat they were drawn to Cambridge because it identified itself as\n\na nonprofit organization.       This led the plaintiffs to believe that\n\nCambridge would charge low fees for its services.           Cambridge is\n\n\n       1\n      As this appeal arises from the grant of the defendants'\nmotion to dismiss, we accept the well pleaded allegations in the\ncomplaint as true. See Viqueira v.

Several months later, the plaintiffs\n\ncancelled    their   contract   with    Cambridge   after   they   became\n\ndissatisfied with its services.

This dispute is immaterial because the parties agree\nthat either way we must accept the well pleaded allegations as true\nand consider the interpretive question de novo.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fwhich provides that \"a credit repair organization does not include\n\nany nonprofit organization which is exempt from taxation under\n\nsection 501(c)(3)\" of the Internal Revenue Code.        15 U.S.C. §\n\n1679a(3)(B)(i).   The plaintiffs argue that the exclusion requires\n\n(1) that the credit repair organization actually operates as a\n\nnonprofit entity and (2) that the credit repair organization meets\n\nthe eligibility requirements in in section 501(c)(3) of the tax\n\ncode. The defendants respond that the phrase \"exempt from taxation\n\nunder   section   501(c)(3)\"   defines   \"nonprofit   organization.\"\n\nTherefore, the defendants contend that a credit repair organization\n\nmust only have received section 501(c)(3) from the IRS to qualify\n\nfor the exclusion.\n\n          \"As in any case of statutory construction, our analysis\n\nbegins with the language of the statute.\"    Hughes Aircraft Co. v.\n\nJacobson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118261\"><a href=\"/opinion/118261/hughes-aircraft-co-v-jacobson/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 438 (1999) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted). The Act qualifies a large group of entities for\n\nthe exclusion -- all nonprofit organizations -- and then limits the\n\nexcluded group to a smaller group of nonprofit organizations \"which\n\nare tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) . . . .\"         15 U.S.C. §\n\n1679a(3)(B)(i).   The most natural reading of the text is that it\n\nestablishes two requirements. The nonprofit language excludes some\n\nentities from eligibility (namely, profit making entities), and the\n\n\"tax-exempt\" language distills the excluded group to the kinds of\n\norganizations identified in section 501(c)(3) (e.g., charitable or\n\n                                -5-\n\feducational organizations) which are, in fact, tax-exempt. Read in\n\nthis way, the Act does not define \"nonprofit organization\" as an\n\nentity with section 501(c)(3) status but rather establishes two\n\nindependent       criteria     for   the   exclusion:         nonprofit      status   and\n\nsection 501(c)(3) status.\n\n            This plain reading of the exclusion is supported by the\n\nsurrounding text.       See Massachusetts v.

In addition to excluding nonprofit organizations with\n\nsection     501(c)(3)        status,   the       CROA       excludes   creditors      and\n\ndepository       institutions.       But   as    to     these    latter      exclusions,\n\nCongress defined the excluded entities by reference to another\n\nsection of the United States Code. See 15 U.S.C. § 1679a(3)(B)(ii)\n\n(excluding \"any creditor (as defined in section 1062 of this\n\ntitle)\"); 15 U.S.C. § 1679a(3)(B)(iii) (excluding \"any depository\n\ninstitution (as that term is defined in section 1813 of Title\n\n12)\"). Had the drafters of the CROA intended to define \"nonprofit\"\n\nsimply by reference to section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue\n\nCode,     they    had   at     their   disposal         a    method    for    doing    so\n\nunambiguously -- a method they employed for other exclusions under\n\nthe CROA.

Indeed, several statutes\n\nexpressly define a nonprofit organization to mean an organization\n\ndescribed under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.    See,\n\ne.g., 5 U.S.C. § 3102(a)(3) (stating that \"'nonprofit organization'\n\nmeans an organization determined by the Secretary of the Treasury\n\nto be an organization described in section 501(c) of the Internal\n\nRevenue Code of 1986\"); 16 U.S.C. § 1447a(5) (similar); 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2703(4) (similar); 42 U.S.C. § 1485(w)(1)(B) (similar); 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1760(d)(5) (similar); 42 U.S.C. § 5603(23) (similar).5       This\n\nconstruction links the definitional term \"nonprofit\" directly to\n\nthe organization's federal tax-exempt status.    We may assume that,\n\nwhen drafting the CROA, Congress was aware of this archetypal\n\nlanguage for equating nonprofit status with federal tax-exempt\n\nstatus.     See S. Dakota v.

And   the\n\ndetermination is not binding in subsequent litigation challenging\n\nthe   applying    entity's   tax-exempt       status.      See       26   U.S.C.   §\n\n6110(k)(3) (stating that \"a written determination [from the IRS]\n\nmay not be cited as precedent\").            Congress cannot have intended\n\nunscrupulous credit repair organizations to have such easy access\n\nto CROA immunity.      Cf. Edsen v. Bank of Boston, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 177\n\n(2d Cir. 2000) (\"An erroneous ruling by an IRS key district\n\n                                      -9-\n\fdirector, especially when procured by submission of limited or\n\nconfusing information, cannot defeat the express statutory rights\n\nof [consumers].           The adjudication of those rights is for the\n\nfederal courts, not the field offices of the IRS.\").\n\n             The      district           court      rejected       the      plaintiffs'\n\ninterpretation of the exclusion out of understandable concern that\n\npermitting     a    court       to    decide     whether   an   entity     is    actually\n\noperating      as     a       nonprofit     organization        will      substantially\n\ndestabilize the nonprofit sector.                  See Zimmerman, 322 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 99-100.     The concern is two-fold.                First, it will unsettle the\n\nexpectations of the tax-exempt organization and those interacting\n\nwith it if section 501(c)(3) status can be lost in non-tax related\n\nlitigation.          Second,         subjecting    a   nonprofit     organization      to\n\nlitigation over its status will significantly raise its cost of\n\ndoing business.               Two responses to these concerns immediately\n\nsuggest themselves.\n\n             First,       a    determination       that    an   organization      is   not\n\noperating as a nonprofit for purposes of the CROA will not directly\n\nimpact   the        organization's         tax-exempt       status       under    section\n\n501(c)(3).     Whether an entity is entitled to federal tax-exempt\n\nstatus is a determination that is committed, in the first instance,\n\nto the IRS.        See Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n596-97 (1982).        True, a determination under the CROA that a credit\n\nrepair organization is not operating as a nonprofit will likely\n\n                                           -10-\n\fcatch the attention of the IRS.            But there are already processes\n\nfor alerting the IRS to improvident grants of tax-exempt status.\n\nThere is a procedure for the IRS to field complaints about an\n\nentity's      abuse     of        its     tax-exempt       status.          See\n\nwww.irs.gov/compliance/enforcement (last visited May 5, 2005).\n\nMoreover,    Congress   itself     occasionally    holds    hearings   on   the\n\nmatter.7    Thus, a finding that a credit repair organization is not\n\noperating as a nonprofit for purposes of the CROA will be just\n\nanother source of information from which the IRS can decide to\n\ntarget a particular credit repair organization for review.                  But\n\nsuch a finding will not mean that a credit repair organization\n\nloses its tax-exempt status without further action by the IRS.8\n\n            Second,     it   is     already     common     for   courts     and\n\nadministrative agencies to examine whether an entity actually\n\n     7\n      Indeed, Congress has held hearings on the abuse of tax-exempt\nstatus by credit counseling and repair organizations. See Section\n501(c)(3) Credit Counseling Organizations:      Hearing Before the\nHouse of Representatives Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight,\n108th Cong. (2003); Profiteering in a Non-Profit Industry: Abusive\nPractices in Credit Counseling: Hearing Before the Senate\nGovernmental Affairs Subcommittee on Investigations, 108th Cong.\n(2004). The IRS has responded with an initiative to review the\ngranting of tax-exempt status in this industry. See IRS Fact Sheet\n2003-17, IRS Takes Steps to Ensure Credit Counseling Organizations\nComply with Requirements for Tax-Exempt Status (Oct. 2003).\n     8\n      In any event, even if a determination under the CROA could\ndirectly impact an organization's tax-exempt status, it would not\ntypically affect the interests of those doing business with it.\nSee Letter from IRS District Director to Cambridge of 2/12/98, at\n1 (stating that \"contributors may rely on determination [of tax-\nexempt status] unless the Internal Revenue Service publishes notice\nto the contrary\").\n\n                                        -11-\n\foperates as a nonprofit, irrespective of its tax-exempt status.\n\nFor example, the Federal Trade Commission, which does not have\n\njurisdiction over nonprofit organizations,         see 15 U.S.C. §§ 44 &\n\n45(a), determines, without reference to a target organization's\n\ntax-exempt status, whether the organization in fact operates as a\n\nnonprofit and is therefore beyond its jurisdiction. See In re Ohio\n\nChristian Coll., 80 F.T.C. 815, 848-49 (1972).             Similarly, state\n\ncourts frequently inquire into whether an entity actually operates\n\nas a nonprofit to determine whether the entity is entitled to tax-\n\nexemptions reserved for nonprofits.        See, e.g., W. Mass. Lifecare\n\nCorp. v. Bd. of Assessors, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">747</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103 (Mass. 2001) (\"The\n\nmere fact that the organization . . . has been organized as a\n\ncharitable corporation does not automatically mean that it is\n\nentitled   to   an   exemption   for     its   property.      Rather,   the\n\norganization must prove that it is in fact so conducted that in\n\nactual operation it is a public charity.\") (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citations omitted).9\n\n\n     9\n      In addition to relying on the district court's policy\nrationale, the defendants contend that their interpretation of the\nexclusion is superior because of the rule of construction providing\nthat a specific term in a statute (viz. \"exempt from taxation under\nsection 501(c)(3)\") governs over a more general term (viz.\n\"nonprofit organization\"). See Morales v. Trans World Airlines,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112742\"><a href=\"/opinion/112742/morales-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 384 (1992). But this rule of interpretation\napplies only \"where there is inescapable conflict between\" the\nstatute's terms. 2A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and\nStatutory Construction § 46.05, at 177 (2000).         Because the\ninterpretation we adopt gives different meanings to \"nonprofit\" and\n\"exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3),\" this rule of\n\n                                  -12-\n\f              In sum, to be excluded from the CROA under 15 U.S.C. §\n\n1679a(3)(B)(i), a credit repair organization must actually operate\n\nas a nonprofit organization and be exempt from taxation under\n\nsection    501(c)(3).   Having   reached   this   conclusion,   we   must\n\nidentify the standard to be applied in deciding whether an entity\n\nsatisfies the \"nonprofit\" component of the exclusion.\n\n            Where Congress left \"nonprofit\" undefined in an exclusion\n\nfrom another statutory scheme, we concluded that \"nonprofit\" status\n\ndepended primarily on proof that the entity did \"not distribute\n\nprofits to stockholders or others.\"        See Town of Brookline v.\n\nGorsuch,    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398205\"><a href=\"/opinion/398205/town-of-brookline-v-anne-mcgill-gorsuch-administrator-of-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 221 (1st Cir. 1981).      This is consistent\n\nwith the standard definition of the term:     a nonprofit corporation\n\nis \"a corporation organized for some purpose other than making a\n\nprofit.\"    Black's Law Dictionary at 367 (8th ed. 1999); see also\n\nBruce Hopkins, The Law of Tax-Exempt Organizations 5 (8th ed. 2003)\n\n(A \"nonprofit organization . . . is not permitted to distribute its\n\nprofits . . . to those who control it . . . .\").        Here, we apply\n\nthe standard defintion.\n\n            For motion to dismiss purposes, the plaintiffs' complaint\n\nsufficiently alleges that Cambridge was not, in fact, operating as\n\n\n\n\nconstruction does not apply.\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fa nonprofit organization.10      The complaint states that, while\n\nCambridge claimed that its purpose was \"to provide direct aid to\n\nfinancially distressed debtors,\" in reality \"Cambridge's primary\n\npurpose was to make money for its owners and operators, John and\n\nRichard Puccio.\"    The complaint further claims that the Puccios\n\nnever intended to operate Cambridge as a nonprofit, but rather\n\nintended to use it \"to enrich themselves and their key executives\n\nby permitting them to siphon off corporate assets of their business\n\nthrough   huge   compensation   packages.\"   In   support   of   this\n\nallegation, the complaint alleges that the Puccios and their key\n\nexecutives have received exorbitant salaries from Cambridge. These\n\nallegations, if true, could support a finding that Cambridge was\n\nnot actually operating as a nonprofit organization and is therefore\n\nsubject to the CROA.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment and remand\n\nfor proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     10\n      The parties have not briefed which side has the burden of\nproof on this issue.
