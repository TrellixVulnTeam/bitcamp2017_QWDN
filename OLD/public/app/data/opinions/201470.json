José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n            Torruella, Lynch, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Mark Diamond for appellant Jose Serrano-Beauvaix.\n     George J. West for appellant Mahmud Juma-Pineda.\n     Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nH.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-Sosa,\nAssistant United States Attorney, Senior Appellate Attorney, were\non brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                          March 4, 2005\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.            Jose Serrano-Beauvaix and Mahmud\n\nJuma-Pineda     were     participants       in   a     large   conspiracy       which\n\ntransported drugs under the protection of corrupt police officers\n\nin the Puerto Rico Police Department.             The conspiracy is described\n\nin United States v. Flecha-Maldonado, 373 F.3d 170, 172-74 (1st\n\nCir. 2004), upholding the conviction of one of Serrano's and Juma's\n\nco-conspirators.\n\n           In brief, Serrano, a former police officer who had been\n\nexpelled from the force, helped to recruit Juma, a police officer\n\nat the time, to provide armed escort for a shipment of ten\n\nkilograms of cocaine in October, 2000.                 Juma rode with the drugs\n\nand carried a pistol.           Serrano rode in another car and conducted\n\ncounter-surveillance and advised his codefendants through cell\n\nphones.   They each received a $5000 payment for their services in\n\nthe crime.\n\n           Each defendant pled guilty to charges of conspiracy to\n\ndistribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of\n\n21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a) and 846 (Count One), and of carrying firearms\n\n(and   aiding   and    abetting     of   same)    in    furtherance   of    a   drug\n\ntrafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(i) and\n\n2 (Count Three).       Each defendant stipulated to being personally\n\nresponsible for one kilogram of cocaine.                In the plea agreements,\n\neach   also     agreed     to     certain      sentencing      enhancements       and\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\facknowledged that each did not qualify for safety-valve treatment\n\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n          Serrano was sentenced to 63 months' imprisonment for\n\nCount One and a consecutive term of 60 months for Count Three.\n\nJuma was sentenced to 60 months' imprisonment for Count One and a\n\nconsecutive term of 60 months for Count Three.\n\n          Serrano appeals from his conviction for the firearms\n\ncount, contending that his guilty plea was procedurally flawed\n\nunder Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(3).1    We reject this argument because\n\nthere was no error during the Rule 11 colloquy.    Serrano and Juma\n\nboth appeal their sentences, raising a variety of arguments, most\n\nof which were waived by their plea agreements. Serrano also raises\n\na claim of plain error as to his sentence under United States v.\n\nBooker, 543 U.S. __, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).         We reject this\n\nargument as well because Serrano has failed to carry his burden\n\nthat there is a \"reasonable probability\" that he would be sentenced\n\nmore leniently under an advisory Guidelines system.      See United\n\nStates v. Antonakopoulos, No. 03-1384, 2005 WL 407365, at *4 (1st\n\nCir. Feb. 22, 2005).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Rule 11(b)(3) resulted from the recodification of its\npredecessor, Rule 11(f), in December of 2002. See United States v.\nVentura-Cruel, 356 F.3d 55, 60 n.5 (1st Cir. 2003). However, the\nchange in language between Rule 11(b)(3) and Rule 11(f) is only\nstylistic. Id.\n\n                               -3-\n\f                                  I.\n\nA.   Serrano's Appeal\n\n      1. The Guilty Plea To Count Three\n\n           Serrano argues for the first time on appeal that the\n\ndistrict court erred procedurally in accepting his guilty plea to\n\nCount Three.     His argument is that the district court failed to\n\n\"explore the factual basis of the guilty plea\" as required by Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 11(b)(3), which states: \"Before entering judgment on a\n\nguilty plea, the court must determine that there is a factual basis\n\nfor the plea.\"   Serrano argues that had the district court done so,\n\nit would have found that there was no factual basis for Serrano's\n\nguilty plea because Serrano only admitted to providing \"armed\n\ntransport\" for the drug shipment, but not to having possessed a\n\nfirearm.   The admission that he was \"armed\" was insufficient, he\n\nnow argues, because it might have meant that he was \"armed with a\n\nbig stick.\"\n\n           We review a Rule 11 challenge raised for the first time\n\non appeal only for plain error.        United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S.\n\n55, 74-76 (2002); United States v. Cheal, 389 F.3d        35, 40 (1st\n\nCir. 2004); see also United States v. Mills, 329 F.3d 24, 27 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (\"An error not objected to at the plea hearing is\n\nreversible only where the error is plain, affects the defendant's\n\nsubstantial rights, and seriously affects the fairness of the\n\nproceeding.\").    As to the underlying issue of compliance with the\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fRule, \"[o]n a plea, the question under Rule 11(f) [now Rule\n\n11(b)(3)] is not whether a jury would, or even would be likely, to\n\nconvict: it is whether there is enough evidence so that the plea\n\nhas a rational basis in facts that the defendant concedes or that\n\nthe government proffers as supported by credible evidence.\" United\n\nStates v. Gandia-Maysonet, 227 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2000).               In this\n\ncase, there was no error.\n\n           Serrano's argument mischaracterizes his plea colloquy by\n\nignoring   the   aiding   and    abetting    and   in    furtherance     of   the\n\nconspiracy aspects of the charge against him in Count Three.                  The\n\ndistrict court's Rule 11 colloquy focused on those aspects of the\n\ncharge.    It is irrelevant whether there were facts to show that\n\nSerrano was personally armed with a gun or a big stick.               During the\n\nRule 11 colloquy, Serrano specifically agreed that in \"aiding and\n\nabetting each other a gun was possessed in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy\"   (emphasis     added).       Furthermore,     Serrano's    counsel\n\nexplained that Serrano understood that although he \"did not carry\n\nthe   firearm\"   (emphasis      added),     he   was    responsible    for    the\n\nfirearm(s) carried by his codefendant(s) under Pinkerton v. United\n\nStates, 328 U.S. 640 (1946).       Rule 11(b)(3) is meant to \"protect a\n\ndefendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily with an\n\nunderstanding of the nature of the charge but without realizing\n\nthat his   conduct   does    not   actually      fall   within   the   charge.\"\n\nMcCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 467 (1969) (footnote and\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\finternal quotation marks omitted).       The district judge ascertained\n\nthat Serrano understood that he could be held liable for the\n\nfirearms charge without having carried the gun himself and that\n\nSerrano was aware of the gun Juma possessed as part of the \"armed\n\nescort\" they provided for the drug shipment.\n\n\n\n     2. The Sentence for Count One\n\n          Serrano brings a trio of challenges to his sentence as to\n\nCount One,2 and argues that we should remand to the district court\n\nfor resentencing in light of United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. __,\n\n125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).         First, he challenges the evidentiary\n\nsupport for his criminal record and his organizer role sentencing\n\nenhancement;   second,    he   argues    that   the   district   court   was\n\nconstrained    by   the   mandatory     Sentencing    Guidelines   and   so\n\nsentenced him to above the statutory minimum; third, he argues that\n\nhe should have been given the benefit of the safety valve.          We take\n\nup each challenge in turn.\n\n\n     2\n      Serrano's sentence was computed as follows: The stipulated\ndrug amount established a base offense level of 26. U.S.S.G. §\n2D1.1(c)(7). This base offense level was enhanced by two levels\nbecause of his role as an \"organizer, leader, manager, or\nsupervisor\" and reduced by three levels because of his acceptance\nof responsibility, yielding a final offense level of 25.        See\nU.S.S.G. §§ 3B1.1(c), 3E1.1(a)-(b). The base offense level and the\nenhancement calculations were all made a part of the plea agreement\nsigned by the defendant. His criminal history score was 3, which\nplaced him in criminal history category II. The Guidelines range\nwas therefore 63-78 months. U.S.S.G. Ch. 5 Pt. A. The statutory\nminimum under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B) for the offense Serrano pled\nguilty to is 60 months.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f     i.   We begin with Serrano's argument that there was no\n\nfactual support for either the finding 1) that Serrano's role\n\nduring the offense was that of an \"organizer, leader, manager, or\n\nsupervisor,\" justifying an increase in his offense level by two\n\nlevels, see U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c), or 2) that Serrano's criminal\n\nhistory placed him in criminal history category II.3        If the\n\ndistrict court erred in making these findings and, as a result,\n\nmisapplied sentencing enhancements under the Guidelines so as to\n\ncause prejudice to Serrano's sentence, the errors would justify\n\nremand for resentencing even under pre-Booker circuit precedent.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Thiongo, 344 F.3d 55, 63 (1st Cir.\n\n2003); United States v. McMinn, 103 F.3d 216, 219 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n          Serrano has waived his challenge to his organizer role\n\nenhancement.   The plea agreement stipulated that Serrano \"helped\n\n[another codefendant] contact and recruit a police officer to\n\nassist in the escort of the cocaine shipment.\"   The plea agreement\n\nalso included the stipulation that Serrano's offense level would be\n\nadjusted upwards by two levels under § 3B1.1 because he \"recruited\n\none of his co-defendants.\"   The district judge ascertained that\n\nSerrano understood and agreed to this adjustment.   At sentencing,\n\n\n     3\n      Without the role-enhancement, Serrano's final offense level\nwould have been 23, and combined with a criminal history category\nof II, would have produced a Guidelines sentencing range of 51-63\nmonths. U.S.S.G. Ch. 5 Pt. A. Similarly, if Serrano's criminal\nhistory category had been I, that, combined with a final offense\nlevel of 25, would have produced a Guidelines range of 57-71\nmonths. Id.\n\n                               -7-\n\fSerrano made no objection to the finding that he recruited a\n\ncodefendant.\n\n            As for Serrano's criminal history, \"[o]nce the government\n\nestablishes the existence of a prior conviction, the burden shifts\n\nto   the   defendant      to   show    that      the   earlier    conviction        was\n\nconstitutionally          infirm      or     otherwise       inappropriate          for\n\nconsideration.\"      United States v. Barbour, 393 F.3d 82, 93 (1st\n\nCir. 2004). At Serrano's detention hearing, his counsel stipulated\n\nto a criminal conviction in Humacao for violating Puerto Rico\n\nweapons laws. Serrano's pre-sentencing report (PSR), \"which can be\n\nused to satisfy the government's 'modest' burden,\" id. (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Gray, 177 F.3d 86, 89 (1st Cir. 1999)), detailed\n\nSerrano's prior conviction in commonwealth court in Humacao for\n\nviolating Puerto Rico weapons laws and calculated his criminal\n\nhistory score to be 3.         Serrano made no objection to his criminal\n\nhistory score in the PSR at his sentencing hearing.                          Serrano\n\nconceded that \"the probation officer has to follow what convictions\n\n[Serrano] has in the police of Puerto Rico records.\"                 In fact, the\n\nonly \"correction\" that Serrano's counsel wished to make to the PSR\n\nwas to \"reference . . . the actual number of the criminal case in\n\nHumacao,\"    and    the    court   agreed.         Serrano     admitted   to    this\n\nconviction     at   the     sentencing       hearing,    but     suggested     as     a\n\n\"mitigating argument\" that he had a \"solid alibi defense.\"                          The\n\ndistrict court properly rejected this argument.\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\f     ii.   Serrano next argues that his sentence on Count One should\n\nbe vacated and the case remanded for resentencing because the\n\ndistrict court was clearly constrained by the Guidelines during\n\nsentencing and imposed the 63-month term, which was above the\n\nstatutory minimum of 60 months, and was at the bottom of the\n\napplicable Guidelines range.        Post Booker, Serrano argues, the\n\ndistrict court could have (and would have) sentenced him to the\n\nstatutory minimum of 60 months.      Serrano made no arguments in the\n\ndistrict court questioning the constitutionality of the Guidelines\n\nor the application of the Guidelines to his sentence under Apprendi\n\nv. New Jersey, 520 U.S. 466 (2000), or Blakely v. Washington, 542\n\nU.S. __, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), so the Booker issue was not\n\npreserved.    See Antonakapolous, 2005 WL 407365, at *6.\n\n           We have recently set forth the applicable framework for\n\nreview of unpreserved Booker claims in Antonakopoulos.           Utilizing\n\nthe four-prong test in United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725 (1993),\n\nthere must be (1) an error (2) that is plain, and it (3) affects\n\nsubstantial    rights   and   (4)   seriously   impairs    the   fairness,\n\nintegrity,    or   public     reputation   of   judicial     proceedings.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 2005 WL 407365, at *4.     The first two prongs of the\n\nplain error test are met whenever the district court treated the\n\nGuidelines as mandatory at the time of sentencing.           Id.   But to\n\nmeet the third prong of the test, the defendant must persuade us\n\nthat there is a \"reasonable probability that the district court\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fwould impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant\n\nunder the new 'advisory Guidelines' Booker regime.\"          Id.     \"[I]t is\n\nthe defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of\n\npersuasion with respect to prejudice under plain-error analysis.\"\n\nId. at *6 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            Serrano relies upon the district judge's statement at the\n\nsentencing hearing: \"I have to consider the fact that I cannot\n\nsentence him to 60 months.        The lowest I can sentence him on that\n\nparticular situation is 63.\"       This statement, he argues, makes it\n\n\"clear that the district court would have sentenced [Serrano] to 60\n\nmonths in prison instead of 63 on count one.\"              Not so.         Given\n\nSerrano's criminal history category and his role as recruiter, and\n\nthe amount of drugs involved, the court's statement was a simple\n\nstatement    of   fact.      The    statutory    minimum,        without     the\n\nenhancements, was 60 months.       He was sentenced to 63 months, out of\n\na possible range of 63 to 78 months.       Serrano's argument amounts to\n\nan assertion that there was such a reasonable probability that the\n\njudge would have totally ignored Serrano's role in the offense and\n\nprior   conviction   and   that    our   confidence   in   the    outcome     is\n\nundermined by the fact that the judge actually considered these two\n\nenhancements.     Even post-Booker, the district court \"must consult\n\nthose Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\"\n\nBooker, 543 U.S. at __, 125 S. Ct. at 767.       And so the court had to\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fconsider both   role   in   the   offense    and   his   criminal   history.\n\nSerrano has failed to meet his burden.\n\n     iii. Serrano's final argument in his sentencing appeal is that\n\nthe district court committed error in denying him the benefit of\n\nthe provisions of the safety valve under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f) and\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5C1.2.      The argument, raised for the first time on\n\nappeal, is that but for the court's findings that Serrano had more\n\nthan one criminal history point and that Serrano was an organizer\n\nof the criminal activity, he would have qualified for safety-valve\n\ntreatment and thus be entitled to sentencing without regard to any\n\nstatutory minimum.\n\n          The effect of Booker, if any, on the safety valve has not\n\nbeen determined.     See Antonakopoulos, 2005 WL 407365, at *6 n.6.\n\nBut Serrano's argument is waived because Serrano explicitly agreed\n\nin his plea agreement that he did not qualify for safety-valve\n\ntreatment, and confirmed that he understood that he did not qualify\n\nfor the safety valve during his change of plea hearing.\n\n\n\nB. Juma's Appeal of His Sentence\n\n          Juma first argues that the district court erred by\n\nequating his carrying of his official police pistol during the\n\ncrime with disqualification from his entitlement to a downward\n\ndeparture under the safety valve.           See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f) and\n\nU.S.S.G. §§ 2D1.1(b)(7), 5C1.2. He argues that but for the finding\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fthat he carried his pistol during and in connection with the crime,\n\nhe would have qualified for safety-valve treatment and be sentenced\n\nbelow the statutory minimum.           Although he stipulated to having\n\n\"carried a pistol\" during the escort in his plea agreement, Juma\n\ncontends that the district court erred by not considering that he\n\nmay nonetheless qualify for the safety valve because the firearm\n\nwas not clearly connected to the offense.4             See United States v.\n\nBolka, 355 F.3d 909, 914 (6th Cir. 2004).\n\n             This argument is waived because Juma explicitly agreed in\n\nhis   plea   agreement   that    he   did    not   qualify   for   safety-valve\n\ntreatment, and confirmed that he understood that he did not qualify\n\nfor the safety valve during his change of plea hearing.\n\n             Juma's second argument is that a jury, not a judge,\n\nshould    have   made    the    factual     determinations    underlying    his\n\ndisqualification for the safety valve and the abuse of public trust\n\nenhancement.     By pleading guilty he waived consideration of the\n\nissues by a jury.\n\n                                      III.\n\n             Serrano's conviction and both defendants' sentences are\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n                          (Concurrence follows.)\n\n\n\n      4\n      During the drive to transport the drugs, Juma pulled out the\ngun to clean it in plain view.

I write separately, however, to explain why, if I were free\n\nto   do   so,    I     would   take   a   different    approach    to    reviewing\n\nunpreserved claims of Booker error.\n\n              Before explaining my differing views, however, I want to\n\nstress that I agree with much in Antonakopoulos.                I agree with its\n\ndescription of Booker error as inhering in the mandatory nature of\n\nthe sentencing guidelines, regardless of whether the sentence was\n\npremised    on    any    judge-found      facts.   I   agree,     too,    that    the\n\ndefendant has preserved a claim of Booker error if he argued below\n\nthat his sentence violated Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466\n\n(2000), or Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. __, 124 S. Ct. 2531\n\n(2004), or that the guidelines were unconstitutional. I agree that\n\nwe   should      not    remand   cases    automatically,   either        because    a\n\ndefendant's sentence was enhanced on the basis of judge-found facts\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\for because the sentence was imposed on the basis of mandatory\n\nguidelines.\n\n           My   one   disagreement    with   Antonakopoulos   is   crucial,\n\nhowever.      I do not believe that we should require defendants\n\ninvoking unpreserved Booker error to make a specific showing of\n\nprejudice (the reasonable probability of a different outcome) to\n\nsatisfy the third step of plain-error review.         Rather, such error\n\nshould entitle the defendant to a presumption of prejudice, which\n\nthe government can then try to rebut.        This approach, adopted by a\n\npanel of the Sixth Circuit in United States v. Barnett, No. 04-\n\n5252, 2005 WL 357015 (6th Cir. Feb. 16, 2005), is well grounded in\n\nSupreme Court precedent and has been applied by our sister circuits\n\nin other contexts \"where the inherent nature of the error made it\n\nexceptionally difficult for the defendant to demonstrate that the\n\noutcome of the lower court proceeding would have been different had\n\nthe error not occurred.\"     Id. at *9.      I wish to explain further my\n\nreasons for preferring this approach.\n\n                 1. The difficulty of reconstructing\n                  a hypothetical sentencing decision\n\n           Several courts of appeals considering unpreserved claims\n\nof Booker error have emphasized the difficulty of speculating about\n\nwhat a district-court judge would have done differently under an\n\nadvisory guidelines regime.     The Fourth Circuit admitted that: \"We\n\nsimply do not know how the district court would have sentenced\n\nHughes had it been operating under the regime established by\n\n                                     -14-\n\fBooker.\"    United States v. Hughes, 396 F.3d 374, 381 n.8 (4th Cir.\n\n2005).      Similarly, the Sixth Circuit wrote that \"even if we\n\nconclude    that    the   evidence    is   'overwhelming    and     essentially\n\nuncontroverted' we cannot know the length of imprisonment that the\n\ndistrict court judge would have imposed pursuant to this evidence\n\nfollowing Booker.\"        United States v. Oliver, No. 03-2126, 2005 WL\n\n233779, at *8 n.3 (6th Cir. Feb. 2, 2005) (quoting United States v\n\nCotton, 535 U.S. 625, 633 (2002)).              The Eleventh Circuit, too,\n\nafter    wondering     what   the    district     court    might    have    done\n\ndifferently, answered its own question:\n\n     The obvious answer is that we don't know.         If the\n     district court judge in this case had the liberty of\n     increasing or decreasing Rodriguez's sentence above or\n     below the guidelines range, he might have given Rodriguez\n     a longer sentence, or he might have given a shorter\n     sentence, or he might have given the same sentence. The\n     record provides no reason to believe any result is more\n     likely than the other. We just don't know.\n\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, No. 04-12676, 2005 WL 272952, at *9\n\n(11th Cir. 2005).\n\n            Indeed, the Second Circuit found this problem so vexing\n\nthat it chose to ask the district courts directly whether, in their\n\njudgment,    \"a    nontrivially     different   sentence    would    have   been\n\nimposed\" under advisory guidelines.          United States v. Crosby, No.\n\n03-1675, 2005 WL 240916, at *12 (2d Cir. Feb. 2, 2005).              The Second\n\nCircuit noted that\n\n     in many cases, it will be impossible to tell whether the\n     judge would have imposed the same sentence had the judge\n     not felt compelled to impose a Guidelines sentence. It\n\n                                      -15-\n\f      will also be impossible to tell what considerations\n      counsel for both sides might have brought to the\n      sentencing judge's attention had they known that they\n      could urge the judge to impose a non-Guidelines sentence.\n\nId. at *9.     The court chose to solve the problem by remanding any\n\ncase with unpreserved Booker error to the district courts, which\n\nwould then decide if resentencing was required.     Although I do not\n\nfavor the Second Circuit's remand approach, I understand the\n\nconcerns that motivated it.      So, too, did a panel of the Sixth\n\nCircuit in the Barnett decision.\n\n              2. Barnett and presumed prejudice in Olano\n\n             In Barnett, the court emphasized the difficulty faced by\n\ndefendants trying to demonstrate the prejudice that resulted from\n\nthe district court's application of mandatory guidelines, when\n\n\"well established case law substantially undermined any need or\n\nincentive for sentencing courts pre-Booker to note their objections\n\nand reservations in sentencing defendants under the then-mandatory\n\nGuidelines.\"     2005 WL 357015, at *4.   Consequently,\n\n      [i]t would be improper for this Court now to require\n      defendants such as Barnett to produce this type of\n      evidence--that sentencing courts had no reason to provide\n      under our pre-Booker case law--in order to establish that\n      their substantial rights have been affected. . . .\n      Instead of speculating as to the district court's\n      intentions in the pre-Booker world, and trying to apply\n      those intentions to predict the same court's sentence\n      under the post-Booker scheme, we are convinced that the\n      most prudent course of action in this case is to presume\n      prejudice. . . .\n\nId.\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f             Barnett reads United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725\n\n(1993), as suggesting that if a defendant would have extraordinary\n\ndifficulty    making   a   specific   showing   of   prejudice,   then   a\n\npresumption of prejudice may be appropriate.           Barnett, 2005 WL\n\n357015, at *9.    The government, of course, can try to rebut that\n\npresumption.     Id. at *12.      The dissent in Barnett maintains,\n\nhowever, that \"the Supreme Court has never put its imprimatur on\n\nthe idea that we may presume prejudice in plain error review,\" id.\n\nat *18.      It supported that assertion by observing that Olano\n\ndevotes just a sentence to the issue and then refused to consider\n\nit further.\n\n             That is not a fair reading of Olano.           After first\n\npositing a category of plain errors entitled to a presumption of\n\nprejudice, the Court found no reason to place the specific plain\n\nerror cited by the defendant (the presence of alternate jurors\n\nduring jury deliberations) in that category.           507 U.S. at 735.\n\nTrue, the Court declined to offer a strict definition of the\n\ncategory, seeing no need to \"address those errors that should be\n\npresumed prejudicial if the defendant cannot make a specific\n\nshowing of prejudice.\" Id. Later, however, the Court did confront\n\nthe question of whether Olano's error would belong to such a\n\ncategory, if it exists; it decided that \"we see no reason to\n\npresume prejudice here.\"     Id. at 737.   At the same time, the Court\n\nallowed that \"[t]here may be cases where an intrusion should be\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fpresumed prejudicial.\" Id. at 739.                In fact, the Court framed the\n\nbasic inquiry of its decision as: \"The question, then, is whether\n\nthe instant violation of Rule 24(c) prejudiced respondents, either\n\nspecifically or presumptively.\" Id. (emphasis added). Ultimately,\n\nthe Court did not think \"that the mere presence of alternate jurors\n\nentailed a sufficient risk of 'chill' to justify a presumption of\n\nprejudice on that score.\"             Id. at 741.     Nevertheless, its analysis\n\nforthrightly explored the possibility that some kinds of errors\n\nwould justify such a presumption.\n\n               Here, in appeals with unpreserved claims of Booker error,\n\nwe have been presented with such errors.1\n\n                     3. Presumed prejudice in other contexts\n\n               Courts have presumed prejudice for errors that, by their\n\nvery       nature,    make    a   demonstration      of   prejudice    exceptionally\n\ndifficult.           The     Sixth   Circuit   has    presumed   prejudice     where\n\nalternate jurors actually participated in the jury's deliberations\n\n(unlike Olano, where they were merely present).                       See Manning v.\n\nHuffman, 269 F.3d 720, 726 (6th Cir. 2001) (\"[T]he Olano court made\n\nit quite clear that in some situations a presumption of prejudice\n\nis appropriate.\").                After all, there are \"strict evidentiary\n\nprohibitions against inquiring into the mental processes of the\n\n\n       1\n       I do not consider this approach foreclosed by Justice\nBreyer's closing words commending to the courts of appeal \"ordinary\nprudential doctrines,\" like plain error. Booker, 125 S. Ct. at\n769. Olano discussed presumption of prejudice in the context of\nplain-error review.\n\n                                          -18-\n\fjury [that] would make it almost impossible for a defendant to show\n\nthat an alternate juror in fact prejudiced his case.\"                 Id. at 725\n\nn.2.      In    Booker   cases,   defendants     face    similarly    forbidding\n\nspeculation about the mental processes of a district-court judge if\n\ngiven the opportunity to apply advisory sentencing guidelines.\n\n               Courts have presumed prejudice where the defendant has\n\nbeen denied his right to allocution, that is, his opportunity to\n\npresent    mitigating      circumstances    to    the     court   before   being\n\nsentenced.       In those cases, too, courts have presumed that the\n\ndefendant was prejudiced because of the extraordinary difficulty in\n\ndiscerning the error's prejudicial effect.               See United States v.\n\nReyna, 358 F.3d 344, 352-53 (5th Cir. 2004) (en banc), cert.\n\ndenied, 124 S. Ct. 2390 (2004).        The Fifth Circuit noted that this\n\napproach \"avoids speculation as to what the defendant might have\n\nsaid or argued to mitigate his sentence.\"               Id. at 352.    In United\n\nStates v. Adams, 252 F.3d 276 (3d Cir. 2001), the Third Circuit\n\nstated that showing prejudice\n\n       would be an onerous burden for Adams [i.e., the\n       defendant] to meet. In order to prove that the error\n       actually \"affected the outcome of the district court\n       proceedings,\" Adams would have to point to statements\n       that he would have made at sentencing, and somehow show\n       that these statements would have changed the sentence\n       imposed by the District Court. . . . But as the Supreme\n       Court explained in Olano, there may be some errors \"that\n       should be presumed prejudicial if the defendant cannot\n       make a specific showing of prejudice.\" Olano, 507 U.S. at\n       735. Thus the question for us becomes: should we presume\n       prejudice when a district court violates a defendant's\n       right of allocution?\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\f252 F.3d at 287.        The Third Circuit's answer was yes.2               In United\n\nStates v. Alba Pagan, 33 F.3d 125 (1st Cir. 1994), although we did\n\nnot    explicitly     use   Olano's      four-part      test,     we   observed    that\n\nrelieving     a     defendant    of    his    burden    to   show      prejudice    can\n\ncompensate for cases where it would be extraordinarily difficult\n\nfor the defendant to do so.            Consequently, we wrote that the denial\n\nof    right   to    allocution       \"ordinarily   requires        vacation   of    the\n\nsentence imposed without a concomitant inquiry into prejudice.\n\nThis is so precisely because the impact of the omission on a\n\ndiscretionary        decision     is     usually     enormously        difficult     to\n\nascertain.\"        Id. at 130.\n\n                   4. Other reasons for presuming prejudice\n\n              In    addition    to    the    difficulty      of   reconstructing      a\n\nhypothetical        sentencing-court        decision,    there     are   three    other\n\nreasons that make the presumption of prejudice a sensible choice\n\nfor addressing unpreserved Booker error.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n       The Third Circuit has also presumed prejudice after a\nconstructive amendment of the indictment:\n\n       Similar to the plight of a defendant who is denied the\n       right of allocution, it is very difficult for a defendant\n       to prove prejudice resulting from most constructive\n       amendments to an indictment. . . . Therefore, we will\n       apply in the plain error context a rebuttable presumption\n       that constructive amendments are prejudicial (and thus\n       that they satisfy the third prong of plain error review).\n\nUnited States v. Syme, 276 F.3d 131, 154 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n                                         -20-\n\f              a. Difficulty of anticipating the error\n\n              Although some defendants preserved their claims of Booker\n\nerror in the way described in Antonakopoulos,3 others did not.\n\nPerhaps they can be faulted for not doing what other defendants\n\ndid.       Yet the fact remains that the status of the Guidelines was\n\nuncertain until Booker was decided, and the adoption of the remedy\n\nchosen in Booker for the Sixth Amendment violation (converting the\n\nGuidelines from mandatory to advisory) surprised many in the legal\n\nprofession.        Placing      the   burden    on   defendants   to      establish\n\nprejudice for unpreserved errors ordinarily makes sense because\n\nthey ignored existing law that they could have invoked to avoid the\n\nerror.      As the Supreme Court has explained, the \"burden should not\n\nbe too easy\" because the prejudice standard helps \"to encourage\n\ntimely      objections   and    reduce    wasteful    reversals      by   demanding\n\nstrenuous exertion to get relief for unpreserved error.\"                     United\n\nStates v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. __, 124 S. Ct. 2333, 2340\n\n(2004).\n\n              Here, however, the “existing” law (the availability of\n\nadvisory guidelines) is an artifice of our rule that \"a new rule\n\nfor    the    conduct    of    criminal   prosecutions     is   to    be    applied\n\nretroactively to all cases . . . pending on direct review . . .,\n\n\n\n       3\n       \"The argument that a Booker error occurred is preserved if\nthe defendant below argued Apprendi or Blakely error or that the\nGuidelines were unconstitutional.\" Antonakopoulos, 2005 WL 407365,\nat *6.\n\n                                         -21-\n\fwith no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a\n\n'clear break' with the past.\"         Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314,\n\n328 (1987); see also Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 467\n\n(1997).   In actuality, a demand by defendants pre-Booker that\n\ndistrict-court judges treat the guidelines as advisory would have\n\nbeen rejected by most of them as an incorrect statement of the law.\n\nFrankly, \"it seems unfair to fault [the defendant] for failing to\n\nraise at [sentencing] an objection based upon a rule that was not\n\nannounced until after the [sentencing] was concluded.\"                       United\n\nStates v. Barone, 114 F.3d 1284, 1294 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing\n\nUnited States v. Collins, 60 F.3d 4, 7 (1st Cir. 1995)).\n\n           Perhaps defendants should be grateful that our rule of\n\nretroactivity     for   cases    pending      on   direct     review   allows   any\n\npossibility at all for resentencing.               But the fact remains that a\n\ngreater willingness to acknowledge the likelihood of prejudice from\n\na   dramatic   change    in     the   law   like     Booker    does    not   reward\n\n\"sandbaggers\" who hoard their objections to hedge against a result\n\nnot to their liking.      There was no game-playing with a rule of law\n\nnot yet known.4\n\n\n      4\n       The Second Circuit has relied on an intervening change in\nlaw to justify shifting the prejudice burden from the defendant to\nthe government: \"In this Circuit, when the error results from an\nintervening change in the law, we have applied a modified version\nof the plain error doctrine whereby the burden is on the Government\nto show that the error did not affect substantial rights.\" United\nStates v. Williams , No. 04-2882, 2005 WL 425212, at *5 n.7 (2d\nCir. Feb. 4, 2005); see also United States v. Viola, 35 F.3d 37,\n41-42 (2d Cir. 1994), abrogated on other grounds by Salinas v.\n\n                                       -22-\n\f             b. Adminstrative burden\n\n          The      administrative    burdens      of   increased    remands     for\n\nsentencing    (a   likely   result   of     the   presumption      of   prejudice\n\napproach), while not insubstantial, would certainly be manageable,\n\ngiven the limited universe of cases at issue and the relatively low\n\ncost of correcting errors in sentencing.               For example, the Second\n\nCircuit estimated that, when Booker was decided, it had about 200\n\ncases pending      on   direct   review   with     sentences    that    might   be\n\nerroneous under the Supreme Court's new teaching:\n\n     Many of these will likely be remanded . . . . Some of\n     the remands will likely result in resentencing. We do\n     not regard that prospect as an undue burden on the proper\n     functioning of the criminal justice system in the federal\n     courts of this Circuit. On the contrary, we consider it\n     far preferable to leaving some materially erroneous\n\n\nUnited States, 522 U.S. 52 (1997). At the same time, the Second\nCircuit has wondered whether that so-called \"modified version\" has\nbeen implicitly rejected by Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461\n(1997). See Williams, 2005 WL 425212, at *5 n.7; United States v.\nThomas, 274 F.3d 655, 688 n. 15 (2d Cir. 2001) (en banc).\n     Although I respect the Second Circuit's prudence, I find its\nspeculation puzzling. In Johnson, the district court had decided\nfor itself the issue of materiality in a perjury persecution,\ninstead of submitting it to the jury. After Johnson was convicted,\nand before her appeal, the Supreme Court decided United States v.\nGaudin, 515 U.S. 506 (1995), which required materiality to be\nsubmitted to the jury. The Supreme Court held that an appellate\ncourt can correct an error that was not plain at trial, but became\nso on appeal.    Johnson confined its discussion of prejudice to\naddressing petitioner's theory that her error should be considered\nstructural error and hence outside the ambit of Rule 52(b)\naltogether. The Court was dubious. Ultimately, the Court did not\nneed to decide the issue because her case failed anyway at the\nfourth step of the plain-error analysis because of the overwhelming\nevidence of materiality. Johnson, 520 U.S. at 470. The issue of\npresumed prejudice--whether justified by a change in law or by\nother reasons--was simply not before the Court.\n\n                                     -23-\n\f       sentences in place simply because we cannot guess what\n       sentencing judges would have done.\n\nUnited States v. Williams, No. 04-2882, 2005 WL 425212, at *8 (2d\n\nCir. Feb. 4, 2005).         These cases are a closed set.      As soon as the\n\nSupreme Court issued its opinion in Booker, district courts knew to\n\nstop    sentencing     defendants    under    mandatory   guidelines,    thus\n\nensuring that no more cases will be tainted with Booker error.\n\n              Besides the simple numbers involved, we must consider\n\nthat resentencing in cases still pending on direct review does not\n\nundermine the judicial system's high stakes in finality.                   By\n\ndefinition, the cases we address here are not final.                Moreover,\n\nresentencing does not pose the burden of a new trial, with its\n\nconsiderable costs in time, money, and other resources.                As the\n\nSecond Circuit observed in Williams, \"the cost of correcting a\n\nsentencing error is far less than the cost of a retrial.                    A\n\nresentencing is a brief event, normally taking less than a day and\n\nrequiring the attendance of only the defendant, counsel, and court\n\npersonnel.\"      Williams, 2005 WL 425212, at *8.            Given what is at\n\nstake in sentencing decisions--the potential for additional months\n\nor     even    years   in     prison--I     believe   that    the   increased\n\nadministrative burdens are a tolerable price to pay.\n\n              c. Possibility of rebuttal\n\n              A presumption of prejudice still permits rebuttal by the\n\ngovernment, as Barnett acknowledges.             2005 WL 357015, at *12.\n\nThus, there would be no automatic remands, whether based on the\n\n                                     -24-\n\fpresence of judge-found facts and the use of mandatory guidelines\n\nor on the simple fact that mandatory guidelines were used as the\n\nbasis for sentencing after a jury’s findings or a defendant’s\n\nadmissions.      Similarly, this approach also avoids treating Booker\n\nerror as a structural error that \"undermin[es] the fairness of a\n\ncriminal proceeding as a whole.\"          Dominguez Benitez, 124 S. Ct. at\n\n2339; see also Olano, 507 U.S. at 735; Arizona v. Fulminante, 499\n\nU.S. 279, 309-10 (1991) (providing examples of structural error).\n\nAs in cases of preserved error that we review for harmlessness, the\n\ngovernment will be able to argue the absence of prejudice based on\n\nthe entirety of the existing record.\n\n            Indeed,    this    case    provides    an    apt   example   of   that\n\nprospect.    Here, Serrano faced a statutory mandatory minimum of 60\n\nmonths' imprisonment.         After taking into account his role in the\n\noffense and his criminal history, the guidelines required (now,\n\nadvise) a sentence within the range of 63 to 78 months, leaving\n\nlittle room for modification between the mandatory minimum of the\n\nstatute and the guidelines minimum. The judge sentenced Serrano to\n\n63 months.       Even now, the district court \"must consult those\n\nGuidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\"                  Booker,\n\n125 S. Ct. at 767.     The court could have sentenced him below the 63\n\nmonths of the guidelines only by totally ignoring the sentencing\n\nfactors   that    it   is   still     required    to    consider.    Thus,     the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fgovernment could show that Serrano was not harmed by the mandatory\n\nnature of the guidelines.\n\n                            5. Conclusion\n\n          Applying a presumption of prejudice in cases of Booker\n\nerror would not be an innovation. As Barnett explains, the concept\n\nis well grounded in Olano and other circuit decisions in a variety\n\nof contexts.   Hence, this approach remains faithful to Booker's\n\ndirective to the appellate courts to review unpreserved claims for\n\nplain error; it avoids automatic remands; and it responds fairly to\n\nthe unique problems left in Booker's wake.\n\n\n\n\n                                -26-\n\f",

The conspiracy is described in <i>United States v. Flecha-Maldonado,</i> 373 F.3d 170, 172-74 (1st Cir.2004), upholding the conviction of one of Serrano's and Juma's co-conspirators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In brief, Serrano, a former police officer who had been expelled from the force, helped to recruit Juma, a police officer at the time, to provide armed escort for a shipment of ten kilograms of cocaine in October, 2000. Juma rode with the drugs and carried a pistol. Serrano rode in another car and conducted counter-surveillance and advised his codefendants through cell phones. They each received a $5000 payment for their services in the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each defendant pled guilty to charges of conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a) and 846 (Count One), and of carrying firearms (and aiding and abetting of same) in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 924(c)(1)(A)(i) and 2 (Count Three). Each defendant stipulated to being personally responsible for one kilogram of cocaine. In the plea agreements, each also agreed to certain sentencing enhancements and acknowledged that each did not qualify for safety-valve treatment under the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Serrano was sentenced to 63 months' imprisonment for Count One and a consecutive term of 60 months for Count Three.

Serrano and Juma both appeal their sentences, raising a variety of arguments, most of which were waived by their plea agreements. Serrano also raises a claim of plain error as to his sentence under <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2005). We reject this argument as well because Serrano has failed to carry his burden that there is a \"reasonable probability\" that he would be sentenced more leniently under an advisory Guidelines system. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Serrano's Appeal</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Guilty Plea To Count Three</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Serrano argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred procedurally in accepting his guilty plea to Count Three. His argument is that the district court failed to \"explore the factual basis of the guilty plea\" as required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3), which states: \"Before entering judgment on a guilty plea, the court must determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.\" Serrano argues that had the district court done so, it would have found that there was no factual basis for Serrano's guilty plea because Serrano only admitted to providing \"armed transport\" for the drug shipment, but not to having possessed a firearm. The admission that he was \"armed\" was insufficient, he now argues, because it might have meant that he was \"armed with a big stick.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a Rule 11 challenge raised for the first time on appeal only for plain error. <i>United States v. Vonn,</i> 535 U.S. 55, 74-76, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002); <i>United States v. Cheal,</i> 389 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also United States v. Mills,</i> 329 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir.2003) (\"An error not objected to at the plea hearing is reversible only where the error is plain, affects the defendant's substantial rights, and seriously affects the fairness of the proceeding.\"). As to the underlying issue of compliance with the Rule, \"[o]n a plea, the question under Rule 11(f) [now Rule 11(b)(3)] is not whether a jury would, or even would be likely, to convict: it is whether there is enough evidence so that the plea has a rational basis in facts that the defendant concedes or that the government proffers as supported by credible evidence.\" <i>United States v. Gandia-Maysonet,</i> 227 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2000). In this case, there was no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Serrano's argument mischaracterizes his plea colloquy by ignoring the aiding and abetting and in furtherance of the conspiracy aspects of the charge against him in Count Three. The district court's Rule 11 colloquy focused on those aspects of the charge. It is irrelevant whether there were facts to show that Serrano was personally armed with a gun or a big stick. During the Rule 11 colloquy, Serrano specifically agreed that in \"aiding and abetting each other a <i>gun</i> was possessed in furtherance of the conspiracy\" (emphasis added). Furthermore, Serrano's counsel explained that Serrano understood that although he \"did not carry <i>the firearm</i>\" (emphasis added), he was responsible for the firearm(s) carried by his codefendant(s) under <i>Pinkerton v. United States,</i> 328 U.S. 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946). Rule 11(b)(3) is meant to \"protect a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge but without realizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the charge.\" <i>McCarthy v. United States,</i> 394 U.S. 459, 467, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969) (footnote and internal quotation marks omitted). The district judge ascertained that Serrano understood that he could be held liable for the firearms charge without having carried the gun himself and that Serrano was aware of the gun Juma possessed as part of the \"armed escort\" they provided for the drug shipment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Sentence for Count One</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Serrano brings a trio of challenges to his sentence as to Count One,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and argues that we should remand to the district court for resentencing in light of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2005). First, he challenges the evidentiary support for his criminal record and his organizer role sentencing enhancement; second, he argues that the district court was constrained by the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines and so sentenced him to above the statutory minimum; third, he argues that he should have been given the benefit of the safety valve. We take up each challenge in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">i. We begin with Serrano's argument that there was no factual support for either the finding 1) that Serrano's role during the offense was that of an \"organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor,\" justifying an increase in his offense level by two levels, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c), or 2) that Serrano's criminal history placed him in criminal history category II.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> If the district court erred in making these findings and, as a result, misapplied sentencing enhancements under the Guidelines so as to cause prejudice to Serrano's sentence, the errors would justify remand for resentencing even under pre-<i>Booker</i> circuit precedent. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Thiongo,</i> 344 F.3d 55, 63 (1st Cir.2003); <i>United States v. McMinn,</i> 103 F.3d 216, 219 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Serrano has waived his challenge to his organizer role enhancement. The plea agreement stipulated that Serrano \"helped [another codefendant] contact and recruit a police officer to assist in the escort of the cocaine shipment.\" The plea agreement also included the stipulation that Serrano's offense level would be adjusted upwards by two levels under &#167; 3B1.1 because he \"recruited one of his co-defendants.\" The district judge ascertained that Serrano understood and agreed to this adjustment. At sentencing, Serrano made no objection to the finding that he recruited a codefendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Serrano's criminal history, \"[o]nce the government establishes the existence of a prior conviction, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the earlier conviction was constitutionally infirm or otherwise inappropriate for consideration.\" <i>United States v. Barbour,</i> 393 F.3d 82, 93 (1st Cir.2004). At Serrano's detention hearing, his counsel stipulated to a criminal conviction in Humacao for violating Puerto Rico weapons laws. Serrano's pre-sentencing report (PSR), \"which can be used to satisfy the government's `modest' burden,\" <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Gray,</i> 177 F.3d 86, 89 (1st Cir.1999)), detailed Serrano's prior conviction in commonwealth court in Humacao for violating Puerto Rico weapons laws and calculated his criminal history score to be 3. Serrano made no objection to his criminal history score in the PSR at his sentencing hearing. Serrano conceded that \"the probation officer has to follow what convictions [Serrano] has in the police of Puerto Rico records.\" In fact, the only \"correction\" that Serrano's counsel wished to make to the PSR was to \"reference... the actual number of the criminal case in Humacao,\" and the court agreed. Serrano admitted to this conviction at the sentencing hearing, but suggested as a \"mitigating argument\" that he had a \"solid alibi defense.\" The district court properly rejected this argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii. Serrano next argues that his sentence on Count One should be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing because the district court was clearly constrained by the Guidelines during sentencing and imposed the 63-month term, which was above the statutory minimum of 60 months, and was at the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range. Post <i>Booker,</i> Serrano argues, the district court could have (and would have) sentenced him to the statutory minimum of 60 months. Serrano made no arguments in the district court questioning the constitutionality of the Guidelines or the application of the Guidelines to his sentence under <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), so the <i>Booker</i> issue was not preserved. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recently set forth the applicable framework for review of unpreserved <i>Booker</i> claims in <i>Antonakopoulos.</i> Utilizing the four-prong test in <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), there must be (1) an error (2) that is plain, and it (3) affects substantial rights and (4) seriously impairs the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 74. The first two prongs of the plain error test are met whenever the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory at the time of sentencing. <i>Id.</i> But to meet the third prong of the test, the defendant must persuade us that there is a \"reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new `advisory Guidelines' <i>Booker</i> regime.\" <i>Id.</i>\"[I]t is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice under plain-error analysis.\" <i>Id.</i> at 77 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Serrano relies upon the district judge's statement at the sentencing hearing: \"I have to consider the fact that I cannot sentence him to 60 months. The lowest I can sentence him on that particular situation is 63.\" This statement, he argues, makes it \"clear that the district court would have sentenced [Serrano] to 60 months in prison instead of 63 on count one.\" Not so. Given Serrano's criminal history category and his role as recruiter, and the amount of drugs involved, the court's statement was a simple statement of fact. The statutory minimum, without the enhancements, was 60 months. He was sentenced to 63 months, out of a possible range of 63 to 78 months. Serrano's argument amounts to an assertion that there was such a reasonable probability that the judge would have totally ignored Serrano's role in the offense and prior conviction and that our confidence in the outcome is undermined by the fact that the judge actually considered these two enhancements. Even post-<i>Booker,</i> the district court \"must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\" <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S. at ___, 125 S.Ct. at 767. And so the court had to consider both role in the offense and his criminal history. Serrano has failed to meet his burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iii. Serrano's final argument in his sentencing appeal is that the district court committed error in denying him the benefit of the provisions of the safety valve under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2. The argument, raised for the first time on appeal, is that but for the court's findings that Serrano had more than one criminal history point and that Serrano was an organizer of the criminal activity, he would have qualified for safety-valve treatment and thus be entitled to sentencing without regard to any statutory minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The effect of <i>Booker,</i> if any, on the safety valve has not been determined. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 76 n. 6. But Serrano's argument is waived because Serrano explicitly agreed in his plea agreement that he did not qualify for safety-valve treatment, and confirmed that he understood that he did not qualify for the safety valve during his change of plea hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Juma's Appeal of His Sentence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Juma first argues that the district court erred by equating his carrying of his official police pistol during the crime with disqualification from his entitlement to a downward departure under the safety valve. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2D1.1(b)(7), 5C1.2. He argues that but for the finding that he carried his pistol during and in connection with the crime, he would have qualified for safety-valve treatment and be sentenced below the statutory minimum. Although he stipulated to having \"carried a pistol\" during the escort in his plea agreement, Juma contends that the district court erred by not considering that he may nonetheless qualify for the safety valve because the firearm was not clearly connected to the offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See United States v. Bolka,</i> 355 F.3d 909, 914 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is waived because Juma explicitly agreed in his plea agreement that he did not qualify for safety-valve treatment, and confirmed that he understood that he did not qualify for the safety valve during his change of plea hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Juma's second argument is that a jury, not a judge, should have made the factual determinations underlying his disqualification for the safety valve and the abuse of public trust enhancement. By pleading guilty he waived consideration of the issues by a jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Serrano's conviction and both defendants' sentences are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Rule 11(b)(3) resulted from the recodification of its predecessor, Rule 11(f), in December of 2002<i>See United States v.

The base offense level and the enhancement calculations were all made a part of the plea agreement signed by the defendant.

I agree that we should not remand cases automatically, either because a defendant's sentence was enhanced on the basis of judge-found facts or because the sentence was imposed on the basis of mandatory guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My one disagreement with <i>Antonakopoulos</i> is crucial, however. I do not believe that we should require defendants invoking unpreserved <i>Booker</i> error to make a <i>specific</i> showing of prejudice (the reasonable probability of a different outcome) to satisfy the third step of plain-error review. Rather, such error should entitle the defendant to a presumption of prejudice, which the government can then try to rebut. This approach, adopted by a panel of the Sixth Circuit in <i>United States v. Barnett,</i> 398 F.3d 516 (6th Cir.2005), is well grounded in Supreme Court precedent and has been applied by our sister circuits in other contexts \"where the inherent nature of the error made it exceptionally difficult for the defendant to demonstrate that the outcome of the lower court proceeding would have been different had the error not occurred.\" <i>Id.</i> at 526-27. I wish to explain further my reasons for preferring this approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The difficulty of reconstructing a hypothetical sentencing decision</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several courts of appeals considering unpreserved claims of <i>Booker</i> error have emphasized the difficulty of speculating about what a district-court judge would have done differently under an advisory guidelines regime. The Fourth Circuit admitted that: \"We simply do not know how the district court would have sentenced Hughes had it been operating under the regime established by <i>Booker.</i>\" <i>United States v. Hughes,</i> 396 F.3d 374, 381 n. 8 (4th Cir.2005). Similarly, the Sixth Circuit wrote that \"even if we conclude that the evidence is `overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted' we cannot know the length of imprisonment that the district court judge would have imposed pursuant to this evidence following <i>Booker.</i>\" <i>United States v. Oliver,</i> 397 F.3d 369, 380 n. 3 (6th Cir.2005) (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Cotton,</i> 535 U.S. 625, 633, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002)). The Eleventh Circuit, too, after wondering what the district court might have done differently, answered its own question:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The obvious answer is that we don't know. If the district court judge in this case had the liberty of increasing or decreasing Rodriguez's sentence above or below the guidelines range, he might have given Rodriguez a longer sentence, or he might have given a shorter sentence, or he might have given the same sentence. The record provides no reason to believe any result is more likely than the other. We just don't know.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 398 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the Second Circuit found this problem so vexing that it chose to ask the district courts directly whether, in their judgment, \"a nontrivially different sentence would have been imposed\" under advisory guidelines. <i>United States v. Crosby,</i> 397 F.3d 103, 118 (2d Cir.2005). The Second Circuit noted that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">in many cases, it will be impossible to tell whether the judge would have imposed the same sentence had the judge not felt compelled to impose a Guidelines sentence. It will also be impossible to tell what considerations counsel for both sides might have brought to the sentencing judge's attention had they known that they could urge the judge to impose a non-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 115. The court chose to solve the problem by remanding any case with unpreserved <i>Booker</i> error to the district courts, which would then decide if resentencing was required. Although I do not favor the Second Circuit's remand approach, I understand the concerns that motivated it. So, too, did a panel of the Sixth Circuit in the <i>Barnett</i> decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">2. <i>Barnett</i> and presumed prejudice in <i>Olano</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Barnett,</i> the court emphasized the difficulty faced by defendants trying to demonstrate the prejudice that resulted from the district court's application of mandatory guidelines, when \"well established case law substantially undermined any need or incentive for sentencing courts pre-<i>Booker</i> to note their objections and reservations in sentencing defendants under the then-mandatory Guidelines.\" 398 F.3d at 529. Consequently,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[i]t would be improper for this Court now to require defendants such as Barnett to produce this type of evidence &#8212; that sentencing courts had no reason to provide under our pre-<i>Booker</i> case law &#8212; in order to establish that their substantial rights have been affected.... Instead of speculating as to the district court's intentions in the pre-<i>Booker</i> world, and trying to apply those intentions to predict the same court's sentence under the post-<i>Booker</i> scheme, we are convinced that the most prudent course of action in this case is to presume prejudice....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Barnett</i> reads <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), as suggesting that if a defendant would have extraordinary difficulty making a specific showing of prejudice, then a presumption of prejudice may be appropriate. <i>Barnett,</i> 398 F.3d at 526. The government, of course, can try to rebut that presumption. <i>Id.</i> at 529. The dissent in <i>Barnett</i> maintains, however, that \"the Supreme Court has never put its imprimatur on the idea that we may presume prejudice in plain error review,\" <i>id.</i> at 536. It supported that assertion by observing that <i>Olano</i> devotes just a sentence to the issue and then refused to consider it further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is not a fair reading of <i>Olano.</i> After first positing a category of plain errors entitled to a presumption of prejudice, the Court found no reason to place the specific plain error cited by the defendant (the presence of alternate jurors during jury deliberations) in that category. 507 U.S. at 735, 113 S.Ct. 1770. True, the Court declined to offer a strict definition of the category, seeing no need to \"address those errors that should be presumed prejudicial if the defendant cannot make a specific showing of prejudice.\" <i>Id.</i> Later, however, the Court did confront the question of whether Olano's error would belong to such a category, if it exists; it decided that \"we see no reason to presume prejudice here.\" <i>Id.</i> at 737, 113 S.Ct. 1770. At the same time, the Court allowed that \"[t]here may be cases where an intrusion should be presumed prejudicial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 739, 113 S.Ct. 1770. In fact, the Court framed the basic inquiry of its decision as: \"The question, then, is whether the instant violation of Rule 24(c) prejudiced respondents, either specifically <i>or presumptively.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). Ultimately, the Court did not think \"that the mere presence of alternate jurors entailed a sufficient risk of `chill' to justify a presumption of prejudice on that score.\" <i>Id.</i> at 741, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Nevertheless, its analysis forthrightly explored the possibility that some kinds of errors would justify such a presumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, in appeals with unpreserved claims of <i>Booker</i> error, we have been presented with such errors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Presumed prejudice in other contexts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have presumed prejudice for errors that, by their very nature, make a demonstration of prejudice exceptionally difficult. The Sixth Circuit has presumed prejudice where alternate jurors actually participated in the jury's deliberations (unlike <i>Olano,</i> where they were merely present). <i>See Manning v. Huffman,</i> 269 F.3d 720, 726 (6th Cir.2001) (\"[T]he <i>Olano</i> court made it quite clear that in some situations a presumption of prejudice is appropriate.\"). After all, there are \"strict evidentiary prohibitions against inquiring into the mental processes of the jury [that] would make it almost impossible for a defendant to show that an alternate juror in fact prejudiced his case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 725 n. 2. In <i>Booker</i> cases, defendants face similarly forbidding speculation about the mental processes of a district-court judge if given the opportunity to apply advisory sentencing guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have presumed prejudice where the defendant has been denied his right to allocution, that is, his opportunity to present mitigating circumstances to the court before being sentenced. In those cases, too, courts have presumed that the defendant was prejudiced because of the extraordinary difficulty in discerning the error's prejudicial effect. <i>See United States v. Reyna,</i> 358 F.3d 344, 352-53 (5th Cir.2004) (<i>en banc</i>), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2390, 158 L.Ed.2d 966 (2004). The Fifth Circuit noted that this approach \"avoids speculation as to what the defendant might have said or argued to mitigate his sentence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 352. In <i>United States v. Adams,</i> 252 F.3d 276 (3d Cir.2001), the Third Circuit stated that showing prejudice</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">would be an onerous burden for Adams [i.e., the defendant] to meet. In order to prove that the error actually \"affected the outcome of the district court proceedings,\" Adams would have to point to statements that he would have made at sentencing, and somehow show that these statements would have changed the sentence imposed by the District Court.... But as the Supreme Court explained in <i>Olano,</i> there may be some errors \"that should be presumed prejudicial if the defendant cannot make a specific showing of prejudice.\" <i>Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 735, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Thus the question for us becomes: should we presume prejudice when a district court violates a defendant's right of allocution?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">252 F.3d at 287. The Third Circuit's answer was yes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> In <i>United States v. De Alba Pagan,</i> 33 F.3d 125 (1st Cir.1994), although we did not explicitly use <i>Olano's</i> four-part test, we observed that relieving a defendant of his burden to show prejudice can compensate for cases where it would be extraordinarily difficult for the defendant to do so. Consequently, we wrote that the denial of right to allocution \"ordinarily requires vacation of the sentence imposed without a concomitant inquiry into prejudice. This is so precisely because the impact of the omission on a discretionary decision is usually enormously difficult to ascertain.\" <i>Id.</i> at 130.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4. Other reasons for presuming prejudice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the difficulty of reconstructing a hypothetical sentencing-court decision, there are three other reasons that make the presumption of prejudice a sensible choice for addressing unpreserved <i>Booker</i> error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. <i>Difficulty of anticipating the error</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although some defendants preserved their claims of Booker error in the way described in <i>Antonakopoulos,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a> others did not. Perhaps they can be faulted for not doing what other defendants did. Yet the fact remains that the status of the Guidelines was uncertain until <i>Booker</i> was decided, and the adoption of the remedy chosen in <i>Booker</i> for the Sixth Amendment violation (converting the Guidelines from mandatory to advisory) surprised many in the legal profession. Placing the burden on defendants to establish prejudice for unpreserved errors ordinarily makes sense because they ignored existing law that they could have invoked to avoid the error. As the Supreme Court has explained, the \"burden should not be too easy\" because the prejudice standard helps \"to encourage timely objections and reduce wasteful reversals by demanding strenuous exertion to get relief for unpreserved error.\" <i>United States v. Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 2340, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the \"existing\" law (the availability of advisory guidelines) is an artifice of our rule that \"a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases ... pending on direct review ..., with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a `clear break' with the past.\" <i>Griffith v. Kentucky,</i> 479 U.S. 314, 328, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987); <i>see also Johnson v. United States,</i> 520 U.S. 461, 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997). In actuality, a demand by defendants pre-<i>Booker</i> that district-court judges treat the guidelines as advisory would have been rejected by most of them as an incorrect statement of the law. Frankly, \"it seems unfair to fault [the defendant] for failing to raise at [sentencing] an objection based upon a rule that was not announced until after the [sentencing] was concluded.\" <i>United States v. Barone,</i> 114 F.3d 1284, 1294 (1st Cir.1997) (citing <i>United States v. Collins,</i> 60 F.3d 4, 7 (1st Cir.1995)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps defendants should be grateful that our rule of retroactivity for cases pending on direct review allows any possibility at all for resentencing. But the fact remains that a greater willingness to acknowledge the likelihood of prejudice from a dramatic change in the law like <i>Booker</i> does not reward \"sandbaggers\" who hoard their objections to hedge against a result not to their liking. There was no game-playing with a rule of law not yet known.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. <i>Administrative burden</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The administrative burdens of increased remands for sentencing (a likely result of the presumption of prejudice approach), while not insubstantial, would certainly be manageable, given the limited universe of cases at issue and the relatively low cost of correcting errors in sentencing. For example, the Second Circuit estimated that, when <i>Booker</i> was decided, it had about 200 cases pending on direct review with sentences that might be erroneous under the Supreme Court's new teaching:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Many of these will likely be remanded.... Some of the remands will likely result in resentencing. We do not regard that prospect as an undue burden on the proper functioning of the criminal justice system in the federal courts of this Circuit. On the contrary, we consider it far preferable to leaving some materially erroneous sentences in place simply because we cannot guess what sentencing judges would have done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Williams,</i> 399 F.3d 450, 461, 2005 WL 425212, at *8 (2d Cir.2005). These cases are a closed set. As soon as the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <i>Booker,</i> district courts knew to stop sentencing defendants under mandatory guidelines, thus ensuring that no more cases will be tainted with <i>Booker</i> error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides the simple numbers involved, we must consider that resentencing in cases still pending on direct review does not undermine the judicial system's high stakes in finality. By definition, the cases we address here are not final. Moreover, resentencing does not pose the burden of a new trial, with its considerable costs in time, money, and other resources. As the Second Circuit observed in <i>Williams,</i>\"the cost of correcting a sentencing error is far less than the cost of a retrial. A resentencing is a brief event, normally taking less than a day and requiring the attendance of only the defendant, counsel, and court personnel.\" <i>Williams,</i> 399 F.3d at 461, 2005 WL 425212, at *8. Given what is at stake in sentencing decisions &#8212; the potential for additional months or even years in prison &#8212; I believe that the increased administrative burdens are a tolerable price to pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. <i>Possibility of rebuttal</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A presumption of prejudice still permits rebuttal by the government, as <i>Barnett</i> acknowledges. 398 F.3d at 529. Thus, there would be no automatic remands, whether based on the presence of judge-found facts and the use of mandatory guidelines or on the simple fact that mandatory guidelines were used as the basis for sentencing after a jury's findings or a defendant's admissions. Similarly, this approach also avoids treating <i>Booker</i> error as a structural error that \"undermin[es] the fairness of a criminal proceeding as a whole.\" <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2339; <i>see also Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 735, 113 S.Ct. 1770; <i>Arizona v. Fulminante,</i> 499 U.S. 279, 309-10, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991) (providing examples of structural error). As in cases of preserved error that we review for harmlessness, the government will be able to argue the absence of prejudice based on the entirety of the existing record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, this case provides an apt example of that prospect. Here, Serrano faced a statutory mandatory minimum of 60 months' imprisonment. After taking into account his role in the offense and his criminal history, the guidelines required (now, advise) a sentence within the range of 63 to 78 months, leaving little room for modification between the mandatory minimum of the statute and the guidelines minimum. The judge sentenced Serrano to 63 months. Even now, the district court \"must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\" <i>Booker,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 767. The court could have sentenced him below the 63 months of the guidelines only by totally ignoring the sentencing factors that it is still required to consider. Thus, the government could show that Serrano was not harmed by the mandatory nature of the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>5. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying a presumption of prejudice in cases of <i>Booker</i> error would not be an innovation. As <i>Barnett</i> explains, the concept is well grounded in <i>Olano</i> and other circuit decisions in a variety of contexts. Hence, this approach remains faithful to <i>Booker's</i> directive to the appellate courts to review unpreserved claims for plain error; it avoids automatic remands; and it responds fairly to the unique problems left in <i>Booker's</i> wake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> I do not consider this approach foreclosed by Justice Breyer's closing words commending to the courts of appeal \"ordinary prudential doctrines,\" like plain error<i>Booker,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 769. <i>Olano</i> discussed presumption of prejudice in the context of plain-error review.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Third Circuit has also presumed prejudice after a constructive amendment of the indictment:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Similar to the plight of a defendant who is denied the right of allocution, it is very difficult for a defendant to prove prejudice resulting from most constructive amendments to an indictment.... Therefore, we will apply in the plain error context a rebuttable presumption that constructive amendments are prejudicial (and thus that they satisfy the third prong of plain error review).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

Williams,</i> 399 F.3d 450, 458 n. 7, 2005 WL 425212, at *5 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005); <i>see also United States v. Viola,</i> 35 F.3d 37, 41-42 (2d Cir.1994), <i>abrogated on other grounds by Salinas v. United States,</i> 522 U.S. 52, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997). At the same time, the Second Circuit has wondered whether that so-called \"modified version\" has been implicitly rejected by <i>Johnson v. United States,</i> 520 U.S. 461, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997). <i>See Williams,</i> 399 F.3d at 458 n. 7; <i>United States v. Thomas,</i> 274 F.3d 655, 668 n. 15 (2d Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Although I respect the Second Circuit's prudence, I find its speculation puzzling. In <i>Johnson,</i> the district court had decided for itself the issue of materiality in a perjury persecution, instead of submitting it to the jury. After Johnson was convicted, and before her appeal, the Supreme Court decided <i>United States v. Gaudin,</i> 515 U.S. 506, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995), which required materiality to be submitted to the jury. The Supreme Court held that an appellate court can correct an error that was not plain at trial, but became so on appeal. <i>Johnson</i> confined its discussion of prejudice to addressing petitioner's theory that her error should be considered structural error and hence outside the ambit of Rule 52(b) altogether. The Court was dubious. Ultimately, the Court did not need to decide the issue because her case failed anyway at the fourth step of the plain-error analysis because of the overwhelming evidence of materiality. <i>Johnson,</i> 520 U.S. at 470, 117 S.Ct. 1544. The issue of presumed prejudice &#8212; whether justified by a change in law or by other reasons &#8212; was simply not before the Court.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The district court's Rule 11 colloquy focused on those aspects of the charge. It is irrelevant whether there were facts to show that Serrano was personally armed with a gun or a big stick. During the Rule 11 colloquy, Serrano specifically agreed that in \"aiding and abetting each other a <i>gun</i> was possessed in furtherance of the conspiracy\" (emphasis added). Furthermore, Serrano's counsel explained that Serrano understood that although he \"did not carry <i>the firearm</i>\" (emphasis added), he was responsible for the firearm(s) carried by his codefendant(s) under <i>Pinkerton v.

First, he challenges the evidentiary support for his criminal record and his organizer role sentencing enhancement; second, he argues that the district court was constrained by the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines and so sentenced him to above the statutory minimum; third, he argues that he should have been given the benefit of the safety valve. We take up each challenge in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">i. We begin with Serrano's argument that there was no factual support for either the finding 1) that Serrano's role during the offense was that of an \"organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor,\" justifying an increase in his offense level by two levels, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c), or 2) that Serrano's criminal history placed him in criminal history category II.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> If the district court erred in making these findings and, as a result, misapplied sentencing enhancements under the Guidelines so as to cause prejudice to Serrano's sentence, the errors would justify remand for resentencing even under pre-<i>Booker</i> circuit precedent. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Thiongo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200648\"><a href=\"/opinion/200648/united-states-v-thiongo/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 63 (1st Cir.2003); <i>United States v.

The plea agreement stipulated that Serrano \"helped [another codefendant] contact and recruit a police officer to assist in the escort of the cocaine shipment.\" The plea agreement also included the stipulation that Serrano's offense level would be adjusted upwards by two levels under &#167; 3B1.1 because he \"recruited one of his co-defendants.\" The district judge ascertained that Serrano understood and agreed to this adjustment. At sentencing, Serrano made no objection to the finding that he recruited a codefendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Serrano's criminal history, \"[o]nce the government establishes the existence of a prior conviction, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the earlier conviction was constitutionally infirm or otherwise inappropriate for consideration.\" <i>United States v. Barbour,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201393\"><a href=\"/opinion/201393/united-states-v-barbour/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 93 (1st Cir.2004). At Serrano's detention hearing, his counsel stipulated to a criminal conviction in Humacao for violating Puerto Rico weapons laws. Serrano's pre-sentencing report (PSR), \"which can be used to satisfy the government's `modest' burden,\" <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Gray,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198495\"><a href=\"/opinion/198495/united-states-v-gray/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 89 (1st Cir.1999)), detailed Serrano's prior conviction in commonwealth court in Humacao for violating Puerto Rico weapons laws and calculated his criminal history score to be 3. Serrano made no objection to his criminal history score in the PSR at his sentencing hearing. Serrano conceded that \"the probation officer has to follow what convictions [Serrano] has in the police of Puerto Rico records.\" In fact, the only \"correction\" that Serrano's counsel wished to make to the PSR was to \"reference... the actual number of the criminal case in Humacao,\" and the court agreed. Serrano admitted to this conviction at the sentencing hearing, but suggested as a \"mitigating argument\" that he had a \"solid alibi defense.\" The district court properly rejected this argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii. Serrano next argues that his sentence on Count One should be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing because the district court was clearly constrained by the Guidelines during sentencing and imposed the 63-month term, which was above the statutory minimum of 60 months, and was at the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range. Post <i>Booker,</i> Serrano argues, the district court could have (and would have) sentenced him to the statutory minimum of 60 months. Serrano made no arguments in the district court questioning the constitutionality of the Guidelines or the application of the Guidelines to his sentence under <i>Apprendi v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (1993), there must be (1) an error (2) that is plain, and it (3) affects substantial rights and (4) seriously impairs the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 74. The first two prongs of the plain error test are met whenever the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory at the time of sentencing. <i>Id.</i> But to meet the third prong of the test, the defendant must persuade us that there is a \"reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new `advisory Guidelines' <i>Booker</i> regime.\" <i>Id.</i>\"[I]t is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice under plain-error analysis.\" <i>Id.</i> at 77 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Serrano relies upon the district judge's statement at the sentencing hearing: \"I have to consider the fact that I cannot sentence him to 60 months. The lowest I can sentence him on that particular situation is 63.\" This statement, he argues, makes it \"clear that the district court would have sentenced [Serrano] to 60 months in prison instead of 63 on count one.\" Not so. Given Serrano's criminal history category and his role as recruiter, and the amount of drugs involved, the court's statement was a simple statement of fact. The statutory minimum, without the enhancements, was 60 months. He was sentenced to 63 months, out of a possible range of 63 to 78 months. Serrano's argument amounts to an assertion that there was such a reasonable probability that the judge would have totally ignored Serrano's role in the offense and prior conviction and that our confidence in the outcome is undermined by the fact that the judge actually considered these two enhancements. Even post-<i>Booker,</i> the district court \"must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\" <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S. at ___, 125 S.Ct. at 767. And so the court had to consider both role in the offense and his criminal history. Serrano has failed to meet his burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iii. Serrano's final argument in his sentencing appeal is that the district court committed error in denying him the benefit of the provisions of the safety valve under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2. The argument, raised for the first time on appeal, is that but for the court's findings that Serrano had more than one criminal history point and that Serrano was an organizer of the criminal activity, he would have qualified for safety-valve treatment and thus be entitled to sentencing without regard to any statutory minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The effect of <i>Booker,</i> if any, on the safety valve has not been determined. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 76 n. 6. But Serrano's argument is waived because Serrano explicitly agreed in his plea agreement that he did not qualify for safety-valve treatment, and confirmed that he understood that he did not qualify for the safety valve during his change of plea hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Juma's Appeal of His Sentence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Juma first argues that the district court erred by equating his carrying of his official police pistol during the crime with disqualification from his entitlement to a downward departure under the safety valve. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2D1.1(b)(7), 5C1.2. He argues that but for the finding that he carried his pistol during and in connection with the crime, he would have qualified for safety-valve treatment and be sentenced below the statutory minimum. Although he stipulated to having \"carried a pistol\" during the escort in his plea agreement, Juma contends that the district court erred by not considering that he may nonetheless qualify for the safety valve because the firearm was not clearly connected to the offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See United States v.

The base offense level and the enhancement calculations were all made a part of the plea agreement signed by the defendant.

I do not believe that we should require defendants invoking unpreserved <i>Booker</i> error to make a <i>specific</i> showing of prejudice (the reasonable probability of a different outcome) to satisfy the third step of plain-error review. Rather, such error should entitle the defendant to a presumption of prejudice, which the government can then try to rebut.

The court chose to solve the problem by remanding any case with unpreserved <i>Booker</i> error to the district courts, which would then decide if resentencing was required.

The government, of course, can try to rebut that presumption. <i>Id.</i> at 529. The dissent in <i>Barnett</i> maintains, however, that \"the Supreme Court has never put its imprimatur on the idea that we may presume prejudice in plain error review,\" <i>id.</i> at 536.

True, the Court declined to offer a strict definition of the category, seeing no need to \"address those errors that should be presumed prejudicial if the defendant cannot make a specific showing of prejudice.\" <i>Id.</i> Later, however, the Court did confront the question of whether Olano's error would belong to such a category, if it exists; it decided that \"we see no reason to presume prejudice here.\" <i>Id.</i> at 737, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

At the same time, the Court allowed that \"[t]here may be cases where an intrusion should be presumed prejudicial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 739, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In fact, the Court framed the basic inquiry of its decision as: \"The question, then, is whether the instant violation of Rule 24(c) prejudiced respondents, either specifically <i>or presumptively.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). Ultimately, the Court did not think \"that the mere presence of alternate jurors entailed a sufficient risk of `chill' to justify a presumption of prejudice on that score.\" <i>Id.</i> at 741, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Presumed prejudice in other contexts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have presumed prejudice for errors that, by their very nature, make a demonstration of prejudice exceptionally difficult. The Sixth Circuit has presumed prejudice where alternate jurors actually participated in the jury's deliberations (unlike <i>Olano,</i> where they were merely present). <i>See Manning v.

After all, there are \"strict evidentiary prohibitions against inquiring into the mental processes of the jury [that] would make it almost impossible for a defendant to show that an alternate juror in fact prejudiced his case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 725 n. 2. In <i>Booker</i> cases, defendants face similarly forbidding speculation about the mental processes of a district-court judge if given the opportunity to apply advisory sentencing guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have presumed prejudice where the defendant has been denied his right to allocution, that is, his opportunity to present mitigating circumstances to the court before being sentenced. In those cases, too, courts have presumed that the defendant was prejudiced because of the extraordinary difficulty in discerning the error's prejudicial effect. <i>See United States v.

In order to prove that the error actually \"affected the outcome of the district court proceedings,\" Adams would have to point to statements that he would have made at sentencing, and somehow show that these statements would have changed the sentence imposed by the District Court.... But as the Supreme Court explained in <i>Olano,</i> there may be some errors \"that should be presumed prejudicial if the defendant cannot make a specific showing of prejudice.\" <i>Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 735, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Consequently, we wrote that the denial of right to allocution \"ordinarily requires vacation of the sentence imposed without a concomitant inquiry into prejudice.

Perhaps they can be faulted for not doing what other defendants did. Yet the fact remains that the status of the Guidelines was uncertain until <i>Booker</i> was decided, and the adoption of the remedy chosen in <i>Booker</i> for the Sixth Amendment violation (converting the Guidelines from mandatory to advisory) surprised many in the legal profession. Placing the burden on defendants to establish prejudice for unpreserved errors ordinarily makes sense because they ignored existing law that they could have invoked to avoid the error. As the Supreme Court has explained, the \"burden should not be too easy\" because the prejudice standard helps \"to encourage timely objections and reduce wasteful reversals by demanding strenuous exertion to get relief for unpreserved error.\" <i>United States v.

But the fact remains that a greater willingness to acknowledge the likelihood of prejudice from a dramatic change in the law like <i>Booker</i> does not reward \"sandbaggers\" who hoard their objections to hedge against a result not to their liking. There was no game-playing with a rule of law not yet known.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. <i>Administrative burden</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The administrative burdens of increased remands for sentencing (a likely result of the presumption of prejudice approach), while not insubstantial, would certainly be manageable, given the limited universe of cases at issue and the relatively low cost of correcting errors in sentencing. For example, the Second Circuit estimated that, when <i>Booker</i> was decided, it had about 200 cases pending on direct review with sentences that might be erroneous under the Supreme Court's new teaching:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Many of these will likely be remanded.... Some of the remands will likely result in resentencing. We do not regard that prospect as an undue burden on the proper functioning of the criminal justice system in the federal courts of this Circuit. On the contrary, we consider it far preferable to leaving some materially erroneous sentences in place simply because we cannot guess what sentencing judges would have done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789374\"><a href=\"/opinion/789374/united-states-v-bernard-b-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span>, 461, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">425212</span></span>, at *8 (2d Cir.2005). These cases are a closed set. As soon as the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <i>Booker,</i> district courts knew to stop sentencing defendants under mandatory guidelines, thus ensuring that no more cases will be tainted with <i>Booker</i> error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides the simple numbers involved, we must consider that resentencing in cases still pending on direct review does not undermine the judicial system's high stakes in finality. By definition, the cases we address here are not final. Moreover, resentencing does not pose the burden of a new trial, with its considerable costs in time, money, and other resources. As the Second Circuit observed in <i>Williams,</i>\"the cost of correcting a sentencing error is far less than the cost of a retrial. A resentencing is a brief event, normally taking less than a day and requiring the attendance of only the defendant, counsel, and court personnel.\" <i>Williams,</i> 399 F.3d at 461, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">425212</span></span>, at *8. Given what is at stake in sentencing decisions &#8212; the potential for additional months or even years in prison &#8212; I believe that the increased administrative burdens are a tolerable price to pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. <i>Possibility of rebuttal</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A presumption of prejudice still permits rebuttal by the government, as <i>Barnett</i> acknowledges. 398 F.3d at 529. Thus, there would be no automatic remands, whether based on the presence of judge-found facts and the use of mandatory guidelines or on the simple fact that mandatory guidelines were used as the basis for sentencing after a jury's findings or a defendant's admissions. Similarly, this approach also avoids treating <i>Booker</i> error as a structural error that \"undermin[es] the fairness of a criminal proceeding as a whole.\" <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2339; <i>see also Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 735, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As in cases of preserved error that we review for harmlessness, the government will be able to argue the absence of prejudice based on the entirety of the existing record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, this case provides an apt example of that prospect. Here, Serrano faced a statutory mandatory minimum of 60 months' imprisonment. After taking into account his role in the offense and his criminal history, the guidelines required (now, advise) a sentence within the range of 63 to 78 months, leaving little room for modification between the mandatory minimum of the statute and the guidelines minimum. The judge sentenced Serrano to 63 months. Even now, the district court \"must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\" <i>Booker,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 767. The court could have sentenced him below the 63 months of the guidelines only by totally ignoring the sentencing factors that it is still required to consider. Thus, the government could show that Serrano was not harmed by the mandatory nature of the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>5. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying a presumption of prejudice in cases of <i>Booker</i> error would not be an innovation. As <i>Barnett</i> explains, the concept is well grounded in <i>Olano</i> and other circuit decisions in a variety of contexts. Hence, this approach remains faithful to <i>Booker's</i> directive to the appellate courts to review unpreserved claims for plain error; it avoids automatic remands; and it responds fairly to the unique problems left in <i>Booker's</i> wake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> I do not consider this approach foreclosed by Justice Breyer's closing words commending to the courts of appeal \"ordinary prudential doctrines,\" like plain error<i>Booker,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 769. <i>Olano</i> discussed presumption of prejudice in the context of plain-error review.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Third Circuit has also presumed prejudice after a constructive amendment of the indictment:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Similar to the plight of a defendant who is denied the right of allocution, it is very difficult for a defendant to prove prejudice resulting from most constructive amendments to an indictment.... Therefore, we will apply in the plain error context a rebuttable presumption that constructive amendments are prejudicial (and thus that they satisfy the third prong of plain error review).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

In <i>Johnson,</i> the district court had decided for itself the issue of materiality in a perjury persecution, instead of submitting it to the jury. After Johnson was convicted, and before her appeal, the Supreme Court decided <i>United States v. Gaudin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117958\"><a href=\"/opinion/117958/united-states-v-gaudin/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117958\"><a href=\"/opinion/117958/united-states-v-gaudin/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span> (1995), which required materiality to be submitted to the jury. The Supreme Court held that an appellate court can correct an error that was not plain at trial, but became so on appeal. <i>Johnson</i> confined its discussion of prejudice to addressing petitioner's theory that her error should be considered structural error and hence outside the ambit of Rule 52(b) altogether. The Court was dubious. Ultimately, the Court did not need to decide the issue because her case failed anyway at the fourth step of the plain-error analysis because of the overwhelming evidence of materiality. <i>Johnson,</i> 520 U.S. at 470, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118106\"><a href=\"/opinion/118106/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
