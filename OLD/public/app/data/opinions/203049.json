This is an appeal from the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of a case for forum non conveniens.\n\nPlaintiff     Sheldon   Adelson,   a    United       States     citizen,      is   an\n\ninternational businessman with substantial holdings around the\n\nworld, including several casinos and a corporation named Interface\n\nPartners    International,      Ltd.    (\"IPI\").         IPI    is   a     Delaware\n\ncorporation    which    was   established      for   the   purpose       of    making\n\nbusiness    investments    in   Israel,      and   has   offices     in    Needham,\n\nMassachusetts, Nevada, and Israel.           The defendant, Moshe Hananel,\n\nis a citizen and resident of Israel who was hired in 1995 to serve\n\nas the General Manager of IPI's operations in Israel.                         Adelson\n\nterminated Hananel's employment with IPI in April 2000, resulting\n\nin several lawsuits in an Israeli labor court.                 In February 2004,\n\nAdelson filed the instant suit in the United States District Court\n\nfor the District of Massachusetts seeking a declaration of the\n\nparties' respective rights pursuant to an oral employment contract\n\nbetween IPI and Hananel.\n\n            After finding that it had personal jurisdiction over the\n\ndefendant for the declaratory action, the district court dismissed\n\nthe case for forum non conveniens.                 The court determined that\n\nIsrael is an adequate alternative forum and that the balancing of\n\npublic and private interest factors weighs in favor of the Israeli\n\nforum.   Adelson v. Hananel, No. 04-10357 (D. Mass. July 18, 2006)\n\n(order dismissing the case on grounds of forum non conveniens).\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fThe plaintiff now appeals, arguing, inter alia, that the district\n\ncourt failed to afford heightened deference to the plaintiff, a\n\nU.S. citizen, and his choice of forum, and erred in relying on the\n\npendency of concurrent action in Israel.                 The defendant cross-\n\nappeals    and   contends    that      the   district   court      lacks   personal\n\njurisdiction over him.       We affirm the district court's finding of\n\npersonal jurisdiction, but reverse the dismissal for forum non\n\nconveniens.\n\n                                  I.   Background\n\n            Adelson and Hananel enjoyed a social friendship prior to\n\ntheir decision to become involved in business together.                     In late\n\n2005, Hananel became aware that IPI's General Manager in Israel\n\nwould be vacating that position and he expressed interest in the\n\njob.      According   to    the    facts     alleged    in   the   complaint,    on\n\nDecember 5, 1995, Adelson, Hananel, and IPI's General Counsel, Paul\n\nRoberts, met in IPI's office in Needham and formally agreed that\n\nHananel would become a full-time employee of IPI.1                         Hananel's\n\nresponsibilities were to identify, recruit, and hire business\n\nanalysts and portfolio managers who would help IPI search out and\n\nidentify opportunities in Israel in the high technology sector.\n\nHis agreed salary was $100,000 and twelve percent of the net\n\nprofits realized by IPI from any high tech investments which were\n\n\n1\n   Although the exact date on which they agreed that Hananel would\nbegin his employment with IPI is in dispute, he became a full-time\nemployee by January 1, 1996.\n\n                                         -3-\n\ffound, recommended, and made as a result of his efforts.           Although\n\nthe parties confirmed and finalized the terms of employment and all\n\nthree men shook hands, nothing was ever set in writing.2\n\n             In the course of Hananel's employment, he and Adelson\n\nstayed in constant communication via daily telephone calls to\n\ndiscuss IPI business.        Although it is unclear whether Adelson was\n\nin Massachusetts during those phone calls, it is undisputed that\n\nthe substance of the conversations was IPI-related.            Hananel was\n\nalso in frequent contact with other IPI officers, such as Chief\n\nFinancial Officer Stephen O'Connor and IPI's Treasurer, who were\n\nbased in Needham.        The Needham office also managed all of the\n\nbudgeting and funding for the Israel branch; Hananel submitted his\n\nannual budget to and made all requests for operating funds through\n\nthat office because the funds were held in Massachusetts bank\n\naccounts.    Various    written    communications    between   Hananel    and\n\nO'Connor confirm that reporting structure.\n\n             On at least one occasion, Hananel went to Massachusetts\n\nto attend a meeting on behalf of an Israeli company, iMD Soft,\n\nLtd.,   in    which    IPI   had   a   substantial   investment.     As     a\n\nrepresentative of IPI, Hananel was a member of iMD's Board of\n\n\n\n\n2\n   According to an affidavit submitted by Roberts, he offered to\nprepare a written contract memorializing the terms of the\nemployment contract, but Hananel replied that it was unnecessary\nbecause of his personal relationship with Adelson.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fDirectors and participated in a meeting with officers from Agilent\n\nTechnologies in Andover, Massachusetts.\n\n            Hananel's      employment      was    terminated     in   April    2000,\n\nallegedly for malfeasance.           Adelson claims that Hananel did little\n\nto no work for IPI and used IPI's finances and personnel for his\n\nown personal and business purposes.              In 2001, Hananel sued Adelson\n\nand IPI in Tel Aviv District Labor Court for compensation which he\n\nalleges he was owed under his oral employment contract.                    Adelson\n\ncountersued   in    the    Israeli     court,    seeking   the    return      of   the\n\nallegedly misused IPI funds. In February 2002, as the parties were\n\nnegotiating the severance terms, Hananel demanded twelve percent of\n\nAdelson's shares in a new multi-billion dollar real estate, casino,\n\nresort hotel, and convention project in Macau, China.                      Hananel\n\nclaimed that he had facilitated the venture and, pursuant to his\n\nemployment contract, was entitled to a percentage of the shares.\n\nDenied his request, Hananel filed a second suit in the Tel Aviv\n\nDistrict Labor Court alleging that he was entitled to twelve\n\npercent of the stock option shares.                  The Israeli court soon\n\nthereafter consolidated the two cases.\n\n            Adelson filed the instant complaint in federal court on\n\nFebruary    23,    2004,    seeking    a   declaratory     judgment     regarding\n\nHananel's   alleged       interest    in   the    Macau   business,    injunctive\n\nrelief, and damages.        The complaint alleges that Hananel harassed\n\nand threatened Adelson and IPI, issuing defamatory claims in press\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\freleases in Chinese and American news media and threatening other\n\nparties involved in the business project.    Adelson contends that\n\nHananel's claims amount to extortion and that they are inhibiting\n\nhis ability to deal freely in his Macau business venture.3\n\n          Following jurisdictional discovery, Hananel filed renewed\n\nmotions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non\n\nconveniens.4   The district court referred the motions to the\n\nMagistrate Judge who recommended that the motion to dismiss for\n\nlack of personal jurisdiction be denied as to Count One for\n\ndeclaratory judgment, but granted as to the other three counts.\n\nThe Magistrate Judge also recommended that the motion to dismiss\n\nfor forum non conveniens be granted.        Rejecting the parties'\n\nvarious objections to the Magistrate Judge's report, the district\n\ncourt adopted and accepted both recommendations.       Adelson now\n\nappeals the dismissal for forum non conveniens, and Hananel cross-\n\nappeals the denial of his motion to dismiss, for lack of personal\n\njurisdiction, Count One of the complaint.\n\n\n3\n   During his deposition, Hananel asserted that he was entitled to\nshares of Adelson's other international investments, beyond the\ninterests in Macau. Adelson's suit in the District of Massachusetts\nrefers broadly to investments anywhere in the world, while the\nIsraeli suit is focused specifically on Macau.\n4\n   Hananel initially filed motions to dismiss for lack of personal\njurisdiction and forum non conveniens in June 2004.       After a\nhearing, the district court denied, without prejudice, the motion\nto dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and ordered that it could be\nrenewed after jurisdictional discovery.    The court also denied,\nwithout prejudice, the dismissal for forum non conveniens until it\ncould establish that it had jurisdiction over the defendant.\n\n                               -6-\n\f                                II.   Discussion\n\n           A.    Personal Jurisdiction\n\n           We first review the district court's denial of Hananel's\n\nmotion to dismiss Count One for lack of personal jurisdiction.5\n\nFaced with a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,\n\na   district    court   \"may   choose    from   among   several   methods   for\n\ndetermining whether the plaintiff has met [its] burden.\"              Daynard\n\nv. Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson & Poole, P.A., 290 F.3d 42,\n\n50-51 (1st Cir. 2002).         In this case, the district court employed\n\nthe most common method, the \"prima facie method\" or the \"prima\n\nfacie   evidentiary      standard,\"      rather    than    adjudicating     the\n\njurisdictional facts.      The district court found that the amount of\n\ndetailed and specific evidence provided by the plaintiff weighed in\n\nfavor of applying the prima facie standard.             Under this standard,\n\nthe court need only \"consider . . . whether the plaintiff has\n\nproffered evidence that, if credited, is enough to support findings\n\nof all facts essential to personal jurisdiction.\"             Foster-Miller,\n\nInc. v. Babcock & Wilcox Canada, 46 F.3d 138, 145 (1st Cir.\n\n1995)(quoting Boit v. Gar-Tec Products, Inc., 967 F.2d 671, 675\n\n(1st Cir. 1992)).\n\n           We review both the district court's decision to use the\n\nprima facie standard and its conclusion under that standard de\n\n\n\n5\n  Adelson neither objected to nor appeals the district court order\ndismissing Counts Two - Four for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n\n                                        -7-\n\fnovo.    Foster-Miller, 446 F.3d at 147; see also United States v.\n\nSwiss American Bank, Ltd., 274 F.3d 610, 619 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nHere, the parties do not object to the court's choice of method;\n\nthe defendant contends only that it was misapplied.\n\n              Applying the prima facie standard, Adelson bears the\n\nburden   of    establishing   that    the    district       court      has   personal\n\njurisdiction     over    Hananel.     We    \"must    accept      the    plaintiff's\n\n(properly documented) evidentiary proffers as true for the purpose\n\nof determining the adequacy of the prima facie jurisdictional\n\nshowing.\"     Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145.         In fact, we accept those\n\nfacts as true, irrespective of whether the defendant disputes them,\n\nand in so doing, \"construe them in the light most congenial to the\n\nplaintiff's jurisdictional claim.\"           Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover,\n\nInc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 34 (1st Cir. 1998).                         Those\n\nfacts put forward by the defendant become part of the mix only to\n\nthe extent that they are uncontradicted.             Id. at 34.\n\n              It is undisputed that Adelson is proceeding under a\n\ntheory   of    specific    (rather    than       general)      jurisdiction       and,\n\ntherefore, must demonstrate that the Massachusetts long-arm statute\n\ngrants jurisdiction over Hananel and that the exercise of that\n\njurisdiction comports with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\n\nAmendment.       See    Foster-Miller,      46    F.3d    at    144.      Under    the\n\nMassachusetts      statute,    \"[a]      court      may        exercise      personal\n\njurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an agent, as to\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fa cause of action in law or equity arising from the person's . . .\n\ntransacting any business in this commonwealth.\"           Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 223A, ¬ß 3(a)(2000).       In Massachusetts, the Court can \"sidestep\n\nthe statutory inquiry and proceed directly to the constitutional\n\nanalysis\" because the state's long-arm statute is coextensive with\n\nthe limits allowed by the Constitution.         Daynard, 290 F.3d at 52\n\n(citing \"Automatic\" Sprinkler Corp. of Am. v. Seneca Foods Corp.,\n\n361 Mass. 441 (1972)).\n\n           In   order   for     Massachusetts    to    exercise     personal\n\njurisdiction over Hananel, an out-of-state defendant, the Due\n\nProcess   Clause   requires    that   Hananel   have   sufficient   minimum\n\ncontacts with the state, such that \"maintenance of the suit does\n\nnot offend 'traditional notions of fair play and substantial\n\njustice.'\"   Int'l Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)\n\n(quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463 (1940)).                  For\n\nspecific jurisdiction, we have broken the minimum contacts analysis\n\ninto three categories -- relatedness, purposeful availment, and\n\nreasonableness:\n\n           First, the claim underlying the litigation\n           must directly arise out of, or relate to, the\n           defendant's forum-state activities.    Second,\n           the   defendant's   in-state   contacts   must\n           represent a purposeful availment of the\n           privilege of conducting activities in the\n           forum state, thereby invoking the benefits and\n           protections of that state's laws and making\n           the defendant's involuntary presence before\n           the state's courts foreseeable.     Third, the\n           exercise of jurisdiction must, in light of the\n           Gestalt factors, be reasonable.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fDaynard, 290 F.3d at 60 (quoting Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 144).\n\n                  1.   Relatedness\n\n          Generally, relatedness refers to the requirement that the\n\nunderlying claim \"arise out of\" or be \"related to\" the activities\n\nwithin the forum state.   The relatedness standard is a \"flexible,\n\nrelaxed standard,\" Pritzker v. Yari, 42 F.3d 53, 61 (1st Cir.\n\n1994), which focuses on the \"nexus between the defendant's contacts\n\nand the plaintiff's cause of action.\"   Ticketmaster-New York, Inc.\n\nv. Alioto, 26 F.3d 201, 206 (1st Cir. 1994).      Count One of the\n\ncomplaint seeks a judgment declaring the rights and obligations\n\nunder Hananel's oral employment contract.     We have held that in\n\ncontract claims, we may look to and draw inferences from \"the\n\nparties' prior negotiations and contemplated future consequences,\n\nalong with the terms of the contract and the parties' actual course\n\nof dealing.\"   Daynard, 390 F.3d at 52 (quoting Burger King Corp. v.\n\nRudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 479 (1985)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). Furthermore, where the cause of action is for an alleged\n\nbreach of contract, we ask whether the defendant's activity in the\n\nforum state was \"instrumental either in the formation of the\n\ncontract or its breach.\"     See Phillips Exeter Acad. v. Howard\n\nPhillips Fund, Inc., 196 F.3d 284, 289 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          At the heart of this declaratory action is a dispute\n\nregarding the specific terms of an oral employment contract; the\n\ndistrict court properly observed that \"[n]othing could be more\n\n\n                                -10-\n\finstrumental in the formation of a contract than the literal act of\n\nforming the contract itself.\"           The court first found that the\n\ncontract between the parties was \"formalized and entered into in\n\nMassachusetts\" and \"subjected Hananel to substantial control and\n\nongoing connection to Massachusetts in the performance of this\n\ncontract.\"      Hananel's appeal urges us to reject Adelson's version\n\nof the events which Adelson alleges transpired on December 5, 1995.\n\nHis arguments are unpersuasive; the law makes it clear that under\n\nthe prima facie standard, Adelson's evidence is accepted as true\n\nand all inferences are drawn in favor of his jurisdictional claim.\n\nSee Mass. Sch. of Law, 142 F.3d at 34.                 Affidavits from both\n\nAdelson and Roberts recount that the three men finalized the\n\nspecific   terms     of    employment   which     Adelson     and   Hananel     had\n\ninformally discussed prior to that meeting.                 The district court\n\nproperly found that the employment contract was formalized and\n\nentered    into     during    Hananel's     December     5,    1995      trip   to\n\nMassachusetts when he met with Adelson and Roberts.                 Accordingly,\n\nthe   instant     action   arises   from    and   is   related      to   Hananel's\n\nactivities within the forum.        See Phillips Exeter Acad., 196 F.3d\n\nat 289.\n\n                     2.    Purposeful Availment\n\n           Our next inquiry is whether Hananel's contacts with\n\nMassachusetts constitute purposeful availment.                This requirement\n\nensures that jurisdiction is not based on merely \"random, isolated\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\for fortuitous\" contacts with the forum state. Sawtelle v. Farrell,\n\n70 F.3d 1381, 1391 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting Keeton v. Hustler\n\nMagazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 774 (1984)).                         The two key focal\n\npoints of this concept are voluntariness and foreseeability.                         Id.,\n\n70 F.3d at 1391 (citing Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d at 207).                                The\n\ncontacts must be voluntary and not based on the unilateral actions\n\nof another party.             Burger King, 471 U.S. at 475.                   And, the\n\ndefendant's      contacts       must    be     such    that   he   could   \"reasonably\n\nanticipate being haled into court there.\"                      World-Wide Volkswagen\n\nCorp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297 (1980).\n\n            Here,       the    district        court    concluded     that    the     two\n\nrequirements were easily met. First, Hananel freely and of his own\n\nvolition expressed interest in and obtained employment with IPI and\n\nnegotiated and executed his own contract while in Massachusetts.\n\nSecond,    the    court       found     that    the     evidence    established      the\n\nforeseeability of litigation in Massachusetts: (1) his employment\n\nrelationship was formalized in Massachusetts with IPI's lawyer, (2)\n\nhis business card acknowledged his ongoing relationship with the\n\nstate,    and    (3)    all    of     his   budgets     and    financial   funds     were\n\nsubmitted to and obtained through IPI's Needham office.                      Moreover,\n\ngiven that it was Hananel who sought this employment contract with\n\na company whose key officers were all located in Massachusetts and\n\nwhose     financial          accounts       were      all     administered    out     of\n\nMassachusetts,         the    court    properly       concluded    that    Hananel    had\n\n\n                                             -12-\n\fpurposefully availed himself of Massachusetts law.                     See Burger\n\nKing, 471 U.S. at 473 (\"[P]arties who 'reach out beyond one state\n\nand create continuing relationships and obligations with citizens\n\nof another state' are subject to regulation and sanctions in the\n\nother State for the consequences of their activities.\" (quoting\n\nTravelers Health Ass'n v. Virginia, 339 U.S. 643, 647 (1950))).\n\n              On    appeal,   Hananel     challenges    the    district    court's\n\nfindings on both voluntariness and foreseeability.                     He contends\n\nthat he had traveled to Massachusetts in December 1995 for the\n\npurpose of seeking medical advice on his diabetic condition. While\n\nthat may be true, we do not see how it is relevant to the district\n\ncourt's findings of voluntariness and foreseeability. The district\n\ncourt   did    not     conclude   that    the    sole   purpose   of    coming   to\n\nMassachusetts had been to formalize the agreement; the court simply\n\nconcluded that on December 5, Hananel freely met with IPI and\n\nAdelson, and finalized his employment contract.                   Likewise, the\n\nforeseeability of litigation in Massachusetts was established upon\n\nmeeting with IPI and Adelson and agreeing to the terms of the\n\nemployment contract.          The original purpose of the Massachusetts\n\nvisit is inconsequential.           Hananel's independent and voluntary\n\nmeeting with Adelson and Roberts transformed the relevant portion\n\nof his visit into a business visit.\n\n              Furthermore, the district court properly found that the\n\nadditional         evidence   proffered     by   Adelson      demonstrated    that\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fHananel's     contacts      with    Massachusetts        continued     during      his\n\nemployment.        Although    he   oversaw     the     Israel   office,    Hananel\n\ncommunicated    regularly       with   members     of    IPI's    Needham    office\n\nregarding various financial matters.                  His annual budgets were\n\nsubmitted to the Needham office and all operational funds were\n\napproved and disbursed through the Needham office.                     It is clear\n\nthat the evidence reviewed by the district court supports a finding\n\nthat there existed sufficient ties between Massachusetts and the\n\nemployment contract.        Hananel knowingly affiliated himself with a\n\ncorporate     entity      which     was    based      primarily       in   Needham,\n\nMassachusetts and, thus, the possibility of a suit there was amply\n\nforeseeable.\n\n                     3.     Reasonableness\n\n            Even    after     concluding    that      minimum    contacts    exist,\n\npersonal    jurisdiction      may   only   be    exercised       if   it   would   be\n\nreasonable, pursuant to a series of factors known as the \"Gestalt\n\nfactors.\"    Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 144.              Those factors are:\n\n            (1) the defendant's burden of appearing, (2)\n            the forum state's interest in adjudicating the\n            dispute, (3) the plaintiff's interest in\n            obtaining convenient and effective relief, (4)\n            the judicial system's interest in obtaining\n            the   most   effective   resolution   of   the\n            controversy, and (5) the common interests of\n            all sovereigns in promoting substantive social\n            policies.\n\nUnited Elec., Radio and Mach. Workers of Am. v. 163 Pleasant St.\n\nCorp., 960 F.2d 1080, 1088 (1st Cir. 1992) (citing Burger King, 471\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fU.S. at 477).   The factors, intended to aid the court in achieving\n\nsubstantial justice, play a larger role in cases where the minimum\n\ncontacts question is very close.          See Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d at 210\n\n(\"[T]he weaker the plaintiff's showing on the first two prongs\n\n(relatedness and purposeful availment), the less a defendant need\n\nshow in terms of unreasonableness to defeat jurisdiction.\"); see\n\nalso Burger King, 471 U.S. at 477 (\"[W]here a defendant who\n\npurposefully has directed his activities at forum residents seeks\n\nto defeat jurisdiction, he must present a compelling case that the\n\npresence of some other consideration would render jurisdiction\n\nunreasonable.\").      The court below found that the Gestalt factors\n\nsupport the conclusion that jurisdiction is reasonable.           We agree.\n\n            Admittedly, Hananel lives and works in Israel and is a\n\nlegally blind diabetic.        While those facts evoke sympathy for the\n\nundeniable burden placed upon Hananel, the district court properly\n\nconcluded   that    no    \"special   or   unusual   burden\"   existed   here.\n\nPritzker, 42 F.3d at 64.        The court noted that neither his foreign\n\nresidence nor his medical condition precluded him from traveling\n\ninternationally in the course of his employment or from agreeing to\n\nwork for an American company.        Furthermore, Adelson, a resident of\n\nthe   state,    has      an   interest    in   bringing   this   action   in\n\nMassachusetts, which weighs in favor of a finding of personal\n\njurisdiction.      And, as we noted in an earlier case, Massachusetts\n\nhas a \"stake in being able to provide a convenient forum for its\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fresidents to redress injuries inflicted by out-of-forum actors.\"\n\nDaynard, 290 F.3d at 62 (quoting Sawtelle, 70 F.3d at 1395)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).              The state's interest in the\n\ncase is further heightened by the involvement of IPI's executive\n\nofficers who are employed in Massachusetts and of funds which are\n\nheld and managed in Massachusetts.              Although Hananel casts doubt\n\nupon   Adelson's    ability       to   claim    that   Massachusetts        is   more\n\nconvenient than Israel, he fails to recognize that this factor\n\nrequires deference to a plaintiff's choice of forum.                     See Foster-\n\nMiller, 46 F.3d at 151; see also Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d at 211\n\n(recognizing     that   a   plaintiff     must   be    accorded     \"a    degree   of\n\ndeference   in   respect     to   the   issue    of    its    own   convenience\").\n\nLastly, while the interests of the judicial system in achieving\n\nefficient resolution militate against Adelson because of the prior\n\nsuits pending in Israel, the district court properly concluded that\n\nthis factor alone was insufficient to tip the constitutional\n\nbalance on the facts of this case.\n\n            Accordingly,      Hananel's        contacts      with   Massachusetts\n\nconstitute \"minimum contacts\" in such a manner that it does not\n\n\"offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\"\n\nfor Adelson to bring this case in the state.                 Int'l Shoe, 326 U.S.\n\nat 316 (quoting Milliken, 311 U.S. at 463).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\f            B.   Forum Non Conveniens\n\n            Adelson appeals from the decision of the district court\n\nto dismiss the suit for forum non conveniens.             The decision to\n\ngrant or deny a motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens is\n\ngenerally committed to the district court's discretion.                    Piper\n\nAircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U.S. 235, 257 (1981).              We will find an\n\nabuse of discretion if the district court (1) failed to consider a\n\nmaterial factor; (2) substantially relied on an improper factor; or\n\n(3) assessed the proper factors, but clearly erred in weighing\n\nthem.    Iragorri v. Int'l Elevator, Inc., 203 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).    Errors of law, however, are reviewed de novo.           Id.\n\n            We begin with the well-known framework for forum non\n\nconveniens   outlined   by   the   Supreme   Court   in   a    pair   of   1947\n\nopinions,    Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, and Koster v.\n\nLumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U.S. 518.           Those cases and their\n\nprogeny established forum non conveniens as a discretionary tool\n\nfor the district court to dismiss a claim, even when it has proper\n\njurisdiction.    See Gilbert, 330 U.S. at 507.       That power, however,\n\nis limited by the overarching principle that a \"plaintiff's choice\n\nof forum should rarely be disturbed.\"        Id. at 508; see also Howe v.\n\nGoldcorp Invs., Ltd., 946 F.2d 944, 950 (1st Cir. 1991) (forum non\n\nconveniens is intended to \"avoid trials in places so 'inconvenient'\n\nthat transfer is needed to avoid serious unfairness\" (quoting Piper\n\nAircraft Co., 454 U.S. at 259)).          Accordingly, the party moving\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\ffor dismissal bears the heavy burden of establishing that an\n\nadequate alternative forum exists and that \"considerations of\n\nconvenience and judicial efficiency strongly favor litigating the\n\nclaim in the second forum.\"         Iragorri, 203 F.3d at 12 (emphasis\n\nadded).   Neither party disputes the availability and adequacy of\n\nthe Israeli forum.        The issue is whether the district court\n\nproperly balanced the factors in the second step of the analysis.\n\n           In this case, the district court found that the suit was\n\nnot vexatious and that no great equity weighed in the defendant's\n\nfavor.    Yet, because there was already a case pending before the\n\nIsraeli   court,   the   district   court   concluded   that   the   public\n\ninterest factors weighed in favor of dismissal. On appeal, Adelson\n\ncontends that the district court (1) improperly reversed the burden\n\nof proof, requiring the plaintiff to prove why he could not fairly\n\nlitigate his claim in Israel; (2) failed to give proper deference\n\nto a United States plaintiff's choice of forum; and (3) placed\n\nundue significance on the existence of concurrent litigation in the\n\nIsraeli court.     We agree with Adelson and reverse the district\n\ncourt's dismissal.\n\n           As a starting point, it is undisputed that a plaintiff\n\nenjoys some degree of deference for his original choice of forum.\n\nSee Gulf Oil, 330 U.S. at 508.         Added to that is the heightened\n\ndeference which accompanies a plaintiff's choice of home forum.\n\nSee Koster, 330 U.S. at 524 (holding that when the plaintiff has\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fchosen his home forum, he should not be deprived of it absent a\n\n\"clear showing\" of either \"oppressiveness and vexation\" or evidence\n\nthat the chosen forum is \"inappropriate\"). Although Adelson is not\n\na Massachusetts domiciliary, the Massachusetts district court is\n\nstill deemed a \"home forum\" where the alternative is foreign.           See\n\nReid-Walen v. Hansen, 933 F.2d 1390, 1394 (8th Cir. 1991) (in a\n\nforum non conveniens case involving a foreign court, \"the 'home'\n\nforum for the plaintiff is any federal district in the United\n\nStates, not the particular district where the plaintiff lives\").\n\nA logical extension of that heightened deference in favor of a\n\nplaintiff's \"home forum\" applies in cases such as this which\n\ninvolves a U.S. citizen plaintiff who is seeking to litigate in a\n\nUnited States forum.      While the Supreme Court held that dismissal\n\nis \"not automatically barred\" in such cases, Piper Aircraft Co.,\n\n454 U.S. at 256 n.23, a heavy presumption weighs in favor of that\n\nplaintiff's initial forum choice.\n\n          In the past, we have implicitly recognized the \"strong\n\npresumption    favoring   the   American   forum   selected   by   American\n\nplaintiffs.\"    Mercier v. Sheraton Int'l Inc., 981 F.2d 1345, 1355\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).    Other circuits have more explicitly articulated\n\nthe strength of this presumption when the plaintiffs are citizens,\n\nresidents, or corporations of this country.        See, e.g., SME Racks,\n\nInc. v. Sistemas Mec√°nicos Para Electr√≥nica, S.A., 382 F.3d 1097,\n\n1104 (11th Cir. 2004) (\"[T]here is a strong federal interest in\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fmaking   sure   that     plaintiffs     who   are    United   States   citizens\n\ngenerally get to choose an American forum for bringing suit, rather\n\nthan having their case relegated to a foreign jurisdiction.\"\n\n(quoting Esfeld v. Costa Crociere, S.P.A., 289 F.3d 1300, 1311\n\n(11th Cir. 2002)); Carey v. Bayerische Hypo-Und Vereinsbank AG, 370\n\nF.3d 234, 238 (2d Cir. 2004) (noting the \"presumptive validity of\n\na United States resident's choice of a United States forum\");\n\nRaytheon Eng'rs and Constructors, Inc. v. HLH and Assocs. Inc., No.\n\n97-20187,    1998   WL    224531   at    *2   (5th    Cir.    Apr.   17,   1998)\n\n(recognizing the presumption in favor of a plaintiff's choice of\n\nforum, \"especially when a United States plaintiff has chosen the\n\nhome forum\").\n\n            While the district court properly observed that Adelson\n\nis a United States citizen and that there is a \"heavy presumption\"\n\nin favor of his choice of forum, the district court ignored that\n\npresumption because of the existence of the concurrent action in\n\nthe Israeli court.       Indeed, in its analysis up to that point, the\n\ndistrict court had found that the \"private interest factors did not\n\nweigh in favor of either party\" and that the public interest was\n\n\"also in equipoise between the parties.\"             Moreover, the court also\n\nfound that Adelson's suit was neither vexatious nor oppressive.\n\nThus, it was the existence of concurrent litigation that not only\n\ncaused the balance to shift in favor of the foreign forum, but also\n\neviscerated the presumption in favor of the plaintiff's forum.                In\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fdiscussing the Israeli suit, the district court stated, \"I see no\n\nreason why Adelson cannot fairly litigate his claim in Israel.\"\n\nThe   district    court   erred   in   so     construing    the   importance   of\n\nconcurrent litigation within the forum non conveniens analysis.\n\n           Having found the public and private interest factors to\n\nbe in equipoise, the district court should have concluded that the\n\ndefendant failed to overcome the heavy presumption in favor of the\n\nplaintiff's home forum. It is the defendant who carries the burden\n\nof establishing that the \"compendium of factors relevant to the\n\nprivate and public interests implicated by the case strongly favors\n\ndismissal.\" Iragorri, 203 F.3d at 12 (emphasis added).                  Factors\n\nrelevant to the public interest analysis include:\n\n           administrative    difficulties    of    docket\n           congestion; the general goal of \"having\n           localized controversies decided at home,\" and\n           . . . ease of access to the proceedings on the\n           part of interested citizens, the trier's\n           relative familiarity with the appropriate\n           rules of decision, and the burdens of jury\n           duty.\n\nId. (quoting Gilbert, 330 U.S. at 508-509).                  The existence of\n\nconcurrent litigation is not a relevant factor to the analysis;\n\nnone of the factors enumerated above invokes a comparison between\n\nthe two competing fora.      By focusing on the existence of parallel\n\nproceedings in a foreign court, the district court essentially\n\nconverted the analysis into a determination of which of the two\n\npending   cases    should   go    forward.        In   so   doing,   the   court\n\nerroneously lowered the defendant's burden of proving that the\n\n                                       -21-\n\fbalance of factors justified dismissal of a suit from a U.S.\n\nplaintiff's choice of home forum.\n\n                           III.    Conclusion\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt   denying   the   motion    to   dismiss   for   lack   of   personal\n\njurisdiction is affirmed, and the judgment dismissing for forum non\n\nconveniens is reversed.\n\n           Affirmed in part; and Reversed in part.        Costs are taxed\n\nin favor of Sheldon G. Adelson.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\f",

This is an appeal from the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of a case for forum non conveniens.\n\nPlaintiff     Sheldon   Adelson,   a    United       States     citizen,      is   an\n\ninternational businessman with substantial holdings around the\n\nworld, including several casinos and a corporation named Interface\n\nPartners    International,      Ltd.    (\"IPI\").         IPI    is   a     Delaware\n\ncorporation    which    was   established      for   the   purpose       of    making\n\nbusiness    investments    in   Israel,      and   has   offices     in    Needham,\n\nMassachusetts, Nevada, and Israel.           The defendant, Moshe Hananel,\n\nis a citizen and resident of Israel who was hired in 1995 to serve\n\nas the General Manager of IPI's operations in Israel.                         Adelson\n\nterminated Hananel's employment with IPI in April 2000, resulting\n\nin several lawsuits in an Israeli labor court.                 In February 2004,\n\nAdelson filed the instant suit in the United States District Court\n\nfor the District of Massachusetts seeking a declaration of the\n\nparties' respective rights pursuant to an oral employment contract\n\nbetween IPI and Hananel.\n\n            After finding that it had personal jurisdiction over the\n\ndefendant for the declaratory action, the district court dismissed\n\nthe case for forum non conveniens.                 The court determined that\n\nIsrael is an adequate alternative forum and that the balancing of\n\npublic and private interest factors weighs in favor of the Israeli\n\nforum.   Adelson v. Hananel, No. 04-10357 (D. Mass.

The defendant cross-\n\nappeals    and   contends    that      the   district   court      lacks   personal\n\njurisdiction over him.       We affirm the district court's finding of\n\npersonal jurisdiction, but reverse the dismissal for forum non\n\nconveniens.\n\n                                  I.   Background\n\n            Adelson and Hananel enjoyed a social friendship prior to\n\ntheir decision to become involved in business together.                     In late\n\n2005, Hananel became aware that IPI's General Manager in Israel\n\nwould be vacating that position and he expressed interest in the\n\njob.      According   to    the    facts     alleged    in   the   complaint,    on\n\nDecember 5, 1995, Adelson, Hananel, and IPI's General Counsel, Paul\n\nRoberts, met in IPI's office in Needham and formally agreed that\n\nHananel would become a full-time employee of IPI.1                         Hananel's\n\nresponsibilities were to identify, recruit, and hire business\n\nanalysts and portfolio managers who would help IPI search out and\n\nidentify opportunities in Israel in the high technology sector.\n\nHis agreed salary was $100,000 and twelve percent of the net\n\nprofits realized by IPI from any high tech investments which were\n\n\n1\n   Although the exact date on which they agreed that Hananel would\nbegin his employment with IPI is in dispute, he became a full-time\nemployee by January 1, 1996.\n\n                                         -3-\n\ffound, recommended, and made as a result of his efforts.           Although\n\nthe parties confirmed and finalized the terms of employment and all\n\nthree men shook hands, nothing was ever set in writing.2\n\n             In the course of Hananel's employment, he and Adelson\n\nstayed in constant communication via daily telephone calls to\n\ndiscuss IPI business.        Although it is unclear whether Adelson was\n\nin Massachusetts during those phone calls, it is undisputed that\n\nthe substance of the conversations was IPI-related.            Hananel was\n\nalso in frequent contact with other IPI officers, such as Chief\n\nFinancial Officer Stephen O'Connor and IPI's Treasurer, who were\n\nbased in Needham.        The Needham office also managed all of the\n\nbudgeting and funding for the Israel branch; Hananel submitted his\n\nannual budget to and made all requests for operating funds through\n\nthat office because the funds were held in Massachusetts bank\n\naccounts.    Various    written    communications    between   Hananel    and\n\nO'Connor confirm that reporting structure.\n\n             On at least one occasion, Hananel went to Massachusetts\n\nto attend a meeting on behalf of an Israeli company, iMD Soft,\n\nLtd.,   in    which    IPI   had   a   substantial   investment.     As     a\n\nrepresentative of IPI, Hananel was a member of iMD's Board of\n\n\n\n\n2\n   According to an affidavit submitted by Roberts, he offered to\nprepare a written contract memorializing the terms of the\nemployment contract, but Hananel replied that it was unnecessary\nbecause of his personal relationship with Adelson.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fDirectors and participated in a meeting with officers from Agilent\n\nTechnologies in Andover, Massachusetts.\n\n            Hananel's      employment      was    terminated     in   April    2000,\n\nallegedly for malfeasance.           Adelson claims that Hananel did little\n\nto no work for IPI and used IPI's finances and personnel for his\n\nown personal and business purposes.              In 2001, Hananel sued Adelson\n\nand IPI in Tel Aviv District Labor Court for compensation which he\n\nalleges he was owed under his oral employment contract.                    Adelson\n\ncountersued   in    the    Israeli     court,    seeking   the    return      of   the\n\nallegedly misused IPI funds. In February 2002, as the parties were\n\nnegotiating the severance terms, Hananel demanded twelve percent of\n\nAdelson's shares in a new multi-billion dollar real estate, casino,\n\nresort hotel, and convention project in Macau, China.                      Hananel\n\nclaimed that he had facilitated the venture and, pursuant to his\n\nemployment contract, was entitled to a percentage of the shares.\n\nDenied his request, Hananel filed a second suit in the Tel Aviv\n\nDistrict Labor Court alleging that he was entitled to twelve\n\npercent of the stock option shares.                  The Israeli court soon\n\nthereafter consolidated the two cases.\n\n            Adelson filed the instant complaint in federal court on\n\nFebruary    23,    2004,    seeking    a   declaratory     judgment     regarding\n\nHananel's   alleged       interest    in   the    Macau   business,    injunctive\n\nrelief, and damages.        The complaint alleges that Hananel harassed\n\nand threatened Adelson and IPI, issuing defamatory claims in press\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\freleases in Chinese and American news media and threatening other\n\nparties involved in the business project.    Adelson contends that\n\nHananel's claims amount to extortion and that they are inhibiting\n\nhis ability to deal freely in his Macau business venture.3\n\n          Following jurisdictional discovery, Hananel filed renewed\n\nmotions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non\n\nconveniens.4   The district court referred the motions to the\n\nMagistrate Judge who recommended that the motion to dismiss for\n\nlack of personal jurisdiction be denied as to Count One for\n\ndeclaratory judgment, but granted as to the other three counts.\n\nThe Magistrate Judge also recommended that the motion to dismiss\n\nfor forum non conveniens be granted.        Rejecting the parties'\n\nvarious objections to the Magistrate Judge's report, the district\n\ncourt adopted and accepted both recommendations.       Adelson now\n\nappeals the dismissal for forum non conveniens, and Hananel cross-\n\nappeals the denial of his motion to dismiss, for lack of personal\n\njurisdiction, Count One of the complaint.\n\n\n3\n   During his deposition, Hananel asserted that he was entitled to\nshares of Adelson's other international investments, beyond the\ninterests in Macau. Adelson's suit in the District of Massachusetts\nrefers broadly to investments anywhere in the world, while the\nIsraeli suit is focused specifically on Macau.\n4\n   Hananel initially filed motions to dismiss for lack of personal\njurisdiction and forum non conveniens in June 2004.       After a\nhearing, the district court denied, without prejudice, the motion\nto dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and ordered that it could be\nrenewed after jurisdictional discovery.    The court also denied,\nwithout prejudice, the dismissal for forum non conveniens until it\ncould establish that it had jurisdiction over the defendant.\n\n                               -6-\n\f                                II.

The district\n\ncourt   did    not     conclude   that    the    sole   purpose   of    coming   to\n\nMassachusetts had been to formalize the agreement; the court simply\n\nconcluded that on December 5, Hananel freely met with IPI and\n\nAdelson, and finalized his employment contract.                   Likewise, the\n\nforeseeability of litigation in Massachusetts was established upon\n\nmeeting with IPI and Adelson and agreeing to the terms of the\n\nemployment contract.          The original purpose of the Massachusetts\n\nvisit is inconsequential.           Hananel's independent and voluntary\n\nmeeting with Adelson and Roberts transformed the relevant portion\n\nof his visit into a business visit.\n\n              Furthermore, the district court properly found that the\n\nadditional         evidence   proffered     by   Adelson      demonstrated    that\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fHananel's     contacts      with    Massachusetts        continued     during      his\n\nemployment.        Although    he   oversaw     the     Israel   office,    Hananel\n\ncommunicated    regularly       with   members     of    IPI's    Needham    office\n\nregarding various financial matters.                  His annual budgets were\n\nsubmitted to the Needham office and all operational funds were\n\napproved and disbursed through the Needham office.                     It is clear\n\nthat the evidence reviewed by the district court supports a finding\n\nthat there existed sufficient ties between Massachusetts and the\n\nemployment contract.        Hananel knowingly affiliated himself with a\n\ncorporate     entity      which     was    based      primarily       in   Needham,\n\nMassachusetts and, thus, the possibility of a suit there was amply\n\nforeseeable.\n\n                     3.     Reasonableness\n\n            Even    after     concluding    that      minimum    contacts    exist,\n\npersonal    jurisdiction      may   only   be    exercised       if   it   would   be\n\nreasonable, pursuant to a series of factors known as the \"Gestalt\n\nfactors.\"    Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 144.              Those factors are:\n\n            (1) the defendant's burden of appearing, (2)\n            the forum state's interest in adjudicating the\n            dispute, (3) the plaintiff's interest in\n            obtaining convenient and effective relief, (4)\n            the judicial system's interest in obtaining\n            the   most   effective   resolution   of   the\n            controversy, and (5) the common interests of\n            all sovereigns in promoting substantive social\n            policies.\n\nUnited Elec., Radio and Mach.

The factors, intended to aid the court in achieving\n\nsubstantial justice, play a larger role in cases where the minimum\n\ncontacts question is very close.          See Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d at 210\n\n(\"[T]he weaker the plaintiff's showing on the first two prongs\n\n(relatedness and purposeful availment), the less a defendant need\n\nshow in terms of unreasonableness to defeat jurisdiction.\"); see\n\nalso Burger King, 471 U.S. at 477 (\"[W]here a defendant who\n\npurposefully has directed his activities at forum residents seeks\n\nto defeat jurisdiction, he must present a compelling case that the\n\npresence of some other consideration would render jurisdiction\n\nunreasonable.\").      The court below found that the Gestalt factors\n\nsupport the conclusion that jurisdiction is reasonable.           We agree.\n\n            Admittedly, Hananel lives and works in Israel and is a\n\nlegally blind diabetic.        While those facts evoke sympathy for the\n\nundeniable burden placed upon Hananel, the district court properly\n\nconcluded   that    no    \"special   or   unusual   burden\"   existed   here.\n\nPritzker, 42 F.3d at 64.        The court noted that neither his foreign\n\nresidence nor his medical condition precluded him from traveling\n\ninternationally in the course of his employment or from agreeing to\n\nwork for an American company.        Furthermore, Adelson, a resident of\n\nthe   state,    has      an   interest    in   bringing   this   action   in\n\nMassachusetts, which weighs in favor of a finding of personal\n\njurisdiction.      And, as we noted in an earlier case, Massachusetts\n\nhas a \"stake in being able to provide a convenient forum for its\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fresidents to redress injuries inflicted by out-of-forum actors.\"\n\nDaynard, 290 F.3d at 62 (quoting Sawtelle, 70 F.3d at 1395)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).              The state's interest in the\n\ncase is further heightened by the involvement of IPI's executive\n\nofficers who are employed in Massachusetts and of funds which are\n\nheld and managed in Massachusetts.              Although Hananel casts doubt\n\nupon   Adelson's    ability       to   claim    that   Massachusetts        is   more\n\nconvenient than Israel, he fails to recognize that this factor\n\nrequires deference to a plaintiff's choice of forum.                     See Foster-\n\nMiller, 46 F.3d at 151; see also Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d at 211\n\n(recognizing     that   a   plaintiff     must   be    accorded     \"a    degree   of\n\ndeference   in   respect     to   the   issue    of    its    own   convenience\").\n\nLastly, while the interests of the judicial system in achieving\n\nefficient resolution militate against Adelson because of the prior\n\nsuits pending in Israel, the district court properly concluded that\n\nthis factor alone was insufficient to tip the constitutional\n\nbalance on the facts of this case.\n\n            Accordingly,      Hananel's        contacts      with   Massachusetts\n\nconstitute \"minimum contacts\" in such a manner that it does not\n\n\"offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\"\n\nfor Adelson to bring this case in the state.

Those cases and their\n\nprogeny established forum non conveniens as a discretionary tool\n\nfor the district court to dismiss a claim, even when it has proper\n\njurisdiction.    See Gilbert, 330 U.S. at 507.       That power, however,\n\nis limited by the overarching principle that a \"plaintiff's choice\n\nof forum should rarely be disturbed.\"        Id. at 508; see also Howe v.\n\nGoldcorp Invs., Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570021\"><a href=\"/opinion/570021/reginald-h-howe-v-goldcorp-investments-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 950 (1st Cir. 1991) (forum non\n\nconveniens is intended to \"avoid trials in places so 'inconvenient'\n\nthat transfer is needed to avoid serious unfairness\" (quoting Piper\n\nAircraft Co., 454 U.S. at 259)).          Accordingly, the party moving\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\ffor dismissal bears the heavy burden of establishing that an\n\nadequate alternative forum exists and that \"considerations of\n\nconvenience and judicial efficiency strongly favor litigating the\n\nclaim in the second forum.\"         Iragorri, 203 F.3d at 12 (emphasis\n\nadded).   Neither party disputes the availability and adequacy of\n\nthe Israeli forum.        The issue is whether the district court\n\nproperly balanced the factors in the second step of the analysis.\n\n           In this case, the district court found that the suit was\n\nnot vexatious and that no great equity weighed in the defendant's\n\nfavor.    Yet, because there was already a case pending before the\n\nIsraeli   court,   the   district   court   concluded   that   the   public\n\ninterest factors weighed in favor of dismissal. On appeal, Adelson\n\ncontends that the district court (1) improperly reversed the burden\n\nof proof, requiring the plaintiff to prove why he could not fairly\n\nlitigate his claim in Israel; (2) failed to give proper deference\n\nto a United States plaintiff's choice of forum; and (3) placed\n\nundue significance on the existence of concurrent litigation in the\n\nIsraeli court.     We agree with Adelson and reverse the district\n\ncourt's dismissal.\n\n           As a starting point, it is undisputed that a plaintiff\n\nenjoys some degree of deference for his original choice of forum.\n\nSee Gulf Oil, 330 U.S. at 508.         Added to that is the heightened\n\ndeference which accompanies a plaintiff's choice of home forum.\n\nSee Koster, 330 U.S. at 524 (holding that when the plaintiff has\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fchosen his home forum, he should not be deprived of it absent a\n\n\"clear showing\" of either \"oppressiveness and vexation\" or evidence\n\nthat the chosen forum is \"inappropriate\"). Although Adelson is not\n\na Massachusetts domiciliary, the Massachusetts district court is\n\nstill deemed a \"home forum\" where the alternative is foreign.           See\n\nReid-Walen v.

While the Supreme Court held that dismissal\n\nis \"not automatically barred\" in such cases, Piper Aircraft Co.,\n\n454 U.S. at 256 n.23, a heavy presumption weighs in favor of that\n\nplaintiff's initial forum choice.\n\n          In the past, we have implicitly recognized the \"strong\n\npresumption    favoring   the   American   forum   selected   by   American\n\nplaintiffs.\"    Mercier v.

Indeed, in its analysis up to that point, the\n\ndistrict court had found that the \"private interest factors did not\n\nweigh in favor of either party\" and that the public interest was\n\n\"also in equipoise between the parties.\"             Moreover, the court also\n\nfound that Adelson's suit was neither vexatious nor oppressive.\n\nThus, it was the existence of concurrent litigation that not only\n\ncaused the balance to shift in favor of the foreign forum, but also\n\neviscerated the presumption in favor of the plaintiff's forum.                In\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fdiscussing the Israeli suit, the district court stated, \"I see no\n\nreason why Adelson cannot fairly litigate his claim in Israel.\"\n\nThe   district    court   erred   in   so     construing    the   importance   of\n\nconcurrent litigation within the forum non conveniens analysis.\n\n           Having found the public and private interest factors to\n\nbe in equipoise, the district court should have concluded that the\n\ndefendant failed to overcome the heavy presumption in favor of the\n\nplaintiff's home forum.

Factors\n\nrelevant to the public interest analysis include:\n\n           administrative    difficulties    of    docket\n           congestion; the general goal of \"having\n           localized controversies decided at home,\" and\n           . . . ease of access to the proceedings on the\n           part of interested citizens, the trier's\n           relative familiarity with the appropriate\n           rules of decision, and the burdens of jury\n           duty.\n\nId. (quoting Gilbert, 330 U.S. at 508-509).                  The existence of\n\nconcurrent litigation is not a relevant factor to the analysis;\n\nnone of the factors enumerated above invokes a comparison between\n\nthe two competing fora.      By focusing on the existence of parallel\n\nproceedings in a foreign court, the district court essentially\n\nconverted the analysis into a determination of which of the two\n\npending   cases    should   go    forward.        In   so   doing,   the   court\n\nerroneously lowered the defendant's burden of proving that the\n\n                                       -21-\n\fbalance of factors justified dismissal of a suit from a U.S.\n\nplaintiff's choice of home forum.\n\n                           III.
