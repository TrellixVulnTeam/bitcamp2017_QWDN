Pro se appellant Michael B. McGann appeals\n\nfrom the district court's order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\n\ncomplaint for failure to meet the jurisdictional requirements of\n\nHeck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994).      We must affirm if, viewing\n\nall well-pleaded facts in the complaint as true and drawing all\n\nreasonable inferences in appellant's favor, \"it is transparently\n\nclear that the complaint, in light of the facts alleged, engenders\n\nno viable theory of liability.\"       Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v.\n\nFeliciano de Melecio, 406 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing\n\nEducadores Puertorriquenos en Accion v.

F.D.I.C., 244 F.3d\n\n193, 197 (1st Cir. 2001)).\n\n          Appellant alleges a wide-ranging conspiracy, involving\n\nnamed appellees and others, to cover up decades of allegedly\n\nillegal lawmaking in the State of New Hampshire, which rendered\n\nappellant's   indictment,    trial,    sentencing,   and   incarceration\n\nunconstitutional and entitles him to damages under 42 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1983.   In Heck v. Humphrey, the United States Supreme Court held\n\nthat \"in order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional\n\nconviction or imprisonment, or for other harms caused by actions\n\nwhose lawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid,\"\n\nthe plaintiff must first prove that his conviction or sentence has\n\nbeen \"reversed, expunged, invalidated, or impugned by grant of a\n\nwrit of habeas corpus.\"     512 U.S. at 486-87, 489; see also Figueroa\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fv. Rivera, 147 F.3d 77, 80-81 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"the impugning of an\n\nallegedly unconstitutional conviction in a separate, antecedent\n\nproceeding is a prerequisite to a resultant section 1983 action for\n\ndamages\") (emphasis removed).\n\n            The record shows that appellant's direct appeal failed,\n\nState of New Hampshire v. McGann, 514 A.2d 1247 (N.H. 1986), as did\n\nhis habeas petition, McGann v. Cunningham, No. 97-E-295 (Merrimack,\n\nN.H.

Having\n\nfailed to show that his conviction or sentence was set aside in a\n\nseparate,    antecedent     proceeding,   appellant's       current   action\n\n\"necessarily    impl[ies]    the   invalidity   of    his    conviction   or\n\nsentence.\"     Heck, 512 U.S. at 487.     The Heck decision therefore\n\nrequired that the district court \"deny the existence of [this]\n\ncause of action\" and dismiss the complaint.          Id. at 489.\n\n            The district court's order is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f",
