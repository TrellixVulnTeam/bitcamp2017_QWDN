On Friday evening,  October 27,\n                          \n\n1990, Michelle Eckman,  a student at the  University of Rhode\n\nIsland,  attended a fraternity  party at the  TKE fraternity.\n\nVery  early on  Saturday  morning,  Eckman  appeared  at  the\n\nuniversity health  clinic.  She  reported that  she had  been\n\nraped at  the TKE  fraternity around  midnight by a  \"pledge\"\n\nnamed  \"Dan\" who was  about 6  feet tall  with feathered-back\n\nblond hair.  She said that other men had attempted to assault\n\nher.  She  repeated her charge, in interviews  or in writing,\n\nduring the next several hours.  \n\n     At around 8 a.m. on  Saturday morning, October 28, 1990,\n\nLieutenant   James   McDonald   of   the  university   police\n\ninterviewed Eckman, obtained another description of the rape,\n\nand was told by Eckman  that her assailant wore a TKE  pledge\n\npin.   Other officers  then obtained separate  photographs of\n\nall 21 TKE pledges and  McDonald brought Eckman to the police\n\nstation to view the numbered photographs.  In the presence of\n\nMcDonald and  another officer, Eckman  positively and without\n\nhesitation  identified David  Lallemand as  the  man who  had\n\nraped  her.1   Based  on  this  photographic  identification,\n\n                    \n\n     1Lallemand is about  6 feet 7 inches  tall, considerably\nabove the 6 foot figure first mentioned by Eckman, and he did\nnot  have feathered  back blond  hair.   On  the other  hand,\nEckman told McDonald that her assailant was much  taller than\nanother  police  officer,  who stood  slightly  over  6 feet.\nEckman  also initially said that  Dan lived in her dormitory,\nwhich is not true of  Lallemand, but later indicated that she\nhad merely seen him there.\n\n                             -2-\n\nMcDonald  secured a warrant from a state district court judge\n\nand arrested Lallemand on October 30, 1990.  \n\n     On November 3,  1990, Eckman was interviewed  once again\n\nby McDonald and an officer  of the Rhode Island state police.\n\nDuring   this  interview  Eckman  said  that  she  remembered\n\nLallemand fondling her  when she entered  the room where  the\n\nrape took place; but she said that she no longer could recall\n\nthe  rape itself  and  could not  identify  Lallemand as  the\n\nrapist.  Her explanation was that  her memory was suppressing\n\nthe rape.   At  Lallemand's bail hearing on November 7, 1990,\n\nEckman was unable to identify  Lallemand as the man who raped\n\nher, and  charges against him  were dismissed.  A  grand jury\n\ninvestigated but returned no indictment.\n\n      Lallemand then filed  a civil complaint in  the present\n\ncase  charging McDonald, the university and its president and\n\nothers with  violations of 42  U.S.C.   1983.   The complaint\n\nalso  made claims  under state  law  but they  have not  been\n\npursued on this  appeal.   Although the  section 1983  claims\n\nwent  beyond  false arrest,  that  is  the  only charge  that\n\nLallemand has argued in his brief.  The essence of the charge\n\nis  that  McDonald  conducted  an  inadequate  investigation,\n\nignored  exculpatory information, and did not disclose all of\n\nthe evidence to the state judge who issued the warrant.\n\n     Following discovery in this case, McDonald and the other\n\ndefendants  moved for  summary judgment  on  the ground  that\n\n                             -3-\n\nMcDonald's  conduct was protected by qualified immunity.  The\n\nmagistrate  judge  recommended that  the  motion  be granted,\n\nconcluding  that  at the  time  of the  arrest,  McDonald had\n\nprobable  cause to believe  that Lallemand had  committed the\n\noffense.  The possibility that McDonald might have  done more\n\ninvestigating,  said  the  magistrate judge,  did  not create\n\nliability under section 1983.  The district court adopted the\n\nreport of the magistrate judge  and dismissed the case.  This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n     On this  appeal,  our review  on  the grant  of  summary\n\njudgment is plenary, Hoffman v. Reali, 973 F.2d 980, 984 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1992),  and we assume that genuinely  disputed facts and\n\ncredibility issues  would be  resolved in appellant's  favor.\n\nProkey  v.  Watkins,  942  F.2d  67,  72  (1st   Cir.  1990).\n                   \n\nQualified immunity is  available if the officer's  action was\n\nobjectively  reasonable even if  later found to  be mistaken.\n\nPierson  v.  Ray,  386 U.S.  547,  555-57  (1967);  Harlow v.\n                                                          \n\nFitzgerald,  457 U.S.  800, 818  (1982).   In a  false arrest\n          \n\ncase,  the question normally is whether the arresting officer\n\ncould  reasonably  believe  that the  information  he  or she\n\npossessed  constituted probable cause.  Hunter v. Bryant, 112\n                                                        \n\nS. Ct. 534, 537 (1991).\n\n     We begin with the objective reasonableness of McDonald's\n\nconduct,  reserving  for the  moment  Lallemand's alternative\n\nargument that McDonald's  subjective good faith was  an issue\n\n                             -4-\n\nfor the jury.  McDonald's  broadest defense on appeal is that\n\nhe  is insulated by the decision of  the state judge to issue\n\nan arrest  warrant.  We agree with  Lallemand that McDonald's\n\nreliance on United States v.  Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 928 (1984),\n                                  \n\nis misplaced.   Leon  does not  provide automatic  protection\n                    \n\nwhen  the  warrant itself  was  issued  on  the basis  of  an\n\naffidavit claimed to  be recklessly false.  468  U.S. at 914.\n\nSee  generally Rodriques  v. Furtado,  950 F.2d 805,  812 n.8\n                                    \n\n(1st  Cir.  1991).    Lallemand  claims  here  that  McDonald\n\npossessed information, undisclosed to the state  judge, which\n\nnegated probable cause.\n\n     We think it plain that the information disclosed to  the\n\nstate judge, if taken alone,  established probable cause.  In\n\nsubstance the  affidavit set  forth Eckman's  version of  the\n\nincident,  and followed  it  with  McDonald's description  of\n\nEckman  selecting  Lallemand's  photograph from  the  picture\n\narray and  positively identifying  Lallemand as  the man  who\n\nraped her.   Although Eckman said  that the perpetrator  gave\n\nhis  name as Dan, despite a few discrepancies in description,\n\nthe  affidavit presented facts giving rise to probable cause;\n\neverything turns on  what McDonald knew at the  time but left\n\nout of the affidavit.\n\n     The  single  most important  \"fact\"  allegedly  known to\n\nMcDonald but  not disclosed  in the  affidavit is that  other\n\neyewitnesses had identified a different man, Michael Lindell,\n\n                             -5-\n\nas the  person who--in  the words  of Lallemand's  brief--was\n\n\"Eckman's attacker\" and \"the perpetrator.\"  We need not weigh\n\nthe legal significance of such an omission in the  affidavit,\n\nbecause the supposed  \"fact\" is not supported  by the record.\n\nRather, Lallemand's brief has misstated the record. \n\n       What the record  indicates is that Michael  Brady, the\n\nhead of the fraternity, told McDonald and other officers that\n\nLindell should  be \"checked  out,\" in  the  words of  Brady's\n\nlater handwritten statement.  Although the statement does not\n\nexplain  what Brady  told the  campus  police about  Lindell,\n\nLallemand's brief offers  no record citation to  any evidence\n\nthat anyone identified  Lindell as having raped  or attempted\n\nto rape Eckman.   Instead, there are  fragments of evidence--\n\nsummaries  of  witness  interviews  apparently  conducted  by\n\nvarious police  officers--that suggest that Lindell  may have\n\npulled off Eckman's clothes and attempted to  urinate on her.\n\n     Taking  the interviews at face value, one might conclude\n\nthat Lindell, Lallemand  and possibly others had  been taking\n\nvarious liberties with Eckman, who by her own account had had\n\na  good deal  to drink.   It  is very hard  to tell  from the\n\nrecord  when each  witness interview  occurred  and how  much\n\nMcDonald  knew of these interviews when  he filed his arrest-\n\nwarrant  affidavit.   But  even  if he  knew  everything just\n\nrecited,  nothing  Lallemand  has pointed  to  in  the record\n\n                             -6-\n\nsuggests that Lindell  was identified by anyone as  a rapist.\n\nFurther Eckman had specifically stated that the rapist wore a\n\nTKE pledge  pin; Lallemand was  a TKE pledge and  Lindell was\n\nnot.  \n\n     Depending on what McDonald knew about Brady's suggestion\n\nthat the  police \"check out\"  Lindell, it might or  might not\n\nhave been good police practice to investigate Lindell further\n\nbefore  arresting Lallemand.    But  given Eckman's  positive\n\nidentification  of  Lallemand, there  was  probable  cause to\n\narrest him, and there would  have been probable cause even if\n\nthe affidavit  had disclosed everything  just recounted about\n\nLindell's possible  involvement.    See  generally  Krohn  v.\n                                                         \n\nUnited States, 742  F.2d 24,  31 (1st Cir.  1984).  What  the\n             \n\nwitness  said about  Lindell  could  easily  have  been  true\n\nwithout  casting  any  doubt on  Eckman's  identification  of\n\nLallemand.\n\n     It  may well be that McDonald  ought to have said in the\n\naffidavit submitted to the state  judge that Eckman had had a\n\nlot to  drink and  was probably drunk  that evening  (several\n\nwitnesses,  including one  friendly to  Eckman,  so claimed).\n\nThat a  rape victim was  drunk does not, of  course, remotely\n\nexcuse the offense; still, the only direct witness was Eckman\n\nand her condition bore upon her credibility.  Once again full\n\ndisclosure would not in any way have undercut probable cause.\n\nEckman's  identification  was  positive,  and  there  is   no\n\n                             -7-\n\nsuggestion that she was incoherent or vague when she gave her\n\nstatements to police or made the photographic identification.\n\nSee Clay v. Conlee, 815 F.2d 1164, 1168 (8th Cir. 1987).\n                  \n\n     Two further  claims in Lallemand's  briefs require  less\n\ndiscussion.   First, contrary to  the brief,  nothing in  the\n\nrecord citations  shows that  McDonald knew  that Eckman  was\n\nunconscious  \"during\"  the   rape  and  so  could   not  have\n\nidentified anyone; rather, there is some evidence that Eckman\n\nmight have passed  out \"sometime\" during  the assault.   With\n\nthis correction, the  passing out admission has  virtually no\n\nbearing  on  probable  cause.    There  is  nothing  remotely\n\nimplausible about  seeing one's  attacker  and then  becoming\n\nunconscious.\n\n     Second, Lallemand's brief makes  a considerable point of\n\nthe fact  that  McDonald  has admitted  that  he  now  doubts\n\nwhether   a  rape  occurred,  a  doubt  based  on  McDonald's\n\nstatement that  a \"rape  kit\" procedure  performed on  Eckman\n\ncame back  \"negative.\"   \"Not withstanding  [sic] this  known\n\nfact,\" says Lallemand's brief, McDonald \"still\" filed charges\n\nagainst  Lallemand.   Lallemand's  point  is  without  merit.\n\nMcDonald's  concession came long  after the arrest,  during a\n\ndeposition in this  case, and there is no  indication that he\n\n                             -8-\n\nknew  of  the negative  rape  kit  report  when he  made  the\n\narrest.2\n\n     Even  less  need  be  said  about Lallemand's  remaining\n\nreasons for his claim that  McDonald lacked probable cause or\n\nfiled  an  inadequate  arrest  warrant.    The  discrepancies\n\nconcerning the  assailant's first name, hair style, dormitory\n\nand height are trivial, given  their nature and the  positive\n\nidentification of Lallemand by  Eckman.  Lallemand's argument\n\nthat  McDonald  tampered  with  evidence   is  not  seriously\n\nsupported.   The undisputed facts show not only that McDonald\n\nhad  an  objectively  reasonable  basis  for  believing  that\n\nprobable  cause  existed--which   is  enough  for   qualified\n\nimmunity, Hunter, 112  S. Ct. at 536--but  also that probable\n                \n\ncause actually existed.\n\n     Lallemand also claims that  McDonald acted in subjective\n\nbad faith  and that  this presented a  factual issue  for the\n\njury.  The Supreme Court in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at\n                                                \n\n818,  cast great  doubt on whether  such a claim  has a legal\n\nbasis.  See Floyd v. Farrell, 765 F.2d 1, 6 (1st  Cir. 1985).\n                            \n\nIn any  event, there is here no  factual basis for the claim.\n\nThe main \"evidence\"  of such bad faith is  the admission made\n\n                    \n\n     2On the contrary, it  appears that the rape  kit samples\nwere submitted for analysis at  about the time the arrest was\nmade.  This may, or may not, have been poor police procedure;\nbut  a rape kit analysis is not a predicate to probable cause\nwhere the accuser says that she has been raped and identifies\nthe victim.  \n\n                             -9-\n\nby McDonald in his deposition  that the rape kit results made\n\nhim question  whether anyone  had raped  Eckman.   Since this\n\nadmission and  the knowledge it reflects both  came after the\n\narrest, they  provide no  evidence of bad  faith at  the only\n\ntime that matters.\n\n     This  brings us  to  Lallemand's  final  argument.    It\n\nappears that his counsel sought to subpoena  police files and\n\ngrand jury  testimony bearing on this case in connection with\n\nthis civil action.  The district  judge quashed the subpoenas\n\nand  entered a protective  order.  On  this appeal, Lallemand\n\nasserts that the files and  grand jury testimony were crucial\n\nto his case--the  assertions of need are  fairly general--and\n\nthat the district court erred in not enforcing the subpoenas.\n\n     We  need not pursue the question whether these materials\n\nwere  discoverable under Rhode Island law, a question raising\n\nlegal  issues  that  Lallemand  does  not  adequately  brief.\n\nMcDonald's  brief says  that practically  all  of the  police\n\nfiles were turned over during a deposition; that the district\n\ncourt's action  limiting discovery  was expressly subject  to\n\nreconsideration based on a more specific showing of need; and\n\nthat in opposing  summary judgment Lallemand did  not ask for\n\nfurther  discovery  or  claim that  he  could  not adequately\n\nrespond because of  the quashed subpoenas.  Lallemand has not\n\n                             -10-\n\ntroubled to file  a reply brief contesting  these assertions.\n\nTaking them as conceded, they resolve the matter.\n\n     The last  issue on  appeal  is the  claim of  McDonald's\n\ncounsel  that  double  costs and  attorneys'  fees  should be\n\nawarded because the appeal was frivolous, was brought  in bad\n\nfaith and was  premised upon a  deliberate distortion of  the\n\nfactual record.  See 28 U.S.C.    1912, 1927; Fed. R. App. P.\n\n38.  In  our view, there were  just enough loose ends  in the\n\ninvestigation to make  the appeal  legitimate, although  very\n\nlikely to  fail.   But an appeal  can be weak,  indeed almost\n\nhopeless, without being  frivolous, and we think  an award of\n\ndouble costs or attorneys' fees is not warranted.\n\n     In this case, the proper objection is not to the pursuit\n\nof the appeal; it is to the various distortions of the record\n\nwrought  by  Lallemand's  brief.   The  worst  examples, some\n\nrepeated  twice  or  more  in the  brief,  have  already been\n\nmentioned.  As is  usually the case, these tactics  undermine\n\nrather than bolster  the client's position.   The distortions\n\nare  easily rebutted, and they distract attention from better\n\narguments.   And once it is lost,  a court's trust in counsel\n\nis not readily restored.\n\n     The  judgment is affirmed  with ordinary costs  taxed to\n                              \n\nappellant.    Appellees'   request  for   double  costs   and\n\nattorneys' fees is denied.\n                         \n\n                             -11-\n",

At Lallemand's bail hearing on November 7, 1990, Eckman was unable to identify Lallemand as the man who raped her, and charges against him were dismissed.

Although the section 1983 claims went beyond false arrest, that is the only charge that Lallemand has argued in his brief.

The possibility that McDonald might have done more investigating, said the magistrate judge, did not create liability under section 1983.

McDonald's broadest defense on appeal is that he is insulated by the decision of the state judge to issue an arrest warrant.  We agree with Lallemand that McDonald's reliance on United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 928, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 3423, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), is misplaced.

See generally Rodriques v. Furtado, 950 F.2d 805, 812 n. 8 (1st Cir.1991).

In substance the affidavit set forth Eckman's version of the incident, and followed it with McDonald's description of Eckman selecting Lallemand's photograph from the picture array and positively identifying Lallemand as the man who raped her.  Although Eckman said that the perpetrator gave his name as Dan, despite a few discrepancies in description, the affidavit presented facts giving rise to probable cause;  everything turns on what McDonald knew at the time but left out of the affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The single most important \"fact\" allegedly known to McDonald but not disclosed in the affidavit is that other eyewitnesses had identified a different man, Michael Lindell, as the person who--in the words of Lallemand's brief--was \"Eckman's attacker\" and \"the perpetrator.\"   We need not weigh the legal significance of such an omission in the affidavit, because the supposed \"fact\" is not supported by the record.  Rather, Lallemand's brief has misstated the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What the record indicates is that Michael Brady, the head of the fraternity, told McDonald and other officers that Lindell should be \"checked out,\" in the words of Brady's later handwritten statement.  Although the statement does not explain what Brady told the campus police about Lindell, Lallemand's brief offers no record citation to any evidence that anyone identified Lindell as having raped or attempted to rape Eckman.  Instead, there are fragments of evidence--summaries of witness interviews apparently conducted by various police officers--that suggest that Lindell may have pulled off Eckman's clothes and attempted to urinate on her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking the interviews at face value, one might conclude that Lindell, Lallemand and possibly others had been taking various liberties with Eckman, who by her own account had had a good deal to drink.  It is very hard to tell from the record when each witness interview occurred and how much McDonald knew of these interviews when he filed his arrest-warrant affidavit.  But even if he knew everything just recited, nothing Lallemand has pointed to in the record suggests that Lindell was identified by anyone as a rapist.  Further Eckman had specifically stated that the rapist wore a TKE pledge pin;  Lallemand was a TKE pledge and Lindell was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Depending on what McDonald knew about Brady's suggestion that the police \"check out\" Lindell, it might or might not have been good police practice to investigate Lindell further before arresting Lallemand.  But given Eckman's positive identification of Lallemand, there was probable cause to arrest him, and there would have been probable cause even if the affidavit had disclosed everything just recounted about Lindell's possible involvement.  See generally Krohn v. United States, 742 F.2d 24, 31 (1st Cir.1984).  What the witness said about Lindell could easily have been true without casting any doubt on Eckman's identification of Lallemand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may well be that McDonald ought to have said in the affidavit submitted to the state judge that Eckman had had a lot to drink and was probably drunk that evening (several witnesses, including one friendly to Eckman, so claimed).  That a rape victim was drunk does not, of course, remotely excuse the offense;  still, the only direct witness was Eckman and her condition bore upon her credibility.  Once again full disclosure would not in any way have undercut probable cause.  Eckman's identification was positive, and there is no suggestion that she was incoherent or vague when she gave her statements to police or made the photographic identification.  See Clay v. Conlee, 815 F.2d 1164, 1168 (8th Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two further claims in Lallemand's briefs require less discussion.  First, contrary to the brief, nothing in the record citations shows that McDonald knew that Eckman was unconscious \"during\" the rape and so could not have identified anyone;  rather, there is some evidence that Eckman might have passed out \"sometime\" during the assault.  With this correction, the passing out admission has virtually no bearing on probable cause.  There is nothing remotely implausible about seeing one's attacker and then becoming unconscious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Lallemand's brief makes a considerable point of the fact that McDonald has admitted that he now doubts whether a rape occurred, a doubt based on McDonald's statement that a \"rape kit\" procedure performed on Eckman came back \"negative.\"  \"Not withstanding [sic] this known fact,\" says Lallemand's brief, McDonald \"still\" filed charges against Lallemand.  Lallemand's point is without merit.  McDonald's concession came long after the arrest, during a deposition in this case, and there is no indication that he knew of the negative rape kit report when he made the arrest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even less need be said about Lallemand's remaining reasons for his claim that McDonald lacked probable cause or filed an inadequate arrest warrant.  The discrepancies concerning the assailant's first name, hair style, dormitory and height are trivial, given their nature and the positive identification of Lallemand by Eckman.  Lallemand's argument that McDonald tampered with evidence is not seriously supported.  The undisputed facts show not only that McDonald had an objectively reasonable basis for believing that probable cause existed--which is enough for qualified immunity, Hunter, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 536--but also that probable cause actually existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lallemand also claims that McDonald acted in subjective bad faith and that this presented a factual issue for the jury.  The Supreme Court in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2738, cast great doubt on whether such a claim has a legal basis.  See Floyd v. Farrell, 765 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1985).  In any event, there is here no factual basis for the claim.  The main \"evidence\" of such bad faith is the admission made by McDonald in his deposition that the rape kit results made him question whether anyone had raped Eckman.  Since this admission and the knowledge it reflects both came after the arrest, they provide no evidence of bad faith at the only time that matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Lallemand's final argument.  It appears that his counsel sought to subpoena police files and grand jury testimony bearing on this case in connection with this civil action.  The district judge quashed the subpoenas and entered a protective order.  On this appeal, Lallemand asserts that the files and grand jury testimony were crucial to his case--the assertions of need are fairly general--and that the district court erred in not enforcing the subpoenas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not pursue the question whether these materials were discoverable under Rhode Island law, a question raising legal issues that Lallemand does not adequately brief.  McDonald's brief says that practically all of the police files were turned over during a deposition;  that the district court's action limiting discovery was expressly subject to reconsideration based on a more specific showing of need;  and that in opposing summary judgment Lallemand did not ask for further discovery or claim that he could not adequately respond because of the quashed subpoenas.  Lallemand has not troubled to file a reply brief contesting these assertions.  Taking them as conceded, they resolve the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last issue on appeal is the claim of McDonald's counsel that double costs and attorneys' fees should be awarded because the appeal was frivolous, was brought in bad faith and was premised upon a deliberate distortion of the factual record.  See 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1912, 1927;  Fed.R.App.P. 38.  In our view, there were just enough loose ends in the investigation to make the appeal legitimate, although very likely to fail.  But an appeal can be weak, indeed almost hopeless, without being frivolous, and we think an award of double costs or attorneys' fees is not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the proper objection is not to the pursuit of the appeal;  it is to the various distortions of the record wrought by Lallemand's brief.  The worst examples, some repeated twice or more in the brief, have already been mentioned.  As is usually the case, these tactics undermine rather than bolster the client's position.  The distortions are easily rebutted, and they distract attention from better argument.  And once it is lost, a court's trust in counsel is not readily restored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is affirmed with ordinary costs taxed to appellant.  Appellees' request for double costs and attorneys' fees is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Lallemand is about 6 feet 7 inches tall, considerably above the 6 foot figure first mentioned by Eckman, and he did not have feathered back blond hair.  On the other hand, Eckman told McDonald that her assailant was much taller than another police officer, who stood slightly over 6 feet.  Eckman also initially said that Dan lived in her dormitory, which is not true of Lallemand, but later indicated that she had merely seen him there</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> On the contrary, it appears that the rape kit samples were submitted for analysis at about the time the arrest was made.  This may, or may not, have been poor police procedure;  but a rape kit analysis is not a predicate to probable cause where the accuser says that she has been raped and identifies the victim</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Very early on Saturday morning, Eckman appeared at the university health clinic.  She reported that she had been raped at the TKE fraternity around midnight by a \"pledge\" named \"Dan\" who was about 6 feet tall with feathered-back blond hair.  She said that other men had attempted to assault her.

Other officers then obtained separate photographs of all 21 TKE pledges and McDonald brought Eckman to the police station to view the numbered photographs.  In the presence of McDonald and another officer, Eckman positively and without hesitation identified David Lallemand as the man who had raped her.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Based on this photographic identification, McDonald secured a warrant from a state district court judge and arrested Lallemand on October 30, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 3, 1990, Eckman was interviewed once again by McDonald and an officer of the Rhode Island state police.

Her explanation was that her memory was suppressing the rape.

But even if he knew everything just recited, nothing Lallemand has pointed to in the record suggests that Lindell was identified by anyone as a rapist.  Further Eckman had specifically stated that the rapist wore a TKE pledge pin;  Lallemand was a TKE pledge and Lindell was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Depending on what McDonald knew about Brady's suggestion that the police \"check out\" Lindell, it might or might not have been good police practice to investigate Lindell further before arresting Lallemand.  But given Eckman's positive identification of Lallemand, there was probable cause to arrest him, and there would have been probable cause even if the affidavit had disclosed everything just recounted about Lindell's possible involvement.  See generally Krohn v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"440322\"><a href=\"/opinion/440322/kenneth-b-krohn-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">742</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.1984).  What the witness said about Lindell could easily have been true without casting any doubt on Eckman's identification of Lallemand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may well be that McDonald ought to have said in the affidavit submitted to the state judge that Eckman had had a lot to drink and was probably drunk that evening (several witnesses, including one friendly to Eckman, so claimed).  That a rape victim was drunk does not, of course, remotely excuse the offense;  still, the only direct witness was Eckman and her condition bore upon her credibility.  Once again full disclosure would not in any way have undercut probable cause.  Eckman's identification was positive, and there is no suggestion that she was incoherent or vague when she gave her statements to police or made the photographic identification.  See Clay v. Conlee, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"486432\"><a href=\"/opinion/486432/andrew-clay-v-coolidge-conlee-individually-and-in-his-official-capacity/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1164</span></a></span>, 1168 (8th Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two further claims in Lallemand's briefs require less discussion.  First, contrary to the brief, nothing in the record citations shows that McDonald knew that Eckman was unconscious \"during\" the rape and so could not have identified anyone;  rather, there is some evidence that Eckman might have passed out \"sometime\" during the assault.  With this correction, the passing out admission has virtually no bearing on probable cause.  There is nothing remotely implausible about seeing one's attacker and then becoming unconscious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Lallemand's brief makes a considerable point of the fact that McDonald has admitted that he now doubts whether a rape occurred, a doubt based on McDonald's statement that a \"rape kit\" procedure performed on Eckman came back \"negative.\"  \"Not withstanding [sic] this known fact,\" says Lallemand's brief, McDonald \"still\" filed charges against Lallemand.  Lallemand's point is without merit.  McDonald's concession came long after the arrest, during a deposition in this case, and there is no indication that he knew of the negative rape kit report when he made the arrest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even less need be said about Lallemand's remaining reasons for his claim that McDonald lacked probable cause or filed an inadequate arrest warrant.  The discrepancies concerning the assailant's first name, hair style, dormitory and height are trivial, given their nature and the positive identification of Lallemand by Eckman.  Lallemand's argument that McDonald tampered with evidence is not seriously supported.  The undisputed facts show not only that McDonald had an objectively reasonable basis for believing that probable cause existed--which is enough for qualified immunity, Hunter, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 536--but also that probable cause actually existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lallemand also claims that McDonald acted in subjective bad faith and that this presented a factual issue for the jury.  The Supreme Court in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2738, cast great doubt on whether such a claim has a legal basis.  See Floyd v. Farrell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"453598\"><a href=\"/opinion/453598/barry-eric-floyd-v-richard-j-farrell-jr-individually-and-in-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1985).  In any event, there is here no factual basis for the claim.  The main \"evidence\" of such bad faith is the admission made by McDonald in his deposition that the rape kit results made him question whether anyone had raped Eckman.  Since this admission and the knowledge it reflects both came after the arrest, they provide no evidence of bad faith at the only time that matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Lallemand's final argument.  It appears that his counsel sought to subpoena police files and grand jury testimony bearing on this case in connection with this civil action.  The district judge quashed the subpoenas and entered a protective order.  On this appeal, Lallemand asserts that the files and grand jury testimony were crucial to his case--the assertions of need are fairly general--and that the district court erred in not enforcing the subpoenas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not pursue the question whether these materials were discoverable under Rhode Island law, a question raising legal issues that Lallemand does not adequately brief.  McDonald's brief says that practically all of the police files were turned over during a deposition;  that the district court's action limiting discovery was expressly subject to reconsideration based on a more specific showing of need;  and that in opposing summary judgment Lallemand did not ask for further discovery or claim that he could not adequately respond because of the quashed subpoenas.  Lallemand has not troubled to file a reply brief contesting these assertions.  Taking them as conceded, they resolve the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last issue on appeal is the claim of McDonald's counsel that double costs and attorneys' fees should be awarded because the appeal was frivolous, was brought in bad faith and was premised upon a deliberate distortion of the factual record.  See 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1912, 1927;  Fed.R.App.P. 38.  In our view, there were just enough loose ends in the investigation to make the appeal legitimate, although very likely to fail.  But an appeal can be weak, indeed almost hopeless, without being frivolous, and we think an award of double costs or attorneys' fees is not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the proper objection is not to the pursuit of the appeal;  it is to the various distortions of the record wrought by Lallemand's brief.  The worst examples, some repeated twice or more in the brief, have already been mentioned.  As is usually the case, these tactics undermine rather than bolster the client's position.  The distortions are easily rebutted, and they distract attention from better argument.  And once it is lost, a court's trust in counsel is not readily restored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is affirmed with ordinary costs taxed to appellant.  Appellees' request for double costs and attorneys' fees is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Lallemand is about 6 feet 7 inches tall, considerably above the 6 foot figure first mentioned by Eckman, and he did not have feathered back blond hair.  On the other hand, Eckman told McDonald that her assailant was much taller than another police officer, who stood slightly over 6 feet.  Eckman also initially said that Dan lived in her dormitory, which is not true of Lallemand, but later indicated that she had merely seen him there</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> On the contrary, it appears that the rape kit samples were submitted for analysis at about the time the arrest was made.  This may, or may not, have been poor police procedure;  but a rape kit analysis is not a predicate to probable cause where the accuser says that she has been raped and identifies the victim</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
