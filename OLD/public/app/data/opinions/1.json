José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n              Selya, Boudin and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal Public Defender, and Vivianne M.\nMarrero, Assistant Federal Public Defender, on brief for appellant.\n     Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Chief, Appellate Division, and Thomas F. Klumper,\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          February 10, 2010\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.           On August 13, 2008, defendant-\n\nappellant Noel Dávila-González entered a straight plea of guilty to\n\ncharges of (i) aiding and abetting the laundering of money derived\n\nfrom unlawful activities and (ii) conspiracy to commit money\n\nlaundering.        See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 1956(a)(1)(B), 1956(h).              The\n\ndistrict court sentenced him to serve a 78-month incarcerative\n\nterm.    The appellant now challenges his sentence, citing a number\n\nof    supposed     procedural   errors.      Discerning   no   merit   in   the\n\nappellant's claims, we affirm.\n\n            When a sentencing appeal follows a guilty plea, \"we glean\n\nthe     relevant    facts   from    the     change-of-plea     colloquy,    the\n\nunchallenged portions of the presentence investigation report (PSI\n\nReport), and the record of the disposition hearing.\" United States\n\nv. Vargas, 560 F.3d 45, 47 (1st Cir. 2009).               In following this\n\npraxis, we rehearse only those facts that are needed to put the\n\nclaims of error into context.\n\n            On October 15, 2004, the appellant called a known member\n\nof a drug cartel to arrange for the delivery of \"two bundles.\"\n\nUnfortunately for the appellant, the person to whom he reached out\n\ndoubled in brass as a confidential informant for the Federal Bureau\n\nof Investigation (FBI).         Over the course of several calls, most of\n\nwhich were recorded, the appellant and the informant agreed to meet\n\nand consummate the transaction.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f              This meeting took place at a Burger King restaurant in\n\nPuerto Rico on October 18, 2004.                        At that time the appellant\n\neffected      delivery       of    the    \"two      bundles\"      to    the       informant.\n\nSubsequent analysis revealed that the \"two bundles\" contained\n\n$204,440 in United States currency.\n\n              Rather than springing the trap then and there, the FBI\n\ncontinued its investigation for nearly three years.                               On May 3,\n\n2007, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico\n\nreturned a six-count indictment against the appellant and others.\n\nThe authorities arrested the appellant in Tampa, Florida, on May 9,\n\n2008.      Following his rendition to Puerto Rico, the appellant\n\nentered a plea of guilty to the three counts against him (one of\n\nwhich was dismissed at sentencing).\n\n              The district court convened the disposition hearing on\n\nNovember    13,    2008.          The   court    deemed      applicable       a   six-level\n\nsentencing enhancement after finding that \"the defendant knew or\n\nbelieved that any of the laundered funds were the proceeds of, or\n\nwere    intended        to   promote     .   .     .    an   offense     involving      the\n\nmanufacture, importation, or distribution of a controlled substance\n\nor a listed chemical.\"              USSG §2S1.1(b)(1)(B)(i).                 It also ruled\n\nthat,   for    sentencing         purposes,        it    would   hold    the      appellant\n\nresponsible       for    only     the    cash    contained       in    the    two   bundles\n\n($204,440), even though the conspiracy as a whole had laundered a\n\nmuch greater sum (approximately $1,839,208).\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\f            The court then proceeded to deny the appellant's request\n\nfor a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment.             See USSG §3B1.2(b)\n\n(authorizing a two-level downward adjustment if the defendant\n\nplayed a minor role in the offense).             Making a series of other\n\ncalculations, the court settled upon a total offense level of 25\n\nand a criminal history category of III.                 In this venue, the\n\nappellant does not challenge any of these rulings but, rather,\n\naccepts    the   district    court's     calculation     of    the      guideline\n\nsentencing range (GSR): 70-87 months.\n\n            During   the    sentencing      proceedings,      defense    counsel\n\nbriefly mentioned that the appellant was a former heroin addict\n\nwho, since committing the offense of conviction, had rehabilitated\n\nhimself.    This information led to the following exchange:\n\n            The Court: So what are you suggesting?\n\n            Defense Counsel: I'm suggesting that the Court\n            depart downward because this . . .\n\n            The Court: Absolutely not.          On the basis of\n            what?\n\nTo this question, defense counsel explicated, in some detail, that\n\nduring the years intervening between the offense conduct and the\n\narrest, the appellant had checked himself into a rehabilitation\n\nfacility, moved to Florida, forsook his criminal ways, and obtained\n\ngainful    employment.      Counsel    argued    that   these    developments\n\nsuggested that a below-the-range sentence would be an appropriate\n\noutcome.    The district court disagreed, stating:\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            I'm going to deny the role request that you're\n            making.    I am going to deny the departure\n            request you're going to make, and I'm going to\n            deny any other sentence than the advisory\n            guideline proposed here.\n                    There is nothing on this record under\n            3553(a) that moves me, moves me to consider\n            any other sentence than the sentence proposed\n            as advisory by the guidelines for cases like\n            this.\n\n            In the end, the court imposed a mid-range sentence of 78\n\nmonths in prison.        At the conclusion of the hearing, it asked\n\nwhether either side had \"[a]nything else?\"            The only rejoinder was\n\nfrom defense counsel, who requested that the sentence be served in\n\n\"the Tampa area.\"\n\n            In this appeal, the appellant argues that the sentencing\n\ncourt     committed     reversible     error    by     (i)   presuming    the\n\nreasonableness of the GSR; (ii) neglecting sufficiently to explain\n\nthe sentence imposed; and (iii) failing to consider mitigating\n\nfactors favoring a below-the-range sentence.              We approach these\n\nclaims of error mindful that, in the wake of the Supreme Court's\n\nlandmark decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 245\n\n(2005),    we   have   encouraged    the   district    courts   to   follow   a\n\nspecifically delineated roadmap when sentencing under the now-\n\nadvisory federal sentencing guidelines:\n\n            [A] sentencing court ordinarily should begin\n            by   calculating  the   applicable   guideline\n            sentencing range; then determine whether or\n            not any departures are in order; then mull the\n            factors delineated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) as\n            well as any other relevant considerations;\n            and, finally, determine what sentence, whether\n\n                                     -5-\n\f                within,   above,  or   below  the   guideline\n                sentencing range, appears appropriate.\n\nUnited States v. Pelletier, 469 F.3d 194, 203 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(citing United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518-19 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (en banc)).\n\n                The court below did not follow this roadmap.                     That\n\nomission complicates appellate review, but in this instance it does\n\nnot frustrate that review. After all, we have treated this roadmap\n\nas helpful, but not obligatory. Thus, a sentencing court may leave\n\nthe roadmap to one side and proceed in some other sequence as long\n\nas   the   findings      are   made    and   all    the   requisite    factors    are\n\naddressed.        See, e.g., United States v. Pacheco, 489 F.3d 40, 44\n\n(1st Cir. 2007) (explaining that district court may combine steps\n\nor vary the order).        This is such a case.\n\n                In reviewing a sentence, we seek to ensure that it is\n\nboth procedurally sound and substantively reasonable.                        United\n\nStates     v.    Martin,   520   F.3d    87,   92    (1st    Cir.   2008).   Here,\n\nsubstantive reasonableness is not in issue; the appellant assigns\n\nonly   procedural       error.        That   taxonomy       includes   \"failing    to\n\ncalculate        (or   improperly     calculating)        the   Guidelines   range,\n\ntreating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly\n\nerroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen\n\nsentence.\"       United States v. Stone, 575 F.3d 83, 89 (1st Cir. 2009)\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f(quoting United States v. Innarelli, 524 F.3d 286, 292 (1st Cir.\n\n2008)).\n\n           The appellant's claims of error, like all claims of\n\nprocedural unreasonableness in sentencing, are reviewed, generally,\n\nfor abuse of discretion.    United States v. Carrasco-De-Jesús, 589\n\nF.3d 22, 26-27 (1st Cir. 2009); Martin, 520 F.3d at 92.             Yet, when\n\na defendant fails to preserve an objection below, the plain error\n\nstandard supplants the customary standard of review.               See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Almenas, 553 F.3d 27, 36 (1st Cir. 2009); United\n\nStates v. Mangual-Garcia, 505 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n           In the case at hand, the appellant did not interpose an\n\nobjection as to any of the procedures that he now seeks to\n\nchallenge.   This default is particularly glaring in view of the\n\ndistrict   court's   specific   inquiry      at    the   conclusion   of   the\n\ndisposition hearing.     Consequently, plain error review obtains.\n\n\"Review for plain error entails four showings: (1) that an error\n\noccurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3)\n\naffected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously\n\nimpaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.\"   United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n           Against   this   backdrop    we        proceed   to   address   the\n\nappellant's claims of error one by one.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f            The first issue deals with the weight that the district\n\ncourt attached to the GSR.       The touchstone for our analysis is the\n\ndecision in Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38 (2007).           There, the\n\nSupreme Court admonished that even though the federal sentencing\n\nguidelines \"should be the starting point and the initial benchmark\"\n\nfor constructing a sentence, the sentencing court \"may not presume\n\nthat the Guidelines range is reasonable.\"          Id. at 49-50.\n\n            Citing the Court's follow-on decision in Nelson v. United\n\nStates, 129 S. Ct. 890 (2009) (per curiam), the appellant labors to\n\nconvince us that the court below transgressed this tenet.                In\n\nparticular, he assails the court's statement that it was \"going to\n\ndeny any other sentence than the advisory guideline proposed\" and\n\nits summary rejection of his entreaty to depart downward.            In the\n\nappellant's view, these actions demonstrate the sentencing court's\n\nembrace    of   the   very   presumption   of   reasonableness   that   Gall\n\nforbids.\n\n            We find this argument unpersuasive.         To begin, Nelson\n\ndoes not assist the appellant's cause.          There, the district court\n\nunequivocally declared at sentencing that \"the Guidelines are\n\nconsidered presumptively reasonable.\"           Id. at 891.      That was a\n\npatent violation of the tenet articulated in Gall.\n\n            The case at bar is at a considerable remove.           Here, the\n\nsentencing court made no such declaration. Although it declined to\n\naccept the appellant's proposal for a non-guideline sentence (24\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fmonths), it made that ruling only after hearing lengthy arguments\n\nas to whether and why the GSR should hold sway.                           The court\n\nconcluded that there was \"nothing on th[e] record\" that prompted it\n\n\"to consider any other sentence than the sentence proposed as\n\nadvisory by the guidelines.\"\n\n               There is a world of difference between according a\n\npresumption of reasonableness to the GSR — a practice that Gall\n\nforbids    —    and    finding    that   the     GSR,   in    a    particular    case,\n\nrepresents an appropriate sentencing range.                  This is a case of the\n\nlatter stripe.\n\n               Read as a whole, the sentencing transcript makes manifest\n\nnot only the court's awareness that the GSR was merely an initial\n\nbenchmark, but also its conclusion that the circumstances of the\n\ncase made it appropriate to hew to that benchmark in fashioning the\n\nappellant's sentence.            That was not error.              See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Smith, 531 F.3d 109, 112 (1st Cir. 2008) (finding no\n\npresumption of reasonableness where the district court \"did not\n\nfeel bound to impose a sentence within the GSR\").\n\n               The appellant's next contention is that the district\n\ncourt failed adequately to explain its rationale for the sentence\n\nit imposed.        In this regard, the appellant invokes a statute\n\nproviding that, in a federal criminal case, a sentencing court must\n\n\"state    in    open   court     the   reasons    for   its       imposition    of   the\n\nparticular sentence.\"          18 U.S.C. § 3553(c).\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f                 We have recognized, however, that this directive must be\n\nread in a practical, common-sense way.                    The statutory directive\n\n\"does not mean that the sentencing court's explanation need be\n\nprecise to the point of pedantry.\"                     United States v. Turbides-\n\nLeonardo, 468 F.3d 34, 40 (1st Cir. 2006).                    In all events, \"with\n\nrespect to a sentencing court's duty of explanation, brevity is not\n\nto    be    confused    with     inattention.\"          Id.   at   41-42.     This   is\n\nespecially true where, as here, a court prescribes a sentence that\n\nfalls within the GSR.             See id. at 41; see also Rita v. United\n\nStates, 551 U.S. 338, 356-57 (2007) (\"[W]hen a judge decides simply\n\nto apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not\n\nnecessarily require lengthy explanation.\").                    Where, as here, the\n\nGSR has been correctly calculated and spans less than 24 months\n\nfrom bottom to top, a district court \"arguably is not required to\n\ncite       any   reasons   for    imposing       a    within-the-range      sentence.\"\n\nTurbides-Leonardo, 468 F.3d at 41 (emphasis in original).\n\n                 These principles are dispositive here.              Although it is\n\ntrue that the district court did not explicitly address each of the\n\nappellant's arguments for a below-the-range sentence, the court was\n\nnot required to offer that level of elucidation.                   See id. at 40-41.\n\nA    sentencing      court's     process    of       ratiocination   \"can    often   be\n\ninferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained\n\nin the pre-sentence report with what the judge did.\"                         Jiménez-\n\nBeltre, 440 F.3d at 519; see also Rita, 551 U.S. at 358 (holding\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\fthat where the sentencing court imposed a within-the-range sentence\n\nand the record indicates that the court heard the defendant's\n\narguments   and    considered   the    supporting      evidence,   it   may   be\n\ninferred    that   \"[t]he   judge     simply   found    the[]   circumstances\n\ninsufficient to warrant a sentence lower than the Guidelines\n\nrange\").\n\n            So it is here: we may infer from the protracted arguments\n\nand colloquy preceding the imposition of sentence that the court\n\nbelow considered all the arguments and evidence before settling\n\nupon an appropriate sentence. The court's clear pronouncement that\n\nthere was nothing in the record that warranted unusually favorable\n\ntreatment bolsters this inference.\n\n            As a subset of this argument, the appellant suggests that\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)(1) required more specificity. That suggestion,\n\nhowever, is grounded in a misreading of the statute.1                     This\n\nprovision applies only when the span of the GSR, measured from the\n\nlow end to the high end, is greater than 24 months.                See United\n\nStates v. Arango, 508 F.3d 34, 44 (1st Cir. 2007); United States v.\n\nCirilo-Muñoz, 504 F.3d 106, 131 (1st Cir. 2007) (per curiam).\n\nHere, the sentencing range begins at 70 months and tops off at 87\n\nmonths. Simple arithmetic demonstrates that the spread between the\n\n\n\n     1\n       18 U.S.C. § 3553(c) provides in pertinent part that if the\nGSR \"exceeds 24 months,\" the court \"shall state in open court . . .\nthe reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the\nrange.\"\n\n                                      -11-\n\flow   and    high    ends    is   too   modest    to     trigger      the    statutory\n\nrequirement.\n\n             The appellant's final claim of error is that the district\n\ncourt failed to consider mitigating factors favoring a below-the-\n\nrange sentence.2           Specifically, he complains that he was less\n\nculpable     than      his    confederates,        and     that       he     undertook\n\nrehabilitative efforts of his own volition.                    These plaints lack\n\nforce.\n\n             Merely raising potentially mitigating factors does not\n\nguarantee a lesser sentence.            \"A criminal defendant is entitled to\n\na weighing of the section 3553(a) factors that are relevant to\n\n[his] case, not to a particular result.\"                 Carrasco-De-Jesús, 589\n\nF.3d at 29.\n\n             Here, the sentencing court heard about a myriad of\n\ncircumstances, including the appellant's relative culpability and\n\nefforts     at    rehabilitation.        The    court    determined         that   those\n\ncircumstances did not warrant the degree of leniency that the\n\nappellant        sought.     Although    the    court    did    not    specifically\n\nreference the factors that the appellant now highlights, the\n\nsentencing transcript, read as a whole, evinces a sufficient\n\nweighing of the section 3553(a) factors.                  See United States v.\n\n\n      2\n       The government urges us to deem this claim of error waived\nby reason of the cursory treatment given to it in the appellant's\nbrief.   See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n1990). Because the claim is easily dispatched on the merits, we\nbypass the waiver question.\n\n                                         -12-\n\fQuiñones-Medina, 553 F.3d 19, 26-27 (1st Cir. 2009); see also\n\nTurbides-Leonardo, 468 F.3d at 41-42.   And the fact that the court\n\nstated that it had considered all the section 3553(a) factors is\n\nentitled to some weight. See United States v. Morales-Machuca, 546\n\nF.3d 13, 26 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n          Pointing to one of his codefendants, the appellant makes\n\na related claim of sentencing disparity.3   That claim is hopeless.\n\n          A district court's consideration of sentencing disparity\n\n\"aims primarily at the minimization of disparities among defendants\n\nnationally.\"   Martin, 520 F.3d at 94; see also United States v.\n\nRodríguez-Lozada, 558 F.3d 29, 45 (1st Cir. 2009). While avoidance\n\nof disparities among codefendants may be considered, a party \"is\n\nnot entitled to a lighter sentence merely because his co-defendants\n\nreceived lighter sentences.\"   United States v. Wallace, 573 F.3d\n\n82, 97 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting United States v. Marceau, 554 F.3d\n\n24, 33 (1st Cir. 2009)).\n\n          The sockdolager is that the record contains no evidence\n\nthat the appellant and any codefendant were fair congeners.   Among\n\nother things, the codefendant pleaded guilty in accordance with a\n\nnegotiated plea agreement and, therefore, was not in that respect\n\nsituated similarly to the appellant.     See Rodríguez-Lozada, 558\n\nF.3d at 45.\n\n\n     3\n       Codefendant Oneil Concepción-Zapata was sentenced on June\n16, 2008, pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, to 46 months in\nprison.\n\n                               -13-\n\f            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe conclude that the sentencing in this case was free from error,\n\nplain or otherwise.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f",

On August 13, 2008, defendant-\n\nappellant Noel Dávila-González entered a straight plea of guilty to\n\ncharges of (i) aiding and abetting the laundering of money derived\n\nfrom unlawful activities and (ii) conspiracy to commit money\n\nlaundering.        See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 1956(a)(1)(B), 1956(h).              The\n\ndistrict court sentenced him to serve a 78-month incarcerative\n\nterm.

In following this\n\npraxis, we rehearse only those facts that are needed to put the\n\nclaims of error into context.\n\n            On October 15, 2004, the appellant called a known member\n\nof a drug cartel to arrange for the delivery of \"two bundles.\"\n\nUnfortunately for the appellant, the person to whom he reached out\n\ndoubled in brass as a confidential informant for the Federal Bureau\n\nof Investigation (FBI).         Over the course of several calls, most of\n\nwhich were recorded, the appellant and the informant agreed to meet\n\nand consummate the transaction.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f              This meeting took place at a Burger King restaurant in\n\nPuerto Rico on October 18, 2004.                        At that time the appellant\n\neffected      delivery       of    the    \"two      bundles\"      to    the       informant.\n\nSubsequent analysis revealed that the \"two bundles\" contained\n\n$204,440 in United States currency.\n\n              Rather than springing the trap then and there, the FBI\n\ncontinued its investigation for nearly three years.                               On May 3,\n\n2007, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico\n\nreturned a six-count indictment against the appellant and others.\n\nThe authorities arrested the appellant in Tampa, Florida, on May 9,\n\n2008.      Following his rendition to Puerto Rico, the appellant\n\nentered a plea of guilty to the three counts against him (one of\n\nwhich was dismissed at sentencing).\n\n              The district court convened the disposition hearing on\n\nNovember    13,    2008.          The   court    deemed      applicable       a   six-level\n\nsentencing enhancement after finding that \"the defendant knew or\n\nbelieved that any of the laundered funds were the proceeds of, or\n\nwere    intended        to   promote     .   .     .    an   offense     involving      the\n\nmanufacture, importation, or distribution of a controlled substance\n\nor a listed chemical.\"              USSG §2S1.1(b)(1)(B)(i).                 It also ruled\n\nthat,   for    sentencing         purposes,        it    would   hold    the      appellant\n\nresponsible       for    only     the    cash    contained       in    the    two   bundles\n\n($204,440), even though the conspiracy as a whole had laundered a\n\nmuch greater sum (approximately $1,839,208).\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\f            The court then proceeded to deny the appellant's request\n\nfor a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment.             See USSG §3B1.2(b)\n\n(authorizing a two-level downward adjustment if the defendant\n\nplayed a minor role in the offense).             Making a series of other\n\ncalculations, the court settled upon a total offense level of 25\n\nand a criminal history category of III.                 In this venue, the\n\nappellant does not challenge any of these rulings but, rather,\n\naccepts    the   district    court's     calculation     of    the      guideline\n\nsentencing range (GSR): 70-87 months.\n\n            During   the    sentencing      proceedings,      defense    counsel\n\nbriefly mentioned that the appellant was a former heroin addict\n\nwho, since committing the offense of conviction, had rehabilitated\n\nhimself.    This information led to the following exchange:\n\n            The Court: So what are you suggesting?\n\n            Defense Counsel: I'm suggesting that the Court\n            depart downward because this . . .\n\n            The Court: Absolutely not.          On the basis of\n            what?\n\nTo this question, defense counsel explicated, in some detail, that\n\nduring the years intervening between the offense conduct and the\n\narrest, the appellant had checked himself into a rehabilitation\n\nfacility, moved to Florida, forsook his criminal ways, and obtained\n\ngainful    employment.      Counsel    argued    that   these    developments\n\nsuggested that a below-the-range sentence would be an appropriate\n\noutcome.    The district court disagreed, stating:\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            I'm going to deny the role request that you're\n            making.    I am going to deny the departure\n            request you're going to make, and I'm going to\n            deny any other sentence than the advisory\n            guideline proposed here.\n                    There is nothing on this record under\n            3553(a) that moves me, moves me to consider\n            any other sentence than the sentence proposed\n            as advisory by the guidelines for cases like\n            this.\n\n            In the end, the court imposed a mid-range sentence of 78\n\nmonths in prison.        At the conclusion of the hearing, it asked\n\nwhether either side had \"[a]nything else?\"            The only rejoinder was\n\nfrom defense counsel, who requested that the sentence be served in\n\n\"the Tampa area.\"\n\n            In this appeal, the appellant argues that the sentencing\n\ncourt     committed     reversible     error    by     (i)   presuming    the\n\nreasonableness of the GSR; (ii) neglecting sufficiently to explain\n\nthe sentence imposed; and (iii) failing to consider mitigating\n\nfactors favoring a below-the-range sentence.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009) (per curiam), the appellant labors to\n\nconvince us that the court below transgressed this tenet.                In\n\nparticular, he assails the court's statement that it was \"going to\n\ndeny any other sentence than the advisory guideline proposed\" and\n\nits summary rejection of his entreaty to depart downward.            In the\n\nappellant's view, these actions demonstrate the sentencing court's\n\nembrace    of   the   very   presumption   of   reasonableness   that   Gall\n\nforbids.\n\n            We find this argument unpersuasive.         To begin, Nelson\n\ndoes not assist the appellant's cause.          There, the district court\n\nunequivocally declared at sentencing that \"the Guidelines are\n\nconsidered presumptively reasonable.\"           Id. at 891.      That was a\n\npatent violation of the tenet articulated in Gall.\n\n            The case at bar is at a considerable remove.           Here, the\n\nsentencing court made no such declaration. Although it declined to\n\naccept the appellant's proposal for a non-guideline sentence (24\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fmonths), it made that ruling only after hearing lengthy arguments\n\nas to whether and why the GSR should hold sway.                           The court\n\nconcluded that there was \"nothing on th[e] record\" that prompted it\n\n\"to consider any other sentence than the sentence proposed as\n\nadvisory by the guidelines.\"\n\n               There is a world of difference between according a\n\npresumption of reasonableness to the GSR — a practice that Gall\n\nforbids    —    and    finding    that   the     GSR,   in    a    particular    case,\n\nrepresents an appropriate sentencing range.                  This is a case of the\n\nlatter stripe.\n\n               Read as a whole, the sentencing transcript makes manifest\n\nnot only the court's awareness that the GSR was merely an initial\n\nbenchmark, but also its conclusion that the circumstances of the\n\ncase made it appropriate to hew to that benchmark in fashioning the\n\nappellant's sentence.            That was not error.              See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203365\"><a href=\"/opinion/203365/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 112 (1st Cir. 2008) (finding no\n\npresumption of reasonableness where the district court \"did not\n\nfeel bound to impose a sentence within the GSR\").\n\n               The appellant's next contention is that the district\n\ncourt failed adequately to explain its rationale for the sentence\n\nit imposed.        In this regard, the appellant invokes a statute\n\nproviding that, in a federal criminal case, a sentencing court must\n\n\"state    in    open   court     the   reasons    for   its       imposition    of   the\n\nparticular sentence.\"          18 U.S.C. § 3553(c).\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f                 We have recognized, however, that this directive must be\n\nread in a practical, common-sense way.                    The statutory directive\n\n\"does not mean that the sentencing court's explanation need be\n\nprecise to the point of pedantry.\"                     United States v. Turbides-\n\nLeonardo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202495\"><a href=\"/opinion/202495/united-states-v-turbides-leonardo/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 40 (1st Cir. 2006).                    In all events, \"with\n\nrespect to a sentencing court's duty of explanation, brevity is not\n\nto    be    confused    with     inattention.\"          Id.   at   41-42.     This   is\n\nespecially true where, as here, a court prescribes a sentence that\n\nfalls within the GSR.             See id. at 41; see also Rita v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145708\"><a href=\"/opinion/145708/rita-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 356-57 (2007) (\"[W]hen a judge decides simply\n\nto apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not\n\nnecessarily require lengthy explanation.\").                    Where, as here, the\n\nGSR has been correctly calculated and spans less than 24 months\n\nfrom bottom to top, a district court \"arguably is not required to\n\ncite       any   reasons   for    imposing       a    within-the-range      sentence.\"\n\nTurbides-Leonardo, 468 F.3d at 41 (emphasis in original).\n\n                 These principles are dispositive here.              Although it is\n\ntrue that the district court did not explicitly address each of the\n\nappellant's arguments for a below-the-range sentence, the court was\n\nnot required to offer that level of elucidation.                   See id. at 40-41.\n\nA    sentencing      court's     process    of       ratiocination   \"can    often   be\n\ninferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained\n\nin the pre-sentence report with what the judge did.\"                         Jiménez-\n\nBeltre, 440 F.3d at 519; see also Rita, 551 U.S. at 358 (holding\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\fthat where the sentencing court imposed a within-the-range sentence\n\nand the record indicates that the court heard the defendant's\n\narguments   and    considered   the    supporting      evidence,   it   may   be\n\ninferred    that   \"[t]he   judge     simply   found    the[]   circumstances\n\ninsufficient to warrant a sentence lower than the Guidelines\n\nrange\").\n\n            So it is here: we may infer from the protracted arguments\n\nand colloquy preceding the imposition of sentence that the court\n\nbelow considered all the arguments and evidence before settling\n\nupon an appropriate sentence. The court's clear pronouncement that\n\nthere was nothing in the record that warranted unusually favorable\n\ntreatment bolsters this inference.\n\n            As a subset of this argument, the appellant suggests that\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)(1) required more specificity. That suggestion,\n\nhowever, is grounded in a misreading of the statute.1                     This\n\nprovision applies only when the span of the GSR, measured from the\n\nlow end to the high end, is greater than 24 months.                See United\n\nStates v. Arango, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203021\"><a href=\"/opinion/203021/united-states-v-arango/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 44 (1st Cir. 2007); United States v.\n\nCirilo-Muñoz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 131 (1st Cir. 2007) (per curiam).\n\nHere, the sentencing range begins at 70 months and tops off at 87\n\nmonths. Simple arithmetic demonstrates that the spread between the\n\n\n\n     1\n       18 U.S.C. § 3553(c) provides in pertinent part that if the\nGSR \"exceeds 24 months,\" the court \"shall state in open court . . .\nthe reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the\nrange.\"\n\n                                      -11-\n\flow   and    high    ends    is   too   modest    to     trigger      the    statutory\n\nrequirement.\n\n             The appellant's final claim of error is that the district\n\ncourt failed to consider mitigating factors favoring a below-the-\n\nrange sentence.2           Specifically, he complains that he was less\n\nculpable     than      his    confederates,        and     that       he     undertook\n\nrehabilitative efforts of his own volition.                    These plaints lack\n\nforce.\n\n             Merely raising potentially mitigating factors does not\n\nguarantee a lesser sentence.            \"A criminal defendant is entitled to\n\na weighing of the section 3553(a) factors that are relevant to\n\n[his] case, not to a particular result.\"                 Carrasco-De-Jesús, 589\n\nF.3d at 29.\n\n             Here, the sentencing court heard about a myriad of\n\ncircumstances, including the appellant's relative culpability and\n\nefforts     at    rehabilitation.        The    court    determined         that   those\n\ncircumstances did not warrant the degree of leniency that the\n\nappellant        sought.     Although    the    court    did    not    specifically\n\nreference the factors that the appellant now highlights, the\n\nsentencing transcript, read as a whole, evinces a sufficient\n\nweighing of the section 3553(a) factors.                  See United States v.\n\n\n      2\n       The government urges us to deem this claim of error waived\nby reason of the cursory treatment given to it in the appellant's\nbrief.   See United States v.
