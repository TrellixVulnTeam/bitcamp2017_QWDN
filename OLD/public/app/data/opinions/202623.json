McGaughey, Appellate Chief, and Paula D. Silsby,\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\fFebruary 6, 2007\n\f                 Per Curiam.        Dung Vu and Dung Le--co-conspirators in a\n\ndrug       trafficking       operation         that    brought     crack    cocaine     from\n\nMassachusetts to Maine for local distribution, see generally United\n\nStates      v.    Dung   Cao,       471   F.3d    1     (1st    Cir.   2006)    (affirming\n\nconviction         and   sentence         of    another        co-conspirator      in   that\n\noperation)--appeal            from        their       sentences.           After    careful\n\nconsideration of the parties' briefs and the underlying record, we\n\naffirm both defendants' sentences for the reasons discussed below.\n\n                 Dung Vu challenges his mandatory minimum sentence on the\n\nsole ground that the applicable statute, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A),\n\nviolates his equal protection or due process rights1 by imposing\n\nthe same mandatory minimum penalty for crimes involving crack\n\ncocaine as for crimes involving 100 times the amount of powder\n\ncocaine. We have repeatedly rejected that argument, United States\n\nv. Berrios, 132 F.3d 834, 842 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v.\n\nGraciani,        61   F.3d    70,    75    (1st       Cir.   1995);    United   States    v.\n\nSingleterry, 29 F.3d 733, 740 (1st Cir. 1994); and \"[u]ntil the en\n\nbanc court of this circuit, the U.S. Supreme Court, or Congress\n\nitself . . . finds [this disparity] untenable, [such] challenges .\n\n. . will continue to fail,\" Berrios, 132 F.3d at 842; see also\n\nGraciani, 61 F.3d at 75.\n\n\n\n       1\n      In the district court Dung Vu framed his challenge in terms\nof equal protection, while in this court he relies on due process.\nAs he acknowledges, however, the standard is the same in either\ncase. See Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 464-65 (1991).\n\n                                                -3-\n\f             Dung Le challenges her sentence on the ground that the\n\ndistrict court erred in applying a four-level enhancement to her\n\nbase offense level based on its finding that she was an \"organizer\n\nor   leader\"   of   the   conspiracy   within   the   meaning   of   USSG   §\n\n3B1.1(a).2     We review that fact-sensitive finding only for clear\n\nerror.    United States v. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d 146, 148 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n             In making that finding, the district court expressly\n\nrelied upon \"the facts set forth in the presentence investigation\n\nreport, which [it] accept[ed]; the results of the wiretap, which\n\n[it had] heard; [and] the activities involving the direct sales of\n\ndrugs and [Dung Le's] part in those.\" In addition, the government,\n\nwhich had the burden of justifying the role enhancement, United\n\nStates v. Picanso, 333 F.3d 21, 23 (1st Cir. 2003), pointed to\n\nother evidence in the transcripts of co-defendant Dung Cao's trial,\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      On appeal, she also argues that the court erred in concluding\nthat the criminal activity involved \"five or more participants or\nwas otherwise extensive,\" another prerequisite for applying the\nsame enhancement. USSG § 3B1.1(a). However, by not raising that\nargument below, she forfeited all but plain error review on that\nground, United States v. Connolly, 341 F.3d 16, 30 (1st Cir. 2003).\nThe district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, in finding\nthat criterion to be satisfied.     The record is clear that the\nconspiracy involved at least the six individuals named in the\nindictment and was also \"extensive\" in terms of its duration (more\nthan one year), the amount of drugs involved (50 grams or more of\ncrack cocaine), and its geographic reach (from Massachusetts to\nMaine). See United States v. Thiongo, 344 F.3d 55, 62-63 (1st Cir.\n2003).\n\n                                   -4-\n\fco-defendant Sang Tran's sentencing, and the suppression hearing,\n\nover which the same judge presided.\n\n                 Dung Le objects to the district court's reliance on\n\nanything         but    the    undisputed    facts    in   the   presentence    report\n\n(\"PSR\"), the facts in the prosecution's version that she admitted\n\nwhen       she    pled    guilty,    and     the    evidence     introduced    at   the\n\nsuppression hearing (which included tape-recordings and transcripts\n\nof the results of the wiretap of Dung Le's telephone).                              Her\n\nobjections         to    the    court's     other    sources     of   information   are\n\nunfounded.\n\n                 Even where a defendant objects to facts in a PSR, the\n\ndistrict court is entitled to rely on the objected-to facts if the\n\ndefendant's objections \"'are merely rhetorical and unsupported by\n\ncountervailing proof.'\" United States v. Prochner, 417 F.3d 54, 66\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (quoting United States v. Cyr, 337 F.3d 96, 100\n\n(1st Cir. 2003)); see also United States v. Grant, 114 F.3d 323,\n\n328 (1st Cir. 1997).3            Here, although Dung Le objected to the PSR's\n\nconclusion that she was a leader or organizer and also denied some\n\nof the subsidiary facts, she produced no evidence to the contrary.\n\n\"In the absence of rebuttal evidence beyond defendant's self-\n\n\n\n       3\n      Dung Le asks us to reconsider these precedents in light of\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005). Even if this panel\nwere empowered to do so, see Berrios, 132 F.3d at 842, we would\ndecline. Booker did not alter the district court's fact-finding\nauthority. United States v. Pizarro-Berríos, 448 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\nCir. 2006). Indeed, Prochner itself was decided post-Booker.\n\n                                             -5-\n\fserving words,\" the district court did not clearly err in relying\n\non the facts in the PSR.             Prochner, 417 F.3d at 66.           Moreover, to\n\nthe extent that the district court implicitly resolved the disputed\n\nfacts in the government's favor, as it was also entitled to do,\n\nGrant,   114     F.3d    at     66    n.9,    its    \"choice    among     supportable\n\nalternatives cannot be clearly erroneous,\" United States v. Ruiz,\n\n905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n           The       district    court       did    not    expressly     rely    on   the\n\ntranscripts     of    co-defendant       Dung      Cao's    trial   or    Sang    Tran's\n\nsentencing.      However, to the extent it did so implicitly, it was\n\nentitled   to    rely    on   the     evidence      presented    at    those     related\n\nproceedings, over which the same judge presided, United States v.\n\nCanada, 960 F.2d 263, 268 (1st Cir. 1992), particularly since Dung\n\nLe had prior notice, via the government's sentencing memorandum,\n\nthat the government intended to rely on evidence from the former\n\nproceeding, and defense counsel was present at the latter. See id.\n\n(distinguishing United States v. Berzon, 941 F.2d 8 (1st Cir.\n\n1991), on which Dung Le relies, on these grounds).\n\n           As a fall-back argument, Dung Le contends that her trial\n\ncounsel was ineffective in failing to request a transcript of Dung\n\nCao's trial prior to sentencing, so that he could point to evidence\n\nfrom that transcript to demonstrate Dung Le's lack of a leadership\n\nrole.    That argument is premature in this direct appeal, United\n\nStates v. Medina, 427 F.3d 88, 90 (1st Cir. 2005), and is unlikely\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\fto succeed in any event.         Even if Dung Le could show that her\n\ncounsel's failure to request the transcript fell below an objective\n\nstandard of reasonableness, Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,\n\n687 (1984), it is doubtful that she could show the necessary\n\nprejudice, id.      Even with the benefit of the transcript, her\n\nappellate counsel has identified only one minor discrepancy between\n\nthe government's characterization of the trial evidence and the\n\ntranscript itself and two instances where co-conspirators acted\n\nindependently.     We doubt that this evidence would have changed the\n\ncourt's view--based on the other evidence it considered--that Dung\n\nLe's role as a leader or organizer was \"abundantly clear.\"\n\n            That   conclusion    is   amply    supported    by   the   record\n\nevidence.    In sum, that evidence showed that, among other tasks,\n\nDung Le made arrangements to purchase the crack in Massachusetts,\n\nrecruited and supervised runners to pick up and distribute it,\n\nrepackaged it in smaller amounts for distribution, handled most of\n\nthe negotiations over amounts and prices, and arranged for sales to\n\nundercover agents and others.\n\n            That array of responsibilities was sufficient to warrant\n\na leadership enhancement under USSG § 3B1.1(a).            See id., comment.\n\n(n.2)   (listing   among   the   relevant     factors,   \"the    exercise   of\n\ndecision making authority, the nature of participation in the\n\ncommission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, . . .\n\nthe degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense,\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f. . . . and the degree of control and authority exercised over\n\nothers\"); see also, e.g., United States v. Casas, 356 F.3d 104, 129\n\n(1st Cir. 2004); United States v. Ventura, 353 F.3d 84, 89 (1st\n\nCir. 2003); Berrios, 132 F.3d at 839.        Although, at times, Dung Le\n\nperformed    some   lower-level   tasks     herself     and   others   shared\n\nleadership responsibility or acted independently, those facts do\n\nnot render her ineligible for a leadership enhancement.                \"There\n\ncan, of course, be more than one person who qualifies as a leader\n\nor organizer of a criminal association or conspiracy.\"                 USSG §\n\n3B1.1, cmt. (n.4); see also Ventura, 353 F.3d at 89-90.\n\n            Accordingly,   finding    no   error   in   either   defendant's\n\nsentence, we affirm both sentences.        See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f",

Even with the benefit of the transcript, her\n\nappellate counsel has identified only one minor discrepancy between\n\nthe government's characterization of the trial evidence and the\n\ntranscript itself and two instances where co-conspirators acted\n\nindependently.     We doubt that this evidence would have changed the\n\ncourt's view--based on the other evidence it considered--that Dung\n\nLe's role as a leader or organizer was \"abundantly clear.\"\n\n            That   conclusion    is   amply    supported    by   the   record\n\nevidence.    In sum, that evidence showed that, among other tasks,\n\nDung Le made arrangements to purchase the crack in Massachusetts,\n\nrecruited and supervised runners to pick up and distribute it,\n\nrepackaged it in smaller amounts for distribution, handled most of\n\nthe negotiations over amounts and prices, and arranged for sales to\n\nundercover agents and others.\n\n            That array of responsibilities was sufficient to warrant\n\na leadership enhancement under USSG § 3B1.1(a).
