Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Fernando E. Agrait, with whom Orlando H. Martínez-Echeverría\nwas on brief, for appellants.\n     Doraliz E. Ortiz-de-León, Assistant Solicitor General, with\nwhom Roberto J. Sánchez Ramos, Solicitor General, Kenneth Pamias\nVelázquez, Deputy Solicitor General, and Camelia Fernández-Romeu,\nOffice of the Solicitor General, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                          April 19, 2005\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.           In this appeal, the plaintiffs\n\nchallenge   the   district   court's       dismissal    of   their    complaint,\n\nbrought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for failure to state a claim upon\n\nwhich relief might be granted.        After careful consideration of the\n\nbriefs and the record, we conclude that the most recent incident\n\ndescribed in the complaint was not actionable; that the earlier\n\nincidents fell outside the limitations period; and, therefore, that\n\nthe district court properly dismissed the complaint.\n\n                                      I.\n\n                                Background\n\n            Beginning   in   1993,    the    Commonwealth     of     Puerto   Rico\n\nembarked on a process of privatizing its extensive network of\n\npublic health facilities.      That effort provides the backdrop for\n\nthis litigation.\n\n            On November 22, 1999, plaintiffs-appellants Centro Medico\n\ndel Turabo, Inc., Turabo Medical Center Partnership, Hospital\n\nInteramericano    de    Medicina     Avanzada    de    Humacao,    and   Joaquín\n\nRodríguez García (Rodríguez) filed a civil action against Carmen\n\nFeliciano de Melecio (the Commonwealth's Secretary of Health). The\n\ncomplaint charged that, between 1993 and 1999, the Secretary had\n\nrefused to grant certificates of necessity and convenience required\n\nto develop certain medical facilities at two of the plaintiffs'\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fhospitals,1 denied them permission to transfer a license from one\n\nhospital to another, and awarded contracts for the purchase, lease,\n\nand/or    administration      of    various    public   health    facilities   to\n\nentities not affiliated with the plaintiffs. The complaint further\n\nalleged    that   these    acts     and   omissions      were    discriminatory,\n\ntransgressed      due   process,      denied    the     plaintiffs   the    equal\n\nprotection of the laws, and were taken in retaliation for the\n\nplaintiffs' exercise of their First Amendment rights (i.e., their\n\npersistent challenges to various of the Secretary's actions in the\n\nlocal courts).     The suit sought both damages and injunctive relief\n\nto redress these alleged constitutional harms.\n\n            The Secretary filed a motion to dismiss, arguing, inter\n\nalia, that the statute of limitations had run.                   The plaintiffs\n\nrejoined that the described incidents comprised an interrelated\n\nseries of constitutional violations, one of which occurred within\n\nthe limitations period, and, thus, that the \"continuing violation\"\n\ndoctrine    salvaged    all    of    their    claims.     The    district   court\n\ndisagreed and granted the motion to dismiss. See Centro Medico del\n\nTurabo v. Feliciano de Melecio, 321 F. Supp. 2d 285 (D.P.R. 2004).\n\n            In pertinent part, the district court concluded that the\n\ncomplaint, on its face, demonstrated that the plaintiffs were aware\n\nas early as 1996 of the need to assert their rights in response to\n\n\n     1\n      The plaintiffs are related parties, controlled in the final\nanalysis by Rodríguez. The precise relationships among them are\nnot relevant to the issues on appeal.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fthe Secretary's actions, but nevertheless failed seasonably to\n\ninvoke section 1983.          See id. at 292.    The court then focused on\n\nthe   one    timeous    incident     described   in   the   complaint    —   the\n\nSecretary's contractual assignment of the Caguas Regional Hospital\n\n(CRH) to the control of a medical school, Escuela de Ciencias\n\nMedícas San Juan Bautista (San Juan Bautista), in July of 1999 —\n\nand   concluded        that   the    circumstances    there     were    neither\n\nsufficiently similar to those underlying the time-barred claims to\n\njustify treating it as a continuation of the earlier episodes nor\n\nindependently sufficient to ground a cognizable constitutional\n\nclaim.      See id. at 292-94.      This appeal ensued.\n\n                                       II.\n\n                                    Discussion\n\n              In this venue, the plaintiffs argue that the 1999 grant\n\nto San Juan Bautista of the right to administer CRH was one in a\n\nseries   of    discriminatory       actions   taken   against   them    by   the\n\nSecretary; that the 1999 incident falls within the limitations\n\nperiod; and that the events underlying the time-barred claims are\n\nso substantially related to that incident that the entire series of\n\nclaims should be deemed timely filed under the continuing violation\n\ndoctrine.      We limn the standard of review, chart the contours of\n\nthe pertinent legal landscape, and then turn to the plaintiffs'\n\nargument.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f                                       A.\n\n                             Standard of Review\n\n            The court below dismissed the plaintiffs' action for\n\nfailure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).                We review\n\nthat determination de novo, adhering to the same criteria that\n\nbound the lower court.        In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp., 324\n\nF.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).         The tools of this trade include the\n\ncomplaint, documents annexed to it or fairly incorporated into it,\n\nand matters susceptible to judicial notice.               Rodi v. S. New Eng.\n\nSch. of Law, 389 F.3d 5, 12 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            In a civil rights case, there is no heightened pleading\n\nstandard.    Educadores Puertorriqueños en Acción v. Hernández, 367\n\nF.3d 61, 66-67 (1st Cir. 2004).                Therefore, a district court\n\ncharged with the adjudication of a motion to dismiss under Rule\n\n12(b)(6) must apply the notice pleading requirements of Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 8(a)(2).    Rivera v. Rhode Island, 402 F.3d 27, 33 (1st Cir.\n\n2005); Educadores, 367 F.3d at 66.              A complaint satisfies that\n\nstandard if it contains \"a short and plain statement of the claim\n\nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\" Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n8(a)(2), and     \"give[s]    the    defendant    fair     notice   of   what   the\n\nplaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,\"                Conley\n\nv. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957).\n\n            In   measuring   a     complaint    against    this    benchmark,    a\n\nreviewing court must \"assume the truth of all well-pleaded facts\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fand indulge all reasonable inferences that fit the plaintiff's\n\nstated theory of liability.\"    Colonial Mortg. Bankers, 324 F.3d at\n\n15.   Still, such a court is not bound to credit \"bald assertions,\n\nunsupportable conclusions, periphrastic circumlocutions, and the\n\nlike.\"    Aulson v. Blanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            Once the court has performed this tamisage, dismissal for\n\nfailure to state a claim will be appropriate if the pleadings fail\n\nto set forth \"factual allegations, either direct or inferential,\n\nrespecting each material element necessary to sustain recovery\n\nunder some actionable legal theory.\" Berner v. Delahanty, 129 F.3d\n\n20, 25 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d\n\n513, 515 (1st Cir. 1988) (internal quotation marks omitted)).        We\n\nwill affirm a dismissal only if it is transparently clear that the\n\ncomplaint, in light of the facts alleged, engenders no viable\n\ntheory of liability. Educadores, 367 F.3d at 66; Blackstone Realty\n\nLLC v. FDIC, 244 F.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            Under this rubric, it is sometimes permissible to grant\n\na motion to dismiss based on an affirmative defense, such as the\n\nstatute    of   limitations.   That    happens   \"when   the   pleader's\n\nallegations leave no doubt that an asserted claim is time-barred.\"\n\nLaChapelle v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., 142 F.3d 507, 509 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).    This is the test that we apply here.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f                                    B.\n\n                        The Limitations Period\n\n             Section 1983 creates a private right of action for\n\nredressing     abridgments   or   deprivations   of    federally   assured\n\nrights.2    Cox v. Hainey, 391 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 2004); McIntosh\n\nv. Antonino, 71 F.3d 29, 33 (1st Cir. 1995).          Because it does not\n\ncontain a built-in limitations period, a federal court adjudicating\n\na section 1983 action must borrow the forum state's general statute\n\nof limitations for personal injury actions.           Owens v. Okure, 488\n\nU.S. 235, 240-41, 249-50 (1989); Nieves v. McSweeney, 241 F.3d 46,\n\n51 (1st Cir. 2001).      In Puerto Rico, the limitations period for\n\ninjuries to the person is one year.          See 31 P.R. Laws Ann. §\n\n5298(2).      Accordingly, that term applies here.        See Rodríguez-\n\nGarcia v. Municipality of Caguas, 354 F.3d 91, 96 (1st Cir. 2004);\n\nRivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 353 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).\n\n\n\n\n     2\n         That statute provides in pertinent part:\n\n     Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance,\n     regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory\n     or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be\n     subjected, any citizen of the United States or other\n     person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation\n     of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the\n     Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party\n     injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other\n     proper proceeding for redress.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f           Puerto Rico's one-year limitations period begins to run\n\none day after the date of accrual.       See Carreras-Rosa v. Alves-\n\nCruz, 127 F.3d 172, 175 (1st Cir. 1997) (per curiam).      The accrual\n\ndate, however, is determined in accordance with federal law.\n\nRivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d at 353.      In a section 1983 case, a claim\n\nordinarily accrues \"when the plaintiff knows, or has reason to\n\nknow, of the injury on which the action is based.\"       Id.; see also\n\nNieves-Márquez v. Puerto Rico, 353 F.3d 108, 119-20 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(noting that a claim accrues \"when facts supportive of a civil\n\nrights action are or should be apparent to a reasonably prudent\n\nperson similarly situated\" (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)).\n\n           Here, the plaintiffs do not dispute that they knew, or\n\nhad reason to know, of their injuries immediately following the\n\noccurrence of each of the various incidents.            It is likewise\n\nundisputed that the only stand-alone claim of injury that falls\n\nchronologically within the limitations period is the claim relating\n\nto   the   Secretary's   July   1999    transfer   of   administrative\n\nresponsibility over CRH to San Juan Bautista.           The plaintiffs\n\nnevertheless seek to salvage their earlier claims by bringing them\n\nunder the umbrella of the continuing violation doctrine.       To that\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fend, they allege that the CRH contretemps was part of a long-\n\nrunning serial violation.3\n\n            Under the serial violation branch of the continuing\n\nviolation doctrine, a plaintiff may link a number of discriminatory\n\nacts emanating from the same discriminatory animus, even though\n\neach act constitutes a separate wrong.        See Provencher v. CVS\n\nPharmacy, 145 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir. 1998); Jensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d\n\n517, 522 (1st Cir. 1990).    If the plaintiff can forge that link and\n\ncan also show that at least one act in the series occurred within\n\nthe limitations period, the suit may be considered timely as to all\n\nthe acts.   See Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co., 101 F.3d 218,\n\n221-22 (1st Cir. 1996); Kassaye v. Bryant Coll., 999 F.2d 603, 606\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).\n\n            In order for the serial violation theory to apply, the\n\nact that falls within the limitations period must itself constitute\n\nan actionable violation.      Lawton, 101 F.3d 222 (\"Common sense\n\nteaches that a plaintiff cannot resuscitate time-barred acts, said\n\nto be discriminatory, by the simple expedient of linking them to a\n\nnon-identical, non-discriminatory, non-time barred act.\"); Muniz-\n\nCabrero v. Ruiz, 23 F.3d 607, 610-11 (1st Cir. 1994) (refusing to\n\n\n\n     3\n      The continuing violation doctrine encompasses both serial\nviolations and systemic violations. Jensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d 517,\n522 (1st Cir. 1990). The plaintiffs have not alleged a systemic\nviolation. See Centro Medico del Turabo, 321 F. Supp. 2d at 292;\nsee also Appellants' Br. at 10 (accepting the district court's\ndetermination that no systemic violation was alleged).\n\n                                  -9-\n\fapply the serial violation theory when the plaintiff had failed to\n\nshow that the timely acts were \"separate and actionable § 1983\n\nviolations\"); Mack v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 183\n\n(1st Cir. 1989) (stating that the plaintiff \"retain[s] the burden\n\nof demonstrating that some discriminatory act transpired within the\n\nappropriate time frame\").             It follows inexorably that if the\n\nplaintiffs have failed to state an independently actionable claim\n\nbased on the CRH incident, they cannot rely on that incident to\n\nanchor the rest of their claims (each of which arose out of events\n\nthat occurred well prior to November 21, 1998 — the earliest day\n\nwithin the limitations period).               Consequently, we examine that\n\nclaim before proceeding further.\n\n                                        C.\n\n                           The July 1999 Incident\n\n             In their complaint and their brief, the plaintiffs have\n\nproposed, without meaningful elaboration, that the assignment to\n\nSan   Juan   Bautista     of    the   right   to   administer   CRH's     affairs\n\ncontravened       their   due   process,      equal   protection,   and    First\n\nAmendment rights.         We address each of these suggested bases for\n\nliability.\n\n             1.    Procedural Due Process.         The plaintiffs have made a\n\ngeneral suggestion that the Secretary's failure to award them the\n\nright to purchase, lease, or manage CRH violated due process.                  To\n\nthe extent that they hope to maintain a procedural due process\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fclaim, they must first point to a protected liberty or property\n\ninterest.       Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569 (1972) (\"The\n\nrequirements         of   procedural         due     process         apply       only      to    the\n\ndeprivation of interests encompassed by the Fourteenth Amendment's\n\nprotection      of    liberty       and     property.\").            There    is       no   liberty\n\ninterest implicated here,4 so the plaintiffs' claim stands or\n\nfalls,     in     the     first       instance,           on       the   existence          of    a\n\nconstitutionally protected property interest.\n\n             In      order     to    establish       a    constitutionally              protected\n\nproperty interest, the plaintiffs must identify a \"legitimate claim\n\nof   entitlement\"         to    the       property       in    question      —    a     claim    of\n\nentitlement          created        and     defined           by    \"existing         rules       or\n\nunderstandings that stem from an independent source such as state\n\nlaw.\"     Id. at 577.        For this purpose, \"an abstract need or desire\"\n\nor a \"unilateral expectation\" are not sufficient to cement a\n\nconstitutionally protected interest.                      Id.\n\n             The plaintiffs allege that, on two occasions, they wrote\n\nto the Secretary to express an interest in purchasing, leasing, or\n\nmanaging CRH.          That is not enough:                they have wholly failed to\n\nidentify any legally cognizable property interest in acquiring a\n\n\n      4\n      To invoke a liberty interest, the plaintiffs would have to\nidentify \"a right or status previously recognized by state law\n[that] was distinctly altered or extinguished\" by state action.\nPaul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 711 (1976); see also Johnson v.\nRodriguez, 943 F.2d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 1991). They have made no\neffort to convince us that any such right or status is implicated\nhere, and we can think of none.\n\n                                             -11-\n\fright to purchase, lease, manage, or otherwise participate in the\n\nprivatization of CRH.      Puerto Rico law governing the Department of\n\nHealth's authority to grant contracts for the privatization of\n\npublicly-owned health care facilities dispels any doubt.               The\n\nstatutory scheme not only explicitly allows the Secretary to award\n\nsuch contracts to medical schools without following the usual\n\nbidding    protocol     but   also    directs   that   she    prefer   such\n\ninstitutions.      See 24 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 3322, 3306.      These statutes\n\nmake it pellucid that the plaintiffs had no legally cognizable\n\nright to vie for the CRH contract on an equal footing with San Juan\n\nBautista, let alone an entitlement to have that contract awarded to\n\nthem rather than to a medical school.       The short of it is that the\n\nplaintiffs had nothing more than a unilateral desire to secure a\n\nstake in CRH's privatization. The frustration of such a subjective\n\ndesire is a far cry from the deprivation of a constitutionally\n\nprotected property interest.          For this reason, the plaintiffs'\n\nprocedural due process claim fails.\n\n           2.      Substantive Due Process.       Next, the plaintiffs\n\ncontend that the Secretary's awarding of a contract to San Juan\n\nBautista     was      \"[a]rbitrary,     capricious,     unfounded,     and\n\ndiscriminatory,\" thus violating their right to substantive due\n\nprocess.   This contention rings hollow.\n\n           The Fourteenth Amendment protects against deprivation of\n\nlife, liberty, or property without due process of law.            See U.S.\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fConst. amend XIV.          The substantive component of this guarantee\n\nguards     against   \"certain      government   actions   regardless       of   the\n\nfairness of the procedures used to implement them.\"                 Daniels v.\n\nWilliams, 474 U.S. 327, 331 (1986). In the substantive due process\n\ncontext (as in the procedural due process context), a plaintiff, as\n\na condition precedent to stating a valid claim, must exhibit a\n\nconstitutionally protected interest in life, liberty, or property.\n\nSee Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 722 (1997); Rivera, 402\n\nF.3d at 33-34; Macone v. Town of Wakefield, 277 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n2002). As explained above, see supra Part II(C)(1), the plaintiffs\n\nhave failed to identify such an interest.                 Consequently, their\n\nsubstantive due process claim founders.\n\n             3. Equal Protection. The plaintiffs asseverate that the\n\nSecretary's grant of the CRH contract to San Juan Bautista denied\n\nthem   a    fair   shake    in    the   potentially   lucrative    process       of\n\nprivatization of public health facilities, in violation of the\n\nEqual Protection Clause.            This asseveration is frivolous.             The\n\nplaintiffs failed, even when pressed at oral argument, to position\n\ntheir claim within the familiar equal protection framework:                     they\n\nhave not claimed membership in a protected class or demonstrated\n\nthat other entities, similarly situated, were treated differently\n\nconcerning the award of hospital contracts.               Their inability to\n\nidentify     these   doctrinal      rudiments   is    fatal   to   their    equal\n\nprotection challenge.            See Barrington Cove Ltd. P'ship v. R.I.\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fHous. & Mortg. Fin. Corp., 246 F.3d 1, 7-10 (1st Cir. 2001);\n\nHennessy v. City of Melrose, 194 F.3d 237, 244 (1st Cir. 1999);\n\nGilbert v. City of Cambridge, 932 F.2d 51, 66 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          4.   First Amendment.   The plaintiffs' last-gasp claim is\n\nthat the award of the CRH contract to an unrelated entity was part\n\nof a \"punitive campaign\" to retaliate against them for availing\n\nthemselves of commonwealth court remedies following the Secretary's\n\ndenial of their applications for certain hospital permits.       The\n\nSupreme Court has made it plain that \"even though a person has no\n\n'right' to a valuable governmental benefit and even though the\n\ngovernment may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons,\n\nthere are some reasons upon which the government may not rely.\"\n\nPerry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972).      The exercise of\n\nFirst Amendment rights is among the constitutionally proscribed\n\nreasons for the denial of a government benefit.   Id.   Thus, we have\n\nrecognized, as a general matter, that \"[c]laims of retaliation for\n\nthe exercise of First Amendment rights are cognizable under §\n\n1983.\"   Powell v. Alexander, 391 F.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           It is an open question, however, whether First Amendment\n\nretaliation claims presented by disappointed bidders or applicants\n\nfor new government contracts are cognizable.      In Board of County\n\nCommissioners v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 673 (1996), the Court held\n\nthat First Amendment protections extend to independent contractors\n\nalleging termination or prevention of automatic renewal of at-will\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fgovernment contracts in retaliation for the exercise of the freedom\n\nof speech.    On that basis, the Court held that a person so situated\n\ncould state a valid cause of action under section 1983.           See id. at\n\n686.   In so holding, the Justices \"emphasize[d] the limited nature\n\nof [their] decision,\" which concerned only \"the termination of a\n\npre-existing commercial relationship with the government,\" and,\n\naccordingly, declined to address \"the possibility of suits by\n\nbidders or applicants for new government contracts who cannot rely\n\non such a relationship.\"      Id. at 685.\n\n             Following    Umbehr   and    a   closely   related    decision\n\nrecognizing     similar    protections    for   independent   contractors\n\nalleging politically motivated discrimination, see O'Hare Truck\n\nServ., Inc. v. City of Northlake, 518 U.S. 712, 714-15 (1996), we\n\nhave acknowledged this uncertainty, observing that \"[t]he next area\n\nof contest appears to revolve around those who wish for the first\n\ntime to bid for government contracts.\" Prisma Zona Exploratoria v.\n\nCalderon, 310 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2002).        In Prisma Zona, however,\n\nwe found it unnecessary to resolve that question, see id. — and we\n\nhave the same luxury today.\n\n             Even assuming, for argument's sake, that an entity that\n\nhas no preexisting contractual relationship with the Commonwealth\n\ncan state a claim under section 1983 for an allegedly retaliatory\n\ndenial of a bid, we nevertheless find that the plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to state a valid retaliation claim because they have not\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fidentified any action taken against them by the Secretary in\n\nconnection with the privatization of CRH, whether in the form of an\n\nactual denial of a bid or an improper refusal to consider an\n\napplication.   To the contrary, the Secretary, in accordance with\n\nher authority under 24 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 3306, 3322, never issued\n\nan invitation for bids.   Consequently, the plaintiffs' status does\n\nnot rise to that of disappointed bidders, and the grant of the CRH\n\ncontract to San Juan Bautista cannot be characterized as an action\n\ntaken against them so as to satisfy the threshold requirement of\n\nalleging a retaliatory decision.      We explain briefly.\n\n          If the protections recognized in Umbehr were to extend to\n\nunsolicited bids for new government contracts — a matter on which\n\nwe take no view — establishing a First Amendment retaliation claim\n\nwould necessitate a showing \"that [the plaintiff's] conduct was\n\nconstitutionally   protected,   and     that   this   conduct   was   a\n\n'substantial factor' [or] . . . a 'motivating factor'\" driving the\n\nallegedly retaliatory decision. Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of\n\nEduc. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977).      Even so, the defendant\n\ncould then avoid a finding of liability by way of the so-called Mt.\n\nHealthy defense, which requires a showing that \"it would have\n\nreached the same decision . . . even in the absence of the\n\nprotected conduct.\"   Id.; see also Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 685.\n\n          In this case, the plaintiffs have alleged that, on three\n\noccasions occurring in 1996 and 1997, they successfully appealed\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fdenials of applications for hospital licenses.        As a general\n\nmatter, this type of conduct — seeking to avail oneself of judicial\n\nremedies — is constitutionally protected.    See Powell, 391 F.3d at\n\n17.   Thus, we assume that the plaintiffs have stated the first\n\nmaterial element of a retaliation claim.\n\n          That is about as far as the allegations of the complaint\n\ntake the plaintiffs.     Although they have shown constitutionally\n\nprotected conduct, they have failed to identify any retaliatory\n\ndecision made by the Secretary, within the limitations period, in\n\nresponse to that conduct.\n\n          The complaint provides no support for the contention that\n\nthe Secretary's grant of a contract to administer CRH to San Juan\n\nBautista was connected in any way to the plaintiffs, let alone to\n\ntheir earlier court activities.        The Secretary, pursuant to a\n\nstatutory preference that the plaintiffs do not challenge, elected\n\nto award the contract to an accredited medical school without\n\nconducting an open application process.     At no point did she deny\n\nany application or bid submitted by the plaintiffs. By like token,\n\nthe grant to San Juan Bautista did not involve any omission on the\n\npart of the Secretary:    she was not required to extend a request\n\nfor bids; the plaintiffs had no constitutionally protected interest\n\nin participating in such a process; and, therefore, the failure to\n\nrespond to the plaintiffs' unsolicited notices of interest cannot\n\nplausibly be characterized as the neglect of an obligation owed to\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fthe plaintiffs. In the absence of some action directed against the\n\nplaintiffs or some omission that diminishes a constitutionally\n\nprotected interest or entitlement, the Secretary's conduct cannot\n\nbe said to have been taken against the plaintiffs.     See LaRou v.\n\nRidlon, 98 F.3d 659, 662-63 (1st Cir. 1996) (finding that the\n\ndecision to post a job listing without first making offer to\n\nplaintiff was not retaliatory because defendant had no obligation\n\nto give preference to the plaintiff).\n\n          Even   if   the   Secretary's   action   could,    by   some\n\nthaumaturgical feat, be characterized as one directed against the\n\nplaintiffs (rather than one that merely has an incidental effect on\n\nan unprotected interest), the plaintiffs would have to show that\n\nthe adverse action was substantially attributable to the exercise\n\nof their rights of appeal and not to some other (unrelated) reason.\n\nSee Mihos v. Swift, 358 F.3d 91, 108 (1st Cir. 2004).       Other than\n\nmaking a vague mention of the \"timing of the acts\" and a conclusory\n\nreference to the defendant's \"hostility,\" the plaintiffs have not\n\nmade any allegation that their earlier recourse to the Puerto Rico\n\ncourts was a substantial or motivating factor in the Secretary's\n\ndecision to award the CRH contract to San Juan Bautista.5\n\n\n     5\n      In point of fact, the lapse of time between the exercise of\nthe plaintiffs' rights of appeal and the Secretary's allegedly\nretaliatory action (roughly two years) undercuts rather than\nsupports the plaintiffs' effort to demonstrate a causal connection.\nAlthough close temporal proximity between two events may give rise\nto an inference of causal connection, see, e.g., Lewis v. City of\nBoston, 321 F.3d 207, 219 (1st Cir. 2003), intervals similar to the\n\n                                -18-\n\f          Moreover, the record establishes that, even without the\n\nprotected activity, the same result would have obtained.     After\n\nall, the Secretary, on this occasion, took no action against the\n\nplaintiffs.   She was mandated by law to prefer medical schools in\n\nthe awarding of hospital contracts — and that is precisely what she\n\ndid.\n\n          To recapitulate, we conclude that the plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to state a constitutionally cognizable claim related to the\n\nJuly 1999 contract award.   Because that incident cannot support an\n\nactionable claim under section 1983, it cannot anchor the remainder\n\nof the plaintiffs' (time-barred) claims.     See Muniz-Cabrero, 23\n\nF.3d at 610-11.   Thus, we do not reach the question of whether the\n\nother criteria necessary for a serial violation claim are satisfied\n\nhere.\n\n                                III.\n\n                            Conclusion\n\n          We need go no further.    Concluding, as we do, that the\n\ncomplaint fails to state a cause of action upon which section 1983\n\n\n\none involved here are simply too long to support such an inference,\nsee, e.g., id. (noting that the passage of eighteen months between\nthe protected conduct and the allegedly retaliatory action undercut\nthe temporal proximity argument); Dressler v. Daniel, 315 F.3d 75,\n79-80 (1st Cir. 2003) (finding causal connection tenuous because of\npassage of two years); Lewis v. Gillette Co., 22 F.3d 22, 25 (1st\nCir. 1994) (finding that lapse of two years undermined inference);\nsee also Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 828 (1st Cir.\n1991) (holding that nine-month period between relevant events\nweakened any inference of causation).\n\n                                -19-\n\frelief can be granted, we affirm the district court's order of\n\ndismissal.\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -20-\n\f",

The complaint charged that, between 1993 and 1999, the Secretary had refused to grant certificates of necessity and convenience required to develop certain medical facilities at two of the plaintiffs' hospitals,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> denied them permission to transfer a license from one hospital to another, and awarded contracts for the purchase, lease, and/or administration of various public health facilities to entities not affiliated with the plaintiffs. The complaint further alleged that these acts and omissions were discriminatory, transgressed due process, denied the plaintiffs the equal protection of the laws, and were taken in retaliation for the plaintiffs' exercise of their First Amendment rights (i.e., their persistent challenges to various of the Secretary's actions in the local courts).

The district court disagreed and granted the motion to dismiss. <i>See Centro Medico Del Turabo v.

The court then focused on the one timeous incident described in the complaint&#8212;the Secretary's contractual assignment of the Caguas Regional Hospital (CRH) to the control of a medical school, Escuela de Ciencias Med&#237;cas San Juan Bautista (San Juan Bautista), in July of 1999&#8212;and concluded that the circumstances there were neither sufficiently similar to those underlying the time-barred claims to justify treating it as a continuation of the earlier episodes nor independently sufficient to ground a cognizable constitutional claim. <i>See id.</i> at 292-94.

Puerto Rico,</i> 353 F.3d 108, 119-20 (1st Cir.2003) (noting that a claim accrues \"when facts supportive of a civil rights action are or should be apparent to a reasonably prudent person similarly situated\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the plaintiffs do not dispute that they knew, or had reason to know, of their injuries immediately following the occurrence of each of the various incidents. It is likewise undisputed that the only stand-alone claim of injury that falls chronologically within the limitations period is the claim relating to the Secretary's July 1999 transfer of administrative responsibility over CRH to San Juan Bautista. The plaintiffs nevertheless seek to salvage their earlier claims by bringing them under the umbrella of the continuing violation doctrine. To that end, they allege that the CRH contretemps was part of a long-running serial violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the serial violation branch of the continuing violation doctrine, a plaintiff may link a number of discriminatory acts emanating from the same discriminatory animus, even though each act constitutes a separate wrong. <i>See Provencher v. CVS Pharmacy,</i> 145 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Jensen v. Frank,</i> 912 F.2d 517, 522 (1st Cir.1990). If the plaintiff can forge that link and can also show that at least one act in the series occurred within the limitations period, the suit may be considered timely as to all the acts. <i>See Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co.,</i> 101 F.3d 218, 221-22 (1st Cir.1996); <i>Kassaye v. Bryant Coll.,</i> 999 F.2d 603, 606 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order for the serial violation theory to apply, the act that falls within the limitations period must itself constitute an actionable violation. <i>Lawton,</i> 101 F.3d at 222 (\"Common sense teaches that a plaintiff cannot resuscitate time-barred acts, said to be discriminatory, by the simple expedient of linking them to a non-identical, non-discriminatory, non-time barred act.\"); <i>Muniz-Cabrero v. Ruiz,</i> 23 F.3d 607, 610-11 (1st Cir.1994) (refusing to apply the serial violation theory when the plaintiff had failed to show that the timely acts were \"separate and actionable &#167; 1983 violations\"); <i>Mack v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co.,</i> 871 F.2d 179, 183 (1st Cir.1989) (stating that the plaintiff \"retain[s] the burden of demonstrating that <i>some</i> discriminatory act transpired within the appropriate time frame\"). It follows inexorably that if the plaintiffs have failed to state an independently actionable claim based on the CRH incident, they cannot rely on that incident to anchor the rest of their claims (each of which arose out of events that occurred well prior to November 21, 1998&#8212;the earliest day within the limitations period). Consequently, we examine that claim before proceeding further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>C.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>The July 1999 Incident</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their complaint and their brief, the plaintiffs have proposed, without meaningful elaboration, that the assignment to San Juan Bautista of the right to administer CRH's affairs contravened their due process, equal protection, and First Amendment rights. We address each of these suggested bases for liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Procedural Due Process.</i> The plaintiffs have made a general suggestion that the Secretary's failure to award them the right to purchase, lease, or manage CRH violated due process. To the extent that they hope to maintain a procedural due process claim, they must first point to a protected liberty or property interest. <i>Bd. of Regents v. Roth,</i> 408 U.S. 564, 569, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972) (\"The requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation of interests encompassed by the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of liberty and property.\"). There is no liberty interest implicated here,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> so the plaintiffs' claim stands or falls, in the first instance, on the existence of a constitutionally protected property interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to establish a constitutionally protected property interest, the plaintiffs must identify a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\" to the property in question&#8212;a claim of entitlement created and defined by \"existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701. For this purpose, \"an abstract need or desire\" or a \"unilateral expectation\" are not sufficient to cement a constitutionally protected interest. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs allege that, on two occasions, they wrote to the Secretary to express an interest in purchasing, leasing, or managing CRH. That is not enough: they have wholly failed to identify any legally cognizable property interest in acquiring a right to purchase, lease, manage, or otherwise participate in the privatization of CRH. Puerto Rico law governing the Department of Health's authority to grant contracts for the privatization of publicly-owned health care facilities dispels any doubt. The statutory scheme not only explicitly allows the Secretary to award such contracts to medical schools without following the usual bidding protocol but also directs that she prefer such institutions. <i>See</i> 24 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 3322, 3306. These statutes make it pellucid that the plaintiffs had no legally cognizable right to vie for the CRH contract on an equal footing with San Juan Bautista, let alone an entitlement to have that contract awarded to them rather than to a medical school. The short of it is that the plaintiffs had nothing more than a unilateral desire to secure a stake in CRH's privatization. The frustration of such a subjective desire is a far cry from the deprivation of a constitutionally protected property interest. For this reason, the plaintiffs' procedural due process claim fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Substantive Due Process.</i> Next, the plaintiffs contend that the Secretary's awarding of a contract to San Juan Bautista was \"[a]rbitrary, capricious, unfounded, and discriminatory,\" thus violating their right to substantive due process. This contention rings hollow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourteenth Amendment protects against deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. amend XIV. The substantive component of this guarantee guards against \"certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\" <i>Daniels v. Williams,</i> 474 U.S. 327, 331, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986). In the substantive due process context (as in the procedural due process context), a plaintiff, as a condition precedent to stating a valid claim, must exhibit a constitutionally protected interest in life, liberty, or property. <i>See Washington v. Glucksberg,</i> 521 U.S. 702, 722, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 521 U.S. 702 (1997); <i>Rivera,</i> 402 F.3d at 33-34; <i>Macone v. Town of Wakefield,</i> 277 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2002). As explained above, <i>see supra</i> Part II(C)(1), the plaintiffs have failed to identify such an interest. Consequently, their substantive due process claim founders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Equal Protection.</i> The plaintiffs asseverate that the Secretary's grant of the CRH contract to San Juan Bautista denied them a fair shake in the potentially lucrative process of privatization of public health facilities, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. This asseveration is frivolous. The plaintiffs failed, even when pressed at oral argument, to position their claim within the familiar equal protection framework: they have not claimed membership in a protected class or demonstrated that other entities, similarly situated, were treated differently concerning the award of hospital contracts. Their inability to identify these doctrinal rudiments is fatal to their equal protection challenge. <i>See Barrington Cove Ltd. P'ship v. R.I. Hous. &amp; Mortg. Fin. Corp.,</i> 246 F.3d 1, 7-10 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Hennessy v. City of Melrose,</i> 194 F.3d 237, 244 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Gilbert v. City of Cambridge,</i> 932 F.2d 51, 66 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>First Amendment.</i> The plaintiffs' last-gasp claim is that the award of the CRH contract to an unrelated entity was part of a \"punitive campaign\" to retaliate against them for availing themselves of commonwealth court remedies following the Secretary's denial of their applications for certain hospital permits. The Supreme Court has made it plain that \"even though a person has no `right' to a valuable governmental benefit and even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons, there are some reasons upon which the government may not rely.\" <i>Perry v. Sindermann,</i> 408 U.S. 593, 597, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972). The exercise of First Amendment rights is among the constitutionally proscribed reasons for the denial of a government benefit. <i>Id.</i> Thus, we have recognized, as a general matter, that \"[c]laims of retaliation for the exercise of First Amendment rights are cognizable under &#167; 1983.\" <i>Powell v. Alexander,</i> 391 F.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is an open question, however, whether First Amendment retaliation claims presented by disappointed bidders or applicants for new government contracts are cognizable. In <i>Board of County Commissioners v. Umbehr,</i> 518 U.S. 668, 673, 116 S.Ct. 2342, 135 L.Ed.2d 843 (1996), the Court held that First Amendment protections extend to independent contractors alleging termination or prevention of automatic renewal of at-will government contracts in retaliation for the exercise of the freedom of speech. On that basis, the Court held that a person so situated could state a valid cause of action under section 1983. <i>See id.</i> at 686, 116 S.Ct. 2342. In so holding, the Justices \"emphasize[d] the limited nature of [their] decision,\" which concerned only \"the termination of a pre-existing commercial relationship with the government,\" and, accordingly, declined to address \"the possibility of suits by bidders or applicants for new government contracts who cannot rely on such a relationship.\" <i>Id.</i> at 685, 116 S.Ct. 2342.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following <i>Umbehr</i> and a closely related decision recognizing similar protections for independent contractors alleging politically motivated discrimination, <i>see O'Hare Truck Serv., Inc. v. City of Northlake,</i> 518 U.S. 712, 714-15, 116 S.Ct. 2353, 135 L.Ed.2d 874 (1996), we have acknowledged this uncertainty, observing that \"[t]he next area of contest appears to revolve around those who wish for the first time to bid for government contracts.\" <i>Prisma Zona Exploratoria v. Calderon,</i> 310 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2002). In <i>Prisma Zona,</i> however, we found it unnecessary to resolve that question, <i>see id.</i>&#8212;and we have the same luxury today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming, for argument's sake, that an entity that has no preexisting contractual relationship with the Commonwealth can state a claim under section 1983 for an allegedly retaliatory denial of a bid, we nevertheless find that the plaintiffs have failed to state a valid retaliation claim because they have not identified any action taken against them by the Secretary in connection with the privatization of CRH, whether in the form of an actual denial of a bid or an improper refusal to consider an application. To the contrary, the Secretary, in accordance with her authority under 24 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 3306, 3322, never issued an invitation for bids. Consequently, the plaintiffs' status does not rise to that of disappointed bidders, and the grant of the CRH contract to San Juan Bautista cannot be characterized as an action taken against them so as to satisfy the threshold requirement of alleging a retaliatory decision. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the protections recognized in <i>Umbehr</i> were to extend to unsolicited bids for new government contracts&#8212;a matter on which we take no view&#8212;establishing a First Amendment retaliation claim would necessitate a showing \"that [the plaintiff's] conduct was constitutionally protected, and that this conduct was a `substantial factor' [or] ... a `motivating factor'\" driving the allegedly retaliatory decision. <i>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977). Even so, the defendant could then avoid a finding of liability by way of the so-called <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense, which requires a showing that \"it would have reached the same decision ... even in the absence of the protected conduct.\" <i>Id.; see also Umbehr,</i> 518 U.S. at 685, 116 S.Ct. 2342.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the plaintiffs have alleged that, on three occasions occurring in 1996 and 1997, they successfully appealed denials of applications for hospital licenses. As a general matter, this type of conduct&#8212;seeking to avail oneself of judicial remedies&#8212;is constitutionally protected. <i>See Powell,</i> 391 F.3d at 17. Thus, we assume that the plaintiffs have stated the first material element of a retaliation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is about as far as the allegations of the complaint take the plaintiffs. Although they have shown constitutionally protected conduct, they have failed to identify any retaliatory decision made by the Secretary, within the limitations period, in response to that conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint provides no support for the contention that the Secretary's grant of a contract to administer CRH to San Juan Bautista was connected in any way to the plaintiffs, let alone to their earlier court activities. The Secretary, pursuant to a statutory preference that the plaintiffs do not challenge, elected to award the contract to an accredited medical school without conducting an open application process. At no point did she deny any application or bid submitted by the plaintiffs. By like token, the grant to San Juan Bautista did not involve any omission on the part of the Secretary: she was not required to extend a request for bids; the plaintiffs had no constitutionally protected interest in participating in such a process; and, therefore, the failure to respond to the plaintiffs' unsolicited notices of interest cannot plausibly be characterized as the neglect of an obligation owed to the plaintiffs. In the absence of some action directed against the plaintiffs or some omission that diminishes a constitutionally protected interest or entitlement, the Secretary's conduct cannot be said to have been taken against the plaintiffs. <i>See LaRou v. Ridlon,</i> 98 F.3d 659, 662-63 (1st Cir.1996) (finding that the decision to post a job listing without first making offer to plaintiff was not retaliatory because defendant had no obligation to give preference to the plaintiff).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the Secretary's action could, by some thaumaturgical feat, be characterized as one directed against the plaintiffs (rather than one that merely has an incidental effect on an unprotected interest), the plaintiffs would have to show that the adverse action was substantially attributable to the exercise of their rights of appeal and not to some other (unrelated) reason. <i>See Mihos v. Swift,</i> 358 F.3d 91, 108 (1st Cir.2004). Other than making a vague mention of the \"timing of the acts\" and a conclusory reference to the defendant's \"hostility,\" the plaintiffs have not made any allegation that their earlier recourse to the Puerto Rico courts was a substantial or motivating factor in the Secretary's decision to award the CRH contract to San Juan Bautista.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the record establishes that, even without the protected activity, the same result would have obtained. After all, the Secretary, on this occasion, took no action against the plaintiffs. She was mandated by law to prefer medical schools in the awarding of hospital contracts&#8212;and that is precisely what she did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, we conclude that the plaintiffs have failed to state a constitutionally cognizable claim related to the July 1999 contract award. Because that incident cannot support an actionable claim under section 1983, it cannot anchor the remainder of the plaintiffs' (time-barred) claims. <i>See Muniz-Cabrero,</i> 23 F.3d at 610-11. Thus, we do not reach the question of whether the other criteria necessary for a serial violation claim are satisfied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

After careful consideration of the briefs and the record, we conclude that the most recent incident described in the complaint was not actionable; that the earlier incidents fell outside the limitations period; and, therefore, that the district court properly dismissed the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Background</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in 1993, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico embarked on a process of privatizing its extensive network of public health facilities.

The complaint charged that, between 1993 and 1999, the Secretary had refused to grant certificates of necessity and convenience required to develop certain medical facilities at two of the plaintiffs' hospitals,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> denied them permission to transfer a license from one hospital to another, and awarded contracts for the purchase, lease, and/or administration of various public health facilities to entities not affiliated with the plaintiffs. The complaint further alleged that these acts and omissions were discriminatory, transgressed due process, denied the plaintiffs the equal protection of the laws, and were taken in retaliation for the plaintiffs' exercise of their First Amendment rights (i.e., their persistent challenges to various of the Secretary's actions in the local courts).

The plaintiffs rejoined that the described incidents comprised an interrelated series of constitutional violations, one of which occurred within the limitations period, and, thus, that the \"continuing violation\" doctrine salvaged all of their claims.

That is not enough: they have wholly failed to identify any legally cognizable property interest in acquiring a right to purchase, lease, manage, or otherwise participate in the privatization of CRH. Puerto Rico law governing the Department of Health's authority to grant contracts for the privatization of publicly-owned health care facilities dispels any doubt. The statutory scheme not only explicitly allows the Secretary to award such contracts to medical schools without following the usual bidding protocol but also directs that she prefer such institutions. <i>See</i> 24 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 3322, 3306. These statutes make it pellucid that the plaintiffs had no legally cognizable right to vie for the CRH contract on an equal footing with San Juan Bautista, let alone an entitlement to have that contract awarded to them rather than to a medical school. The short of it is that the plaintiffs had nothing more than a unilateral desire to secure a stake in CRH's privatization. The frustration of such a subjective desire is a far cry from the deprivation of a constitutionally protected property interest.

To the contrary, the Secretary, in accordance with her authority under 24 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 3306, 3322, never issued an invitation for bids. Consequently, the plaintiffs' status does not rise to that of disappointed bidders, and the grant of the CRH contract to San Juan Bautista cannot be characterized as an action taken against them so as to satisfy the threshold requirement of alleging a retaliatory decision. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the protections recognized in <i>Umbehr</i> were to extend to unsolicited bids for new government contracts&#8212;a matter on which we take no view&#8212;establishing a First Amendment retaliation claim would necessitate a showing \"that [the plaintiff's] conduct was constitutionally protected, and that this conduct was a `substantial factor' [or] ... a `motivating factor'\" driving the allegedly retaliatory decision. <i>Mt.

Healthy</i> defense, which requires a showing that \"it would have reached the same decision ... even in the absence of the protected conduct.\" <i>Id.; see also Umbehr,</i> 518 U.S. at 685, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118059\"><a href=\"/opinion/118059/board-of-commrs-wabaunsee-cty-v-umbehr/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As a general matter, this type of conduct&#8212;seeking to avail oneself of judicial remedies&#8212;is constitutionally protected. <i>See Powell,</i> 391 F.3d at 17. Thus, we assume that the plaintiffs have stated the first material element of a retaliation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is about as far as the allegations of the complaint take the plaintiffs. Although they have shown constitutionally protected conduct, they have failed to identify any retaliatory decision made by the Secretary, within the limitations period, in response to that conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint provides no support for the contention that the Secretary's grant of a contract to administer CRH to San Juan Bautista was connected in any way to the plaintiffs, let alone to their earlier court activities. The Secretary, pursuant to a statutory preference that the plaintiffs do not challenge, elected to award the contract to an accredited medical school without conducting an open application process. At no point did she deny any application or bid submitted by the plaintiffs. By like token, the grant to San Juan Bautista did not involve any omission on the part of the Secretary: she was not required to extend a request for bids; the plaintiffs had no constitutionally protected interest in participating in such a process; and, therefore, the failure to respond to the plaintiffs' unsolicited notices of interest cannot plausibly be characterized as the neglect of an obligation owed to the plaintiffs. In the absence of some action directed against the plaintiffs or some omission that diminishes a constitutionally protected interest or entitlement, the Secretary's conduct cannot be said to have been taken against the plaintiffs. <i>See LaRou v. Ridlon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197044\"><a href=\"/opinion/197044/larou-v-ridlon/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span>, 662-63 (1st Cir.1996) (finding that the decision to post a job listing without first making offer to plaintiff was not retaliatory because defendant had no obligation to give preference to the plaintiff).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the Secretary's action could, by some thaumaturgical feat, be characterized as one directed against the plaintiffs (rather than one that merely has an incidental effect on an unprotected interest), the plaintiffs would have to show that the adverse action was substantially attributable to the exercise of their rights of appeal and not to some other (unrelated) reason. <i>See Mihos v. Swift,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785090\"><a href=\"/opinion/785090/christy-peter-mihos-appelleecross-appellant-v-jane-swift-individually/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span>, 108 (1st Cir.2004). Other than making a vague mention of the \"timing of the acts\" and a conclusory reference to the defendant's \"hostility,\" the plaintiffs have not made any allegation that their earlier recourse to the Puerto Rico courts was a substantial or motivating factor in the Secretary's decision to award the CRH contract to San Juan Bautista.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the record establishes that, even without the protected activity, the same result would have obtained. After all, the Secretary, on this occasion, took no action against the plaintiffs. She was mandated by law to prefer medical schools in the awarding of hospital contracts&#8212;and that is precisely what she did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, we conclude that the plaintiffs have failed to state a constitutionally cognizable claim related to the July 1999 contract award. Because that incident cannot support an actionable claim under section 1983, it cannot anchor the remainder of the plaintiffs' (time-barred) claims. <i>See Muniz-Cabrero,</i> 23 F.3d at 610-11. Thus, we do not reach the question of whether the other criteria necessary for a serial violation claim are satisfied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.
