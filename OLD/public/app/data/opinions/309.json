Barbadoro,            U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                     Torruella, Selya and Boudin,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Gary Dewayne Johnson on brief pro se.\n     Michael A. Delaney, Attorney General, and Danielle L. Pacik,\nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                               March 18, 2010\n\f          Per Curiam.    Gary Dewayne Johnson appeals a district\n\ncourt judgment that determined that the Prisoner Litigation Reform\n\nAct (\"PLRA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), barred his 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\nclaim against prison officer, Robert Thyng, because Johnson had\n\nfailed to exhaust all of his administrative remedies.   We affirm.\n\n                                I.\n\n          In 2007, Johnson was incarcerated at New Hampshire's\n\nNorthern Correctional Facility (\"NCF\").   That facility has a three\n\nlevel grievance process, each level corresponding to review by an\n\nincreasingly higher office in the chain of command.      The first\n\nlevel of grievance is to the inmate's Unit Manager; the second\n\nlevel is to the Warden; and the third level is to the Commissioner.\n\n          On May 31, Johnson, who was convicted of a sexual assault\n\non a minor, reported hearing \"rumors\" and threats like \"When you\n\nleast expect it Johnson\" and \"Filthy pedophile watch your back.\"\n\nJohnson filed a level one grievance, which said that, although he\n\nfelt safe on \"C Block,\" he did not feel safe outside, in the \"chow\n\nhall\", or in the hallway during \"chow times.\"\n\n          On June 5, Johnson met with Officer Thyng and asked for\n\nprotective custody.   According to Thyng, he informed Johnson that\n\nhe would need to be segregated from the other inmates; he would be\n\nhandcuffed for his own safety; and he would be brought to a\n\nsegregation unit pending administrative review.       According to\n\nThyng, he also explained that, to obtain protective custody,\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fJohnson would need to identify an inmate or inmates that he feared.\n\nJohnson reported that, although he heard the stated remarks, he was\n\nunable to identify any specific speaker because the remarks were\n\nalways    made    behind    his     back    and    in     a   crowded   area.      Thyng\n\ndetermined that Johnson was not eligible for protective custody\n\nstatus due to a lack of verifiable information that Johnson was in\n\ndanger of being physically harmed.                  Thereafter, Johnson signed a\n\nstatement that said: \"I feel safe on C block, as I have been there\n\nfor the past year, and I wish not to move, and no pc [protective\n\ncustody] at this moment.\"\n\n               Johnson, however, claimed that Thyng first denied his\n\ngrievance and that, five minutes later, he was called back to\n\nThyng's    office        where,     under       \"duress       and   threat    of   being\n\nhandcuffed,\" brought to \"the tank,\" and losing his property, he was\n\nforced    to     write    and     sign    the     statement     about   not     desiring\n\nprotective custody status.               On June 8, Johnson filed a level two\n\ngrievance with Warden Blaisdell, complaining that Thyng had coerced\n\nthat statement from him and reiterating his request for protective\n\nstatus.\n\n               On June 10, Johnson was threatened by inmate Carl Bickham\n\nin the chow hall.        Johnson did not report this threat.                 On June 11,\n\nwhile in the chow hall, Bickham assaulted Johnson.                           Johnson was\n\ntreated for a head laceration, a black eye, and a concussion.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fAccording to Johnson, he suffered a detached retina which has\n\nrequired several surgeries and he continues to have problems.\n\n             In the wake of the assault, a protective custody board\n\nwas convened on June 12.         Johnson indicated that he feared for his\n\nsafety as he believed that he was still susceptible to physical\n\nharm by Bickham.       The board determined that NCF would transfer\n\nBickham from NCF to the Concord state prison to serve punitive\n\nsegregation and request that Bickham not be returned to NCF.              Due\n\nto Bickham's transfer, the board determined that Johnson could\n\nremain at NCF and denied protective custody status.\n\n             On June 13, Johnson filed an \"emergency\" grievance with\n\nCommissioner Wrenn, contending that he had been assaulted on June\n\n11 because of rumors that he suspected had been spread by staff and\n\nthat he feared retaliation by staff.               When he submitted this\n\n\"emergency\" grievance to Commissioner Wrenn on June 13, Johnson had\n\nnot yet received Warden Blaisdell's response to his June 8th second\n\nlevel grievance.      In his \"emergency\" grievance, Johnson asked the\n\nCommissioner for \"help for relief\" but also specifically remarked\n\nthat \"in no way will this grievance take the place of the actual\n\ngrievance that will be submitted to you upon my receiving response\n\nfrom   the   warden   and   my    [June   8th]   second   level   grievance.\"\n\nSubsequently on that same day, Warden Blaisdell responded to\n\nJohnson's June 8th level two grievance, writing:            \"What is it that\n\nyou actually want?       Do you want to [sic] PC?           Transfer out of\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fstate?    If we have to PC you[,] that can be done if the criteria is\n\nthere.\"\n\n            On June 19, Commissioner Wrenn replied to Johnson's June\n\n13th \"emergency\" grievance, stating \"Since this will not take the\n\nplace of the actual grievance you will file after receiving a\n\nresponse from the warden, I will wait for the actual grievance\n\nbefore I reply.\"\n\n            Johnson   never   filed    any    further   grievance   with   the\n\nCommissioner.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            Johnson, who had filed a § 1983 action in the federal\n\ndistrict court prior to the assault, amended that action to include\n\na claim that, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, Thyng had\n\nintentionally failed to protect Johnson from a known risk to his\n\nsafety by Thyng's June 5th refusal of his request for protective\n\ncustody.1     After   a   one-day     bench   trial,    the   district   court\n\nconcluded that this \"failure to protect\" claim was barred by a\n\nfailure to exhaust administrative remedies, as required by PLRA as\n\na condition precedent to suit.\n\n            PLRA provides:\n\n\n\n     1\n      The district court disposed of the other claims against other\ndefendants by way of summary judgment, leaving only the \"failure to\nprotect\" claim against Thyng. On appeal, Johnson raises no issues\nwith respect to the district court's resolution of his other\nclaims. Accordingly, we omit any description and discussion of\nthese other claims.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f                 No action shall be brought with\n                 respect to prison conditions under\n                 section 1983 of this title, or any\n                 other Federal law, by the prisoner\n                 confined in any jail, prison, or\n                 other correctional facility until\n                 such administrative remedies as are\n                 available are exhausted.\n\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).         We review, de novo, the dismissal of\n\nJohnson's § 1983 claim for failure to comply with PLRA's exhaustion\n\nrequirement. Acosta v. United States Marshals Serv., 445 F.3d 509,\n\n512 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           Exhaustion is mandatory, Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 85\n\n(2006),   and   \"has   a   decidedly    procedural    emphasis,\"    Booth   v.\n\nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 739 (2001).           That is, what must be exhausted\n\nis the process, not the form of relief.              Id.    \"All 'available'\n\nremedies must [] be exhausted; those remedies need not meet federal\n\nstandards; nor must they be 'plain, speedy, and effective.'\"\n\nPorter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).                 A prisoner must\n\nexhaust administrative remedies before a complaint under § 1983\n\nwill be entertained even where the relief sought cannot be granted\n\nby the administrative process.         Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. at 734.\n\n           To properly exhaust administrative remedies, a prisoner\n\nmust complete the prison grievance procedures.             Jones v. Bock, 549\n\nU.S. 199, 218 (2007).      \"[I]t is the prison's requirements, and not\n\nthe PLRA, that define the boundaries of proper exhaustion.\"             Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f                                           III.\n\n               Thyng     argues     that    Johnson      failed    to   exhaust   his\n\nadministrative remedies because he never completed the third level\n\nof the process by filing his grievance with the Commissioner.\n\nJohnson does not dispute that he did not complete the third level\n\nof   the     grievance     process     by    filing   his    grievance     with   the\n\nCommissioner.2          Instead, he argues that the third level of NCF's\n\ngrievance process is not mandatory. His theory is that an optional\n\nlevel of administrative review need not be exhausted, that he has\n\nexhausted any mandatory component of the prison grievance system,\n\nand,       therefore,    he   has    complied     with    PLRA's    requirement   of\n\nexhaustion as a condition precedent to filing suit.\n\n               In support of his claim that the third level of NCF's\n\ngrievance process is not mandatory, Johnson relies on what he views\n\n\n\n       2\n      We need not address Johnson's contention that Thyng\ninterfered with his filing of his level two grievance with the\nwarden. For purposes of determining whether Johnson had complied\nwith the exhaustion requirement, the district court made several\nassumptions in Johnson's favor. First, there was some dispute as\nto whether Johnson used the proper grievance form.          Johnson\nasserted that he used an \"inmate request\" form because Thyng would\nnot give him a grievance form and threatened to retaliate against\nhim. The district court accepted Johnson's contention as true for\npurposes of its analysis and further accepted, for purposes of\nanalysis, that the fact that the grievance was filed on a request\nform, rather than a grievance form, was not determinative of\nwhether Johnson had complied with the exhaustion requirement.\nSecond, the court accepted Johnson's version of the facts regarding\nhis compliance with the first and second levels of the grievance\nprocedure and, so, assumed, in Johnson's favor, that he had\ncomplied with the grievance process through level two. We, too,\nmake these same assumptions in Johnson's favor.\n\n                                            -7-\n\fas permissive language in two documents: (1) the N.H. Department of\n\nCorrections Policy and Procedure Directive (\"PPD\") 1.16 IV C, says,\n\nin   relevant    part,   \"If   an    inmate      is   not    satisfied   with    the\n\nWarden/Director's response, he/she may file an appeal using the\n\ngrievance form, to the Commissioner's office\" (emphasis added) and\n\n(2) NCF's Inmate Manual Section D.3, says, in relevant part, \"if\n\nthe Warden has not solved the problem with his/her response, a\n\nfinal   grievance     form     may   be     sent      to    the   Commissioner    of\n\nCorrections\" (emphasis added).\n\n           Whatever the merits of Johnson's contention that level\n\nthree of the prison grievance process is optional, rather than\n\nmandatory, PLRA, nonetheless, speaks in terms of requiring that all\n\n\"available\" remedies be exhausted.               See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) (\"No\n\naction shall be brought ... until such administrative remedies as\n\nare available are exhausted\");            Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. at 524\n\n(\"All 'available' remedies must [] be exhausted.\").                  A level three\n\ngrievance directed to the Commissioner was \"available,\" even if not\n\nmandatory.      And, Johnson concedes he did not file one.\n\n           The emerging case law rejects Johnson's theory that an\n\noptional level of administrative review need not be exhausted for\n\npurposes of PLRA.        For example, the Sixth Circuit in Owens v.\n\nKeeling,   461    F.3d   763    (6th      Cir.    2006),     concluded   that    the\n\npermissive language authorizing an appeal -- the prisoner \"may\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fappeal\"   a    classification   action     --   is   irrelevant    to   the\n\nconsideration of the exhaustion issue.\n\n                  \"Although    a   remedy    must   be\n                  'available' in order for a prisoner\n                  to be required to pursue it to\n                  exhaust his claim, ... this does not\n                  mean that the prison must require\n                  the prisoner to exhaust his remedies\n                  for the remedy to be 'available.'\n                  Generally, the prisoner would be\n                  free to choose not to exhaust his\n                  remedies; he would only be required\n                  to do so if he wants to file a\n                  complaint regarding the matter in\n                  federal court.\"\n\n\nId. at 770 n.4 (emphasis in the original; citations omitted).           The\n\nThird Circuit concluded similarly in an unpublished decision.\n\nDavis v. Warman, 49 Fed. Appx. 365, 367-68 (3d. Cir. 2002).\n\nDistrict courts, as well, in unpublished decisions, have rejected\n\nthe   argument   that   permissive   language   in   a   prison   grievance\n\nprocedure means that that procedure falls outside PLRA's exhaustion\n\nrequirement.     See, e.g., Warren v. Fort Dodge Corr. Facility, 2009\n\nWL 1473955, at *3 (N.D. Iowa May 27, 2009); Braimah v. Shelton,\n\n2005 WL 1331147, at *3 (D. Neb. May 20, 2005); Hope v. Velasco,\n\n2004 WL 417198, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 23, 2004).\n\n           Any reliance on an earlier published district court\n\nopinion, In re Bayside Prison Litigation, 190 F.Supp.2d 755, 771-72\n\n(D. N.J. 2002), for a contrary position is unwarranted in light of\n\nthat court's subsequent disavowal of its conclusion as \"clearly\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\ferroneous.\" In re Bayside Prison Litigation, No. 97-cv-05127, slip\n\nop. at 8-9 (D. N.J. June 9, 2004).\n\n           Thus,     even       assuming    that       Johnson     has    correctly\n\ncharacterized    the    third     level    of   NCF's    grievance       process   as\n\noptional, and not mandatory, a level three grievance directed to\n\nthe Commissioner was an \"available\" remedy for purposes of                     PLRA\n\nexhaustion.     Johnson's concession that he did not file one dooms\n\nhis § 1983 claim.\n\n           Johnson proffers an additional theory in support of his\n\ncontention    that   he     has   complied      with    PLRA's     requirement     of\n\nexhaustion as a condition precedent to filing suit. Johnson points\n\nout that the prison transferred his assailant, Bickham, to another\n\nprison   facility      before     the   conclusion      of   the   administrative\n\ngrievance process.        According to Johnson, since he achieved a\n\nfavorable outcome, he did not need to appeal the Warden's decision\n\nto the Commissioner and his \"available\" remedies were, therefore,\n\nexhausted.3   If, in fact, there was no pertinent additional relief\n\n\n     3\n      At the bench trial, Johnson's explanation for his failure to\ncomplete the third level of grievance was somewhat different. He\nexplained there that, because he had already been assaulted, he\nbelieved that filing that level of grievance would be futile. The\ndistrict court rejected that rationale on the basis of Booth v.\nChurner, 532 U.S. at 741 n.6 (rejecting a \"futility\" exception and\nholding that PLRA mandates exhaustion despite the fact that the\ngrievance process could not provide the inmate with money damages)\nand Medina-Claudio v. Rodriguez-Mateo, 292 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir.\n2002) (holding that inmate must exhaust administrative remedies at\nthe first prison facility even if transferred to a different\nfacility).\n     Defendant Thyng argues that Johnson's current explanation,\n\n                                        -10-\n\fobtainable through the grievance process, further exhaustion might\n\nbe excused.    See Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. at 736 (holding that\n\nadministrative remedies remain \"available\" and must be exhausted so\n\nlong as the administrative process has authority to take some\n\naction in response to a complaint, even if not the remedial action\n\nthe inmate demands) (emphasis added); Brown v. Valoff, 422 F.3d\n\n926, 934-35 (9th Cir. 2005) (concluding that Booth made clear that\n\nexhaustion is not required when no pertinent relief can be obtained\n\nthrough the administrative process) (emphasis added).\n\n           Johnson's current claim of being satisfied with the\n\nprison transfer of Bickham, however, conflicts with the record. For\n\nexample, on June 13, two days after the assault by Bickham, Johnson\n\nwrote to Thyng stating that, even though Bickham had been sent to\n\nanother facility, he did not feel safe because of \"ongoing threats\n\nand rumors from Mr. Bickum [sic] friends and other inmates.\"\n\nJohnson's district court filings, as well, contradict Johnson's\n\ncurrent contention that he was satisfied with the transfer of\n\nBickham.      On   July   17,   Johnson   wrote   to   the   district    court,\n\ncontending that he was \"still afraid for [his] life.\"                   And, in\n\n\n\ni.e., that he was \"satisfied\" with the prison's response of\ntransferring Bickham, was not raised in the district court and is,\ntherefore, waived. As Johnson is pro se, we may grant him some\nleeway as to whether his current claim of being \"satisfied\" by the\ntransfer is but another way of describing the circumstances in the\nwake of the assault. In any event, we need not rely on the waiver\nargument as, for the reasons stated in the text, Johnson's\ncontention lacks merit.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fresponse to Thyng's motion for summary judgment, Johnson claimed\n\nthat, at the protective custody board when he was informed that\n\nBickham had been transferred, he responded: \"What about the other\n\ninmates that are after me or have heard the rumors?                   What about\n\n[Bickham's] brother that [sic] lives on D-Block?\"                  It is evident\n\nthat, contrary to Johnson's current assertion, he was not satisfied\n\nwith the prison transfer of Bickham.           And, in any event, Bickham's\n\ntransfer to a different facility did not constitute the only\n\navailable   relief,   such   that     the    administrative     process      could\n\nprovide no other pertinent relief. Given that Johnson persisted in\n\nclaiming the existence of threats from other inmates, the level\n\nthree of the grievance process was available to provide a remedy to\n\nrelieve   those   threats,    apart     from    the     transfer    of    Bickham.\n\nJohnson's failure to exhaust this level of the grievance process\n\nprecludes his current federal court claim.

County\n\nof Orange, 467 F.3d 170, 177 (2d Cir. 2006) (dismissal of § 1983\n\naction affirmed for failure to exhaust where inmate's transfer to\n\nanother   prison,   while    arguably       providing    him   with      relief   by\n\nseparating him from officers who allegedly mistreated him, did not\n\nprovide him with all of the relief available to him, since a formal\n\ngrievance might have resulted in developing policies and procedures\n\npertaining to the grievance of disciplining the officers).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f                              IV.\n\n          The judgment of the district court, entered on May 8,\n\n2009, is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -13-\n\f",

Gary Dewayne Johnson appeals a district\n\ncourt judgment that determined that the Prisoner Litigation Reform\n\nAct (\"PLRA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), barred his 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\nclaim against prison officer, Robert Thyng, because Johnson had\n\nfailed to exhaust all of his administrative remedies.   We affirm.\n\n                                I.\n\n          In 2007, Johnson was incarcerated at New Hampshire's\n\nNorthern Correctional Facility (\"NCF\").   That facility has a three\n\nlevel grievance process, each level corresponding to review by an\n\nincreasingly higher office in the chain of command.      The first\n\nlevel of grievance is to the inmate's Unit Manager; the second\n\nlevel is to the Warden; and the third level is to the Commissioner.\n\n          On May 31, Johnson, who was convicted of a sexual assault\n\non a minor, reported hearing \"rumors\" and threats like \"When you\n\nleast expect it Johnson\" and \"Filthy pedophile watch your back.\"\n\nJohnson filed a level one grievance, which said that, although he\n\nfelt safe on \"C Block,\" he did not feel safe outside, in the \"chow\n\nhall\", or in the hallway during \"chow times.\"\n\n          On June 5, Johnson met with Officer Thyng and asked for\n\nprotective custody.   According to Thyng, he informed Johnson that\n\nhe would need to be segregated from the other inmates; he would be\n\nhandcuffed for his own safety; and he would be brought to a\n\nsegregation unit pending administrative review.       According to\n\nThyng, he also explained that, to obtain protective custody,\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fJohnson would need to identify an inmate or inmates that he feared.\n\nJohnson reported that, although he heard the stated remarks, he was\n\nunable to identify any specific speaker because the remarks were\n\nalways    made    behind    his     back    and    in     a   crowded   area.      Thyng\n\ndetermined that Johnson was not eligible for protective custody\n\nstatus due to a lack of verifiable information that Johnson was in\n\ndanger of being physically harmed.                  Thereafter, Johnson signed a\n\nstatement that said: \"I feel safe on C block, as I have been there\n\nfor the past year, and I wish not to move, and no pc [protective\n\ncustody] at this moment.\"\n\n               Johnson, however, claimed that Thyng first denied his\n\ngrievance and that, five minutes later, he was called back to\n\nThyng's    office        where,     under       \"duress       and   threat    of   being\n\nhandcuffed,\" brought to \"the tank,\" and losing his property, he was\n\nforced    to     write    and     sign    the     statement     about   not     desiring\n\nprotective custody status.               On June 8, Johnson filed a level two\n\ngrievance with Warden Blaisdell, complaining that Thyng had coerced\n\nthat statement from him and reiterating his request for protective\n\nstatus.\n\n               On June 10, Johnson was threatened by inmate Carl Bickham\n\nin the chow hall.        Johnson did not report this threat.                 On June 11,\n\nwhile in the chow hall, Bickham assaulted Johnson.                           Johnson was\n\ntreated for a head laceration, a black eye, and a concussion.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fAccording to Johnson, he suffered a detached retina which has\n\nrequired several surgeries and he continues to have problems.\n\n             In the wake of the assault, a protective custody board\n\nwas convened on June 12.         Johnson indicated that he feared for his\n\nsafety as he believed that he was still susceptible to physical\n\nharm by Bickham.       The board determined that NCF would transfer\n\nBickham from NCF to the Concord state prison to serve punitive\n\nsegregation and request that Bickham not be returned to NCF.              Due\n\nto Bickham's transfer, the board determined that Johnson could\n\nremain at NCF and denied protective custody status.\n\n             On June 13, Johnson filed an \"emergency\" grievance with\n\nCommissioner Wrenn, contending that he had been assaulted on June\n\n11 because of rumors that he suspected had been spread by staff and\n\nthat he feared retaliation by staff.               When he submitted this\n\n\"emergency\" grievance to Commissioner Wrenn on June 13, Johnson had\n\nnot yet received Warden Blaisdell's response to his June 8th second\n\nlevel grievance.      In his \"emergency\" grievance, Johnson asked the\n\nCommissioner for \"help for relief\" but also specifically remarked\n\nthat \"in no way will this grievance take the place of the actual\n\ngrievance that will be submitted to you upon my receiving response\n\nfrom   the   warden   and   my    [June   8th]   second   level   grievance.\"\n\nSubsequently on that same day, Warden Blaisdell responded to\n\nJohnson's June 8th level two grievance, writing:            \"What is it that\n\nyou actually want?       Do you want to [sic] PC?           Transfer out of\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fstate?    If we have to PC you[,] that can be done if the criteria is\n\nthere.\"\n\n            On June 19, Commissioner Wrenn replied to Johnson's June\n\n13th \"emergency\" grievance, stating \"Since this will not take the\n\nplace of the actual grievance you will file after receiving a\n\nresponse from the warden, I will wait for the actual grievance\n\nbefore I reply.\"\n\n            Johnson   never   filed    any    further   grievance   with   the\n\nCommissioner.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            Johnson, who had filed a § 1983 action in the federal\n\ndistrict court prior to the assault, amended that action to include\n\na claim that, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, Thyng had\n\nintentionally failed to protect Johnson from a known risk to his\n\nsafety by Thyng's June 5th refusal of his request for protective\n\ncustody.1     After   a   one-day     bench   trial,    the   district   court\n\nconcluded that this \"failure to protect\" claim was barred by a\n\nfailure to exhaust administrative remedies, as required by PLRA as\n\na condition precedent to suit.\n\n            PLRA provides:\n\n\n\n     1\n      The district court disposed of the other claims against other\ndefendants by way of summary judgment, leaving only the \"failure to\nprotect\" claim against Thyng. On appeal, Johnson raises no issues\nwith respect to the district court's resolution of his other\nclaims. Accordingly, we omit any description and discussion of\nthese other claims.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f                 No action shall be brought with\n                 respect to prison conditions under\n                 section 1983 of this title, or any\n                 other Federal law, by the prisoner\n                 confined in any jail, prison, or\n                 other correctional facility until\n                 such administrative remedies as are\n                 available are exhausted.\n\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).

His theory is that an optional\n\nlevel of administrative review need not be exhausted, that he has\n\nexhausted any mandatory component of the prison grievance system,\n\nand,       therefore,    he   has    complied     with    PLRA's    requirement   of\n\nexhaustion as a condition precedent to filing suit.\n\n               In support of his claim that the third level of NCF's\n\ngrievance process is not mandatory, Johnson relies on what he views\n\n\n\n       2\n      We need not address Johnson's contention that Thyng\ninterfered with his filing of his level two grievance with the\nwarden. For purposes of determining whether Johnson had complied\nwith the exhaustion requirement, the district court made several\nassumptions in Johnson's favor. First, there was some dispute as\nto whether Johnson used the proper grievance form.          Johnson\nasserted that he used an \"inmate request\" form because Thyng would\nnot give him a grievance form and threatened to retaliate against\nhim. The district court accepted Johnson's contention as true for\npurposes of its analysis and further accepted, for purposes of\nanalysis, that the fact that the grievance was filed on a request\nform, rather than a grievance form, was not determinative of\nwhether Johnson had complied with the exhaustion requirement.\nSecond, the court accepted Johnson's version of the facts regarding\nhis compliance with the first and second levels of the grievance\nprocedure and, so, assumed, in Johnson's favor, that he had\ncomplied with the grievance process through level two. We, too,\nmake these same assumptions in Johnson's favor.\n\n                                            -7-\n\fas permissive language in two documents: (1) the N.H. Department of\n\nCorrections Policy and Procedure Directive (\"PPD\") 1.16 IV C, says,\n\nin   relevant    part,   \"If   an    inmate      is   not    satisfied   with    the\n\nWarden/Director's response, he/she may file an appeal using the\n\ngrievance form, to the Commissioner's office\" (emphasis added) and\n\n(2) NCF's Inmate Manual Section D.3, says, in relevant part, \"if\n\nthe Warden has not solved the problem with his/her response, a\n\nfinal   grievance     form     may   be     sent      to    the   Commissioner    of\n\nCorrections\" (emphasis added).\n\n           Whatever the merits of Johnson's contention that level\n\nthree of the prison grievance process is optional, rather than\n\nmandatory, PLRA, nonetheless, speaks in terms of requiring that all\n\n\"available\" remedies be exhausted.               See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) (\"No\n\naction shall be brought ... until such administrative remedies as\n\nare available are exhausted\");            Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. at 524\n\n(\"All 'available' remedies must [] be exhausted.\").                  A level three\n\ngrievance directed to the Commissioner was \"available,\" even if not\n\nmandatory.      And, Johnson concedes he did not file one.\n\n           The emerging case law rejects Johnson's theory that an\n\noptional level of administrative review need not be exhausted for\n\npurposes of PLRA.        For example, the Sixth Circuit in Owens v.\n\nKeeling,   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795544\"><a href=\"/opinion/795544/orbain-owens-v-george-keeling/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span>    <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>   <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">    (6th      Cir.    2006),     concluded   that    the\n\npermissive language authorizing an appeal -- the prisoner \"may\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fappeal\"   a    classification   action     --   is   irrelevant    to   the\n\nconsideration of the exhaustion issue.\n\n                  \"Although    a   remedy    must   be\n                  'available' in order for a prisoner\n                  to be required to pursue it to\n                  exhaust his claim, ... this does not\n                  mean that the prison must require\n                  the prisoner to exhaust his remedies\n                  for the remedy to be 'available.'\n                  Generally, the prisoner would be\n                  free to choose not to exhaust his\n                  remedies; he would only be required\n                  to do so if he wants to file a\n                  complaint regarding the matter in\n                  federal court.\"\n\n\nId. at 770 n.4 (emphasis in the original; citations omitted).

N.J. June 9, 2004).\n\n           Thus,     even       assuming    that       Johnson     has    correctly\n\ncharacterized    the    third     level    of   NCF's    grievance       process   as\n\noptional, and not mandatory, a level three grievance directed to\n\nthe Commissioner was an \"available\" remedy for purposes of                     PLRA\n\nexhaustion.     Johnson's concession that he did not file one dooms\n\nhis § 1983 claim.\n\n           Johnson proffers an additional theory in support of his\n\ncontention    that   he     has   complied      with    PLRA's     requirement     of\n\nexhaustion as a condition precedent to filing suit. Johnson points\n\nout that the prison transferred his assailant, Bickham, to another\n\nprison   facility      before     the   conclusion      of   the   administrative\n\ngrievance process.        According to Johnson, since he achieved a\n\nfavorable outcome, he did not need to appeal the Warden's decision\n\nto the Commissioner and his \"available\" remedies were, therefore,\n\nexhausted.3   If, in fact, there was no pertinent additional relief\n\n\n     3\n      At the bench trial, Johnson's explanation for his failure to\ncomplete the third level of grievance was somewhat different. He\nexplained there that, because he had already been assaulted, he\nbelieved that filing that level of grievance would be futile. The\ndistrict court rejected that rationale on the basis of Booth v.\nChurner, 532 U.S. at 741 n.6 (rejecting a \"futility\" exception and\nholding that PLRA mandates exhaustion despite the fact that the\ngrievance process could not provide the inmate with money damages)\nand Medina-Claudio v.

Valoff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791854\"><a href=\"/opinion/791854/peter-brown-v-j-valoff-robert-hall-v-jw-fairman-jr-and-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 934-35 (9th Cir. 2005) (concluding that Booth made clear that\n\nexhaustion is not required when no pertinent relief can be obtained\n\nthrough the administrative process) (emphasis added).\n\n           Johnson's current claim of being satisfied with the\n\nprison transfer of Bickham, however, conflicts with the record. For\n\nexample, on June 13, two days after the assault by Bickham, Johnson\n\nwrote to Thyng stating that, even though Bickham had been sent to\n\nanother facility, he did not feel safe because of \"ongoing threats\n\nand rumors from Mr. Bickum [sic] friends and other inmates.\"\n\nJohnson's district court filings, as well, contradict Johnson's\n\ncurrent contention that he was satisfied with the transfer of\n\nBickham.      On   July   17,   Johnson   wrote   to   the   district    court,\n\ncontending that he was \"still afraid for [his] life.\"                   And, in\n\n\n\ni.e., that he was \"satisfied\" with the prison's response of\ntransferring Bickham, was not raised in the district court and is,\ntherefore, waived. As Johnson is pro se, we may grant him some\nleeway as to whether his current claim of being \"satisfied\" by the\ntransfer is but another way of describing the circumstances in the\nwake of the assault. In any event, we need not rely on the waiver\nargument as, for the reasons stated in the text, Johnson's\ncontention lacks merit.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fresponse to Thyng's motion for summary judgment, Johnson claimed\n\nthat, at the protective custody board when he was informed that\n\nBickham had been transferred, he responded: \"What about the other\n\ninmates that are after me or have heard the rumors?                   What about\n\n[Bickham's] brother that [sic] lives on D-Block?\"                  It is evident\n\nthat, contrary to Johnson's current assertion, he was not satisfied\n\nwith the prison transfer of Bickham.           And, in any event, Bickham's\n\ntransfer to a different facility did not constitute the only\n\navailable   relief,   such   that     the    administrative     process      could\n\nprovide no other pertinent relief. Given that Johnson persisted in\n\nclaiming the existence of threats from other inmates, the level\n\nthree of the grievance process was available to provide a remedy to\n\nrelieve   those   threats,    apart     from    the     transfer    of    Bickham.\n\nJohnson's failure to exhaust this level of the grievance process\n\nprecludes his current federal court claim.              See Ruggiero v. County\n\nof Orange, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 177 (2d Cir. 2006) (dismissal of § 1983\n\naction affirmed for failure to exhaust where inmate's transfer to\n\nanother   prison,   while    arguably       providing    him   with      relief   by\n\nseparating him from officers who allegedly mistreated him, did not\n\nprovide him with all of the relief available to him, since a formal\n\ngrievance might have resulted in developing policies and procedures\n\npertaining to the grievance of disciplining the officers).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f                              IV.\n\n          The judgment of the district court, entered on May 8,\n\n2009, is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -13-\n\f</pre>",
