Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney\nGeneral Michael B. Mukasey as the respondent.\n\f            LYNCH, Chief Judge.    Rammeash Ratnasingam, a native and\n\ncitizen of Sri Lanka, petitions this court for review both of an\n\norder of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") denying him\n\nrelief from removal and of an order denying his motion to reopen.\n\n            On January 31, 2008, the BIA affirmed the Immigration\n\nJudge's (\"IJ\") denial of Ratnasingam's applications for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (\"CAT\"), all based on his alleged persecution as an ethnic\n\nTamil by the majority Sinhalese ethnic group.       Ratnasingam's later\n\nmotion to reopen, which argued that conditions in Sri Lanka had\n\nworsened for Tamils, was denied on April 18, 2008.           We deny the\n\npetitions for review.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            When Ratnasingam attempted to enter the United States on\n\nMay 4, 2007 at the airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, immigration\n\nauthorities discovered that his passport contained a fraudulent\n\nvisa and detained him. Ratnasingam admitted to purchasing the visa\n\nfrom an agent in Sri Lanka but claimed he had not known it was\n\nfraudulent.    The government issued a Notice to Appear on May 23,\n\ncharging Ratnasingam with removability for seeking admission to the\n\nUnited States with a fraudulent visa and for lacking a valid entry\n\ndocument.     He   conceded   removability   and   applied   for   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and relief under the CAT.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f              At a hearing before an IJ on August 22, 2007, Ratnasingam\n\ntestified that he was born in Northeastern Sri Lanka in 1977.             He\n\nmoved to Colombo, where he operated a video store and earned money\n\nby photographing and videotaping weddings and other functions.\n\n              Ratnasingam testified about four incidents that he said\n\nformed the basis for his fear of returning to Sri Lanka.            The first\n\noccurred in May or June 2001, when three men in army uniforms\n\naccosted Ratnasingam as he returned to his shop after videotaping\n\na wedding.      The men took him to a camp, where they questioned him\n\nfor three hours.      They showed Ratnasingam several photographs and\n\nasked him if he had taken them or could identify the individuals in\n\nthem.    Ratnasingam stated that he had not taken the pictures and\n\ncould not identify the subjects.       The men then asked him if he or\n\nhis family supported the Liberation Tamil Tigers of Eelam (\"LTTE\"),\n\na Tamil separatist group. Ratnasingam denied any involvement. The\n\nmen did not harm Ratnasingam and they released him the following\n\nday.\n\n              The next incident occurred four years later.          In 2005,\n\nfour    men   who   identified   themselves   as   LTTE   members    entered\n\nRatnasingam's store.      They told him that they wanted him to stock\n\nand rent out LTTE propaganda CDs.         Ratnasingam refused.       The men\n\ntold him, \"you are a Tamil.       You must help the Tamils.\"        After he\n\ncontinued to refuse, the men told Ratnasingam not to videotape any\n\npolitical functions.      They threatened Ratnasingam that if he told\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fanyone what had happened, they would tell the Sri Lankan army that\n\nhe was involved with the LTTE.\n\n            On     April      18,   2006,     Ratnasingam's         brother-in-law,\n\nMahadevan Kishorkumar was killed near an army camp, but Ratnasingam\n\ndid   not   know       why   Kishorkumar      was    killed    or    who    did    it.\n\nKishorkumar, who had worked in Ratnasingam's shop, had left Colombo\n\nto celebrate the Tamil New Year with family.\n\n            Finally, in February 2007, Ratnasingam began to receive\n\nanonymous telephone calls demanding money and threatening that he\n\nwould be killed if he contacted the police.                 Ratnasingam had seen\n\nnews reports of individuals, all Tamils, who had disappeared and\n\nwho later turned up dead.           No person ever approached him, however,\n\nand he never discovered who made the calls or their reason.\n\nRatnasingam did not contact the police because he believed that\n\nthey would not help him.\n\n            Ratnasingam left Sri Lanka on April 14, 2007.                  Though he\n\ntraveled through five or six countries before arriving in Puerto\n\nRico several weeks later, Ratnasingam did not seek asylum in any of\n\nthese countries.\n\n            The    IJ's      oral   decision,    dated      September      27,    2007,\n\nconcluded that the incidents to which Ratnasingam testified did not\n\namount to persecution.         Ratnasingam was never physically harmed in\n\nany of the incidents he described.               The motive for the murder of\n\nKishorkumar      was    unknown.      The   IJ      found   Ratnasingam      had   not\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\festablished a pattern or practice of persecution of Tamils in Sri\n\nLanka, stating that even though there was \"evidence in the record\n\nthat Tamils are persecuted,\" Ratnasingam had \"failed to identify a\n\npersecutor [or] persecution as contemplated by case law,\" and\n\nrejected the CAT claim because he provided no evidence of torture.\n\nThe IJ did not reach the issue of whether Ratnasingam was credible.\n\n            The BIA affirmed on January 31, 2008, holding that\n\nRatnasingam's past experiences did not amount to persecution on\n\naccount of one of the protected grounds, and that Ratnasingam had\n\nfailed to establish a pattern or practice of persecution. It\n\naffirmed the IJ's denial of Ratnasingam's CAT claim, concluding\n\nthat there was nothing in the record to establish a probability of\n\ntorture.\n\n            The BIA denied Ratnasingam's later motion to reopen,\n\nconcluding that the purported \"new\" evidence Ratnasingam provided\n\nwas not unavailable at the prior hearing, but merely \"reiterated\n\nhis previous claim,\" and the claims lacked merit.         His claim that\n\nhe would face persecution as a failed asylum seeker constituted a\n\nchange     in   personal   circumstances   not   a   change   in   country\n\nconditions, and he could not establish persecution on the basis of\n\nmembership in either of two purported social groups –- failed\n\nasylum seekers or young male Tamils –- neither of which constituted\n\na social group under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f                  Ratnasingam filed separate petitions for review of the\n\nBIA's orders, which this court consolidated.1\n\n                                         II.\n\n                  Where the BIA has issued its own opinion without adopting\n\nthe IJ's findings, we review the BIA's decision. Lin v. Mukasey,\n\n521 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                  Ratnasingam incorrectly argues that our review is de\n\nnovo.        Whether an applicant has met his or her burden for proving\n\neligibility is a question of fact, reviewed under the substantial\n\nevidence standard.            Khan v. Mukasey, 541 F.3d 55, 58 (1st Cir.\n\n2008); see also Budiono v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).           We uphold the BIA's findings \"if they are 'supported by\n\nreasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole,'\" Budiono, 548 F.3d at 48 (quoting Sharari\n\nv. Gonzales, 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st Cir. 2005)), and will \"reverse\n\nonly if 'any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude\n\nto the contrary,'\" id. (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)).\n\n                  An applicant for asylum bears the burden of demonstrating\n\nthat he or she \"suffered past persecution or has a well-founded\n\nfear        of    future   persecution   based   on   one   of   five   enumerated\n\ngrounds.\"           Chikkeur v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 1381, 1382 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n        1\n          Ratnasingam also filed a motion for a stay of removal.\nThis court denied the motion on March 25, 2008, concluding that he\nwas not likely to succeed on the merits. See Arevalo v. Ashcroft,\n344 F.3d 1, 7-9 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                         -6-\n\f2008); see 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A) (defining \"refugee\" as one who\n\nsuffers persecution on the basis of \"race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion\").\n\nThe REAL ID Act, which applies to asylum applications filed after\n\nMay 11, 2005 such as Ratnasingam's, additionally requires that the\n\napplicant show that one of the statutory factors \"was or will be at\n\nleast one central reason for persecuting the applicant.\"             See id.\n\n§ 1158(b)(1)(B)(i), as amended by Pub. L. No. 109-13, § 101(a), 119\n\nStat. 231, 302-03 (2005).\n\n              The record simply does not compel the conclusion that\n\nRatnasingam \"was subjected to systematic maltreatment rising to the\n\nlevel    of   persecution,    as   opposed    to   a   series   of   isolated\n\nincidents.\" Topalli v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 128, 132 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(affirming denial of asylum to applicant who had been arrested and\n\nbeaten seven times in his home country).           His encounters with the\n\nSri Lankan army in 2001 and the LTTE in 2005 are insufficient.\n\nExperiences that do not \"rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and\n\neven basic suffering\" are not persecution. Khalil v. Ashcroft, 337\n\nF.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258,\n\n263 (1st Cir. 2000)).        Ratnasingam was detained once by the army\n\nand released without being harmed.           He was accosted in his store\n\nonce by LTTE members and was again physically unharmed.              Although\n\nhe was threatened after each incident, he never saw any of the men\n\nagain.    See Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 759 (1st Cir. 1992)\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f(holding that substantial evidence supported the denial of asylum\n\nto a Tamil Sri Lankan in part because he remained in the country\n\nwithout incident for one year after the alleged persecution).\n\nFurther,    he    never   reported    any    encounters   with     LTTE   or    army\n\npersonnel in the years he remained in Sri Lanka.\n\n            The requirement that one of the statutory factors be a\n\n\"central reason for persecuting the applicant\" means Ratnasingam\n\ncannot establish past persecution on the basis of Kishorkumar's\n\nmurder (for unknown reasons) or the anonymous telephone calls.\n\nNothing in the record compels the conclusion that the anonymous\n\ncaller targeted Ratnasingam \"for anything other than economic\n\nmotives.\"    Chikkeur, 514 F.3d at 1383.            Similarly, the record does\n\nnot compel a finding that Kishorkumar's killers acted on account of\n\none of the statutory grounds; it is completely silent on their\n\nmotive.     \"Because the motive for the persecution is critical, a\n\npetitioner       'must    provide    some     evidence    of     it,   direct    or\n\ncircumstantial.'\" Khalil, 337 F.3d at 55 (emphasis added) (quoting\n\nINS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 483 (1992)).\n\n            Ratnasingam      also    failed    to    establish    a    pattern    or\n\npractice of persecution.             A petitioner that does not provide\n\nevidence that he or she will be singled out for persecution may\n\nstill qualify for asylum by establishing that there is a \"pattern\n\nor practice in his or her country . . . of persecution of a group\n\nof persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of\" the\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fstatutory grounds.      8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(2)(iii)(A).   Ratnasingam\n\nargues that because the IJ made findings that \"he is a Tamil\" and\n\nthat \"there is evidence in the record that Tamils are persecuted,\"\n\nthe IJ and the BIA erred in denying him asylum.         The IJ did not,\n\nhowever, find there was a pattern or practice of persecution, but\n\nrather that his evidence failed to establish any such pattern.\n\n            The   BIA    committed    no   error   in   affirming   this\n\ndetermination. \"That a group suffers due to violent civil conflict\n\n. . . in the home country does not suffice to establish a pattern\n\nor practice\" of persecution.      Kho v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 50, 54 (1st\n\nCir. 2007) (quoting Meguenine v. INS, 139 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir.\n\n1998)); see also Velasquez-Valencia v. INS, 244 F.3d 48, 51 (1st\n\nCir. 2001) (\"Congress has chosen to define asylum as limited to\n\ncertain categories; . . . it has not generally opened the doors to\n\nthose merely fleeing from civil war.\").      Moreover, in Ravindran, a\n\ncase that involved an asylum claim by a Sri Lankan Tamil, this\n\ncourt noted that \"evidence of widespread violence and human rights\n\nviolations affecting all citizens is insufficient to establish\n\npersecution.\"     Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 759.\n\n            Because Ratnasingam \"cannot meet the lower burden of\n\nproof for establishing his eligibility for asylum, he therefore\n\ncannot satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of\n\nremoval.\"    Sinurat v. Mukasey, 537 F.3d 59, 62 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f             As to the CAT claim, Ratnasingam argues that, regardless\n\nof his failure to prove or provide any evidence of past torture, it\n\nis more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned, based\n\non country conditions, the facts that \"his photograph was taken by\n\nthe Sri Lankan authorities in 2001, . . . [that] he is returning\n\nfrom a foreign country, . . . [and that] he is a failed asylum\n\nseeker,\" and a report that an LTTE member who was returned in\n\nOctober 2003 was tortured. The record does not compel a conclusion\n\nthat it is more likely than not that Ratnasingam, who was never an\n\nLTTE member, would be tortured if returned.              His claim is wholly\n\nspeculative.    See Chhay v. Mukasey, 540 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                                     III.\n\n             The BIA also did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\nRatnasingam's motion to reopen. See Zeru v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 59,\n\n71 (1st Cir. 2007).        Motions to reopen deportation proceedings are\n\ndisfavored    due     to   the   strong   public    interest   in   concluding\n\nlitigation.     Id.\n\n             A motion to reopen deportation proceedings must state\n\n\"the new facts that will be proven . . . if the motion is granted\"\n\nand   must   demonstrate     that   \"evidence   sought    to   be   offered   is\n\nmaterial and was not available and could not have been discovered\n\nor presented at the former hearing.\"               8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fRatnasingam    failed   to   state     any   new,    material   facts.2    The\n\ndocumentary evidence that he submitted, including the 2008 State\n\nDepartment    country   report,      did     not    demonstrate    intensified\n\npersecution but mirrored evidence submitted in support of his\n\noriginal application.\n\n            The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that\n\nhis status as a failed asylum seeker constituted changed personal\n\ncircumstances rather than changed country conditions, or in finding\n\nthe claim was not new, having been made to the IJ.\n\n            Ratnasingam incorrectly argues that the BIA applied the\n\nwrong legal standard to his motion to reopen and that his burden\n\nwas merely to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief.\n\nPrima facie eligibility for relief is only one of the two threshold\n\nrequirements for a motion to reopen. Fesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d\n\n13, 20 (1st Cir. 2003). Ratnasingam's failure to establish that he\n\nmet   the   second   threshold    --    that   of    introducing    previously\n\nunavailable, material evidence -- dooms his claim.\n\n                                       IV.\n\n            The petitions for review are denied.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n          Because the BIA supportably denied Ratnasingam's motion\non these grounds, we need not address its separate conclusion that\nRatnasingam failed to establish that \"failed asylum seekers\" or\n\"young male Tamils\" constituted social groups within the meaning of\nthe Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\n                                     -11-\n\f",

In 2005, four men who identified themselves as LTTE members entered Ratnasingam's store. They told him that they wanted him to stock and rent out LTTE propaganda CDs. Ratnasingam refused. The men told him, \"you are a Tamil. You must help the Tamils.\" After he continued to refuse, the men told Ratnasingam not to videotape any political functions. They threatened Ratnasingam that if he told anyone what had happened, they would tell the Sri Lankan army that he was involved with the LTTE.</p>\n<p>On April 18, 2006, Ratnasingam's brother-in-law, Mahadevan Kishorkumar was killed near an army camp, but Ratnasingam did not know why Kishorkumar was killed or who did it. Kishorkumar, who had worked in Ratnasingam's shop, had left Colombo to celebrate the Tamil New Year with family.</p>\n<p>Finally, in February 2007, Ratnasingam began to receive anonymous telephone calls demanding money and threatening that he would be killed if he contacted the police. Ratnasingam had seen news reports of individuals, all Tamils, who had disappeared and who later turned up dead. No person ever approached him, however, and he never discovered who made the calls or their reason. Ratnasingam did not contact the police because he believed that they would not help him.</p>\n<p>Ratnasingam left Sri Lanka on April 14, 2007. Though he traveled through five or six countries before arriving in Puerto Rico several weeks later, Ratnasingam did not seek asylum in any of these countries.</p>\n<p>The IJ's oral decision, dated September 27, 2007, concluded that the incidents to which Ratnasingam testified did not amount to persecution. Ratnasingam was never physically harmed in any of the incidents he described. The motive for the murder of Kishorkumar was unknown. The IJ found Ratnasingam had not established <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> a pattern or practice of persecution of Tamils in Sri Lanka, stating that even though there was \"evidence in the record that Tamils are persecuted,\" Ratnasingam had \"failed to identify a persecutor [or] persecution as contemplated by case law,\" and rejected the CAT claim because he provided no evidence of torture. The IJ did not reach the issue of whether Ratnasingam was credible.</p>\n<p>The BIA affirmed on January 31, 2008, holding that Ratnasingam's past experiences did not amount to persecution on account of one of the protected grounds, and that Ratnasingam had failed to establish a pattern or practice of persecution. It affirmed the IJ's denial of Ratnasingam's CAT claim, concluding that there was nothing in the record to establish a probability of torture.</p>\n<p>The BIA denied Ratnasingam's later motion to reopen, concluding that the purported \"new\" evidence Ratnasingam provided was not unavailable at the prior hearing, but merely \"reiterated his previous claim,\" and the claims lacked merit. His claim that he would face persecution as a failed asylum seeker constituted a change in personal circumstances not a change in country conditions, and he could not establish persecution on the basis of membership in either of two purported social groupsfailed asylum seekers or young male Tamilsneither of which constituted a social group under the Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>\n<p>Ratnasingam filed separate petitions for review of the BIA's orders, which this court consolidated.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Where the BIA has issued its own opinion without adopting the IJ's findings, we review the BIA's decision. <i>Lin v. Mukasey,</i> 521 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Ratnasingam incorrectly argues that our review is de novo. Whether an applicant has met his or her burden for proving eligibility is a question of fact, reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <i>Khan v. Mukasey,</i> 541 F.3d 55, 58 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see also </i><i>Budiono v. Mukasey,</i> 548 F.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir.2008). We uphold the BIA's findings \"if they are `supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,'\" <i>Budiono,</i> 548 F.3d at 48 (quoting <i>Sharari v. Gonzales,</i> 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st Cir.2005)), and will \"reverse only if `any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,'\" <i>id.</i> (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)).</p>\n<p>An applicant for asylum bears the burden of demonstrating that he or she \"suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on one of five enumerated grounds.\" <i>Chikkeur v. Mukasey,</i> 514 F.3d 1381, 1382 (1st Cir. 2008); <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A) (defining \"refugee\" as one who suffers persecution on the basis of \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion\"). The REAL ID Act, which applies to asylum applications filed after May 11, 2005 such as Ratnasingam's, additionally requires that the applicant show that one of the statutory factors \"was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.\" <i>See id.</i> § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i), <i>as amended by</i> Pub.L. No. 109-13, § 101(a), 119 Stat. 231, 302-03 (2005).</p>\n<p>The record simply does not compel the conclusion that Ratnasingam \"was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> subjected to systematic maltreatment rising to the level of persecution, as opposed to a series of isolated incidents.\" <i>Topalli v. Gonzales,</i> 417 F.3d 128, 132 (1st Cir. 2005) (affirming denial of asylum to applicant who had been arrested and beaten seven times in his home country). His encounters with the Sri Lankan army in 2001 and the LTTE in 2005 are insufficient. Experiences that do not \"rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering\" are not persecution. <i>Khalil v. Ashcroft,</i> 337 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>Nelson v. INS,</i> 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir.2000)). Ratnasingam was detained once by the army and released without being harmed. He was accosted in his store once by LTTE members and was again physically unharmed. Although he was threatened after each incident, he never saw any of the men again. <i>See </i><i>Ravindran v. INS,</i> 976 F.2d 754, 759 (1st Cir.1992) (holding that substantial evidence supported the denial of asylum to a Tamil Sri Lankan in part because he remained in the country without incident for one year after the alleged persecution). Further, he never reported any encounters with LTTE or army personnel in the years he remained in Sri Lanka.</p>\n<p>The requirement that one of the statutory factors be a \"central reason for persecuting the applicant\" means Ratnasingam cannot establish past persecution on the basis of Kishorkumar's murder (for unknown reasons) or the anonymous telephone calls. Nothing in the record compels the conclusion that the anonymous caller targeted Ratnasingam \"for anything other than economic motives.\" <i>Chikkeur,</i> 514 F.3d at 1383. Similarly, the record does not compel a finding that Kishorkumar's killers acted on account of one of the statutory grounds; it is completely silent on their motive. \"Because the motive for the persecution is critical, a petitioner `must provide <i>some</i> evidence of it, direct or circumstantial.'\" <i>Khalil,</i> 337 F.3d at 55 (emphasis added) (quoting <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)).</p>\n<p>Ratnasingam also failed to establish a pattern or practice of persecution. A petitioner that does not provide evidence that he or she will be singled out for persecution may still qualify for asylum by establishing that there is a \"pattern or practice in his or her country ... of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of\" the statutory grounds. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(2)(iii)(A). Ratnasingam argues that because the IJ made findings that \"he is a Tamil\" and that \"there is evidence in the record that Tamils are persecuted,\" the IJ and the BIA erred in denying him asylum. The IJ did not, however, find there was a pattern or practice of persecution, but rather that his evidence failed to establish any such pattern.</p>\n<p>The BIA committed no error in affirming this determination. \"That a group suffers due to violent civil conflict... in the home country does not suffice to establish a pattern or practice\" of persecution. <i>Kho v. Keisler,</i> 505 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>Meguenine v. INS,</i> 139 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir.1998)); <i>see also </i><i>Velasquez-Valencia v. INS,</i> 244 F.3d 48, 51 (1st Cir.2001) (\"Congress has chosen to define asylum as limited to certain categories;... it has not generally opened the doors to those merely fleeing from civil war.\"). Moreover, in <i>Ravindran,</i> a case that involved an asylum claim by a Sri Lankan Tamil, this court noted that \"evidence of widespread violence and human rights violations affecting all citizens is insufficient to establish persecution.\" <i>Ravindran,</i> 976 F.2d at 759.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> Because Ratnasingam \"cannot meet the lower burden of proof for establishing his eligibility for asylum, he therefore cannot satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal.\" <i>Sinurat v. Mukasey,</i> 537 F.3d 59, 62 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>As to the CAT claim, Ratnasingam argues that, regardless of his failure to prove or provide any evidence of past torture, it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned, based on country conditions, the facts that \"his photograph was taken by the Sri Lankan authorities in 2001, ... [that] he is returning from a foreign country, ... [and that] he is a failed asylum seeker,\" and a report that an LTTE member who was returned in October 2003 was tortured. The record does not compel a conclusion that it is more likely than not that Ratnasingam, who was never an LTTE member, would be tortured if returned. His claim is wholly speculative. <i>See </i><i>Chhay v. Mukasey,</i> 540 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The BIA also did not abuse its discretion in denying Ratnasingam's motion to reopen. <i>See </i><i>Zeru v. Gonzales,</i> 503 F.3d 59, 71 (1st Cir.2007). Motions to reopen deportation proceedings are disfavored due to the strong public interest in concluding litigation. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>A motion to reopen deportation proceedings must state \"the new facts that will be proven ... if the motion is granted\" and must demonstrate that \"evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Ratnasingam failed to state any new, material facts.<sup>[2]</sup> The documentary evidence that he submitted, including the 2008 State Department country report, did not demonstrate intensified persecution but mirrored evidence submitted in support of his original application.</p>\n<p>The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that his status as a failed asylum seeker constituted changed personal circumstances rather than changed country conditions, or in finding the claim was not new, having been made to the IJ.</p>\n<p>Ratnasingam incorrectly argues that the BIA applied the wrong legal standard to his motion to reopen and that his burden was merely to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief. Prima facie eligibility for relief is only one of the <i>two</i> threshold requirements for a motion to reopen. <i>Fesseha v. Ashcroft,</i> 333 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir.2003). Ratnasingam's failure to establish that he met the second thresholdthat of introducing previously unavailable, material evidencedooms his claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>The petitions for review are <i>denied.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey as the respondent.</p>\n<p>[1]  Ratnasingam also filed a motion for a stay of removal. This court denied the motion on March 25, 2008, concluding that he was not likely to succeed on the merits. <i>See </i><i>Arevalo v. Ashcroft,</i> 344 F.3d 1, 7-9 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>[2]  Because the BIA supportably denied Ratnasingam's motion on these grounds, we need not address its separate conclusion that Ratnasingam failed to establish that \"failed asylum seekers\" or \"young male Tamils\" constituted social groups within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>\n\n</div>",

Ratnasingam's later motion to reopen, which argued that conditions in Sri Lanka had worsened for Tamils, was denied on April 18, 2008. We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> I.</h2>\n<p>When Ratnasingam attempted to enter the United States on May 4, 2007 at the airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, immigration authorities discovered that his passport contained a fraudulent visa and detained him. Ratnasingam admitted to purchasing the visa from an agent in Sri Lanka but claimed he had not known it was fraudulent. The government issued a Notice to Appear on May 23, charging Ratnasingam with removability for seeking admission to the United States with a fraudulent visa and for lacking a valid entry document. He conceded removability and applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p>At a hearing before an IJ on August 22, 2007, Ratnasingam testified that he was born in Northeastern Sri Lanka in 1977. He moved to Colombo, where he operated a video store and earned money by photographing and videotaping weddings and other functions.</p>\n<p>Ratnasingam testified about four incidents that he said formed the basis for his fear of returning to Sri Lanka. The first occurred in May or June 2001, when three men in army uniforms accosted Ratnasingam as he returned to his shop after videotaping a wedding. The men took him to a camp, where they questioned him for three hours. They showed Ratnasingam several photographs and asked him if he had taken them or could identify the individuals in them. Ratnasingam stated that he had not taken the pictures and could not identify the subjects. The men then asked him if he or his family supported the Liberation Tamil Tigers of Eelam (\"LTTE\"), a Tamil separatist group. Ratnasingam denied any involvement. The men did not harm Ratnasingam and they released him the following day.</p>\n<p>The next incident occurred four years later. In 2005, four men who identified themselves as LTTE members entered Ratnasingam's store. They told him that they wanted him to stock and rent out LTTE propaganda CDs. Ratnasingam refused.

Moreover, in <i>Ravindran,</i> a case that involved an asylum claim by a Sri Lankan Tamil, this court noted that \"evidence of widespread violence and human rights violations affecting all citizens is insufficient to establish persecution.\" <i>Ravindran,</i> 976 F.2d at 759.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> Because Ratnasingam \"cannot meet the lower burden of proof for establishing his eligibility for asylum, he therefore cannot satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal.\" <i>Sinurat v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203431\"><a href=\"/opinion/203431/sinurat-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>As to the CAT claim, Ratnasingam argues that, regardless of his failure to prove or provide any evidence of past torture, it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned, based on country conditions, the facts that \"his photograph was taken by the Sri Lankan authorities in 2001, ... [that] he is returning from a foreign country, ... [and that] he is a failed asylum seeker,\" and a report that an LTTE member who was returned in October 2003 was tortured. The record does not compel a conclusion that it is more likely than not that Ratnasingam, who was never an LTTE member, would be tortured if returned. His claim is wholly speculative. <i>See </i><i>Chhay v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203441\"><a href=\"/opinion/203441/chhay-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The BIA also did not abuse its discretion in denying Ratnasingam's motion to reopen. <i>See </i><i>Zeru v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></span>, 71 (1st Cir.2007). Motions to reopen deportation proceedings are disfavored due to the strong public interest in concluding litigation. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>A motion to reopen deportation proceedings must state \"the new facts that will be proven ... if the motion is granted\" and must demonstrate that \"evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Ratnasingam failed to state any new, material facts.<sup>[2]</sup> The documentary evidence that he submitted, including the 2008 State Department country report, did not demonstrate intensified persecution but mirrored evidence submitted in support of his original application.</p>\n<p>The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that his status as a failed asylum seeker constituted changed personal circumstances rather than changed country conditions, or in finding the claim was not new, having been made to the IJ.</p>\n<p>Ratnasingam incorrectly argues that the BIA applied the wrong legal standard to his motion to reopen and that his burden was merely to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief. Prima facie eligibility for relief is only one of the <i>two</i> threshold requirements for a motion to reopen. <i>Fesseha v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2003). Ratnasingam's failure to establish that he met the second thresholdthat of introducing previously unavailable, material evidencedooms his claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>The petitions for review are <i>denied.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey as the respondent.</p>\n<p>[1]  Ratnasingam also filed a motion for a stay of removal. This court denied the motion on March 25, 2008, concluding that he was not likely to succeed on the merits. <i>See </i><i>Arevalo v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200622\"><a href=\"/opinion/200622/arevalo-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7-9 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>[2]  Because the BIA supportably denied Ratnasingam's motion on these grounds, we need not address its separate conclusion that Ratnasingam failed to establish that \"failed asylum seekers\" or \"young male Tamils\" constituted social groups within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>\n\n</div>",
