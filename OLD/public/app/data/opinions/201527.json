In the course of a civil rights\n\naction, the district court determined that three attorneys for the\n\nplaintiff had violated Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure.      The court revoked the pro hac vice status of the two\n\nattorneys who were not members of the court's bar and formally\n\ncensured one of the two.      Young v. City of Providence, 301 F. Supp.\n\n2d 187 (D.R.I. 2004).      In this decision, we address appeals by all\n\nthree attorneys; the merits of the civil rights action are the\n\nsubject   of    the   plaintiff’s    separate      appeal    resolved     in    our\n\ncompanion      decision   issued    today    sub   nom.     Young   v.   City   of\n\nProvidence.\n\n             The civil rights action grew out of a tragedy that\n\noccurred in January 2000 in Providence, Rhode Island.                Two police\n\nofficers (Michael Solitro and Carlos Saraiva), responding to the\n\nscene of a nighttime disturbance at a restaurant, shot and killed\n\nan off-duty officer-–Cornel Young, Jr., who, with his weapon drawn,\n\nwas attempting to assist them.              In June 2001, Young’s mother,\n\nacting on her own behalf and as executor of Young's estate, brought\n\na civil rights action in district court asserting claims under\n\nsection 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000), and under state law, against\n\nthe city, various officials and the two officers.\n\n             The case, assigned to Judge Mary Lisi, was a complex one.\n\nThis was due in part to the difficulty in reconstructing exactly\n\nwhat had happened in the nighttime encounter, in part to the\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fdifferent tiers of liability asserted against various defendants\n\n(direct, supervisory and municipal) and in part to plaintiff's aim\n\nto show a pattern or policy of incompetent hiring and inadequate\n\ntraining.    Both Barry Scheck and Nicholas Brustin of the New York\n\nfirm of Cochran, Neufeld & Scheck LLP were admitted pro hac vice to\n\nrepresent the plaintiff; Robert Mann of the Providence firm of Mann\n\n& Mitchell acted as local counsel. Scheck was admitted, to replace\n\nhis partner Johnnie Cochran, Jr., only in September 2003--shortly\n\nbefore a “phase I” trial was to begin focusing on the conduct of\n\nSolitro and Saraiva.\n\n            The litigation was the subject of extensive publicity;\n\namong other facets, the officers who fired the shots were white\n\nwhile Cornel Young was black (and the son of a senior Providence\n\npolice officer).         Scheck, who acted as lead counsel after his\n\nadmission,    was   at   odds   with    the   district    judge   over   various\n\nmatters, including the division of the trial into two phases.                Yet\n\nthe incident that gave rise to the Rule 11 findings, censure and\n\nrevocation of pro hac vice status was narrowly focused and arose\n\nagainst the following background.\n\n             By   September     2003,     extensive      discovery   had    been\n\nconducted.    One of the issues in the discovery, and in the ensuing\n\ntrial, concerned the precise movements of Cornel Young and of\n\nSolitro.     The former had been inside the restaurant; Solitro and\n\nSaraiva had approached the building through the parking lot to find\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fa man (later identified as Aldrin Diaz, who had caused an earlier\n\ndisturbance) pointing a gun out of the window of a Chevrolet Camaro\n\nparked in the lot in front of the restaurant.       Solitro broke cover\n\nand started toward the car.     Young, moving to assist, emerged from\n\nthe restaurant with his own weapon drawn and was shot by Solitro\n\nand Saraiva.     Just where Young and Solitro had stood and moved had\n\na bearing on who was at fault in the episode.\n\n           During discovery, Solitro had drawn a line indicating his\n\nown movement in relation to other physical landmarks including the\n\nCamaro; the line was drawn on a clear overlay laid atop a made-to-\n\nscale diagram prepared by the state attorney general in his own\n\ninvestigation.     Scheck planned to rely importantly on the diagram\n\nin his opening to explain to the jury the defense version of what\n\nhad happened.     However, in September 2003, out-takes filmed by a\n\nlocal TV station on the night of the shooting became available and,\n\nfrom   defense   counsel's   viewpoint,   raised   questions   about   the\n\naccuracy of the diagram–-at least as to the location of the Camaro.\n\nUntil then it had apparently been expected that both sides would\n\nagree to the admission of the diagram.\n\n           At the final pre-trial conference on September 19, 2003,\n\nthe district court was told briefly that there was a dispute about\n\nthe diagram.     Defense counsel later recalled advising Brustin on\n\nSeptember 25 or 26 of the specific discrepancy but Scheck later\n\nsaid that he did not fully understand the problem until October 7,\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f2003, when the jury was being selected.    Defense counsel then told\n\nthe district judge that the defense objected to the diagram as\n\ninconsistent with photographs made from the out-takes, and the\n\njudge responded that the parties should confer to see whether they\n\ncould stipulate as to the matter.      The judge told plaintiff's\n\ncounsel: \"If you can't agree to a stipulation on that, then I'm\n\ngoing to have to tell you to stay away from it because you're going\n\nto need testimony to explain it to the jury.\"\n\n          Scheck then offered as a compromise to stipulate that the\n\ndiagram conflicted with photographs made from the film out-takes,\n\nbut the next morning defense counsel declined the offer.     Scheck\n\nagain sought unsuccessfully to persuade the judge that he ought to\n\nbe allowed to refer to the diagram in the opening.    Then, with the\n\nopening statements about to begin, Scheck signed a stipulation\n\ndrafted by defense counsel that the diagram was inaccurate as to\n\nthe location of the Camaro and that the actual alignment of the car\n\nwas as described in the stipulation.      On this basis, Scheck was\n\nallowed to use the diagram in the opening, but he was not allowed\n\nthereafter to elicit testimony contradicting the stipulation.\n\n          Over the next several days of trial, further examination\n\nof the photographs persuaded Scheck and his colleagues that the\n\nout-takes did not contradict the diagram.      A young associate at\n\nScheck's firm was told to draft a memorandum to support a motion\n\nseeking relief from the stipulation on grounds of mistake.       The\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fmemorandum was filed with the court on October 16, 2003 in mid-\n\ntrial, after being reviewed and then signed by all three counsel–-\n\nScheck, Brustin and Mann.1   That same morning the judge directed\n\ncounsel to re-read the memorandum, saying that she was disturbed by\n\nrepresentations made in the memorandum, \"particularly as they\n\nrelate to the actions of the court.\"\n\n          The memorandum, set forth in full at 301 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n199-204, started with an introductory paragraph that conflated the\n\nearlier events by saying that counsel had believed prior to trial\n\nthat the diagram could be used at trial and then continued:\n\n          It was only on the eve of opening statements,\n          once plaintiff had prepared her entire opening\n          based on that stipulation, that defendants\n          first said they would not stipulate to Exhibit\n          18, based on two new photographs they had\n          found, Exhibits X and Y. Plaintiff, moments\n          before her opening, was informed by the Court\n          she had to agree to defendants’ stipulation.\n          Plaintiff was genuinely confused about the\n          import of photographs X and Y.     Plaintiff's\n          opening relied critically on using that\n          exhibit to explain events to the jury.      In\n          this state of confusion and uncertainty,\n          plaintiff felt little choice but to accept any\n          stipulation defendant provided.\n\nId. at 200.\n\n          Thereafter, the memorandum provided a much more detailed\n\nrecitation of events, together with legal arguments to justify\n\nrelief from the stipulation entered into in such circumstances.\n\n\n     1\n      A further version, correcting typographical errors, was filed\nlater that day. The differences between the two versions are not\nmaterial to these appeals.\n\n                               -7-\n\fLater, the memorandum blamed defense counsel for rejecting Scheck's\n\nOctober   7     compromise    stipulation,          adding    that   \"[u]nder   the\n\ncircumstances, plaintiff had no choice but to sign a stipulation\n\nwithout any chance to review the photographs at issue.”                     Id. at\n\n208. It there quoted a well known treatise that \"'courts will look\n\nat the facts carefully to see that one litigant has not been\n\ncoerced into the stipulation.'\"           Id. at 208 n.5 (quoting 22 Wright\n\n& Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure § 5194 (1978)).\n\n             After filing the motion and then hearing the judge's\n\nstatement      that   she    was     disturbed       by     its   representations,\n\nplaintiff's counsel returned to their office after the trial ended\n\nfor the day and, assertedly unable to determine what had so\n\ntroubled the judge, prepared a letter of general apology, which was\n\nimmediately delivered to court. It apologized for any misstatement\n\nand said that \"we do not seek to shift responsibility to the Court\n\n[for   the     stipulation],       and   if    we    have    created   a   contrary\n\nimpression, we are sorry.\"               It did not withdraw any specific\n\nstatement; plaintiff's counsel's position is that at that time they\n\ndid not fully appreciate what had so concerned the district judge.\n\n              The following morning, during argument on the motion for\n\nrelief from the stipulation, the judge made clear her view that\n\n\"the reference [in the memorandum] to the Court instructing you\n\nthat you had to stipulate is, again, a misrepresentation.\"                   Scheck\n\nnow sought to explain that he had been misunderstood, but the judge\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fdenied the motion for relief from the stipulation.     Later that day\n\nthe court called counsel before it and ruled that, based on the\n\nmemorandum's misrepresentation, the pro hac vice admissions of\n\nScheck and Brustin were revoked.      Mann was directed to proceed to\n\nrepresent plaintiff at the trial.        The trial proceeded to its\n\ncompletion and to a final judgment on February 12, 2004.\n\n           After the trial but before final judgment was entered,\n\nthe district court on November 7, 2003, issued a show cause order\n\nto the three plaintiff's counsel.      The order said that all three\n\ncounsel had violated Rule 11(b)(3)2 and directed the parties to\n\nshow cause why sanctions should not be imposed.      Counsel filed a\n\nmemorandum and affidavits arguing that they had had no deceptive\n\nintent and that, read as a whole and in context, their memorandum\n\nasking to withdraw the stipulation had not misrepresented any\n\nfacts.    The Rhode Island Bar Association filed an amicus brief in\n\nsupport of the lawyers; the ACLU also sought unsuccessfully to do\n\nso.\n\n           On December 15, 2003, the district court held hearings on\n\nthe show cause order, first agreeing to modify the show cause order\n\nto say only that it \"appears\" that plaintiff's counsel had violated\n\n\n\n      2\n      This provision requires that in every pleading, or motion or\nother filing counsel's signature is a representation that \"the\nallegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support\nor, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary\nsupport after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or\ndiscovery.”\n\n                                -9-\n\fRule 11.   On February 11, 2004, the court issued an order finding\n\nthat all three counsel had violated Rule 11.             In describing the\n\nbackground,    the   February   11   order   pointed     out   that   defense\n\ncounsel's version of events suggested that plaintiff's counsel had\n\nenjoyed more detailed and specific warnings that the defense\n\ndisputed the accuracy of the diagram than had previously been\n\nadvertised.    However, the judge did not resolve any disputes on\n\nthis score or rely upon such omissions in finding the Rule 11\n\nviolations.\n\n           Rather, the Rule 11 findings focused solely upon two\n\nspecific \"misrepresentations\" in the memorandum: one was the above\n\nblock-quoted     language   including        the   key     statement     that\n\n\"[p]laintiff, moments before her opening, was informed by the Court\n\nshe had to agree to defendants' stipulation.\"            301 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n200.   The other was the statement that defense counsel \"had no\n\nchoice\" but to sign the stipulation without any chance to review\n\nthe photographs.     Id. at 208.      Both statements, said the court,\n\nfalsely indicated that the court had ordered the stipulation to be\n\nsigned; and, the court noted, the memorandum's references to\n\ninjustice and coercion gave the impression that the court was\n\nresponsible for such wrongs.\n\n           The court accepted that the memorandum had been drafted\n\nby a young associate and that plaintiff's counsel had denied\n\ninstructing the younger lawyer to say that the court had directed\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fthe stipulation.         However, the court said that plaintiff's counsel\n\nwere responsible under Rule 11 for statements made in a memorandum\n\nthat       they   had        reviewed   and    signed.      Assessing    relative\n\nresponsibility, the court sanctioned Scheck by imposing \"a public\n\ncensure,\" 301 F. Supp. 2d at 198; Brustin, an associate whom the\n\ncourt said took direction from Scheck, was merely \"admonished\" to\n\nbe more careful, id.; and as to Mann, whose role was ascribed to\n\n\"inattention,\" id. at 199, the court said that his reputation in\n\nRhode Island for integrity was well established and a sanction was\n\nunnecessary to deter repetition.\n\n              All three of plaintiff's counsel have appealed from the\n\norder determining that they committed Rule 11 violations, and\n\nScheck and Brustin have asked that their censure and admonition be\n\noverturned and their pro hac vice status restored.                  In our view,\n\nthe Rule 11 findings are appealable, being distinguishable from\n\nmere criticism, and, so too, the censure and admonition.3                  Nor is\n\nthe request for reinstatement of pro hac vice status moot since the\n\nmerits      appeal      in    the   civil     rights   action   keeps   alive   the\n\npossibility of further district court proceedings.                 We turn, then,\n\n\n       3\n      Compare In re Williams, 156 F.3d 86, 92 (1st Cir. 1998)\n(holding that \"a jurist's derogatory comments about a lawyer's\nconduct, without more, do not constitute a[n appealable]\nsanction\"), with Precision Specialty Metals, Inc. v. United States,\n315 F.3d 1346, 1351-52 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (distinguishing Williams\nwhere court found that attorney had violated Rule 11), and United\nStates v. Talao, 222 F.3d 1133, 1137-38 (9th Cir. 2000)\n(distinguishing Williams where court found that attorney had\nviolated ethical rule).\n\n                                            -11-\n\fto the central issue-–underlying all of the requests for relief–-\n\nwhether the Rule 11 findings were justified.\n\n             The standard that applies on review of Rule 11 orders was\n\nestablished by the Supreme Court in 1990 and only recently glossed\n\nin our decision in Obert v. Republic W. Ins. Co., 398 F.3d 138 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).     Formally, it is \"abuse of discretion\" as to either\n\nviolation or sanction; but both a mistake of law and a clearly\n\nerroneous finding of fact constitute such an abuse.           Cooter & Gell\n\nv. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 402 (1990).         In this case, defense\n\ncounsel make two principal arguments as to the Rule 11 findings:\n\none relates to the substantive legal standard to be applied under\n\nRule 11 where the court initiates the inquiry into a possible\n\nviolation; the other is whether, under the proper standard, the\n\nobjected-to statements violated Rule 11. We consider the issues in\n\nthis order.\n\n             Rule 11(b) is not a strict liability provision. It\n\nprohibits filings made with \"any improper purpose,\" the offering of\n\n\"frivolous\" arguments, and the assertion of factual allegations\n\nwithout \"evidentiary support\" or the \"likely\" prospect of such\n\nsupport.     A lawyer who makes an inaccurate factual representation\n\nmust,   at   the   very   least,   be   culpably   careless   to    commit   a\n\nviolation.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b) (requiring that factual\n\ncontentions have evidentiary support only \"to the best of the\n\nperson's     knowledge,   information,     and   belief,   formed   after    an\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\finquiry    reasonable       under    the    circumstances\").            The    question\n\npresented    by    plaintiff's      counsel's        first   argument     is   whether\n\nsomething more than falsity and serious carelessness is required;\n\ncounsel contend that where the court itself initiates the Rule 11\n\ninquiry, the conduct must involve \"situations that are akin to a\n\ncontempt    of    court.\"      The    phrase        is   taken   from    an    Advisory\n\nCommittee's Note, to which we will return.\n\n            This distinction urged by plaintiff's counsel is at odds\n\nwith the plain language of Rule 11.                 Rule 11(b), creating duties,\n\nsets out the substantive obligations of counsel (e.g., that factual\n\nclaims must have evidentiary support or a likely prospect of it)\n\nwithout in any way suggesting that the substantive obligations\n\ndiffer depending on whether a later claim of violation is raised by\n\nopposing counsel or the court.             Nor is it obvious why anyone would\n\nwish such duties governing “primary conduct” to depend on who might\n\nthereafter       raise   objections        in   a   remedial     proceeding.        Cf.\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico v. SS Zoe Colocotroni, 628 F.2d 652,\n\n669 (1st Cir. 1980).\n\n          Rule 11(c), addressing sanctions, does distinguish between\n\nthe procedures that apply depending on whether opposing counsel or\n\nthe court initiates the charge.                 In the former case, there is a\n\nsafe harbor opportunity to withdraw the objected-to statement\n\nwithin 21 days and thereby avoid sanctions; in the latter there is\n\nnot.   But the object of the safe harbor is to allow a party to\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fprivately withdraw a questionable contention without fear that the\n\nwithdrawal will be viewed by the court as an admission of a Rule 11\n\nviolation.        Advisory Committee's Note to Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b) and\n\n(c).        Nothing in the language of Rule 11(c) says that, if the court\n\ninitiates the inquiry, something more than a Rule 11(b) breach of\n\nduty is required.\n\n                The only hint of such a distinction as to the substantive\n\nstandard appears in the Advisory Committee's Note, which explains\n\nthe absence of a safe harbor for court-initiated inquiries as\n\nfollows: \"Since show cause orders will ordinarily be issued only in\n\nsituations that are akin to a contempt of court, the rule does not\n\nprovide a [comparable] 'safe harbor' [to withdraw the objected to\n\nstatement].\"         This language has, indeed, been taken by several\n\ncircuits as suggesting that only egregious conduct can be reached\n\nwhere the court begins the inquiry,4 but we think mistaken any\n\ninference that this language requires malign subjective intent.\n\n                It is true that courts ought not invoke Rule 11 for\n\nslight cause; the wheels of justice would grind to a halt if\n\nlawyers everywhere were sanctioned every time they made unfounded\n\nobjections, weak arguments, and dubious factual claims.           Obert,\n\n2005 WL 388302, at *7.        However, this is an argument for requiring\n\n\n        4\n      See Kaplan v. DaimlerChrysler, A.G., 331 F.3d 1251, 1255-56\n   th\n(11 Cir. 2003); In re Pennie & Edmunds LLP, 323 F.3d 86, 90-93 (2d\nCir. 2003); Hunter v. Earthgrains Co.

R & D Latex Corp., 242\nF.3d 1102, 1115, 1118 (9th Cir. 2001).\n\n                                     -14-\n\fserious    misconduct,    whoever    initiated      the   inquiry    into   a\n\nviolation–-not for distinguishing between the judge and opposing\n\ncounsel.     The \"akin to contempt\" language used by the Advisory\n\nCommittee's Note may well have meant only that no safe harbor was\n\nneeded because judges would act only in the face of serious\n\nmisconduct.\n\n             A specific purpose of the 1993 revision of Rule 11 was to\n\nreject such a bad faith requirement. See Advisory Committee's Note\n\nsaying that the amendments were “intended to eliminate any 'empty-\n\nhead pure-heart' justification for patently frivolous arguments.”\n\nSince then only one circuit court has read the present rule to\n\nrequire bad faith, In re Pennie & Edmunds LLP, 323 F.3d 86, 90-93\n\n(2d Cir. 2003), and it did so in the teeth of a strong dissent, id.\n\nat 93-102.    True, judges must be especially careful where they are\n\nboth prosecutor and judge; but careful appellate review is the\n\nanswer to     this   concern,   whether    the   charge   is   negligence   or\n\ndeliberate dishonesty and whether it is contempt or a Rule 11\n\nviolation. If anything, opposing counsel has far greater incentive\n\nthan the trial judge to invoke Rule 11 for slight cause.\n\n             We come, then, to the question whether the two objected-\n\nto statements in the memorandum were false and, if so, sufficiently\n\ncareless to warrant sanction. The trial judge read both statements\n\nto suggest that the court had forced plaintiff's counsel to sign\n\nthe stipulation.      In our view, read as a whole, the memorandum\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fmakes it clear that the judge did not require that the stipulation\n\nbe signed but only said that a stipulation was a condition to use\n\nof the diagram in Scheck's opening statement--which is entirely\n\naccurate.     There is some warrant for criticism of the memorandum\n\nbut the central charge of falsity on which the Rule 11 findings\n\nrest cannot be sustained, so the issue of carelessness disappears.\n\n            The   first   paragraph    of    the   memorandum   (block-quoted\n\nabove) did say that plaintiff was informed at the opening that \"she\n\nhad to agree to defendants' stipulation,\" omitting to add the\n\nphrase \"in order to use the diagram in the opening argument.\"                But\n\nthe memorandum soon makes it explicitly clear that the judge\n\nrequired the stipulation only in the sense that it was a condition\n\nof using the diagram in the opening.               Describing the events of\n\nOctober 8 after defense counsel rejected Scheck's stipulation, the\n\nmemorandum states:    \"The Court instructed plaintiff again that the\n\nexhibit could be only used under stipulation.\"\n\n            As for the second quotation objected to by the judge--the\n\nstatement that \"plaintiff had no choice but to sign a stipulation\"\n\n--the memorandum did not assert that the judge had directed Scheck\n\nto sign; indeed, the statement followed immediately after the\n\nmemorandum’s statement that defendants had rejected the Scheck\n\nstipulation    \"minutes    before     the    opening\"   (in   which,    as   the\n\nmemorandum had already explained, the diagram was crucial to\n\nScheck's    planned   presentation).           “Forced”   refers   to    these\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fcircumstances and not to any directive from the judge that Scheck\n\nsign the stipulation.\n\n          The main problem in this memorandum is that in the\n\nintroductory summary the drafter took as an unexplained premise\n\nwhat the lawyers and the judge full well knew:       that the judge had\n\nmade clear,   before   the   fatal   stipulation   was   signed,   that   a\n\ndisputed document could not be used in the opening argument absent\n\na stipulation.   Yet, as we have just seen, even this premise is\n\nmade explicit later in the memorandum.       The general rule is that\n\nstatements must be taken in context, United States v. Moran, 393\n\nF.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir. 2004), and that related parts of a document\n\nmust be taken together, Nadherny v. Roseland Property Co., 390 F.3d\n\n44, 49 (1st Cir. 2004).      That a hasty reader might take the first\n\nparagraph out of context is not in the present circumstances enough\n\nto brand the memorandum as false.\n\n          We are not suggesting that a deliberate lie would be\n\nimmune to sanction merely because corrective language can be found\n\nburied somewhere else in the document.       But here the trial judge\n\ndid not find, and in these circumstances could not have found, that\n\ndefense counsel had intended to deceive.           The memorandum was\n\ndrafted under pressure, by a younger lawyer not admitted as counsel\n\nin the case; and it was reviewed and signed by Mann, whose\n\nestablished reputation and integrity the opinion praises, and by\n\nBrustin, whose trial conduct is also approved of by the judge in\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fher decision.      Nor, of course, can anyone suppose that the judge\n\nwould have been misled as to what she herself had earlier directed.\n\n                As it happens, the memorandum may otherwise have been\n\nmisleading or inaccurate in certain of its detail.             If one accepts\n\nthe account of defense counsel at the show cause hearing, the\n\nmemorandum left out both the fact of prior warnings from defense\n\ncounsel that they were concerned about the diagram and the fact\n\nthat the photographs themselves were furnished to Brustin on\n\nSeptember 25 or 26.         By omitting such detail, the memorandum\n\nenhances the “surprise” element tincturing the memorandum’s gloss\n\non the events of October 7 and 8 (\"for the first time,\" \"last\n\nminute choice\").        Further, assuming that the photographs were\n\nprovided on September 25 or 26, the memorandum’s statement that the\n\nstipulation      was   signed   \"without   any   chance    to    review    the\n\nphotographs at issue\" is doubtful; perhaps Scheck meant only that\n\nhe had not focused on the issue but it would have been better to\n\nsay that.\n\n            However, the district court made no definitive findings\n\nas to what warnings were given and when.         The basis for the Rule 11\n\ncharges   was    the   suggestion   that   the   judge   had    required   the\n\nstipulation.     We also do not know how far defense counsel had gone,\n\nprior to receiving the out-takes, in leading plaintiff's counsel to\n\nbelieve that the diagram was common ground.           Nor can we tell how\n\nfar Scheck was involved in trial preparations before his last-\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fminute pro hac vice appearance.             The final period before a large\n\ntrial, like the trial itself, involves late nights, multiplying\n\ntasks and resulting confusions that are hard to imagine for one who\n\nhas not experienced them.               The burden upon the trial judge is\n\nscarcely less.\n\n              The district judge is well known for both patience and\n\ncare.     It is easy to imagine why, in the course of a tense and\n\ncontentious trial, she was greatly displeased at a document,\n\nemblazoned with references to injustice, that could be publicly\n\nread    as   blaming      the   trial   judge     for   what    had   patently   been\n\nplaintiff's counsel's own miscalculation.                 But on a close reading\n\nand a consideration of all the circumstances, the memorandum taken\n\nas a whole did no more than say, albeit inartfully, that the trial\n\njudge had required the stipulation to be signed as a condition of\n\nusing the diagram in the opening.\n\n              Accordingly,        the   findings    that       plaintiff's   counsel\n\nviolated Rule 11 cannot stand; and, as those findings are the only\n\ngrounds for the censure, admonition and revocation of pro hac vice\n\nstatus,      they   too    must   be    undone.     The    findings     of   Rule   11\n\nviolations are set aside, the sanction and admonition are vacated,\n\nand the pro hac vice status of Scheck and Brustin is restored.                      No\n\ncosts.\n\n              It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\f",

In the course of a civil rights\n\naction, the district court determined that three attorneys for the\n\nplaintiff had violated Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure.      The court revoked the pro hac vice status of the two\n\nattorneys who were not members of the court's bar and formally\n\ncensured one of the two.      Young v. City of Providence, 301 F. Supp.\n\n2d 187 (D.R.I. 2004).      In this decision, we address appeals by all\n\nthree attorneys; the merits of the civil rights action are the\n\nsubject   of    the   plaintiff’s    separate      appeal    resolved     in    our\n\ncompanion      decision   issued    today    sub   nom.     Young   v.   City   of\n\nProvidence.\n\n             The civil rights action grew out of a tragedy that\n\noccurred in January 2000 in Providence, Rhode Island.                Two police\n\nofficers (Michael Solitro and Carlos Saraiva), responding to the\n\nscene of a nighttime disturbance at a restaurant, shot and killed\n\nan off-duty officer-–Cornel Young, Jr., who, with his weapon drawn,\n\nwas attempting to assist them.              In June 2001, Young’s mother,\n\nacting on her own behalf and as executor of Young's estate, brought\n\na civil rights action in district court asserting claims under\n\nsection 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000), and under state law, against\n\nthe city, various officials and the two officers.\n\n             The case, assigned to Judge Mary Lisi, was a complex one.\n\nThis was due in part to the difficulty in reconstructing exactly\n\nwhat had happened in the nighttime encounter, in part to the\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fdifferent tiers of liability asserted against various defendants\n\n(direct, supervisory and municipal) and in part to plaintiff's aim\n\nto show a pattern or policy of incompetent hiring and inadequate\n\ntraining.    Both Barry Scheck and Nicholas Brustin of the New York\n\nfirm of Cochran, Neufeld & Scheck LLP were admitted pro hac vice to\n\nrepresent the plaintiff; Robert Mann of the Providence firm of Mann\n\n& Mitchell acted as local counsel. Scheck was admitted, to replace\n\nhis partner Johnnie Cochran, Jr., only in September 2003--shortly\n\nbefore a “phase I” trial was to begin focusing on the conduct of\n\nSolitro and Saraiva.\n\n            The litigation was the subject of extensive publicity;\n\namong other facets, the officers who fired the shots were white\n\nwhile Cornel Young was black (and the son of a senior Providence\n\npolice officer).         Scheck, who acted as lead counsel after his\n\nadmission,    was   at   odds   with    the   district    judge   over   various\n\nmatters, including the division of the trial into two phases.                Yet\n\nthe incident that gave rise to the Rule 11 findings, censure and\n\nrevocation of pro hac vice status was narrowly focused and arose\n\nagainst the following background.\n\n             By   September     2003,     extensive      discovery   had    been\n\nconducted.    One of the issues in the discovery, and in the ensuing\n\ntrial, concerned the precise movements of Cornel Young and of\n\nSolitro.     The former had been inside the restaurant; Solitro and\n\nSaraiva had approached the building through the parking lot to find\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fa man (later identified as Aldrin Diaz, who had caused an earlier\n\ndisturbance) pointing a gun out of the window of a Chevrolet Camaro\n\nparked in the lot in front of the restaurant.       Solitro broke cover\n\nand started toward the car.     Young, moving to assist, emerged from\n\nthe restaurant with his own weapon drawn and was shot by Solitro\n\nand Saraiva.     Just where Young and Solitro had stood and moved had\n\na bearing on who was at fault in the episode.\n\n           During discovery, Solitro had drawn a line indicating his\n\nown movement in relation to other physical landmarks including the\n\nCamaro; the line was drawn on a clear overlay laid atop a made-to-\n\nscale diagram prepared by the state attorney general in his own\n\ninvestigation.     Scheck planned to rely importantly on the diagram\n\nin his opening to explain to the jury the defense version of what\n\nhad happened.     However, in September 2003, out-takes filmed by a\n\nlocal TV station on the night of the shooting became available and,\n\nfrom   defense   counsel's   viewpoint,   raised   questions   about   the\n\naccuracy of the diagram–-at least as to the location of the Camaro.\n\nUntil then it had apparently been expected that both sides would\n\nagree to the admission of the diagram.\n\n           At the final pre-trial conference on September 19, 2003,\n\nthe district court was told briefly that there was a dispute about\n\nthe diagram.     Defense counsel later recalled advising Brustin on\n\nSeptember 25 or 26 of the specific discrepancy but Scheck later\n\nsaid that he did not fully understand the problem until October 7,\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f2003, when the jury was being selected.    Defense counsel then told\n\nthe district judge that the defense objected to the diagram as\n\ninconsistent with photographs made from the out-takes, and the\n\njudge responded that the parties should confer to see whether they\n\ncould stipulate as to the matter.      The judge told plaintiff's\n\ncounsel: \"If you can't agree to a stipulation on that, then I'm\n\ngoing to have to tell you to stay away from it because you're going\n\nto need testimony to explain it to the jury.\"\n\n          Scheck then offered as a compromise to stipulate that the\n\ndiagram conflicted with photographs made from the film out-takes,\n\nbut the next morning defense counsel declined the offer.     Scheck\n\nagain sought unsuccessfully to persuade the judge that he ought to\n\nbe allowed to refer to the diagram in the opening.    Then, with the\n\nopening statements about to begin, Scheck signed a stipulation\n\ndrafted by defense counsel that the diagram was inaccurate as to\n\nthe location of the Camaro and that the actual alignment of the car\n\nwas as described in the stipulation.      On this basis, Scheck was\n\nallowed to use the diagram in the opening, but he was not allowed\n\nthereafter to elicit testimony contradicting the stipulation.\n\n          Over the next several days of trial, further examination\n\nof the photographs persuaded Scheck and his colleagues that the\n\nout-takes did not contradict the diagram.      A young associate at\n\nScheck's firm was told to draft a memorandum to support a motion\n\nseeking relief from the stipulation on grounds of mistake.       The\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fmemorandum was filed with the court on October 16, 2003 in mid-\n\ntrial, after being reviewed and then signed by all three counsel–-\n\nScheck, Brustin and Mann.1   That same morning the judge directed\n\ncounsel to re-read the memorandum, saying that she was disturbed by\n\nrepresentations made in the memorandum, \"particularly as they\n\nrelate to the actions of the court.\"\n\n          The memorandum, set forth in full at 301 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n199-204, started with an introductory paragraph that conflated the\n\nearlier events by saying that counsel had believed prior to trial\n\nthat the diagram could be used at trial and then continued:\n\n          It was only on the eve of opening statements,\n          once plaintiff had prepared her entire opening\n          based on that stipulation, that defendants\n          first said they would not stipulate to Exhibit\n          18, based on two new photographs they had\n          found, Exhibits X and Y. Plaintiff, moments\n          before her opening, was informed by the Court\n          she had to agree to defendants’ stipulation.\n          Plaintiff was genuinely confused about the\n          import of photographs X and Y.     Plaintiff's\n          opening relied critically on using that\n          exhibit to explain events to the jury.      In\n          this state of confusion and uncertainty,\n          plaintiff felt little choice but to accept any\n          stipulation defendant provided.\n\nId. at 200.\n\n          Thereafter, the memorandum provided a much more detailed\n\nrecitation of events, together with legal arguments to justify\n\nrelief from the stipulation entered into in such circumstances.\n\n\n     1\n      A further version, correcting typographical errors, was filed\nlater that day. The differences between the two versions are not\nmaterial to these appeals.\n\n                               -7-\n\fLater, the memorandum blamed defense counsel for rejecting Scheck's\n\nOctober   7     compromise    stipulation,          adding    that   \"[u]nder   the\n\ncircumstances, plaintiff had no choice but to sign a stipulation\n\nwithout any chance to review the photographs at issue.”                     Id. at\n\n208. It there quoted a well known treatise that \"'courts will look\n\nat the facts carefully to see that one litigant has not been\n\ncoerced into the stipulation.'\"           Id. at 208 n.5 (quoting 22 Wright\n\n& Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure § 5194 (1978)).\n\n             After filing the motion and then hearing the judge's\n\nstatement      that   she    was     disturbed       by     its   representations,\n\nplaintiff's counsel returned to their office after the trial ended\n\nfor the day and, assertedly unable to determine what had so\n\ntroubled the judge, prepared a letter of general apology, which was\n\nimmediately delivered to court. It apologized for any misstatement\n\nand said that \"we do not seek to shift responsibility to the Court\n\n[for   the     stipulation],       and   if    we    have    created   a   contrary\n\nimpression, we are sorry.\"               It did not withdraw any specific\n\nstatement; plaintiff's counsel's position is that at that time they\n\ndid not fully appreciate what had so concerned the district judge.\n\n              The following morning, during argument on the motion for\n\nrelief from the stipulation, the judge made clear her view that\n\n\"the reference [in the memorandum] to the Court instructing you\n\nthat you had to stipulate is, again, a misrepresentation.\"                   Scheck\n\nnow sought to explain that he had been misunderstood, but the judge\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fdenied the motion for relief from the stipulation.     Later that day\n\nthe court called counsel before it and ruled that, based on the\n\nmemorandum's misrepresentation, the pro hac vice admissions of\n\nScheck and Brustin were revoked.      Mann was directed to proceed to\n\nrepresent plaintiff at the trial.        The trial proceeded to its\n\ncompletion and to a final judgment on February 12, 2004.\n\n           After the trial but before final judgment was entered,\n\nthe district court on November 7, 2003, issued a show cause order\n\nto the three plaintiff's counsel.      The order said that all three\n\ncounsel had violated Rule 11(b)(3)2 and directed the parties to\n\nshow cause why sanctions should not be imposed.      Counsel filed a\n\nmemorandum and affidavits arguing that they had had no deceptive\n\nintent and that, read as a whole and in context, their memorandum\n\nasking to withdraw the stipulation had not misrepresented any\n\nfacts.    The Rhode Island Bar Association filed an amicus brief in\n\nsupport of the lawyers; the ACLU also sought unsuccessfully to do\n\nso.\n\n           On December 15, 2003, the district court held hearings on\n\nthe show cause order, first agreeing to modify the show cause order\n\nto say only that it \"appears\" that plaintiff's counsel had violated\n\n\n\n      2\n      This provision requires that in every pleading, or motion or\nother filing counsel's signature is a representation that \"the\nallegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support\nor, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary\nsupport after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or\ndiscovery.”\n\n                                -9-\n\fRule 11.   On February 11, 2004, the court issued an order finding\n\nthat all three counsel had violated Rule 11.             In describing the\n\nbackground,    the   February   11   order   pointed     out   that   defense\n\ncounsel's version of events suggested that plaintiff's counsel had\n\nenjoyed more detailed and specific warnings that the defense\n\ndisputed the accuracy of the diagram than had previously been\n\nadvertised.    However, the judge did not resolve any disputes on\n\nthis score or rely upon such omissions in finding the Rule 11\n\nviolations.\n\n           Rather, the Rule 11 findings focused solely upon two\n\nspecific \"misrepresentations\" in the memorandum: one was the above\n\nblock-quoted     language   including        the   key     statement     that\n\n\"[p]laintiff, moments before her opening, was informed by the Court\n\nshe had to agree to defendants' stipulation.\"            301 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n200.   The other was the statement that defense counsel \"had no\n\nchoice\" but to sign the stipulation without any chance to review\n\nthe photographs.     Id. at 208.      Both statements, said the court,\n\nfalsely indicated that the court had ordered the stipulation to be\n\nsigned; and, the court noted, the memorandum's references to\n\ninjustice and coercion gave the impression that the court was\n\nresponsible for such wrongs.\n\n           The court accepted that the memorandum had been drafted\n\nby a young associate and that plaintiff's counsel had denied\n\ninstructing the younger lawyer to say that the court had directed\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fthe stipulation.         However, the court said that plaintiff's counsel\n\nwere responsible under Rule 11 for statements made in a memorandum\n\nthat       they   had        reviewed   and    signed.      Assessing    relative\n\nresponsibility, the court sanctioned Scheck by imposing \"a public\n\ncensure,\" 301 F. Supp. 2d at 198; Brustin, an associate whom the\n\ncourt said took direction from Scheck, was merely \"admonished\" to\n\nbe more careful, id.; and as to Mann, whose role was ascribed to\n\n\"inattention,\" id. at 199, the court said that his reputation in\n\nRhode Island for integrity was well established and a sanction was\n\nunnecessary to deter repetition.\n\n              All three of plaintiff's counsel have appealed from the\n\norder determining that they committed Rule 11 violations, and\n\nScheck and Brustin have asked that their censure and admonition be\n\noverturned and their pro hac vice status restored.                  In our view,\n\nthe Rule 11 findings are appealable, being distinguishable from\n\nmere criticism, and, so too, the censure and admonition.3                  Nor is\n\nthe request for reinstatement of pro hac vice status moot since the\n\nmerits      appeal      in    the   civil     rights   action   keeps   alive   the\n\npossibility of further district court proceedings.

In this case, defense\n\ncounsel make two principal arguments as to the Rule 11 findings:\n\none relates to the substantive legal standard to be applied under\n\nRule 11 where the court initiates the inquiry into a possible\n\nviolation; the other is whether, under the proper standard, the\n\nobjected-to statements violated Rule 11. We consider the issues in\n\nthis order.\n\n             Rule 11(b) is not a strict liability provision. It\n\nprohibits filings made with \"any improper purpose,\" the offering of\n\n\"frivolous\" arguments, and the assertion of factual allegations\n\nwithout \"evidentiary support\" or the \"likely\" prospect of such\n\nsupport.     A lawyer who makes an inaccurate factual representation\n\nmust,   at   the   very   least,   be   culpably   careless   to    commit   a\n\nviolation.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b) (requiring that factual\n\ncontentions have evidentiary support only \"to the best of the\n\nperson's     knowledge,   information,     and   belief,   formed   after    an\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\finquiry    reasonable       under    the    circumstances\").            The    question\n\npresented    by    plaintiff's      counsel's        first   argument     is   whether\n\nsomething more than falsity and serious carelessness is required;\n\ncounsel contend that where the court itself initiates the Rule 11\n\ninquiry, the conduct must involve \"situations that are akin to a\n\ncontempt    of    court.\"      The    phrase        is   taken   from    an    Advisory\n\nCommittee's Note, to which we will return.\n\n            This distinction urged by plaintiff's counsel is at odds\n\nwith the plain language of Rule 11.                 Rule 11(b), creating duties,\n\nsets out the substantive obligations of counsel (e.g., that factual\n\nclaims must have evidentiary support or a likely prospect of it)\n\nwithout in any way suggesting that the substantive obligations\n\ndiffer depending on whether a later claim of violation is raised by\n\nopposing counsel or the court.             Nor is it obvious why anyone would\n\nwish such duties governing “primary conduct” to depend on who might\n\nthereafter       raise   objections        in   a   remedial     proceeding.        Cf.\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico v. SS Zoe Colocotroni, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"381350\"><a href=\"/opinion/381350/commonwealth-of-puerto-rico-v-the-ss-zoe-colocotroni-her-engines/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n669 (1st Cir. 1980).\n\n          Rule 11(c), addressing sanctions, does distinguish between\n\nthe procedures that apply depending on whether opposing counsel or\n\nthe court initiates the charge.                 In the former case, there is a\n\nsafe harbor opportunity to withdraw the objected-to statement\n\nwithin 21 days and thereby avoid sanctions; in the latter there is\n\nnot.   But the object of the safe harbor is to allow a party to\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fprivately withdraw a questionable contention without fear that the\n\nwithdrawal will be viewed by the court as an admission of a Rule 11\n\nviolation.        Advisory Committee's Note to Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b) and\n\n(c).        Nothing in the language of Rule 11(c) says that, if the court\n\ninitiates the inquiry, something more than a Rule 11(b) breach of\n\nduty is required.\n\n                The only hint of such a distinction as to the substantive\n\nstandard appears in the Advisory Committee's Note, which explains\n\nthe absence of a safe harbor for court-initiated inquiries as\n\nfollows: \"Since show cause orders will ordinarily be issued only in\n\nsituations that are akin to a contempt of court, the rule does not\n\nprovide a [comparable] 'safe harbor' [to withdraw the objected to\n\nstatement].\"         This language has, indeed, been taken by several\n\ncircuits as suggesting that only egregious conduct can be reached\n\nwhere the court begins the inquiry,4 but we think mistaken any\n\ninference that this language requires malign subjective intent.\n\n                It is true that courts ought not invoke Rule 11 for\n\nslight cause; the wheels of justice would grind to a halt if\n\nlawyers everywhere were sanctioned every time they made unfounded\n\nobjections, weak arguments, and dubious factual claims.

The \"akin to contempt\" language used by the Advisory\n\nCommittee's Note may well have meant only that no safe harbor was\n\nneeded because judges would act only in the face of serious\n\nmisconduct.\n\n             A specific purpose of the 1993 revision of Rule 11 was to\n\nreject such a bad faith requirement. See Advisory Committee's Note\n\nsaying that the amendments were “intended to eliminate any 'empty-\n\nhead pure-heart' justification for patently frivolous arguments.”\n\nSince then only one circuit court has read the present rule to\n\nrequire bad faith, In re Pennie & Edmunds LLP, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781271\"><a href=\"/opinion/781271/in-re-pennie-edmonds-llp/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 90-93\n\n(2d Cir. 2003), and it did so in the teeth of a strong dissent, id.\n\nat 93-102.    True, judges must be especially careful where they are\n\nboth prosecutor and judge; but careful appellate review is the\n\nanswer to     this   concern,   whether    the   charge   is   negligence   or\n\ndeliberate dishonesty and whether it is contempt or a Rule 11\n\nviolation. If anything, opposing counsel has far greater incentive\n\nthan the trial judge to invoke Rule 11 for slight cause.\n\n             We come, then, to the question whether the two objected-\n\nto statements in the memorandum were false and, if so, sufficiently\n\ncareless to warrant sanction. The trial judge read both statements\n\nto suggest that the court had forced plaintiff's counsel to sign\n\nthe stipulation.      In our view, read as a whole, the memorandum\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fmakes it clear that the judge did not require that the stipulation\n\nbe signed but only said that a stipulation was a condition to use\n\nof the diagram in Scheck's opening statement--which is entirely\n\naccurate.     There is some warrant for criticism of the memorandum\n\nbut the central charge of falsity on which the Rule 11 findings\n\nrest cannot be sustained, so the issue of carelessness disappears.\n\n            The   first   paragraph    of    the   memorandum   (block-quoted\n\nabove) did say that plaintiff was informed at the opening that \"she\n\nhad to agree to defendants' stipulation,\" omitting to add the\n\nphrase \"in order to use the diagram in the opening argument.\"                But\n\nthe memorandum soon makes it explicitly clear that the judge\n\nrequired the stipulation only in the sense that it was a condition\n\nof using the diagram in the opening.               Describing the events of\n\nOctober 8 after defense counsel rejected Scheck's stipulation, the\n\nmemorandum states:    \"The Court instructed plaintiff again that the\n\nexhibit could be only used under stipulation.\"\n\n            As for the second quotation objected to by the judge--the\n\nstatement that \"plaintiff had no choice but to sign a stipulation\"\n\n--the memorandum did not assert that the judge had directed Scheck\n\nto sign; indeed, the statement followed immediately after the\n\nmemorandum’s statement that defendants had rejected the Scheck\n\nstipulation    \"minutes    before     the    opening\"   (in   which,    as   the\n\nmemorandum had already explained, the diagram was crucial to\n\nScheck's    planned   presentation).           “Forced”   refers   to    these\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fcircumstances and not to any directive from the judge that Scheck\n\nsign the stipulation.\n\n          The main problem in this memorandum is that in the\n\nintroductory summary the drafter took as an unexplained premise\n\nwhat the lawyers and the judge full well knew:       that the judge had\n\nmade clear,   before   the   fatal   stipulation   was   signed,   that   a\n\ndisputed document could not be used in the opening argument absent\n\na stipulation.   Yet, as we have just seen, even this premise is\n\nmade explicit later in the memorandum.       The general rule is that\n\nstatements must be taken in context, United States v. Moran, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201379\"><a href=\"/opinion/201379/united-states-v-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16 (1st Cir. 2004), and that related parts of a document\n\nmust be taken together, Nadherny v. Roseland Property Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201349\"><a href=\"/opinion/201349/nadherny-v-roseland-property-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 49 (1st Cir. 2004).      That a hasty reader might take the first\n\nparagraph out of context is not in the present circumstances enough\n\nto brand the memorandum as false.\n\n          We are not suggesting that a deliberate lie would be\n\nimmune to sanction merely because corrective language can be found\n\nburied somewhere else in the document.       But here the trial judge\n\ndid not find, and in these circumstances could not have found, that\n\ndefense counsel had intended to deceive.           The memorandum was\n\ndrafted under pressure, by a younger lawyer not admitted as counsel\n\nin the case; and it was reviewed and signed by Mann, whose\n\nestablished reputation and integrity the opinion praises, and by\n\nBrustin, whose trial conduct is also approved of by the judge in\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fher decision.      Nor, of course, can anyone suppose that the judge\n\nwould have been misled as to what she herself had earlier directed.\n\n                As it happens, the memorandum may otherwise have been\n\nmisleading or inaccurate in certain of its detail.             If one accepts\n\nthe account of defense counsel at the show cause hearing, the\n\nmemorandum left out both the fact of prior warnings from defense\n\ncounsel that they were concerned about the diagram and the fact\n\nthat the photographs themselves were furnished to Brustin on\n\nSeptember 25 or 26.         By omitting such detail, the memorandum\n\nenhances the “surprise” element tincturing the memorandum’s gloss\n\non the events of October 7 and 8 (\"for the first time,\" \"last\n\nminute choice\").        Further, assuming that the photographs were\n\nprovided on September 25 or 26, the memorandum’s statement that the\n\nstipulation      was   signed   \"without   any   chance    to    review    the\n\nphotographs at issue\" is doubtful; perhaps Scheck meant only that\n\nhe had not focused on the issue but it would have been better to\n\nsay that.\n\n            However, the district court made no definitive findings\n\nas to what warnings were given and when.         The basis for the Rule 11\n\ncharges   was    the   suggestion   that   the   judge   had    required   the\n\nstipulation.     We also do not know how far defense counsel had gone,\n\nprior to receiving the out-takes, in leading plaintiff's counsel to\n\nbelieve that the diagram was common ground.           Nor can we tell how\n\nfar Scheck was involved in trial preparations before his last-\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fminute pro hac vice appearance.             The final period before a large\n\ntrial, like the trial itself, involves late nights, multiplying\n\ntasks and resulting confusions that are hard to imagine for one who\n\nhas not experienced them.               The burden upon the trial judge is\n\nscarcely less.\n\n              The district judge is well known for both patience and\n\ncare.     It is easy to imagine why, in the course of a tense and\n\ncontentious trial, she was greatly displeased at a document,\n\nemblazoned with references to injustice, that could be publicly\n\nread    as   blaming      the   trial   judge     for   what    had   patently   been\n\nplaintiff's counsel's own miscalculation.                 But on a close reading\n\nand a consideration of all the circumstances, the memorandum taken\n\nas a whole did no more than say, albeit inartfully, that the trial\n\njudge had required the stipulation to be signed as a condition of\n\nusing the diagram in the opening.\n\n              Accordingly,        the   findings    that       plaintiff's   counsel\n\nviolated Rule 11 cannot stand; and, as those findings are the only\n\ngrounds for the censure, admonition and revocation of pro hac vice\n\nstatus,      they   too    must   be    undone.     The    findings     of   Rule   11\n\nviolations are set aside, the sanction and admonition are vacated,\n\nand the pro hac vice status of Scheck and Brustin is restored.                      No\n\ncosts.\n\n              It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\f</pre>",
