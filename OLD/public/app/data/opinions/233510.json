The sole ground stated in the motion for attacking the validity of the judgment is the allegation that 'the evidence on which the conviction rests was illicit', in that it was procured in the course of an unconstitutional search and seizure.

If one is guilty, there is nothing wrong in pleading guilty- nor is there error by the court in accepting such a plea and sentencing the accused thereon- even though it might be true that the government would have been unable to establish the accused's guilt had he pleaded not guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
