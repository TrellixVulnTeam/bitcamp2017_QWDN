Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                and Carter,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n     Randy Olen, on brief, for appellant.\n     Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nH.S. García, United States Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-Sosa,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          March 17, 2005\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation.\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.        Defendant-appellant Víctor\n\nRodríguez León (\"Rodríguez\") entered into a plea agreement on one\n\ncount of aiding and abetting in the possession with intent to\n\ndistribute and/or distribution of multiple kilograms of controlled\n\nsubstances, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a), for his involvement\n\nbetween the ages of nine and seventeen1 in a drug organization in\n\nwhich both of his parents were also involved.        He alleges that his\n\ncompetence to plead guilty was questionable and that a magistrate\n\njudge erroneously recommended that he be transferred to adult\n\nstatus.   Consequently, he argues, the district court erred in\n\nrefusing to continue sentencing proceedings in order to investigate\n\nhis apparent dissatisfaction with his guilty plea. Because we find\n\nno abuse of discretion in the district court's acceptance of the\n\nguilty plea, failure to permit its withdrawal, or refusal to\n\ncontinue sentencing, the decision below is affirmed.\n\n                            I.   Background\n\n          On   September   19,   2001,   Rodríguez   was   charged   as   a\n\njuvenile in a sealed criminal complaint for conspiracy to possess\n\nwith intent to distribute narcotics, in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n\n\n1\n   Rodríguez was born on September 14, 1983, but the government's\nbrief indicates that he was seventeen and a half years old when he\nwas charged on September 19, 2001 and appellant's brief indicates\nthat he was nineteen years old at the time of his transfer hearing\non May 3, 2002. Regardless of these discrepancies, there appears\nto be agreement that Rodríguez's active participation in the drug\norganization occurred when he was between the ages of nine and\nseventeen.\n\n                                  -2-\n\f§ 846.   On September 21, 2001, Rodríguez plead not guilty to the\n\ncharge and was placed in pretrial detention.   On December 4, 2001,\n\nthe government filed a Motion to Transfer to Adult Status, and\n\namended the charge to aiding and abetting in the possession with\n\nintent to distribute and/or distribution of multiple kilograms of\n\ncontrolled substances, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a).\n\n          An evidentiary hearing was held before Magistrate Judge\n\nAida M. Delgado Colón on May 3, 2001.    At the hearing, Dr. Luis\n\nFrancisco Umpierre, a clinical psychologist, and Dr. Maria T.\n\nMargarida Juliá, a clinical neuropsychologist, testified on behalf\n\nof the Government and Rodríguez, respectively.        Dr. Umpierre\n\ndetermined that Rodríguez has an IQ of 62, corresponding to mild\n\nmental retardation, and both experts found evidence of cognitive\n\ndysfunction or brain damage.    On June 13, 2002, the magistrate\n\njudge issued a detailed Report and Recommendation.   In the Report,\n\nshe made specific findings on each of the six factors that 18\n\nU.S.C. § 5032 directs judicial officers to consider in deciding on\n\ntransfer to adult status.2     She found that Rodríguez's prior\n\n\n\n\n2\n   The factors are \"[1] the age and social background of the\njuvenile; [2] the nature of the alleged offense; [3] the extent and\nnature of the juvenile's prior delinquency record; [4] the\njuvenile's present intellectual development and psychological\nmaturity; [5] the nature of past treatment efforts and the\njuvenile's response to such efforts; [and 6] the availability of\nprograms designed to treat the juvenile's behavioral problems.\" 18\nU.S.C. 5032. The guiding principle in weighing these factors is\nwhether \"transfer would be in the interest of justice.\" Id.\n\n                               -3-\n\fdelinquency record,3 poor response to probationary supervision and\n\ncorresponding need for an institutional rehabilitation program, and\n\nmental limitations on judgment and emotional control, in addition\n\nto the lack of evidence of the existence of adequate non-penal\n\nrehabilitation programs to suit Rodríguez's needs, all weighed in\n\nfavor of transfer to adult status.         In addition, the magistrate\n\njudge found that the nature of the alleged offense -- including\n\nreliable   government   evidence   of    Rodríguez's   participation   in\n\nmurders and \"hunting\" rival drug gang members -- was sufficient,\n\nstanding alone, to warrant transfer to adult status.\n\n           The magistrate judge also made findings as to Rodríguez's\n\ncompetency to stand trial.     She determined, on the basis of the\n\npsychological reports, that although his mental and judgmental\n\ncapacities were limited, Rodríguez was capable of distinguishing\n\nright from wrong, understanding if one penalty was harsher than\n\nanother, understanding the implications of an alibi defense and\n\nassisting his counsel by providing facts and information in support\n\n\n\n3\n   Between December 2000 and February 2001, Rodríguez was found\nguilty of possession of cocaine and six counts of possession of a\nfirearm; arrested on charges of attempted murder, first degree\nmurder, conspiracy to commit murder, and additional weapons\nviolations; and charged with four counts of illegal appropriation\nof a vehicle. He was charged as an adult in the District of Puerto\nRico in these cases.     Additionally, Rodríguez was charged in\ncommonwealth court with possession of drug paraphernalia and 135\nbags of cocaine intended for distribution.            Commonwealth\nproceedings to transfer Rodríguez to adult status on these charges\nwere underway at the time the magistrate judge rendered her Report\nand Recommendation.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fthereof.   Thus, she concluded, he was competent to stand trial and\n\nassist defense counsel.\n\n           Rodríguez initially filed a sealed objection to the\n\nReport   and   Recommendation,   but    just   over   a   month   later,   he\n\nsubmitted a motion to proceed against him as an adult.            The motion\n\nstates that \"upon advise [sic] of counsel, [Rodríguez] voluntarily\n\nwaives all further transfer procedures in this case [and] requests\n\nto be proceeded against as an adult for purposes of criminal\n\nprosecution in this case.\"   The same day, he waived indictment and\n\nplead guilty to one count of distribution of various narcotic\n\ndrugs, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a).\n\n           At the change of plea hearing before district court judge\n\nJuan M. Pérez Giménez, Rodríguez's counsel orally withdrew his\n\nopposition to the Report and Recommendation.              After questioning\n\nRodríguez directly, the district judge accepted the Report and\n\nRecommendation and waiver of transfer proceedings, found Rodríguez\n\ncompetent to waive indictment, and accepted his guilty plea.\n\n           A sentencing hearing was held on November 22, 2002.             At\n\nthe hearing, the following exchange occurred between the district\n\njudge and Rodríguez's counsel:\n\n     MR. ANGLADA: Your Honor, let me put something on the\n     record before we start. I am ready for sentence and we\n     have reviewed the PSI with the client. The client would\n     like the sentence to be continued. One of the reasons is\n     that his mother was already sentenced and his father is\n     to be sentenced at an adjacent court on December 10th.\n     We are within the thirty-five days. I am ready but I\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fhave the duty and the loyalty to my client to inform the\ncourt that he would prefer sentencing to be continued.\n\nTHE COURT: What is the reason?\n\nMR. ANGLADA: The reason, Your Honor, is that he would\nprefer sentence not to be imposed in accordance with the\nwritten plea agreement. His father is to be sentenced by\nthe Honorable Court if the plea is accepted by that\nneighboring court for a prison term of eighteen and a\nhalf years and, of course, I am bound by the plea\nagreement before this court and this plea calls for the\nimposition of a sentence of thirty seven points with a\ncriminal history of two for the imposition of a sentence\nof 240 months. So, I am ready, he would -\n\nTHE COURT: But the fact that his father may be sentenced\nbefore or after he is sentenced, how does that affect his\nown sentence?\n\nMR. ANGLADA: Your Honor, in my opinion I don't see any\nreasoning other than the generic attitude of his father\nnow that our plea agreement is not a satisfactory plea\nagreement for his father and, therefore, for him,\nremember that he is now 18 or 19 and his IQ is one of 62.\nNow he is with his father at MDC and now he is again\nunder the influence of his father.\n\n....\n\nTHE COURT: Again my question is, do you think it would be\nbeneficial for him to continue now under his father's\nsupervision or if I sentence him today ask the Marshals\nto transport him out of Puerto Rico, so he is not under\nthat influence, which apparently is a very bad influence.\n\nMR. ANGLADA: Well, Your Honor, as an attorney, as a\nfather, I have an opinion.     I don't want to further\njeopardize my relationship to him, so, you know, I don't\nknow, if you are going to accept my words as an answer.\n\n....\n\nTHE COURT: . . . . [W]e will proceed to sentence the\ndefendant today. I think that your actions in this case\nwere professionally carried out. You obtained the best\nplea agreement you could with the government under the\ncircumstances and I would rather have him be sentenced\n\n                          -6-\n\f     today than leave the door open that might create problems\n     between yourself and your client, which apparently they\n     have been a very fruitful relationship.\n\nSentencing Transcript at 3-6 (emphasis supplied). Without directly\n\nasking Rodríguez to clarify his reasons for wanting a continuance,\n\nJudge Pérez Giménez sentenced him to 235 months in prison, eight\n\nyears supervised release, and a $100 assessment.\n\n            Rodríguez appealed, claiming that his counsel's remarks\n\nat sentencing put the court on notice that he was challenging the\n\nplea agreement and sought to withdraw his plea.                        Accordingly,\n\nRodríguez   argues     that    the    court   erred    in   failing     to   further\n\ninvestigate whether he was entitled to a change of plea, and in\n\ndenying the requested continuance.\n\n                                II.     Analysis\n\n            A.     Change of plea\n\n            For     purposes     of     our    analysis,      we   will      assume\n\narguendo    that    counsel's    statements      amounted     to   a    request   to\n\nwithdraw Rodríguez's guilty plea.4            The district court's failure to\n\npermit withdrawal, or to inquire further into the basis for the\n\nrequest are therefore reviewed for abuse of discretion. See United\n\nStates v. Isom, 85 F.3d 831, 834 (1996).              A defendant does not have\n\n\n4\n    Were we to hold otherwise, the district court's failure to\npermit a change of plea would be reviewed under the more stringent\nplain error standard. See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725,\n732 (1993); cf. United States v. Browne, 318 F.3d 261, 264-65 (1st\nCir. 2003) (noting that ambiguous request for evidentiary hearing\non change of plea motion would be reviewed for plain error if court\ndid not assume request had been made).\n\n                                        -7-\n\fan absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea, but rather must show\n\na \"fair and just reason\" therefor.           Fed. R. Crim. Proc. 32(e);5\n\nIsom, 85 F.3d at 834.     The burden of persuading the court that such\n\na reason exists is on the defendant.          See, e.g., United States v.\n\nMoore, 362 F.3d 129, 134 (1st Cir. 2004); cf. Browne, 318 F.3d at\n\n265 (holding that court need hear additional evidence in support of\n\na   change   of   plea   only   if   there   was   an   adequate   tender   by\n\ndefendant).       Rodríguez has offered no authority to support his\n\ncontention that, despite this burden, the district court was under\n\nan affirmative obligation to inquire further into his reasons for\n\ndissatisfaction with his plea.\n\n             We turn now to an evaluation of the reasons offered by\n\ndefense counsel.      We have identified several factors that must be\n\nconsidered in determining whether a defendant has shown a \"fair and\n\njust reason\" for withdrawing a plea,\n\n             the most significant of which is whether the\n             plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent\n             within the meaning of [Federal Rule of\n             Criminal Procedure 11].     The other factors\n             include 1) the force and plausibility of the\n             proferred reason; 2) the timing of the\n             request; 3) whether the defendant has asserted\n             his legal innocence; and 4) whether the\n             parties had reached a plea agreement.\n\n\n\n5\n    The provisions governing withdrawal of a guilty plea were\naltered and moved to Rule 11(d) by amendments that went into effect\nDecember 1, 2002. As Rodríguez's request was made prior to this\ndate, our analysis is under the standards applicable to the earlier\nRule 32(e). See United States v. Cheal, 389 F.3d 35, 41 n.6 (1st\nCir. 2004).\n\n                                      -8-\n\fIsom, 85 F.3d at 834 (quoting United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47\n\nF.3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal citations omitted)).        If\n\nthese factors weigh in favor of permitting a change of plea, we\n\nmust then consider the prejudicial effect such a change would have\n\non the prosecution.   Id. at 834-35.\n\n               1.   Rule 11\n\n          Rodríguez argues for the first time on appeal that he\n\nlacked competence to plead guilty, thus precluding a knowing,\n\nvoluntary and intelligent plea.       Competence to plead guilty is\n\ndetermined according to the same criteria as competence to stand\n\ntrial:   the defendant must \"understand[] the proceedings against\n\nhim and ha[ve] sufficient present ability to consult with his\n\nlawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.\" United\n\nStates v. Lebrón, 76 F.3d 29, 31 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing Dusky v.\n\nUnited States, 362 U.S. 402 (1960)).     In the absence of objection\n\nbelow, we review for plain error.6     Olano, 507 U.S. at 732.\n\n\n6\n  Given that defense counsel expressly withdrew opposition to the\nmagistrate judge's Report and Recommendation -- which contained a\nfinding of competence to stand trial -- and read testimony from the\npsychological experts \"where competence is highlighted\" at the\nchange of plea hearing, it could very likely be determined that the\nissue of competence was waived. See United States v. Rodríguez,\n311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"A party waives a right when he\nintentionally relinquishes or abandons it. . . . [A] waived issue\nordinarily cannot be resurrected on appeal . . . .\") (internal\ncitations omitted).    Nevertheless, defense counsel's assertions\nwere made in the context of addressing Rodríguez's withdrawal of\nhis objection to the magistrate judge's recommendation of transfer\nto adult status, and the Report and Recommendation's findings\nconcerning competency were not explicitly addressed. Accordingly,\nand in view of the concerns generated by Rodríguez's age and mental\n\n                                -9-\n\f              In support of the argument that he lacked competence to\n\nplead guilty, Rodríguez relies on the findings of the expert\n\nwitnesses Drs. Umpierre and Margarida.                        Among these findings are\n\nthat   he     had   an    IQ    of    62,    within       the       range    of     mild   mental\n\nretardation, and that he suffers from brain dysfunction, which\n\naffects in particular his memory and ability to process language.\n\nRodríguez also cites Dr. Umpierre's testimony at his transfer\n\nhearing that \"[h]e will have problems dealing with information,\n\nanalyzing it and responding in a very more mature or abstract way\n\nof responding.\" Transfer Hearing Transcript at 48. Dr. Margarida,\n\nthe    defense      expert,         found    in     her       report        that    Rodríguez's\n\n\"understanding of the legal process and functions of the court\n\nofficials was at best simplistic and primitive.\"                              At the transfer\n\nhearing, she also testified that Rodríguez would have difficulty\n\nassisting      in   his     defense,         that      his    attorney        would    have    to\n\ndiligently check to ensure he was understanding the proceedings,\n\nand    that    he   might      be    inclined       to       give    faulty        answers   when\n\nquestioned in order to appease the questioner or to mislead the\n\ncourt in order to preserve his own self-interest.\n\n              In    her   Report       and     Recommendation,              Magistrate       Judge\n\nDelgado     reviewed      the       findings      of    both    experts        in    evaluating\n\nRodríguez's intellectual capacity, a component of the transfer\n\n\n\nlimitations, we will assume for the sake of analysis that the issue\nof competence has merely been forfeited, not waived.\n\n                                             -10-\n\fdecision. In a separate section of the report, she also determined\n\nthat Rodríguez was competent to stand trial.              This determination\n\nwas made on the basis of findings from both psychologists.                 She\n\nnoted that Dr. Umpierre determined that Rodríguez's mental status\n\nwas within normal limits, and that he was not psychotic.                Report\n\nand   Recommendation   at     22.      The    magistrate     judge   discussed\n\nDr.   Margarida's   findings    that    Rodríguez     could    offer    only   a\n\nsimplistic description of court proceedings, but noted that he\n\nnonetheless could understand the roles of court proceedings and\n\nofficials.    Id.      When    directly      asked   about   competency,   the\n\nmagistrate judge indicated, Dr. Margarida had stated that there are\n\ndifferent levels of competency and that Rodríguez was capable of\n\nremembering general details and narrating facts.               Id.     Finally,\n\nthe magistrate judge reported that \"it is understood [Rodríguez]\n\nwill be able to communicate with counsel.               For example, it is\n\nconsidered that if explained to him, [Rodríguez] may understand the\n\nimplications of an 'alibi' defense and will be able to provide\n\nfacts and information in support.\"           Id. at 23.\n\n           Prior to discussing Rodríguez's guilty plea at the change\n\nof plea hearing, the district judge inquired about the defense's\n\nreasons for withdrawing objection to the Report and Recommendation,\n\nfocusing primarily on the recommendation of transfer to adult\n\nstatus.   In response, defense counsel reviewed portions of the\n\nevidence from both psychological experts \"where competence is\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fhighlighted.\"          Change of Plea Transcript at 7.              In particular,\n\ncounsel noted that the prosecution expert had found Rodríguez to be\n\nin general contact with reality; responsive in a logical and\n\ncoherent manner; capable of understanding the purpose of his\n\npsychological evaluation; not delusional or psychotic; articulate\n\nin   an   immature      way;   able    to     remember,   interpret       information\n\ncoherently, and carry out general care; that he understood the\n\nnature     of    the     accusations        against     him   and   the     potential\n\nconsequences of a long prison sentence; and that he had a general\n\nunderstanding      of    the   court,        defense,    prosecution      and   judge,\n\nalthough he did not understand the role of the jury.                            Defense\n\ncounsel indicated that the defense expert had agreed with the\n\nprosecution's expert's findings.7               Id. at 6-7.\n\n            The    district     judge        then   engaged    in    dialogue     with\n\nRodríguez,       who    affirmed      that     he   understood      his   attorney's\n\nexplanations, the plea agreement, the potential length of his\n\nsentence, and the potential consequences of opting to go to trial\n\ninstead.        Id. at 10-13.      The district judge determined that:\n\n            [t]here is a finding that based on the\n            assessment of both experts in psychology that\n            they consider that Víctor Rodríguez is\n\n\n7\n  When questioned at the evidentiary hearing before the magistrate\njudge on whether Rodríguez was competent to stand trial,\nDr. Margarida stated, \"Yes, again it depends on, you know, a legal\nterm or what.

[H]aving heard from counsel and the\n             defendant and having reviewed the Magistrate’s\n             report and recommendation, the court will\n             accept the same and will accept the waiver of\n             the defendant for any further transfer\n             proceedings and the court hereby orders that\n             the defendant be processed, continues to be\n             processed in this court as an adult.\n\nId. at 15-16.       The district judge then questioned Rodríguez in\n\ndetail about his understanding of the implications of waiving grand\n\njury indictment and deemed him competent to do so, finding that:\n\n             [h]e understands the explanations made by his\n             attorney as to the waiver of indictment by\n             grand jury and also from my questioning here\n             in court, I can see that he is reacting\n             positive[ly] to my questions and it appears to\n             me that he is understanding the right that he\n             has to be indicted by a grand jury and the\n             results of waiving that indictment by a grand\n             jury.\n\nId. at 18.\n\n             The   district   judge   considered   the   findings   of   both\n\npsychological experts, the detailed findings and recommendation of\n\nthe magistrate judge regarding competence, and his own direct\n\nperception of the content and manner of Rodríguez's responses to\n\nquestioning.       While the evidence in favor of competence was not\n\noverwhelming, the district court did not plainly err in finding\n\nRodríguez competent.\n\n             Beyond competence, three core concerns guide our review\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fof whether Rodríguez's plea met the requirements of Rule 11:           (1)\n\nabsence of coercion, (2) understanding of the charges, and (3)\n\nknowledge of the consequences of the plea.         Isom, 85 F.3d at 835.\n\nBecause no objection was raised below, we review the court's\n\nacceptance of Rodríguez's plea for plain error.          See Olano, 507\n\nU.S. at 732; United States v. Mescual-Cruz, 387 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n2004). We do so with awareness of the concern that Rodríguez's age\n\nand   significant   mental   limitations   could   affect   the   knowing,\n\nvoluntary and intelligent nature of his plea. See United States v.\n\nMartínez-Martínez, 69 F.3d 1215, 1220 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"Whether the\n\nexplanation of the charges and determination of the defendant's\n\nunderstanding are sufficient for Rule 11 purposes varies depending\n\nupon . . . the capacity of the defendant, and the attendant\n\ncircumstances.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           During a thorough plea colloquy, the district judge made\n\ndirect inquiries sufficient to establish that all three core Rule\n\n11 concerns had been met.       Rodríguez affirmed8 that he was not\n\n\n8\n   Rodríguez's responses most often came in the form of one-word\nanswers, but Judge Pérez Giménez appears to have been satisfied\nthat the \"yes\" or \"no\" answers were not automatic, but rather based\non an understanding of the substance of the questions. In making\nthese determinations, the district judge had the benefit of\ndirectly perceiving Rodríguez's demeanor while responding.      Cf.\nUnited States v. Jiménez-Villasenor, 270 F.3d 554, 560 (8th Cir.\n2001) (noting district court's opportunity to observe demeanor of\ndefendant who had ingested sedatives in finding no clear error in\ndetermination of competence). Furthermore, the one-word answers\nwere responsive to yes-or-no questions. In this case, we will not\nsecond-guess the district judge's acceptance of Rodríguez's one-\nword responses.\n\n                                  -14-\n\fthreatened or forced to waive indictment, Change of Plea Transcript\n\nat 16, and that he was not threatened, forced, or enticed to plead\n\nguilty.   Id. at 23, 28.      He affirmed that he understood the charges\n\nagainst him, as detailed by the district judge, Id. at 18-19,\n\nadmitted to guilt on those charges, id. at 29, 32, and affirmed\n\nthat his plea was made freely and voluntarily because he was, in\n\nfact, guilty.        Id. at 28.      Rodríguez indicated that he knew the\n\npotential sentence to be ten years to life.                Id. at 22.     Judge\n\nPérez Giménez went through the specifics of the plea agreement, and\n\nasked questions to ensure that Rodríguez understood the recommended\n\nsentence and that the judge would be free to impose a higher\n\nsentence if he so chose.          Id. at 24-28.    Judge Pérez Giménez also\n\nquestioned     and    received    affirmation     from    Rodríguez    that   he\n\nunderstood the terms of supervised release after the sentence was\n\nserved, id., and that parole was unavailable, id. at 28.                  Judge\n\nPérez   Giménez      also   delved    further   into     Rodríguez's   apparent\n\nreluctance to accept the plea after Rodríguez indicated that he had\n\nspoken to his mother and other relatives, who felt, as he did, that\n\nthe recommended 240-month sentence was too long.              Id. at 10.      The\n\ndistrict judge asked why, in that case, he was accepting the plea\n\nagreement, and Rodríguez indicated that he did so because he felt\n\nhe could not get a more favorable agreement.              Id. at 10-13.\n\n             The colloquy summarized above was comprehensive, and the\n\ndistrict judge adequately investigated the knowing, voluntary, and\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fintelligent nature of Rodríguez's plea.           Thus, we find no plain\n\nerror.\n\n                  2.    Other factors\n\n           Beyond compliance with Rule 11, other factors to be\n\nconsidered in determining whether a defendant has offered a \"fair\n\nand just\" reason for withdrawing a guilty plea are \"1) the force\n\nand plausibility of the proferred reason; 2) the timing of the\n\nrequest; 3) whether the defendant has asserted his legal innocence;\n\nand 4) whether the parties had reached a plea agreement.\"            Isom, 85\n\nF.3d at    834   (quoting    Cotal-Crespo,   47   F.3d   at   3-4   (internal\n\ncitations omitted)).        Each of these factors weighs against plea\n\nwithdrawal in the instant case.\n\n           When asked why his client wished not to be sentenced\n\naccording to the plea agreement, defense counsel stated, \"I don't\n\nsee any reasoning other than the generic attitude of his father now\n\nthat our plea agreement is not a satisfactory plea agreement for\n\nhis father [who had reached a plea agreement on related drug\n\ncharges for a sentence of 18.5 years] and, therefore, for him\n\n. . . .\"   Sentencing Transcript at 4.       Neither Rodríguez's, nor his\n\nfather's, dissatisfaction with the length of the sentence imposed\n\nby the plea agreement required the district court to permit a\n\nchange of plea.        See Miranda-González v. United States, 181 F.3d\n\n164, 165 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"A guilty plea will not be set aside\n\nwhere a defendant has had a change of heart simply because . . . he\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fis not satisfied with the sentence he has received.\"); see also\n\nUnited States v. Elias, 937 F.2d 1514, 1520 (10th Cir. 1991) (\"A\n\ndefendant's   dissatisfaction   with   the   length    of   his   sentence\n\ngenerally is insufficient reason to withdraw a plea.\"). The timing\n\nof Rodríguez's request, which occurred at the sentencing hearing\n\nover two months after entering his guilty plea, also calls the\n\nfairness and justice of permitting a change into question.            See,\n\ne.g., Isom, 85 F.3d at 838 (\"We have repeatedly noted that the more\n\na request is delayed -- even if made before sentence is imposed --\n\nthe more we will regard it with disfavor.\").          No reason has been\n\noffered for this delay, nor did any change of circumstances occur\n\nin the interval to support a change of plea.          Rodríguez has not\n\nasserted his innocence of the charged offenses, and the guilty plea\n\nwas properly accepted as part of a voluntary plea agreement. Thus,\n\nall four of the Isom factors weigh against permitting a change of\n\nplea.\n\n          Nevertheless, Rodríguez argues that an additional factor\n\nshould be weighed in favor of permitting a change of plea:             the\n\nmagistrate judge's recommendation that he be transferred to adult\n\nstatus was, he now argues, erroneous. Although Rodríguez initially\n\nfiled an objection to the magistrate's Report and Recommendation,\n\nhis counsel explicitly withdrew the objection, see Change of Plea\n\nTranscript at 4, and submitted a motion to the district court for\n\nRodríguez to be proceeded against as an adult.         A party waives a\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fright when he intentionally relinquishes or abandons it, and a\n\nwaived issue ordinarily cannot be raised on appeal.           See United\n\nStates v. Rodríguez, 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002); United\n\nStates v. Mitchell, 85 F.3d 800, 807 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"[W]here\n\nthere was forfeiture, we apply a plain error analysis; where there\n\nwas waiver, we do not.\") (citing United States v. Lakich, 23 F.3d\n\n1203, 1207 (7th Cir. 1994) (noting that \"if there has been a valid\n\nwaiver, there is no 'error' for us to correct\").         Accordingly, we\n\nwill not evaluate the merits of the decision to transfer Rodríguez\n\nto adult status.     The issue was waived, and may not be revived\n\ncollaterally during our review of Rodríguez's wish to change his\n\nplea.\n\n            Rodríguez admitted to the factual bases of the charged\n\noffenses and affirmed that he had knowingly, intelligently, and\n\nvoluntarily entered into a plea agreement with the government. The\n\ndistrict court did not plainly err in finding Rodríguez competent\n\nto enter the guilty plea, nor in accepting the plea within the\n\nstrictures   of   Rule   11.   Almost   three   months   later,   with   no\n\nexplanation for the delay, Rodríguez offered only his and his\n\nfather's dissatisfaction with the sentence as a reason for changing\n\nhis plea.    Even considering Rodríguez's impaired mental capacity,\n\nwe cannot find that the district court abused its discretion by\n\ndeclining to permit a change of plea under these circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f            B.   Motion for continuance\n\n            Rodríguez also posits that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to continue sentencing, arguing on appeal that\n\nthe district court ought to have granted the continuance in order\n\nto more fully explore Rodríguez's reasons for dissatisfaction with\n\nhis plea.    As we determined above, the burden of showing a valid\n\nreason for seeking to withdraw the guilty plea was on the defense,\n\nand the     district judge was under no obligation to investigate\n\nfurther.\n\n            \"We grant broad discretion to a trial court to decide a\n\ncontinuance motion and will only find abuse of that discretion with\n\na showing that the court exhibited an unreasonable and arbitrary\n\ninsistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable\n\nrequest for delay.\"     United States v. Rodríguez-Marrero, 390 F.3d\n\n1, 21-22 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).               On\n\nreview, we consider, inter alia, \"the delay entailed, the reasons\n\nfor   the   request,   whether   the   moving   party   is   at   fault,   any\n\ninconvenience to the court and litigants, and whether the denial of\n\na continuance unfairly would prejudice the moving party.\" Bogosian\n\nv. Woloohojian Realty Corp., 323 F.3d 55, 63 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            The reasons offered for continuance were the impending\n\nsentencing of Rodríguez's father, along with both Rodríguez's and\n\nhis   father's   dissatisfaction       with   the   length   of   Rodríguez's\n\nsentence.    As discussed above, dissatisfaction with the length of\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fa sentence is insufficient to require a change of plea.             Moreover,\n\neven if sentencing had been postponed until after Rodríguez's\n\nfather received the expected shorter sentence on related charges,\n\nthis would not have entitled Rodríguez to change his plea.                   See\n\nUnited States v. Santiago, 229 F.3d 313, 317 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(finding   that   the    fact   that    defendant's     co-conspirators      had\n\nreceived lesser sentences lacked merit as a reason for permitting\n\na change of plea).      Furthermore, after questioning defense counsel\n\nabout the reason for seeking continuance at length, the district\n\njudge concluded that the plea agreement was the best Rodríguez\n\ncould obtain and that continuing sentencing would have had the\n\nnegative effect of returning Rodríguez to the same detention\n\nfacility as his father, who exerted a negative influence on him.\n\nThus, denial of the request did not cause unfair prejudice to\n\nRodríguez, whereas its grant would have inconvenienced the court\n\nand litigants. The district judge's decision to deny a continuance\n\nis not the kind of manifest abuse of discretion that would merit\n\nreversal by this court.\n\n                             III.      Conclusion\n\n           For    the   reasons   stated      above,   the   decision   of   the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\f",

Defendant-appellant Víctor\n\nRodríguez León (\"Rodríguez\") entered into a plea agreement on one\n\ncount of aiding and abetting in the possession with intent to\n\ndistribute and/or distribution of multiple kilograms of controlled\n\nsubstances, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a), for his involvement\n\nbetween the ages of nine and seventeen1 in a drug organization in\n\nwhich both of his parents were also involved.        He alleges that his\n\ncompetence to plead guilty was questionable and that a magistrate\n\njudge erroneously recommended that he be transferred to adult\n\nstatus.   Consequently, he argues, the district court erred in\n\nrefusing to continue sentencing proceedings in order to investigate\n\nhis apparent dissatisfaction with his guilty plea. Because we find\n\nno abuse of discretion in the district court's acceptance of the\n\nguilty plea, failure to permit its withdrawal, or refusal to\n\ncontinue sentencing, the decision below is affirmed.\n\n                            I.   Background\n\n          On   September   19,   2001,   Rodríguez   was   charged   as   a\n\njuvenile in a sealed criminal complaint for conspiracy to possess\n\nwith intent to distribute narcotics, in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n\n\n1\n   Rodríguez was born on September 14, 1983, but the government's\nbrief indicates that he was seventeen and a half years old when he\nwas charged on September 19, 2001 and appellant's brief indicates\nthat he was nineteen years old at the time of his transfer hearing\non May 3, 2002. Regardless of these discrepancies, there appears\nto be agreement that Rodríguez's active participation in the drug\norganization occurred when he was between the ages of nine and\nseventeen.\n\n                                  -2-\n\f§ 846.   On September 21, 2001, Rodríguez plead not guilty to the\n\ncharge and was placed in pretrial detention.   On December 4, 2001,\n\nthe government filed a Motion to Transfer to Adult Status, and\n\namended the charge to aiding and abetting in the possession with\n\nintent to distribute and/or distribution of multiple kilograms of\n\ncontrolled substances, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a).\n\n          An evidentiary hearing was held before Magistrate Judge\n\nAida M. Delgado Colón on May 3, 2001.    At the hearing, Dr. Luis\n\nFrancisco Umpierre, a clinical psychologist, and Dr. Maria T.\n\nMargarida Juliá, a clinical neuropsychologist, testified on behalf\n\nof the Government and Rodríguez, respectively.        Dr. Umpierre\n\ndetermined that Rodríguez has an IQ of 62, corresponding to mild\n\nmental retardation, and both experts found evidence of cognitive\n\ndysfunction or brain damage.    On June 13, 2002, the magistrate\n\njudge issued a detailed Report and Recommendation.   In the Report,\n\nshe made specific findings on each of the six factors that 18\n\nU.S.C. § 5032 directs judicial officers to consider in deciding on\n\ntransfer to adult status.2     She found that Rodríguez's prior\n\n\n\n\n2\n   The factors are \"[1] the age and social background of the\njuvenile; [2] the nature of the alleged offense; [3] the extent and\nnature of the juvenile's prior delinquency record; [4] the\njuvenile's present intellectual development and psychological\nmaturity; [5] the nature of past treatment efforts and the\njuvenile's response to such efforts; [and 6] the availability of\nprograms designed to treat the juvenile's behavioral problems.\" 18\nU.S.C. 5032. The guiding principle in weighing these factors is\nwhether \"transfer would be in the interest of justice.\" Id.\n\n                               -3-\n\fdelinquency record,3 poor response to probationary supervision and\n\ncorresponding need for an institutional rehabilitation program, and\n\nmental limitations on judgment and emotional control, in addition\n\nto the lack of evidence of the existence of adequate non-penal\n\nrehabilitation programs to suit Rodríguez's needs, all weighed in\n\nfavor of transfer to adult status.         In addition, the magistrate\n\njudge found that the nature of the alleged offense -- including\n\nreliable   government   evidence   of    Rodríguez's   participation   in\n\nmurders and \"hunting\" rival drug gang members -- was sufficient,\n\nstanding alone, to warrant transfer to adult status.\n\n           The magistrate judge also made findings as to Rodríguez's\n\ncompetency to stand trial.     She determined, on the basis of the\n\npsychological reports, that although his mental and judgmental\n\ncapacities were limited, Rodríguez was capable of distinguishing\n\nright from wrong, understanding if one penalty was harsher than\n\nanother, understanding the implications of an alibi defense and\n\nassisting his counsel by providing facts and information in support\n\n\n\n3\n   Between December 2000 and February 2001, Rodríguez was found\nguilty of possession of cocaine and six counts of possession of a\nfirearm; arrested on charges of attempted murder, first degree\nmurder, conspiracy to commit murder, and additional weapons\nviolations; and charged with four counts of illegal appropriation\nof a vehicle. He was charged as an adult in the District of Puerto\nRico in these cases.     Additionally, Rodríguez was charged in\ncommonwealth court with possession of drug paraphernalia and 135\nbags of cocaine intended for distribution.            Commonwealth\nproceedings to transfer Rodríguez to adult status on these charges\nwere underway at the time the magistrate judge rendered her Report\nand Recommendation.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fthereof.   Thus, she concluded, he was competent to stand trial and\n\nassist defense counsel.\n\n           Rodríguez initially filed a sealed objection to the\n\nReport   and   Recommendation,   but    just   over   a   month   later,   he\n\nsubmitted a motion to proceed against him as an adult.            The motion\n\nstates that \"upon advise [sic] of counsel, [Rodríguez] voluntarily\n\nwaives all further transfer procedures in this case [and] requests\n\nto be proceeded against as an adult for purposes of criminal\n\nprosecution in this case.\"   The same day, he waived indictment and\n\nplead guilty to one count of distribution of various narcotic\n\ndrugs, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a).\n\n           At the change of plea hearing before district court judge\n\nJuan M. Pérez Giménez, Rodríguez's counsel orally withdrew his\n\nopposition to the Report and Recommendation.              After questioning\n\nRodríguez directly, the district judge accepted the Report and\n\nRecommendation and waiver of transfer proceedings, found Rodríguez\n\ncompetent to waive indictment, and accepted his guilty plea.\n\n           A sentencing hearing was held on November 22, 2002.             At\n\nthe hearing, the following exchange occurred between the district\n\njudge and Rodríguez's counsel:\n\n     MR. ANGLADA: Your Honor, let me put something on the\n     record before we start. I am ready for sentence and we\n     have reviewed the PSI with the client. The client would\n     like the sentence to be continued. One of the reasons is\n     that his mother was already sentenced and his father is\n     to be sentenced at an adjacent court on December 10th.\n     We are within the thirty-five days. I am ready but I\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fhave the duty and the loyalty to my client to inform the\ncourt that he would prefer sentencing to be continued.\n\nTHE COURT: What is the reason?\n\nMR. ANGLADA: The reason, Your Honor, is that he would\nprefer sentence not to be imposed in accordance with the\nwritten plea agreement. His father is to be sentenced by\nthe Honorable Court if the plea is accepted by that\nneighboring court for a prison term of eighteen and a\nhalf years and, of course, I am bound by the plea\nagreement before this court and this plea calls for the\nimposition of a sentence of thirty seven points with a\ncriminal history of two for the imposition of a sentence\nof 240 months.

ANGLADA: Your Honor, in my opinion I don't see any\nreasoning other than the generic attitude of his father\nnow that our plea agreement is not a satisfactory plea\nagreement for his father and, therefore, for him,\nremember that he is now 18 or 19 and his IQ is one of 62.\nNow he is with his father at MDC and now he is again\nunder the influence of his father.\n\n....\n\nTHE COURT: Again my question is, do you think it would be\nbeneficial for him to continue now under his father's\nsupervision or if I sentence him today ask the Marshals\nto transport him out of Puerto Rico, so he is not under\nthat influence, which apparently is a very bad influence.\n\nMR. ANGLADA: Well, Your Honor, as an attorney, as a\nfather, I have an opinion.     I don't want to further\njeopardize my relationship to him, so, you know, I don't\nknow, if you are going to accept my words as an answer.\n\n....\n\nTHE COURT: . . . . [W]e will proceed to sentence the\ndefendant today. I think that your actions in this case\nwere professionally carried out. You obtained the best\nplea agreement you could with the government under the\ncircumstances and I would rather have him be sentenced\n\n                          -6-\n\f     today than leave the door open that might create problems\n     between yourself and your client, which apparently they\n     have been a very fruitful relationship.\n\nSentencing Transcript at 3-6 (emphasis supplied). Without directly\n\nasking Rodríguez to clarify his reasons for wanting a continuance,\n\nJudge Pérez Giménez sentenced him to 235 months in prison, eight\n\nyears supervised release, and a $100 assessment.\n\n            Rodríguez appealed, claiming that his counsel's remarks\n\nat sentencing put the court on notice that he was challenging the\n\nplea agreement and sought to withdraw his plea.                        Accordingly,\n\nRodríguez   argues     that    the    court   erred    in   failing     to   further\n\ninvestigate whether he was entitled to a change of plea, and in\n\ndenying the requested continuance.\n\n                                II.

Nevertheless, defense counsel's assertions\nwere made in the context of addressing Rodríguez's withdrawal of\nhis objection to the magistrate judge's recommendation of transfer\nto adult status, and the Report and Recommendation's findings\nconcerning competency were not explicitly addressed.

Among these findings are\n\nthat   he     had   an    IQ    of    62,    within       the       range    of     mild   mental\n\nretardation, and that he suffers from brain dysfunction, which\n\naffects in particular his memory and ability to process language.\n\nRodríguez also cites Dr. Umpierre's testimony at his transfer\n\nhearing that \"[h]e will have problems dealing with information,\n\nanalyzing it and responding in a very more mature or abstract way\n\nof responding.\" Transfer Hearing Transcript at 48. Dr. Margarida,\n\nthe    defense      expert,         found    in     her       report        that    Rodríguez's\n\n\"understanding of the legal process and functions of the court\n\nofficials was at best simplistic and primitive.\"                              At the transfer\n\nhearing, she also testified that Rodríguez would have difficulty\n\nassisting      in   his     defense,         that      his    attorney        would    have    to\n\ndiligently check to ensure he was understanding the proceedings,\n\nand    that    he   might      be    inclined       to       give    faulty        answers   when\n\nquestioned in order to appease the questioner or to mislead the\n\ncourt in order to preserve his own self-interest.\n\n              In    her   Report       and     Recommendation,              Magistrate       Judge\n\nDelgado     reviewed      the       findings      of    both    experts        in    evaluating\n\nRodríguez's intellectual capacity, a component of the transfer\n\n\n\nlimitations, we will assume for the sake of analysis that the issue\nof competence has merely been forfeited, not waived.\n\n                                             -10-\n\fdecision. In a separate section of the report, she also determined\n\nthat Rodríguez was competent to stand trial.              This determination\n\nwas made on the basis of findings from both psychologists.                 She\n\nnoted that Dr. Umpierre determined that Rodríguez's mental status\n\nwas within normal limits, and that he was not psychotic.                Report\n\nand   Recommendation   at     22.      The    magistrate     judge   discussed\n\nDr.   Margarida's   findings    that    Rodríguez     could    offer    only   a\n\nsimplistic description of court proceedings, but noted that he\n\nnonetheless could understand the roles of court proceedings and\n\nofficials.    Id.      When    directly      asked   about   competency,   the\n\nmagistrate judge indicated, Dr. Margarida had stated that there are\n\ndifferent levels of competency and that Rodríguez was capable of\n\nremembering general details and narrating facts.               Id.     Finally,\n\nthe magistrate judge reported that \"it is understood [Rodríguez]\n\nwill be able to communicate with counsel.               For example, it is\n\nconsidered that if explained to him, [Rodríguez] may understand the\n\nimplications of an 'alibi' defense and will be able to provide\n\nfacts and information in support.\"           Id. at 23.\n\n           Prior to discussing Rodríguez's guilty plea at the change\n\nof plea hearing, the district judge inquired about the defense's\n\nreasons for withdrawing objection to the Report and Recommendation,\n\nfocusing primarily on the recommendation of transfer to adult\n\nstatus.   In response, defense counsel reviewed portions of the\n\nevidence from both psychological experts \"where competence is\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fhighlighted.\"          Change of Plea Transcript at 7.              In particular,\n\ncounsel noted that the prosecution expert had found Rodríguez to be\n\nin general contact with reality; responsive in a logical and\n\ncoherent manner; capable of understanding the purpose of his\n\npsychological evaluation; not delusional or psychotic; articulate\n\nin   an   immature      way;   able    to     remember,   interpret       information\n\ncoherently, and carry out general care; that he understood the\n\nnature     of    the     accusations        against     him   and   the     potential\n\nconsequences of a long prison sentence; and that he had a general\n\nunderstanding      of    the   court,        defense,    prosecution      and   judge,\n\nalthough he did not understand the role of the jury.

The district judge then questioned Rodríguez in\n\ndetail about his understanding of the implications of waiving grand\n\njury indictment and deemed him competent to do so, finding that:\n\n             [h]e understands the explanations made by his\n             attorney as to the waiver of indictment by\n             grand jury and also from my questioning here\n             in court, I can see that he is reacting\n             positive[ly] to my questions and it appears to\n             me that he is understanding the right that he\n             has to be indicted by a grand jury and the\n             results of waiving that indictment by a grand\n             jury.\n\nId. at 18.\n\n             The   district   judge   considered   the   findings   of   both\n\npsychological experts, the detailed findings and recommendation of\n\nthe magistrate judge regarding competence, and his own direct\n\nperception of the content and manner of Rodríguez's responses to\n\nquestioning.       While the evidence in favor of competence was not\n\noverwhelming, the district court did not plainly err in finding\n\nRodríguez competent.\n\n             Beyond competence, three core concerns guide our review\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fof whether Rodríguez's plea met the requirements of Rule 11:           (1)\n\nabsence of coercion, (2) understanding of the charges, and (3)\n\nknowledge of the consequences of the plea.

Other factors\n\n           Beyond compliance with Rule 11, other factors to be\n\nconsidered in determining whether a defendant has offered a \"fair\n\nand just\" reason for withdrawing a guilty plea are \"1) the force\n\nand plausibility of the proferred reason; 2) the timing of the\n\nrequest; 3) whether the defendant has asserted his legal innocence;\n\nand 4) whether the parties had reached a plea agreement.\"            Isom, 85\n\nF.3d at    834   (quoting    Cotal-Crespo,   47   F.3d   at   3-4   (internal\n\ncitations omitted)).        Each of these factors weighs against plea\n\nwithdrawal in the instant case.\n\n           When asked why his client wished not to be sentenced\n\naccording to the plea agreement, defense counsel stated, \"I don't\n\nsee any reasoning other than the generic attitude of his father now\n\nthat our plea agreement is not a satisfactory plea agreement for\n\nhis father [who had reached a plea agreement on related drug\n\ncharges for a sentence of 18.5 years] and, therefore, for him\n\n. . . .\"   Sentencing Transcript at 4.       Neither Rodríguez's, nor his\n\nfather's, dissatisfaction with the length of the sentence imposed\n\nby the plea agreement required the district court to permit a\n\nchange of plea.

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764881\"><a href=\"/opinion/764881/jesus-miranda-gonzalez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 165 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"A guilty plea will not be set aside\n\nwhere a defendant has had a change of heart simply because . . . he\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fis not satisfied with the sentence he has received.\"); see also\n\nUnited States v.

The timing\n\nof Rodríguez's request, which occurred at the sentencing hearing\n\nover two months after entering his guilty plea, also calls the\n\nfairness and justice of permitting a change into question.            See,\n\ne.g., Isom, 85 F.3d at 838 (\"We have repeatedly noted that the more\n\na request is delayed -- even if made before sentence is imposed --\n\nthe more we will regard it with disfavor.\").          No reason has been\n\noffered for this delay, nor did any change of circumstances occur\n\nin the interval to support a change of plea.          Rodríguez has not\n\nasserted his innocence of the charged offenses, and the guilty plea\n\nwas properly accepted as part of a voluntary plea agreement. Thus,\n\nall four of the Isom factors weigh against permitting a change of\n\nplea.\n\n          Nevertheless, Rodríguez argues that an additional factor\n\nshould be weighed in favor of permitting a change of plea:             the\n\nmagistrate judge's recommendation that he be transferred to adult\n\nstatus was, he now argues, erroneous. Although Rodríguez initially\n\nfiled an objection to the magistrate's Report and Recommendation,\n\nhis counsel explicitly withdrew the objection, see Change of Plea\n\nTranscript at 4, and submitted a motion to the district court for\n\nRodríguez to be proceeded against as an adult.         A party waives a\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fright when he intentionally relinquishes or abandons it, and a\n\nwaived issue ordinarily cannot be raised on appeal.

Accordingly, we\n\nwill not evaluate the merits of the decision to transfer Rodríguez\n\nto adult status.     The issue was waived, and may not be revived\n\ncollaterally during our review of Rodríguez's wish to change his\n\nplea.\n\n            Rodríguez admitted to the factual bases of the charged\n\noffenses and affirmed that he had knowingly, intelligently, and\n\nvoluntarily entered into a plea agreement with the government. The\n\ndistrict court did not plainly err in finding Rodríguez competent\n\nto enter the guilty plea, nor in accepting the plea within the\n\nstrictures   of   Rule   11.   Almost   three   months   later,   with   no\n\nexplanation for the delay, Rodríguez offered only his and his\n\nfather's dissatisfaction with the sentence as a reason for changing\n\nhis plea.    Even considering Rodríguez's impaired mental capacity,\n\nwe cannot find that the district court abused its discretion by\n\ndeclining to permit a change of plea under these circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f            B.   Motion for continuance\n\n            Rodríguez also posits that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to continue sentencing, arguing on appeal that\n\nthe district court ought to have granted the continuance in order\n\nto more fully explore Rodríguez's reasons for dissatisfaction with\n\nhis plea.    As we determined above, the burden of showing a valid\n\nreason for seeking to withdraw the guilty plea was on the defense,\n\nand the     district judge was under no obligation to investigate\n\nfurther.\n\n            \"We grant broad discretion to a trial court to decide a\n\ncontinuance motion and will only find abuse of that discretion with\n\na showing that the court exhibited an unreasonable and arbitrary\n\ninsistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable\n\nrequest for delay.\"     United States v.

On\n\nreview, we consider, inter alia, \"the delay entailed, the reasons\n\nfor   the   request,   whether   the   moving   party   is   at   fault,   any\n\ninconvenience to the court and litigants, and whether the denial of\n\na continuance unfairly would prejudice the moving party.\" Bogosian\n\nv.

As discussed above, dissatisfaction with the length of\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fa sentence is insufficient to require a change of plea.             Moreover,\n\neven if sentencing had been postponed until after Rodríguez's\n\nfather received the expected shorter sentence on related charges,\n\nthis would not have entitled Rodríguez to change his plea.                   See\n\nUnited States v. Santiago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199121\"><a href=\"/opinion/199121/united-states-v-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 317 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(finding   that   the    fact   that    defendant's     co-conspirators      had\n\nreceived lesser sentences lacked merit as a reason for permitting\n\na change of plea).      Furthermore, after questioning defense counsel\n\nabout the reason for seeking continuance at length, the district\n\njudge concluded that the plea agreement was the best Rodríguez\n\ncould obtain and that continuing sentencing would have had the\n\nnegative effect of returning Rodríguez to the same detention\n\nfacility as his father, who exerted a negative influence on him.\n\nThus, denial of the request did not cause unfair prejudice to\n\nRodríguez, whereas its grant would have inconvenienced the court\n\nand litigants. The district judge's decision to deny a continuance\n\nis not the kind of manifest abuse of discretion that would merit\n\nreversal by this court.\n\n                             III.      Conclusion\n\n           For    the   reasons   stated      above,   the   decision   of   the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\f</pre>",
