R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 06-1651\n\n                               KOMI OFORI,\n\n                        Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                         RUBY TUESDAY, INC.,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n         [Hon. Paul J. Barbadoro,          U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                   Torruella, Lynch and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Komi Ofori on brief pro se.\n     Cornelius R. Heusel and Jones, Walker, Waechter, Poitevent,\nCarrére and Denégre, L.L.P. and Jennifer L. Parent and McLane,\nGraf, Raulerson and Middleton, Professional Association on brief\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                          November 17, 2006\n\f             Per Curiam.     This appeal follows the denial of pro se\n\nappellant Komi Ofori's motion for \"clarification\" of his earlier,\n\nunsuccessful motion for reconsideration of the district court's\n\ndecision granting summary judgment for his former employer, Ruby\n\nTuesday, Inc.    Because Ofori's notice of appeal is untimely as to\n\nboth   the   district   court's   January   27,   2006   summary   judgment\n\ndecision, as well as the district court's February 21, 2006 denial\n\nof his first motion to reconsider, we review only the denial of\n\nOfori's second post-judgment motion.\n\n             Eight days after the district court entered summary\n\njudgment for Ruby Tuesday dismissing each of Ofori's race and\n\nnational origin discrimination claims, Ofori filed a one-paragraph\n\nmotion   for    reconsideration    which    argued   that   Ruby    Tuesday\n\n\"falsified\" its \"issues to support their[] legitimate defenses to\n\nthe Honorable Court.\"      This motion failed to identify any error of\n\nlaw or fact in the court's summary judgment decision. Because this\n\nmotion was filed within ten days of entry of final judgment, it is\n\nproperly viewed as motion to alter or amend judgment pursuant to\n\nRule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.            Under Rule\n\n4(a)(4)(A) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the filing\n\nof this Rule 59(e) motion suspended the time for appealing the\n\nunderlying summary judgment decision until such time as the court\n\ndisposed of the motion.      Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d 10, 14\n\n(1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1078 (1998).\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f            The   district     court   summarily       denied   the    motion   on\n\nFebruary 21, 2006. A week later, Ofori filed a three-page pleading\n\ntitled \"Clarification,\" in which he explained in more detail the\n\nbasis for his original request for reconsideration.               Because this\n\npleading was filed more than ten days after the entry of final\n\njudgment, it is properly viewed as arising under Rule 60(b) of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.             Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A).\n\nRule 60(b) motions do not affect the time for appealing from the\n\nfinal judgment.    Acevedo-Villalobos v. Hernandez, 22 F.3d 384, 389\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1015 (1994). The district court\n\nsummarily denied this motion on March 6, 2006.\n\n            Ofori filed his notice of appeal on March 27, 2006.                 It\n\nis timely only as to the March 6, 2006 denial of Ofori's second\n\npost-judgment motion.        Construing this second motion as arising\n\nunder Rule 60(b), Ofori could only prevail in setting aside the\n\noriginal judgment if he could show \"exceptional circumstances\"\n\nentitling him to \"extraordinary relief.\" Rodriguez-Antuna v. Chase\n\nManhattan Bank Corp., 871 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting Lepore\n\nv.   Vidockler,   792   F.2d    272,   274    (1st   Cir.   1986)).      Ofori's\n\n\"Clarification\" fails to meet this exacting standard.                   \"We have\n\nmade   it   transparently    clear     that   relief    under   Rule    60(b)   is\n\n'extraordinary in nature'\" and that             \"motions invoking the rule\n\nshould be granted sparingly.\"          Cintron-Lorenzo v. Departmento de\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fAsuntos del Consumidor, 312 F.3d 522, 527 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting\n\nKarak v. Bursaw Oil Corp., 288 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 2002)).\n\n          After careful review of the pleadings, it is clear that\n\nthe district court properly exercised its discretion in denying\n\nOfori's   motion.     Each   of   the   arguments   presented   in   the\n\n\"Clarification\" was previously presented to and fully considered by\n\nthe district court.     Ofori attempts to reargue the facts, but\n\nsimple disagreement with the court's decision is not a basis for\n\nreconsideration.    \"[W]e recognize the district court's 'intimate,\n\nfirst-hand knowledge of the case,' and, thus, defer broadly to that\n\ncourt's informed discretion.\"      Cintron-Lorenzo, 312 F.3d at 527\n\n(quoting Karak, 288 F.3d at 19).\n\n          Insofar as Ofori's appeal seeks review of the January 27,\n\n2006 entry of summary judgment dismissing the case or the denial of\n\nhis first motion for reconsideration, it is dismissed for want of\n\nappellate jurisdiction.      The order of the district court denying\n\nOfori's second motion for reconsideration is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
