Brousseau and Kimball Brousseau\nLLP on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                               April 30, 2008\n\f           Per Curiam. Sean Holloway was fired from his position as\n\na maintenance worker for Thompson Island Outward Bound Education\n\nCenter, Inc. (\"TIOB\"), which is a non-profit organization operating\n\non one of the Boston Harbor Islands.            He brought suit in the\n\nfederal   district      court   for    Massachusetts,   alleging    racial\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII and the\n\nanalogous state law.     42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e (2000); Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n151B.   The court granted summary judgment to TIOB on both claims,\n\nHolloway v. Thompson Island Outward Bound Educ. Ctr., Inc., 492 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 20 (D. Mass. 2007); Holloway, litigating pro se, appeals.\n\n           The story begins in June 2004.        Holloway, who is black,\n\nwas then working on the kitchen staff.        He complained to TIOB about\n\nracial discrimination and harassment on the part of the kitchen\n\nsupervisor and a fellow employee (both white); the latter allegedly\n\nthreatened to kill Holloway.      In response, TIOB placed Holloway on\n\npaid leave and thereafter negotiated a settlement with his counsel.\n\nThe settlement agreement provided, inter alia, that Holloway would\n\nbe   transferred   to    the    maintenance    department,   that   future\n\nemployment disputes would be subject to arbitration, that Holloway\n\nwould not be terminated except for just cause and that TIOB would\n\npay Holloway's attorney's fees.\n\n           Holloway returned to work on July 19, 2004.          Less than\n\ntwo months later, he was terminated for insubordination, lateness,\n\nabsenteeism and threatening behavior.\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f            The premise of Holloway's suit is that he was actually\n\nfired because of his race or as retaliation for his earlier\n\ncomplaints.    Everything turns on motivation: there is no dispute\n\nthat Holloway is black, had engaged in protected conduct and was\n\nsubsequently terminated.            But if the cause of the firing was\n\ninsubordination or lateness or absenteeism--anything besides race\n\nor his previous complaint--then Holloway's claims fail.               Benoit v.\n\nTech. Mfg. Corp., 331 F.3d 166, 173-75 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            TIOB says that Holloway was consistently late for work;\n\nthat he was on various occasions absent without excuse; that he\n\nrefused to perform certain assigned tasks; that he was rude to his\n\nsupervisors    when      they   attempted    to    confront   him   over   these\n\nrecurring issues; and that two other employees complained that\n\nHolloway had behaved in a threatening manner toward them. TIOB has\n\nsubmitted affidavits from Holloway's supervisors and the record\n\nincludes as well a running file on Holloway kept by one of them.\n\n            Holloway admits that he often began work after 9:00 a.m.,\n\nbut says that the only ferry to the island sometimes arrived late\n\nand that the 9:00 a.m. rule was (at least in practice) applied\n\nstrictly only to the TIOB employees who lived on the island.                 He\n\nalso admits that he refused some orders, but explains that his\n\nsettlement with TIOB provided (implicitly) that he would not have\n\nto   work   with   the    kitchen   staff    who   had   threatened   him;   his\n\nrefusals, he says, were only attempts to enforce that right.\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fLikewise,   he   concedes   that   he    refused   to   discuss   with   his\n\nsupervisors some of the complaints they raised, e.g. about his\n\nlateness--referring them instead to his lawyers--but his settlement\n\ndid provide for arbitration of disputes and Holloway may have been\n\nconcerned about unintentionally waiving his rights during informal\n\ndiscussions.     He does acknowledge at least some of the absences\n\nTIOB attributes to him, but denies threatening anyone.\n\n            On this record, the prima facie case for discrimination\n\nis extremely weak. Those who terminated Holloway had nothing to do\n\nwith the kitchen staff who had harassed him.        There is certainly no\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination, and the circumstantial case is\n\nweakened--if not defeated altogether--by the fact that Holloway was\n\nreplaced by another black employee.          Shackelford v. Deloitte &\n\nTouche, LLP, 190 F.3d 398, 404 (5th Cir. 1999).\n\n            The evidence suggesting a possible retaliatory motive for\n\nthe firing is somewhat stronger, primarily because of the close\n\ntemporal proximity between Holloway's protected conduct and his\n\nfiring. Mariani-Colon v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 511 F.3d 216, 224\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).    The termination took place within two months of\n\nhis return to work following his complaints of racial harassment--\n\nan interval surely short enough at least to raise suspicions.\n\nId.; see also Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 355 F.3d 6,\n\n25-26 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f            But these suspicions can be authoritatively dispelled\n\n (and a fortiori the weaker discrimination claims defeated) by an\n\n employer's convincing account of the legitimate reasons for the\n\n firing.   McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 804-05\n\n (1973).   And TIOB has provided, with solid support in the record,\n\n a list of such reasons.     Holloway could only overcome this barrier\n\n by poking sufficient holes in TIOB's account to create a plausible\n\n inference that the reasons given for the discharge actually mask a\n\n forbidden retaliatory motive.\n\n            He has not done so.     Although he advanced the reasonable\n\n argument that if the first ferry to the island arrives after 9:00\n\n a.m., an employee should not (indeed, would not) be penalized for\n\n lateness, the record reveals that Holloway faced discipline for\n\n missing   the   ferry   entirely   or   for   not   checking   in   with   his\n\n department after its arrival--different matters entirely.1\n\n            And he has defended his refusal to follow orders by\n\n claiming that his settlement agreement entitled him to stay away\n\n from the kitchen staff, but the written agreement in the record\n\n contains no such provision and even if an oral side-agreement\n\n existed, the record reflects that Holloway's supervisors attempted\n\n\n     1\n      For example, the running file kept by Holloway's supervisor\nindicates that on August 10, \"Sean missed boat. Crew saw him drive\nonto EDIC dock @ 8:36 after they had already turned to seaward.\" On\nAugust 13, the file indicates that Holloway was instructed to be\n\"ready to work . . . directly from the 9:00 boat drop off.\" And on\nAugust 31, he was reprimanded because when \"the ferry arrived at\n9:15, [he] walked by our workshop and did not check in.\"\n\n                                     -5-\n\fto     accommodate    him    but        were    met     with     noncompliance     and\n\ninsubordination on a series of occasions. For example, the running\n\nfile    indicates    that   on   August        31,    Holloway    \"returned   to   Mr.\n\nTibbetts to voice [his] aversion to working with Mr. Eppinger.                      At\n\nthis time Mr. Tibbetts advised 'Fine, then just help Brendan and\n\nKenny get the rest of the stuff on the pier when they are done.'\"\n\nHowever it was later revealed that Holloway \"had not assisted with\n\nany moving of materials and had gone off to work on [his] own.\"\n\n            Holloway    cannot      explain      away    the     insubordination    by\n\nclaiming that his settlement provides for arbitration of disputes;\n\nTIOB might still legitimately take issue with his rudeness, use of\n\nobscenities    and    refusal      to    discuss      routine     matters   with   his\n\nsupervisors.     Merely as one instance among several, the running\n\nfile says that on August 13, Holloway's supervisor attempted:\n\n            to address [Holloway's] habit of being ready\n            for work at 9:30. He stated that it was the\n            way he did things and what he was accustomed\n            to and that he would not change this practice.\n            Made statements such as \"I don't need this\n            crap\" and \"I'm not even talking to you, send\n            it to my lawyer.\" . . . Told him to please\n            not ignore me or I will be forced to give him\n            negative written feedback for insubordination.\n            Said he did not care, \"whatever.\" . . .\n            [Later that day,] Sean made veiled threats\n            that \"You do not want to get involved in this\n            or you'll go down too.\"       Said that \"many\n            lawyers out there would love to get a piece of\n            this and I'm just tempted to call them.\"\n\n            Moreover, Holloway has not even attempted to respond to\n\nvarious other complaints about his work performance, such as his\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\frepeated practice of calling in sick after 9:00 a.m., in violation\n\nof TIOB policy.   (The running file indicates that Holloway called\n\nin sick after 9:00 a.m. on August 20 and August 24.)   Nor can all\n\nof his unexcused absences be justified by a family emergency that\n\napparently took place during late July and early August.       (The\n\nrecord supports TIOB's claims that Holloway was absent without\n\nexcuse on September 1, 2, and 7, among other days.)\n\n          In sum, TIOB has provided an extensive list of problems\n\nwith Holloway's performance, backed up by record support. Holloway\n\nhas no evidence that this documentary support (including the\n\nrunning file kept by his supervisor) was falsified in any way, and\n\nhis attempts to refute the reasons one-by-one are not persuasive.\n\nOn this record, no reasonable jury could find that the explanations\n\nfor his discharge were pretexts and therefore that his termination\n\nreflected discrimination or retaliation on the part of TIOB.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f",

At\n\nthis time Mr. Tibbetts advised 'Fine, then just help Brendan and\n\nKenny get the rest of the stuff on the pier when they are done.'\"\n\nHowever it was later revealed that Holloway \"had not assisted with\n\nany moving of materials and had gone off to work on [his] own.\"\n\n            Holloway    cannot      explain      away    the     insubordination    by\n\nclaiming that his settlement provides for arbitration of disputes;\n\nTIOB might still legitimately take issue with his rudeness, use of\n\nobscenities    and    refusal      to    discuss      routine     matters   with   his\n\nsupervisors.     Merely as one instance among several, the running\n\nfile says that on August 13, Holloway's supervisor attempted:\n\n            to address [Holloway's] habit of being ready\n            for work at 9:30. He stated that it was the\n            way he did things and what he was accustomed\n            to and that he would not change this practice.\n            Made statements such as \"I don't need this\n            crap\" and \"I'm not even talking to you, send\n            it to my lawyer.\" . . . Told him to please\n            not ignore me or I will be forced to give him\n            negative written feedback for insubordination.\n            Said he did not care, \"whatever.\" . . .\n            [Later that day,] Sean made veiled threats\n            that \"You do not want to get involved in this\n            or you'll go down too.\"       Said that \"many\n            lawyers out there would love to get a piece of\n            this and I'm just tempted to call them.\"\n\n            Moreover, Holloway has not even attempted to respond to\n\nvarious other complaints about his work performance, such as his\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\frepeated practice of calling in sick after 9:00 a.m., in violation\n\nof TIOB policy.   (The running file indicates that Holloway called\n\nin sick after 9:00 a.m. on August 20 and August 24.)   Nor can all\n\nof his unexcused absences be justified by a family emergency that\n\napparently took place during late July and early August.       (The\n\nrecord supports TIOB's claims that Holloway was absent without\n\nexcuse on September 1, 2, and 7, among other days.)\n\n          In sum, TIOB has provided an extensive list of problems\n\nwith Holloway's performance, backed up by record support. Holloway\n\nhas no evidence that this documentary support (including the\n\nrunning file kept by his supervisor) was falsified in any way, and\n\nhis attempts to refute the reasons one-by-one are not persuasive.\n\nOn this record, no reasonable jury could find that the explanations\n\nfor his discharge were pretexts and therefore that his termination\n\nreflected discrimination or retaliation on the part of TIOB.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f</pre>",
