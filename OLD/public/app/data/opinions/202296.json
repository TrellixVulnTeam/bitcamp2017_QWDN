This appeal arises out of the\n\ntragic death of a fourteen-year-old boy who fell into an open\n\nmanhole.    The plaintiffs, mostly relatives of the boy, sought\n\ndamages from various governmental and private defendants under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983 and state tort law.1            The district court dismissed\n\nthe federal law claims on grounds of Eleventh Amendment immunity\n\nand for failure to state a claim, and declined to exercise its\n\njurisdiction over the state law claims.           Because we find that (1)\n\nthe    Commonwealth     of   Puerto    Rico    (“Commonwealth”)   and    the\n\nCommonwealth       Department   of    Transportation   and   Public     Works\n\n(referred to in the pleadings by its Spanish-language acronym\n\n“DTOP”) did not waive their Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit\n\nand (2) plaintiffs’ claims against the remaining governmental\n\ndefendants do not rise to the level of a federal constitutional\n\nviolation, we affirm the dismissal.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n            Because the district court disposed of this case on\n\nmotions to dismiss, we assume the truth of the facts set forth in\n\nthe amended complaint.          See Redondo-Borges v. U.S. Dep’t. of\n\nHousing and Urban Dev., 421 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n\n      1\n       For all relevant purposes in this opinion, Puerto Rico is\ntreated as a state. See, e.g., Soto v. Flores, 103 F.3d 1056, 1064\n(1st Cir. 1997) (provisions of section 1983 concerning actions\n“under color of state law” applicable to Puerto Rico); Arecibo\nCmty. Health Care, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 270 F.3d 17, 21 n.3 (1st\nCir. 2001) (Puerto Rico enjoys immunity from suit to the same\nextent as any state under the Eleventh Amendment).\n\n                                      -2-\n\f           In the fall of 2003, Antonio Luis Ruiz Ramos was a\n\nstudent at the Llana Middle School in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico.                  On\n\nOctober 31, 2003, he left school around 1:40 p.m., after classes\n\nended for the day.           It was raining heavily, and much of 65th\n\nInfantry Avenue (a nearby street) and its surrounding sidewalks\n\nwere flooded by the time Antonio Luis began his walk home.\n\n           Antonio Luis was walking with a classmate, Ishell Marie\n\nDávila Villalobos.       The two decided to cross 65th Infantry Avenue\n\nand wait out the rain on the balcony of a nearby business known as\n\n“El Caporal.”     After some period of time, Antonio Luis jumped off\n\nthe balcony onto what he thought was solid ground.\n\n           Unknown      to   Antonio    Luis,   an     open    manhole    had   been\n\nobscured by the flood waters.          He fell through the opening and into\n\nthe rushing waters of a drainage pipe.            The current propelled him\n\nunderground back across 65th Infantry Avenue, and through land on\n\nwhich an auto-parts store owned by defendant Pep Boys - Manny, Moe\n\n& Jack of Puerto Rico, Inc. (“Pep Boys”) is located.                     The water\n\ncarried him to a surface drainage outlet, but discarded tires and\n\nauto parts obstructed the opening and he was trapped.\n\n           Rescuers eventually arrived, but the blockage slowed\n\ntheir   efforts    to    locate   Antonio       Luis     and    provide    medical\n\nassistance.   He suffered multiple wounds to his head and body and\n\ndrowned.\n\n           According to the complaint, various defendants were aware\n\nthat the manhole lacked a cover, that a school was nearby, and that\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthe area of 65th Infantry Avenue where the events occurred often\n\nflooded.\n\n            Antonio Luis’s mother and other persons commenced a civil\n\naction in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nPuerto Rico on April 22, 2004.     The complaint asserted claims for\n\ndamages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state tort law.             Specifically,\n\nit alleged a violation of Antonio Luis’s rights under the Fourth,\n\nFifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\n\nConstitution by six defendants:        (1) the Commonwealth; (2) DTOP;\n\n(3)   the    municipal   government      of     San   Juan,    Puerto     Rico\n\n(“Municipality”); (4) the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority\n\n(PRASA); (5) Ondeo de Puerto Rico, Inc. (“Ondeo”)2, a private\n\ncompany operating under a service contract with PRASA; and (6) the\n\nPuerto Rico Highway Authority (“PRHA”).          Plaintiffs also asserted\n\nstate-law    claims against all of the above defendants, along with\n\nPep Boys and three unnamed insurance companies.\n\n            The   Commonwealth   and     DTOP     moved   to    dismiss    on\n\njurisdictional    grounds,   asserting   immunity     under    the   Eleventh\n\nAmendment of the United States Constitution.              The Municipality\n\nmoved to dismiss contending, inter alia, that plaintiffs failed to\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      The district court appears to have assumed that Ondeo was to\nbe treated as a state actor. The parties do not challenge that\nassumption on appeal, and because it is immaterial to our ultimate\nconclusion, we do not address it.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fstate a claim upon which relief could be granted under Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 12(b)(6).3\n\n            Proceeding      in   several       stages,     the    district      court\n\ndismissed   the    entire    matter.4         On   March   2,    2005,    the   court\n\ndismissed the claims against the Commonwealth and DTOP on the basis\n\nof Eleventh Amendment immunity.               Later, the court dismissed the\n\nsection 1983 claims against the Municipality pursuant to Rule\n\n12(b)(6), on the ground that the Municipality’s conduct failed to\n\namount to a constitutional violation. The court then dismissed the\n\nclaims against PHRA and Pep Boys on grounds similar to those of the\n\nMunicipality and dismissed sua sponte the remaining claims against\n\nPRASA and Ondeo based on the same reasoning.                     With no federal\n\nclaims    remaining,     the     district      court     declined    to    exercise\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.                      The court\n\ndenied plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration. This appeal ensued.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n            A.    Standard of Review\n\n            The district court dismissed the section 1983 counts\n\nagainst   the    Commonwealth     and   DTOP       on   jurisdictional     grounds,\n\n\n\n      3\n       No federal claims were stated against Pep Boys or the three\nunnamed insurance companies. Pep Boys moved to dismiss, contending\nthat because plaintiffs failed to state a federal cause of action,\nthe district court should decline supplemental jurisdiction over\nthe state tort claims against Pep Boys.\n      4\n       The matter was referred for all purposes to the United\nStates Magistrate Judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c) and Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 73.\n\n                                        -5-\n\ffinding plaintiffs’ claims barred by the Eleventh Amendment.    The\n\nsection 1983 claims against the remaining governmental defendants\n\nand Ondeo were dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state\n\na claim.\n\n           In both instances, we review the lower court's dismissal\n\norder de novo, accepting the plaintiffs' well-pleaded facts as true\n\nand indulging all reasonable inferences therefrom.       See, e.g.,\n\nRedondo-Borges v. U.S. Dep't of Hous. & Urban Dev., 421 F.3d 1, 5\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (Rule 12(b)(6)); Arecibo Cmty. Health Care, Inc. v.\n\nPuerto Rico, 270 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 2001) (Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity).     We are not bound by the reasoning of the district\n\ncourt, and may affirm an order of dismissal on any basis made\n\napparent by the record.    See Otero v. P.R. Indus. Comm'n, 441 F.3d\n\n18, 20 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                   B.   Eleventh Amendment Immunity\n\n           The Eleventh Amendment, as construed by the Supreme\n\nCourt, bars a citizen from bringing an action in federal court\n\nagainst his or her own state.    See Bd. of Tr. of Univ. of Ala. v.\n\nGarrett,     531 U.S. 356, 363 (2001); see also Maysonet-Robles v.\n\nCabrero, 323 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing Hans v. Louisiana,\n\n134 U.S. 1, 10 (1890)).    A state, however, can waive its Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity in three ways: “(1) by a clear declaration that\n\nit intends to submit itself to the jurisdiction of a federal court\n\nor administrative proceeding; (2) by consent to or participation in\n\na federal program for which waiver of immunity is an express\n\n                                  -6-\n\fcondition; or (3) by affirmative conduct in litigation.”                         New\n\nHampshire v. Ramsey, 366 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2004) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n                Plaintiffs here claim waiver by affirmative conduct in\n\nlitigation. Essentially, they contend that: the complaint alleged\n\nthree        specific    grounds    of    waiver     of    immunity5;    that   the\n\nCommonwealth and DTOP responded to the complaint with a motion to\n\ndismiss (on grounds of Eleventh Amendment immunity) that did not\n\ndeny        those   allegations    with   sufficient      specificity;   and    that\n\ndefendants’ purported failure to do so itself constituted a waiver.\n\n                Plaintiffs’   theory      is    manifestly   incorrect,    if   not\n\nentirely frivolous.           If litigation conduct is to constitute a\n\n\n        5\n        Specifically, plaintiffs contend that the Commonwealth\nwaived immunity by (1) accepting federal funds under the Hazard\nElimination Program, 23 U.S.C. § 152, and the Highway Safety Act of\n1966, 23 U.S.C. §§ 401-11; (2) consenting to liability for injuries\ncaused by state negligence in maintaining its highways and sewers\nunder Article 404 of the Puerto Rico Political Code of 1902; and\n(3) failing to demonstrate that DTOP was an “arm of the state” and\nthus entitled to immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.\n     While plaintiffs do not argue on appeal that their purported\nwaiver grounds are substantively correct, we note the following.\nFirst, the mere receipt of federal funds does not constitute a\nwaiver of immunity. See Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 673-74\n(1974).   Second, for a state statute to constitute a waiver of\nEleventh Amendment immunity, “it must specify the State’s intention\nto subject itself to suit in federal court.”      Atascadero State\nHosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 241 (1985) (emphasis in original).\nNeither consent to be sued in state court nor a general waiver of\nsovereign immunity is sufficient. See, e.g., Fla. Dep’t of Health\n& Rehabilitative Servs. v. Fla. Nursing Home Ass’n, 450 U.S. 147,\n149-50 (1981) (consent to be sued in state court insufficient);\nAtascadero, 473 U.S. at 241 (general waiver of sovereign immunity\ninsufficient). Third, appellants subsequently conceded in their\npleadings that DTOP was an “arm of the state” for purposes of\nEleventh Amendment immunity.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fwaiver of immunity, that conduct must be “unambiguous” and “must\n\nevince    a    clear     choice      to     submit    [the      state’s]         rights   for\n\nadjudication by the federal courts.”                 Maysonet-Robles, 323 F.3d at\n\n52.    Filing a motion to dismiss that specifically asserts Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity is hardly such an act.                    E.g., Lapides v. Bd. of\n\nRegents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., 535 U.S. 613, 618-20 (2002) (removing\n\nstate action to federal court); Gardner v. New Jersey, 329 U.S.\n\n565,    574   (1947)     (filing       a    proof    of    claim       in    a    bankruptcy\n\nproceeding); Paul N. Howard Co. v. P.R. Aqueduct & Sewer Auth., 744\n\nF.2d 880, 886 (1st Cir. 1984) (filing a counterclaim and third-\n\nparty complaint in federal court).\n\n              Accordingly, we conclude that the Commonwealth and DTOP\n\ndid not waive their immunity by filing a motion to dismiss.                                The\n\ndismissal of the federal claims against the Commonwealth and DTOP\n\nis therefore affirmed.\n\n                    C.    Substantive Due Process Claims\n\n              Plaintiffs’ remaining section 1983 claims against the\n\nMunicipality, PRASA, Ondeo, and PRHA (collectively, “Governmental\n\nDefendants”)     rest     on    an    alleged       violation      of       Antonio     Luis’s\n\nsubstantive due process rights.                    The Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment forbids a state from depriving a person of\n\nlife,    liberty,        or    property       without      due     process         of     law.\n\nNotwithstanding        its     plain       language,      the    Due    Process         Clause\n\n“guarantees more than fair process,” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521\n\nU.S. 702, 719 (1997), and “cover[s] a substantive sphere as well,\n\n                                             -8-\n\fbarring certain government actions regardless of the fairness of\n\nthe procedures used to implement them.”          County of Sacramento v.\n\nLewis, 523 U.S. 833, 840 (1998) (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n          The   right   to   substantive   due    process   is,   however,\n\nconfined within relatively narrow limits.         The Supreme Court has\n\nemphasized that the Due Process Clause does not guarantee minimum\n\nlevels of safety or security.    See, e.g., Collins v. City of Harker\n\nHeights, 503 U.S. 115, 126-27 (1992).6       It has likewise observed\n\nrepeatedly that the Due Process Clause is not a substitute for\n\ntraditional tort remedies.      See, e.g., Daniels v. Williams, 474\n\nU.S. 327, 332 (1986) (“Our constitution deals with the large\n\nconcerns of the governors and the governed, but it does not purport\n\nto supplant traditional tort law in laying down rules of conduct to\n\nregulate liability for injuries that attend living together in\n\nsociety.”); Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 701 (1976) (rejecting\n\nreasoning that the Fourteenth Amendment is “a font of tort law to\n\nbe superimposed upon whatever systems may already be administered\n\nby the States”); see also Frances-Colón v. Ramirez, 107 F.3d 62,\n\n\n\n     6\n       See also DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,\n489 U.S. 189, 194-97 (1989) (holding that a state's failure to\nprotect an individual against private violence generally does not\nconstitute a violation of the Due Process Clause, because the\nClause imposes no duty on the state to provide members of the\ngeneral public with adequate protective services); Soto v. Flores,\n103 F.3d 1056, 1064 (1st Cir. 1997) (where the harm is caused by a\nthird party, “courts must be careful to distinguish between\nconventional torts and constitutional violations”).\n\n                                  -9-\n\f63-64 (1st Cir. 1997) (rejecting plaintiff’s attempt to clothe a\n\nmedical malpractice claim in civil rights language).\n\n               Plaintiffs’ claim of substantive due process here is\n\nbased on the contention that the Governmental Defendants failed to\n\ndevote sufficient resources to the design and maintenance of their\n\nsewer and highway systems, resulting in flooding and the failure to\n\ncover an open manhole.7           They did so, plaintiffs contend, despite\n\nknowing of the open manhole and of the tragic consequences that\n\ncould       arise    if   the   opening    became   obscured   by   floodwaters.\n\nPlaintiffs thus challenge the executive actions of state and local\n\nofficials.          Under such circumstances, “the threshold question is\n\nwhether the behavior of the governmental officer is so egregious,\n\nso outrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary\n\nconscience.”         Lewis, 523 U.S. at 848 n.8.\n\n               The     “shock    the   conscience”     standard     is   somewhat\n\namorphous, but determining its boundaries is not an arbitrary\n\nexercise.       See id. at 847.           The Supreme Court has stated that\n\nnegligently inflicted harm is “categorically beneath the threshold”\n\nof a constitutional violation.             Id. at 849.   In contrast, behavior\n\n“at the other end of the culpability spectrum” – that is, behavior\n\n“intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government\n\n\n        7\n       Plaintiffs allege an array of misconduct and omissions\nincluding, among other things, failure to construct and maintain\nthe sewer facilities to prevent flooding; failure to maintain the\nhighway and adjacent lands to prevent flooding; failure to\nsupervise the area around the manhole; improper use of a drainage\npump; and failure to inspect and repair the open manhole.\n\n                                          -10-\n\finterest” – is the sort of official action most likely to “shock\n\nthe conscience.”      Id.\n\n            Nothing   in     plaintiffs’       complaint     indicates   that   the\n\ndefendants actually intended to harm Antonio Luis.                     Rather, the\n\ncomplaint alleges at most that the defendants were deliberately\n\nindifferent   to    his     safety.     According       to   the   Supreme   Court,\n\nculpability in this “middle range . . . is a matter for closer\n\ncalls.”     Id.     And this court has previously noted that “[i]n\n\nsituations where actors have an opportunity to reflect and make\n\nreasoned and rational decisions, deliberately indifferent behavior\n\nmay suffice to shock the conscience.”             Rivera v. Rhode Island, 402\n\nF.3d 27, 36 (1st Cir. 2005) (emphasis added; internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).     That determination, however, is context-specific.\n\nAlthough plaintiffs suggest otherwise, \"[d]eliberate indifference\n\nthat shocks in one environment may not be so patently egregious in\n\nanother.\"    Lewis, 523 U.S. at 850.\n\n            The    Supreme    Court’s    decision       in   Collins   guides   our\n\nanalysis here.      In that case, a sanitation department worker died\n\nof asphyxiation from sewer gas while working in a manhole.                      His\n\nwidow alleged that the city was deliberately indifferent to her\n\nhusband’s safety; specifically, she contended that the city knew of\n\nthe specific dangers posed by the sewer gas, but failed to provide\n\ntraining, warnings, or proper equipment to deal with the threat.\n\n503 U.S. at 117-18.          The Court declined to characterize those\n\n“deliberately      indifferent”       omissions    as    “conscience-shocking.”\n\n                                        -11-\n\fInstead, it described the plaintiff’s complaint as “analogous to a\n\nfairly typical state-law tort claim: The city breached its duty of\n\ncare   to   [the    decedent]     by    failing       to    provide    a    safe    work\n\nenvironment.”       Id. at 128.\n\n            We find this claim, like the claim advanced in Collins,\n\nto be analogous to a typical state tort claim, and accordingly\n\ninsufficient to state a substantive due process violation.                            See\n\nFrances-Colón, 107 F.3d at 64 (“A proximate causal link between a\n\ngovernment agent’s actions and a personal injury does not, in\n\nitself, bring a case out of the realm of tort law and into the\n\ndomain of constitutional due process.”).\n\n            As     was   the   case     in    Collins,      our   unwillingness        to\n\ncharacterize     the     Governmental        Defendants’     alleged       omission    as\n\n“conscience-shocking”          “rests        on     the    presumption       that     the\n\nadministration of government programs is based on a rational\n\ndecisionmaking process that takes account of competing social,\n\npolitical, and economic forces.”                  503 U.S. at 128.      Creating and\n\nmaintaining public works such as sewers, roads, and sidewalks\n\n“involve a host of policy choices.”                Id. at 129.    Local governments\n\nmust   decide      the   appropriate         level    of   resources,       which     are\n\nnecessarily limited, to devote to those works.                        Even where the\n\ngovernment is aware of specific dangers, such as open manholes, it\n\nmust perform a triage among competing demands — a triage that is\n\noccasionally performed in times of emergency, such as heavy rains\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fand flooding.       Government actors must also determine, as a policy\n\nmatter, how to make these decisions and what resources to devote to\n\nassessing the various competing needs.             Such questions are best\n\nanswered by locally elected representatives and their appointees\n\n“rather than by federal judges interpreting the basic charter of\n\nGovernment for the entire country.”         Id.8\n\n            We emphasize that the danger at issue in this case was a\n\ndanger to the general public — not a danger that was in any\n\nmeaningful sense specific to Antonio Luis. Cf., e.g., Kallstrom v.\n\nCity of Columbus, 136 F.3d 1055, 1066 (6th Cir. 1998) (state’s\n\nactions    must     “place   the   victim    specifically      at    risk,    as\n\ndistinguished from a risk that affects the public at large”);\n\nUhlrig v. Harder, 64 F.3d 567, 574 (10th Cir. 1995) (plaintiff must\n\nbe a “member of a limited and specifically definable group”).                In\n\nsuch a context, even a conscious decision not to cover a manhole\n\nmay   be   unwise    or   unreasonable,    but   it   does   not    “shock   the\n\nconscience” as that term is defined under the law.                 See White v.\n\nLemacks, 183 F.3d 1253, 1258 (11th Cir. 1999) (“[W]hen someone not\n\nin custody is harmed because too few resources were devoted to\n\ntheir safety and protection, that harm will seldom, if ever, be\n\n\n\n      8\n       Moreover, each policy option will inevitably carry its own\nrisks — risks that will, in many cases, be well-known to the\npolicy-makers. Yet a “substantive due process violation does not\narise whenever the government’s choice prompts a known risk to come\nto pass.” Schroder v. City of Fort Thomas, 412 F.3d 724, 729 (6th\nCir. 2005).\n\n                                    -13-\n\fcognizable under the Due Process Clause.”).              State law may require\n\ndue   care    on   the   part   of   state    officials;   the   United   States\n\nConstitution does not.          Lewis, 523 U.S. at 849.\n\n              We also emphasize that the situation at bar is “quite\n\ndifferent” from that in which an individual is in state custody\n\nprior to his injury, and is therefore owed a specific duty of care\n\nby the state.      See Collins, 503 U.S. at 127; DeShaney v. Winnebago\n\nCounty Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199-200 (1989).\n\n“[W]hen the state by the affirmative exercise of its power so\n\nrestrains an individual’s liberty that it renders him unable to\n\ncare for himself,” the state may incur an “affirmative duty to\n\nprotect” the individual.             DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200 (emphasis\n\nadded).      Here, however, plaintiffs can point to no affirmative act\n\nby the state that deprived Antonio Luis of his liberty.9\n\n              Finally,   plaintiffs     assert    that   because   Puerto   Rico\n\nmaintained the sewer systems, it specifically undertook the duty to\n\nguarantee the safety of its citizens in this context.              Collins all\n\nbut forecloses such a conclusion.             The Court there found that the\n\ncity had no duty to provide its employees with a safe working\n\n      9\n       To the extent plaintiffs attempt to ground liability in the\nso-called “state-created danger” theory, the absence of an\naffirmative act by the state in creating the danger is fatal to the\nclaim.   See Rivera, 402 F.3d at 37.     The only affirmative acts\nreasonably inferred from the complaint are that the state built and\nmaintained the roadways and sewer systems. These acts are simply\ntoo attenuated from the danger at issue to meet the requirements of\nthis particular due process theory. See id.; Searles v. Se. Penn.\nTransp. Auth., 990 F.2d 789, 793 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\n                                       -14-\n\fenvironment, and indicated that a claim by a pedestrian “who\n\ninadvertently stepped into an open manhole . . . should be analyzed\n\nin a similar manner.”     Collins, 503 U.S. at 119; see also Lewellen\n\nv. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville & Davidson County, Tenn., 34 F.3d 345,\n\n350 n.4 (6th Cir. 1994) (interpreting Collins as “indicating that\n\npersons not employed by the government are . . . precluded from\n\nrecovering under § 1983 for injuries caused by the government’s\n\n‘deliberate indifference’ to a known risk” where the individual is\n\nnot in state custody); Searles, 990 F.2d at 792 (applying Collins\n\nto conclude that the state transportation agency had no duty to\n\nprovide   the   public   with   a   safe    passenger   environment   on   its\n\ntrains).10\n\n             In summary, the complaint fails to state a claim under\n\nsection 1983 for violation of substantive due process. The actions\n\nof the Governmental Defendants in failing to prevent the hazard of\n\nan open manhole cover, even if true, do not “shock the conscience”\n\nwithin the meaning of the law.\n\n\n\n\n     10\n       Plaintiffs here attempt to distinguish Collins on the ground\nthat the decedent in that case voluntarily accepted “an offer of\nemployment.” 503 U.S. at 128. In contrast, plaintiffs contend\nAntonio Luis was a minor and therefore unable to take voluntary\nactions. That distinction in this context is immaterial; it can\nhardly be said that the plaintiff in Collins knew the danger he\nfaced and voluntarily entered the manhole nonetheless. Indeed, it\nwas precisely the alleged lack of knowledge that gave rise to the\nclaim.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            Without question, the death of Antonio Luis Ruiz Ramos\n\nwas a horrific tragedy.    Nonetheless, we are required to separate\n\nour natural, and powerful, sympathy for the decedent’s family\n\nfrom our duty to apply the law.     Under that standard, the case is\n\nnot a particularly close one.     The Eleventh Amendment bars the\n\naction as to the Commonwealth and DTOP.     As to the Governmental\n\nDefendants, the complaint does not allege a violation of\n\nsubstantive due process, and therefore fails to state a claim\n\nunder section 1983 upon which relief can be granted.\n\n            Two issues remain.   First, having properly dismissed\n\nthe federal claims, the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction\n\nover the state-law claims asserted in this case.     See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1367(c)(3); see also Martinez v. Colon, 54 F.3d 980, 990-91 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).    Second, because we affirm the decision of the\n\ndistrict court on the merits, we find no abuse of discretion in\n\nits refusal to grant plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration.\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f",

Because we find that (1) the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\"Commonwealth\") and the Commonwealth Department of Transportation and Public Works (referred to in the pleadings by its Spanish-language acronym \"DTOP\") did not waive their Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit and (2) plaintiffs' claims against the remaining governmental defendants do not rise to the level of a federal constitutional violation, we affirm the dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court disposed of this case on motions to dismiss, we assume the truth of the facts set forth in the amended complaint. <i>See Redondo-Borges v. U.S. Dep't. of Housing and Urban Dev.,</i> 421 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fall of 2003, Antonio Luis Ruiz Ramos was a student at the Llana Middle School in R&#237;o Piedras, Puerto Rico. On October 31, 2003, he left school around 1:40 p.m., after classes ended for the day. It was raining heavily, and much of 65th Infantry Avenue (a nearby street) and its surrounding sidewalks were flooded by the time Antonio Luis began his walk home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Antonio Luis was walking with a classmate, Ishell Marie D&#225;vila Villalobos. The two decided to cross 65th Infantry Avenue and wait out the rain on the balcony of a nearby business known as \"El Caporal.\" After some period of time, Antonio Luis jumped off the balcony onto what he thought was solid ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unknown to Antonio Luis, an open manhole had been obscured by the flood waters. He fell through the opening and into the rushing waters of a drainage pipe. The current propelled him underground back across 65th Infantry Avenue, and through land on which an auto-parts store owned by defendant Pep Boys &#8212; Manny, Moe &amp; Jack of Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Pep Boys\") is located. The water carried him to a surface drainage outlet, but discarded tires and auto parts obstructed the opening and he was trapped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rescuers eventually arrived, but the blockage slowed their efforts to locate Antonio Luis and provide medical assistance. He suffered multiple wounds to his head and body and drowned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the complaint, various defendants were aware that the manhole lacked a cover, that a school was nearby, and that the area of 65th Infantry Avenue where the events occurred often flooded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Antonio Luis's mother and other persons commenced a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico on April 22, 2004. The complaint asserted claims for damages under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and state tort law. Specifically, it alleged a violation of Antonio Luis's rights under the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution by six defendants: (1) the Commonwealth; (2) DTOP; (3) the municipal government of San Juan, Puerto Rico (\"Municipality\"); (4) the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA); (5) Ondeo de Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Ondeo\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>, a private company operating under a service contract with PRASA; and (6) the Puerto Rico Highway Authority (\"PRHA\"). Plaintiffs also asserted state-law claims against all of the above defendants, along with Pep Boys and three unnamed insurance companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth and DTOP moved to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds, asserting immunity under the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution. The Municipality moved to dismiss contending, <i>inter alia,</i> that plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proceeding in several stages, the district court dismissed the entire matter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> On March 2, 2005, the court dismissed the claims against the Commonwealth and DTOP on the basis of Eleventh Amendment immunity. Later, the court dismissed the section 1983 claims against the Municipality pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), on the ground that the Municipality's conduct failed to amount to a constitutional violation. The court then dismissed the claims against PHRA and Pep Boys on grounds similar to those of the Municipality and dismissed <i>sua sponte</i> the remaining claims against PRASA and Ondeo based on the same reasoning. With no federal claims remaining, the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims. The court denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the section 1983 counts against the Commonwealth and DTOP on jurisdictional grounds, finding plaintiffs' claims barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The section 1983 claims against the remaining governmental defendants and Ondeo were dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In both instances, we review the lower court's dismissal order <i>de novo,</i> accepting the plaintiffs' well-pleaded facts as true and indulging all reasonable inferences therefrom. <i>See, e.g., Redondo-Borges v. U.S. Dep't of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev.,</i> 421 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2005) (Rule 12(b)(6)); <i>Arecibo Cmty. Health Care, Inc. v. Puerto Rico,</i> 270 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 2001) (Eleventh Amendment immunity). We are not bound by the reasoning of the district court, and may affirm an order of dismissal on any basis made apparent by the record. <i>See Otero v. P.R. Indus. Comm'n,</i> 441 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Eleventh Amendment Immunity</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Amendment, as construed by the Supreme Court, bars a citizen from bringing an action in federal court against his or her own state. <i>See Bd. of Tr. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,</i> 531 U.S. 356, 363, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001); <i>see also Maysonet-Robles v. Cabrero,</i> 323 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir.2003) (citing <i>Hans v. Louisiana,</i> 134 U.S. 1, 10, 10 S.Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890)). A state, however, can waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity in three ways: \"(1) by a clear declaration that it intends to submit itself to the jurisdiction of a federal court or administrative proceeding; (2) by consent to or participation in a federal program for which waiver of immunity is an express condition; or (3) by affirmative conduct in litigation.\" <i>New Hampshire v. Ramsey,</i> 366 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir.2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs here claim waiver by affirmative conduct in litigation. Essentially, they contend that: the complaint alleged three specific grounds of waiver of immunity<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>; that the Commonwealth and DTOP responded to the complaint with a motion to dismiss (on grounds of Eleventh Amendment immunity) that did not deny those allegations with sufficient specificity; and that defendants' purported failure to do so itself constituted a waiver. Plaintiffs' theory is manifestly incorrect, if not entirely frivolous. If litigation conduct is to constitute a waiver of immunity, that conduct must be \"unambiguous\" and \"must evince a clear choice to submit [the state's] rights for adjudication by the federal courts.\" <i>Maysonet-Robles,</i> 323 F.3d at 52. Filing a motion to dismiss that specifically asserts Eleventh Amendment immunity is hardly such an act. <i>E.g., Lapides v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Ga.,</i> 535 U.S. 613, 618-20, 122 S.Ct. 1640, 152 L.Ed.2d 806 (2002) (removing state action to federal court); <i>Gardner v. New Jersey,</i> 329 U.S. 565, 574, 67 S.Ct. 467, 91 L.Ed. 504 (1947) (filing a proof of claim in a bankruptcy proceeding); <i>Paul N. Howard Co. v. P.R. Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth.,</i> 744 F.2d 880, 886 (1st Cir.1984) (filing a counterclaim and third-party complaint in federal court).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Commonwealth and DTOP did not waive their immunity by filing a motion to dismiss. The dismissal of the federal claims against the Commonwealth and DTOP is therefore affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Substantive Due Process Claims</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' remaining section 1983 claims against the Municipality, PRASA, Ondeo, and PRHA (collectively, \"Governmental Defendants\") rest on an alleged violation of Antonio Luis's substantive due process rights. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids a state from depriving a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Notwithstanding its plain language, the Due Process Clause \"guarantees more than fair process,\" <i>Washington v. Glucksberg,</i> 521 U.S. 702, 719, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997), and \"cover[s] a substantive sphere as well, barring certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\" <i>County of Sacramento v. Lewis,</i> 523 U.S. 833, 840, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right to substantive due process is, however, confined within relatively narrow limits. The Supreme Court has emphasized that the Due Process Clause does not guarantee minimum levels of safety or security. <i>See, e.g., Collins v. City of Harker Heights,</i> 503 U.S. 115, 126-27, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> It has likewise observed repeatedly that the Due Process Clause is not a substitute for traditional tort remedies. <i>See, e.g., Daniels v.

Plaintiffs thus challenge the executive actions of state and local officials. Under such circumstances, \"the threshold question is whether the behavior of the governmental officer is so egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.\" Lewis, 523 U.S. at 848 n. 8, 118 S.Ct. 1708.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"shock the conscience\" standard is somewhat amorphous, but determining its boundaries is not an arbitrary exercise. <i>See id.</i> at 847. The Supreme Court has stated that negligently inflicted harm is \"categorically beneath the threshold\" of a constitutional violation. <i>Id.</i> at 849. In contrast, behavior \"at the other end of the culpability spectrum\" &#8212; that is, behavior \"intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest\" &#8212; is the sort of official action most likely to \"shock the conscience.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in plaintiffs' complaint indicates that the defendants actually intended to harm Antonio Luis. Rather, the complaint alleges at most that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his safety. According to the Supreme Court, culpability in this \"middle range ... is a matter for closer calls.\" <i>Id.</i> And this court has previously noted that \"[i]n situations where actors have an opportunity to reflect and make reasoned and rational decisions, deliberately indifferent behavior <i>may</i> suffice to shock the conscience.\" <i>Rivera v. Rhode Island,</i> 402 F.3d 27, 36 (1st Cir.2005) (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). That determination, however, is context-specific. Although plaintiffs suggest otherwise, \"[d]eliberate indifference that shocks in one environment may not be so patently egregious in another.\" <i>Lewis,</i> 523 U.S. at 850, 118 S.Ct. 1708.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court's decision in <i>Collins</i> guides our analysis here. In that case, a sanitation department worker died of asphyxiation from sewer gas while working in a manhole. His widow alleged that the city was deliberately indifferent to her husband's safety; specifically, she contended that the city knew of the specific dangers posed by the sewer gas, but failed to provide training, warnings, or proper equipment to deal with the threat. 503 U.S. at 117-18, 112 S.Ct. 1061. The Court declined to characterize those \"deliberately indifferent\" omissions as \"conscience-shocking.\" Instead, it described the plaintiff's complaint as \"analogous to a fairly typical state-law tort claim: The city breached its duty of care to [the decedent] by failing to provide a safe work environment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 128.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find this claim, like the claim advanced in <i>Collins,</i> to be analogous to a typical state tort claim, and accordingly insufficient to state a substantive due process violation. <i>See Frances-Col&#243;n,</i> 107 F.3d at 64 (\"A proximate causal link between a government agent's actions and a personal injury does not, in itself, bring a case out of the realm of tort law and into the domain of constitutional due process.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As was the case in <i>Collins,</i> our unwillingness to characterize the Governmental Defendants' alleged omission as \"conscience-shocking\" \"rests on the presumption that the administration of government programs is based on a rational decisionmaking process that takes account of competing social, political, and economic forces.\" 503 U.S. at 128, 112 S.Ct. 1061. Creating and maintaining public works such as sewers, roads, and sidewalks \"involve a host of policy choices.\" <i>Id.</i> at 129, 112 S.Ct. 1061. Local governments must decide the appropriate level of resources, which are necessarily limited, to devote to those works. Even where the government is aware of specific dangers, such as open manholes, it must perform a triage among competing demands &#8212; a triage that is occasionally performed in times of emergency, such as heavy rains and flooding. Government actors must also determine, as a policy matter, how to make these decisions and what resources to devote to assessing the various competing needs. Such questions are best answered by locally elected representatives and their appointees \"rather than by federal judges interpreting the basic charter of Government for the entire country.\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasize that the danger at issue in this case was a danger to the general public &#8212; not a danger that was in any meaningful sense specific to Antonio Luis. <i>Cf., e.g., Kallstrom v. City of Columbus,</i> 136 F.3d 1055, 1066 (6th Cir.1998) (state's actions must \"place the victim specifically at risk, as distinguished from a risk that affects the public at large\"); <i>Uhlrig v. Harder,</i> 64 F.3d 567, 574 (10th Cir.1995) (plaintiff must be a \"member of a limited and specifically definable group\"). In such a context, even a conscious decision not to cover a manhole may be unwise or unreasonable, but it does not \"shock the conscience\" as that term is defined under the law. <i>See White v. Lemacks,</i> 183 F.3d 1253, 1258 (11th Cir.1999) (\"[W]hen someone not in custody is harmed because too few resources were devoted to their safety and protection, that harm will seldom, if ever, be cognizable under the Due Process Clause.\"). State law may require due care on the part of state officials; the United States Constitution does not. <i>Lewis,</i> 523 U.S. at 849, 118 S.Ct. 1708.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also emphasize that the situation at bar is \"quite different\" from that in which an individual is in state custody prior to his injury, and is therefore owed a specific duty of care by the state. <i>See Collins,</i> 503 U.S. at 127, 112 S.Ct. 1061; <i>DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,</i> 489 U.S. 189, 199-200, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989). \"[W]hen the state by the <i>affirmative exercise of its power</i> so restrains an individual's liberty that it renders him unable to care for himself,\" the state may incur an \"affirmative duty to protect\" the individual. <i>DeShaney,</i> 489 U.S. at 200, 109 S.Ct. 998 (emphasis added). Here, however, plaintiffs can point to no affirmative act by the state that deprived Antonio Luis of his liberty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs assert that because Puerto Rico maintained the sewer systems, it specifically undertook the duty to guarantee the safety of its citizens in this context. <i>Collins</i> all but forecloses such a conclusion. The Court there found that the city had no duty to provide its employees with a safe working environment, and indicated that a claim by a pedestrian \"who inadvertently stepped into an open manhole ... should be analyzed in a similar manner.\" <i>Collins,</i> 503 U.S. at 119, 112 S.Ct. 1061; <i>see also Lewellen v. Metro. Gov't of Nashville &amp; Davidson County, Tenn.,</i> 34 F.3d 345, 350 n. 4 (6th Cir.1994) (interpreting <i>Collins</i> as \"indicating that persons not employed by the government are ... precluded from recovering under &#167; 1983 for injuries caused by the government's `deliberate indifference' to a known risk\" where the individual is not in state custody); <i>Searles,</i> 990 F.2d at 792 (applying <i>Collins</i> to conclude that the state transportation agency had no duty to provide the public with a safe passenger environment on its trains).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, the complaint fails to state a claim under section 1983 for violation of substantive due process. The actions of the Governmental Defendants in failing to prevent the hazard of an open manhole cover, even if true, do not \"shock the conscience\" within the meaning of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without question, the death of Antonio Luis Ruiz Ramos was a horrific tragedy. Nonetheless, we are required to separate our natural, and powerful, sympathy for the decedent's family from our duty to apply the law. Under that standard, the case is not a particularly close one. The Eleventh Amendment bars the action as to the Commonwealth and DTOP. As to the Governmental Defendants, the complaint does not allege a violation of substantive due process, and therefore fails to state a claim under section 1983 upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two issues remain. First, having properly dismissed the federal claims, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims asserted in this case. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c)(3); <i>see also Martinez v. Colon,</i> 54 F.3d 980, 990-91 (1st Cir.1995). Second, because we affirm the decision of the district court on the merits, we find no abuse of discretion in its refusal to grant plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For all relevant purposes in this opinion, Puerto Rico is treated as a state<i>See, e.g., Soto v.

First, the mere receipt of federal funds does not constitute a waiver of immunity. <i>See Edelman v. Jordan,</i> 415 U.S. 651, 673-74, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). Second, for a state statute to constitute a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity, \"it must specify the State's intention to subject itself to suit in <i>federal court.</i>\" <i>Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon,</i> 473 U.S. 234, 241, 105 S.Ct. 3142, 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985) (emphasis in original). Neither consent to be sued in state court nor a general waiver of sovereign immunity is sufficient. <i>See, e.g., Fla. Dep't of Health &amp; Rehabilitative Servs. v. Fla.

CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without question, the death of Antonio Luis Ruiz Ramos was a horrific tragedy. Nonetheless, we are required to separate our natural, and powerful, sympathy for the decedent's family from our duty to apply the law. Under that standard, the case is not a particularly close one. The Eleventh Amendment bars the action as to the Commonwealth and DTOP. As to the Governmental Defendants, the complaint does not allege a violation of substantive due process, and therefore fails to state a claim under section 1983 upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two issues remain. First, having properly dismissed the federal claims, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims asserted in this case. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c)(3); <i>see also Martinez v.

First, the mere receipt of federal funds does not constitute a waiver of immunity. <i>See Edelman v.

Second, for a state statute to constitute a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity, \"it must specify the State's intention to subject itself to suit in <i>federal court.</i>\" <i>Atascadero State Hosp. v.
