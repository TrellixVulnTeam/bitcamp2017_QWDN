Daniel R.

Garcia, United States Attorney, Sonia I. Torres-Pabón,\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              July 22, 2004\n\f       Per Curiam.      In this bail appeal, defendant José Valdivia\n\nclaims that the district court erred in ordering him detained\n\nwithout bail.        \"[U]pon careful review of all the facts and the\n\ntrial judge's reasons,\" United States v. O'Brien, 895 F.2d 810, 814\n\n(1st   Cir.   1990),    \"tempered   by   a   degree    of    deference    to   the\n\ndeterminations made below,\" United States v. Tortura, 922 F.2d 880,\n\n882-83 (1st Cir. 1990), we find no basis to conclude that \"a\n\ndifferent result should have been reached.\"                O'Brien, 895 F.2d at\n\n814.    Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n       Where, as here, there is probable clause to believe that the\n\ndefendant committed certain drug offenses carrying a minimum prison\n\nterm of ten years or more, Congress has established a rebuttable\n\npresumption \"that no condition or combination of conditions will\n\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required\" if\n\ndefendant     is    released   pending   trial.       18    U.S.C.   §   3142(e),\n\n(f)(1)(C).         Congress based that presumption on findings that\n\n\"'flight to avoid prosecution is particularly high among persons\n\ncharged with major drug offenses'\" and that \"'drug traffickers\n\noften have established ties outside the United States . . . [and]\n\nhave both the resources and foreign contacts to escape to other\n\ncountries.'\" United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 384 (1st Cir.\n\n1985)(quoting S. Rep. No. 225, at 20 (1983), reprinted in 1984\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 1, 23).\n\n       \"[T]o 'rebut' the presumption, the defendant must produce some\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fevidence . . . that what is true in general is not true in the\n\n[defendant's] particular case.\"          Jessup, 757 F.2d at 384.           But,\n\neven if the defendant produces sufficient evidence to rebut the\n\npresumption, \"the magistrate or judge should then still keep in\n\nmind the fact that Congress has found that [drug] offenders, as a\n\ngeneral rule, pose special risks of flight . . . [and] should\n\nincorporate that fact and finding among the other special factors\n\nthat Congress has told [judges] to weigh when making . . . bail\n\ndecision[s].\"    Jessup, 757 F.2d at 384.         The amount of weight to be\n\ngiven to the presumption depends on how closely the defendant's\n\ncase    \"resemble[s]   the   congressional       paradigm.\"      Id.   at   387.\n\nRegardless of whether the presumption is rebutted, the burden of\n\nproof remains on the government.             Id. at 381.\n\n       Here, the evidence produced and proffered by Valdivia focused\n\non his strong family ties, his steady and gainful employment\n\nhistory, his good reputation in the community, and his relatives'\n\nwillingness to take custody of him and help finance his bail.                 We\n\nneed not decide whether that evidence was sufficient to rebut the\n\npresumption, because, as discussed below, the district court's\n\ncareful application of the statutory factors to the particular\n\nfacts    of   this   case    readily    withstands     scrutiny    under     the\n\nintermediate standard of review applicable here.              See Tortura, 922\n\nF.2d at 883.\n\n       In concluding that Valdivia presented a high risk of flight,\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fthe district court appropriately gave considerable weight to the\n\npresumption and the underlying congressional findings because, as\n\nthe judge concluded, \"the particular facts surrounding [Valdivia]\n\nprecisely fit the Congressional concerns of enhanced flight risk.\"\n\nIn particular, the evidence proffered by the government, that\n\nValdivia was part of a large organization to import and distribute\n\n60 to 80 kilograms of heroin moved during the three-year time span\n\nof the conspiracy, is sufficient to characterize this offense as\n\nthe kind of \"major drug offense\" that the presumption was designed\n\nto address.   As the district court further found, Valdivia was \"a\n\nmain cog\" in that operation:   He recruited crew members of cruise\n\nships or other couriers to carry the drugs into Puerto Rico, he\n\nreceived the drugs when they arrived, and he coordinated the\n\nfurther distribution of the drugs to the United States.        The\n\nevidence that Valdivia had strong connections at the Puerto Rico\n\nPort Authority, where he worked; at the international airport; and\n\nin foreign countries, including Aruba and Venezuela, where other\n\nmembers of his drug organization had previously fled, also fit the\n\ncongressional paradigm of a \"drug trafficker[] [who] ha[s] . . .\n\nestablished ties outside the United States . . . [and] ha[s] both\n\nthe resources and foreign contacts to escape to other countries.\"\n\nAs the district court concluded, \"a conspiracy to move sixty to\n\neighty kilos of heroin undetected through major ports and airports,\n\nevading security, . . . qualifies as [a] major drug operation\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fcapable of expeditiously moving defendant out of the jurisdiction.\"\n\n       In addition to the presumption itself, the district court also\n\nappropriately relied on the strength of the evidence against\n\nValdivia.      See United States v. Palmer-Contreras, 835 F.2d 15, 18\n\n(1st   Cir.    1987)       (per    curiam)   (where    \"the      evidence    against\n\ndefendant[] is strong, the incentive for relocation is increased\").\n\nThat evidence included proffered testimony of two cooperating\n\ncoconspirators as to Valdivia's role in the operation, a proffered\n\nvideo recording of Valdivia meeting with two persons who arrive to\n\ncollect       money    from       drug   activities,       and   taped      telephone\n\nconversations identifying Valdivia as a person having the financial\n\nresources to pay for drug operations and knowing the whereabouts of\n\na courier and of missing heroin.                Based primarily on that strong\n\nevidence of guilt, coupled with the presumption, the district court\n\ncorrectly concluded that Valdivia presented a high risk of flight.\n\n       The evidence also warranted the district court's further\n\nconclusion that the conditions proposed by Valdivia ($8,000 bail\n\nand    oversight      by    his    relatives)1     would    be    insufficient     to\n\n\"reasonably assure [his] presence\" at trial.                 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e).\n\nGiven the evidence of Valdivia's own financial resources and his\n\nmembership in a large drug organization, the court correctly\n\n\n\n       1\n      The alternative conditions recommended by pretrial services\nwere based solely on Valdivia's past history and therefore did not\ntake into account the facts of the offense, the strength of the\nevidence against him, or the statutory presumption.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fconcluded that the risk of losing $8,000 would not be sufficient to\n\nprevent Valdivia from fleeing.    For major drug traffickers, \"even\n\na large bond may be just a cost of doing business.\"         Palmer-\n\nContreras, 835 F.2d at 17.   Nor was it reasonable to believe that\n\nValdivia's family would be able to prevent him from fleeing, given\n\nhis strong connections at the ports and the airport and in foreign\n\ncountries and his strong motivation to flee.2\n\n     In sum, based on the presumption and the statutory factors\n\nas applied to the particular facts of this case, we find no\n\nreason to conclude that \"a different result should have been\n\nreached\" by the district court.3       Accordingly, the district\n\ncourt's decision is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Because we find that the district court correctly concluded\nthat Valdivia presented a risk of flight that could not be avoided\nby imposing the conditions Valdivia proposed, we need not reach the\nquestion of whether his release would also impose an unavoidable\nrisk of danger to the community.\n     3\n      To the extent that Valdivia challenges the constitutionality\nof the district court's decision, that argument is foreclosed by\nthe district court's correct conclusion that denial of bail was\nnecessary to prevent Valdivia's flight. Where, as here, the risk\nof flight is unusually high, there is no constitutional right to\nbail. United States v. Acevedo-Ramos, 755 F.2d 203, 206 (1st Cir.\n1985).\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",
