D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                          Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                    Baldock,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Robert W.

Plaintiff Anna Leavitt\n\nbrought   suit   against   her   former   employer,   Defendant   Wal-Mart\n\nStores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”), alleging discrimination in violation of\n\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 -\n\n12213 (2000), and Maine state law.           Leavitt claimed she is a\n\nqualified person with a disability as defined by the ADA and that\n\nWal-Mart failed to reasonably accommodate her disability leading to\n\nher constructive discharge. On cross-motions for summary judgment,\n\nthe district court concluded the treatment Leavitt alleged was not\n\nsufficiently severe to establish a constructive discharge.             The\n\ncourt also concluded Leavitt was not seeking damages apart from her\n\nconstructive discharge claim.         Accordingly, the court entered\n\njudgment in favor of Wal-Mart on her discrimination claims.1\n\n           Plaintiff appeals, asserting (1) the district erred in\n\ngranting Wal-Mart summary judgment on her constructive discharge\n\nclaim; and (2) the court erred in failing to address her claim that\n\nWal-Mart discriminated against her by failing to provide reasonable\n\naccommodations.2    We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n\n\n     1\n      Leavitt also filed a claim seeking damages for intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress.     The district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of Wal-Mart on this claim after\nconcluding the treatment Leavitt alleged was not sufficiently\nextreme or outrageous to permit recovery. Leavitt does not appeal\nthis ruling.\n     2\n      In the interest of judicial economy, it may have been\npreferable for Leavitt to bring this alleged error to the attention\nof the district court by filing a Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) or a Motion for Relief from\n\n                                    -2-\n\f1291.   We affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment on\n\nLeavitt’s     constructive    discharge         claim,   but    remand   for\n\nconsideration of Leavitt’s reasonable accommodation claim.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            Leavitt worked at the Wal-Mart store in Falmouth, Maine\n\nfrom approximately August 7, 1998 to May 10, 2000.             Shortly after\n\nshe began her employment, Wal-Mart promoted Leavitt from a sales\n\nassociate’s position to a management position in its in-store\n\nrestaurant.     Store records indicate Leavitt received positive\n\nperformance     evaluations    and        was    performing     all   duties\n\nsatisfactorily.    In March 1999, Leavitt suffered a heart attack.\n\n            Leavitt asserts she became disabled within the meaning of\n\nthe ADA due to health problems associated with the heart attack.\n\nAs a result of these health problems, Leavitt has difficulty\n\nbreathing and walking and suffers from increased fatigue and\n\noccasional panic attacks. On several occasions, Leavitt’s physical\n\ncondition required her to seek medical attention.              As a result,\n\nLeavitt’s treating physician documented her condition and placed\n\nrestrictions on her work, including limits on both the hours she\n\n\n\n\nJudgment pursuant to Rule 60. But, as Wal-Mart properly conceded\nat oral argument, there is nothing in either the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure or the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure that\nmandate this approach. Following the district court’s entry of\nfinal judgment purporting to dispose of all claims, this court had\njurisdiction over Leavitt’s claim.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fcan work and the amount of weight she can lift.                Leavitt provided\n\nthis documentation to Wal-Mart.\n\n            Upon   Leavitt’s    return       to   work,    Wal-Mart    management\n\nproposed to transfer her from her former position to a position\n\nthat would require less physical exertion.                 After observing that\n\nLeavitt still struggled to perform her duties, management proposed\n\na second transfer to a position that required even less physical\n\nexertion.    Both transfers occurred after discussions with Leavitt\n\nand with her consent.       Wal-Mart management viewed the transfers as\n\nan   accommodation    for    Leavitt’s       medical      condition.       Despite\n\ntransferring    Leavitt     from   a   management         position    to   a   sales\n\nassociate position, Wal-Mart did not reduce her hourly wage.\n\n            Before her heart attack, Leavitt primarily worked the day\n\nshift, but covered the evening shift on occasion.                    When Leavitt\n\ntransferred to the new positions, her schedule changed such that\n\nshe was working almost exclusively evening shifts. Leavitt was led\n\nto believe this change would be temporary, but after several months\n\nshe saw no indication Wal-Mart was attempting to find another\n\nemployee to cover the evening shifts.                Leavitt asserts working\n\nevening shifts increased her fatigue, which in turn exacerbated her\n\nbreathing and walking problems.          Leavitt made several requests to\n\nvarious members of the management team in an effort to have her\n\nschedule changed.     Wal-Mart did not accommodate these requests.\n\nThere is some evidence Leavitt was led to believe she would not be\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fscheduled to work at all if she insisted on only working day\n\nshifts.\n\n            Leavitt lives in Casco, Maine and, after her heart\n\nattack,    found    the     lengthy   commute       to   Falmouth     increased   her\n\nfatigue.       She informed Wal-Mart management she would like to\n\ntransfer to a Wal-Mart store located in Windham, Maine, which was\n\nsignificantly closer to her home.                   The Falmouth store manager\n\nencouraged Leavitt to investigate openings at the Windham store,\n\nbut when she informed him of openings took no action to initiate a\n\ntransfer.\n\n            Leavitt       also   asserts      she    experienced      some   hostile\n\nreactions    to    her    disability.       Several       evening-shift      managers\n\nrepeatedly confronted Leavitt as she left work, demanding to know\n\nwhy she was able to leave early.                 These confrontations occurred\n\ndespite documentation in her work file limiting her shifts to six\n\nhours.      Wal-Mart also would not permit Leavitt to park in a\n\nhandicapped spot until she obtained a handicapped parking permit.\n\nAfter obtaining the permit, Leavitt endured comments that she\n\nwasn’t really handicapped and that she must feel entitled to\n\nspecial treatment.          Leavitt also asserts her direct supervisor\n\nasked her to work hours and perform duties beyond those permitted\n\nby her documented medical restrictions.                  These requests continued\n\neven   after      Leavitt    informed      the      supervisor   of    her    medical\n\ncondition.\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f              Finally, in late April, Leavitt received notice of a\n\nschedule change that allowed her to work two day shifts over the\n\nnext three-week period.         She verified the schedule change with the\n\nstore   manager.        But   Leavitt’s    direct    supervisor   subsequently\n\nassigned the day shifts to another employee once again leaving\n\nLeavitt   with     only   evening    shifts.        Leavitt   confronted      the\n\nsupervisor about the schedule change, but the supervisor made it\n\nclear the change would stand. After discussing the matter with her\n\nsupervisor, Leavitt believed Wal-Mart would fire her if she did not\n\ncomply with the change.         She also discovered that her day shifts\n\nhad been assigned to a new, non-disabled employee.                The schedule\n\nchange directly conflicts with Wal-Mart’s stated scheduling policy,\n\nwhich reserves coveted day-time shifts for employees with more\n\nseniority and requires a manager to consult with an employee prior\n\nto implementing a schedule change.\n\n              Frustrated with Wal-Mart’s refusal to accommodate her\n\nrequests for a schedule change or a store transfer, and frustrated\n\nwith    her   supervisor’s      failure     to    comply   with   store   policy\n\nconcerning scheduling, Leavitt terminated her employment with Wal-\n\nMart.\n\n                                      II.\n\n              Leavitt   first    asserts    the    district   court   erred    in\n\ngranting summary judgment on her constructive discharge claim.                 We\n\nreview de novo the district court’s grant of summary judgment,\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fviewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light\n\nmost favorable to the non-moving party.     See Gonzalez v. El Dia,\n\nInc., 304 F.3d 63, 68 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          Constructive discharge is a label for “treatment so\n\nhostile or degrading that no reasonable employee would tolerate\n\ncontinuing in the position.”   Mesendez-Arroyo v. Cutler-Hammer de\n\nP.R. Co., 273 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir. 2001).          The standard is an\n\nobjective one: the conditions must be so difficult or unpleasant\n\nthat a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s shoes would have felt\n\ncompelled to resign.    Marrera v. Goya of Puerto Rico, Inc., 304\n\nF.3d 7, 28 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing Suarez v. Pueblo Int’l, Inc.,\n\n229 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir. 2000) (additional citation omitted)).\n\nProperly applied, this standard “does not guarantee a workplace\n\nfree of the usual ebb and flow of power relations and inter-office\n\npolitics.” Suarez, 229 F.3d at 54.       Rather, the plaintiff must\n\nestablish that “working conditions were so unpleasant that staying\n\non the job while seeking redress would have been intolerable.”\n\nMarrera, 304 F.3d at 28 (quoting Keeler v. Putnam Fid. Trust Co.,\n\n238 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2001) (internal quotations omitted)).\n\n          A constructive discharge can arise from, among other\n\nthings,   “reassignment    with     significantly     diminished   job\n\nresponsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in\n\nbenefits.”    See Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742,\n\n761 (1998).   However, a reduction in responsibility, unaccompanied\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fby a diminution in salary or some other marked lessening of the\n\nquality of working conditions, does not constitute a constructive\n\ndischarge.     See Suarez, 229 F.3d at 55.\n\n             There   is   no   evidence    Leavitt’s   job   transfers   were\n\nanything other than a desired accommodation of her health problems.\n\nLeavitt also does not claim Wal-Mart reduced her hours or her\n\nhourly wage.     Leavitt’s only complaints, that Wal-Mart failed to\n\naccommodate her requests for a transfer and for more day shifts,\n\nand failed to follow policy in awarding day shifts, are not so\n\nsevere and did not produce working conditions so unpleasant that\n\nstaying on the job would have been intolerable.              Leavitt did not\n\nproduce any evidence that working evening shifts and commuting to\n\nFalmouth had a dramatic impact on her health conditions or that she\n\nwas unable to continue her work.           Accordingly, the district court\n\ndid not err in granting summary judgment on this claim.\n\n                                    III.\n\n             Leavitt next asserts the district court erred in failing\n\nto consider her reasonable accommodation claim.              After resolving\n\nthe constructive discharge claim, the district court stated:\n\n     Since Leavitt has made clear that in this lawsuit she is\n     not claiming damages for her treatment apart from the\n     constructive discharge, I grant summary judgment to the\n     defendant on [both discrimination counts].\n\nLeavitt v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 238 F. Supp. 2d 313, 316 (D. Me.\n\n2003 (footnote omitted).         The court based this conclusion on a\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\ffootnote in   Leavitt’s   reply   brief   to   her   motion    for   summary\n\njudgment.   Id. at 316 n.2.   In that footnote, Leavitt noted:\n\n     Defendant has moved for summary judgment, or to dismiss,\n     a “claim” that Plaintiff never raised; that the\n     disability-based harassment she endured at the hands of\n     Defendant’s management entitles her to damages under the\n     ADA or MHRA. This was not Plaintiff’s claim; Plaintiff\n     mentioned the incidents in her Statement of Material\n     Facts Not in Dispute in order to show inter alia,\n     Defendant’s awareness of Plaintiff’s disability and\n     resulting restrictions; the stress and frustration this\n     caused Plaintiff and as direct and circumstantial\n     evidence of Defendant’s discriminatory animus towards her\n     based on her disability.\n\n\nAppendix at 214-15(italics in original, citations omitted).             This\n\nfootnote appeared in response to Wal-Mart’s brief in opposition to\n\nplaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment.          In that brief,\n\nWal-Mart argued:\n\n     It also appears that the Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial\n     Summary Judgment, for the first time, alleges that\n     Defendant engaged in disability based harassment by Wal-\n     Mart management. However, nowhere in Plaintiff’s initial\n     Complaint was there an allegation (or inference) that the\n     Plaintiff was the subject of disability based harassment.\n     At the outset, therefore, Defendant requests the Court to\n     dismiss this claim....”\n\nAppendix at 200 (citations and emphasis omitted).             In support of\n\nthe district court’s grant of summary judgment, Wal-Mart argues\n\nboth that Leavitt failed to raise a reasonable accommodation claim\n\nin the proceedings before the district court and that, even if\n\nraised, the district court correctly concluded Leavitt expressly\n\nwaived the claim based on the referenced footnote.\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f            Leavitt raised the claim in both her pleadings and motion\n\nbriefs.     In   her   complaint,    Leavitt   clearly   pled    failure   to\n\naccommodate as a ground for recovery.             In Count I, Plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaint     asserts     Wal-Mart      engaged     in   disability-based\n\ndiscrimination in violation of the ADA.            This Count raises two\n\ndistinct theories of recovery under the ADA: a claim that Wal-Mart\n\nfailed to provide reasonable accommodation and a claim that this\n\nfailure lead to Plaintiff’s constructive discharge.             Paragraph 29\n\nof the Complaint states:\n\n     Wal-Mart failed to provide Plaintiff with a reasonable\n     accommodation because of her disability.      The record\n     establishes that Plaintiff is an otherwise qualified\n     individual with a disability, entitled to reasonable\n     accommodations to her known physical limitations.\n     Plaintiff sought these reasonable accommodations – being\n     assigned to the Fitting Department, having her shifts\n     occur during the day and a transfer to a location closer\n     to her home. Wal-Mart refused to take these simple steps\n     to   accommodate  Plaintiff   solely   because   of  her\n     disability.\n\nAppendix at 11.         This paragraph states a claim separate and\n\ndistinct from Leavitt’s constructive discharge claim, which appears\n\nin Paragraph 28 of the Complaint.\n\n            Plaintiff also performed discovery on the reasonable\n\naccommodation claim, and dedicated a section of her Statement of\n\nMaterial Facts to this claim.        See Appendix at 33 (Section titled\n\n“Wal-Mart Refuses to Reasonably Accommodate Plaintiff’s Requests to\n\neither be Rescheduled to the Day Shift in Falmouth, or to be\n\nTransferred to its Windham Store”).            Plaintiff also raised the\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fissue in her motion for partial summary judgment by seeking summary\n\njudgment on Wal-Mart’s affirmative defense that it had provided\n\nreasonable accommodations.          Appendix at 125.\n\n              Defendant clearly was on notice of Leavitt’s reasonable\n\naccommodation claim.          In its motion for summary judgment, Wal-Mart\n\ndescribes Count I of Leavitt’s Complaint as asserting both a\n\nfailure to accommodate and a constructive discharge claim:\n\n         Count I, in essence, alleges . . . that Defendant failed\n         to provide her with a reasonable accommodation because of\n         her   disability   and   that   Wal-Mart   constructively\n         terminated Plaintiff’s employment in whole or in part\n         because of her disability.\n\nAppendix at 161.        The brief goes on to discuss both claims.             See\n\nAppendix at 171. Wal-Mart clearly recognized Plaintiff’s complaint\n\nplead two alternative grounds for recovery under the ADA.\n\n              Plaintiff also expressly opposed Wal-Mart’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment on her failure to accommodate claim. See Appendix\n\nat 188-192 (Section titled “Defendant is not entitled to Judgment\n\nas   a    matter   of   law   on   Plaintiff’s   claim   that   it   failed   to\n\nreasonably accommodate her disability or discriminated against her\n\nbecause of her disability”).           This argument is distinct from the\n\nfollowing section which opposes summary judgment on “Plaintiff’s\n\nclaim that [Wal-Mart] constructively terminated her employment.”\n\nAppendix at 192.        Thus, we reject Wal-Mart’s argument that Leavitt\n\ndid not raise or preserve a failure to accommodate claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f                  We also conclude the district court erred in interpreting\n\nthe    footnote          as   an    express   waiver     of   Leavitt’s   failure   to\n\naccommodate claim.              As is clear from the briefs, Leavitt stated\n\nonly       that    she    was      not   asserting   a   separate   disability-based\n\nharassment claim.3                 This footnote cannot reasonably be read to\n\nwaive Leavitt’s reasonable accommodation claim, given that she\n\nexpressly pled the claim and dedicated a significant portion of her\n\nresponse brief opposing summary judgment on this claim.\n\n                  Accordingly, we reverse the district court’s entry of\n\nsummary judgment on Count I of Plaintiff’s complaint.4                    We express\n\n\n\n       3\n      Although the First Circuit has yet to address the issue,\nseveral other Circuit courts recently have recognized a cause of\naction for disability-based harassment under the ADA. Such actions\npermit recovery based on a plaintiff’s exposure to a hostile work\nenvironment, and arise independently of claims based on the\nemployer’s failure to provide reasonable accommodations.         To\nsucceed on this claim, a plaintiff generally must demonstrate (1)\nthat she was disabled as defined by the ADA; (2) that she was\nsubjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) that the harassment\ncomplained of was based on her disability or disabilities; (4) that\nthe harassment complained of affected a term, condition, or\nprivilege of employment; and (5) that the employer knew or should\nhave known of the harassment and failed to take prompt, remedial\naction. See, e.g., Gowesky v. Singing River Hosp. Systems, 321\nF.3d 503, 509 (5th Cir. 2003); Fox v. General Motors Corp., 247\nF.3d 169, 176 (4th Cir. 2001); Keever v. City of Middletown, 145\nF.3d 809, 813 (6th Cir. 1998); Cody v. CIGNA Healthcare, 139 F.3d\n595, 598 (8th Cir. 1998); see also Silk v. City of Chicago, 194\nF.3d 788 (7th Cir. 1999) (assuming, without deciding, that such a\nclaim is legally cognizable under ADA); Walton v. Mental Health\nAss'n, 168 F.3d 661, 666-67 (3d Cir. 1999) (same).\n       4\n      Count II asserts violations of the Maine Human Rights Act and\npleads only Plaintiff’s constructive discharge as grounds for\nrecovery.

Plaintiff Anna Leavitt\n\nbrought   suit   against   her   former   employer,   Defendant   Wal-Mart\n\nStores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”), alleging discrimination in violation of\n\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 -\n\n12213 (2000), and Maine state law.           Leavitt claimed she is a\n\nqualified person with a disability as defined by the ADA and that\n\nWal-Mart failed to reasonably accommodate her disability leading to\n\nher constructive discharge. On cross-motions for summary judgment,\n\nthe district court concluded the treatment Leavitt alleged was not\n\nsufficiently severe to establish a constructive discharge.             The\n\ncourt also concluded Leavitt was not seeking damages apart from her\n\nconstructive discharge claim.         Accordingly, the court entered\n\njudgment in favor of Wal-Mart on her discrimination claims.1\n\n           Plaintiff appeals, asserting (1) the district erred in\n\ngranting Wal-Mart summary judgment on her constructive discharge\n\nclaim; and (2) the court erred in failing to address her claim that\n\nWal-Mart discriminated against her by failing to provide reasonable\n\naccommodations.2    We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n\n\n     1\n      Leavitt also filed a claim seeking damages for intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress.     The district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of Wal-Mart on this claim after\nconcluding the treatment Leavitt alleged was not sufficiently\nextreme or outrageous to permit recovery. Leavitt does not appeal\nthis ruling.\n     2\n      In the interest of judicial economy, it may have been\npreferable for Leavitt to bring this alleged error to the attention\nof the district court by filing a Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) or a Motion for Relief from\n\n                                    -2-\n\f1291.   We affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment on\n\nLeavitt’s     constructive    discharge         claim,   but    remand   for\n\nconsideration of Leavitt’s reasonable accommodation claim.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            Leavitt worked at the Wal-Mart store in Falmouth, Maine\n\nfrom approximately August 7, 1998 to May 10, 2000.             Shortly after\n\nshe began her employment, Wal-Mart promoted Leavitt from a sales\n\nassociate’s position to a management position in its in-store\n\nrestaurant.     Store records indicate Leavitt received positive\n\nperformance     evaluations    and        was    performing     all   duties\n\nsatisfactorily.    In March 1999, Leavitt suffered a heart attack.\n\n            Leavitt asserts she became disabled within the meaning of\n\nthe ADA due to health problems associated with the heart attack.\n\nAs a result of these health problems, Leavitt has difficulty\n\nbreathing and walking and suffers from increased fatigue and\n\noccasional panic attacks. On several occasions, Leavitt’s physical\n\ncondition required her to seek medical attention.              As a result,\n\nLeavitt’s treating physician documented her condition and placed\n\nrestrictions on her work, including limits on both the hours she\n\n\n\n\nJudgment pursuant to Rule 60. But, as Wal-Mart properly conceded\nat oral argument, there is nothing in either the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure or the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure that\nmandate this approach. Following the district court’s entry of\nfinal judgment purporting to dispose of all claims, this court had\njurisdiction over Leavitt’s claim.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fcan work and the amount of weight she can lift.                Leavitt provided\n\nthis documentation to Wal-Mart.\n\n            Upon   Leavitt’s    return       to   work,    Wal-Mart    management\n\nproposed to transfer her from her former position to a position\n\nthat would require less physical exertion.                 After observing that\n\nLeavitt still struggled to perform her duties, management proposed\n\na second transfer to a position that required even less physical\n\nexertion.    Both transfers occurred after discussions with Leavitt\n\nand with her consent.       Wal-Mart management viewed the transfers as\n\nan   accommodation    for    Leavitt’s       medical      condition.       Despite\n\ntransferring    Leavitt     from   a   management         position    to   a   sales\n\nassociate position, Wal-Mart did not reduce her hourly wage.\n\n            Before her heart attack, Leavitt primarily worked the day\n\nshift, but covered the evening shift on occasion.                    When Leavitt\n\ntransferred to the new positions, her schedule changed such that\n\nshe was working almost exclusively evening shifts. Leavitt was led\n\nto believe this change would be temporary, but after several months\n\nshe saw no indication Wal-Mart was attempting to find another\n\nemployee to cover the evening shifts.                Leavitt asserts working\n\nevening shifts increased her fatigue, which in turn exacerbated her\n\nbreathing and walking problems.          Leavitt made several requests to\n\nvarious members of the management team in an effort to have her\n\nschedule changed.     Wal-Mart did not accommodate these requests.\n\nThere is some evidence Leavitt was led to believe she would not be\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fscheduled to work at all if she insisted on only working day\n\nshifts.\n\n            Leavitt lives in Casco, Maine and, after her heart\n\nattack,    found    the     lengthy   commute       to   Falmouth     increased   her\n\nfatigue.       She informed Wal-Mart management she would like to\n\ntransfer to a Wal-Mart store located in Windham, Maine, which was\n\nsignificantly closer to her home.                   The Falmouth store manager\n\nencouraged Leavitt to investigate openings at the Windham store,\n\nbut when she informed him of openings took no action to initiate a\n\ntransfer.\n\n            Leavitt       also   asserts      she    experienced      some   hostile\n\nreactions    to    her    disability.       Several       evening-shift      managers\n\nrepeatedly confronted Leavitt as she left work, demanding to know\n\nwhy she was able to leave early.                 These confrontations occurred\n\ndespite documentation in her work file limiting her shifts to six\n\nhours.      Wal-Mart also would not permit Leavitt to park in a\n\nhandicapped spot until she obtained a handicapped parking permit.\n\nAfter obtaining the permit, Leavitt endured comments that she\n\nwasn’t really handicapped and that she must feel entitled to\n\nspecial treatment.          Leavitt also asserts her direct supervisor\n\nasked her to work hours and perform duties beyond those permitted\n\nby her documented medical restrictions.                  These requests continued\n\neven   after      Leavitt    informed      the      supervisor   of    her    medical\n\ncondition.\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f              Finally, in late April, Leavitt received notice of a\n\nschedule change that allowed her to work two day shifts over the\n\nnext three-week period.         She verified the schedule change with the\n\nstore   manager.        But   Leavitt’s    direct    supervisor   subsequently\n\nassigned the day shifts to another employee once again leaving\n\nLeavitt   with     only   evening    shifts.        Leavitt   confronted      the\n\nsupervisor about the schedule change, but the supervisor made it\n\nclear the change would stand. After discussing the matter with her\n\nsupervisor, Leavitt believed Wal-Mart would fire her if she did not\n\ncomply with the change.         She also discovered that her day shifts\n\nhad been assigned to a new, non-disabled employee.                The schedule\n\nchange directly conflicts with Wal-Mart’s stated scheduling policy,\n\nwhich reserves coveted day-time shifts for employees with more\n\nseniority and requires a manager to consult with an employee prior\n\nto implementing a schedule change.\n\n              Frustrated with Wal-Mart’s refusal to accommodate her\n\nrequests for a schedule change or a store transfer, and frustrated\n\nwith    her   supervisor’s      failure     to    comply   with   store   policy\n\nconcerning scheduling, Leavitt terminated her employment with Wal-\n\nMart.\n\n                                      II.\n\n              Leavitt   first    asserts    the    district   court   erred    in\n\ngranting summary judgment on her constructive discharge claim.                 We\n\nreview de novo the district court’s grant of summary judgment,\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fviewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light\n\nmost favorable to the non-moving party.

See Suarez, 229 F.3d at 55.\n\n             There   is   no   evidence    Leavitt’s   job   transfers   were\n\nanything other than a desired accommodation of her health problems.\n\nLeavitt also does not claim Wal-Mart reduced her hours or her\n\nhourly wage.     Leavitt’s only complaints, that Wal-Mart failed to\n\naccommodate her requests for a transfer and for more day shifts,\n\nand failed to follow policy in awarding day shifts, are not so\n\nsevere and did not produce working conditions so unpleasant that\n\nstaying on the job would have been intolerable.              Leavitt did not\n\nproduce any evidence that working evening shifts and commuting to\n\nFalmouth had a dramatic impact on her health conditions or that she\n\nwas unable to continue her work.

In that footnote, Leavitt noted:\n\n     Defendant has moved for summary judgment, or to dismiss,\n     a “claim” that Plaintiff never raised; that the\n     disability-based harassment she endured at the hands of\n     Defendant’s management entitles her to damages under the\n     ADA or MHRA. This was not Plaintiff’s claim; Plaintiff\n     mentioned the incidents in her Statement of Material\n     Facts Not in Dispute in order to show inter alia,\n     Defendant’s awareness of Plaintiff’s disability and\n     resulting restrictions; the stress and frustration this\n     caused Plaintiff and as direct and circumstantial\n     evidence of Defendant’s discriminatory animus towards her\n     based on her disability.\n\n\nAppendix at 214-15(italics in original, citations omitted).             This\n\nfootnote appeared in response to Wal-Mart’s brief in opposition to\n\nplaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment.          In that brief,\n\nWal-Mart argued:\n\n     It also appears that the Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial\n     Summary Judgment, for the first time, alleges that\n     Defendant engaged in disability based harassment by Wal-\n     Mart management. However, nowhere in Plaintiff’s initial\n     Complaint was there an allegation (or inference) that the\n     Plaintiff was the subject of disability based harassment.\n     At the outset, therefore, Defendant requests the Court to\n     dismiss this claim....”\n\nAppendix at 200 (citations and emphasis omitted).             In support of\n\nthe district court’s grant of summary judgment, Wal-Mart argues\n\nboth that Leavitt failed to raise a reasonable accommodation claim\n\nin the proceedings before the district court and that, even if\n\nraised, the district court correctly concluded Leavitt expressly\n\nwaived the claim based on the referenced footnote.\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f            Leavitt raised the claim in both her pleadings and motion\n\nbriefs.     In   her   complaint,    Leavitt   clearly   pled    failure   to\n\naccommodate as a ground for recovery.             In Count I, Plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaint     asserts     Wal-Mart      engaged     in   disability-based\n\ndiscrimination in violation of the ADA.            This Count raises two\n\ndistinct theories of recovery under the ADA: a claim that Wal-Mart\n\nfailed to provide reasonable accommodation and a claim that this\n\nfailure lead to Plaintiff’s constructive discharge.             Paragraph 29\n\nof the Complaint states:\n\n     Wal-Mart failed to provide Plaintiff with a reasonable\n     accommodation because of her disability.      The record\n     establishes that Plaintiff is an otherwise qualified\n     individual with a disability, entitled to reasonable\n     accommodations to her known physical limitations.\n     Plaintiff sought these reasonable accommodations – being\n     assigned to the Fitting Department, having her shifts\n     occur during the day and a transfer to a location closer\n     to her home. Wal-Mart refused to take these simple steps\n     to   accommodate  Plaintiff   solely   because   of  her\n     disability.\n\nAppendix at 11.         This paragraph states a claim separate and\n\ndistinct from Leavitt’s constructive discharge claim, which appears\n\nin Paragraph 28 of the Complaint.\n\n            Plaintiff also performed discovery on the reasonable\n\naccommodation claim, and dedicated a section of her Statement of\n\nMaterial Facts to this claim.        See Appendix at 33 (Section titled\n\n“Wal-Mart Refuses to Reasonably Accommodate Plaintiff’s Requests to\n\neither be Rescheduled to the Day Shift in Falmouth, or to be\n\nTransferred to its Windham Store”).            Plaintiff also raised the\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fissue in her motion for partial summary judgment by seeking summary\n\njudgment on Wal-Mart’s affirmative defense that it had provided\n\nreasonable accommodations.          Appendix at 125.\n\n              Defendant clearly was on notice of Leavitt’s reasonable\n\naccommodation claim.          In its motion for summary judgment, Wal-Mart\n\ndescribes Count I of Leavitt’s Complaint as asserting both a\n\nfailure to accommodate and a constructive discharge claim:\n\n         Count I, in essence, alleges . . . that Defendant failed\n         to provide her with a reasonable accommodation because of\n         her   disability   and   that   Wal-Mart   constructively\n         terminated Plaintiff’s employment in whole or in part\n         because of her disability.\n\nAppendix at 161.        The brief goes on to discuss both claims.             See\n\nAppendix at 171. Wal-Mart clearly recognized Plaintiff’s complaint\n\nplead two alternative grounds for recovery under the ADA.\n\n              Plaintiff also expressly opposed Wal-Mart’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment on her failure to accommodate claim. See Appendix\n\nat 188-192 (Section titled “Defendant is not entitled to Judgment\n\nas   a    matter   of   law   on   Plaintiff’s   claim   that   it   failed   to\n\nreasonably accommodate her disability or discriminated against her\n\nbecause of her disability”).           This argument is distinct from the\n\nfollowing section which opposes summary judgment on “Plaintiff’s\n\nclaim that [Wal-Mart] constructively terminated her employment.”\n\nAppendix at 192.        Thus, we reject Wal-Mart’s argument that Leavitt\n\ndid not raise or preserve a failure to accommodate claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f                  We also conclude the district court erred in interpreting\n\nthe    footnote          as   an    express   waiver     of   Leavitt’s   failure   to\n\naccommodate claim.              As is clear from the briefs, Leavitt stated\n\nonly       that    she    was      not   asserting   a   separate   disability-based\n\nharassment claim.3                 This footnote cannot reasonably be read to\n\nwaive Leavitt’s reasonable accommodation claim, given that she\n\nexpressly pled the claim and dedicated a significant portion of her\n\nresponse brief opposing summary judgment on this claim.\n\n                  Accordingly, we reverse the district court’s entry of\n\nsummary judgment on Count I of Plaintiff’s complaint.4                    We express\n\n\n\n       3\n      Although the First Circuit has yet to address the issue,\nseveral other Circuit courts recently have recognized a cause of\naction for disability-based harassment under the ADA. Such actions\npermit recovery based on a plaintiff’s exposure to a hostile work\nenvironment, and arise independently of claims based on the\nemployer’s failure to provide reasonable accommodations.         To\nsucceed on this claim, a plaintiff generally must demonstrate (1)\nthat she was disabled as defined by the ADA; (2) that she was\nsubjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) that the harassment\ncomplained of was based on her disability or disabilities; (4) that\nthe harassment complained of affected a term, condition, or\nprivilege of employment; and (5) that the employer knew or should\nhave known of the harassment and failed to take prompt, remedial\naction.
