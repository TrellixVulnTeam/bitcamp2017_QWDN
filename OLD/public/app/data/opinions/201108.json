Defendant-appellant     Andre    D.   Tucker\n\n(\"Tucker\") appeals the sentence imposed by the district court\n\nchallenging the two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1)\n\nfor possession of a firearm.          We affirm.\n\n           Tucker was arrested at his apartment on February 3,\n\n2000.1   Agents found a loaded .380 semiautomatic pistol with an\n\nobliterated serial number and $2,590.00 in cash in Tucker's bedroom\n\nand 78.13 grams of crack cocaine in a locked case in the basement\n\nof Tucker's building. Two other tenants lived in Tucker's building\n\nin separate apartments; all had access to the basement.\n\n           Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Tucker pleaded\n\nguilty to a 10-count information.            Count Ten charged Tucker with\n\npossession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,\n\nin   violation    of   18    U.S.C.   §   924(c).2   At   Tucker's      initial\n\nsentencing hearing, the district court determined that Tucker's\n\nbase offense level was 32, with a four-level leader/organizer\n\nenhancement      pursuant    to   U.S.S.G.   §   3B1.1   and   a   three-level\n\n\n1\n   The arrest occurred after Tucker and several co-conspirators\nmade cocaine sales to an undercover officer and an informant\nbetween June and August 1999.\n2\n   Count One charged Tucker with conspiracy to distribute cocaine\nand cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846.      Counts Two\nthrough Seven charged Tucker with distribution of cocaine and\ncocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2. Count Eight charged Tucker with possession of cocaine base\nwith intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1)\nand 18 U.S.C. § 2. Count Nine charged Tucker with possession of a\nfirearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922\n(g)(1).\n\n                                       -2-\n\freduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3E1.1.     Accordingly, the district court found Tucker's total\n\noffense level to be 33 and designated a criminal history category\n\nof V, yielding a guideline range of 210 to 266 months.      The court\n\nsentenced Tucker to 230 months imprisonment on Counts One through\n\nEight, to be served concurrently, 120 months imprisonment on Count\n\nNine, to be served concurrently with the sentences for Counts One\n\nthrough Eight, and 60 months imprisonment for Count Ten, to run\n\nconsecutive to the other sentences.\n\n           Tucker appealed, arguing that his convictions on Counts\n\nEight and Ten should be vacated due to errors during the plea\n\ncolloquy. The government conceded that its recitation of the facts\n\nin support of the § 924(c) charge was deficient under Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 11(f), primarily because it had stated that the cocaine was\n\ndiscovered    in   Tucker's   bedroom.   This   court   accepted   the\n\ngovernment's concession, vacated Tucker's conviction on Count Ten,\n\nand remanded the case for further proceedings.     See United States\n\nv. Tucker, No. 00-2192 (1st Cir. Apr. 1, 2002).\n\n           The government declined to prosecute the § 924(c) count\n\nafter remand.      At the re-sentencing hearing, the district court\n\ndetermined that Tucker's base offense level was 32, with a four-\n\nlevel leader/organizer enhancement, a two-level enhancement for\n\npossession of a firearm under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1), and a three-\n\nlevel reduction for acceptance of responsibility.       Tucker did not\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fobject to the two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm at\n\nthe sentencing hearing.      The court found Tucker's total offense\n\nlevel to be 35 and designated a criminal history category at V,\n\nyielding a guideline range of 262 to 327 months.              Tucker was\n\nsentenced to 290 months imprisonment on Counts One and Eight, 240\n\nmonths imprisonment on Counts Two through Seven, and 120 months\n\nimprisonment    on   Count   Nine,   all   sentences     to   be   served\n\nconcurrently.    Tucker appeals once more, now arguing that the\n\ndistrict court erred in enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2D1.1(b)(1) for possession of a firearm.\n\n          Since Tucker did not object at trial to the two-level\n\nenhancement, we review for plain error only.     See United States v.\n\nConnolly, 341 F.3d 16, 31 (1st Cir. 2003).      Tucker therefore must\n\nestablish \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or\n\nobvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial\n\nrights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.\"            United States v.\n\nSabetta, No. 03-1506, 2004 WL 1403353, at *3 (1st Cir. June 24,\n\n2004)(citations omitted).     Because Tucker has failed to meet this\n\nburden, we affirm.\n\n          Tucker concedes that he possessed the gun.           He argues\n\nthat the government failed to prove the gun was present during the\n\ncharged offense.     He bases this argument on application note 3 to\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1), which states:\n\n            The adjustment should be applied if the weapon\n            was present, unless it is clearly improbable\n            that the weapon was connected with the\n            offense. For example, the enhancement would\n            not be applied if the defendant, arrested at\n            his residence, had an unloaded hunting rifle\n            in the closet.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1), comment n.3.\n\n            Tucker argues that there was no evidence the gun was\n\npresent during the controlled sales he made to the undercover\n\nofficer and informant in the summer of 1999.        Furthermore, he\n\nargues that the gun found in his apartment was not \"present\" in\n\nrelation to the cocaine found in the basement because all the\n\ntenants in the building had access to the basement.    We disagree.\n\n            Factual determinations made in the course of sentencing\n\nmust be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.        See United\n\nStates v. McDonald, 121 F.3d 7, 9 (1st Cir. 1997).      While there\n\nmust be a certain nexus between the weapon and the offense for the\n\nenhancement to apply, it is well settled in this circuit that \"when\n\nthe weapon's location makes it readily available to protect either\n\nthe participants themselves during the commission of the illegal\n\nactivity or the drugs and cash involved in the drug business, there\n\nwill be sufficient evidence to connect the weapon(s) to the offense\n\nconduct.\"    Id. at 10 (quoting United States v. Corcimiglia, 967\n\nF.2d 724, 727 (1st Cir. 1992)(internal quotations omitted)(holding\n\nthat the two-level enhancement was appropriate where drugs, cash\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fand drug scales were found in defendant's parlor and a gun was\n\nfound in a secret compartment in defendant's bathroom vanity)).\n\nTucker was arrested at his home with a significant amount of cash\n\nand a loaded gun in his bedroom as well as cocaine in the basement\n\nof his building.    The fact that other tenants had access to the\n\nbasement does not alter the result.      Tucker admitted that the\n\ncocaine in the basement was his in pleading guilty to possessing\n\nthe cocaine with intent to distribute it.    The gun's location in\n\nTucker's bedroom made it readily available to Tucker to protect his\n\ncash and the drugs in the basement.     See id.; United States v.\n\nPaulino, 887 F.2d 358 (1st Cir. 1989)(holding that the two-level\n\nenhancement was appropriate where the gun, cash, and a drug ledger\n\nwere found in one apartment and the drugs were found in a different\n\napartment in the same building).\n\n          The two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm\n\n\"reflects the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers\n\npossess weapons.\"   U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1), comment n.3; see United\n\nStates v. Almonte (stating that \"it is not unreasonable to believe\n\nthat drug distributors who have loaded guns nearby are likely to\n\nuse the guns in committing or attempting to commit drug offenses\").\n\nIn this case, the gun in Tucker's bedroom was loaded, readily\n\navailable for Tucker's use should the need arise.        From this\n\nevidence the district court concluded, amply supported by the\n\nevidence, that Tucker possessed the loaded gun to protect himself,\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fhis drugs in the basement, and the cash in his apartment.

From this\n\nevidence the district court concluded, amply supported by the\n\nevidence, that Tucker possessed the loaded gun to protect himself,\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fhis drugs in the basement, and the cash in his apartment.
