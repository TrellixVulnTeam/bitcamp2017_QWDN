Girón-Anadón, Deputy Solicitor General, and Rosa\nElena Pérez-Agosto, Assistant Solicitor General, were on brief, for\nappellees Vélez and Renta.\n\n\n\n                          August 18, 2011\n\n\n\n     *\n      The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f             LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.        Appellant Héctor Luis Román-\n\nOliveras (\"Román\") claims that he was an exemplary employee at the\n\nPuerto Rico Electric Power Authority (\"the Authority\" or \"PREPA\")\n\nfor more than two decades despite suffering from schizophrenia\n\nthroughout the period of his employment.          In this action against\n\nthe Authority and two PREPA supervisors, he alleges that he was\n\ninexplicably removed from his job in 2006, required to undergo\n\nmultiple medical evaluations, and prevented from resuming his\n\nduties even though each evaluation pronounced him fit to work.\n\nRomán brought this action against the Authority and two PREPA\n\nsupervisors under federal and Commonwealth law, alleging violation\n\nof his civil rights and unlawful discrimination on the basis of his\n\nmedical condition.1 The district court dismissed Román's complaint\n\nin its entirety.     It discerned no basis for relief under federal\n\nlaw   and,   accordingly,     declined    to   address   the    supplemental\n\nCommonwealth claims.\n\n             Although we affirm the district court's rulings on most\n\nof Román's claims, we vacate the dismissal of his claim against his\n\nemployer under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") because\n\nthe   complaint   plausibly    depicts    discrimination       based   on   the\n\nperception that Román is disabled. On an issue of first impression\n\n\n      1\n        Also listed as defendants were unnamed \"responsible\"\nparties, including the named defendants' insurers. The complaint\nidentified Román's wife, the couple's conjugal partnership, and\nRomán's mother as co-plaintiffs. For convenience, we refer in our\nanalysis only to Román and the PREPA defendants.\n\n                                    -2-\n\ffor our circuit, we conclude that Title I of the ADA does not\n\nprovide for liability against individuals who are not themselves\n\nemployers.2\n\n                                                I.\n\n                  We   recite   the     facts    in   the   manner   appropriate      for\n\nreviewing a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b):\n\n\"[W]e       'assume      the    truth    of     all   well-pleaded    facts'   in     the\n\ncomplaint,\" and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's\n\nfavor.       Rivera v. Centro Médico de Turabo, Inc., 575 F.3d 10, 13\n\n(1st       Cir.    2009)   (quoting      Centro       Medico   del   Turabo,   Inc.    v.\n\nFeliciano de Melecio, 406 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2005)).3\n\n                  Before the events at issue in this litigation, Román had\n\nworked successfully for PREPA for twenty-two years while receiving\n\nregular psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia. The condition had\n\nbeen diagnosed more than thirty years earlier.                         Román received\n\nexcellent evaluations and was always available for overtime work.\n\nBeginning in 2005, Román's immediate superior, defendant James\n\n\n\n\n       2\n       Because reactivation of the ADA claim opens the door to\nreinstatement of the supplemental Commonwealth claims, we also\nvacate the portion of the court's judgment dismissing those claims.\nSee Sepúlveda-Villarini v. Dep't of Educ. of P.R., 628 F.3d 25, 30\n(1st Cir. 2010).\n       3\n       The district court relied on both Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule\n12(b)(6) in dismissing appellant's various claims.     The same\nstandard applies to both subsections. See McCloskey v. Mueller,\n446 F.3d 262, 265-66 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                              -3-\n\fVélez, and the plant superintendent, defendant Julio Renta,4 made\n\nRomán's life difficult in retaliation for his union activities and\n\nrole as a \"leader of workm[e]n.\" Román's complaint states that the\n\nPREPA supervisors harassed him, \"making improper rude comments\n\nagainst him, taking adverse person[ne]l action and fabricating\n\nlabor cases against him.\"          The complaint accuses the defendants of\n\nattempting on one occasion to transfer Román \"without the benefit\n\nof paying him [food] and car allowance\" and of treating him\n\n\"differently from similarly situated individuals outside of his\n\nprotected group.\"        The complaint further alleges that Vélez and\n\nRenta    used    false   information     and    \"their     official   positions\n\nimproperly as employees and engineers of co-defendant PREPA\" to\n\ncause harm to Román.\n\n            On   March    1,   2006,   PREPA's    social     worker   asked   the\n\nAuthority's physician to bar Román from working until he was\n\nevaluated by a psychiatrist, and PREPA thereafter did not allow him\n\nto work.    On April 24, the social worker received the psychiatric\n\nreport, which stated that Román could resume his duties.                   On May\n\n23, PREPA \"formally acknowledge[d]\" the psychiatrist's report and\n\nrecommendation.          Román,      however,     remained     out    of    work,\n\ninvoluntarily, despite the satisfactory report.                  On August 7,\n\nPREPA's physician        ordered    \"asbestos[]    medical    evaluations\"     of\n\n\n\n     4\n      The individual appellees identify \"Renta\" as \"Rentas-Pujols\"\nin their brief. We use the name that appears in the court docket.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fRomán.   The resulting report stated that Román was \"fit for duties\n\nincluding as per his psychiatric condition.\"\n\n            Although PREPA's physicians recommended on October 17\n\nthat Román return to work, and he repeatedly asked to return,\n\ndefendant   Renta     requested   additional   medical   evaluations     on\n\nNovember 13 and referred Román for an involuntary medical leave.\n\nRomán also was asked for the evaluations of his private doctors.\n\nIn January 2007, he submitted the requested medical certification\n\nfrom his psychiatrist.     Despite findings by \"[a]ll of the doctors\"\n\nthat Román was capable of resuming his work, defendants again\n\nrefused to allow him to do so, \"changing the entire process of the\n\nreinstallation of plaintff[']s duties.\"\n\n            Román was taken off PREPA's payroll in February 2007.\n\nAlthough he alleges that he was terminated, he submitted an\n\nemployment certification in Spanish to the district court that,\n\naccording to the court, \"reflects that Román had been on medical\n\nleave, without pay, since February 10, 2007.\"            The defendants\n\npresented a translated employment certification stating that, as of\n\nSeptember 5, 2007, Román remained a PREPA employee \"hold[ing] the\n\nregular position of Central Power Plant Electrician II.\"               The\n\ncomplaint alleges, however, that Renta and Vélez ordered removal of\n\nRomán's personal items from the work area, removal of his name\n\nfrom his    locker,    and reassignment   of   his   toolbox   to   another\n\nemployee.\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f          Román filed a timely complaint with the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission and subsequently filed this action, alleging\n\nviolations of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213;5 Title VII of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to 2000e-17; the civil\n\nrights provision codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and Articles 1802\n\nand 1803 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, §§\n\n5141, 5142. He alleged that defendants' actions violated his civil\n\nrights, created a hostile work environment, and subjected him to\n\n\"adverse actions because of his medical condition and active\n\nparticipation with the Union.\"\n\n          Defendants moved for dismissal and, after an exchange of\n\nupdated pleadings, the district court dismissed with prejudice each\n\nof the federal claims in plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint. The\n\ncourt concluded that the hostile work environment claim was time-\n\nbarred, that Román failed to allege facts showing that he was\n\ndisabled within the meaning of the ADA, and that he had alleged\n\n\"neither . . . a specific violation of federal law nor any\n\nindependent facts\" to support his section 1983 claim.    Given the\n\ndeficiencies in the federal causes of action, the court declined to\n\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over the associated Commonwealth\n\nclaims and dismissed them without prejudice.\n\n\n\n     5\n       The complaint did not specify the title of the ADA under\nwhich suit was brought, but the district court accepted the Title\nI characterization adopted in plaintiff's opposition to defendants'\nmotion to dismiss. We do likewise.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f           On appeal, appellant continues to press his ADA and\n\nsection 1983 claims, but implicitly in his brief and explicitly at\n\noral argument conceded the inadequacy of the complaint's Title VII\n\nallegations.    We therefore limit our discussion to the disability\n\nand civil rights claims.6     Our review is de novo.     See Coggeshall\n\nv. Mass. Bd. of Registration of Psychologists, 604 F.3d 658, 662\n\n(1st Cir. 2010) (applying de novo review to claims dismissed under\n\nsubsections (1) and (6) of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)).\n\n                                     II.\n\nA. Section 1983\n\n           Section 1983 does not provide \"any substantive rights\n\nindependent of those already granted under federal law,\" Clark v.\n\nBoscher, 514 F.3d 107, 112 (1st Cir. 2008), and a plaintiff seeking\n\nto recover under that provision must therefore \"identify the\n\nspecific constitutional [or statutory] right allegedly infringed,\"\n\nAlbright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 271 (1994); see also Nieves v.\n\nMcSweeney, 241 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir. 2001).        Appellant's complaint\n\nlacks any such specificity. Although the complaint alleges that he\n\nwas   treated   differently   from    \"similarly   situated   individuals\n\n\n\n      6\n       It is not clear from the complaint whether appellant's\nhostile environment claim is disability-based or linked to his\nunion and other leadership activities. Its precise nature does not\nin any event matter because appellant's brief does not address the\ncourt's rejection of that claim and, accordingly, we deem it\nwaived. See Sepúlveda-Villarini, 628 F.3d at 28. Hence, in our\ndiscussion of the ADA, we consider only the claim that Román was\nunlawfully removed from his job on account of his disability.\n\n                                     -7-\n\foutside of his protected group\" – language evocative of an equal\n\nprotection claim – he has never asserted a violation of the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Constitution.7\n\n            Nor does the complaint use the term \"due process,\" which\n\nRomán now argues is the right underlying his section 1983 claim.\n\nHe maintains that the paragraphs in the complaint describing\n\nPREPA's repeated refusal to reinstate him were sufficient to frame\n\na procedural due process violation because, in the words of the\n\ncomplaint, the defendants \"chang[ed] the entire process of the\n\nreinstallation of plaintiff[']s duties.\"\n\n            The   allegations   concerning     the    \"process\"   of    his\n\nreinstatement,    however,   establish   the   factual   basis    for   his\n\ndisability discrimination claim, i.e., that he was repeatedly\n\nforced to undergo medical evaluations and prevented from working\n\ndespite reports showing that his schizophrenia did not affect his\n\ncapacity to work.      See infra Part II.B.          Without more, those\n\nallegations do not also signal a due process claim.         Such a claim\n\nrequires a showing that the plaintiff was deprived of a protected\n\nliberty or property interest without \"adequate notice and an\n\nopportunity to be heard 'at a meaningful time and in a meaningful\n\nmanner.'\"   Aponte-Rosario v. Acevedo-Vilá, 617 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n\n     7\n       The district court noted that appellant's perfunctory\nallegation that he experienced adverse treatment because of his\n\"active participation with the Union\" may suggest a constitutional\nclaim, but any such cause of action was too insufficiently\ndeveloped to warrant consideration. We agree.\n\n                                  -8-\n\f2010) (quoting Amsden v. Moran, 904 F.2d 748, 753 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\nAppellant's complaint does not identify a protectible interest, and\n\nit says nothing about either lack of notice or the absence of a\n\nmeaningful opportunity to be heard.8\n\n                In effect, appellant asks that his section 1983 cause of\n\naction be saved because the allegation of faulty procedures could\n\nhave supported a second, constitutional theory of recovery.              The\n\ndue process theory was not articulated in the complaint, however,\n\nand appellant thus failed with regard to this claim to comply with\n\nthe requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) that\n\n\"every complaint contain 'a short and plain statement of the claim\n\nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief.'\" Ocasio-Hernández\n\nv. Fortuño-Burset, 640 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting Fed. R.\n\nCiv.       P.   8(a)(2));   id.   (explaining   that   the   Rule   \"requires\n\nsufficient detail in the complaint to give a defendant fair notice\n\nof the claim and the grounds upon which it rests\").            We therefore\n\naffirm dismissal of the section 1983 claim.\n\n\n       8\n       At oral argument, appellant's counsel asserted that Román\nhas a property interest in his job because he is a public employee.\nAlthough Román alleged that PREPA is \"a public corporation and\ngovernment agency,\" government employment does not always confer a\nproperty interest and related procedural due process rights. See\nConcepción Chaparro v. Ruiz-Hernández, 607 F.3d 261, 264 (1st Cir.\n2010) (\"In order for plaintiffs to have procedural due process\nrights in their employment, each plaintiff must have had a\nreasonable expectation, based on a statute, policy, rule, or\ncontract, that he or she would continue to be employed.\").        In\nkeeping with his failure to allege other elements of a due process\nclaim, Román did not allege a basis for a property interest in his\nposition.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fB. ADA\n\n            To state a claim of disability discrimination under Title\n\nI of the ADA, Román needed to allege facts showing that (1) he was\n\ndisabled within the meaning of the Act; (2) he could perform the\n\nessential   functions   of   his   job,   with     or   without   reasonable\n\naccommodation, and (3) the employer took adverse action against\n\nhim, in whole or in part, because of his disability.              Ruiz Rivera\n\nv. Pfizer Pharm., LLC, 521 F.3d 76, 82 (1st Cir. 2008); Bailey v.\n\nGa.-Pac. Corp., 306 F.3d 1162, 1166 (1st Cir. 2002). An individual\n\nis disabled for purposes of the ADA if he (1) has a physical or\n\nmental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life\n\nactivities; (2) has a record of such an impairment; or (3) is\n\nregarded as having such an impairment.           Ruiz Rivera, 521 F.3d at\n\n82; see also 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2) (2008).9\n\n            The district court concluded that Román had failed to\n\nallege facts sufficient to establish that he was disabled under any\n\nof the statute's three definitions.          We agree that the complaint\n\nfalls short on the first two alternatives.         As to the first option,\n\nthe district court correctly noted that Román did not allege that\n\nschizophrenia    substantially     limited   any    aspect   of    his   life,\n\n\n     9\n       The ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325,\n§ 2(a)(4)-(6), 122 Stat. 3553, which took effect January 1, 2009,\ndoes not apply here, as the Act does not retroactively cover\nactivities that occurred before its passage. See Carreras v. Sajo,\nGarcia & Partners, 596 F.3d 25, 33 n.7 (1st Cir. 2010).         We\ntherefore rely on the pre-amendment statutory provisions and the\ncase law interpreting those provisions.\n\n                                   -10-\n\fincluding his ability to work.               Indeed, the thrust of appellant's\n\ncomplaint is that he was fully capable of working, but was unfairly\n\ndenied the opportunity to do so \"because of his medical condition.\"\n\nHe thus has not stated a claim of disability discrimination based\n\non the condition of schizophrenia itself.\n\n           For a similar reason, the district court correctly found\n\nthat Román's complaint failed to satisfy the \"record of impairment\"\n\nprong of the disability definition.                  The \"record\" provision is\n\ndesigned \"to protect those who have recovered or are recovering\n\nfrom substantially limiting impairments from discrimination based\n\non their medical history.\"              Bailey, 306 F.3d at 1169.            Thus, to\n\nqualify for ADA coverage on the basis of this provision, Román\n\nwould   need   to   show    that       in    the   past    he   had,   \"or   has   been\n\nmisclassified as having, an impairment that substantially limited\n\na major life activity.\"          Id.    Again, because Román has not alleged\n\nsubstantial limitations as a result of schizophrenia, he failed to\n\nstate an ADA claim based on having a record of impairment.\n\n           Finally,        the    district         court    rejected     appellant's\n\n\"regarded as\" claim on the ground that he had \"failed to allege\n\nfacts sufficient to show that defendants ever regarded Román's\n\nschizophrenia as having a substantial impact on his work.\"                          To\n\nprove a   regarded    as claim          against     his employer,       a    plaintiff\n\nordinarily must show either that the employer (1) \"mistakenly\n\nbelieves that [he] has a physical impairment that substantially\n\n\n\n                                            -11-\n\flimits one or more major life activities,\" or (2) \"mistakenly\n\nbelieves that   an   actual, nonlimiting     impairment   substantially\n\nlimits one or more major life activities.\"        Sutton v. United Air\n\nLines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 489 (1999), superseded by statute, ADA\n\nAmendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, § 2(a)(4)-(6), 122\n\nStat. 3553; see also Ruiz Rivera, 521 F.3d at 83; Sullivan v.\n\nNeiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 358 F.3d 110, 117 (1st Cir. 2004).          We\n\nfocus on the second of these alternatives.10\n\n           To survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must allege\n\n\"only enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on\n\nits face.\"   Bell Atl. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).          \"A\n\nclaim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual\n\ncontent that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that\n\nthe defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"        Ashcroft v.\n\nIqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009).    According to the allegations\n\nin the complaint, Román was removed from his position and forced to\n\nundergo   multiple   medical   evaluations   at   the   behest   of   the\n\ndefendants, and also was required to submit a medical certification\n\nfrom his treating psychiatrist.      Despite favorable test results\n\neach time, defendants persisted in refusing to allow Román to work.\n\n\n\n     10\n       Appellees assert that Román failed to argue in his brief on\nappeal that he was disabled under the \"regarded as\" prong and has\nthus waived that issue. Although Román's entire brief is barely\nadequate, we do not consider the claim waived. In addition, we see\nno prejudice in reaching the issue; the district court addressed it\non the merits, as did appellees in their appellate briefing.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f            Taken as true, these allegations, together with the\n\nallegation that Román always performed his job well, readily\n\nsupport three      pertinent   inferences:      (1)    defendants   mistakenly\n\nbelieved that Román's psychiatric condition substantially limited\n\nhis ability to do his job; (2) they refused to let him work based\n\non that erroneous, discriminatory judgment; and (3) they repeatedly\n\nattempted    to    justify   removing   him    from    his   job   through   the\n\npsychiatric and other medical testing. To state a violation of the\n\nADA when the major life activity at issue is working, however,\n\nRomán must show \"'not only that the employer thought that he was\n\nimpaired in his ability to do the job that he held, but also that\n\nthe employer regarded him as substantially impaired in \"either a\n\nclass of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as\n\ncompared    with   the   average   person     having   comparable    training,\n\nskills, and abilities.\"'\"          Ruiz Rivera, 521 F.3d at 83 (quoting\n\nSullivan, 358 F.3d at 117 (quoting Murphy v. United Parcel Serv.,\n\nInc., 527 U.S. 516, 523 (1999))).\n\n            Although the complaint does not explicitly assert that\n\nPREPA had such a broad perception of Román's incapacity, the\n\nallegations are sufficient to embrace that contention.               According\n\nto the complaint, PREPA removed Román from his position without any\n\nmeaningful effort to offer him alternative positions appropriate\n\nfor whatever limitations his employer attributed to him.                 Román\n\nalleges one attempted transfer, but his objections to it – based on\n\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fdenial of food and travel allowance – suggest it was a temporary\n\nrelocation rather than reassignment to a new position deemed more\n\nsuitable   for    his   abilities.     In   any    event,   given   that   the\n\ndisability at issue is a mental condition rather than a discrete\n\nphysical limitation, defendants' actions in removing Román and\n\nrepeatedly demanding psychiatric evaluations permit the inference\n\nthat defendants deemed him disqualified from a broad range of jobs.\n\nCf. Quiles-Quiles v. Henderson, 439 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(concluding      that   supervisors'   belief     that   plaintiff's   mental\n\nimpairment posed a safety risk to coworkers, \"preclud[ing] him from\n\nholding most jobs in our economy,\" permitted jurors to find that\n\nemployer regarded him as disabled); Watts v. United Parcel Serv.,\n\n378 F. App'x 520, 526 (6th Cir. 2010) (unpublished) (\"When a\n\ndefendant flatly bars a plaintiff from working at any job at the\n\ndefendant's company, that is generally sufficient proof that the\n\nemployer regards the plaintiff as disabled in the major life\n\nactivity of working so as to preclude the defendant being awarded\n\njudgment as a matter of law.\").\n\n           Román has thus made a sufficient showing of disability\n\nwithin the meaning of the ADA to survive defendants' motion to\n\ndismiss.   His allegations easily satisfy the other two pleading\n\nprerequisites for his claim to proceed: that he could perform the\n\nessential functions of his job and that PREPA took adverse action\n\nagainst him, in whole or in part, because of his disability.                We\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fsee no alternative view of the allegations that is \"'just as much\n\nin line' with innocent conduct\" as with disability discrimination,\n\nOcasio, 640 F.3d at 11 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 554); see also\n\nIqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949, and Román has thus passed \"the line\n\nbetween possibility and plausibility\" in asserting a regarded-as\n\nviolation of the ADA, Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557.\n\n          We hasten to add that we offer no view on the merits of\n\nhis claim.   The question at this stage of the case is not \"the\n\nlikelihood that a causal connection will prove out as fact.\"\n\nSepúlveda-Villarini, 628 F.3d at 30.     Rather, \"the standard is\n\nplausibility assuming the pleaded facts to be true and read in a\n\nplaintiff's favor.\"   Id.; see also Twombly, 550 U.S. at 563 n.8\n\n(\"[W]hen a complaint adequately states a claim, it may not be\n\ndismissed based on a district court's assessment that the plaintiff\n\nwill fail to find evidentiary support for his allegations or prove\n\nhis claim to the satisfaction of the factfinder.\").      Here, the\n\npleaded facts support \"[a] plausible but inconclusive inference\" of\n\ndiscrimination based on disability, Sepúlveda-Villarini, 628 F.3d\n\nat 30, and Román is therefore entitled to proceed with his ADA\n\nclaim.\n\nC. Individual Liability\n\n          Appellees Vélez and Renta argue that, regardless of our\n\nview of the sufficiency of the ADA allegations, they should be\n\ndismissed from the case because individuals are not subject to\n\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fliability under Title I of the statute.         They acknowledge that\n\nneither we nor the Supreme Court has explicitly rejected individual\n\nliability under the ADA, but point out that a number of other\n\ncircuits have taken that view.11     See Albra v. Advan, Inc., 490 F.3d\n\n826, 830 (11th Cir. 2007); Walsh v. Nev. Dep't of Human Res., 471\n\nF.3d 1033, 1037-38 (9th Cir. 2006); Fasano v. Fed. Reserve Bank of\n\nN.Y., 457 F.3d 274, 289 (3d Cir. 2006); Corr v. MTA Long Island\n\nBus, 199 F.3d 1321, 1999 WL 980960, at *2 (2d Cir. Oct. 7, 1999)\n\n(unpublished); Butler v. City of Prairie Vill., 172 F.3d 736, 744\n\n(10th Cir. 1999); EEOC v. AIC Sec. Investigations, Ltd., 55 F.3d\n\n1276, 1282 (7th Cir. 1995).     In addition, Vélez and Renta assert\n\nthat such a conclusion is the logical extension of our holding that\n\nTitle VII, an analogous statute, does not support personal capacity\n\nclaims.   See Fantini v. Salem State Coll., 557 F.3d 22, 31 (1st\n\nCir. 2009).\n\n          We agree that the logic of Fantini is compelling here.\n\nAs other courts have observed, \"[t]he statutory scheme and language\n\nof [Title I of] the ADA and Title VII are identical in many\n\nrespects.\"    Walsh,   471 F.3d at 1038; see also, e.g., AIC, 55 F.3d\n\nat   1279-80.     Both    statutes    direct   their   prohibitions   to\n\n\n\n\n     11\n       As Vélez and Renta note, we previously declined to reach the\nissue while noting that other circuits, as well as district courts\nwithin this circuit, have held that individuals are not subject to\nsuit under the ADA. See Acevedo López v. Police Dep't of P.R., 247\nF.3d 26, 29 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                   -16-\n\f\"employer[s],\"12 and the ADA's definition of employer mirrors Title\n\nVII's. Under both, an employer is \"a person engaged in an industry\n\naffecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees . . . and any\n\nagent of such . . . person.\"        42 U.S.C. § 12111(5)(A) (ADA); see\n\nalso id. at § 2000e(b) (Title VII).\n\n            In Fantini, we recognized that Title VII's exemption for\n\nsmall employers signified an intention not \"'to burden small\n\nentities with the costs associated with litigating discrimination\n\nclaims.'\"   557 F.3d at 29 (quoting Miller v. Maxwell's Int'l Inc.,\n\n991 F.2d 583, 587 (9th Cir. 1993)).         We quoted the Ninth Circuit's\n\nobservation that \"'[i]f Congress decided to protect small entities\n\nwith limited resources from liability, it is inconceivable that\n\nCongress    intended   to   allow   civil    liability   to   run   against\n\nindividual employees.'\"      Id. (quoting Miller, 991 F.2d at 587).\n\nHence, we accepted that the statutory reference to \"any agent\" in\n\nthe definition of \"employer\" does not connote individual liability,\n\nbut \"'simply . . . establish[es] a limit on an employer's liability\n\nfor its employees' actions.'\"        Fantini, 557 F.3d at 30 (quoting\n\nLissau v. S. Food Serv., Inc., 159 F.3d 177, 180 (4th Cir. 1998));\n\nsee also Mason v. Stallings, 82 F.3d 1007, 1009 (11th Cir. 1996)\n\n\n     12\n        The ADA prohibits discriminatory conduct by a \"covered\nentity,\" 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a), and provides that \"[t]he term\n'covered entity' means an employer, employment agency, labor\norganization, or joint labor-management committee,\" id. at\n§ 12111(2).    Title VII states, inter alia, that specified\ndiscriminatory practices are unlawful \"for an employer.\"    42\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(a).\n\n                                    -17-\n\f(noting      that   \"the    'agent'    language     was   included   to   ensure\n\nrespondeat superior liability of the employer for the acts of its\n\nagents\").\n\n              We also relied on precedent noting that changes to Title\n\nVII's remedial scheme enacted in 1991 – applicable to the ADA as\n\nwell – bolstered the conclusion that individuals are not liable\n\nunder the statutes.             Fantini, 557 F.3d at 31; see 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1981a.      Previously, the ordinary remedies available under Title\n\nVII   were     limited     to   back   pay    and   equitable   relief,   which\n\n\"'\"typically are only obtainable from an employing entity, not from\n\na mere individual.\"'\" Fantini, 557 F.3d at 31 (quoting Lissau, 159\n\nF.3d at 181 (quoting AIC, 55 F.3d at 1281)).              The 1991 amendments\n\nadded compensatory and punitive damages calibrated to the size of\n\nthe employer.       The \"sliding scale of liability,\" which ranges from\n\na maximum of $50,000 for companies that employ up to one hundred\n\nworkers and a maximum of $300,000 for companies that employ more\n\nthan 500 employees, 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(3), \"does not stipulate an\n\namount in cases where a plaintiff seeks to hold an individual\n\nsupervisor liable.\"        Lissau, 159 F.3d at 181.        Thus, we concluded\n\nthat neither the original remedial scheme nor the amendments\n\ncontemplated individual liability. See Fantini, 557 F.3d at 30-31;\n\nsee also AIC, 55 F.3d at 1281; Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours\n\n& Co., 100 F.3d 1061, 1077 (3d Cir. 1996) (en banc) (noting that\n\nCongress's failure to state \"the amount of damages, if any, that\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fwould be payable by individuals . . . strongly suggests that [it]\n\ndid not contemplate that such damages would be assessed against\n\nindividuals who are not themselves the employing entity\").\n\n            We see no basis for reaching a different outcome under\n\nTitle I of the ADA.       Indeed, given the parallel statutory language\n\nand   the   identical     1991    amendment      to   the   statutes'      remedial\n\nprovisions, we think it apparent that Congress intended that these\n\ntwo employment discrimination provisions be treated uniformly.                  We\n\nthus agree with the virtually universal view that Title I of the\n\nADA, like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, \"'addresses the\n\nconduct of employers only and does not impose liability on co-\n\nworkers.'\"    Fantini, 557 F.3d at 31 (quoting Powell v. Yellow Book\n\nU.S.A., Inc., 445 F.3d 1074, 1079 (8th Cir. 2006)).                   Hence, the\n\nclaims against Vélez and Renta were properly dismissed.\n\n                                      III.\n\n            For   the    reasons    we    have    discussed,    we    affirm   the\n\ndismissal of Román's claims under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\n\nand we also affirm dismissal of the ADA claims against appellees\n\nVélez and Renta.        Román has waived any challenge to the dismissal\n\nof his hostile environment claim.               We vacate the portion of the\n\ndistrict court's order dismissing the Title I ADA claim against\n\nPREPA.      Likewise,      we    vacate   the    dismissal     of    the   pendent\n\nCommonwealth claims, which the district court declined to hear in\n\nthe absence of any surviving federal claims.\n\n            So ordered.

Appellant Héctor Luis Román-\n\nOliveras (\"Román\") claims that he was an exemplary employee at the\n\nPuerto Rico Electric Power Authority (\"the Authority\" or \"PREPA\")\n\nfor more than two decades despite suffering from schizophrenia\n\nthroughout the period of his employment.          In this action against\n\nthe Authority and two PREPA supervisors, he alleges that he was\n\ninexplicably removed from his job in 2006, required to undergo\n\nmultiple medical evaluations, and prevented from resuming his\n\nduties even though each evaluation pronounced him fit to work.\n\nRomán brought this action against the Authority and two PREPA\n\nsupervisors under federal and Commonwealth law, alleging violation\n\nof his civil rights and unlawful discrimination on the basis of his\n\nmedical condition.1 The district court dismissed Román's complaint\n\nin its entirety.     It discerned no basis for relief under federal\n\nlaw   and,   accordingly,     declined    to   address   the    supplemental\n\nCommonwealth claims.\n\n             Although we affirm the district court's rulings on most\n\nof Román's claims, we vacate the dismissal of his claim against his\n\nemployer under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") because\n\nthe   complaint   plausibly    depicts    discrimination       based   on   the\n\nperception that Román is disabled.

On April 24, the social worker received the psychiatric\n\nreport, which stated that Román could resume his duties.                   On May\n\n23, PREPA \"formally acknowledge[d]\" the psychiatrist's report and\n\nrecommendation.          Román,      however,     remained     out    of    work,\n\ninvoluntarily, despite the satisfactory report.

The resulting report stated that Román was \"fit for duties\n\nincluding as per his psychiatric condition.\"\n\n            Although PREPA's physicians recommended on October 17\n\nthat Román return to work, and he repeatedly asked to return,\n\ndefendant   Renta     requested   additional   medical   evaluations     on\n\nNovember 13 and referred Román for an involuntary medical leave.\n\nRomán also was asked for the evaluations of his private doctors.\n\nIn January 2007, he submitted the requested medical certification\n\nfrom his psychiatrist.     Despite findings by \"[a]ll of the doctors\"\n\nthat Román was capable of resuming his work, defendants again\n\nrefused to allow him to do so, \"changing the entire process of the\n\nreinstallation of plaintff[']s duties.\"\n\n            Román was taken off PREPA's payroll in February 2007.\n\nAlthough he alleges that he was terminated, he submitted an\n\nemployment certification in Spanish to the district court that,\n\naccording to the court, \"reflects that Román had been on medical\n\nleave, without pay, since February 10, 2007.\"            The defendants\n\npresented a translated employment certification stating that, as of\n\nSeptember 5, 2007, Román remained a PREPA employee \"hold[ing] the\n\nregular position of Central Power Plant Electrician II.\"               The\n\ncomplaint alleges, however, that Renta and Vélez ordered removal of\n\nRomán's personal items from the work area, removal of his name\n\nfrom his    locker,    and reassignment   of   his   toolbox   to   another\n\nemployee.\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f          Román filed a timely complaint with the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission and subsequently filed this action, alleging\n\nviolations of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213;5 Title VII of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to 2000e-17; the civil\n\nrights provision codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and Articles 1802\n\nand 1803 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, §§\n\n5141, 5142. He alleged that defendants' actions violated his civil\n\nrights, created a hostile work environment, and subjected him to\n\n\"adverse actions because of his medical condition and active\n\nparticipation with the Union.\"\n\n          Defendants moved for dismissal and, after an exchange of\n\nupdated pleadings, the district court dismissed with prejudice each\n\nof the federal claims in plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint. The\n\ncourt concluded that the hostile work environment claim was time-\n\nbarred, that Román failed to allege facts showing that he was\n\ndisabled within the meaning of the ADA, and that he had alleged\n\n\"neither . . . a specific violation of federal law nor any\n\nindependent facts\" to support his section 1983 claim.    Given the\n\ndeficiencies in the federal causes of action, the court declined to\n\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over the associated Commonwealth\n\nclaims and dismissed them without prejudice.\n\n\n\n     5\n       The complaint did not specify the title of the ADA under\nwhich suit was brought, but the district court accepted the Title\nI characterization adopted in plaintiff's opposition to defendants'\nmotion to dismiss. We do likewise.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f           On appeal, appellant continues to press his ADA and\n\nsection 1983 claims, but implicitly in his brief and explicitly at\n\noral argument conceded the inadequacy of the complaint's Title VII\n\nallegations.

We agree that the complaint\n\nfalls short on the first two alternatives.

Indeed, the thrust of appellant's\n\ncomplaint is that he was fully capable of working, but was unfairly\n\ndenied the opportunity to do so \"because of his medical condition.\"\n\nHe thus has not stated a claim of disability discrimination based\n\non the condition of schizophrenia itself.\n\n           For a similar reason, the district court correctly found\n\nthat Román's complaint failed to satisfy the \"record of impairment\"\n\nprong of the disability definition.                  The \"record\" provision is\n\ndesigned \"to protect those who have recovered or are recovering\n\nfrom substantially limiting impairments from discrimination based\n\non their medical history.\"              Bailey, 306 F.3d at 1169.            Thus, to\n\nqualify for ADA coverage on the basis of this provision, Román\n\nwould   need   to   show    that       in    the   past    he   had,   \"or   has   been\n\nmisclassified as having, an impairment that substantially limited\n\na major life activity.\"          Id.

Despite favorable test results\n\neach time, defendants persisted in refusing to allow Román to work.\n\n\n\n     10\n       Appellees assert that Román failed to argue in his brief on\nappeal that he was disabled under the \"regarded as\" prong and has\nthus waived that issue. Although Román's entire brief is barely\nadequate, we do not consider the claim waived. In addition, we see\nno prejudice in reaching the issue; the district court addressed it\non the merits, as did appellees in their appellate briefing.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f            Taken as true, these allegations, together with the\n\nallegation that Román always performed his job well, readily\n\nsupport three      pertinent   inferences:      (1)    defendants   mistakenly\n\nbelieved that Román's psychiatric condition substantially limited\n\nhis ability to do his job; (2) they refused to let him work based\n\non that erroneous, discriminatory judgment; and (3) they repeatedly\n\nattempted    to    justify   removing   him    from    his   job   through   the\n\npsychiatric and other medical testing. To state a violation of the\n\nADA when the major life activity at issue is working, however,\n\nRomán must show \"'not only that the employer thought that he was\n\nimpaired in his ability to do the job that he held, but also that\n\nthe employer regarded him as substantially impaired in \"either a\n\nclass of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as\n\ncompared    with   the   average   person     having   comparable    training,\n\nskills, and abilities.\"'\"          Ruiz Rivera, 521 F.3d at 83 (quoting\n\nSullivan, 358 F.3d at 117 (quoting Murphy v.

According\n\nto the complaint, PREPA removed Román from his position without any\n\nmeaningful effort to offer him alternative positions appropriate\n\nfor whatever limitations his employer attributed to him.                 Román\n\nalleges one attempted transfer, but his objections to it – based on\n\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fdenial of food and travel allowance – suggest it was a temporary\n\nrelocation rather than reassignment to a new position deemed more\n\nsuitable   for    his   abilities.     In   any    event,   given   that   the\n\ndisability at issue is a mental condition rather than a discrete\n\nphysical limitation, defendants' actions in removing Román and\n\nrepeatedly demanding psychiatric evaluations permit the inference\n\nthat defendants deemed him disqualified from a broad range of jobs.\n\nCf.

Here, the\n\npleaded facts support \"[a] plausible but inconclusive inference\" of\n\ndiscrimination based on disability, Sepúlveda-Villarini, 628 F.3d\n\nat 30, and Román is therefore entitled to proceed with his ADA\n\nclaim.\n\nC.

They acknowledge that\n\nneither we nor the Supreme Court has explicitly rejected individual\n\nliability under the ADA, but point out that a number of other\n\ncircuits have taken that view.11     See Albra v.

(quoting Miller, 991 F.2d at 587).\n\nHence, we accepted that the statutory reference to \"any agent\" in\n\nthe definition of \"employer\" does not connote individual liability,\n\nbut \"'simply . . . establish[es] a limit on an employer's liability\n\nfor its employees' actions.'\"        Fantini, 557 F.3d at 30 (quoting\n\nLissau v.

Title VII states, inter alia, that specified\ndiscriminatory practices are unlawful \"for an employer.\"    42\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(a).\n\n                                    -17-\n\f(noting      that   \"the    'agent'    language     was   included   to   ensure\n\nrespondeat superior liability of the employer for the acts of its\n\nagents\").\n\n              We also relied on precedent noting that changes to Title\n\nVII's remedial scheme enacted in 1991 – applicable to the ADA as\n\nwell – bolstered the conclusion that individuals are not liable\n\nunder the statutes.             Fantini, 557 F.3d at 31; see 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1981a.      Previously, the ordinary remedies available under Title\n\nVII   were     limited     to   back   pay    and   equitable   relief,   which\n\n\"'\"typically are only obtainable from an employing entity, not from\n\na mere individual.\"'\" Fantini, 557 F.3d at 31 (quoting Lissau, 159\n\nF.3d at 181 (quoting AIC, 55 F.3d at 1281)).              The 1991 amendments\n\nadded compensatory and punitive damages calibrated to the size of\n\nthe employer.       The \"sliding scale of liability,\" which ranges from\n\na maximum of $50,000 for companies that employ up to one hundred\n\nworkers and a maximum of $300,000 for companies that employ more\n\nthan 500 employees, 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(3), \"does not stipulate an\n\namount in cases where a plaintiff seeks to hold an individual\n\nsupervisor liable.\"        Lissau, 159 F.3d at 181.        Thus, we concluded\n\nthat neither the original remedial scheme nor the amendments\n\ncontemplated individual liability. See Fantini, 557 F.3d at 30-31;\n\nsee also AIC, 55 F.3d at 1281; Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours\n\n& Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729752\"><a href=\"/opinion/729752/barbara-r-sheridan-v-ei-dupont-de-nemours-and-company-jacques-amblard/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1061</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1077 (3d Cir. 1996) (en banc) (noting that\n\nCongress's failure to state \"the amount of damages, if any, that\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fwould be payable by individuals . . . strongly suggests that [it]\n\ndid not contemplate that such damages would be assessed against\n\nindividuals who are not themselves the employing entity\").\n\n            We see no basis for reaching a different outcome under\n\nTitle I of the ADA.       Indeed, given the parallel statutory language\n\nand   the   identical     1991    amendment      to   the   statutes'      remedial\n\nprovisions, we think it apparent that Congress intended that these\n\ntwo employment discrimination provisions be treated uniformly.                  We\n\nthus agree with the virtually universal view that Title I of the\n\nADA, like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, \"'addresses the\n\nconduct of employers only and does not impose liability on co-\n\nworkers.'\"    Fantini, 557 F.3d at 31 (quoting Powell v.
