BACHIER-ORTIZ, ET AL.,\n\n                     Plaintiffs, Appellants,\n\n                                v.\n\n                 HECTOR L. COLON-MENDOZA, ET AL.,\n\n                      Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n         [Hon. José Antonio Fusté,     U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                     Selya, Lipez and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Francisco R. Gonzalez on brief for appellants.\n     Eileen Landron Guardiola, Eduardo A. Vera Ramirez and Landron\n& Vera, Francisco L. Acevedo Nogueras and Acevedo Nogueras & Pagan,\non brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                          June 12, 2003\n\f      Per Curiam.        Plaintiff-appellant Irma Bachier-Ortiz brings\n\nthis appeal from the summary dismissal of her action pursuant to 42\n\nU.S.C. §1983 against Hector L. Colon-Mendoza, mayor of Guayama,\n\nvarious other individuals, and the Municipality of Guayama.                  The\n\ndistrict court summarily dismissed her case after her counsel\n\nfailed (a) to meet with opposing counsel to draft a proposed\n\npretrial order, and (b) to attend the pretrial conference. Counsel\n\nmade a timely motion for reconsideration, stating that human error\n\nin calendar-keeping led to his being unaware of the dates for the\n\nmeeting and conference, and, as a result, that he had been out of\n\nPuerto Rico for follow-up cancer treatment and for his son's\n\ngraduation from college.           He requested that the court employ\n\nsanctions against him rather than the remedy of dismissal.\n\n      We review the district court's dismissal of a case as a\n\nsanction for abuse of discretion. See Velazquez-Rivera v. Sea-Land\n\nServ., Inc., 920 F.2d 1072, 1075 (1st Cir. 1990).                  We do not\n\nlightly disturb a district court's ruling -- but \"dismissal should\n\nnot be viewed either as a sanction of first resort or as an\n\nautomatic penalty for every failure to abide by a court order.\"\n\nYoung v. Gordon, ___F.3d __, __ (1st Cir. 2003) [No. 02-1958, slip.\n\nop. at 8].    When non-compliance occurs, both the nisi prius court\n\nand   the   court   of   appeals   must    look   to   the   totality   of   the\n\ncircumstances.      See id.; see also Tower Ventures, Inc. v. City of\n\nWestfield, 296 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir. 2002).             In all events, we do\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fnot merely rubber-stamp a district court's imposition of the\n\nultimate sanction of dismissal.\n\n      In general, the sanction of dismissal for lack of prosecution\n\nis   appropriate   only   when    plaintiff's       misconduct     is    serious,\n\nrepeated, contumacious, extreme, or otherwise inexcusable.                    See\n\nBatiz Chamorro v. P. R. Cars, Inc., 304 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nWhen a dismissal is based on a pattern of delay or willful\n\nbehavior, this court typically has found no abuse of discretion in\n\na district court's order of dismissal.             See Young, __ F.3d at __\n\n[No. 02-1958 slip op. at 9]; Batiz Chamorro, 304 F.3d at 5; Tower\n\nVentures, 296 F.3d at 46.       But when an isolated incident appears to\n\nhave been the sole basis for the dismissal, we have sometimes\n\nvacated   the   order     (as    long     as    some   plausible    excusatory\n\ncircumstances exist).      E.g. Crossman v. Raytheon Longterm Disab.\n\nPlan, 316 F.3d 36, 39 (1st Cir. 2002); Velazquez-Rivera, 920 F.2d\n\nat 1076-77.\n\n      In this case, the district court gave as its reason for\n\ndismissal only that counsel missed a meeting to draft the proposed\n\npretrial order and the associated pretrial conference.                  The court\n\ndid not question the sincerity of the explanation advanced by\n\nplaintiff's counsel for the lapse.            This case has not, so far as we\n\ncan discern, been marred by any persistent disregard of court\n\norders, deliberate stalling, or repeated nonchalance.                   This case\n\nhas not been unreasonably delayed. By the same token, the opposing\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fparties have not been prejudiced; in fact, they had moved twice for\n\npostponement of the pretrial conference.    We conclude, therefore,\n\nthat Crossman and Velazquez control the result here: counsel's\n\nsingle, negligent failure to calendar the pretrial order deadline\n\nand the associated pretrial conference does not sink to a level of\n\nbehavior warranting the ultimate sanction of dismissal.\n\n     We need go no further.    In light of the foregoing, we grant\n\nthe appellees' motion to submit this case for decision without oral\n\nargument.   See 1st Cir. R. 34.    We summarily vacate the order of\n\ndismissal and remand to the district court for further proceedings.\n\nWe envision that the district court, in its discretion, may impose\n\nsome lesser sanction on the plaintiff or on her attorney in lieu of\n\nthe vacated dismissal.\n\n     Vacated and remanded.    No costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
