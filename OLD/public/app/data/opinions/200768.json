Ronald R. Lagueux, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Nickoyan Wallace on brief pro se.\n     Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Donald C.\nLockhart, Assistant U.S. Attorney on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          December 11, 2003\n\f          Per   Curiam.    Nickoyan       Wallace    has   appealed     the\n\ndistrict court's denial of his pro se motion, filed during the\n\npendency of his direct criminal appeal, that was purported to\n\nbe filed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) and sought to vacate\n\nhis criminal conviction.      Neither the district court nor the\n\ngovernment remarked on the obvious proposition that Rule 60(b)\n\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is an inappropriate\n\nprocedural vehicle to vacate a criminal conviction.                  In any\n\nevent, the motion was correctly denied.\n\n          Wallace    contends    that    he    was   not   present     at   a\n\ndiscussion that occurred during trial among the trial court,\n\ngovernment counsel and his own defense counsel.            Even assuming\n\nthat Wallace was not present, Wallace points to the inference\n\nin the record of this discussion, but then proffers nothing\n\n(for example,   an   affidavit    of     his   counsel)    to   rebut   the\n\ngovernment's    explanation      (also     record-based)        that    the\n\ndiscussion concerned the taking of a recess in order to get\n\nWillie Preston, an incarcerated government witness, into the\n\ncourtroom and Preston's restraints removed without Preston's\n\nrestraints being seen by the jury.         We are thus left with this\n\nunrebutted conclusion regarding the substance of the prior\n\ndiscussion.\n\n          \"[A] defendant is guaranteed the right to be present\n\nat any stage of the criminal proceeding that is critical to its\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\foutcome if his presence would contribute to the fairness of the\n\nprocedure.\" Kentucky v. Stincer, 482 U.S. 730, 745 (1987). He\n\nhas   a   right   to   be   present    \"whenever    his     presence     has   a\n\nrelation,    reasonably      substantial,     to    the    fulness      of   his\n\nopportunity to defend against the charge\" and \"to the extent\n\nthat a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by his absence.\"\n\nSnyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 105-06, 108 (1934).\n\nWallace's attendance at the discussion concerning the use of a\n\nrecess to bring Preston into the courtroom had no reasonably\n\nsubstantial relation to the fullness of his opportunity to\n\ndefend against the criminal charges of robbery of a gun shop\n\nand related firearms offenses and a fair and just hearing on\n\nthose charges was not thwarted by his absence.                   See United\n\nStates v. Oles, 994 F.2d 1519, 1525 (10th Cir. 1993) (defendant\n\nfailed to establish that his presence at an administrative\n\nconference, at which potential retained counsel informed court\n\nthat he would not be representing defendant, would contribute\n\nto the fairness of the overall proceeding and defendant's\n\nabsence from this conference did not impinge on defendant's\n\nopportunity to defend against criminal charge); United States\n\nv.    Shukitis,    877      F.2d    1322,   1329-30       (7th   Cir.     1989)\n\n(defendant's      presence     at     conferences     concerning        alleged\n\nviolations of court's witness sequestration order would not\n\nhave aided the court in its determination of any violation and\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fhis absence did not affect his ability to defend against the\n\ncriminal drug charges).\n\n          Wallace's remaining claims of error in the admission\n\nof Preston's testimony are meritless. His claim of a violation\n\nof the mandate of Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201\n\n(1964), was adjudicated adversely to him in his direct criminal\n\nappeal and may not be relitigated.         See United States v.\n\nWallace, 71 Fed. Appx. 868, 2003 WL 21982022 (1st Cir. Aug. 21,\n\n2003) (unpublished).     And, his claim of error in the admission\n\nof Preston's testimony as a result of judicial bias is patently\n\nfrivolous.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f",
