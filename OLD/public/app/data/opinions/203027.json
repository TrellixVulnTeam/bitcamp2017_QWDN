Plaintiff-Appellant\n\nThomas W.

Cash contends Boston Harley failed to pay him overtime\n\nat the proper rate in violation of both the Fair Labor Standards\n\nAct, 29 U.S.C. §§ 210–19 (2004), and the Massachusetts Minimum Fair\n\nWages Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151, §§ 1A, 1B (2004).            The district\n\ncourt   granted     Boston   Harley’s     motion   for    summary      judgment,\n\nconcluding that Cash was an exempt “administrative” employee within\n\nthe meaning of these Acts.          Cash v. Cycle Craft Co., 482 F. Supp.\n\n2d 133 (D. Mass. 2007).       We AFFIRM.\n\n                               I.    BACKGROUND\n\n            We review the facts in the light most favorable to Cash,\n\nthe nonmoving party below.\n\n            In fall 2003, Cash was shopping at the Boston Harley\n\nmotorcycle store and met the General Manager, Ron Buchbaum.                This\n\nencounter, along with another in January 2004, led to discussions\n\nof Cash potentially working at Boston Harley. Buchbaum wanted Cash\n\nto create a new customer-service position.               Cash drafted a job\n\ndescription for the position and Buchbaum suggested some changes,\n\nwhich Cash adopted.      The job description titled the position “New\n\nPurchase/Customer Relations Manager” and identified the following\n\nresponsibilities:\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f           The ability to develop and implement a[n]\n           overall Customer Service strategic plan that\n           will allow [Boston Harley] to reach its\n           current and long-term customer satisfaction\n           goals.\n\n           The ability to develop a clear business plan\n           to support organizational changes, where\n           needed, that provide efficiency and improve\n           customer service delivery.\n\n           To ensure service goals and expectations of\n           customers are met with optimum quality and\n           satisfaction.\n\n           Identify and expeditiously resolve delivery\n           problems. Develop and implement appropriate\n           action.\n\n           Liason between National representatives, the\n           Dealership and the customer, resolving issues\n           to assure complete and on-time shipment of\n           bike and accessories delivery.\n\nThe job description also stated the position’s qualifications,\n\nincluding a “[m]inimum of five years experience” in both “Customer\n\nService Management” and “as a Supervisor.”    Buchbaum offered Cash\n\nthe position, which provided a $60,000 annual salary, along with\n\nhealth insurance and vacation after one year.\n\n           Cash accepted the offer and started working at Boston\n\nHarley on April 26, 2004. His duties included working with various\n\nBoston Harley departments to make sure that they outfitted and\n\ndelivered each motorcycle according to the particular purchase\n\norder.   If ordered parts were not installed, he was to contact the\n\nservice manager, Michael Sienkiewicz, and tell him what needed to\n\nbe done.   Once problems were resolved, Cash was to tell the finance\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fdepartment that the motorcycle was ready.               That department would\n\nthen set up a time with the customer for delivery or pickup.               Cash\n\nthen tracked the purchased motorcycles; it was his job to stay in\n\ntouch with the customers and make sure that they were satisfied so\n\nthat they would provide positive customer-feedback reports.\n\n            As   Cash’s   job   worked      out,   he    did   not   coordinate\n\nmotorcycle ordering, delivery, or part installation.                 Nor did he\n\nsupervise or manage any employees. However, he attended management\n\nmeetings, except when Buchbaum instructed him not to.                 At these\n\nmeetings,    Cash   reported    the      status    of    previously     ordered\n\nmotorcycles and their scheduled time for pickup or delivery.\n\nOften, after Cash provided these reports, Buchbaum told him to\n\nleave the meeting.\n\n            Cash earned $1,153.85 per week (the prorated amount for\n\nhis $60,000 salary) during his employment.              He received this same\n\nsalary each week regardless of hours worked, except for two pay\n\nperiods: (1) the pay period ending August 28, 2004, when he was\n\npaid $769.24; and (2) the next pay period, ending September 4,\n\n2004, when he was paid $961.55.             Cash states that “he was never\n\npaid for hours he worked over 40 hours [per week], yet he was\n\nroutinely required to work overtime as part of his job, as is\n\nreflected in his payroll records.”\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            On April 8, 2005, almost one year after he started\n\nworking at Boston Harley, Cash experienced an emotional problem at\n\nwork.   Boston Harley terminated his employment that day.\n\n            On November 4, 2005, Cash brought suit in district court,\n\nalleging the statutory violations mentioned above.        On April 6,\n\n2007, the district court granted Boston Harley’s motion for summary\n\njudgment.    Cash appealed.\n\n                              II.   DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n            We review de novo a district court’s entry of summary\n\njudgment.   Dávila v. Corporación De P.R. Para La Difusión Pública,\n\n498 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2007).       Like the district court, we take\n\nthe facts of record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant\n\n(here, Cash) and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.      Id.\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate only when the record “show[s] that\n\nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”      Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(c).\n\nB.   Cash’s Claims\n\n            1.   Fair Labor Standards Act\n\n            The Fair Labor Standards Act establishes the general rule\n\nthat employers must compensate each employee at “a rate not less\n\nthan one and one-half times the regular rate” for all overtime\n\nhours that an employee works.         29 U.S.C. § 207(a)(1).   The Act\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fdefines overtime as employment in excess of 40 hours in a single\n\nworkweek.     Id.\n\n             The Act exempts from this general rule certain so-called\n\n“white-collar” employees, i.e., “any employee employed in a bona\n\nfide executive, administrative, or professional capacity . . . .”\n\nId. § 213(a)(1) (emphasis added). Boston Harley contends that Cash\n\nwas   such   a     “white-collar”       employee      because     he   served    in   an\n\n“administrative” capacity.\n\n             An employer defending a suit under the Act bears the\n\nburden of establishing that a particular employee’s job falls\n\nwithin such an exemption.          Reich v. John Alden Life Ins. Co., 126\n\nF.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1997).             Additionally, “the remedial nature of\n\nthe statute requires that [its] exemptions be ‘narrowly construed\n\nagainst the employers seeking to assert them’” and “‘limited to\n\nthose   establishments        plainly       and    unmistakably         within    [the\n\nexemptions’] terms and spirit.’”                  Id. (quoting Arnold v. Ben\n\nKanowsky, Inc., 361 U.S. 388, 392 (1960)).\n\n             The    Secretary     of    Labor   has    issued     regulations     that\n\narticulate some specific parameters of the exemption.                     John Alden,\n\n126 F.3d at 7; see 29 C.F.R. § 541.200 (2004).                          Although the\n\nregulations merely state the Secretary’s official position on how\n\nthe   statutes      should   be   interpreted,        a   court    must    give   them\n\n“controlling weight unless [the court finds them] to be arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or contrary to the statute.”                  John Alden, 126 F.3d at\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f8 (citing Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 467\n\nU.S. 837, 843–44 (1984)).\n\n          According to the regulations, to establish that Cash was\n\nan “employee in a bona fide administrative capacity,” Boston Harley\n\nmust show that he was an employee\n\n          (1)    [c]ompensated on a salary or fee basis\n                 at a rate of not less than $455 per\n                 week . . ., exclusive of board, lodging\n                 or other facilities;\n\n          (2)    [w]hose primary duty is the performance\n                 of office or non-manual work directly\n                 related to the management or general\n                 business operations of the employer or\n                 the employer’s customers; and\n\n          (3)    [w]hose    primary    duty   includes   the\n                 exercise of discretion and independent\n                 judgment with respect to matters of\n                 significance.\n\n\n29 C.F.R. § 541.200 (emphasis added).1\n\n                 (a)   Salary\n\n          Cash meets the $455-per-week compensation threshold in\n\nthe regulation: he received $1,153.83 per week, except for the two\n\nweeks he received $769.24 and $961.55.        He argues, however, that\n\nBoston Harley did not pay him on a “salary basis,” because it\n\n\n     1\n      The Secretary issued these regulations during the course of\nCash’s tenure with Boston Harley; because the changes are largely\nstylistic, we do not refer to the old regulations.\n\n                                 -7-\n\freduced his pay for these two pay periods.              The regulations state\n\nthat “[a]n employee will be considered to be paid on a ‘salary\n\nbasis’. . . if the employee regularly receives each pay period on\n\na   weekly,    or   less   frequent[,]     basis,   a   predetermined     amount\n\nconstituting all or part of the employee’s compensation, which\n\namount is not subject to reduction because of variations in the\n\nquality or quantity of the work performed.”                   Id. § 541.602(a).\n\nSubject to certain exceptions, “an exempt employee must receive the\n\nfull salary for any week in which the employee performs any work\n\nwithout regard to the number of days or hours worked.”                  Id.    The\n\ndistrict      court,   mistakenly   stating    that     Cash    began   work    on\n\nThursday, August 26, 2004 (instead of April 26, 2004), concluded\n\nthat these two pay periods accurately reflected the 1.5 weeks Cash\n\nworked at this time.\n\n              Regardless of this date error, Boston Harley prevails on\n\nthis point.     A regulation issued August 23, 2004, provides that an\n\nemployer “shall lose the exemption if the facts demonstrate that\n\nthe employer did not intend to pay employees on a salary basis.”\n\nId.   §   541.603(a).       “An   actual    practice     of    making   improper\n\ndeductions demonstrates” this intent.           Id. (emphasis added).           An\n\nactual practice of making improper deductions is evidenced by “the\n\nnumber of improper deductions.”          Id.\n\n              We conclude that two aberrant paychecks out of the\n\napproximately 50 that Cash received do not amount to an “actual\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fpractice.”      See Kennedy v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 410 F.3d 365,\n\n372 (7th Cir. 2005) (“Identifying a few random, isolated, and\n\nnegligible deductions is not enough to show an actual practice or\n\npolicy    of    treating      as   hourly    the    theoretically        salaried.”).\n\nIndeed,   even        Cash   stated   that   he    was   earning     a   “salary”   of\n\n$1,153.85 per week.\n\n               Accordingly, we conclude that Boston Harley paid Cash on\n\na “salary basis.”\n\n                        (b)     Primary duty related to management                  and\n                                includes exercise of discretion\n\n               The next questions are whether Cash’s “primary duty” at\n\nBoston Harley (a) “was the performance of office or non-manual work\n\ndirectly related to management or general business operations of\n\n[Boston Harley] or its customers,” and (b) “include[d] the exercise\n\nof discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of\n\nsignificance.”         29 C.F.R. § 541.200.\n\n               “The term ‘primary duty’ means the principal, main, major\n\nor most important duty that the employee performs.”                  Id. § 541.700.\n\n“Determination of an employee’s primary duty must be based on all\n\nthe facts in a particular case, with the major emphasis on the\n\ncharacter of the employee’s job as a whole.”                   Id.\n\n               “The    phrase    ‘directly     related    to   the   management     or\n\ngeneral business operations’” in the exemption’s second requirement\n\n“refers to the type of work performed by the employee.”                             Id.\n\n§ 541.201(a).         “To meet this requirement, an employee must perform\n\n                                         -9-\n\fwork directly related to assisting with the running or servicing of\n\nthe business, as distinguished, for example, from working on a\n\nmanufacturing production line or selling a product in a retail or\n\nservice establishment.”     Id.     “Work directly related to management\n\nor general business operations includes work in functional areas\n\nsuch as finance, quality control, and personnel management.”                Id.\n\n§ 541.201(b).\n\n             In general, “the exercise of discretion and independent\n\njudgment,” i.e., the exemption’s third requirement, “involves the\n\ncomparison and the evaluation of possible courses of conduct, and\n\nacting or making a decision after the various possibilities have\n\nbeen considered.”       Id. § 541.202(a).             “The term ‘matters of\n\nsignificance,’” to which that discretion must apply, “refers to the\n\nlevel of importance or consequence of the work performed.”               Id.\n\n             Regulation 29 C.F.R. § 541.203 provides examples of\n\nemployees who “generally meet the duties requirements for the\n\nadministrative      exemption.”      For    instance,     employees    in   the\n\nfinancial-services industry are generally exempt “if their duties\n\ninclude work such as collecting and analyzing information regarding\n\nthe customer’s income, assets, investments or debts; determining\n\nwhich   financial    products     best   meet   the    customer’s   needs   and\n\nfinancial    circumstances;     advising      the   customer   regarding    the\n\nadvantages and disadvantages of different financial products; and\n\nmarketing,     servicing   or     promoting     the    employer’s     financial\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fproducts.”         Id. § 541.203(b).             On the other hand, a financial-\n\nservices employee “whose primary duty is selling financial products\n\ndoes    not    qualify       for      the   administrative        exemption.”          Id.\n\n“Similarly, human-resources managers who formulate, interpret, or\n\nimplement          employment        policies      generally      meet     the      duties\n\nrequirements for the exemption, but personnel clerks who merely\n\n‘screen’      applicants        to      obtain    data    regarding      their    minimum\n\nqualifications generally do not meet the duties requirements.” Id.\n\n§ 541.203(e).\n\n              The caselaw is consistent with these examples.                      In John\n\nAlden we affirmed a district court’s grant of summary judgment in\n\nfavor of a life-insurance company, concluding that the company’s\n\nmarketing representatives—who worked with outside agents to sell\n\ninsurance      policies      to    customers—fell        under   the     administrative\n\nexemption.         126 F.3d at 3.        The first (“salary basis”) requirement\n\nwas    not    at    issue.        The    Court     explained     that    the     marketing\n\nrepresentatives’ duties met the second (“management”) requirement\n\nbecause they were “engaged in something more than routine selling\n\nefforts focused simply on particular sales transactions.”                          Id. at\n\n10    (internal quotation marks omitted).                      “Rather, their agent\n\ncontacts [were] aimed at promoting (i.e., increasing, developing,\n\nfacilitating, and/or maintaining) customer sales generally.”                          Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).                      Their duties also met the\n\nthird (“discretion”) requirement: they had “discretion in choosing\n\n\n                                            -11-\n\fwhich agents to contact on any given day, and concerning which\n\nproducts to discuss with each agent.”                Id. at 13.       “In addition,\n\nthe marketing representatives rel[ied] on their own knowledge of an\n\nagent’s business to help tailor proposals for the agent’s end-\n\ncustomers.”            Id.   “[T]he content of a given conversation with an\n\nagent [was] dictated by the needs or customer base of that agent,\n\nor     by        the   particular    information    sought    by     the   marketing\n\nrepresentative during that phone call.”                 Id. at 14.         The Court\n\ntherefore concluded that the marketing representatives were “not\n\nmerely ‘skilled’ workers who operate[d] within a strict set of\n\nrules,”          rather,     they   exercised   significant   discretion.        Id.\n\nConsequently, the Court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to\n\nthe company.           Id.; cf. Dalheim v. KDFW–TV, 918 F.2d 1220, 1231 (5th\n\nCir. 1990) (holding that television station producers’ jobs did not\n\nfit    into        administrative      exemption   because    they    produced   the\n\nstation’s news-department product and were not involved in the\n\nadministrative operations).\n\n                  In the run-up to his employment, Cash provided Boston\n\nHarley with his conception of the job that he would assume as the\n\n“New Purchases/Customer Relations Manager.”                   He described these\n\nduties as including the following: (i) developing an “overall\n\nCustomer Service strategic plan”; (ii) developing a “clear business\n\nplan        to     support    organizational     changes”;    and    (iii)    taking\n\n“appropriate action” regarding delivery problems.\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\f          On the job, he performed some, but not all, of the\n\nfunctions that his proposed job description anticipated. He worked\n\nwith various Boston Harley departments to ensure that motorcycles\n\nwere properly outfitted and delivered.    If ordered parts were not\n\ninstalled on the motorcycles, Cash instructed the Service Manger\n\nconcerning what needed to be done.    He also was to stay in contact\n\nwith the customers to make sure that they were happy with the\n\nservice they were receiving.   It is reasonable to infer that his\n\nperformance of these duties was infused by his broader pre-job\n\nconception of his responsibilities.\n\n          Cash’s employment at Boston Harley meets the “management”\n\nand “discretion” requirements of the administrative exemption.\n\nFirst, like the marketing representatives in John Alden, Cash was\n\n“engaged in something more than routine selling efforts focused\n\nsimply on particular sales transactions.”   126 F.3d at 10.   Rather,\n\nhe focused on improving customer service generally, by coordinating\n\nwith various Boston Harley departments to ensure that customers\n\nwere satisfied with their purchase and that they would provide\n\nBoston Harley with positive feedback reports.        Cf. 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 541.203(b) (noting that a financial-services representative who\n\n“determin[es] which financial products best meet the customer’s\n\nneeds and financial circumstances” is generally exempt, whereas a\n\nfinancial-services representative who merely “sell[s] financial\n\nproducts” is not).   Second, just as the marketing representatives\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fin John Alden exercised significant discretion by, among other\n\nthings, “fashioning bid proposals that me[t] the needs of the\n\nagent’s customers,” 126 F.3d at 14, Cash exercised discretion in\n\nreacting to the unique needs of Boston Harley’s customers.            Thus,\n\nCash was “not merely [a] ‘skilled’ worker[] who operate[d] within\n\na strict set of rules.”   Id.   Moreover, in return for performing\n\nhis duties, he earned a $60,000 salary, which was greater or equal\n\nto that of all the other managers, except for Buchbaum.              Cash’s\n\nattendance at management meetings, albeit in a limited fashion,\n\nfurther supports his status as a manager.              In sum, Cash did not\n\nsimply produce a product; he exercised independent judgment as he\n\nengaged in the company’s business operations.\n\n                           *        *        *\n\n          Cash meets each of administrative-exemption requirements\n\nunder the Fair Labor Standards Act; Boston Harley therefore is not\n\nliable to pay him overtime wages.\n\n          2.     Massachusetts Minimum Fair Wages Act\n          The Massachusetts statute governing overtime pay mirrors\n\nthe Fair Labor Standards Act.    It states, in relevant part, that\n\n“[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this section, no employer in the\n\ncommonwealth   shall   employ   any     of       his     employees   in   an\n\noccupation . . . for a work week longer than forty hours, unless\n\nsuch employee receives compensation for his employment . . . in\n\nexcess of forty hours at a rate not less than one and one half\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\ftimes the regular rate at which he is employed.”             Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 151, § 1A.     The statute also provides for an exception where an\n\nemployee is employed “as a bona fide executive, or administrative\n\nor professional person . . . earning more than eighty dollars per\n\nweek.”   Id. § 1A(3).\n\n            The    “basic   overtime     provision   of   the   Massachusetts\n\nstatute is essentially identical to the [Fair Labor Standards\n\nAct].”   Valerio v. Putnam Assocs. Inc., 173 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir.\n\n1999); accord McLaughlin v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 224 F.R.D. 295,\n\n296 (D. Mass. 2004) (referring to the filing of both claims as\n\n“[r]iding   that    same    horse”).     The   Supreme    Judicial   Court   of\n\nMassachusetts agrees with this view.           See Swift v.

CONCLUSION\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Boston Harley is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\f",

Cash appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment to his former employer, Defendant-Appellee Cycle Craft Company, Inc., d/b/a Harley-Davidson/Buell of Boston (\"Boston Harley\"). Cash contends Boston Harley failed to pay him overtime at the proper rate in violation of both the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 210-19 (2004), and the Massachusetts Minimum Fair Wages Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151, §§ 1A, 1B (2004). The district court granted Boston Harley's motion for summary judgment, concluding that Cash was an exempt \"administrative\" employee within the meaning of these Acts. <i>Cash v. Cycle Craft Co.,</i> 482 F.Supp.2d 133 (D.Mass. 2007). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We review the facts in the light most favorable to Cash, the nonmoving party below.</p>\n<p>In fall 2003, Cash was shopping at the Boston Harley motorcycle store and met the General Manager, Ron Buchbaum. This encounter, along with another in January 2004, led to discussions of Cash potentially working at Boston Harley. Buchbaum wanted Cash to create a new customer-service position. Cash drafted a job description for the position and Buchbaum suggested some changes, which Cash adopted. The job description titled the position \"New Purchase/Customer Relations Manager\" and identified the following responsibilities:</p>\n<blockquote>The ability to develop and implement a[n] overall Customer Service strategic plan that will allow [Boston Harley] to reach its current and long-term customer satisfaction goals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The ability to develop a clear business plan to support organizational changes, where needed, that provide efficiency and improve customer service delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>To ensure service goals and expectations of customers are met with optimum quality and satisfaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Identify and expeditiously resolve delivery problems. Develop and implement appropriate action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Liason between National representatives, the Dealership and the customer, resolving issues to assure complete and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*682</span> on-time shipment of bike and accessories delivery.</blockquote>\n<p>The job description also stated the position's qualifications, including a \"[m]inimum of five years experience\" in both \"Customer Service Management\" and \"as a Supervisor.\" Buchbaum offered Cash the position, which provided a $60,000 annual salary, along with health insurance and vacation after one year.</p>\n<p>Cash accepted the offer and started working at Boston Harley on April 26, 2004. His duties included working with various Boston Harley departments to make sure that they outfitted and delivered each motorcycle according to the particular purchase order. If ordered parts were not installed, he was to contact the service manager, Michael Sienkiewicz, and tell him what needed to be done. Once problems were resolved, Cash was to tell the finance department that the motorcycle was ready. That department would then set up a time with the customer for delivery or pickup. Cash then tracked the purchased motorcycles; it was his job to stay in touch with the customers and make sure that they were satisfied so that they would provide positive customer-feedback reports.</p>\n<p>As Cash's job worked out, he did not coordinate motorcycle ordering, delivery, or part installation. Nor did he supervise or manage any employees. However, he attended management meetings, except when Buchbaum instructed him not to. At these meetings, Cash reported the status of previously ordered motorcycles and their scheduled time for pickup or delivery. Often, after Cash provided these reports, Buchbaum told him to leave the meeting.</p>\n<p>Cash earned $1,153.85 per week (the prorated amount for his $60,000 salary) during his employment. He received this same salary each week regardless of hours worked, except for two pay periods: (1) the pay period ending August 28, 2004, when he was paid $769.24; and (2) the next pay period, ending September 4, 2004, when he was paid $961.55. Cash states that \"he was never paid for hours he worked over 40 hours [per week], yet he was routinely required to work overtime as part of his job, as is reflected in his payroll records.\"</p>\n<p>On April 8, 2005, almost one year after he started working at Boston Harley, Cash experienced an emotional problem at work. Boston Harley terminated his employment that day.</p>\n<p>On November 4, 2005, Cash brought suit in district court, alleging the statutory violations mentioned above. On April 6, 2007, the district court granted Boston Harley's motion for summary judgment. Cash appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p>We review de novo a district court's entry of summary judgment. <i>Dávila v. Corporación De P.R. Para La Difusión Pública,</i> 498 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.2007). Like the district court, we take the facts of record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant (here, Cash) and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor. <i>Id.</i> Summary judgment is appropriate only when the record \"show[s] that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p>B. Cash's Claims</p>\n<p>1. Fair Labor Standards Act</p>\n<p>The Fair Labor Standards Act establishes the general rule that employers must compensate each employee at \"a rate not less than one and one-half times the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*683</span> regular rate\" for all overtime hours that an employee works. 29 U.S.C. § 207(a)(1). The Act defines overtime as employment in excess of 40 hours in a single workweek. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The Act exempts from this general rule certain so-called \"white-collar\" employees, i.e., \"any employee employed in a bona fide executive, <i>administrative,</i> or professional capacity. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> § 213(a)(1) (emphasis added). Boston Harley contends that Cash was such a \"white-collar\" employee because he served in an \"administrative\" capacity.</p>\n<p>An employer defending a suit under the Act bears the burden of establishing that a particular employee's job falls within such an exemption. <i>Reich v. John Alden Life Ins. Co.,</i> 126 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1997). Additionally, \"the remedial nature of the statute requires that [its] exemptions be `narrowly construed against the employers seeking to assert them'\" and \"`limited to those establishments plainly and unmistakably within [the exemptions'] terms and spirit.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky, Inc.,</i> 361 U.S. 388, 392, 80 S.Ct. 453, 4 L.Ed.2d 393 (1960)).</p>\n<p>The Secretary of Labor has issued regulations that articulate some specific parameters of the exemption. <i>John Alden,</i> 126 F.3d at 7; <i>see</i> 29 C.F.R. § 541.200 (2004). Although the regulations merely state the Secretary's official position on how the statutes should be interpreted, a court must give them \"controlling weight unless [the court finds them] to be arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to the statute.\" <i>John Alden,</i> 126 F.3d at 8 (citing <i>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)).</p>\n<p>According to the regulations, to establish that Cash was an \"employee in a bona fide administrative capacity,\" Boston Harley must show that he was an employee</p>\n<blockquote>(1) [c]ompensated on a <i>salary or fee basis</i> at a rate of not less than $455 per week . . ., exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) [w]hose primary duty is the performance of office or non-manual work <i>directly related to the management or general business operations</i> of the employer or the employer's customers; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) [w]hose primary duty includes the <i>exercise of discretion and independent judgment</i> with respect to matters of significance.</blockquote>\n<p>29 C.F.R. § 541.200 (emphasis added).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(a) Salary</h2>\n<p>Cash meets the $455-per-week compensation threshold in the regulation: he received $1,153.83 per week, except for the two weeks he received $769.24 and $961.55. He argues, however, that Boston Harley did not pay him on a \"salary basis,\" because it reduced his pay for these two pay periods. The regulations state that \"[a]n employee will be considered to be paid on a `salary basis' . . . if the employee regularly receives each pay period on a weekly, or less frequent[,] basis, a predetermined amount constituting all or part of the employee's compensation, which amount is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed.\" <i>Id.</i> § 541.602(a). Subject to certain exceptions, \"an exempt employee must receive the full salary for any week in which the employee performs <span class=\"star-pagination\">*684</span> any work without regard to the number of days or hours worked.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court, mistakenly stating that Cash began work on Thursday, August 26, 2004 (instead of April 26, 2004), concluded that these two pay periods accurately reflected the 1.5 weeks Cash worked at this time.</p>\n<p>Regardless of this date error, Boston Harley prevails on this point. A regulation issued August 23, 2004, provides that an employer \"shall lose the exemption if the facts demonstrate that the employer did not intend to pay employees on a salary basis.\" <i>Id.</i> § 541.603(a). \"An <i>actual practice</i> of making improper deductions demonstrates\" this intent. <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). An actual practice of making improper deductions is evidenced by \"the number of improper deductions.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We conclude that two aberrant paychecks out of the approximately 50 that Cash received do not amount to an \"actual practice.\" <i>See </i><i>Kennedy v. Commonwealth Edison Co.,</i> 410 F.3d 365, 372 (7th Cir. 2005) (\"Identifying a few random, isolated, and negligible deductions is not enough to show an actual practice or policy of treating as hourly the theoretically salaried.\"). Indeed, even Cash stated that he was earning a \"salary\" of $1,153.85 per week.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we conclude that Boston Harley paid Cash on a \"salary basis.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(b) Primary duty related to management and includes exercise of discretion</h2>\n<p>The next questions are whether Cash's \"primary duty\" at Boston Harley (a) \"was the performance of office or non-manual work directly related to management or general business operations of [Boston Harley] or its customers,\" and (b) \"include[d] the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.\" 29 C.F.R. § 541.200.</p>\n<p>\"The term `primary duty' means the principal, main, major or most important duty that the employee performs.\" <i>Id.</i> § 541.700. \"Determination of an employee's primary duty must be based on all the facts in a particular case, with the major emphasis on the character of the employee's job as a whole.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>\"The phrase `directly related to the management or general business operations'\" in the exemption's second requirement \"refers to the type of work performed by the employee.\" <i>Id.</i> § 541.201(a). \"To meet this requirement, an employee must perform work directly related to assisting with the running or servicing of the business, as distinguished, for example, from working on a manufacturing production line or selling a product in a retail or service establishment.\" <i>Id.</i> \"Work directly related to management or general business operations includes work in functional areas such as finance, quality control, and personnel management.\" <i>Id.</i> § 541.201(b).</p>\n<p>In general, \"the exercise of discretion and independent judgment,\" i.e., the exemption's third requirement, \"involves the comparison and the evaluation of possible courses of conduct, and acting or making a decision after the various possibilities have been considered.\" <i>Id.</i> § 541.202(a). \"The term `matters of significance,'\" to which that discretion must apply, \"refers to the level of importance or consequence of the work performed.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Regulation 29 C.F.R. § 541.203 provides examples of employees who \"generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption.\" For instance, employees in the financial-services industry are generally exempt \"if their duties include work such as collecting and analyzing information regarding the customer's income, assets, investments or debts; determining <span class=\"star-pagination\">*685</span> which financial products best meet the customer's needs and financial circumstances; advising the customer regarding the advantages and disadvantages of different financial products; and marketing, servicing or promoting the employer's financial products.\" <i>Id.</i> § 541.203(b). On the other hand, a financial-services employee \"whose primary duty is selling financial products does not qualify for the administrative exemption.\" <i>Id.</i> \"Similarly, human-resources managers who formulate, interpret, or implement employment policies generally meet the duties requirements for the exemption, but personnel clerks who merely `screen' applicants to obtain data regarding their minimum qualifications generally do not meet the duties requirements.\" <i>Id.</i> § 541.203(e).</p>\n<p>The caselaw is consistent with these examples. In <i>John Alden</i> we affirmed a district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of a life-insurance company, concluding that the company's marketing representatives-who worked with outside agents to sell insurance policies to customers-fell under the administrative exemption. 126 F.3d at 3. The first (\"salary basis\") requirement was not at issue. The Court explained that the marketing representatives' duties met the second (\"management\") requirement because they were \"engaged in something more than routine selling efforts focused simply on particular sales transactions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 10 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Rather, their agent contacts [were] aimed at promoting (i.e., increasing, developing, facilitating, and/or maintaining) customer sales <i>generally.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). Their duties also met the third (\"discretion\") requirement: they had \"discretion in choosing which agents to contact on any given day, and concerning which products to discuss with each agent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 13. \"In addition, the marketing representatives rel[ied] on their own knowledge of an agent's business to help tailor proposals for the agent's end-customers.\" <i>Id.</i> \"[T]he content of a given conversation with an agent [was] dictated by the needs or customer base of that agent, or by the particular information sought by the marketing representative during that phone call.\" <i>Id.</i> at 14. The Court therefore concluded that the marketing representatives were \"not merely `skilled' workers who operate[d] within a strict set of rules,\" rather, they exercised significant discretion. <i>Id.</i> Consequently, the Court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the company. <i>Id.</i>; <i>cf. </i><i>Dalheim v. KDFW-TV,</i> 918 F.2d 1220, 1231 (5th Cir. 1990) (holding that television station producers' jobs did not fit into administrative exemption because they produced the station's news-department product and were not involved in the administrative operations).</p>\n<p>In the run-up to his employment, Cash provided Boston Harley with his conception of the job that he would assume as the \"New Purchases/Customer Relations Manager.\" He described these duties as including the following: (i) developing an \"overall Customer Service strategic plan\"; (ii) developing a \"clear business plan to support organizational changes\"; and (iii) taking \"appropriate action\" regarding delivery problems.</p>\n<p>On the job, he performed some, but not all, of the functions that his proposed job description anticipated. He worked with various Boston Harley departments to ensure that motorcycles were properly outfitted and delivered. If ordered parts were not installed on the motorcycles, Cash instructed the Service Manager concerning what needed to be done. He also was to stay in contact with the customers to make sure that they were happy with the service they were receiving. It is reasonable to infer that his performance of these duties <span class=\"star-pagination\">*686</span> was infused by his broader pre-job conception of his responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Cash's employment at Boston Harley meets the \"management\" and \"discretion\" requirements of the administrative exemption. First, like the marketing representatives in <i>John Alden,</i> Cash was \"engaged in something more than routine selling efforts focused simply on particular sales transactions.\" 126 F.3d at 10. Rather, he focused on improving customer service generally, by coordinating with various Boston Harley departments to ensure that customers were satisfied with their purchase and that they would provide Boston Harley with positive feedback reports. <i>Cf.</i> 29 C.F.R. § 541.203(b) (noting that a financial-services representative who \"determin[es] which financial products best meet the customer's needs and financial circumstances\" is generally exempt, whereas a financial-services representative who merely \"sell[s] financial products\" is not). Second, just as the marketing representatives in <i>John Alden</i> exercised significant discretion by, among other things, \"fashioning bid proposals that me[t] the needs of the agent's customers,\" 126 F.3d at 14, Cash exercised discretion in reacting to the unique needs of Boston Harley's customers. Thus, Cash was \"not merely [a] `skilled' worker[] who operate[d] within a strict set of rules.\" <i>Id.</i> Moreover, in return for performing his duties, he earned a $60,000 salary, which was greater or equal to that of all the other managers, except for Buchbaum. Cash's attendance at management meetings, albeit in a limited fashion, further supports his status as a manager. In sum, Cash did not simply produce a product; he exercised independent judgment as he engaged in the company's business operations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Cash meets each of administrative-exemption requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act; Boston Harley therefore is not liable to pay him overtime wages.</p>\n<p>2. Massachusetts Minimum Fair Wages Act</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts statute governing overtime pay mirrors the Fair Labor Standards Act. It states, in relevant part, that \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this section, no employer in the commonwealth shall employ any of his employees in an occupation . . . for a work week longer than forty hours, unless such employee receives compensation for his employment . . . in excess of forty hours at a rate not less than one and one half times the regular rate at which he is employed.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151, § 1A. The statute also provides for an exception where an employee is employed \"as a bona fide executive, or administrative or professional person . . . earning more than eighty dollars per week.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1A(3).</p>\n<p>The \"basic overtime provision of the Massachusetts statute is essentially identical to the [Fair Labor Standards Act].\" <i>Valerio v. Putnam Assocs. Inc.,</i> 173 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir.1999); <i>accord </i><i>McLaughlin v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 224 F.R.D. 295, 296 (D.Mass.2004) (referring to the filing of both claims as \"[r]iding that same horse\"). The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts agrees with this view. <i>See </i><i>Swift v. AutoZone, Inc.,</i> 441 Mass. 443, 806 N.E.2d 95, 98 (2004) (\"[T]he overtime provisions under State law were intended to be `essentially identical' to Federal law. . . .\") (citing <i>Valerio,</i> 173 F.3d at 40); <i>see also </i><i>Goodrow v. Lane Bryant, Inc.,</i> 432 Mass. 165, 732 N.E.2d 289, 294 (2000) (stating that the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Massachusetts statute are \"nearly identical\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*687</span> The resolution of Cash's Fair Labor Standards Act claim determines his Massachusetts statutory claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.

The district court granted Boston Harley's motion for summary judgment, concluding that Cash was an exempt \"administrative\" employee within the meaning of these Acts. <i>Cash v. Cycle Craft Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2310655\"><a href=\"/opinion/2310655/cash-v-cycle-craft-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span> (D.Mass. 2007). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We review the facts in the light most favorable to Cash, the nonmoving party below.</p>\n<p>In fall 2003, Cash was shopping at the Boston Harley motorcycle store and met the General Manager, Ron Buchbaum. This encounter, along with another in January 2004, led to discussions of Cash potentially working at Boston Harley. Buchbaum wanted Cash to create a new customer-service position. Cash drafted a job description for the position and Buchbaum suggested some changes, which Cash adopted. The job description titled the position \"New Purchase/Customer Relations Manager\" and identified the following responsibilities:</p>\n<blockquote>The ability to develop and implement a[n] overall Customer Service strategic plan that will allow [Boston Harley] to reach its current and long-term customer satisfaction goals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The ability to develop a clear business plan to support organizational changes, where needed, that provide efficiency and improve customer service delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>To ensure service goals and expectations of customers are met with optimum quality and satisfaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Identify and expeditiously resolve delivery problems. Develop and implement appropriate action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Liason between National representatives, the Dealership and the customer, resolving issues to assure complete and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*682</span> on-time shipment of bike and accessories delivery.</blockquote>\n<p>The job description also stated the position's qualifications, including a \"[m]inimum of five years experience\" in both \"Customer Service Management\" and \"as a Supervisor.\" Buchbaum offered Cash the position, which provided a $60,000 annual salary, along with health insurance and vacation after one year.</p>\n<p>Cash accepted the offer and started working at Boston Harley on April 26, 2004. His duties included working with various Boston Harley departments to make sure that they outfitted and delivered each motorcycle according to the particular purchase order. If ordered parts were not installed, he was to contact the service manager, Michael Sienkiewicz, and tell him what needed to be done. Once problems were resolved, Cash was to tell the finance department that the motorcycle was ready. That department would then set up a time with the customer for delivery or pickup. Cash then tracked the purchased motorcycles; it was his job to stay in touch with the customers and make sure that they were satisfied so that they would provide positive customer-feedback reports.</p>\n<p>As Cash's job worked out, he did not coordinate motorcycle ordering, delivery, or part installation. Nor did he supervise or manage any employees. However, he attended management meetings, except when Buchbaum instructed him not to. At these meetings, Cash reported the status of previously ordered motorcycles and their scheduled time for pickup or delivery. Often, after Cash provided these reports, Buchbaum told him to leave the meeting.</p>\n<p>Cash earned $1,153.85 per week (the prorated amount for his $60,000 salary) during his employment. He received this same salary each week regardless of hours worked, except for two pay periods: (1) the pay period ending August 28, 2004, when he was paid $769.24; and (2) the next pay period, ending September 4, 2004, when he was paid $961.55. Cash states that \"he was never paid for hours he worked over 40 hours [per week], yet he was routinely required to work overtime as part of his job, as is reflected in his payroll records.\"</p>\n<p>On April 8, 2005, almost one year after he started working at Boston Harley, Cash experienced an emotional problem at work. Boston Harley terminated his employment that day.</p>\n<p>On November 4, 2005, Cash brought suit in district court, alleging the statutory violations mentioned above. On April 6, 2007, the district court granted Boston Harley's motion for summary judgment. Cash appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p>We review de novo a district court's entry of summary judgment. <i>Dávila v. Corporación De P.R. Para La Difusión Pública,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202880\"><a href=\"/opinion/202880/davila-v-corporacion-de-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.2007). Like the district court, we take the facts of record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant (here, Cash) and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor. <i>Id.</i> Summary judgment is appropriate only when the record \"show[s] that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p>B. Cash's Claims</p>\n<p>1. Fair Labor Standards Act</p>\n<p>The Fair Labor Standards Act establishes the general rule that employers must compensate each employee at \"a rate not less than one and one-half times the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*683</span> regular rate\" for all overtime hours that an employee works. 29 U.S.C. § 207(a)(1). The Act defines overtime as employment in excess of 40 hours in a single workweek. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The Act exempts from this general rule certain so-called \"white-collar\" employees, i.e., \"any employee employed in a bona fide executive, <i>administrative,</i> or professional capacity. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> § 213(a)(1) (emphasis added). Boston Harley contends that Cash was such a \"white-collar\" employee because he served in an \"administrative\" capacity.</p>\n<p>An employer defending a suit under the Act bears the burden of establishing that a particular employee's job falls within such an exemption. <i>Reich v. John Alden Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197565\"><a href=\"/opinion/197565/reich-v-john-alden/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1997). Additionally, \"the remedial nature of the statute requires that [its] exemptions be `narrowly construed against the employers seeking to assert them'\" and \"`limited to those establishments plainly and unmistakably within [the exemptions'] terms and spirit.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105994\"><a href=\"/opinion/105994/arnold-v-ben-kanowsky-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span>, 392, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105994\"><a href=\"/opinion/105994/arnold-v-ben-kanowsky-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span> (1960)).</p>\n<p>The Secretary of Labor has issued regulations that articulate some specific parameters of the exemption. <i>John Alden,</i> 126 F.3d at 7; <i>see</i> 29 C.F.R. § 541.200 (2004). Although the regulations merely state the Secretary's official position on how the statutes should be interpreted, a court must give them \"controlling weight unless [the court finds them] to be arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to the statute.\" <i>John Alden,</i> 126 F.3d at 8 (citing <i>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 843-44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2778</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1984)).</p>\n<p>According to the regulations, to establish that Cash was an \"employee in a bona fide administrative capacity,\" Boston Harley must show that he was an employee</p>\n<blockquote>(1) [c]ompensated on a <i>salary or fee basis</i> at a rate of not less than $455 per week . . ., exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) [w]hose primary duty is the performance of office or non-manual work <i>directly related to the management or general business operations</i> of the employer or the employer's customers; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) [w]hose primary duty includes the <i>exercise of discretion and independent judgment</i> with respect to matters of significance.</blockquote>\n<p>29 C.F.R. § 541.200 (emphasis added).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(a) Salary</h2>\n<p>Cash meets the $455-per-week compensation threshold in the regulation: he received $1,153.83 per week, except for the two weeks he received $769.24 and $961.55. He argues, however, that Boston Harley did not pay him on a \"salary basis,\" because it reduced his pay for these two pay periods. The regulations state that \"[a]n employee will be considered to be paid on a `salary basis' . . . if the employee regularly receives each pay period on a weekly, or less frequent[,] basis, a predetermined amount constituting all or part of the employee's compensation, which amount is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed.\" <i>Id.</i> § 541.602(a). Subject to certain exceptions, \"an exempt employee must receive the full salary for any week in which the employee performs <span class=\"star-pagination\">*684</span> any work without regard to the number of days or hours worked.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court, mistakenly stating that Cash began work on Thursday, August 26, 2004 (instead of April 26, 2004), concluded that these two pay periods accurately reflected the 1.5 weeks Cash worked at this time.</p>\n<p>Regardless of this date error, Boston Harley prevails on this point. A regulation issued August 23, 2004, provides that an employer \"shall lose the exemption if the facts demonstrate that the employer did not intend to pay employees on a salary basis.\" <i>Id.</i> § 541.603(a). \"An <i>actual practice</i> of making improper deductions demonstrates\" this intent. <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). An actual practice of making improper deductions is evidenced by \"the number of improper deductions.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We conclude that two aberrant paychecks out of the approximately 50 that Cash received do not amount to an \"actual practice.\" <i>See </i><i>Kennedy v. Commonwealth Edison Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790495\"><a href=\"/opinion/790495/terry-j-kennedy-v-commonwealth-edison-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span>, 372 (7th Cir. 2005) (\"Identifying a few random, isolated, and negligible deductions is not enough to show an actual practice or policy of treating as hourly the theoretically salaried.\"). Indeed, even Cash stated that he was earning a \"salary\" of $1,153.85 per week.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we conclude that Boston Harley paid Cash on a \"salary basis.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(b) Primary duty related to management and includes exercise of discretion</h2>\n<p>The next questions are whether Cash's \"primary duty\" at Boston Harley (a) \"was the performance of office or non-manual work directly related to management or general business operations of [Boston Harley] or its customers,\" and (b) \"include[d] the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.\" 29 C.F.R. § 541.200.</p>\n<p>\"The term `primary duty' means the principal, main, major or most important duty that the employee performs.\" <i>Id.</i> § 541.700. \"Determination of an employee's primary duty must be based on all the facts in a particular case, with the major emphasis on the character of the employee's job as a whole.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>\"The phrase `directly related to the management or general business operations'\" in the exemption's second requirement \"refers to the type of work performed by the employee.\" <i>Id.</i> § 541.201(a). \"To meet this requirement, an employee must perform work directly related to assisting with the running or servicing of the business, as distinguished, for example, from working on a manufacturing production line or selling a product in a retail or service establishment.\" <i>Id.</i> \"Work directly related to management or general business operations includes work in functional areas such as finance, quality control, and personnel management.\" <i>Id.</i> § 541.201(b).</p>\n<p>In general, \"the exercise of discretion and independent judgment,\" i.e., the exemption's third requirement, \"involves the comparison and the evaluation of possible courses of conduct, and acting or making a decision after the various possibilities have been considered.\" <i>Id.</i> § 541.202(a). \"The term `matters of significance,'\" to which that discretion must apply, \"refers to the level of importance or consequence of the work performed.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Regulation 29 C.F.R. § 541.203 provides examples of employees who \"generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption.\" For instance, employees in the financial-services industry are generally exempt \"if their duties include work such as collecting and analyzing information regarding the customer's income, assets, investments or debts; determining <span class=\"star-pagination\">*685</span> which financial products best meet the customer's needs and financial circumstances; advising the customer regarding the advantages and disadvantages of different financial products; and marketing, servicing or promoting the employer's financial products.\" <i>Id.</i> § 541.203(b). On the other hand, a financial-services employee \"whose primary duty is selling financial products does not qualify for the administrative exemption.\" <i>Id.</i> \"Similarly, human-resources managers who formulate, interpret, or implement employment policies generally meet the duties requirements for the exemption, but personnel clerks who merely `screen' applicants to obtain data regarding their minimum qualifications generally do not meet the duties requirements.\" <i>Id.</i> § 541.203(e).</p>\n<p>The caselaw is consistent with these examples. In <i>John Alden</i> we affirmed a district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of a life-insurance company, concluding that the company's marketing representatives-who worked with outside agents to sell insurance policies to customers-fell under the administrative exemption. 126 F.3d at 3. The first (\"salary basis\") requirement was not at issue. The Court explained that the marketing representatives' duties met the second (\"management\") requirement because they were \"engaged in something more than routine selling efforts focused simply on particular sales transactions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 10 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Rather, their agent contacts [were] aimed at promoting (i.e., increasing, developing, facilitating, and/or maintaining) customer sales <i>generally.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). Their duties also met the third (\"discretion\") requirement: they had \"discretion in choosing which agents to contact on any given day, and concerning which products to discuss with each agent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 13. \"In addition, the marketing representatives rel[ied] on their own knowledge of an agent's business to help tailor proposals for the agent's end-customers.\" <i>Id.</i> \"[T]he content of a given conversation with an agent [was] dictated by the needs or customer base of that agent, or by the particular information sought by the marketing representative during that phone call.\" <i>Id.</i> at 14. The Court therefore concluded that the marketing representatives were \"not merely `skilled' workers who operate[d] within a strict set of rules,\" rather, they exercised significant discretion. <i>Id.</i> Consequently, the Court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the company. <i>Id.</i>; <i>cf. </i><i>Dalheim v. KDFW-TV,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551500\"><a href=\"/opinion/551500/edward-w-dalheim-v-kdfw-tv/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1220</span></a></span>, 1231 (5th Cir. 1990) (holding that television station producers' jobs did not fit into administrative exemption because they produced the station's news-department product and were not involved in the administrative operations).</p>\n<p>In the run-up to his employment, Cash provided Boston Harley with his conception of the job that he would assume as the \"New Purchases/Customer Relations Manager.\" He described these duties as including the following: (i) developing an \"overall Customer Service strategic plan\"; (ii) developing a \"clear business plan to support organizational changes\"; and (iii) taking \"appropriate action\" regarding delivery problems.</p>\n<p>On the job, he performed some, but not all, of the functions that his proposed job description anticipated. He worked with various Boston Harley departments to ensure that motorcycles were properly outfitted and delivered. If ordered parts were not installed on the motorcycles, Cash instructed the Service Manager concerning what needed to be done. He also was to stay in contact with the customers to make sure that they were happy with the service they were receiving. It is reasonable to infer that his performance of these duties <span class=\"star-pagination\">*686</span> was infused by his broader pre-job conception of his responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Cash's employment at Boston Harley meets the \"management\" and \"discretion\" requirements of the administrative exemption. First, like the marketing representatives in <i>John Alden,</i> Cash was \"engaged in something more than routine selling efforts focused simply on particular sales transactions.\" 126 F.3d at 10. Rather, he focused on improving customer service generally, by coordinating with various Boston Harley departments to ensure that customers were satisfied with their purchase and that they would provide Boston Harley with positive feedback reports. <i>Cf.</i> 29 C.F.R. § 541.203(b) (noting that a financial-services representative who \"determin[es] which financial products best meet the customer's needs and financial circumstances\" is generally exempt, whereas a financial-services representative who merely \"sell[s] financial products\" is not). Second, just as the marketing representatives in <i>John Alden</i> exercised significant discretion by, among other things, \"fashioning bid proposals that me[t] the needs of the agent's customers,\" 126 F.3d at 14, Cash exercised discretion in reacting to the unique needs of Boston Harley's customers. Thus, Cash was \"not merely [a] `skilled' worker[] who operate[d] within a strict set of rules.\" <i>Id.</i> Moreover, in return for performing his duties, he earned a $60,000 salary, which was greater or equal to that of all the other managers, except for Buchbaum. Cash's attendance at management meetings, albeit in a limited fashion, further supports his status as a manager. In sum, Cash did not simply produce a product; he exercised independent judgment as he engaged in the company's business operations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Cash meets each of administrative-exemption requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act; Boston Harley therefore is not liable to pay him overtime wages.</p>\n<p>2. Massachusetts Minimum Fair Wages Act</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts statute governing overtime pay mirrors the Fair Labor Standards Act. It states, in relevant part, that \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this section, no employer in the commonwealth shall employ any of his employees in an occupation . . . for a work week longer than forty hours, unless such employee receives compensation for his employment . . . in excess of forty hours at a rate not less than one and one half times the regular rate at which he is employed.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151, § 1A. The statute also provides for an exception where an employee is employed \"as a bona fide executive, or administrative or professional person . . . earning more than eighty dollars per week.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1A(3).</p>\n<p>The \"basic overtime provision of the Massachusetts statute is essentially identical to the [Fair Labor Standards Act].\" <i>Valerio v.
