She then argues the\n\ndistrict court erred in dismissing her claims under Puerto\n\nRico law.     We address each argument in turn.\n\n     The     parties    are    familiar      with      the    facts,        and     we\n\ntherefore repeat them here only briefly.                 Plaintiff was born\n\non January 17, 1966.           Defendant hired Plaintiff to be a\n\npharmaceutical         sales   specialist         on    August         8,     2005.\n\nSupervisor Vanessa Gonzales (born August 15, 1970) and her\n\nsupervisor,     Elsa    Saavedra    (born     November       3,   1957),          both\n\nparticipated     in     the    hiring   process.             Plaintiff’s           job\n\ninvolved     visiting     physicians        and    obtaining      orders           for\n\nDefendant’s       products.             After          observing            several\n\ninconsistencies         and     possible          misrepresentations                in\n\n\n                                    - 2 -\n\fPlaintiff’s work and reports, Gonzales sought counsel from\n\nJohn    Kriegsmann          (born        September             27,     1943)     in      human\n\nresources.            He     recommended            that        Gonzales        conduct        a\n\nperformance         review        of    Plaintiff.              Gonzales         discovered\n\nseveral      problems       that       caused      her    to    question       Plaintiff’s\n\nhonesty.      Saavedra likewise reviewed Plaintiff’s performance\n\nand had similar concerns.                  On Kriegsmann’s recommendation,\n\nGonzales and Saavedra met with Plaintiff to discuss these\n\nproblems.           After        determining          that       her     responses          were\n\nunsatisfactory, they decided to terminate her on March 17,\n\n2006.        On   that     date,       Plaintiff         was    forty     years       and    two\n\nmonths old; Gonzales was thirty five years, seven months,\n\nand    two    days    old;       Saavedra       was      forty       eight     years,       four\n\nmonths, and fourteen days old; and Kriegsmann was sixty two\n\nyears, five months, and twenty one days old.\n\n       Plaintiffs making a case under the ADEA with indirect\n\nevidence may use the burden shifting analysis outlined in\n\nMcDonnell         Douglas    Corp.       v.     Green,         411   U.S.      792,    802–05\n\n(1973).      Torrech-Hernández v. General Electric Co., 519 F.3d\n\n41,    48    (1st    Cir.    2008).           In   analyzing           cases    under       this\n\nframework, we may put aside the question whether a plaintiff\n\nestablished a prima facie case of age discrimination under\n\nthe ADEA and consider first whether “there is evidence that,\n\nnotwithstanding            the     employer’s            stated        reasons     for       the\n\n\n\n                                          - 3 -\n\ftermination,       the       real    reason,        at     least     in    part,     was\n\nage . . . discrimination.”                  Hillstrom v. Best Western TLC\n\nHotel, 354 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 2003); see also Rivera-\n\nAponte v. Restaurant Metropol #3, Inc., 338 F.3d 9, 11 (1st\n\nCir.    2003)     (assuming         arguendo      that        the   plaintiff      could\n\nestablish    a    prima      facie    case     and       considering       whether    he\n\ncould prove his employer had a discriminatory motive for\n\ndischarging him).\n\n       Defendant    presented         evidence       of       several     grounds    for\n\nterminating       Plaintiff.          First,      Plaintiff         received     a   law\n\ndegree    but     did    not       include     it    on       her   resume      or   job\n\napplication, even though she included a master’s degree in\n\nEnglish linguistics.           Second, she misrepresented information\n\non expense reports and failed to follow protocol when she\n\nclaimed    expenses          for    ten    people        at    “lunch     and    learn”\n\nmeetings though fewer than ten attended.                        Third, Plaintiff’s\n\nsix-month performance review revealed multiple occasions on\n\nwhich she had reported several visits to doctors in a five\n\nto seven minute period, and her supervisors considered this\n\nto be insufficient time to make a proper call.                            Fourth, the\n\nreview showed Plaintiff often failed to work the required\n\nseven and a half hours each day.                    Fifth, Plaintiff violated\n\ncompany    policy       by   using     “mass      assignments”          (cutting     and\n\npasting     one     report          into     others        instead        of    writing\n\n\n\n                                          - 4 -\n\findividualized reports for each call).               Defendant argues any\n\none of these instances is grounds for termination, and all\n\nof   them   raised   serious   doubts      about    Plaintiff’s    honesty.\n\nDefendant     thus     satisfied    its    burden     of    production     by\n\narticulating “‘a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for its\n\nadverse employment action.’” Torrech-Hernández, 519 F.3d at\n\n48 (quoting Hoffman v. Applicators Sales & Serv., Inc., 439\n\nF.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir. 2006)).\n\n      To    demonstrate    pretext,       Plaintiff       relies   on    four\n\nallegedly     ageist    remarks.     First,        when   she   traveled   to\n\nsupervisor Vanessa Gonzales’s house to pick up materials for\n\nwork, she informed Gonzales that she was suffering from a\n\nmedical condition.        Gonzales told her to visit a doctor and\n\nsaid “those things come with age.”             Second, during a break\n\nat a work meeting, a coworker was selling bikinis.                       When\n\nPlaintiff asked whether there was one for her, Gonzales said\n\nshe was “too old for one.”           Third, when Gonzales met with\n\nPlaintiff to discuss the improper expense reports, she told\n\nPlaintiff “you are too old, Doris.                  You are too old for\n\nthis.      You are too old to be making these mistakes.                  This\n\nis unacceptable.”       Fourth, when Gonzales and her supervisor,\n\nElsa Saavedra, met with Plaintiff to discuss concerns about\n\nher performance and dishonesty, they told her she “was old\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 5 -\n\fenough     to    know     what        it    means     to     lie       and    to    omit”\n\ninformation.\n\n       As the district court noted in its thorough and well-\n\nreasoned order, “‘stray workplace remarks’ . . . normally\n\nare    insufficient,       standing           alone,        to    establish        either\n\npretext or the requisite discriminatory animus.”                               Gonzalez\n\nv. El Dia, Inc., 304 F.3d 63, 69 (1st Cir. 2002).                             The first\n\ntwo remarks, concerning a medical problem and bikinis, were\n\nrude     but     not    related        to     the     decision          to    terminate\n\nPlaintiff’s employment.                In Straughn v. Delta Air Lines,\n\nInc., 250 F.3d 23, 36 (1st Cir. 2001), we said:                               “[T]hough\n\nsuch ‘stray remarks’ may be material to the pretext inquiry,\n\n‘their    probativeness          is    circumscribed             if    they   were    not\n\nrelated to the employment decision in question . . . .’”\n\n(quoting       McMillan    v.    Massachussetts              Soc’y      for   Prev.    of\n\nCruelty to Animals, 140 F.3d 288, 301 (1st Cir. 1998)).                                On\n\nthe facts of this case, Gonzales’s stray remarks concerning\n\na     medical    problem        and        bikinis     are       not    significantly\n\nprobative of pretext.             Id.         “Although statements directly\n\nrelated to the challenged employment action may be highly\n\nprobative in the pretext inquiry, mere generalized ‘stray\n\nremarks,’       arguably   probative          of     bias    against      a   protected\n\nclass, normally are not probative of pretext absent some\n\ndiscernible evidentiary basis for assessing their temporal\n\n\n                                           - 6 -\n\fand contextual relevance.”                Id.   Taken in the light most\n\nfavorable to Plaintiff, the second two statements are, at\n\nbest, ambiguous.           Though made by supervisors close to the\n\ntime   of   Plaintiff’s         termination,    they     arguably       reflect   a\n\nbelief that positive attributes such as honesty and accuracy\n\ncome with age.       Both could be expressions of confusion about\n\nPlaintiff’s actions, admonishments to act responsibly, or\n\nremarks     indicating       animus.      Because    these   statements       are\n\nambiguous,        they    are    insufficient       to    prove     Defendant’s\n\ndiscriminatory intent.            See Lehman v. Prudential Ins. Co. of\n\nAm., 74 F.3d 323, 329 (1st Cir. 1996) (“Isolated, ambiguous\n\nremarks      are     insufficient,         by   themselves,          to     prove\n\ndiscriminatory           intent.”).         Additionally,         the     context\n\nprovides no additional evidence of discriminatory intent:\n\nTwo    of   the    same    supervisors      participated      in    hiring    and\n\nfiring Plaintiff; those supervisors provided several valid\n\nconcerns about Plaintiff’s honesty; and two of the three\n\npeople who participated in the decision to fire Plaintiff\n\nare more than five years her senior.                     Therefore, we agree\n\nwith the district court that Plaintiff failed to provide\n\nsufficient        evidence      that   Defendant’s       stated    reasons    for\n\nterminating her were pretextual.\n\n       Plaintiff also argues the district court should not have\n\ndismissed     her    claims       under   Puerto    Rico     law.        While    a\n\n\n\n                                       - 7 -\n\fdistrict court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over\n\nnonfederal   law    claims,     the     court      may    also   “decline   to\n\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim . . . if the\n\ndistrict court has dismissed all claims over which it has\n\noriginal jurisdiction.”          28 U.S.C. § 1367.               See Marrero-\n\nGutierrez v. Molina, 491 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2007).                    Because\n\nthe   district    court   properly      dismissed        Plaintiff’s    claims\n\nunder   federal    law,   it   did    not    err   in    dismissing    without\n\nprejudice her claims under Puerto Rico law as well.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 8 -\n\f",

He     recommended            that        Gonzales        conduct        a\n\nperformance         review        of    Plaintiff.              Gonzales         discovered\n\nseveral      problems       that       caused      her    to    question       Plaintiff’s\n\nhonesty.      Saavedra likewise reviewed Plaintiff’s performance\n\nand had similar concerns.                  On Kriegsmann’s recommendation,\n\nGonzales and Saavedra met with Plaintiff to discuss these\n\nproblems.           After        determining          that       her     responses          were\n\nunsatisfactory, they decided to terminate her on March 17,\n\n2006.        On   that     date,       Plaintiff         was    forty     years       and    two\n\nmonths old; Gonzales was thirty five years, seven months,\n\nand    two    days    old;       Saavedra       was      forty       eight     years,       four\n\nmonths, and fourteen days old; and Kriegsmann was sixty two\n\nyears, five months, and twenty one days old.\n\n       Plaintiffs making a case under the ADEA with indirect\n\nevidence may use the burden shifting analysis outlined in\n\nMcDonnell         Douglas    Corp.       v.

First,      Plaintiff         received     a   law\n\ndegree    but     did    not       include     it    on       her   resume      or   job\n\napplication, even though she included a master’s degree in\n\nEnglish linguistics.           Second, she misrepresented information\n\non expense reports and failed to follow protocol when she\n\nclaimed    expenses          for    ten    people        at    “lunch     and    learn”\n\nmeetings though fewer than ten attended.                        Third, Plaintiff’s\n\nsix-month performance review revealed multiple occasions on\n\nwhich she had reported several visits to doctors in a five\n\nto seven minute period, and her supervisors considered this\n\nto be insufficient time to make a proper call.                            Fourth, the\n\nreview showed Plaintiff often failed to work the required\n\nseven and a half hours each day.                    Fifth, Plaintiff violated\n\ncompany    policy       by   using     “mass      assignments”          (cutting     and\n\npasting     one     report          into     others        instead        of    writing\n\n\n\n                                          - 4 -\n\findividualized reports for each call).               Defendant argues any\n\none of these instances is grounds for termination, and all\n\nof   them   raised   serious   doubts      about    Plaintiff’s    honesty.\n\nDefendant     thus     satisfied    its    burden     of    production     by\n\narticulating “‘a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for its\n\nadverse employment action.’” Torrech-Hernández, 519 F.3d at\n\n48 (quoting Hoffman v.

First,        when   she   traveled   to\n\nsupervisor Vanessa Gonzales’s house to pick up materials for\n\nwork, she informed Gonzales that she was suffering from a\n\nmedical condition.        Gonzales told her to visit a doctor and\n\nsaid “those things come with age.”             Second, during a break\n\nat a work meeting, a coworker was selling bikinis.                       When\n\nPlaintiff asked whether there was one for her, Gonzales said\n\nshe was “too old for one.”           Third, when Gonzales met with\n\nPlaintiff to discuss the improper expense reports, she told\n\nPlaintiff “you are too old, Doris.                  You are too old for\n\nthis.      You are too old to be making these mistakes.                  This\n\nis unacceptable.”       Fourth, when Gonzales and her supervisor,\n\nElsa Saavedra, met with Plaintiff to discuss concerns about\n\nher performance and dishonesty, they told her she “was old\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 5 -\n\fenough     to    know     what        it    means     to     lie       and    to    omit”\n\ninformation.\n\n       As the district court noted in its thorough and well-\n\nreasoned order, “‘stray workplace remarks’ . . . normally\n\nare    insufficient,       standing           alone,        to    establish        either\n\npretext or the requisite discriminatory animus.”                               Gonzalez\n\nv.

The first\n\ntwo remarks, concerning a medical problem and bikinis, were\n\nrude     but     not    related        to     the     decision          to    terminate\n\nPlaintiff’s employment.

On\n\nthe facts of this case, Gonzales’s stray remarks concerning\n\na     medical    problem        and        bikinis     are       not    significantly\n\nprobative of pretext.             Id.         “Although statements directly\n\nrelated to the challenged employment action may be highly\n\nprobative in the pretext inquiry, mere generalized ‘stray\n\nremarks,’       arguably   probative          of     bias    against      a   protected\n\nclass, normally are not probative of pretext absent some\n\ndiscernible evidentiary basis for assessing their temporal\n\n\n                                           - 6 -\n\fand contextual relevance.”                Id.   Taken in the light most\n\nfavorable to Plaintiff, the second two statements are, at\n\nbest, ambiguous.           Though made by supervisors close to the\n\ntime   of   Plaintiff’s         termination,    they     arguably       reflect   a\n\nbelief that positive attributes such as honesty and accuracy\n\ncome with age.       Both could be expressions of confusion about\n\nPlaintiff’s actions, admonishments to act responsibly, or\n\nremarks     indicating       animus.      Because    these   statements       are\n\nambiguous,        they    are    insufficient       to    prove     Defendant’s\n\ndiscriminatory intent.            See Lehman v. Prudential Ins.

Additionally,         the     context\n\nprovides no additional evidence of discriminatory intent:\n\nTwo    of   the    same    supervisors      participated      in    hiring    and\n\nfiring Plaintiff; those supervisors provided several valid\n\nconcerns about Plaintiff’s honesty; and two of the three\n\npeople who participated in the decision to fire Plaintiff\n\nare more than five years her senior.                     Therefore, we agree\n\nwith the district court that Plaintiff failed to provide\n\nsufficient        evidence      that   Defendant’s       stated    reasons    for\n\nterminating her were pretextual.\n\n       Plaintiff also argues the district court should not have\n\ndismissed     her    claims       under   Puerto    Rico     law.
