Drew for petitioner.\n     Kohsei Ugumori, Trial Attorney, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, Peter Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, and Michelle\nGorden Latour, Assistant Director, for respondent.\n\n\n\n                        September 27, 2007\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge. Petitioners Sherly Ferdinandus and\n\nBerty Lumentut, both natives and citizens of Indonesia, seek review\n\nof   the   denial   of    Ferdinandus's    application    for   asylum     and\n\nwithholding of removal.       We deny the petition for review.\n\n            Ferdinandus     and   Lumentut,   who   married   and   had   four\n\nchildren in Indonesia, entered the United States on Indonesian\n\npassports on August 26, 2000.          Their visitor visas expired on\n\nFebruary 25, 2001.       Lumentut was served with a Notice to Appear in\n\nApril 2003; Ferdinandus received her Notice to Appear that August.\n\nBoth conceded all allegations against them, but Ferdinandus filed\n\nan application for asylum and withholding of removal, claiming\n\nreligious persecution, with her husband listed as a derivative\n\nbeneficiary.\n\n            Ferdinandus and Lumentut have been active Christians,\n\nboth in Indonesia and in the United States.            Ferdinandus claimed\n\npersecution based on her experience in the May 1998 Jakarta riots\n\nand the ongoing targeting of churches in Indonesia by Muslim\n\nextremists.    In her asylum application, Ferdinandus described how\n\nshe watched the riots unfold on television.          In her hearing before\n\nthe Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") on November 2, 2005, Ferdinandus\n\ntestified that when she ventured out of her house, rioters stopped\n\nher car and asked \"very rude and very angry\" questions.                    She\n\nbelieved she was stopped because a sticker on her car read, \"Jesus\n\nis the way of life.\"      She was allowed to leave, however, after one\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fof    her   sons   gave   the    men   money.   Additionally,   Ferdinandus\n\ntestified about witnessing looting, beatings, and the burning of\n\nbuildings.     She also testified, however, that while in Indonesia,\n\nshe had always been able to go to church to worship and that she\n\nhad been a leader of her church's women's group.              She testified\n\nthat she feared returning to Indonesia because extremists continue\n\nto burn churches, and she does not believe the government will\n\nprovide adequate protection against such attacks.\n\n             The IJ issued his decision the same day, ruling that\n\nFerdinandus's asylum application was time-barred and that she had\n\nnot presented changed or extraordinary circumstances excusing her\n\ndelay.      See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2).           He also determined that\n\nFerdinandus did not qualify for withholding of removal, finding\n\nthat she had demonstrated neither past incidents of persecution nor\n\na    likelihood    of   future   persecution.    He   did   grant   voluntary\n\ndeparture.\n\n             The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirmed the\n\nIJ's decision in a December 29, 2006, per curiam opinion.                  It\n\nagreed that Ferdinandus's asylum application was time-barred, that\n\nher experience during the Jakarta riots did not rise to the level\n\nof persecution, and that the fact that Ferdinandus's children still\n\nlived and worshiped safely in Indonesia indicated that Ferdinandus\n\nwould not suffer persecution upon her return.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f           In her petition for review before this court, Ferdinandus\n\nchallenges the timeliness finding and the finding that there is no\n\n\"pattern   or    practice    of   persecution\"      of   other    Christians    in\n\nIndonesia sufficient to establish a likelihood that Ferdinandus\n\nwill be persecuted.        See 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2).\n\n           As    a   preliminary    matter,    we   lack       jurisdiction   over\n\nFerdinandus's     asylum    application     because      the    BIA's   timeliness\n\ndetermination is not reviewable.            8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3); Awad v.\n\nGonzales, 463 F.3d 73, 76 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           As for the withholding of removal claim, we review the\n\nBIA's decision in addition to those portions of the IJ's decision\n\nto which the BIA deferred. Chahid Hayek v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 501,\n\n506 (1st Cir. 2006).        We accept the BIA's factual findings \"unless\n\nany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary.\"      8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).       To qualify for withholding\n\nof removal, Ferdinandus must establish either that she suffered\n\npast persecution on account of her religion1 or that it is more\n\nlikely than not that she will suffer such persecution upon her\n\nreturn to Indonesia.        8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b); Chahid Hayek, 445 F.3d\n\nat 507.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          Establishing past persecution does not by itself justify\nwithholding of removal, but creates a rebuttable presumption of\nfuture persecution, which is the required showing.       8 C.F.R.\n§ 208.16(1).\n\n                                      -4-\n\f              The     BIA         reasonably      concluded     that        Ferdinandus's\n\nexperience during the Jakarta riots did not constitute persecution.\n\nIt was an isolated incident without violence or detention.                              See,\n\ne.g.,    Awad,      463     F.3d    at    76    (persecution    is   more     than   \"mere\n\nharassment or annoyance\" (quoting Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d\n\n565, 570 (1st Cir. 1999)) (internal quotation mark omitted));\n\nSharari v. Gonzales, 407 F.3d 467, 474 (1st Cir. 2005).                         As the IJ\n\nnoted,    \"the      petitioner        ha[d]      never   been   arrested,      detained,\n\nthreatened, or put in harm's way by the Indonesian government or\n\nany of its agents on account of her religious beliefs.\"                                  See\n\nNikijuluw      v.     Gonzales,          427   F.3d    115,   121    (1st    Cir.    2005)\n\n(persecution must be the result of the government's actions or\n\ninactions); Pieterson v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 38, 45 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(petitioner         who     was    never       \"physically    harmed,       detained,    or\n\narrested\" failed to demonstrate persecution).                        The IJ also noted\n\nthat it was unclear whether Ferdinandus's car was stopped because\n\nof the sticker referring to Jesus or simply because the rioters\n\nwanted money.         See Toloza-Jimenez v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 155, 160\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (petitioner failed to establish past persecution\n\nwhen    she   did     not    show     that      her   mistreatment    was     politically\n\nmotivated); Pieterson, 364 F.3d at 44 (\"[T]here was no proven nexus\n\nbetween the violence in Sierra Leone and Pieterson's ethnicity and\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fpolitical beliefs.\").   Ferdinandus herself described the Jakarta\n\nriots as primarily targeting ethnic Chinese.2\n\n          The BIA also reasonably concluded that it was not \"more\n\nlikely than not\" that Ferdinandus would be persecuted upon her\n\nreturn to Indonesia.    8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2).      It permissibly\n\nreasoned that the safety of Ferdinandus's children, who still live\n\nand attend church in Indonesia, undercuts Ferdinandus's argument\n\nthat she will suffer persecution.     See, e.g., Melhem v. Gonzales,\n\n___ F.3d ___, 2007 WL 2404479, at *3 (1st Cir. Aug. 24, 2007); Ouk\n\nv. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 108, 111 (1st Cir. 2006); Chahid Hayek, 445\n\nF.3d at 509.   Further, the IJ noted that the Indonesian government\n\nis working to diffuse religious tensions and that the targeting of\n\nchurches has been on the decline.     There was thus no indication of\n\na \"pattern or practice of persecution\" sufficient to establish any\n\nlikelihood that Ferdinandus will be targeted upon her return.\n\n          The petition is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          Ferdinandus claimed in her original application and\naffidavit that her daughter was raped and that the rape was also an\nincident of past persecution. This argument was not made before\nthe IJ or BIA, but it would have failed for the same reasons: the\nalleged rape was private conduct not clearly connected to the\nfamily's religion.\n\n                                -6-\n\f",

Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201886\"><a href=\"/opinion/201886/nikijuluw-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 121 (1st Cir.2005) (persecution must be the result of the government's actions or inactions); <i>Pieterson v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200965\"><a href=\"/opinion/200965/pieterson-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2004) (petitioner who was never \"physically harmed, detained, or arrested\" failed to demonstrate persecution). The IJ also noted that it was unclear whether Ferdinandus's car was stopped because of the sticker referring to Jesus or simply because the rioters wanted money. <i>See </i><i>Toloza-Jimenez v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></span>, 160 (1st Cir.2006) (petitioner failed to establish past persecution when she did not show that her mistreatment was politically motivated); <i>Pieterson,</i> 364 F.3d at 44 (\"[T]here was no proven nexus between the violence in Sierra Leone and Pieterson's ethnicity and political beliefs.\"). Ferdinandus herself described the Jakarta riots as primarily targeting ethnic Chinese.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The BIA also reasonably concluded that it was not \"more likely than not\" that Ferdinandus would be persecuted upon her return to Indonesia. 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2). It permissibly reasoned that the safety of Ferdinandus's children, who still live and attend church in Indonesia, undercuts Ferdinandus's argument that she will suffer persecution. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Melhem v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202909\"><a href=\"/opinion/202909/melhem-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 80 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Ouk v.

Further, the IJ noted that the Indonesian government is working to diffuse religious tensions and that the targeting of churches has been on the decline. There was thus no indication of a \"pattern or practice of persecution\" sufficient to establish any likelihood that Ferdinandus will be targeted upon her return.</p>\n<p>The petition is denied.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Establishing past persecution does not by itself justify withholding of removal, but creates a rebuttable presumption of future persecution, which is the required showing. 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(1).</p>\n<p>[2]  Ferdinandus claimed in her original application and affidavit that her daughter was raped and that the rape was also an incident of past persecution. This argument was not made before the IJ or BIA, but it would have failed for the same reasons: the alleged rape was private conduct not clearly connected to the family's religion.</p>\n\n</div>",
