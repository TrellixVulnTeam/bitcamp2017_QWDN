Marrero, with whom Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal\nPublic Defender, and Victor J. Gonzalez-Bothwell, Assistant Federal\nPublic Defender, were on brief for appellant.\n     Germán A. Rieckehoff, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Rosa E. Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and Nelson\nPérez Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                           November 24, 2008\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f             DICLERICO, District Judge.             Victor Acosta-Roman pled\n\nguilty, pursuant to a written plea agreement, to three money\n\nlaundering counts and received three concurrent fifty-seven month\n\nsentences.      On appeal, he contends that the district court erred\n\nin adding a six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b)(1) and\n\nthat the waiver provision in his plea agreement does not bar his\n\nappeal.      The   government     contends     that    the     appeal      should    be\n\ndismissed because Acosta waived his right to appeal.\n\n                                I.    Background\n\n             In April of 2005, indictments were returned in two cases\n\ncharging Acosta, his wife, and others with conspiracy to commit\n\nmoney laundering in violation of          18 U.S.C. § 1956(h), substantive\n\nmoney     laundering   in     violation   of   18     U.S.C.       §    1956(a),     and\n\nconspiracy to import narcotics in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 952 and\n\n§ 963.     After the cases were consolidated, Acosta pled guilty to\n\ntwo counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count\n\nof money laundering. In pleading guilty, Acosta admitted that from\n\nAugust of 2002 through January of 2005, and from December of 2002\n\nto October of 2004, he conspired with others to conduct financial\n\ntransactions involving the proceeds of illegal drug dealings, that\n\nthe   transactions     were    designed   to   conceal       the       source   of   the\n\nproceeds, and that he knew the proceeds were from unlawful activity\n\nin violation of § 1956(h).1          He also admitted that on September 25,\n\n      1\n      Although Acosta pled guilty to laundering the proceeds of\nillegal drug dealings and admitted that he knew the funds were the\nproceeds of unlawful activity, he did not admit that he knew, at\n\n                                        -2-\n\f2003, he engaged in laundering $139,426.00 in violation of §\n\n1956(a)(1)(B)(I) and § 1956(a)(2).\n\n            Acosta’s plea agreement recited the maximum penalties\n\napplicable to those counts, warned that the court was not bound by\n\nthe plea agreement, and stated that the sentence would be left to\n\nthe court’s discretion.         Acosta and the government agreed to\n\nadvisory guideline sentencing calculations that provided a base\n\noffense level of eight, a twelve-level upward adjustment under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1)(G), a two-level increase because of the\n\nviolation of § 1956, and a three-level downward adjustment for\n\nacceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1.           They did not\n\nagree on an adjusted offense level, and the agreement stated that\n\nAcosta’s total offense level would be determined by the court at\n\nsentencing based upon the court’s rulings on “certain sentencing\n\nfactors.”\n\n            The plea agreement further provided that at sentencing\n\nthe government would argue in favor of a six-level enhancement\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b), while Acosta would argue against the\n\nenhancement.     The agreement included a provision titled “WAIVER OF\n\nAPPEAL,” which provided that “[t]he defendant hereby agrees that if\n\nthis Honorable Court accepts this agreement and sentences hi[m]\n\naccording   to   its   terms   and   conditions,   defendant    waives   and\n\n\n\n\nthe time, that illegal drug dealings were the source of the money\ninvolved in those transactions.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fsurrenders [his] right to appeal the conviction and sentence in\n\nthis case.”\n\n              The sentencing hearing took place over a period of four\n\ndays.    The court addressed the enhancement issue under U.S.S.G. §\n\n2S1.1(b), which provides for an increase of six levels if the\n\ndefendant knew or believed that any of the laundered funds were the\n\nproceeds of, among other things, an offense involving illegal\n\ndrugs.      The    government     presented     the    testimony        of    two    DEA\n\nundercover     agents,    Diaz    and   Rivera,     who     participated       in    the\n\ninvestigation that led to Acosta’s arrest.                  They testified about\n\nthe   money     laundering   operations       and     the    circumstances          that\n\nimplicated Acosta.         In particular, the agents testified about\n\nAcosta’s involvement, with his wife, in delivering large amounts of\n\ncash on three occasions.\n\n              Acosta also testified at the hearing.              He admitted that\n\nhe knew the money was obtained unlawfully, but he denied any\n\nknowledge     of   the   source   of    the   money.        He   also    denied     the\n\ncircumstances described by Agent Rivera, which suggested that he\n\nwould have knowledge that the money was drug proceeds.\n\n              Based on the evidence presented during the sentencing\n\nhearing, the court concluded that Acosta’s testimony, denying\n\nknowledge of the source of the money, was not credible.                      The court\n\ncredited Agent Rivera’s testimony and concluded, by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence, that Acosta knew the money he delivered for\n\nlaundering was illegal drug proceeds.               The court imposed a six-\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\flevel enhancement under § 2S1.1(b).        Acosta was sentenced to three\n\nfifty-seven month terms to be served concurrently.\n\n                             II.   Discussion\n\n             On appeal, Acosta contends that the district court erred\n\nin applying the six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b)\n\nbecause the evidence did not support a finding that he knew the\n\nmoney he delivered for laundering was illegal drug proceeds.         He\n\nargues that the waiver of appeal provision in his plea agreement\n\ndoes not bar his appeal because the waiver applies only to the\n\nterms and conditions of the agreement and not to the enhancement\n\nimposed at sentencing.        The government asserts that the waiver\n\napplies and that the appeal must be dismissed.\n\n             Before considering the merits of Acosta’s claim, we must\n\ndetermine whether the waiver of appeal provision is enforceable\n\nunder the circumstances of this case.         United States v. Miliano,\n\n480   F.3d    605,   607   (1st    Cir.   2007).    “‘[U]nder   ordinary\n\ncircumstances, a knowing, voluntary waiver of the right to appeal\n\nfrom a sentence, contained in a plea agreement, ought to be\n\nenforced.’”     United States v. Cardona-Diaz, 524 F.3d 20, 22 (1st\n\nCir. 2008) (quoting United States v. Teeter,        257 F.3d 14, 23 (1st\n\nCir. 2001)).     When its validity is challenged, a waiver is tested\n\nby considering whether the waiver statement and its scope are\n\nsufficiently clear, whether the district court questioned the\n\ndefendant as to his understanding of the waiver and informed him of\n\nits ramifications, and whether enforcing the waiver would cause a\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fmiscarriage of justice. United States v. Chandler, 534 F.3d 45, 49\n\n(1st Cir. 2008).\n\n          In this case, however, Acosta does not challenge the\n\nvalidity of his waiver or assert that its enforcement would work a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.2    Cf. United States v. Edelen, 539 F.3d 83,\n\n85 (1st Cir. 2008) (defendant argued waiver was involuntary and\n\nunknowing); Chandler, 534 F.3d at 49 (defendant argued district\n\ncourt’s description of waiver inadequate); Cardona-Diaz, 524 F.3d\n\nat 22-23 (defendant argued miscarriage of justice).             Instead,\n\nAcosta asserts that under its terms, the waiver does not apply to\n\nhis appeal of the U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b) enhancement issue.\n\n          “Even    a   knowing   and   voluntary   appeal   waiver   only\n\nprecludes appeals that fall within its scope.”        United States v.\n\nMcCoy, 508 F.3d 74, 77 (1st Cir. 2007).     “[T]he scope of the waiver\n\nis simply a matter of what the parties agreed to in the particular\n\ncase.”   Id.   Plea agreements are construed under basic contract\n\nprinciples.    United States v. Newbert, 504 F.3d 180, 185 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n          The waiver provision in Acosta’s plea agreement states\n\nthat he waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence “if\n\nthe Honorable Court accepts this agreement and sentences [Acosta]\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      At oral argument, counsel addressed the waiver under contract\nprinciples and explicitly declined to pursue any issue that the\nwaiver was invalid or that enforcement would constitute a\nmiscarriage of justice.\n\n                                   -6-\n\faccording to its terms and conditions.”3                  Acosta contends that the\n\nwaiver does not apply to the U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b) enhancement\n\nbecause the enhancement was not a term or a condition of the plea\n\nagreement.\n\n               In    Section      7,   the    agreement     addresses    “Sentencing\n\nGuideline Calculations” and provides specific sentencing terms and\n\nconditions.          The government and Acosta agreed to a base offense\n\nlevel, an upward adjustment based on the amount of the loss, an\n\nincrease in the base offense level due to a violation of § 1956,\n\nand a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.                         They\n\nalso       agreed,    at    Subsection       7(d),   that   at   the    time   of    the\n\nsentencing, they would each argue their differing positions on the\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b) enhancement issue.                    In Subsection 7(f), the\n\nparties       agreed       that   Acosta’s     total   offense    level    would     be\n\n“determined at sentencing based on the Court’s ruling on certain\n\nsentencing factors.”\n\n               At the sentencing hearing, the government and Acosta\n\npresented evidence and argument concerning the enhancement issue,\n\nas contemplated by the plea agreement.                  No issue has been raised\n\n\n\n       3\n      We have previously determined that the same waiver provision\nis “simple and easily understood” and “clear and self-evident on\nits face.” United States v. Borrero-Acevedo, 533 F.3d 11, 14 & 17\n(1st Cir. 2008), cert. denied, --- S. Ct. ---, 2008 WL 4580034\n(Nov. 10, 2008). Nevertheless, the frequency of appeals involving\nwaivers suggests that waiver provisions should make specific\nreference to any terms and conditions of the plea agreement that\nare not intended by the parties to be covered by the waiver.\nHopefully, such specificity would reduce the number of appeals in\nwhich plea agreement waivers are at issue.\n\n                                             -7-\n\fhere challenging the adequacy of Acosta’s opportunity to be heard\n\nduring the hearing.            The court ruled, based on the evidence and\n\narguments presented during the sentencing hearing, that Acosta knew\n\nthe laundered funds were illegal drug proceeds.                     Based on its\n\nruling, the court imposed a six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. §\n\n2S1.1(b).\n\n             Taking the language of the plea agreement as a whole,\n\nthere   is   nothing      to    suggest    that    the   parties’   agreement   at\n\nSubsection 7(d), to argue the enhancement issue at the sentencing\n\nhearing, was not a term or condition of the plea agreement.\n\nFurther, the agreement did not guarantee a particular outcome on\n\nthe enhancement issue and instead provided that the total offense\n\nlevel would be determined at sentencing, based on the court’s\n\nruling on certain sentencing factors, which were left to the\n\ndiscretion of the court.           In imposing sentence after the parties\n\nhad the opportunity to argue the enhancement issue, the court\n\ncomplied     with   the    condition      agreed    to   in   Subsection   7(d).\n\nTherefore, the sentence, including the six-level enhancement under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b)(1), was imposed according to the terms and\n\nconditions of the plea agreement.\n\n                                 III.     Conclusion\n\n             For the foregoing reasons, Acosta’s waiver is both valid\n\nand   enforceable    as    to     the   enhancement      issue,   and   therefore,\n\nappellate consideration of that issue, on the merits, is barred.\n\n             The appeal is dismissed.\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f",

On appeal, he contends that the district court erred in adding a six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b)(1) and that the waiver provision in his plea <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2</span> agreement does not bar his appeal. The government contends that the appeal should be dismissed because Acosta waived his right to appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>In April of 2005, indictments were returned in two cases charging Acosta, his wife, and others with conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h), substantive money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a), and conspiracy to import narcotics in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 952 and § 963. After the cases were consolidated, Acosta pled guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of money laundering. In pleading guilty, Acosta admitted that from August of 2002 through January of 2005, and from December of 2002 to October of 2004, he conspired with others to conduct financial transactions involving the proceeds of illegal drug dealings, that the transactions were designed to conceal the source of the proceeds, and that he knew the proceeds were from unlawful activity in violation of § 1956(h).<sup>[1]</sup> He also admitted that on September 25, 2003, he engaged in laundering $139,426.00 in violation of § 1956(a)(1)(B)(I) and § 1956(a)(2).</p>\n<p>Acosta's plea agreement recited the maximum penalties applicable to those counts, warned that the court was not bound by the plea agreement, and stated that the sentence would be left to the court's discretion. Acosta and the government agreed to advisory guideline sentencing calculations that provided a base offense level of eight, a twelve-level upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1)(G), a two-level increase because of the violation of § 1956, and a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1. They did not agree on an adjusted offense level, and the agreement stated that Acosta's total offense level would be determined by the court at sentencing based upon the court's rulings on \"certain sentencing factors.\"</p>\n<p>The plea agreement further provided that at sentencing the government would argue in favor of a six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b), while Acosta would argue against the enhancement. The agreement included a provision titled \"WAIVER OF APPEAL,\" which provided that \"[t]he defendant hereby agrees that if this Honorable Court accepts this agreement and sentences hi[m] according to its terms and conditions, defendant waives and surrenders [his] right to appeal the conviction and sentence in this case.\"</p>\n<p>The sentencing hearing took place over a period of four days. The court addressed the enhancement issue under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b), which provides for an increase of six levels if the defendant knew or believed that any of the laundered funds were the proceeds of, among other things, an offense involving illegal drugs. The government presented the testimony of two DEA undercover agents, Diaz and Rivera, who participated in the investigation that led to Acosta's arrest. They testified about the money laundering operations and the circumstances that implicated Acosta. In particular, the agents testified about Acosta's involvement, with his wife, in delivering large amounts of cash on three occasions.</p>\n<p>Acosta also testified at the hearing. He admitted that he knew the money was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> obtained unlawfully, but he denied any knowledge of the source of the money. He also denied the circumstances described by Agent Rivera, which suggested that he would have knowledge that the money was drug proceeds.</p>\n<p>Based on the evidence presented during the sentencing hearing, the court concluded that Acosta's testimony, denying knowledge of the source of the money, was not credible. The court credited Agent Rivera's testimony and concluded, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Acosta knew the money he delivered for laundering was illegal drug proceeds. The court imposed a six-level enhancement under § 2S1.1(b). Acosta was sentenced to three fifty-seven month terms to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Discussion</h2>\n<p>On appeal, Acosta contends that the district court erred in applying the six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b) because the evidence did not support a finding that he knew the money he delivered for laundering was illegal drug proceeds. He argues that the waiver of appeal provision in his plea agreement does not bar his appeal because the waiver applies only to the terms and conditions of the agreement and not to the enhancement imposed at sentencing. The government asserts that the waiver applies and that the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p>Before considering the merits of Acosta's claim, we must determine whether the waiver of appeal provision is enforceable under the circumstances of this case. <i>United States v. Miliano,</i> 480 F.3d 605, 607 (1st Cir.2007). \"`[U]nder ordinary circumstances, a knowing, voluntary waiver of the right to appeal from a sentence, contained in a plea agreement, ought to be enforced.'\" <i>United States v. Cardona-Diaz,</i> 524 F.3d 20, 22 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting <i>United States v. Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d 14, 23 (1st Cir.2001)). When its validity is challenged, a waiver is tested by considering whether the waiver statement and its scope are sufficiently clear, whether the district court questioned the defendant as to his understanding of the waiver and informed him of its ramifications, and whether enforcing the waiver would cause a miscarriage of justice. <i>United States v. Chandler,</i> 534 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>In this case, however, Acosta does not challenge the validity of his waiver or assert that its enforcement would work a miscarriage of justice.<sup>[2]</sup><i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Edelen,</i> 539 F.3d 83, 85 (1st Cir.2008) (defendant argued waiver was involuntary and unknowing); <i>Chandler,</i> 534 F.3d at 49 (defendant argued district court's description of waiver inadequate); <i>Cardona-Diaz,</i> 524 F.3d at 22-23 (defendant argued miscarriage of justice). Instead, Acosta asserts that under its terms, the waiver does not apply to his appeal of the U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b) enhancement issue.</p>\n<p>\"Even a knowing and voluntary appeal waiver only precludes appeals that fall within its scope.\" <i>United States v. McCoy,</i> 508 F.3d 74, 77 (1st Cir.2007). \"[T]he scope of the waiver is simply a matter of what the parties agreed to in the particular case.\" <i>Id.</i> Plea agreements are construed under basic contract principles. <i>United States v.

The government and Acosta agreed to a base offense level, an upward adjustment based on the amount of the loss, an increase in the base offense level due to a violation of § 1956, and a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. They also agreed, at Subsection 7(d), that at the time of the sentencing, they would each argue their differing positions on the U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b) enhancement issue. In Subsection 7(f), the parties agreed that Acosta's total offense level would be \"determined at sentencing based on the Court's ruling on certain sentencing factors.\"</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, the government and Acosta presented evidence and argument concerning the enhancement issue, as contemplated by the plea agreement. No issue has been raised here challenging the adequacy of Acosta's opportunity to be heard during the hearing.

On appeal, he contends that the district court erred in adding a six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b)(1) and that the waiver provision in his plea <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2</span> agreement does not bar his appeal. The government contends that the appeal should be dismissed because Acosta waived his right to appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>In April of 2005, indictments were returned in two cases charging Acosta, his wife, and others with conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h), substantive money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a), and conspiracy to import narcotics in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 952 and § 963. After the cases were consolidated, Acosta pled guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of money laundering. In pleading guilty, Acosta admitted that from August of 2002 through January of 2005, and from December of 2002 to October of 2004, he conspired with others to conduct financial transactions involving the proceeds of illegal drug dealings, that the transactions were designed to conceal the source of the proceeds, and that he knew the proceeds were from unlawful activity in violation of § 1956(h).<sup>[1]</sup> He also admitted that on September 25, 2003, he engaged in laundering $139,426.00 in violation of § 1956(a)(1)(B)(I) and § 1956(a)(2).</p>\n<p>Acosta's plea agreement recited the maximum penalties applicable to those counts, warned that the court was not bound by the plea agreement, and stated that the sentence would be left to the court's discretion. Acosta and the government agreed to advisory guideline sentencing calculations that provided a base offense level of eight, a twelve-level upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1)(G), a two-level increase because of the violation of § 1956, and a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1. They did not agree on an adjusted offense level, and the agreement stated that Acosta's total offense level would be determined by the court at sentencing based upon the court's rulings on \"certain sentencing factors.\"</p>\n<p>The plea agreement further provided that at sentencing the government would argue in favor of a six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b), while Acosta would argue against the enhancement. The agreement included a provision titled \"WAIVER OF APPEAL,\" which provided that \"[t]he defendant hereby agrees that if this Honorable Court accepts this agreement and sentences hi[m] according to its terms and conditions, defendant waives and surrenders [his] right to appeal the conviction and sentence in this case.\"</p>\n<p>The sentencing hearing took place over a period of four days. The court addressed the enhancement issue under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b), which provides for an increase of six levels if the defendant knew or believed that any of the laundered funds were the proceeds of, among other things, an offense involving illegal drugs. The government presented the testimony of two DEA undercover agents, Diaz and Rivera, who participated in the investigation that led to Acosta's arrest. They testified about the money laundering operations and the circumstances that implicated Acosta. In particular, the agents testified about Acosta's involvement, with his wife, in delivering large amounts of cash on three occasions.</p>\n<p>Acosta also testified at the hearing. He admitted that he knew the money was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> obtained unlawfully, but he denied any knowledge of the source of the money. He also denied the circumstances described by Agent Rivera, which suggested that he would have knowledge that the money was drug proceeds.</p>\n<p>Based on the evidence presented during the sentencing hearing, the court concluded that Acosta's testimony, denying knowledge of the source of the money, was not credible. The court credited Agent Rivera's testimony and concluded, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Acosta knew the money he delivered for laundering was illegal drug proceeds. The court imposed a six-level enhancement under § 2S1.1(b). Acosta was sentenced to three fifty-seven month terms to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Discussion</h2>\n<p>On appeal, Acosta contends that the district court erred in applying the six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b) because the evidence did not support a finding that he knew the money he delivered for laundering was illegal drug proceeds. He argues that the waiver of appeal provision in his plea agreement does not bar his appeal because the waiver applies only to the terms and conditions of the agreement and not to the enhancement imposed at sentencing. The government asserts that the waiver applies and that the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p>Before considering the merits of Acosta's claim, we must determine whether the waiver of appeal provision is enforceable under the circumstances of this case. <i>United States v. Miliano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202678\"><a href=\"/opinion/202678/united-states-v-miliano/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span>, 607 (1st Cir.2007). \"`[U]nder ordinary circumstances, a knowing, voluntary waiver of the right to appeal from a sentence, contained in a plea agreement, ought to be enforced.'\" <i>United States v. Cardona-Diaz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203248\"><a href=\"/opinion/203248/united-states-v-cardona-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting <i>United States v. Teeter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199507\"><a href=\"/opinion/199507/united-states-v-teeter/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.2001)). When its validity is challenged, a waiver is tested by considering whether the waiver statement and its scope are sufficiently clear, whether the district court questioned the defendant as to his understanding of the waiver and informed him of its ramifications, and whether enforcing the waiver would cause a miscarriage of justice. <i>United States v. Chandler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203399\"><a href=\"/opinion/203399/united-states-v-chandler/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>In this case, however, Acosta does not challenge the validity of his waiver or assert that its enforcement would work a miscarriage of justice.<sup>[2]</sup><i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Edelen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1427387\"><a href=\"/opinion/1427387/united-states-v-edelen/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 85 (1st Cir.2008) (defendant argued waiver was involuntary and unknowing); <i>Chandler,</i> 534 F.3d at 49 (defendant argued district court's description of waiver inadequate); <i>Cardona-Diaz,</i> 524 F.3d at 22-23 (defendant argued miscarriage of justice). Instead, Acosta asserts that under its terms, the waiver does not apply to his appeal of the U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b) enhancement issue.</p>\n<p>\"Even a knowing and voluntary appeal waiver only precludes appeals that fall within its scope.\" <i>United States v. McCoy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203030\"><a href=\"/opinion/203030/united-states-v-mccoy/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 77 (1st Cir.2007). \"[T]he scope of the waiver is simply a matter of what the parties agreed to in the particular case.\" <i>Id.</i> Plea agreements are construed under basic contract principles. <i>United States v. Newbert,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202973\"><a href=\"/opinion/202973/united-states-v-newbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span>, 185 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The waiver provision in Acosta's plea agreement states that he waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence \"if <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> the Honorable Court accepts this agreement and sentences [Acosta] according to its terms and conditions.\"<sup>[3]</sup> Acosta contends that the waiver does not apply to the U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b) enhancement because the enhancement was not a term or a condition of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p>In Section 7, the agreement addresses \"Sentencing Guideline Calculations\" and provides specific sentencing terms and conditions. The government and Acosta agreed to a base offense level, an upward adjustment based on the amount of the loss, an increase in the base offense level due to a violation of § 1956, and a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. They also agreed, at Subsection 7(d), that at the time of the sentencing, they would each argue their differing positions on the U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b) enhancement issue. In Subsection 7(f), the parties agreed that Acosta's total offense level would be \"determined at sentencing based on the Court's ruling on certain sentencing factors.\"</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, the government and Acosta presented evidence and argument concerning the enhancement issue, as contemplated by the plea agreement. No issue has been raised here challenging the adequacy of Acosta's opportunity to be heard during the hearing. The court ruled, based on the evidence and arguments presented during the sentencing hearing, that Acosta knew the laundered funds were illegal drug proceeds. Based on its ruling, the court imposed a six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b).</p>\n<p>Taking the language of the plea agreement as a whole, there is nothing to suggest that the parties' agreement at Subsection 7(d), to argue the enhancement issue at the sentencing hearing, was not a term or condition of the plea agreement.

In imposing sentence after the parties had the opportunity to argue the enhancement issue, the court complied with the condition agreed to in Subsection 7(d). Therefore, the sentence, including the six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b)(1), was imposed according to the terms and conditions of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.
