Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          December 10, 2002\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.        Defendant-appellant, Edwin C.\n\nAllen, appeals the special conditions of his supervised release.\n\nBecause we do not find that the district court erred in imposing\n\nthe conditions, we affirm.\n\n                              I.    Background\n\n           On April 27, 2001, Allen pled guilty to a single count of\n\ntax evasion for making a false claim on a financial statement.\n\nBased upon a claim of diminished mental capacity, Allen sought a\n\ndownward departure from the sentencing range listed in the United\n\nStates Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.).1               The district court\n\nrefused his request and on November 5, 2001 sentenced him to eight\n\nmonths imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release.\n\n           Allen    makes     two   arguments    attacking    the   special\n\nconditions imposed. First, he argues that three conditions are\n\noverbroad and involve a greater deprivation of liberty than is\n\nreasonably necessary for the purposes of his supervised release.\n\nSecond, he contends that the special condition requiring that he\n\nattend   mental    health   treatment      improperly   delegates   judicial\n\nauthority to the probation officer.\n\n                        II.    Standard of Review\n\n           Ordinarily, we would review the imposition of special\n\nconditions of supervised release for abuse of discretion.             United\n\n\n1\n  Applying the 2000 Sentencing Guidelines, Judge Hornby found that\nAllen fell in the Zone C range of eight to fourteen months\nimprisonment.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fStates v. Peppe, 80 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir. 1996).    However, because\n\nAllen had an opportunity to object to the special conditions and\n\nfailed to do so, we review for plain error only.     Id.   \"The plain\n\nerror hurdle is high.     Under the standard, we may set aside the\n\nchallenged portion of the instant sentence if, and only if, the\n\nappellant succeeds in showing an obvious and clear error under\n\ncurrent law that affected his substantial rights.\"     United States\n\nv. Brown, 235 F.3d 2, 4 (1st Cir. 2000) (citations and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). However, \"[e]ven then, we may decline to\n\ncorrect an error that does not seriously affect the fairness,\n\nintegrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"      Id.\n\n                   III.   Overbreadth Challenges\n\n           U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3 governs the conditions of supervised\n\nrelease. The court may impose additional conditions where they are\n\nreasonably related to the offense and the history of the defendant,\n\nas long as they do not deprive the defendant of a greater amount\n\n\"of liberty than is reasonably necessary\" to deter criminal conduct\n\nand to protect the public from the defendant.     U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(b)\n\n(2000).2   The Federal Sentencing Commission (\"the Commission\")\n\n\n2\n    U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(b) states in its entirety:\n\n      (b) The court may impose other conditions of supervised\n      release to the extent that such conditions (1) are\n      reasonably related to (A) the nature and circumstances of\n      the offense and the history and characteristics of the\n      defendant; (B) the need for the sentence imposed to\n      afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) the\n      need to protect the public from further crimes of the\n\n                                -3-\n\fprovides a list of \"special conditions\" that it recommends in\n\nspecified circumstances. U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(d). We now consider the\n\nspecial conditions that Allen challenges.\n\n           A.     Financial Information and Credit Limitations\n\n           Allen    argues    that   the   provisions      requiring    that   he\n\n\"provide   the    probation   officer      with   access    to   any   requested\n\nfinancial information\" and limiting his ability to obtain credit\n\nare   overbroad    in   violation    of    section   5D1.3(b).3        Far   from\n\ncommitting error, the district court imposed special conditions\n\nthat the Commission specifically recommends for defendants, such as\n\nAllen, who are paying fines in installments.               U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(d)\n\n(2)-(3). Consequently, Allen has not established that the district\n\ncourt imposed these conditions in clear error.\n\n           B.     Alcohol Prohibitions\n\n           Allen next challenges the special condition prohibiting\n\nhis possession of alcohol and his presence at establishments\n\nprimarily serving alcohol.       The condition provides:\n\n\n\n\n      defendant; and (D) the need to provide the defendant with\n      needed educational or vocational training, medical care,\n      or other correctional treatment in the most effective\n      manner; and (2) involve no greater deprivation of liberty\n      than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth\n      above and are consistent with any pertinent policy\n      statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\n3\n   It is notable that the credit condition does not prevent Allen\nfrom obtaining credit; it merely requires that he gain approval\nfrom his probation officer before applying for credit.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f            Defendant shall not at any time be in\n            possession,    joint,    sole,    actual    or\n            constructive, of any alcoholic beverage. He\n            shall not associate with individuals consuming\n            alcoholic   beverages,   shall  not   frequent\n            business establishments whose primary product\n            to the consumer is alcoholic beverages, and\n            shall not use any medication containing\n            alcohol without permission from the probation\n            officer or a prescription from a licensed\n            physician.\n\nAllen argues that the condition is overbroad and that there is not\n\nan adequate relationship between the nature and circumstances of\n\nhis offense and the special condition imposed.\n\n            Allen has not shown that the alcohol condition is so\n\nbroadly drawn or divorced from the nature and circumstances of his\n\noffense that it constitutes clear error. The record contains ample\n\nevidence    of   Allen's   history    of   alcohol   abuse,   including   a\n\nconviction for driving while under the influence of alcohol.              In\n\naddition,   defense   counsel   argued     that   Allen's   mental   illness\n\ncontributed to the commission of his crime, and that Allen's abuse\n\nof alcohol exacerbated the symptoms of the mental illness.             Based\n\non the record, the district court did not commit obvious error in\n\nconcluding that Allen's history of alcohol abuse required a stiff\n\nprohibition,4 see United States v. Thurlow, 44 F.3d 46, 47 (1st\n\nCir. 1995) (upholding a special condition prohibiting the use and\n\npossession of alcohol where the record showed a history of alcohol\n\n\n\n4\n   Allen can petition for a change in the condition if it is\napplied unreasonably. See 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e).\n\n                                     -5-\n\fabuse), and that there was \"an adequate relationship between the\n\nnature     and     circumstances        of    the        offense,   the    demonstrated\n\npropensities of the offender and the special condition attached to\n\nthe offender's release,\" Brown, 235 F.3d at 7.                       Far from erring,\n\nthe   district      court     created    an    alcohol        prohibition       reasonably\n\nrelated to Allen's history of alcohol abuse and to permissible\n\ngoals of supervised release, including Allen's rehabilitation and\n\nprotection of the public.\n\n                             IV.   Delegation Argument\n\n            Finally, Allen claims that Judge Hornby impermissibly\n\ndelegated judicial authority to the probation officer when he\n\nordered,    as     a   special     condition        of    supervised      release,   that\n\n\"[d]efendant shall participate in a program of mental health\n\ntreatment, as directed by the probation officer, until such time as\n\nthe defendant          is   released    from       the    program   by    the   probation\n\nofficer.\"         According to Allen, this condition is an unlawful\n\ndelegation because it empowers the probation officer to decide\n\nwhether and for how long Allen must participate in mental health\n\ntreatment.\n\n            While \"[c]ases or controversies committed to Art. III\n\ncourts     cannot       be    delegated        to        nonjudicial      officers     for\n\nresolution[,] [t]hat general principle does not . . . prohibit\n\ncourts     from    using      nonjudicial          officers    to   support       judicial\n\nfunctions, as long as that judicial officer retains and exercises\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\fultimate responsibility.\"       United States v. Johnson, 48 F.3d 806,\n\n809 (4th Cir. 1995); see also United States v. Raddatz, 477 U.S.\n\n667, 683 (1980) (holding that \"so long as the ultimate decision is\n\nmade by the district court,\" delegation to a magistrate judge does\n\nnot violate Article III); cf. United States v. Merric, 166 F.3d\n\n406, 409 (1st Cir. 1999) (vacating a sentence in which the judge\n\ndelegated final authority over defendant's fine payment schedule to\n\nthe probation officer). Allen relies on cases outside this Circuit\n\nfor his claim that this special condition amounted to an unlawful\n\ndelegation.       See United States v. Peterson, 248 F.3d 79 (2d Cir.\n\n2001); United States v. Kent, 209 F.3d 1073 (8th Cir. 2000).\n\nUnlike Allen, we do not read these opinions as announcing -- nor do\n\nwe adopt -- a general rule that counseling clauses such as the one\n\nbefore   us   are    prohibited.     However,    these   cases   do   provide\n\npersuasive guidance for the proposition that special conditions of\n\nprobation should be evaluated in light of the facts of the case as\n\nreflected by the entire record.            In Kent, the Eighth Circuit\n\nvacated the district court's imposition of a special condition\n\nrequiring the defendant to attend psychological counseling because\n\nit appeared that the \"probation officer, as opposed to the court,\n\nwould    retain     and   exercise   ultimate   responsibility    over    the\n\nsituation.\"       Kent, 209 F.3d at 1079.       Crucially, the court made\n\nthis determination after examining the entire record and finding\n\nboth that the trial judge had stated outright that the parole\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fofficer would be the one to determine whether defendant had to\n\nattend counseling and that the record did not demonstrate that the\n\ndefendant had mental health problems.            Id. at 1075, 1078-79.\n\nCiting to Kent, the Second Circuit provided a concise rule for\n\ndelegations of psychiatric counseling:\n\n             If [the defendant] is required to participate\n             in a mental health intervention only if\n             directed to do so by his probation officer,\n             then this special condition constitutes an\n             impermissible delegation of judicial authority\n             to the probation officer. On the other hand,\n             if the District Court was intending nothing\n             more than to delegate to the probation officer\n             details with respect to the selection and\n             schedule of the program, such delegation was\n             proper.\n\nPeterson, 248 F.3d at 85 (citations omitted).\n\n             When we examine the record, it becomes evident that Judge\n\nHornby was merely directing the probation officer to perform\n\nministerial support services and was not giving the officer the\n\npower   to   determine   whether   Allen   had   to   attend   psychiatric\n\ncounseling.     The record contains many references to Allen's mental\n\nillness.     For example, defense counsel submitted an affidavit from\n\nAllen's doctor, Ronald S. Ebert, who \"found that there was a\n\nhistory suggestive of a mental illness as well as alcohol abuse\"\n\nand opined that Allen was \"suffering from a major depressive\n\ndisorder characterized by mood disorder, depression, disorganized\n\nand confused thinking, anxiety and irritability.\" Defense counsel\n\nstated Dr. Stephanie Brody diagnosed Allen with \"affective mental\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fillness.\"        Defense counsel argued that Allen's mental illness\n\ncontributed to the commission of Allen's crime and asked the court\n\nto impose mental health treatment as a condition of probation, if\n\nthe court agreed to a reduction in his sentence.             The extensive\n\nevidence of Allen's mental illness indicates that the court was\n\nimposing mandatory counseling and delegating the administrative\n\ndetails     to    the   probation   officer,     actions   constituting   a\n\npermissible delegation.       See Peterson, 248 F.3d at 85.\n\n                              V.    Conclusion\n\n            For the reasons stated above, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f",

United States v. Merric,</i> 166 F.3d 406, 409 (1st Cir.1999) (vacating a sentence in which the judge delegated final authority over defendant's fine payment schedule to the probation officer). Allen relies on cases outside this Circuit for his claim that this special condition amounted to an unlawful delegation. <i>See United States v. Peterson,</i> 248 F.3d 79 (2d Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Kent,</i> 209 F.3d 1073 (8th Cir.2000). Unlike Allen, we do not read these opinions as announcing &#8212; nor do we adopt &#8212; a general rule that counseling clauses such as the one before us are prohibited. However, these cases do provide persuasive guidance for the proposition that special conditions of probation should be evaluated in light of the facts of the case as reflected by the entire record. In <i>Kent,</i> the Eighth Circuit vacated the district court's imposition of a special condition requiring the defendant to attend psychological counseling because it appeared that the \"probation officer, as opposed to the court, would retain and exercise ultimate responsibility over the situation.\" <i>Kent,</i> 209 F.3d at 1079. Crucially, the court made this determination after examining the entire record and finding both that the trial judge had stated outright that the parole officer would be the one to determine whether defendant had to attend counseling and that the record did not demonstrate that the defendant had mental health problems. <i>Id.</i> at 1075, 1078-79. Citing to <i>Kent,</i> the Second Circuit provided a concise rule for delegations of psychiatric counseling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If [the defendant] is required to participate in a mental health intervention only if directed to do so by his probation officer, then this special condition constitutes an impermissible delegation of judicial authority to the probation officer. On the other hand, if the District Court was intending nothing more than to delegate to the probation officer details with respect to the selection and schedule of the program, such delegation was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Peterson,</i> 248 F.3d at 85 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we examine the record, it becomes evident that Judge Hornby was merely directing the probation officer to perform ministerial support services and was not giving the officer the power to determine whether Allen had to attend psychiatric counseling. The record contains many references to Allen's mental illness. For example, defense counsel submitted an affidavit from Allen's doctor, Ronald S. Ebert, who \"found that there was a history suggestive of a mental illness as well as alcohol abuse\" and opined that Allen was \"suffering from a major depressive disorder characterized by mood disorder, depression, disorganized and confused thinking, anxiety and irritability.\" Defense counsel stated Dr. Stephanie Brody diagnosed Allen with \"affective mental illness.\" Defense counsel argued that Allen's mental illness contributed to the commission of Allen's crime and asked the court to impose mental health treatment as a condition of probation, if the court agreed to a reduction in his sentence. The extensive evidence of Allen's mental illness indicates that the court was imposing mandatory counseling and delegating the administrative details to the probation officer, actions constituting a permissible delegation. <i>See Peterson,</i> 248 F.3d at 85.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">V.

Allen, appeals the special conditions of his supervised release. Because we do not find that the district court erred in imposing the conditions, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 27, 2001, Allen pled guilty to a single count of tax evasion for making a false claim on a financial statement. Based upon a claim of diminished mental capacity, Allen sought a downward departure from the sentencing range listed in the United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The district court refused his request and on November 5, 2001 sentenced him to eight months imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allen makes two arguments attacking the special conditions imposed. First, he argues that three conditions are overbroad and involve a greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for the purposes of his supervised release. Second, he contends that the special condition requiring that he attend mental health treatment improperly delegates judicial authority to the probation officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, we would review the imposition of special conditions of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Peppe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196672\"><a href=\"/opinion/196672/united-states-v-peppe/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1996). However, because Allen had an opportunity to object to the special conditions and failed to do so, we review for plain error only. <i>Id.</i> \"The plain error hurdle is high. Under the standard, we may set aside the challenged portion of the instant sentence if, and only if, the appellant succeeds in showing an obvious and clear error under current law that affected his substantial rights.\" <i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199192\"><a href=\"/opinion/199192/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2000) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). However, \"[e]ven then, we may decline to correct an error that does not seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Overbreadth Challenges</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3 governs the conditions of supervised release. The court may impose additional conditions where they are reasonably related to the offense and the history of the defendant, as long as they do not deprive the defendant of a greater amount \"of liberty than is reasonably necessary\" to deter criminal conduct and to protect the public from the defendant. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(b) (2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Federal Sentencing Commission (\"the Commission\") provides a list of \"special conditions\" that it recommends in specified circumstances. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(d). We now consider the special conditions that Allen challenges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Financial Information and Credit Limitations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allen argues that the provisions requiring that he \"provide the probation officer with access to any requested financial information\" and limiting his ability to obtain credit are overbroad in violation of section 5D1.3(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Far from committing error, the district court imposed special conditions that the Commission specifically recommends for defendants, such as Allen, who are paying fines in installments. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(d)(2)-(3). Consequently, Allen has not established that the district court imposed these conditions in clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Alcohol Prohibitions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allen next challenges the special condition prohibiting his possession of alcohol and his presence at establishments primarily serving alcohol. The condition provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant shall not at any time be in possession, joint, sole, actual or constructive, of any alcoholic beverage. He shall not associate with individuals consuming alcoholic beverages, shall not frequent business establishments whose primary product to the consumer is alcoholic beverages, and shall not use any medication containing alcohol without permission from the probation officer or a prescription from a licensed physician.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allen argues that the condition is overbroad and that there is not an adequate relationship between the nature and circumstances of his offense and the special condition imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allen has not shown that the alcohol condition is so broadly drawn or divorced from the nature and circumstances of his offense that it constitutes clear error. The record contains ample evidence of Allen's history of alcohol abuse, including a conviction for driving while under the influence of alcohol. In addition, defense counsel argued that Allen's mental illness contributed to the commission of his crime, and that Allen's abuse of alcohol exacerbated the symptoms of the mental illness. Based on the record, the district court did not commit obvious error in concluding that Allen's history of alcohol abuse required a stiff prohibition,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>see United States v. Thurlow,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195843\"><a href=\"/opinion/195843/united-states-v-thurlow/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.1995) (upholding a special condition prohibiting the use and possession of alcohol where the record showed a history of alcohol abuse), and that there was \"an adequate relationship between the nature and circumstances of the offense, the demonstrated propensities of the offender and the special condition attached to the offender's release,\" <i>Brown,</i> 235 F.3d at 7. Far from erring, the district court created an alcohol prohibition reasonably related to Allen's history of alcohol abuse and to permissible goals of supervised release, including Allen's rehabilitation and protection of the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Delegation Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Allen claims that Judge Hornby impermissibly delegated judicial authority to the probation officer when he ordered, as a special condition of supervised release, that \"[d]efendant shall participate in a program of mental health treatment, as directed by the probation officer, until such time as the defendant is released from the program by the probation officer.\" According to Allen, this condition is an unlawful delegation because it empowers the probation officer to decide whether and for how long Allen must participate in mental health treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While \"[c]ases or controversies committed to Art. III courts cannot be delegated to nonjudicial officers for resolution[,][t]hat general principle does not ... prohibit courts from using nonjudicial officers to support judicial functions, as long as that judicial officer retains and exercises ultimate responsibility.\" <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"690293\"><a href=\"/opinion/690293/united-states-v-victoria-kaye-johnson-aka-victoria-kaye-southern/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span>, 809 (4th Cir.1995); <i>see also United States v.

Allen relies on cases outside this Circuit for his claim that this special condition amounted to an unlawful delegation. <i>See United States v.

Unlike Allen, we do not read these opinions as announcing &#8212; nor do we adopt &#8212; a general rule that counseling clauses such as the one before us are prohibited. However, these cases do provide persuasive guidance for the proposition that special conditions of probation should be evaluated in light of the facts of the case as reflected by the entire record.
