Espinosa on brief for petitioners.\n     Peter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, James E. Grimes,\nSenior Litigation Counsel, and Scott Rempell, Trial Attorney,\nOffice of Immigration Litigation, United States Department of\nJustice, on brief for respondents.\n\n\n                             March 19, 2008\n\n\n\n*\n Pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Michael B.\nMukasey is substituted for former Attorney General Alberto R.\nGonzales as respondent.\n**\n     Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f             HOWARD, Circuit Judge.   Genario Vicente de Oliveira and\n\nhis son Ricardo Lemos Neiva petition this court to review the\n\ndecision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The BIA upheld\n\nthe determination of an Immigration Judge (IJ) that the two men\n\nwere not entitled to withholding of removal or protection under the\n\nConvention Against Torture (CAT).1      Because the BIA upheld the IJ\n\nwithout its own written opinion, it is considered to have adopted\n\nthe decision of the IJ.      Guillaume v. Gonzalez, 504 F.3d 68, 72\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).     Discerning substantial evidence in the record to\n\nsupport the BIA's determination, we deny the petition.\n\n             De Oliveira is a former candidate for mayor of Cuparaque,\n\nBrazil.     During the campaign he received death threats from those\n\nclose to the incumbent.      After he lost the election, de Oliveira\n\nreceived more threats, which stopped when he left Cuparaque to stay\n\nwith his brother.      Upon his return he was threatened again, and\n\nthen the threats subsided for the four months before de Oliveira\n\nleft for the United States.      De Oliveira claims the threats also\n\npromised violence to his children.\n\n             \"This court reviews BIA decisions under the deferential\n\nsubstantial evidence standard.     The BIA's decision will be upheld\n\nif supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.\"      Carcamo-Recinos v. Ashcroft,\n\n\n\n1\n    Neither man sought asylum, as those claims were time-barred.\n\n                                  -2-\n\f389 F.3d 253, 256 (1st Cir. 2004).         In order to qualify for\n\nwithholding of removal, de Oliveira would need to prove that it is\n\nmore likely than not that he will face persecution should he return\n\nto Brazil.    INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 419 (1999).   This\n\nshowing can be made by proving past persecution, which raises a\n\nrebuttable presumption of the likelihood of future persecution.\n\nJournal v. Keisler, 507 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2007).   To qualify for\n\nprotection under the CAT, de Oliveira would need to prove it more\n\nlikely than not that he would suffer torture at the hands of the\n\ngovernment or with the consent or acquiescence of the government.\n\nRomilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n             Substantial evidence in the record supports the IJ's\n\ndetermination that de Oliveira has proved neither past persecution\n\nnor a likelihood of future persecution.       In particular, the IJ\n\nfound that the death threats were never accompanied by overt\n\naction, that they were not escalating in nature, and that they\n\nstopped both for the \"couple months\" that de Oliveira left town\n\nafter the election, and for the four months that he was winding up\n\nhis affairs and preparing to move to the United States.     As for a\n\nlikelihood of future persecution, the IJ noted that another son of\n\nde Oliveira has been living in Brazil since April 2005 without\n\nharm.   That son was active in de Oliveira's campaign.    Similarly,\n\nde Oliveira's wife and two of their other children had remained in\n\nBrazil throughout this time and were not harmed.    \"[T]he fact that\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fclose relatives continue to live peacefully in the alien's homeland\n\nundercuts the alien's claim that persecution awaits his return.\"\n\nAguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 573 (1st Cir. 1999), cited by\n\nRomilus, 385 F.3d at 8.    This is particularly true, where, as here,\n\nthe threats explicitly contemplated harm to the children.             Also,\n\nthe IJ found that the cessation of threats while de Oliveira was\n\nvisiting his brother in another town meant that he could indeed\n\nsafely return to Brazil, even if persecution awaited him in the\n\nsingle town of Cuparaque. Finally, the IJ found that Cuparaque has\n\na new mayor, who would presumably not have the same interest in\n\nprosecuting a vendetta on behalf of the old mayor, if indeed one\n\nexisted. This substantial evidence in support of the IJ's decision\n\nends the matter.\n\n             The IJ correctly noted that because de Oliveira had\n\nfailed to prove it more likely than not that he would be harmed, he\n\nhas necessarily failed to prove it more likely than not that he\n\nwould   be   tortured.    Thus,   the    BIA's   denial   of   petition   for\n\nprotection must be upheld.\n\n             Neiva predicates his claims on those of his father.          For\n\nhis part, he has never been threatened or harmed, and his fears\n\ncenter on the likelihood of reprisals against his father.                 His\n\nclaims therefore fall with his father's.\n\n             The petitions for review are denied.         It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f",
