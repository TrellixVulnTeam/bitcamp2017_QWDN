Vicente-González for appellee Municipality of San\nJuan.\n\n\n                          January 20, 2004\n\f              BOUDIN,    Chief     Judge.     This   appeal       arises   from   the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of a personal injury lawsuit. The basis\n\nfor the dismissal was the district court's finding of fraud in the\n\nconduct of the litigation.          Because the finding of fraud as well as\n\nthe remedy adopted by the district court are contested on appeal,\n\nwe begin with a bare-bones summary of what happened, reserving some\n\nof the details until discussion of the issues raised on appeal.\n\n              On November 8, 1999, Andrew K. Hull of California was\n\nvisiting San Juan, Puerto Rico, on a business trip.                  While walking\n\nthrough   a    city     sidewalk    site    that   was    under    repair,   Andrew\n\nallegedly caught his foot on a raised piece of wire mesh and fell\n\nheavily, hitting his face and left arm.                  He proceeded to dinner\n\nbut, still feeling pain in his left elbow, visited a local hospital\n\nthereafter where x-rays revealed a fracture of the elbow and lesser\n\ninjury to the nose.         Andrew attended business meetings over the\n\nnext three days and then returned to California.\n\n              After his return, Andrew allegedly experienced a range of\n\nsymptoms, consulted a number of doctors, and underwent several\n\nsurgeries.      One was to repair a nasal obstruction and deviated\n\nseptum; others were spinal operations to relieve spinal cord\n\ncompression and repair an extruded disc and related conditions.\n\nCarpal-Tunnel syndrome was diagnosed in both wrists, and surgery as\n\nto both to relieve this condition ensued.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f            Andrew also complained of mental and emotional problems,\n\nincluding     poor   memory,   sleeplessness,     depression,     fatigue,\n\nheadaches and sexual dysfunction.          After testing, a neurologist\n\nfound that Andrew suffered from post-concussion syndrome. Although\n\nAndrew had not lost consciousness at the time of the fall, the\n\nneurologist    opined   that   the   syndrome   could    nevertheless   have\n\nresulted from the fall and the doctor prescribed treatments.\n\n            In due course, Andrew and Patricia, his wife, filed this\n\ndiversity action in the federal district court in Puerto Rico,\n\nagainst the municipality, the contractor working on the sidewalk,\n\nand the contractor's insurer.        The complaint, charging negligence,\n\nattributed to the accident the physical and mental impairments\n\nalready described as well as a few other symptoms (e.g., rotator\n\ncuff injury, aphasia) and loss of income.               On his own behalf,\n\nAndrew sought $2 million in damages.\n\n            Patricia claimed separately for loss of income (due to\n\nthe need to care for Andrew) and mental anguish.          Her claim was for\n\n$300,000.     An additional $561,000 was sought by the \"conjugal\n\npartnership,\" a community property concept recognized under the law\n\nof Puerto Rico, e.g., Fernandez-Cerra v. Commercial Ins. Co. of\n\nNewark, 344 F. Supp. 314, 316 (D.P.R. 1972); but no separate\n\nargument has been offered on appeal as to its claim, and we\n\ntherefore disregard it.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f          Extensive discovery was conducted by the defendants over\n\nmany months.      Andrew did not reveal, in response to questions\n\nfairly seeking this information, facts about his prior injuries and\n\ntreatment--until the defense uncovered this information on its own.\n\nThese included a rear-end automobile collision in 1982 in which\n\nAndrew suffered back injuries; a neck injury in 1995 leading to a\n\ndiagnosis of nerve injury (neuropathy); and a 1996 slip and fall\n\nincident in an Orlando, Florida, hotel, resulting among other\n\nthings in a diagnosis of Carpal-Tunnel syndrome.\n\n          The information was patently material.   Various symptoms\n\nand conditions associated with Andrew's earlier injuries overlapped\n\nwith those that he claimed had resulted from the more recent fall\n\nin Puerto Rico.    This is obvious with respect to the Carpal-Tunnel\n\nsyndrome but, in addition, the rear-end collision in 1982 was a\n\npossible source of some of the spinal damage, and nerve injury and\n\nsleep problems had been claimed as a result of one or both of the\n\nother two earlier accidents.\n\n          When taxed about these omissions, Andrew's position was\n\nthat in the heat of his deposition he had not remembered any of\n\nthese incidents or claims.    As to their absence from interrogatory\n\nanswers, Andrew said that defendants had not asked the right\n\nquestions.   The defendants moved for dismissal of the case on the\n\nground that the litigation was being perpetrated through fraud.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f           In October 2002, the district court granted the motion\n\nand dismissed the case in a 23-page opinion and order, analyzing in\n\ndetail Andrew's answers to interrogatories, deposition questions\n\nand in affidavit statements.            The district judge concluded \"by\n\nclear and convincing evidence\" that Andrew had committed fraud,\n\nsaid that the proper remedy was a matter of discretion, and\n\nconcluded that \"weighing all of the circumstances in this case,\"\n\ndismissal was the proper sanction \"commensurate with Mr. Hull's\n\nconduct\" and to deter future misconduct.\n\n           On this appeal, the plaintiffs make three different\n\nclaims of error: that the fraud finding was not supported by clear\n\nand convincing evidence; that dismissal was not an appropriate\n\nsanction; and that--independent of these arguments--dismissal of\n\nPatricia's claims for her own mental anguish and economic expense\n\nwas not supported by any independent finding of fraud on her part.\n\nWe reject the first two claims but conclude that a remand is\n\nrequired      to     determine   whether      Patricia's    claims    should   be\n\ndismissed.\n\n           The first question is whether Andrew engaged in a pattern\n\nof deliberate deception in the course of discovery.                  It is common\n\nground that clear and convincing evidence is required, Aoude v.\n\nMobil Oil Corp., 892 F.2d 1115, 1118 (1st Cir. 1989).                On the other\n\nhand,   the        district   court's   findings     as    to   whether   Andrew\n\ndishonestly withheld information are reviewed only for \"clear\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\ferror.\"    Cavallaro v. United States,         284 F.3d 236, 245 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).    (The phrase \"abuse of discretion\" is sometimes used, e.g.,\n\nAoude,    892    F.2d   at   1117-18,    but   the   phrasing    makes     little\n\ndifference.)\n\n            It is clear that Andrew failed to disclose the prior\n\ninjuries when specifically asked for such information during his\n\ndeposition and that the omissions were material. The harder issue,\n\nusually the sticking point in perjury and fraud cases, is Andrew's\n\nstate of mind which–-absent a confession–-must be inferred from\n\ncircumstances.        Here, several circumstances combine to reinforce\n\nthe district court's finding of scienter.\n\n            First, the information was squarely sought.                  In his\n\ndeposition, Andrew was asked directly about his prior medical\n\nhistory and failed to reveal any of the three prior incidents.                All\n\nthree of the prior incidents were serious and sufficiently related\n\nto the current claim of injuries, so that it is unlikely that even\n\none would have been forgotten.            That all three would have been\n\nforgotten through happenstance or distraction strains belief. And,\n\ngiven Andrew's obvious self-interest to enlarge his potential\n\ndamages, the inference of deliberate deceit is hard to escape.\n\n            Second, there is a broader pattern of deceit.                     For\n\nexample, when the Orlando incident was unearthed by the defense,\n\nAndrew gave answers as to his medical treatment omitting the\n\ndiagnosis       of   Carpal-Tunnel   syndrome;       and   he   withheld     such\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\finformation   from   his   own   doctor   in   this   case,   reducing   the\n\nlikelihood that it would be discovered.          Andrew also appears to\n\nhave lied when he answered an interrogatory by saying that all of\n\nhis present claimed injuries were the result of the fall in San\n\nJuan, although this might be a closer question.1\n\n            Third, Andrew was not a neophyte.         He was the president\n\nof a firm named \"Settlement Associates\" which sells insurance and\n\nstructured settlements to law firms and other companies.          His wife\n\nwas a claims manager for State Farm Insurance Company.            Further,\n\nhis prior injuries had resulted in a range of doctor and hospital\n\nvisits over a substantial period, and he could not have avoided\n\nlearning a good deal about the causes and nature of his prior\n\ninjuries.\n\n            We find no clear error in the district court's finding\n\nthat Andrew's fraud was proved by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nIt is easy enough to forget details of one's past; and possibly\n\nAndrew did suffer some impairment in the fall affecting his memory.\n\nBut the information withheld was too patent and too convenient, and\n\nthe pattern of deceit and grudging concessions too marked, to\n\nexcuse the misstatements and omissions as merely careless.\n\n\n\n     1\n      The defense relies upon Andrew's negative answers to two\ninterrogatory questions dealing with medical history; but one\n(strangely) arguably excluded \"personal injury\" and the other\nrelated to post-claim accident injuries or illnesses.     Yet in\nresponse to the latter, Andrew incautiously added that \"all\" his\npresent injuries were due to the San Juan accident.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f           The next question is whether a district court has power\n\nto dismiss a complaint because the plaintiff lies substantially and\n\nmaterially in the course of discovery. In our own circuit, fraud--\n\nat least of a kind sometimes called \"fraud on the court\"2--is a\n\npotential basis for dismissing a claim on the facts where\n\n           a party has sentiently set in motion some\n           unconscionable scheme calculated to interfere\n           with the judicial system's ability impartially\n           to   adjudicate   a   matter   by   improperly\n           influencing the trier or unfairly hampering\n           the presentation of the opposing party's claim\n           or defense.\n\n\nAoude, 892 F.2d at 1118-19.     There is similar case law in other\n\ncircuits. Shepherd v. Am. Broad. Cos., 62 F.3d 1469, 1476-78 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1995); Wyle v. R.J. Reynolds Indus., 709 F.2d 585, 589 (9th\n\nCir. 1983).\n\n           Although not so terrible as attempted bribery of a judge,\n\nAndrew's   conduct   fits   within    the   Aoude   category.   It   was\n\ndeliberate, broad enough to constitute a scheme, unconscionable,\n\nand calculated to enhance damages, thus unfairly hampering the\n\ndefense.   The unfairness was two-fold: the scope of the injuries\n\n\n\n     2\n      The \"fraud on the court\" phrase is also sometimes used in\ndrawing distinctions in the quite different context of reopening\nfinal judgments--especially in distinguishing between fraud that\nmust be presented within one year of the judgment and fraud that\ncan be invoked later under the savings clause of Fed. R. Civ. P.\n60(b). Compare 11 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure,\n§ 2860 (2d ed. 1995) (discussing Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(3) (\"fraud,\n. . . misrepresentation or other misconduct\") with id. § 2870\n(discussing \"fraud on the court\" under the savings clause).\n\n                                     -8-\n\fattributable to Andrew's fall in Puerto Rico was likely to be the\n\nmain issue in the case, and, in the nature of things, past medical\n\ninformation is peculiarly within the privileged control of the\n\nplaintiff.    The same conduct might not necessarily be enough to\n\nreopen a final judgment after one year, Geo. P. Reintjes Co., Inc.\n\nv. Riley Stoker Corp., 71 F.3d 44, 47-49 (1st Cir. 1995), but\n\nfinality of long-standing judgments is a different matter than\n\ndismissal of a current complaint.\n\n          That a remedy is in principle available does not mean\n\nthat its use is reasonable in all circumstances.      Here, plaintiffs\n\nmake both a substantive and a procedural objection.        The first is\n\nthat it was unreasonable to use so extreme a remedy as dismissal,\n\nespecially where the defense ultimately gained the information and\n\nlesser remedies were available.     The second is that the district\n\ncourt erred by not specifically considering the pros and cons of\n\nalternative lesser remedies.    Both are uphill arguments, given the\n\ntrial judge's special competence in judging the extent of the\n\nmisbehavior and its effects.   Young v. Gordon, 330 F.3d 76, 81 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n          Starting   with   substance,   the   sanction   was   obviously\n\nsevere and lesser sanctions were available. For example, the court\n\ncould have debarred Andrew from presenting certain claims of\n\ninjury, underscored the jury's ability to draw negative inferences\n\nfrom his deceits, or both.     And while the deceits imposed extra\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fexpenses on the defense, an award of attorney's fees and costs\n\ncould have been treated as sufficiently offsetting this damage.\n\n            On the other hand, dismissing only the affected claims of\n\ninjury would have wiped out most of the main damage claims anyway,\n\nwhile inference drawing would be available without a sanction and\n\ncould be pretty mild in effect if Andrew were nimble on cross-\n\nexamination. His deceits were substantial, deliberate, and went to\n\nthe heart of the case.    And since not everyone will be caught, the\n\npenalty needs to be severe enough to deter.        In the choice of\n\nremedy, there was no abuse of discretion--the proper test as to\n\nremedy.     Aoude, 892 F.2d at 1117; Fernandez v. Leonard, 963 F.2d\n\n459, 462 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n            As for procedure, plaintiffs draw our attention to cases\n\nin other circuits saying that the trial judge must expressly\n\nconsider lesser alternatives before adopting the extreme remedy of\n\ndismissal; and they urge us to adopt such a rule.       Shepherd, 62\n\nF.3d at 1479; Halaco Eng'g Co. v. Costle, 843 F.2d 376, 381-82 (9th\n\nCir. 1988).    We agree that lesser remedies ought to be considered,\n\nwhere reasonably available, whenever a judge imposes the harshest\n\nsanction.     But in our view, how much consideration, and in what\n\nform depend upon the circumstances.\n\n            In this instance, the district judge did not grasp\n\nthoughtlessly for dismissal.      The choice of remedy followed a\n\ncareful study over many pages of the precise deceits and Andrew's\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fculpability; the court recognized that it had discretion as to\n\nremedy; and it said that dismissal was \"commensurate\" with Andrew's\n\nconduct    and   the   need   to   deter    \"this   type    of    behavior   from\n\nrecurring\"–-behavior that the court said went well beyond injury to\n\nan opposing litigant and threatened \"the integrity of this court.\"\n\n            Requiring    a      district    judge    to    list    and   address\n\nalternatives may sometimes make sense, for example where the judge\n\nhas ignored a seemingly superior remedy.                Occasionally it may be\n\na polite way to say that the remedy chosen is disproportionate to\n\nthe offense–-also not the case here.                How much explanation is\n\nrequired    of   the   remedy    chosen,    and   how     much   discounting    of\n\nalternatives may be warranted, depend on the facts, and to us a\n\nmindlessly mechanical rule makes no sense.                 Here, the district\n\ncourt did enough to assure reasoned consideration of the remedy.\n\n            Patricia's claims are a different matter. The subject of\n\nclaims by one who is secondarily injured is complicated, but Puerto\n\nRico law allows one spouse to recover in some cases at least for\n\nemotional distress suffered through the injury of the other spouse,\n\nSantini Rivera v. Serv Air, Inc., 137 P.R. Dec. 1, 10 (1994).                  Nor\n\ndo defendants suggest that such a claim is barred because the\n\ndirectly injured spouse is debarred from recovery by his own\n\nmisconduct in court.\n\n            Instead, defendants argue that Patricia joined actively\n\nin the fraud.     They say that she joined in the complaint asserting\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fthat her own damages were due in part to Andrew's Carpal-Tunnel\n\nsyndrome and back injuries allegedly due to the San Juan accident;\n\nthat   she    joined     by    cross       reference     her   husband's       false\n\ninterrogatory answer (\"All the injuries and treatment I had were as\n\na result of the 11-9-99 incident which is the subject of the\n\ncomplaint\"); and that when the plaintiffs were ordered by the court\n\nto disclose all of Andrew's medical history, she joined in the\n\nresponse which        failed   to   disclose      the   full   history    of   prior\n\naccidents and treatment.\n\n             Defendants then argue that Patricia must have known of\n\nthe three prior incidents of greatest importance (1982, 1995, 1996)\n\nand, given the filings made on her behalf, is equally responsible\n\nfor the deceits.        They also note that Patricia worked for many\n\nyears as a claims manager at State Farm Insurance Company and dealt\n\nwith personal injury claims, so had to understand the importance of\n\nthe omissions.    Quite possibly the district court did believe that\n\nshe was complicit in the fraud, and the evidence may well support\n\nsuch conclusion.\n\n             Still,    nowhere      does    the   district     court's    decision\n\nseparately muster evidence of Patricia's culpability or make an\n\nexpress finding that she personally engaged in or knowingly abetted\n\nthe fraud.     The single strongest evidence of fraud against Andrew\n\nis his deposition answers and we know nothing about what, if\n\nanything, Patricia said in any deposition of her own.                    The proper\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fsolution is a remand to allow the district judge to make his own\n\ndetermination   and    supporting   findings   as   to   Patricia's\n\nresponsibility for the fraud--assuming that she thinks it advisable\n\nto proceed with her claims which are now much weakened by Andrew's\n\nlack of credibility.\n\n          The plaintiffs have asked that any remand that may be\n\nnecessary should be conducted before a different judge. The ground\n\ngiven is that the district court's findings of fraud are so couched\n\nas to \"suggest[] some antipathy to [the] litigant\"; plaintiffs'\n\ncounsel says that while the \"judge [who presided in the district\n\ncourt] would, no doubt, remain an impartial and professional jurist\n\non remand,\" a new judge approaching the case \"on a fresh page\"\n\nwould be better.   The defendants oppose the request.\n\n          The statute providing for remands confers on the circuit\n\ncourts authority to make such orders \"as may be just under the\n\ncircumstances,\" 28 U.S.C. § 2106 (2000); and remand orders by the\n\ncircuit court to a different judge have been held permissible by\n\nthe Supreme Court, Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 554\n\n(1994).   But views formed by a judge in considering a case are\n\nnormally not a sound basis either for required recusal or for\n\ndirecting that a different judge be assigned on remand.     Liteky,\n\n510 U.S. at 555-56.    In this instance, nothing in the district\n\njudge's decision warrants the remedy sought by plaintiffs.\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f         The judgment of dismissal is affirmed as to the claims of\n\nAndrew Hull and the conjugal partnership.   As to the individual\n\nclaims of Patricia Hull, the judgment is vacated and the matter\n\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n\n         It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -14-\n\f",

The basis for the dismissal was the district court's finding of fraud in the conduct of the litigation. Because the finding of fraud as well as the remedy adopted by the district court are contested on appeal, we begin with a bare-bones summary of what happened, reserving some of the details until discussion of the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 8, 1999, Andrew K. Hull of California was visiting San Juan, Puerto Rico, on a business trip. While walking through a city sidewalk site that was under repair, Andrew allegedly caught his foot on a raised piece of wire mesh and fell heavily, hitting his face and left arm. He proceeded to dinner but, still feeling pain in his left elbow, visited a local hospital thereafter where x-rays revealed a fracture of the elbow and lesser injury to the nose. Andrew attended business meetings over the next three days and then returned to California.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After his return, Andrew allegedly experienced a range of symptoms, consulted a number of doctors, and underwent several surgeries. One was to repair a nasal obstruction and deviated septum; others were spinal operations to relieve spinal cord compression and repair an extruded disc and related conditions. Carpal-Tunnel syndrome was diagnosed in both wrists, and surgery as to both to relieve this condition ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andrew also complained of mental and emotional problems, including poor memory, sleeplessness, depression, fatigue, headaches and sexual dysfunction. After testing, a neurologist found that Andrew suffered from post-concussion syndrome. Although Andrew had not lost consciousness at the time of the fall, the neurologist opined that the syndrome could nevertheless have resulted from the fall and the doctor prescribed treatments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Andrew and Patricia, his wife, filed this diversity action in the federal district court in Puerto Rico, against the municipality, the contractor working on the sidewalk, and the contractor's insurer. The complaint, charging negligence, attributed to the accident the physical and mental impairments already described as well as a few other symptoms (e.g., rotator cuff injury, aphasia) and loss of income. On his own behalf, Andrew sought $2 million in damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Patricia claimed separately for loss of income (due to the need to care for Andrew) and mental anguish. Her claim was for $300,000. An additional $561,000 was sought by the \"conjugal partnership,\" a community property concept recognized under the law of Puerto Rico, <i>e.g., Fernandez-Cerra v. Commercial Ins. Co. of Newark,</i> 344 F.Supp. 314, 316 (D.P.R.1972); but no separate argument has been offered on appeal as to its claim, and we therefore disregard it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Extensive discovery was conducted by the defendants over many months. Andrew did not reveal, in response to questions fairly seeking this information, facts about his prior injuries and treatment &#8212; until the defense uncovered this information on its own. These included a rear-end automobile collision in 1982 in which Andrew suffered back injuries; a neck injury in 1995 leading to a diagnosis of nerve injury (neuropathy); and a 1996 slip and fall incident in an Orlando, Florida, hotel, resulting among other things in a diagnosis of Carpal-Tunnel syndrome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The information was patently material. Various symptoms and conditions associated with Andrew's earlier injuries overlapped with those that he claimed had resulted from the more recent fall in Puerto Rico. This is obvious with respect to the Carpal-Tunnel syndrome but, in addition, the rear-end collision in 1982 was a possible source of some of the spinal damage, and nerve injury and sleep problems had been claimed as a result of one or both of the other two earlier accidents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When taxed about these omissions, Andrew's position was that in the heat of his deposition he had not remembered any of these incidents or claims. As to their absence from interrogatory answers, Andrew said that defendants had not asked the right questions. The defendants moved for dismissal of the case on the ground that the litigation was being perpetrated through fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2002, the district court granted the motion and dismissed the case in a 23-page opinion and order, analyzing in detail Andrew's answers to interrogatories, deposition questions and in affidavit statements. The district judge concluded \"by clear and convincing evidence\" that Andrew had committed fraud, said that the proper remedy was a matter of discretion, and concluded that \"weighing all of the circumstances in this case,\" dismissal was the proper sanction \"commensurate with Mr. Hull's conduct\" and to deter future misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, the plaintiffs make three different claims of error: that the fraud finding was not supported by clear and convincing evidence; that dismissal was not an appropriate sanction; and that &#8212; independent of these arguments &#8212; dismissal of Patricia's claims for her own mental anguish and economic expense was not supported by any independent finding of fraud on her part. We reject the first two claims but conclude that a remand is required to determine whether Patricia's claims should be dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first question is whether Andrew engaged in a pattern of deliberate deception in the course of discovery. It is common ground that clear and convincing evidence is required, <i>Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</i> 892 F.2d 1115, 1118 (1st Cir.1989). On the other hand, the district court's findings as to whether Andrew dishonestly withheld information are reviewed only for \"clear error.\" <i>Cavallaro v. United States,</i> 284 F.3d 236, 245 (1st Cir.2002). (The phrase \"abuse of discretion\" is sometimes used, <i>e.g., Aoude,</i> 892 F.2d at 1117-18, but the phrasing makes little difference.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that Andrew failed to disclose the prior injuries when specifically asked for such information during his deposition and that the omissions were material. The harder issue, usually the sticking point in perjury and fraud cases, is Andrew's state of mind which &#8212; absent a confession &#8212; must be inferred from circumstances. Here, several circumstances combine to reinforce the district court's finding of scienter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the information was squarely sought. In his deposition, Andrew was asked directly about his prior medical history and failed to reveal any of the three prior incidents. All three of the prior incidents were serious and sufficiently related to the current claim of injuries, so that it is unlikely that even one would have been forgotten. That all three would have been forgotten through happenstance or distraction strains belief. And, given Andrew's obvious self-interest to enlarge his potential damages, the inference of deliberate deceit is hard to escape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there is a broader pattern of deceit. For example, when the Orlando incident was unearthed by the defense, Andrew gave answers as to his medical treatment omitting the diagnosis of Carpal-Tunnel syndrome; and he withheld such information from his own doctor in this case, reducing the likelihood that it would be discovered. Andrew also appears to have lied when he answered an interrogatory by saying that <i>all</i> of his present claimed injuries were the result of the fall in San Juan, although this might be a closer question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Andrew was not a neophyte. He was the president of a firm named \"Settlement Associates\" which sells insurance and structured settlements to law firms and other companies. His wife was a claims manager for State Farm Insurance Company. Further, his prior injuries had resulted in a range of doctor and hospital visits over a substantial period, and he could not have avoided learning a good deal about the causes and nature of his prior injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no clear error in the district court's finding that Andrew's fraud was proved by clear and convincing evidence. It is easy enough to forget details of one's past; and possibly Andrew did suffer some impairment in the fall affecting his memory. But the information withheld was too patent and too convenient, and the pattern of deceit and grudging concessions too marked, to excuse the misstatements and omissions as merely careless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next question is whether a district court has power to dismiss a complaint because the plaintiff lies substantially and materially in the course of discovery. In our own circuit, fraud &#8212; at least of a kind sometimes called \"fraud on the court\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> &#8212; is a <i>potential</i> basis for dismissing a claim on the facts where</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a party has sentiently set in motion some unconscionable scheme calculated to interfere with the judicial system's ability impartially to adjudicate a matter by improperly influencing the trier or unfairly hampering the presentation of the opposing party's claim or defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Aoude,</i> 892 F.2d at 1118-19. There is similar case law in other circuits. <i>Shepherd v. Am. Broad. Cos.,</i> 62 F.3d 1469, 1476-78 (D.C.Cir.1995); <i>Wyle v. R.J. Reynolds Indus.,</i> 709 F.2d 585, 589 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although not so terrible as attempted bribery of a judge, Andrew's conduct fits within the <i>Aoude</i> category. It was deliberate, broad enough to constitute a scheme, unconscionable, and calculated to enhance damages, thus unfairly hampering the defense. The unfairness was two-fold: the scope of the injuries attributable to Andrew's fall in Puerto Rico was likely to be the main issue in the case, and, in the nature of things, past medical information is peculiarly within the privileged control of the plaintiff. The same conduct might not necessarily be enough to reopen a final judgment after one year, <i>Geo. P. Reintjes Co., Inc. v. Riley Stoker Corp.,</i> 71 F.3d 44, 47-49 (1st Cir.1995), but finality of longstanding judgments is a different matter than dismissal of a current complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That a remedy is in principle available does not mean that its use is reasonable in all circumstances. Here, plaintiffs make both a substantive and a procedural objection. The first is that it was unreasonable to use so extreme a remedy as dismissal, especially where the defense ultimately gained the information and lesser remedies were available. The second is that the district court erred by not specifically considering the pros and cons of alternative lesser remedies. Both are uphill arguments, given the trial judge's special competence in judging the extent of the misbehavior and its effects. <i>Young v. Gordon,</i> 330 F.3d 76, 81 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with substance, the sanction was obviously severe and lesser sanctions were available. For example, the court could have debarred Andrew from presenting certain claims of injury, underscored the jury's ability to draw negative inferences from his deceits, or both. And while the deceits imposed extra expenses on the defense, an award of attorney's fees and costs could have been treated as sufficiently offsetting this damage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, dismissing only the affected claims of injury would have wiped out most of the main damage claims anyway, while inference drawing would be available without a sanction and could be pretty mild in effect if Andrew were nimble on cross-examination. His deceits were substantial, deliberate, and went to the heart of the case. And since not everyone will be caught, the penalty needs to be severe enough to deter. In the choice of remedy, there was no abuse of discretion &#8212; the proper test as to remedy. <i>Aoude,</i> 892 F.2d at 1117; <i>Fernandez v. Leonard,</i> 963 F.2d 459, 462 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for procedure, plaintiffs draw our attention to cases in other circuits saying that the trial judge must expressly consider lesser alternatives before adopting the extreme remedy of dismissal; and they urge us to adopt such a rule. <i>Shepherd,</i> 62 F.3d at 1479; <i>Halaco Eng'g Co. v. Costle,</i> 843 F.2d 376, 381-82 (9th Cir.1988). We agree that lesser remedies ought to be considered, where reasonably available, whenever a judge imposes the harshest sanction. But in our view, how much consideration, and in what form depend upon the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district judge did not grasp thoughtlessly for dismissal. The choice of remedy followed a careful study over many pages of the precise deceits and Andrew's culpability; the court recognized that it had discretion as to remedy; and it said that dismissal was \"commensurate\" with Andrew's conduct and the need to deter \"this type of behavior from recurring\" &#8212; behavior that the court said went well beyond injury to an opposing litigant and threatened \"the integrity of this court.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Requiring a district judge to list and address alternatives may sometimes make sense, for example where the judge has ignored a seemingly superior remedy. Occasionally it may be a polite way to say that the remedy chosen is disproportionate to the offense &#8212; also not the case here. How much explanation is required of the remedy chosen, and how much discounting of alternatives may be warranted, depend on the facts, and to us a mindlessly mechanical rule makes no sense. Here, the district court did enough to assure reasoned consideration of the remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Patricia's claims are a different matter. The subject of claims by one who is secondarily injured is complicated, but Puerto Rico law allows one spouse to recover in some cases at least for emotional distress suffered through the injury of the other spouse, <i>Santini Rivera v. Serv. Air, Inc.,</i> 137 P.R. Dec. 1, 10 (1994). Nor do defendants suggest that such a claim is barred because the directly injured spouse is debarred from recovery by his own misconduct in court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, defendants argue that Patricia joined actively in the fraud. They say that she joined in the complaint asserting that her own damages were due in part to Andrew's Carpal-Tunnel syndrome and back injuries allegedly due to the San Juan accident; that she joined by cross reference her husband's false interrogatory answer (\"All the injuries and treatment I had were as a result of the 11-9-99 incident which is the subject of the complaint\"); and that when the plaintiffs were ordered by the court to disclose all of Andrew's medical history, she joined in the response which failed to disclose the full history of prior accidents and treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants then argue that Patricia must have known of the three prior incidents of greatest importance (1982, 1995, 1996) and, given the filings made on her behalf, is equally responsible for the deceits. They also note that Patricia worked for many years as a claims manager at State Farm Insurance Company and dealt with personal injury claims, so had to understand the importance of the omissions. Quite possibly the district court did believe that she was complicit in the fraud, and the evidence may well support such conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, nowhere does the district court's decision separately muster evidence of Patricia's culpability or make an express finding that she personally engaged in or knowingly abetted the fraud. The single strongest evidence of fraud against Andrew is his deposition answers and we know nothing about what, if anything, Patricia said in any deposition of her own. The proper solution is a remand to allow the district judge to make his own determination and supporting findings as to Patricia's responsibility for the fraud &#8212; assuming that she thinks it advisable to proceed with her claims which are now much weakened by Andrew's lack of credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have asked that any remand that may be necessary should be conducted before a different judge. The ground given is that the district court's findings of fraud are so couched as to \"suggest[] some antipathy to [the] litigant\"; plaintiffs' counsel says that while the \"judge [who presided in the district court] would, no doubt, remain an impartial and professional jurist on remand,\" a new judge approaching the case \"on a fresh page\" would be better. The defendants oppose the request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute providing for remands confers on the circuit courts authority to make such orders \"as may be just under the circumstances,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2106 (2000); and remand orders by the circuit court to a different judge have been held permissible by the Supreme Court, <i>Liteky v. United States,</i> 510 U.S. 540, 554, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). But views formed by a judge in considering a case are normally not a sound basis either for required recusal or for directing that a different judge be assigned on remand. <i>Liteky,</i> 510 U.S. at 555-56, 114 S.Ct. 1147. In this instance, nothing in the district judge's decision warrants the remedy sought by plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of dismissal is <i>affirmed</i> as to the claims of Andrew Hull and the conjugal partnership. As to the individual claims of Patricia Hull, the judgment is <i>vacated</i> and the matter <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The defense relies upon Andrew's negative answers to two interrogatory questions dealing with medical history; but one (strangely) arguably excluded \"personal injury\" and the other related to post-claim accident injuries or illnesses. Yet in response to the latter, Andrew incautiously added that \"all\" his present injuries were due to the San Juan accident</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The \"fraud on the court\" phrase is also sometimes used in drawing distinctions in the quite different context of reopening final judgments &#8212; especially in distinguishing between fraud that must be presented within one year of the judgment and fraud that can be invoked later under the savings clause of Fed.

The basis for the dismissal was the district court's finding of fraud in the conduct of the litigation. Because the finding of fraud as well as the remedy adopted by the district court are contested on appeal, we begin with a bare-bones summary of what happened, reserving some of the details until discussion of the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 8, 1999, Andrew K. Hull of California was visiting San Juan, Puerto Rico, on a business trip. While walking through a city sidewalk site that was under repair, Andrew allegedly caught his foot on a raised piece of wire mesh and fell heavily, hitting his face and left arm. He proceeded to dinner but, still feeling pain in his left elbow, visited a local hospital thereafter where x-rays revealed a fracture of the elbow and lesser injury to the nose. Andrew attended business meetings over the next three days and then returned to California.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After his return, Andrew allegedly experienced a range of symptoms, consulted a number of doctors, and underwent several surgeries. One was to repair a nasal obstruction and deviated septum; others were spinal operations to relieve spinal cord compression and repair an extruded disc and related conditions. Carpal-Tunnel syndrome was diagnosed in both wrists, and surgery as to both to relieve this condition ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andrew also complained of mental and emotional problems, including poor memory, sleeplessness, depression, fatigue, headaches and sexual dysfunction. After testing, a neurologist found that Andrew suffered from post-concussion syndrome. Although Andrew had not lost consciousness at the time of the fall, the neurologist opined that the syndrome could nevertheless have resulted from the fall and the doctor prescribed treatments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Andrew and Patricia, his wife, filed this diversity action in the federal district court in Puerto Rico, against the municipality, the contractor working on the sidewalk, and the contractor's insurer. The complaint, charging negligence, attributed to the accident the physical and mental impairments already described as well as a few other symptoms (e.g., rotator cuff injury, aphasia) and loss of income. On his own behalf, Andrew sought $2 million in damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Patricia claimed separately for loss of income (due to the need to care for Andrew) and mental anguish. Her claim was for $300,000. An additional $561,000 was sought by the \"conjugal partnership,\" a community property concept recognized under the law of Puerto Rico, <i>e.g., Fernandez-Cerra v. Commercial Ins. Co. of Newark,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2303413\"><a href=\"/opinion/2303413/fernandez-cerra-v-commercial-insurance-co-of-newark/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 316 (D.P.R.1972); but no separate argument has been offered on appeal as to its claim, and we therefore disregard it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Extensive discovery was conducted by the defendants over many months. Andrew did not reveal, in response to questions fairly seeking this information, facts about his prior injuries and treatment &#8212; until the defense uncovered this information on its own. These included a rear-end automobile collision in 1982 in which Andrew suffered back injuries; a neck injury in 1995 leading to a diagnosis of nerve injury (neuropathy); and a 1996 slip and fall incident in an Orlando, Florida, hotel, resulting among other things in a diagnosis of Carpal-Tunnel syndrome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The information was patently material. Various symptoms and conditions associated with Andrew's earlier injuries overlapped with those that he claimed had resulted from the more recent fall in Puerto Rico. This is obvious with respect to the Carpal-Tunnel syndrome but, in addition, the rear-end collision in 1982 was a possible source of some of the spinal damage, and nerve injury and sleep problems had been claimed as a result of one or both of the other two earlier accidents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When taxed about these omissions, Andrew's position was that in the heat of his deposition he had not remembered any of these incidents or claims. As to their absence from interrogatory answers, Andrew said that defendants had not asked the right questions. The defendants moved for dismissal of the case on the ground that the litigation was being perpetrated through fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2002, the district court granted the motion and dismissed the case in a 23-page opinion and order, analyzing in detail Andrew's answers to interrogatories, deposition questions and in affidavit statements. The district judge concluded \"by clear and convincing evidence\" that Andrew had committed fraud, said that the proper remedy was a matter of discretion, and concluded that \"weighing all of the circumstances in this case,\" dismissal was the proper sanction \"commensurate with Mr. Hull's conduct\" and to deter future misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, the plaintiffs make three different claims of error: that the fraud finding was not supported by clear and convincing evidence; that dismissal was not an appropriate sanction; and that &#8212; independent of these arguments &#8212; dismissal of Patricia's claims for her own mental anguish and economic expense was not supported by any independent finding of fraud on her part. We reject the first two claims but conclude that a remand is required to determine whether Patricia's claims should be dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first question is whether Andrew engaged in a pattern of deliberate deception in the course of discovery. It is common ground that clear and convincing evidence is required, <i>Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534524\"><a href=\"/opinion/534524/salim-aoude-v-mobil-oil-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1115</span></a></span>, 1118 (1st Cir.1989). On the other hand, the district court's findings as to whether Andrew dishonestly withheld information are reviewed only for \"clear error.\" <i>Cavallaro v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199903\"><a href=\"/opinion/199903/carvallaro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 245 (1st Cir.2002). (The phrase \"abuse of discretion\" is sometimes used, <i>e.g., Aoude,</i> 892 F.2d at 1117-18, but the phrasing makes little difference.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that Andrew failed to disclose the prior injuries when specifically asked for such information during his deposition and that the omissions were material. The harder issue, usually the sticking point in perjury and fraud cases, is Andrew's state of mind which &#8212; absent a confession &#8212; must be inferred from circumstances. Here, several circumstances combine to reinforce the district court's finding of scienter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the information was squarely sought. In his deposition, Andrew was asked directly about his prior medical history and failed to reveal any of the three prior incidents. All three of the prior incidents were serious and sufficiently related to the current claim of injuries, so that it is unlikely that even one would have been forgotten. That all three would have been forgotten through happenstance or distraction strains belief. And, given Andrew's obvious self-interest to enlarge his potential damages, the inference of deliberate deceit is hard to escape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there is a broader pattern of deceit. For example, when the Orlando incident was unearthed by the defense, Andrew gave answers as to his medical treatment omitting the diagnosis of Carpal-Tunnel syndrome; and he withheld such information from his own doctor in this case, reducing the likelihood that it would be discovered. Andrew also appears to have lied when he answered an interrogatory by saying that <i>all</i> of his present claimed injuries were the result of the fall in San Juan, although this might be a closer question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Andrew was not a neophyte. He was the president of a firm named \"Settlement Associates\" which sells insurance and structured settlements to law firms and other companies. His wife was a claims manager for State Farm Insurance Company. Further, his prior injuries had resulted in a range of doctor and hospital visits over a substantial period, and he could not have avoided learning a good deal about the causes and nature of his prior injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no clear error in the district court's finding that Andrew's fraud was proved by clear and convincing evidence. It is easy enough to forget details of one's past; and possibly Andrew did suffer some impairment in the fall affecting his memory. But the information withheld was too patent and too convenient, and the pattern of deceit and grudging concessions too marked, to excuse the misstatements and omissions as merely careless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next question is whether a district court has power to dismiss a complaint because the plaintiff lies substantially and materially in the course of discovery. In our own circuit, fraud &#8212; at least of a kind sometimes called \"fraud on the court\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> &#8212; is a <i>potential</i> basis for dismissing a claim on the facts where</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a party has sentiently set in motion some unconscionable scheme calculated to interfere with the judicial system's ability impartially to adjudicate a matter by improperly influencing the trier or unfairly hampering the presentation of the opposing party's claim or defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Aoude,</i> 892 F.2d at 1118-19. There is similar case law in other circuits. <i>Shepherd v. Am. Broad. Cos.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702289\"><a href=\"/opinion/702289/michele-e-shepherd-and-larue-graves-v-american-broadcasting-companies/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1469</span></a></span>, 1476-78 (D.C.Cir.1995); <i>Wyle v. R.J. Reynolds Indus.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"419817\"><a href=\"/opinion/419817/frederick-s-wyle-professional-corp-trustee-in-bankruptcy-for-pacific/\"><span class=\"volume\">709</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></a></span>, 589 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although not so terrible as attempted bribery of a judge, Andrew's conduct fits within the <i>Aoude</i> category. It was deliberate, broad enough to constitute a scheme, unconscionable, and calculated to enhance damages, thus unfairly hampering the defense. The unfairness was two-fold: the scope of the injuries attributable to Andrew's fall in Puerto Rico was likely to be the main issue in the case, and, in the nature of things, past medical information is peculiarly within the privileged control of the plaintiff. The same conduct might not necessarily be enough to reopen a final judgment after one year, <i>Geo. P. Reintjes Co., Inc. v. Riley Stoker Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196462\"><a href=\"/opinion/196462/reintjes-company-v-riley-stoker/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 47-49 (1st Cir.1995), but finality of longstanding judgments is a different matter than dismissal of a current complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That a remedy is in principle available does not mean that its use is reasonable in all circumstances. Here, plaintiffs make both a substantive and a procedural objection. The first is that it was unreasonable to use so extreme a remedy as dismissal, especially where the defense ultimately gained the information and lesser remedies were available. The second is that the district court erred by not specifically considering the pros and cons of alternative lesser remedies. Both are uphill arguments, given the trial judge's special competence in judging the extent of the misbehavior and its effects. <i>Young v. Gordon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200491\"><a href=\"/opinion/200491/young-v-gordon/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 81 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with substance, the sanction was obviously severe and lesser sanctions were available. For example, the court could have debarred Andrew from presenting certain claims of injury, underscored the jury's ability to draw negative inferences from his deceits, or both. And while the deceits imposed extra expenses on the defense, an award of attorney's fees and costs could have been treated as sufficiently offsetting this damage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, dismissing only the affected claims of injury would have wiped out most of the main damage claims anyway, while inference drawing would be available without a sanction and could be pretty mild in effect if Andrew were nimble on cross-examination. His deceits were substantial, deliberate, and went to the heart of the case. And since not everyone will be caught, the penalty needs to be severe enough to deter. In the choice of remedy, there was no abuse of discretion &#8212; the proper test as to remedy. <i>Aoude,</i> 892 F.2d at 1117; <i>Fernandez v. Leonard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583332\"><a href=\"/opinion/583332/oscar-j-fernandez-v-francis-t-leonard/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span>, 462 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for procedure, plaintiffs draw our attention to cases in other circuits saying that the trial judge must expressly consider lesser alternatives before adopting the extreme remedy of dismissal; and they urge us to adopt such a rule. <i>Shepherd,</i> 62 F.3d at 1479; <i>Halaco Eng'g Co. v. Costle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503844\"><a href=\"/opinion/503844/halaco-engineering-co-a-california-corporation-v-douglas-m-costle/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></a></span>, 381-82 (9th Cir.1988). We agree that lesser remedies ought to be considered, where reasonably available, whenever a judge imposes the harshest sanction. But in our view, how much consideration, and in what form depend upon the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district judge did not grasp thoughtlessly for dismissal. The choice of remedy followed a careful study over many pages of the precise deceits and Andrew's culpability; the court recognized that it had discretion as to remedy; and it said that dismissal was \"commensurate\" with Andrew's conduct and the need to deter \"this type of behavior from recurring\" &#8212; behavior that the court said went well beyond injury to an opposing litigant and threatened \"the integrity of this court.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Requiring a district judge to list and address alternatives may sometimes make sense, for example where the judge has ignored a seemingly superior remedy. Occasionally it may be a polite way to say that the remedy chosen is disproportionate to the offense &#8212; also not the case here. How much explanation is required of the remedy chosen, and how much discounting of alternatives may be warranted, depend on the facts, and to us a mindlessly mechanical rule makes no sense. Here, the district court did enough to assure reasoned consideration of the remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Patricia's claims are a different matter. The subject of claims by one who is secondarily injured is complicated, but Puerto Rico law allows one spouse to recover in some cases at least for emotional distress suffered through the injury of the other spouse, <i>Santini Rivera v. Serv. Air, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 10 (1994). Nor do defendants suggest that such a claim is barred because the directly injured spouse is debarred from recovery by his own misconduct in court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, defendants argue that Patricia joined actively in the fraud. They say that she joined in the complaint asserting that her own damages were due in part to Andrew's Carpal-Tunnel syndrome and back injuries allegedly due to the San Juan accident; that she joined by cross reference her husband's false interrogatory answer (\"All the injuries and treatment I had were as a result of the 11-9-99 incident which is the subject of the complaint\"); and that when the plaintiffs were ordered by the court to disclose all of Andrew's medical history, she joined in the response which failed to disclose the full history of prior accidents and treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants then argue that Patricia must have known of the three prior incidents of greatest importance (1982, 1995, 1996) and, given the filings made on her behalf, is equally responsible for the deceits. They also note that Patricia worked for many years as a claims manager at State Farm Insurance Company and dealt with personal injury claims, so had to understand the importance of the omissions. Quite possibly the district court did believe that she was complicit in the fraud, and the evidence may well support such conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, nowhere does the district court's decision separately muster evidence of Patricia's culpability or make an express finding that she personally engaged in or knowingly abetted the fraud. The single strongest evidence of fraud against Andrew is his deposition answers and we know nothing about what, if anything, Patricia said in any deposition of her own. The proper solution is a remand to allow the district judge to make his own determination and supporting findings as to Patricia's responsibility for the fraud &#8212; assuming that she thinks it advisable to proceed with her claims which are now much weakened by Andrew's lack of credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have asked that any remand that may be necessary should be conducted before a different judge. The ground given is that the district court's findings of fraud are so couched as to \"suggest[] some antipathy to [the] litigant\"; plaintiffs' counsel says that while the \"judge [who presided in the district court] would, no doubt, remain an impartial and professional jurist on remand,\" a new judge approaching the case \"on a fresh page\" would be better. The defendants oppose the request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute providing for remands confers on the circuit courts authority to make such orders \"as may be just under the circumstances,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2106 (2000); and remand orders by the circuit court to a different judge have been held permissible by the Supreme Court, <i>Liteky v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112935\"><a href=\"/opinion/112935/liteky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span>, 554, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112935\"><a href=\"/opinion/112935/liteky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span> (1994). But views formed by a judge in considering a case are normally not a sound basis either for required recusal or for directing that a different judge be assigned on remand. <i>Liteky,</i> 510 U.S. at 555-56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112935\"><a href=\"/opinion/112935/liteky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As to the individual claims of Patricia Hull, the judgment is <i>vacated</i> and the matter <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The defense relies upon Andrew's negative answers to two interrogatory questions dealing with medical history; but one (strangely) arguably excluded \"personal injury\" and the other related to post-claim accident injuries or illnesses.
