D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                   Torruella, Lynch, and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Stuart W. Tisdale, Jr., with whom Tisdale & Davis, P.A. was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     F. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Paul D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 14, 2006\n\f          Per Curiam.    Andres Peralta pleaded guilty to conspiring\n\nto possess cocaine hydrochloride with intent to distribute, 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B), 846, and was sentenced to 135\n\nmonths in prison.   He seeks a new sentencing hearing.\n\n          Peralta's flagship argument, and the only argument that\n\nwarrants an extensive response, is that the district court erred in\n\nfinding him a career offender under the applicable 1995 version of\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(a) (\"A defendant is a career offender if (1) the\n\ndefendant was at least eighteen years old at the time of the\n\ninstant offense, (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony\n\nthat is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance\n\noffense, and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony\n\nconvictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance\n\noffense.\").   Peralta says that he should not have been regarded as\n\na career offender because one of the two \"prior felony convictions\"\n\non which this finding was premised -- a 1988 New York \"youthful\n\noffender adjudication,\" see N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law § 720.10, for the\n\nattempted sale of a controlled substance in the third degree --\n\nshould not have been counted under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1.       Pointing out\n\nthat the term \"conviction\" in U.S.S.G. §4B1.1 is functionally\n\ndefined in U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a) as involving an \"adjudication of\n\nguilt\"   obtained   by   \"guilty   plea,   trial,   or   plea   of   nolo\n\ncontendere,\" Peralta says that the government failed to establish\n\nthat his 1988 \"youthful offender adjudication\" was so obtained.\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f            Peralta relies on United States v. DiPina, 178 F.3d 68\n\n(1st Cir. 1999), in making this argument. In DiPina, we considered\n\nwhether, under the same provisions of U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a), certain\n\njuvenile    dispositions   wherein   the   defendant   \"admit[ted]   to\n\nsufficient facts\" in Rhode Island Family Court should be counted in\n\nhis criminal history score.    See id. at 70-71.   Because the record\n\ndid not divulge whether defendant's admissions were obtained by\n\nmeans of procedures we confidently could regard as functionally\n\nequivalent to a guilty or a nolo plea -- which at minimum require\n\nthe defendant formally to admit (or to fail to contest) the\n\ncommission of acts that a judge finds to constitute a crime -- we\n\nremanded for further record development.       See id. at 72-78.     In\n\ndoing so, we emphasized that because the government was arguing in\n\nfavor of counting the defendant's juvenile dispositions in the\n\ncriminal history calculation, it bore the burden of \"show[ing] that\n\nwhat happened in the prior proceeding was in substance a plea of\n\nguilty or nolo.\"   Id. at 75 (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            Invoking the rationale of DiPina, Peralta says that his\n\n1988 \"youthful offender adjudication\" should not have been counted\n\nbecause the record does not reveal whether the procedures by which\n\nit was procured involved, in substance, a plea of guilty or nolo,\n\nand thus an \"adjudication of guilt.\"       Peralta's argument is very\n\nably advanced, but we reject it because it was not presented to the\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fsentencing judge and because the counting of the adjudication does\n\nnot constitute \"plain error\" within the meaning of Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n52(b).\n\n          To notice the alleged error under Rule 52(b), we would\n\nhave to conclude, inter alia, that the sentencing judge clearly or\n\nobviously should not have counted the 1988 youthful offender\n\nadjudication in determining whether Peralta was a career offender\n\nunder the guidelines.    See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725,\n\n734 (1993).   There is no basis for such a conclusion.   Although the\n\nrecord contains no evidence as to how Peralta's 1988 youthful\n\noffender adjudication was obtained, or of how New York youthful\n\noffender adjudications typically take place, we may take notice of\n\nthe fact that an adult \"conviction\" is a necessary prerequisite to\n\na youthful offender adjudication.      See N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law §\n\n720.20(1)(a); see also United States v. Jones, 415 F.3d 256, 264\n\n(2d Cir. 2005); United States v. Driskell, 277 F.3d 150, 152-55 (2d\n\nCir. 2002); Capital Newspapers v. Moynihan, 71 N.Y.2d 263, 268\n\n(1988).   And there is no reason to suppose that the prerequisite\n\nadult \"conviction\" under New York law involves, in the case of a\n\nplea, procedures that fall short of the \"adjudication of guilt\"\n\ndescribed in DiPina.      See Driskell, 277 F.3d at 152 (youths\n\neligible for youthful offender adjudications are first tried \"'as\n\nany criminal defendant would be'\") (quoting Capital Newspapers, 71\n\nN.Y.2d at 152)).\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f           Although Peralta did not cite DiPina below or make the\n\nspecific argument just summarized prior to or at his sentencing\n\nhearing, he says that other objections to the counting of the 1988\n\nyouthful offender adjudication made in his sentencing memorandum,\n\nand at the sentencing hearing, sufficed to put the matter in issue.\n\nPeralta says that he has merely, and allowably, \"refined\" his\n\nposition on appeal by providing an additional reason why the\n\nconviction should not be counted.          Cf. DiPina, 178 F.3d at 72 n.7\n\n(stating that defendant was entitled to present the appellate court\n\nwith additional reasons why his admissions to sufficient facts in\n\nRhode   Island   Family    Court   were     not   \"the   same   thing\"   as   a\n\n\"conviction\" under the sentencing guidelines).\n\n           Peralta's appellate argument is not a refinement. It is,\n\nrather, an entirely different position than the ones taken prior to\n\nand at the sentencing hearing, which, to the extent that they were\n\ndeveloped at all, involved assertions that (1) the sentencing judge\n\nshould not feel himself bound by Second Circuit cases addressing\n\nother arguments why New York youthful offender adjudications should\n\nnot be counted, and (2) the 1988 adjudication should not be counted\n\nbecause it led only to a sentence of probation.                   Obviously,\n\npermitting a party to present an additional legal argument in favor\n\nof a position taken below invites far fewer inefficiencies than\n\ndoes permitting a party to take a different position entirely,\n\nespecially   where,   as     here,    the    new    position    contemplates\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fevidentiary submissions and factfinding that were not demanded in\n\nthe lower court.        The issue was not preserved.\n\n           In     his    counseled   briefs,1         Peralta   presents    three\n\nadditional arguments.       First, he contends that the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Shepard v. United States, 125 S. Ct. 1254 (2005),\n\nlimits the universe of evidence that the sentencing court was\n\nentitled to consider in determining whether his 1988 youthful\n\noffender   adjudication      involved      an   \"adjudication     of    guilt\"   to\n\n\"judicial evidence\" of a type utterly lacking in this case.                      We\n\nleave this issue to another day because, as explained above,\n\nPeralta has forfeited his appellate argument challenging the 1988\n\nyouthful offender adjudication, and because there was no plain\n\nerror in counting the 1988 adjudication, even in the absence of any\n\nevidence as to how it was procured.\n\n           Second, Peralta argues that, under the logic of Shepard,\n\nUnited   States    v.    Booker,   125    S.    Ct.   738   (2005),    Blakely   v.\n\nWashington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), and Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530\n\n\n\n     1\n      Peralta also has submitted a pro se brief which, in large\nmeasure, presents fact-specific arguments that trial counsel\nrendered constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel. As is\nour custom, we shall let the district court have the first crack at\nthese arguments, should Peralta wish to renew them in a motion\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2255.     See, e.g., United States v. Mercedes\nMercedes, 428 F.3d 355, 361 (2005).\n     Peralta's pro se brief also hints at arguments for vacatur\nwhich go beyond his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\nWe have considered these additional arguments and conclude that\nthey provide no basis for upsetting Peralta's conviction and\nsentence.\n\n                                         -6-\n\fU.S. 466 (2000), the fact of his prior convictions should have been\n\nproved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.                   But Almendarez-\n\nTorres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224 (1998), holds otherwise, and\n\nwe have stated that we shall follow Almendarez-Torres until the\n\nSupreme Court disavows it, see United States v. Jiminez-Beltre, 440\n\nF.3d 514, 518-19 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).\n\n           Third, Peralta asserts that his sentence was unreasonable\n\nbecause it was unreasonably greater than necessary to promote\n\nrespect   for    the   law,   see    18    U.S.C.   §   3553(a),    because   the\n\nsentencing judge erroneously sought to do comparative justice\n\nbetween Peralta and a less culpable co-conspirator who received a\n\n108-month sentence (which the judge failed to appreciate was handed\n\ndown prior to Booker), and because the judge erroneously treated\n\nthe   advisory     guidelines       sentencing      range   as     presumptively\n\nreasonable.     But we have reviewed the transcript of the sentencing\n\nproceedings with care and are of the opinion that the judge\n\nsentenced Peralta to a reasonable prison term, that no legal error\n\nunderlay the court's reference to the co-conspirator's sentence,\n\nand that the court employed a mode of analysis which was entirely\n\nconsistent with that later prescribed by the en banc court in\n\nJimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 514.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f",

Ct.   738   (2005),    Blakely   v.\n\nWashington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004), and Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530\n\n\n\n     1\n      Peralta also has submitted a pro se brief which, in large\nmeasure, presents fact-specific arguments that trial counsel\nrendered constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel. As is\nour custom, we shall let the district court have the first crack at\nthese arguments, should Peralta wish to renew them in a motion\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2255.     See, e.g., United States v. Mercedes\nMercedes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792364\"><a href=\"/opinion/792364/united-states-v-domingo-mercedes-mercedes/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 361 (2005).\n     Peralta's pro se brief also hints at arguments for vacatur\nwhich go beyond his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\nWe have considered these additional arguments and conclude that\nthey provide no basis for upsetting Peralta's conviction and\nsentence.\n\n                                         -6-\n\fU.S. 466 (2000), the fact of his prior convictions should have been\n\nproved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.                   But Almendarez-\n\nTorres v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998), holds otherwise, and\n\nwe have stated that we shall follow Almendarez-Torres until the\n\nSupreme Court disavows it, see United States v. Jiminez-Beltre, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 518-19 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).\n\n           Third, Peralta asserts that his sentence was unreasonable\n\nbecause it was unreasonably greater than necessary to promote\n\nrespect   for    the   law,   see    18    U.S.C.   §   3553(a),    because   the\n\nsentencing judge erroneously sought to do comparative justice\n\nbetween Peralta and a less culpable co-conspirator who received a\n\n108-month sentence (which the judge failed to appreciate was handed\n\ndown prior to Booker), and because the judge erroneously treated\n\nthe   advisory     guidelines       sentencing      range   as     presumptively\n\nreasonable.     But we have reviewed the transcript of the sentencing\n\nproceedings with care and are of the opinion that the judge\n\nsentenced Peralta to a reasonable prison term, that no legal error\n\nunderlay the court's reference to the co-conspirator's sentence,\n\nand that the court employed a mode of analysis which was entirely\n\nconsistent with that later prescribed by the en banc court in\n\nJimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 514.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f</pre>",
