Plaintiffs-Appellants Therese\n\nShepley   and   Larry   Young,    representing    a   class   of   nationwide\n\nconsumers, appeal from the district court's adverse entry of a\n\nfinal judgment as to their claims against Defendants-Appellees\n\nJohnson & Johnson; Centocor, Inc.; and Ortho Biotech Products, L.P.\n\n(collectively \"J&J\").         The appellants contend that the district\n\ncourt improperly entered judgment against them before trial.               For\n\nthe reasons that follow, we remand this matter to the district\n\ncourt.\n\n\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           This appeal represents just one case in a sprawling,\n\nnationwide multi-district class action involving the pricing of\n\nphysician-administered pharmaceutical drugs which were reimbursed\n\nby Medicare, private insurers and patients making co-insurance\n\npayments from 1991 through 2003.           The gravamen of the nationwide\n\nlitigation   against    the    pharmaceutical    companies    is   that   they\n\nunfairly and deceptively inflated the drugs' \"average wholesale\n\nprices\" (\"AWPs\"), a price published by the pharmaceutical companies\n\nin various private industry publications and widely used as a\n\nbenchmark for reimbursement payments, while simultaneously offering\n\nsecret discounts and rebates to physicians.            The result of this\n\nscheme was that the AWPs dramatically diverged from the physicians'\n\nactual acquisition costs, a divergence referred to as the \"spread,\"\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthereby creating a windfall profit for the physicians who bought\n\nthe drugs at the lower prices but were reimbursed based on the\n\nhigher      prices.        The   plaintiffs        further    allege     that     the\n\npharmaceutical companies exploited this system by \"marketing the\n\nspread,\" by which a company used the prospect of windfall profits\n\nto induce physicians to prescribe its drug, thereby protecting or\n\nincreasing market share vis-a-vis competitor drugs.                      This case\n\ninvolves just a slice of the larger litigation: the claims against\n\nJ&J   by     Class    1   plaintiffs    --   the   group     of   natural    persons\n\nnationwide who made co-payments based on AWP for relevant Medicare\n\nPart B drugs.1        For a detailed discussion of this scheme, and of\n\nthe   district        court's    case    management     efforts,       see   In   re\n\n\n\n      1\n          \"Class 1: Medicare Part B Co-Payment Class\" is defined as:\n\n                   All natural persons nationwide who made,\n              or who incurred an obligation enforceable at\n              the time of judgment to make, a co-payment\n              based on AWP for a Medicare Part B covered\n              Subject Drug that was manufactured by . . .\n              the Johnson & Johnson Group (Johnson &\n              Johnson,   Centocor,   Inc.,  Ortho   Biotech,\n              McNeil-PPC, Inc., and Janssen Pharmaceutica\n              Products, L.P.). Excluded from the Class are\n              those who made flat co-payments, who were\n              reimbursed fully for any co-payments, or who\n              have the right to be fully reimbursed; and the\n              residents of the states of Alabama, Alaska,\n              Georgia,     Iowa,    Kentucky,     Louisiana,\n              Mississippi, Montana, and Virginia (where\n              consumer protection statutes do not permit\n              class actions).\n\nIn re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig., 233 F.R.D. 229,\n230 (D. Mass. 2006) (footnote omitted).\n\n                                         -4-\n\fPharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale Price Litigation, No. 08-\n\n1056, ___ F.3d ___, slip op. (1st Cir. Sept. 2009), and In re\n\nPharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale Price Litigation, 491 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 20 (D. Mass. 2007). This opinion assumes familiarity with\n\nthose two decisions.\n\n            As part of the broader litigation, the district court\n\nheld a twenty-day bench trial adjudicating the claims of the Class\n\n2 and Class 3 plaintiffs, see In re Pharm. Industry Average\n\nWholesale   Price      Litig.,       233    F.R.D.     229,    231    (D.   Mass.     2006)\n\n(defining   Classes        2   and   3),    against     a     set    of   pharmaceutical\n\ncompanies, including J&J.            See In re Pharm., 491 F. Supp. 2d at 31\n\n(\"This bench trial involved two Massachusetts classes.                         One class,\n\nClass 2, consists of third-party payors ('TPPs') in Massachusetts\n\nthat reimburse Medicare beneficiaries for their statutory twenty\n\npercent coinsurance obligations under Medicare, known as Medigap\n\ninsurance     or     supplemental          insurance.         The      other      class   of\n\nplaintiffs,        Class   3,    consists         of   all     third      party     payors,\n\nend-payors, consumers who make coinsurance payments, and consumers\n\nwho have no insurance for these drugs in Massachusetts and who pay\n\nfor drugs based on AWP.\" (footnotes omitted)).                       In June 2007, the\n\ndistrict court entered a split judgment, finding in favor of the\n\nClass 2 and 3 plaintiffs as to some of the defendants but not\n\nothers.   Id. at 31-32 (summarizing findings).\n\n\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\f          J&J was one of the victorious defendants.   Although the\n\ndistrict court noted that the company's conduct was \"at times\n\ntroubling,\" it ultimately found that J&J's conduct had not damaged\n\nthe class because the spread for the two relevant J&J-manufactured\n\ndrugs, Procrit (epoetin alfa) and Remicade (infliximab), had not\n\nsubstantially exceeded industry expectations about the size of the\n\nspread, and therefore J&J's conduct did not rise to the level of\n\negregiousness necessary to trigger liability under Massachusetts\n\nGeneral Laws Chapter 93A (\"Chapter 93A\").   Id. at 31, 103-04.    In\n\nreaching this conclusion, the district court rejected the Class 2\n\nplaintiffs' contention that any spread at all should trigger\n\npotential liability for the defendants (an approach that the court\n\nlabeled the \"per se\" liability theory), and instead applied a 30%\n\n\"speed limit\" or \"yardstick\" for potential liability, whereby only\n\nspreads that exceeded 30% would trigger potential liability.     The\n\n30% potential liability trigger was also applied to the claims of\n\nthe Class 3 plaintiffs.     Because the spreads for Procrit and\n\nRemicade were approximately 30% or less during the class period,\n\nthe district court declined to find liability as to either Class 2\n\nor Class 3.\n\n          On the strength of those findings, during a July 2007\n\nconference relating to the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims against the\n\nBristol Myers Squibb Company (which ultimately settled before\n\ntrial), the district court characterized its post-trial findings as\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fhaving cut off the claims of the Class 1 plaintiffs against J&J.\n\nSpecifically, the following exchange occurred between the district\n\ncourt and Steve Berman, the attorney representing the Class 1\n\nplaintiffs:\n\n                 THE COURT: . . . So, there will be no\n          more trials with respect to the first five\n          defendants in Track 1 with respect to, as I\n          understand it, Class 1. . . .\n\n                 . . . .\n\n                 MR. BERMAN:   Thereâ€™s one issue on Track\n          1, your Honor.\n\n                 THE COURT:    Yeah?\n\n                 MR. BERMAN:    And, that is Johnson &\n          Johnson.   I know that you said that their\n          drugs didnâ€™t exceed the 30 percent rule for\n          the purposes of Class 2 and 3. But, itâ€™s our\n          position -- and we would like the opportunity\n          to present this or maybe youâ€™ve already\n          decided -- that the 30 percent would not apply\n          to [Class] 1.\n\n                 THE COURT:   I thought I ruled that.\n          The 30 percent did apply to Track -- to Class\n          1.\n\n                 MR. BERMAN: Well, you have a footnote\n          that talks about -- implies that, but you did\n          not rule in that way.    Thatâ€™s your ruling,\n          that we have no J & J Class 1 trial.\n\n                 THE COURT:  I thought it was      not a\n          footnote. I thought I went on and on      about\n          it.    I think I went on and on          about\n          everything. So, maybe I ought to look    at it\n          again.\n\n                 MR. BERMAN:    I donâ€™t think you did --\n\n                 THE COURT:    I think I said that I\n          rejected plaintiffsâ€™ position that the per se\n\n                                 -7-\n\fliability for Class 1 and that I thought that\nthe 30 percent speed limit should apply to\nClass 1 as well.     And, that would be, I\nthought applicable to all of the defendants.\n       So why is that not clear?\n\n       MR. BERMAN: Well, I didnâ€™t see that in\nyour order, your Honor.\n\n        THE COURT:    Theyâ€™ve got it.\n\n       MR. BERMAN: At the time we negotiated\nthe -- via that [BMS] settlement, both sides\nthought that was a risk that could go either\nway.    And, we discussed that with the\nmediator. The mediator didnâ€™t think that it\nwas clear either.\n\n        THE COURT:    Well --\n\n        MR. BERMAN:    Itâ€™s clear now.\n\n       THE COURT:    Itâ€™s clear now.   And, I\nwill look at it again. If it wasnâ€™t clear, it\nis clear. The 30 percent speed limit applies\nto Class 1.\n       I rejected a per se position. And, I\nhave to go look through it again, because I\nthought it was clear.          Thatâ€™s why I\nessentially had the expert go back and\ncalculate the damages again. Because, the way\nhe did it was he aggregated all the years when\nhe did it with the 30 percent speed limit. He\ndidnâ€™t back out the -- it might have been\nstatute of limitations and on the specific\n[drugs].     Thatâ€™s why I needed a root\ncalculation.\n       Otherwise, I could have done it.\nRight?   On the per se.    Because, he did it\nyear by year.\n\n        MR. BERMAN:    Correct, you could have,\nyeah.\n\n       THE COURT:     I could have done that.   I\nmean . . .\n\n\n\n                        -8-\n\f                 MR. BERMAN:   But, we felt it was a\n          different issue with the consumers, because\n          thereâ€™s no evidence that they had any\n          knowledge of the so-called industry norm of\n          20, 25 percent.\n\n                 THE COURT:    Well, I ruled to the\n          contrary and I donâ€™t accept that position.\n          And, I thought it was clear.   If not, Iâ€™m\n          making it clear now.\n\n          Seizing on this colloquy, J&J began asking the district\n\ncourt to officially seal the fate of the Class 1 plaintiffs'\n\nclaims: in August 2007, J&J moved for final judgment under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 54(b) (allowing the district court to enter final judgment\n\nas to \"one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties\" in a\n\nmulti-party or multi-claim lawsuit); the next month, J&J submitted\n\na proposed order concluding that \"no reasonable jury could find\n\nthat the J&J Defendants' conduct violated the consumer protection\n\nlaws applicable to the Class 1 claims\"; and in November 2007, J&J\n\nagain moved the district court for final judgment, asking it to\n\neffect its \"stated intention to enter judgment in favor of the J&J\n\nDefendants    with   respect   to   Class     1\"    and    proposing     the    same\n\nconclusion    that   \"no   reasonable   jury       could   find   that    the    J&J\n\nDefendants'    conduct     violated     the    consumer       protection        laws\n\napplicable to the Class 1 claims.\"\n\n          The Class 1 plaintiffs' responses to these efforts appear\n\nto have taken two different positions.             In one response, filed by\n\nAttorney Donald Haviland, Jr. on behalf of the \"Class 1 and Class\n\n3 Consumers,\" the Class 1 plaintiffs argued that the entry of\n\n                                      -9-\n\fjudgment against them would \"unfairly and inappropriately limit\"\n\ntheir right \"to adjudicate their claims fully.\"         A separate, later\n\nfiling   by   the   other   attorneys    representing   the   plaintiffs,\n\nincluding Mr. Berman, stated that the \"[p]laintiffs . . . neither\n\nconsent to, nor oppose\" the requested relief, but nonetheless\n\nargued, inter alia, that the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims had never\n\nbeen adjudicated, and noted that the district court had not made\n\nthe finding proposed by the Track 1 defendants.2        The latter filing\n\ntherefore requested that the Track 1 defendants' proposed finding\n\nbe omitted from the district court's order.3\n\n           The district court ultimately entered a final judgment\n\npursuant to Rule 54(b) stating that \"the Class 2 and 3 claims\n\nagainst . . . the J&J Defendants . . . proceeded to a bench trial\n\nbefore the Court in November of 2006,\" and that \"[t]he Court . . .\n\ndismissed the claims against the J&J Defendants.\"              The order\n\ncontinued:\n\n           As to the J&J Defendants, the Court ruled,\n           among other things, that although J&Jâ€™s\n           conduct was troubling, it did not violate\n\n\n     2\n      The \"Track 1\" defendants, including J&J, were the first\ndefendants in the multi-district litigation to proceed to trial.\nSee In re Pharm. Industry Average Wholesale Price Litig., 230\nF.R.D. 61, 65 n.1 (D. Mass. 2005).\n     3\n      At oral argument before us, counsel for J&J noted that\nallowing a single class to take two conflicting positions, as the\nClass 1 plaintiffs arguably have here, has the potential to create\nunusual, even novel, difficulties. J&J did not press this point at\nargument or in its brief, however, and therefore we need not\nexplore it here.\n\n                                  -10-\n\f           Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, in part because the\n           spreads on the J&J Defendantsâ€™ subject drugs\n           (ProcritÂ® and RemicadeÂ®) never substantially\n           exceeded the range of spreads generally\n           expected by the industry and government. [In\n           re Pharm.,] 491 F. Supp. 2d at 104.     As a\n           result, the Court ruled that the claims of\n           Class 2 and Class 3 should be dismissed. Id.\n           at 109. The claims by members of Class 1 are\n           dismissed for the same reason.\n\nThe order did not include the Track 1 defendants' proposed finding\n\nthat \"no reasonable jury could find that the J&J Defendants'\n\nconduct violated the consumer protection laws applicable to the\n\nClass 1 claims.\"\n\n           The Class 1 plaintiffs, which include neither industry\n\nnor government, appeal.\n\n\n\nII.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n           We begin by noting that the district court's use of the\n\nword \"dismissed\" in its November 2007 order entering judgment, and\n\nthe fact that it made its findings as to Class 1 after the bench\n\ntrial involving the Class 2 and 3 plaintiffs, admits of some doubt\n\nas to the precise procedural grounding of the judgment.    At oral\n\nargument, counsel for J&J represented, without objection, that the\n\ndistrict court's judgment was entered in accordance with Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 56.   The district court, however, made no\n\nexplicit reference to that Rule, or to summary judgment in general.\n\nAlthough we consider here the consequences of this having been a\n\nsummary judgment, ultimately we believe the wisest course is to\n\n                               -11-\n\fremand to the district court for further explanation of its ruling\n\nand, if necessary, additional proceedings.4\n\n               We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing\n\nall    reasonable       inferences   in    favor    of   the   non-moving    party.\n\nSullivan v. City of Springfield, 561 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n\"Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as\n\nto any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.\"           Id. (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); New Fed\n\nMortgage Corp. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA, 543\n\nF.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 2008)) (internal quotations omitted).\n\n\n\nIII.       DISCUSSION\n\n               On appeal, the appellants argue that the district court\n\nerred by extending its findings from the bench trial to extinguish\n\nthe Class 1 plaintiffs' claims against J&J.               It is undisputed that\n\nthe bench trial adjudicated only claims of Classes 2 and 3, not\n\nClass 1.       Consequently, it is also undisputed that the Class 1\n\nrepresentative      plaintiffs       did    not    participate    in   the   trial.\n\nFinally, it is clear from the record that the imposition of that\n\ntrigger was based on the district court's fact findings as to how\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      Application of the Rule 56 rubric makes some sense, in so far\nas application of Rule 12 would be seemingly impossible under the\ncircumstances, and judgment after trial under Rule 58 would make\nlittle sense given that the instant plaintiffs were not part of the\ntrial.\n\n                                          -12-\n\flarge a spread the Class 2 and Class 3 plaintiffs expected.           See\n\ngenerally In re Pharm., 491 F. Supp. 2d 20.\n\n            Against this backdrop, the district court's decision to\n\napply its trial findings to impose the 30% potential liability\n\ntrigger to the Class 1 plaintiffs, leading to entry of judgment as\n\nto the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims against J&J, appears problematic.\n\nThe 30% potential liability trigger, which was derived from the\n\ntestimony   of   Dr.   Raymond   Hartman,   represented   two   sequential\n\ndecisions by the district court:          first, acting as a gatekeeper\n\nunder Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993),\n\nthe district court admitted Dr. Hartman's testimony about industry\n\nexpectations into the record evidence; second, acting in its\n\ncapacity as factfinder, the district court credited that testimony\n\nand adopted the 30% potential liability trigger.           Both of these\n\ndecisions were within the power of the district court.\n\n            In extending these findings to necessarily encompass the\n\nexpectations of the Class 1 plaintiffs, however, the district court\n\nmay have exceeded its power.         Unlike the Class 2 and Class 3\n\nplaintiffs, whose claims under Chapter 93A were determined in a\n\nbench trial, it is undisputed that the Class 1 plaintiffs were not\n\nrepresented before the court in the previous trial.        Additionally,\n\nunlike the Class 2 and 3 plaintiffs who all proceeded under Chapter\n\n93A, the Class 1 plaintiffs include members who set forth claims\n\nunder various state laws, some of which contain jury trial rights.\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fAs a result, while the district court was empowered to find facts\n\nas to the former two classes, it had no basis upon which to apply\n\nthose findings to the latter class.\n\n          To enter summary judgment against the Class 1 plaintiffs,\n\nthe district court would have first had to view the facts in the\n\nlight most favorable to the plaintiffs as the nonmoving party, see\n\nFirst Marblehead Corp. v. House, 473 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2006),\n\nwhich is a very different enterprise from the factfinding engaged\n\nin at a bench trial.   Rule 56 also requires that the district court\n\nconclude that there are no genuine issues as to any material fact.\n\nYet the factfindings at the bench trial as to the Class 2 and Class\n\n3 plaintiffs' expectations regarding the size of the spreads were\n\nnot made with any deference to the Class 1 plaintiffs' potential\n\nevidence, and nothing in the record suggests that the district\n\ncourt applied the deferential standards required by Rule 56 at the\n\nJuly 2007 hearing or when it entered its judgment on the Class 1\n\nplaintiffs' claims against J&J.    Moreover, rather than making the\n\nnecessary finding that there were no genuine issues of material\n\nfact, the district court actually deleted language to this effect\n\n(\"no reasonable jury could find that the J&J Defendants' conduct\n\nviolated the consumer protection laws applicable to the Class 1\n\nclaims\") from the defendants' proposed order. The court also found\n\nin its June 2007 post-trial order that the issue of what liability\n\ntrigger to use for Remicade -- an issue that turned on ascertaining\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fthe appropriate industry expectations -- was a \"close call,\" In re\n\nPharm., 491 F. Supp. 2d at 104, thus indicating that, had the court\n\napplied the Rule 56 standards, it might well have found there to\n\nexist a genuine issue of material fact.                For these reasons,\n\nentering summary judgment as to the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims\n\nagainst J&J, on the record as we understand it, would have been\n\nerror.\n\n           J&J's arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.              Its\n\ncontention that the claims of Class 1 were not materially different\n\nfrom the claims of Class 2 and the consumer members of Class 3 says\n\nnothing   about   the   different    role   of   the   district   court   in\n\nadjudicating those claims in the context of a jury trial.                 Its\n\ncharacterization of the district court's decision to adopt the 30%\n\npotential liability trigger as \"legal\" (and therefore outside the\n\npurview of the jury) fails to account for the fact that the\n\ncreation of the 30% trigger depended on factual findings relating\n\nto the relevant expectations as to the size of spreads.                   And\n\nelsewhere we have rejected J&J's arguments that the district\n\ncourt's adoption of a 30% potential liability trigger was erroneous\n\nas a matter of law; those arguments do not provide \"alternative\n\ngrounds\" for affirming the district court, as urged by J&J.          See In\n\nre Pharm., No. 08-1056, ___ F.3d ___, slip op.\n\n           None of this is to say, however, that the judgment issued\n\nby the district court cannot be sustained or that this case must\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fnecessarily proceed to trial on the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims\n\nagainst J&J.       If the Rule 54 judgment on the Class 1 claims was\n\nintended to address only those claims brought under Ch. 93A, then\n\nthe judgment seemingly does not reach Class 1 claims arising under\n\nother states' consumer protection laws that may provide for trial\n\nby jury.     Additionally, if the Class 1 plaintiffs have evidence\n\n(for    example,    about    relevant     expectations          with    respect      to\n\nreasonable    spreads   in    the     context   of   the   spreads'      impact      on\n\nconsumer payments), then the district court ought to have a proffer\n\nof such evidence to assist it in deciding whether to grant a\n\nproperly framed summary judgment motion. As the Class 1 plaintiffs\n\nwere not participants in the bench trial, the record is lacking\n\nwith respect to whether the plaintiffs have any such relevant\n\nevidence on a material issue.             Again, nothing in this opinion\n\nshould be understood to preclude the district court from entering\n\njudgment   under    Rule    56   on   behalf    of   J&J   as    to    the   Class    1\n\nplaintiffs' claims. But if the district court does decide to enter\n\nsummary judgment, it must do so only after affording the Class 1\n\nplaintiffs the protections to which they are entitled under Rule\n\n56.\n\n\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n            Because we lack a clear understanding of both the scope\n\nof the district court's judgment and the reasons for the judgment,\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fwe will remand to the district court for additional explanation of\n\nits judgment.   Although we have considered retaining jurisdiction\n\nover the matter, in light of the fact that the district court may\n\nfind it necessary to take action beyond providing an explanation,\n\nwe instead VACATE and REMAND.

(collectively \"J &amp; J\"). The appellants contend that the district court improperly entered judgment against them before trial. For the reasons that follow, we remand this matter to the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>This appeal represents just one case in a sprawling, nationwide multi-district class action involving the pricing of physician-administered pharmaceutical drugs which were reimbursed by Medicare, private insurers and patients making co-insurance payments from 1991 through 2003. The gravamen of the nationwide litigation against the pharmaceutical companies is that they unfairly and deceptively inflated the drugs' \"average wholesale prices\" (\"AWPs\"), a price published by the pharmaceutical companies in various private industry publications and widely used as a benchmark for reimbursement payments, while simultaneously offering secret discounts and rebates to physicians. The result of this scheme was that the AWPs dramatically diverged from the physicians' actual acquisition costs, a divergence referred to as the \"spread,\" thereby creating a windfall profit for the physicians who bought the drugs at the lower prices but were reimbursed based on the higher prices. The plaintiffs further allege that the pharmaceutical companies exploited this system by \"marketing the spread,\" by which a company used the prospect of windfall profits to induce physicians to prescribe its drug, thereby protecting or increasing market share vis-a-vis competitor drugs. This case involves just a slice of the larger litigation: the claims against J &amp; J by Class 1 plaintiffsÂ—the group of natural persons nationwide who made co-payments based on AWP for relevant Medicare Part B drugs.<sup>[1]</sup> For a detailed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*233</span> discussion of this scheme, and of the district court's case management efforts, see <i>In re Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale Price Litigation,</i> No. 08-1056, 582 F.3d 156, 2009 WL 3019691 (1st Cir. Sept. 2009), and <i>In re Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale Price Litigation,</i> 491 F.Supp.2d 20 (D.Mass.2007). This opinion assumes familiarity with those two decisions.</p>\n<p>As part of the broader litigation, the district court held a twenty-day bench trial adjudicating the claims of the Class 2 and Class 3 plaintiffs, <i>see </i><i>In re Pharm. Industry Average Wholesale Price Litig.,</i> 233 F.R.D. 229, 231 (D.Mass.2006) (defining Classes 2 and 3), against a set of pharmaceutical companies, including J &amp; J. <i>See In re Pharm.,</i> 491 F.Supp.2d at 31 (\"This bench trial involved two Massachusetts classes. One class, Class 2, consists of third-party payors ('TPPs') in Massachusetts that reimburse Medicare beneficiaries for their statutory twenty percent coinsurance obligations under Medicare, known as Medigap insurance or supplemental insurance. The other class of plaintiffs, Class 3, consists of all third party payors, end-payors, consumers who make coinsurance payments, and consumers who have no insurance for these drugs in Massachusetts and who pay for drugs based on AWP.\" (footnotes omitted)). In June 2007, the district court entered a split judgment, finding in favor of the Class 2 and 3 plaintiffs as to some of the defendants but not others. <i>Id.</i> at 31-32 (summarizing findings).</p>\n<p>J &amp; J was one of the victorious defendants. Although the district court noted that the company's conduct was \"at times troubling,\" it ultimately found that J &amp; J's conduct had not damaged the class because the spread for the two relevant J &amp; J-manufactured drugs, Procrit (epoetin alfa) and Remicade (infliximab), had not substantially exceeded industry expectations about the size of the spread, and therefore J &amp; J's conduct did not rise to the level of egregiousness necessary to trigger liability under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 93A (\"Chapter 93A\"). <i>Id.</i> at 31, 103-04. In reaching this conclusion, the district court rejected the Class 2 plaintiffs' contention that <i>any</i> spread at all should trigger potential liability for the defendants (an approach that the court labeled the \"per se\" liability theory), and instead applied a 30% \"speed limit\" or \"yardstick\" for potential liability, whereby only spreads that exceeded 30% would trigger potential liability. The 30% potential liability trigger was also applied to the claims of the Class 3 plaintiffs. Because the spreads for Procrit and Remicade were approximately 30% or less during the class period, the district court declined to find liability as to either Class 2 or Class 3.</p>\n<p>On the strength of those findings, during a July 2007 conference relating to the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims against the Bristol Myers Squibb Company (which ultimately settled before trial), the district court characterized its post-trial findings as having cut off the claims of the Class 1 plaintiffs against J &amp; J. Specifically, the following exchange occurred between the district court and Steve Berman, the attorney representing the Class 1 plaintiffs:</p>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: ... So, there will be no more trials with respect to the first five defendants in Track 1 with respect to, as I understand it, Class 1....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BERMAN: There's one issue on Track 1, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Yeah?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BERMAN: And, that is Johnson &amp; Johnson. I know that you said that their drugs didn't exceed the 30 percent rule for the purposes of Class 2 and 3. But, it's our positionÂ—and we would like the opportunity to present this or maybe <span class=\"star-pagination\">*234</span> you've already decidedÂ—that the 30 percent would not apply to [Class] 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: I thought I ruled that. The 30 percent did apply to TrackÂ—to Class 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BERMAN: Well, you have a footnote that talks aboutÂ—implies that, but you did not rule in that way. That's your ruling, that we have no J &amp; J Class 1 trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: I thought it was not a footnote. I thought I went on and on about it. I think I went on and on about everything. So, maybe I ought to look at it again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BERMAN: I don't think you didÂ—</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: I think I said that I rejected plaintiffs' position that the per se liability for Class 1 and that I thought that the 30 percent speed limit should apply to Class 1 as well. And, that would be, I thought applicable to all of the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>So why is that not clear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BERMAN: Well, I didn't see that in your order, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: They've got it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BERMAN: At the time we negotiated theÂ—via that [BMS] settlement, both sides thought that was a risk that could go either way. And, we discussed that with the mediator. The mediator didn't think that it was clear either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: WellÂ—</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BERMAN: It's clear now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: It's clear now. And, I will look at it again. If it wasn't clear, it is clear. The 30 percent speed limit applies to Class 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I rejected a per se position. And, I have to go look through it again, because I thought it was clear. That's why I essentially had the expert go back and calculate the damages again. Because, the way he did it was he aggregated all the years when he did it with the 30 percent speed limit. He didn't back out theÂ—it might have been statute of limitations and on the specific [drugs]. That's why I needed a root calculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Otherwise, I could have done it. Right? On the per se. Because, he did it year by year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BERMAN: Correct, you could have, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: I could have done that. I mean ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BERMAN: But, we felt it was a different issue with the consumers, because there's no evidence that they had any knowledge of the so-called industry norm of 20, 25 percent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Well, I ruled to the contrary and I don't accept that position. And, I thought it was clear. If not, I'm making it clear now.</blockquote>\n<p>Seizing on this colloquy, J &amp; J began asking the district court to officially seal the fate of the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims: in August 2007, J &amp; J moved for final judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) (allowing the district court to enter final judgment as to \"one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties\" in a multi-party or multi-claim lawsuit); the next month, J &amp; J submitted a proposed order concluding that \"no reasonable jury could find that the J &amp; J Defendants' conduct violated the consumer protection laws applicable to the Class 1 claims\"; and in November 2007, J &amp; J again moved the district court for final judgment, asking it to effect its \"stated intention to enter judgment in favor of the J &amp; J Defendants with respect to Class 1\" and proposing the same conclusion that \"no reasonable jury could find that the J &amp; J Defendants' conduct violated the consumer protection laws applicable to the Class 1 claims.\"</p>\n<p>The Class 1 plaintiffs' responses to these efforts appear to have taken two different positions. In one response, filed by Attorney <span class=\"star-pagination\">*235</span> Donald Haviland, Jr. on behalf of the \"Class 1 and Class 3 Consumers,\" the Class 1 plaintiffs argued that the entry of judgment against them would \"unfairly and inappropriately limit\" their right \"to adjudicate their claims fully.\" A separate, later filing by the other attorneys representing the plaintiffs, including Mr. Berman, stated that the \"[p]laintiffs ... neither consent to, nor oppose\" the requested relief, but nonetheless argued, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims had never been adjudicated, and noted that the district court had not made the finding proposed by the Track 1 defendants.<sup>[2]</sup> The latter filing therefore requested that the Track 1 defendants' proposed finding be omitted from the district court's order.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The district court ultimately entered a final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) stating that \"the Class 2 and 3 claims against... the J &amp; J Defendants ... proceeded to a bench trial before the Court in November of 2006,\" and that \"[t]he Court ... dismissed the claims against the J &amp; J Defendants.\" The order continued:</p>\n<blockquote>As to the J &amp; J Defendants, the Court ruled, among other things, that although J &amp; J's conduct was troubling, it did not violate Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, in part because the spreads on the J &amp; J Defendants' subject drugs (ProcritÂ® and RemicadeÂ®) never substantially exceeded the range of spreads generally expected by the industry and government. [<i>In re Pharm.,</i>] 491 F.Supp.2d at 104. As a result, the Court ruled that the claims of Class 2 and Class 3 should be dismissed. <i>Id.</i> at 109. The claims by members of Class 1 are dismissed for the same reason.</blockquote>\n<p>The order did not include the Track 1 defendants' proposed finding that \"no reasonable jury could find that the J &amp; J Defendants' conduct violated the consumer protection laws applicable to the Class 1 claims.\"</p>\n<p>The Class 1 plaintiffs, which include neither industry nor government, appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>We begin by noting that the district court's use of the word \"dismissed\" in its November 2007 order entering judgment, and the fact that it made its findings as to Class 1 after the bench trial involving the Class 2 and 3 plaintiffs, admits of some doubt as to the precise procedural grounding of the judgment. At oral argument, counsel for J &amp; J represented, without objection, that the district court's judgment was entered in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. The district court, however, made no explicit reference to that Rule, or to summary judgment in general. Although we consider here the consequences of this having been a summary judgment, ultimately we believe the wisest course is to remand to the district court for further explanation of its ruling and, if necessary, additional proceedings.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*236</span> We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <i>Sullivan v. City of Springfield,</i> 561 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir.2009). \"Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" <i>Id.</i> (<i>citing</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <i>New Fed Mortgage Corp. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA,</i> 543 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir.2008)) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>On appeal, the appellants argue that the district court erred by extending its findings from the bench trial to extinguish the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims against J &amp; J. It is undisputed that the bench trial adjudicated only claims of Classes 2 and 3, not Class 1. Consequently, it is also undisputed that the Class 1 representative plaintiffs did not participate in the trial. Finally, it is clear from the record that the imposition of that trigger was based on the district court's fact findings as to how large a spread the Class 2 and Class 3 plaintiffs expected. <i>See generally In re Pharm.,</i> 491 F.Supp.2d 20.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, the district court's decision to apply its trial findings to impose the 30% potential liability trigger to the Class 1 plaintiffs, leading to entry of judgment as to the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims against J &amp; J, appears problematic. The 30% potential liability trigger, which was derived from the testimony of Dr. Raymond Hartman, represented two sequential decisions by the district court: first, acting as a gatekeeper under <i>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc.,</i> 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), the district court admitted Dr. Hartman's testimony about industry expectations into the record evidence; second, acting in its capacity as factfinder, the district court credited that testimony and adopted the 30% potential liability trigger. Both of these decisions were within the power of the district court.</p>\n<p>In extending these findings to necessarily encompass the expectations of the Class 1 plaintiffs, however, the district court may have exceeded its power. Unlike the Class 2 and Class 3 plaintiffs, whose claims under Chapter 93A were determined in a bench trial, it is undisputed that the Class 1 plaintiffs were not represented before the court in the previous trial. Additionally, unlike the Class 2 and 3 plaintiffs who all proceeded under Chapter 93A, the Class 1 plaintiffs include members who set forth claims under various state laws, some of which contain jury trial rights. As a result, while the district court was empowered to find facts as to the former two classes, it had no basis upon which to apply those findings to the latter class.</p>\n<p>To enter summary judgment against the Class 1 plaintiffs, the district court would have first had to view the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs as the nonmoving party, <i>see </i><i>First Marblehead Corp. v. House,</i> 473 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2006), which is a very different enterprise from the factfinding engaged in at a bench trial. Rule 56 also requires that the district court conclude that there are no genuine issues as to any material fact. Yet the factfindings at the bench trial as to the Class 2 and Class 3 plaintiffs' expectations regarding the size of the spreads were not made with any deference to the Class 1 plaintiffs' potential evidence, and nothing in the record suggests that the district court applied the deferential standards required by Rule 56 at the July 2007 hearing or when it entered its judgment on the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims against J &amp; J. Moreover, rather than making the necessary finding that there were no genuine issues of material fact, the district court actually deleted language to this effect (\"no reasonable jury could find that the J <span class=\"star-pagination\">*237</span> &amp; J Defendants' conduct violated the consumer protection laws applicable to the Class 1 claims\") from the defendants' proposed order. The court also found in its June 2007 post-trial order that the issue of what liability trigger to use for RemicadeÂ—an issue that turned on ascertaining the appropriate industry expectationsÂ— was a \"close call,\" <i>In re Pharm.,</i> 491 F.Supp.2d at 104, thus indicating that, had the court applied the Rule 56 standards, it might well have found there to exist a genuine issue of material fact. For these reasons, entering summary judgment as to the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims against J &amp; J, on the record as we understand it, would have been error.</p>\n<p>J &amp; J's arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. Its contention that the claims of Class 1 were not materially different from the claims of Class 2 and the consumer members of Class 3 says nothing about the different role of the district court in adjudicating those claims in the context of a jury trial. Its characterization of the district court's decision to adopt the 30% potential liability trigger as \"legal\" (and therefore outside the purview of the jury) fails to account for the fact that the creation of the 30% trigger depended on <i>factual</i> findings relating to the relevant expectations as to the size of spreads. And elsewhere we have rejected J &amp; J's arguments that the district court's adoption of a 30% potential liability trigger was erroneous as a matter of law; those arguments do not provide \"alternative grounds\" for affirming the district court, as urged by J &amp; J. <i>See </i><i>In re Pharm.,</i> No. 08-1056, 582 F.3d 156.</p>\n<p>None of this is to say, however, that the judgment issued by the district court cannot be sustained or that this case must necessarily proceed to trial on the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims against J &amp; J. If the Rule 54 judgment on the Class 1 claims was intended to address only those claims brought under Ch. 93A, then the judgment seemingly does not reach Class 1 claims arising under other states' consumer protection laws that may provide for trial by jury. Additionally, if the Class 1 plaintiffs have evidence (for example, about relevant expectations with respect to reasonable spreads in the context of the spreads' impact on consumer payments), then the district court ought to have a proffer of such evidence to assist it in deciding whether to grant a properly framed summary judgment motion. As the Class 1 plaintiffs were not participants in the bench trial, the record is lacking with respect to whether the plaintiffs have any such relevant evidence on a material issue. Again, nothing in this opinion should be understood to preclude the district court from entering judgment under Rule 56 on behalf of J &amp; J as to the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims. But if the district court does decide to enter summary judgment, it must do so only after affording the Class 1 plaintiffs the protections to which they are entitled under Rule 56.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Because we lack a clear understanding of both the scope of the district court's judgment and the reasons for the judgment, we will remand to the district court for additional explanation of its judgment. Although we have considered retaining jurisdiction over the matter, in light of the fact that the district court may find it necessary to take action beyond providing an explanation, we instead VACATE and REMAND. The parties' rights to appeal are preserved.</p>\n<p>No costs are awarded.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[**]  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  \"Class 1: Medicare Part B Co-Payment Class\" is defined as:\n</p>\n<p>All natural persons nationwide who made, or who incurred an obligation enforceable at the time of judgment to make, a co-payment based on AWP for a Medicare Part B covered Subject Drug that was manufactured by ... the Johnson &amp; Johnson Group (Johnson &amp; Johnson, Centocor, Inc., Ortho Biotech, McNeil-PPC, Inc., and Janssen Pharmaceutica Products, L.P.).

(collectively \"J &amp; J\"). The appellants contend that the district court improperly entered judgment against them before trial. For the reasons that follow, we remand this matter to the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>This appeal represents just one case in a sprawling, nationwide multi-district class action involving the pricing of physician-administered pharmaceutical drugs which were reimbursed by Medicare, private insurers and patients making co-insurance payments from 1991 through 2003. The gravamen of the nationwide litigation against the pharmaceutical companies is that they unfairly and deceptively inflated the drugs' \"average wholesale prices\" (\"AWPs\"), a price published by the pharmaceutical companies in various private industry publications and widely used as a benchmark for reimbursement payments, while simultaneously offering secret discounts and rebates to physicians. The result of this scheme was that the AWPs dramatically diverged from the physicians' actual acquisition costs, a divergence referred to as the \"spread,\" thereby creating a windfall profit for the physicians who bought the drugs at the lower prices but were reimbursed based on the higher prices. The plaintiffs further allege that the pharmaceutical companies exploited this system by \"marketing the spread,\" by which a company used the prospect of windfall profits to induce physicians to prescribe its drug, thereby protecting or increasing market share vis-a-vis competitor drugs. This case involves just a slice of the larger litigation: the claims against J &amp; J by Class 1 plaintiffsÂ—the group of natural persons nationwide who made co-payments based on AWP for relevant Medicare Part B drugs.<sup>[1]</sup> For a detailed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*233</span> discussion of this scheme, and of the district court's case management efforts, see <i>In re Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale Price Litigation,</i> No. 08-1056, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204019\"><a href=\"/opinion/204019/in-re-pharm-industry-average-wholesale-price-lit/\"><span class=\"volume\">582</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3019691</span></span> (1st Cir. Sept. 2009), and <i>In re Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale Price Litigation,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2527316\"><a href=\"/opinion/2527316/in-re-pharmaceutical-indus-average-wholesale-price/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2007). This opinion assumes familiarity with those two decisions.</p>\n<p>As part of the broader litigation, the district court held a twenty-day bench trial adjudicating the claims of the Class 2 and Class 3 plaintiffs, <i>see </i><i>In re Pharm. Industry Average Wholesale Price Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></span>, 231 (D.Mass.2006) (defining Classes 2 and 3), against a set of pharmaceutical companies, including J &amp; J. <i>See In re Pharm.,</i> 491 F.Supp.2d at 31 (\"This bench trial involved two Massachusetts classes. One class, Class 2, consists of third-party payors ('TPPs') in Massachusetts that reimburse Medicare beneficiaries for their statutory twenty percent coinsurance obligations under Medicare, known as Medigap insurance or supplemental insurance. The other class of plaintiffs, Class 3, consists of all third party payors, end-payors, consumers who make coinsurance payments, and consumers who have no insurance for these drugs in Massachusetts and who pay for drugs based on AWP.\" (footnotes omitted)). In June 2007, the district court entered a split judgment, finding in favor of the Class 2 and 3 plaintiffs as to some of the defendants but not others. <i>Id.</i> at 31-32 (summarizing findings).</p>\n<p>J &amp; J was one of the victorious defendants. Although the district court noted that the company's conduct was \"at times troubling,\" it ultimately found that J &amp; J's conduct had not damaged the class because the spread for the two relevant J &amp; J-manufactured drugs, Procrit (epoetin alfa) and Remicade (infliximab), had not substantially exceeded industry expectations about the size of the spread, and therefore J &amp; J's conduct did not rise to the level of egregiousness necessary to trigger liability under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 93A (\"Chapter 93A\"). <i>Id.</i> at 31, 103-04. In reaching this conclusion, the district court rejected the Class 2 plaintiffs' contention that <i>any</i> spread at all should trigger potential liability for the defendants (an approach that the court labeled the \"per se\" liability theory), and instead applied a 30% \"speed limit\" or \"yardstick\" for potential liability, whereby only spreads that exceeded 30% would trigger potential liability. The 30% potential liability trigger was also applied to the claims of the Class 3 plaintiffs. Because the spreads for Procrit and Remicade were approximately 30% or less during the class period, the district court declined to find liability as to either Class 2 or Class 3.</p>\n<p>On the strength of those findings, during a July 2007 conference relating to the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims against the Bristol Myers Squibb Company (which ultimately settled before trial), the district court characterized its post-trial findings as having cut off the claims of the Class 1 plaintiffs against J &amp; J. Specifically, the following exchange occurred between the district court and Steve Berman, the attorney representing the Class 1 plaintiffs:</p>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: ... So, there will be no more trials with respect to the first five defendants in Track 1 with respect to, as I understand it, Class 1....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BERMAN: There's one issue on Track 1, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Yeah?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BERMAN: And, that is Johnson &amp; Johnson. I know that you said that their drugs didn't exceed the 30 percent rule for the purposes of Class 2 and 3. But, it's our positionÂ—and we would like the opportunity to present this or maybe <span class=\"star-pagination\">*234</span> you've already decidedÂ—that the 30 percent would not apply to [Class] 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: I thought I ruled that. The 30 percent did apply to TrackÂ—to Class 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BERMAN: Well, you have a footnote that talks aboutÂ—implies that, but you did not rule in that way. That's your ruling, that we have no J &amp; J Class 1 trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: I thought it was not a footnote. I thought I went on and on about it. I think I went on and on about everything. So, maybe I ought to look at it again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BERMAN: I don't think you didÂ—</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: I think I said that I rejected plaintiffs' position that the per se liability for Class 1 and that I thought that the 30 percent speed limit should apply to Class 1 as well. And, that would be, I thought applicable to all of the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>So why is that not clear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BERMAN: Well, I didn't see that in your order, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: They've got it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BERMAN: At the time we negotiated theÂ—via that [BMS] settlement, both sides thought that was a risk that could go either way. And, we discussed that with the mediator. The mediator didn't think that it was clear either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: WellÂ—</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BERMAN: It's clear now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: It's clear now. And, I will look at it again. If it wasn't clear, it is clear. The 30 percent speed limit applies to Class 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I rejected a per se position. And, I have to go look through it again, because I thought it was clear. That's why I essentially had the expert go back and calculate the damages again. Because, the way he did it was he aggregated all the years when he did it with the 30 percent speed limit. He didn't back out theÂ—it might have been statute of limitations and on the specific [drugs]. That's why I needed a root calculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Otherwise, I could have done it. Right? On the per se. Because, he did it year by year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BERMAN: Correct, you could have, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: I could have done that. I mean ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BERMAN: But, we felt it was a different issue with the consumers, because there's no evidence that they had any knowledge of the so-called industry norm of 20, 25 percent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Well, I ruled to the contrary and I don't accept that position. And, I thought it was clear. If not, I'm making it clear now.</blockquote>\n<p>Seizing on this colloquy, J &amp; J began asking the district court to officially seal the fate of the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims: in August 2007, J &amp; J moved for final judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) (allowing the district court to enter final judgment as to \"one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties\" in a multi-party or multi-claim lawsuit); the next month, J &amp; J submitted a proposed order concluding that \"no reasonable jury could find that the J &amp; J Defendants' conduct violated the consumer protection laws applicable to the Class 1 claims\"; and in November 2007, J &amp; J again moved the district court for final judgment, asking it to effect its \"stated intention to enter judgment in favor of the J &amp; J Defendants with respect to Class 1\" and proposing the same conclusion that \"no reasonable jury could find that the J &amp; J Defendants' conduct violated the consumer protection laws applicable to the Class 1 claims.\"</p>\n<p>The Class 1 plaintiffs' responses to these efforts appear to have taken two different positions. In one response, filed by Attorney <span class=\"star-pagination\">*235</span> Donald Haviland, Jr. on behalf of the \"Class 1 and Class 3 Consumers,\" the Class 1 plaintiffs argued that the entry of judgment against them would \"unfairly and inappropriately limit\" their right \"to adjudicate their claims fully.\" A separate, later filing by the other attorneys representing the plaintiffs, including Mr. Berman, stated that the \"[p]laintiffs ... neither consent to, nor oppose\" the requested relief, but nonetheless argued, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims had never been adjudicated, and noted that the district court had not made the finding proposed by the Track 1 defendants.<sup>[2]</sup> The latter filing therefore requested that the Track 1 defendants' proposed finding be omitted from the district court's order.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The district court ultimately entered a final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) stating that \"the Class 2 and 3 claims against... the J &amp; J Defendants ... proceeded to a bench trial before the Court in November of 2006,\" and that \"[t]he Court ... dismissed the claims against the J &amp; J Defendants.\" The order continued:</p>\n<blockquote>As to the J &amp; J Defendants, the Court ruled, among other things, that although J &amp; J's conduct was troubling, it did not violate Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, in part because the spreads on the J &amp; J Defendants' subject drugs (ProcritÂ® and RemicadeÂ®) never substantially exceeded the range of spreads generally expected by the industry and government. [<i>In re Pharm.,</i>] 491 F.Supp.2d at 104. As a result, the Court ruled that the claims of Class 2 and Class 3 should be dismissed. <i>Id.</i> at 109. The claims by members of Class 1 are dismissed for the same reason.</blockquote>\n<p>The order did not include the Track 1 defendants' proposed finding that \"no reasonable jury could find that the J &amp; J Defendants' conduct violated the consumer protection laws applicable to the Class 1 claims.\"</p>\n<p>The Class 1 plaintiffs, which include neither industry nor government, appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>We begin by noting that the district court's use of the word \"dismissed\" in its November 2007 order entering judgment, and the fact that it made its findings as to Class 1 after the bench trial involving the Class 2 and 3 plaintiffs, admits of some doubt as to the precise procedural grounding of the judgment. At oral argument, counsel for J &amp; J represented, without objection, that the district court's judgment was entered in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. The district court, however, made no explicit reference to that Rule, or to summary judgment in general. Although we consider here the consequences of this having been a summary judgment, ultimately we believe the wisest course is to remand to the district court for further explanation of its ruling and, if necessary, additional proceedings.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*236</span> We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <i>Sullivan v. City of Springfield,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203736\"><a href=\"/opinion/203736/sullivan-v-city-of-springfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.2009). \"Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" <i>Id.</i> (<i>citing</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <i>New Fed Mortgage Corp. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203500\"><a href=\"/opinion/203500/new-fed-mortg-corp-v-nat-union-fire-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.2008)) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>On appeal, the appellants argue that the district court erred by extending its findings from the bench trial to extinguish the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims against J &amp; J. It is undisputed that the bench trial adjudicated only claims of Classes 2 and 3, not Class 1. Consequently, it is also undisputed that the Class 1 representative plaintiffs did not participate in the trial. Finally, it is clear from the record that the imposition of that trigger was based on the district court's fact findings as to how large a spread the Class 2 and Class 3 plaintiffs expected. <i>See generally In re Pharm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2527316\"><a href=\"/opinion/2527316/in-re-pharmaceutical-indus-average-wholesale-price/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, the district court's decision to apply its trial findings to impose the 30% potential liability trigger to the Class 1 plaintiffs, leading to entry of judgment as to the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims against J &amp; J, appears problematic. The 30% potential liability trigger, which was derived from the testimony of Dr. Raymond Hartman, represented two sequential decisions by the district court: first, acting as a gatekeeper under <i>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2786</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span> (1993), the district court admitted Dr. Hartman's testimony about industry expectations into the record evidence; second, acting in its capacity as factfinder, the district court credited that testimony and adopted the 30% potential liability trigger. Both of these decisions were within the power of the district court.</p>\n<p>In extending these findings to necessarily encompass the expectations of the Class 1 plaintiffs, however, the district court may have exceeded its power. Unlike the Class 2 and Class 3 plaintiffs, whose claims under Chapter 93A were determined in a bench trial, it is undisputed that the Class 1 plaintiffs were not represented before the court in the previous trial. Additionally, unlike the Class 2 and 3 plaintiffs who all proceeded under Chapter 93A, the Class 1 plaintiffs include members who set forth claims under various state laws, some of which contain jury trial rights. As a result, while the district court was empowered to find facts as to the former two classes, it had no basis upon which to apply those findings to the latter class.</p>\n<p>To enter summary judgment against the Class 1 plaintiffs, the district court would have first had to view the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs as the nonmoving party, <i>see </i><i>First Marblehead Corp. v. House,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796420\"><a href=\"/opinion/796420/the-first-marblehead-corp-v-gregory-house/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.2006), which is a very different enterprise from the factfinding engaged in at a bench trial. Rule 56 also requires that the district court conclude that there are no genuine issues as to any material fact. Yet the factfindings at the bench trial as to the Class 2 and Class 3 plaintiffs' expectations regarding the size of the spreads were not made with any deference to the Class 1 plaintiffs' potential evidence, and nothing in the record suggests that the district court applied the deferential standards required by Rule 56 at the July 2007 hearing or when it entered its judgment on the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims against J &amp; J. Moreover, rather than making the necessary finding that there were no genuine issues of material fact, the district court actually deleted language to this effect (\"no reasonable jury could find that the J <span class=\"star-pagination\">*237</span> &amp; J Defendants' conduct violated the consumer protection laws applicable to the Class 1 claims\") from the defendants' proposed order. The court also found in its June 2007 post-trial order that the issue of what liability trigger to use for RemicadeÂ—an issue that turned on ascertaining the appropriate industry expectationsÂ— was a \"close call,\" <i>In re Pharm.,</i> 491 F.Supp.2d at 104, thus indicating that, had the court applied the Rule 56 standards, it might well have found there to exist a genuine issue of material fact. For these reasons, entering summary judgment as to the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims against J &amp; J, on the record as we understand it, would have been error.</p>\n<p>J &amp; J's arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. Its contention that the claims of Class 1 were not materially different from the claims of Class 2 and the consumer members of Class 3 says nothing about the different role of the district court in adjudicating those claims in the context of a jury trial. Its characterization of the district court's decision to adopt the 30% potential liability trigger as \"legal\" (and therefore outside the purview of the jury) fails to account for the fact that the creation of the 30% trigger depended on <i>factual</i> findings relating to the relevant expectations as to the size of spreads. And elsewhere we have rejected J &amp; J's arguments that the district court's adoption of a 30% potential liability trigger was erroneous as a matter of law; those arguments do not provide \"alternative grounds\" for affirming the district court, as urged by J &amp; J. <i>See </i><i>In re Pharm.,</i> No. 08-1056, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204019\"><a href=\"/opinion/204019/in-re-pharm-industry-average-wholesale-price-lit/\"><span class=\"volume\">582</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>None of this is to say, however, that the judgment issued by the district court cannot be sustained or that this case must necessarily proceed to trial on the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims against J &amp; J. If the Rule 54 judgment on the Class 1 claims was intended to address only those claims brought under Ch. 93A, then the judgment seemingly does not reach Class 1 claims arising under other states' consumer protection laws that may provide for trial by jury. Additionally, if the Class 1 plaintiffs have evidence (for example, about relevant expectations with respect to reasonable spreads in the context of the spreads' impact on consumer payments), then the district court ought to have a proffer of such evidence to assist it in deciding whether to grant a properly framed summary judgment motion. As the Class 1 plaintiffs were not participants in the bench trial, the record is lacking with respect to whether the plaintiffs have any such relevant evidence on a material issue. Again, nothing in this opinion should be understood to preclude the district court from entering judgment under Rule 56 on behalf of J &amp; J as to the Class 1 plaintiffs' claims. But if the district court does decide to enter summary judgment, it must do so only after affording the Class 1 plaintiffs the protections to which they are entitled under Rule 56.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Because we lack a clear understanding of both the scope of the district court's judgment and the reasons for the judgment, we will remand to the district court for additional explanation of its judgment. Although we have considered retaining jurisdiction over the matter, in light of the fact that the district court may find it necessary to take action beyond providing an explanation, we instead VACATE and REMAND. The parties' rights to appeal are preserved.</p>\n<p>No costs are awarded.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[**]  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  \"Class 1: Medicare Part B Co-Payment Class\" is defined as:\n</p>\n<p>All natural persons nationwide who made, or who incurred an obligation enforceable at the time of judgment to make, a co-payment based on AWP for a Medicare Part B covered Subject Drug that was manufactured by ... the Johnson &amp; Johnson Group (Johnson &amp; Johnson, Centocor, Inc., Ortho Biotech, McNeil-PPC, Inc., and Janssen Pharmaceutica Products, L.P.).
