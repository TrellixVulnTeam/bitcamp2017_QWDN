Buchanan, Jr., with whom Charles L. Glerum, Joseph\nM. Downes III, and Choate, Hall & Stewart LLP were on brief, for\nappellee Charles Glerum, Examiner.\n\n\n                         August 31, 2005\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.      This case presents a matter of\n\nfirst impression in our circuit, requiring us to interpret 11\n\nU.S.C. § 107(b)(2), which provides an exception to the rule of\n\npublic access to papers filed in a bankruptcy case for material\n\nthat is \"scandalous or defamatory.\"        Appellants Charles and Gary\n\nGitto (collectively, \"the Gittos\"), who were formerly associated\n\nwith a company that has since filed for bankruptcy protection,\n\nassert that an investigative report (\"Report\") compiled by a court-\n\nappointed    bankruptcy   examiner    (\"Examiner\")   falls   within   the\n\n§ 107(b)(2) exception and that it must therefore be redacted or\n\nsealed.     The bankruptcy court rejected this contention, finding\n\nthat the appellants had not demonstrated that the material at issue\n\nwas scandalous or defamatory and that it therefore must be publicly\n\navailable under 11 U.S.C. § 107(a).        The district court affirmed,\n\nalthough it applied a different interpretation of § 107(b)(2) than\n\nthe one adopted by the bankruptcy court.\n\n            On appeal, the Gittos advance a reading of § 107(b)(2)\n\nthat is broader than the one used by either the bankruptcy court or\n\nthe district court, and assert that they are entitled to protection\n\nunder that exception.     The appellees, two media organizations --\n\nWorcester Telegram & Gazette Corp. (\"WT&G\") and MediaNews Group,\n\nInc. (\"MediaNews\") -- and the Examiner, urge us to reject the\n\nGittos' interpretation of § 107(b)(2) and to find that the public\n\nhas a right of access to the Report.\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f                 Although     we     modify    somewhat     the   interpretation       of\n\n§ 107(b)(2)set forth by the district court, we affirm its decision\n\nthat the public has a right of access to the Report.1\n\n                                               I.\n\n                 Gitto      Global    Corp.       (\"Gitto    Global\"),     a    plastics\n\nmanufacturer in Lunenberg, Massachusetts, filed for Chapter 11\n\nbankruptcy on September 24, 2004 amid allegations of financial\n\ndistress and accounting irregularities.                     Shortly thereafter, the\n\nbankruptcy court appointed an Examiner to \"begin an investigation\n\ninto       the   existence      of    any     pre[-]petition      fraud,   dishonesty,\n\nincompetence, misconduct, mismanagement, or irregularity in the\n\nmanagement and business affairs of the Debtor.\"                      The Examiner was\n\nalso instructed to \"file a statement with the Court . . . reporting\n\nthe preliminary or final findings of the Examiner, along with any\n\nrecommendations of the Examiner for further investigation.\"                           The\n\npurpose      of       the   investigation      and    the   Report   was   to      develop\n\ninformation for use in potential proceedings against Gitto Global.\n\n                 On    December      8,   2004,     the   Examiner   filed     a    motion\n\nrequesting that the court authorize him to submit the Report (which\n\nhad not yet been filed) under seal and have it impounded pending a\n\nfurther order of the court.                 In an order dated December 9, 2004,\n\nthe court allowed the motion, subject to a requirement that any\n\n\n       1\n      In light of this disposition, we do not reach the claim by\nWT&G and MediaNews that there is a First Amendment right of public\naccess to the full Report. See infra note 3.\n\n                                              -4-\n\fparty in interest be allowed to file a motion seeking release of\n\nthe Report.   On January 5, 2005, after receiving several motions\n\nseeking access to the Report upon its filing, the court modified\n\nits December 9 order to require that within ten days of filing the\n\nReport, the Examiner \"provide each person named in the report . . .\n\nwith a copy of only that portion or portions of the report that\n\nrelate to the individual.\" The modified order also invited motions\n\nfrom individuals seeking to seal or redact the report, as well as\n\nobjections to motions to seal or redact.   The Examiner filed his\n\nReport under seal on January 7, 2004 and served redacted copies on\n\napproximately 120 individuals pursuant to the court's January 5\n\norder.\n\n          Among those who received redacted copies of the Report\n\nwere appellant Gary Gitto, part-owner and former CEO of Gitto\n\nGlobal, and appellant Charles Gitto, who held himself out as\n\nchairman of Gitto Global and is Gary Gitto's father.    The Gittos\n\nfiled motions requesting that the Report remain under seal, as did\n\napproximately twenty-four other individuals. In their motions, the\n\nGittos argued that there was no right of public access to the\n\nReport under either the common law or the First Amendment.    Gary\n\nGitto further argued that the Report contained scandalous and\n\ndefamatory material within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. § 107(b)(2),\n\nand therefore that the usual presumption of public access under\n\n§ 107(a) did not apply.   Appellees WT&G and MediaNews, both news\n\n\n                               -5-\n\forganizations, opposed the motions to seal.       The appellees argued\n\nthat there is a right of public access to the Report under the\n\nFirst Amendment, the common law, and § 107(a), and that the\n\nappellants   had   not   demonstrated   that   the   Report   contained\n\ndefamatory matter for purposes of § 107(b)(2).\n\n          On February 9, 2005, after a hearing on the various\n\nmotions, the bankruptcy court concluded in a memorandum that there\n\nwas nothing scandalous or defamatory in the Report.       It ruled that\n\nthe entire Report (with specific bank account numbers redacted\n\npursuant to the 11 U.S.C. § 107(b)(1) exception to public access\n\nfor confidential information) should be made publicly available\n\npursuant to § 107(a) and the common law presumption of access.       In\n\nlight of its ruling on the statutory and common law claims, the\n\nbankruptcy court found it unnecessary to decide whether there was\n\nalso a First Amendment right of public access to the Report.\n\n          Gary and Charles Gitto appealed the bankruptcy court's\n\ndecision to the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts.2    The district court affirmed.      Despite adopting a\n\nbroader definition of the term \"defamatory\" than the bankruptcy\n\ncourt had used, the district court agreed that there was no basis\n\nto seal or redact the Report under § 107(b)(2) and therefore that\n\n\n     2\n      Charles Gitto filed his initial motion to seal and his appeal\nto the district court on behalf of both himself and Tradex Corp.,\na corporation that he apparently owns and controls, and that was a\nGitto Global creditor. Tradex Corp. is not identified as a party\nto this appeal, however.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f§ 107(a) dictated public access.        The court also concluded that a\n\ncommon law analysis would lead to the same result and, like the\n\nbankruptcy court, found it unnecessary to reach the appellees'\n\nclaim of a First Amendment right of access.         This appeal followed.\n\n                                   II.\n\n          The   primary    issue   on    appeal    is    the     definition   of\n\n\"defamatory\" as that term is used in 11 U.S.C. § 107(b)(2).             Before\n\nturning to that difficult question, however, we must describe the\n\ncommon law presumption of access to court filings.\n\nA.        Common law presumption of access\n\n          Under   the     common   law,    there        is   a   long-standing\n\npresumption of public access to judicial records.                 See Nixon v.\n\nWarner Communications, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978); see also In\n\nre Boston Herald, Inc., 321 F.3d 174, 189 (1st Cir. 2003).3               This\n\npresumption of access \"helps safeguard the integrity, quality, and\n\nrespect in our judicial system, and permits the public to keep a\n\nwatchful eye on the workings of public agencies.\"                  In re Orion\n\n\n\n     3\n      As we noted in In re Boston Herald, the Supreme Court has\nalso \"recognized a qualified First Amendment right of access to\ncertain judicial proceedings and documents.\" 321 F.3d at 182. It\nis unclear whether the constitutional right of access would attach\nto the type of document at issue in this case, namely a report\nfiled   by   a  bankruptcy   examiner   pursuant   to  11   U.S.C.\n§ 1106(a)(4)(A).    See In re Boston Herald, 321 F.3d at 182\n(describing the framework for determining \"if a constitutional\nright of access applies to particular documents\").      Given our\nconclusion that there is a right of public access to the Report\nunder 11 U.S.C. § 107, we need not determine whether there is also\na right of public access under the First Amendment.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fPictures Corp., 21 F.3d 24, 26 (2d Cir. 1994) (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citations omitted).      Despite these important interests\n\nadvanced by public access to judicial records, the right of access\n\nis not absolute.    As the Supreme Court has recognized, \"[e]very\n\ncourt has supervisory power over its own records and files, and\n\naccess has been denied where court files might have become a\n\nvehicle for improper purposes.\"      Nixon, 435 U.S. at 598.         Courts\n\nhave exercised their discretion under the common law to abrogate\n\nthe right of public access where doing so was necessary to prevent\n\njudicial records from being \"'used to gratify private spite or\n\npromote public scandal[,]'\" id. (quoting In re Caswell, 29 A. 259\n\n(1893)), or to prevent their records from becoming \"reservoirs of\n\nlibelous statements for press consumption or . . . sources of\n\nbusiness information that might harm a litigant's competitive\n\nstanding.\"     Id. (citations omitted).       Although these examples\n\ndemonstrate that it is within a court's discretion to curtail the\n\ncommon   law   presumption   of   public   access,   \"[o]nly   the    most\n\ncompelling reasons can justify non-disclosure of judicial records.\"\n\nFTC v. Standard Fin. Mgmt. Corp., 830 F.2d 404, 410 (1st Cir. 1987)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nB.         11 U.S.C. § 107\n\n           In the bankruptcy context, the right of public access is\n\ncodified in a specific statutory provision, 11 U.S.C. § 107.\n\nSection 107, which Congress enacted in 1978, establishes a broad\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fright of public access, subject only to limited exceptions set\n\nforth in the statute, to all papers filed in a bankruptcy case.\n\nSpecifically, 11 U.S.C. § 107(a) provides\n\n     Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a\n     paper filed in a case under [the Bankruptcy Code] and the\n     dockets of a bankruptcy court are public records and open\n     to examination by an entity at reasonable times without\n     charge.\n\nAs one of our sister circuits has explained,\n\n     [s]ection 107(a) is rooted in the right of public access\n     to judicial proceedings, a principle long-recognized in\n     the common law and buttressed by the First Amendment.\n     This governmental interest is of special importance in\n     the bankruptcy arena, as unrestricted access to judicial\n     records fosters confidence among creditors regarding the\n     fairness of the bankruptcy system.\n\nIn re Crawford, 194 F.3d 954, 960 (9th Cir. 1999); see also In re\n\nBell & Beckwith, 44 B.R. 661, 664 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 1984) (\"Public\n\nscrutiny is the means by which the persons for whom the system is\n\nto benefit are able to insure its integrity and protect their\n\nrights.   This   policy   of   open   inspection,   established   in   the\n\nBankruptcy Code itself, is fundamental to the operation of the\n\nbankruptcy system and is the best means of avoiding any suggestion\n\nof impropriety that might or could be raised.\").            It is thus\n\nfitting that the coverage of § 107(a) is \"sweeping,\" see William T.\n\nBodoh and Michelle M. Morgan, Protective Orders in the Bankruptcy\n\nCourt: The Congressional Mandate of Bankruptcy Code Section 107 and\n\nIts Constitutional Implications (hereinafter Bodoh & Morgan), 24\n\nHastings Const. L.Q. 67, 82 (1996), extending to \"all papers filed\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fin a bankruptcy case,\" H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, at 317 (1977); S. Rep.\n\nNo. 95-989, at 30 (1978) (emphasis added).\n\n          There are only two exceptions to the broad § 107(a) right\n\nof public access, both codified in § 107(b):\n\n     On request of a party in interest, the bankruptcy court\n     shall, and on the bankruptcy court's own motion, the\n     bankruptcy court may --\n     (1) protect an entity with respect to a trade secret or\n     confidential   research,  development,   or  commercial\n     information; or\n     (2) protect a person with respect to scandalous or\n     defamatory matter contained in a paper filed in a case\n     under [the Bankruptcy Code].\n\nIn other words, if a paper filed in bankruptcy court fits within\n\n§ 107(b)(1) or (2), \"[p]rotection is mandatory when requested by a\n\n'party in interest.'\"   2 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 107.03 (15th ed.\n\nrev. 2005).4\n\n          Together, the two components of § 107 -- the broad right\n\nof access created in § 107(a) and the exceptions set forth in\n\n\n     4\n      The procedure for implementing § 107(b) is set forth in Fed.\nR. Bankr. P. 9018:\n\n     On motion or on its own initiative, with or without\n     notice, the court may make any order which justice\n     requires (1) to protect the estate or any entity in\n     respect of a trade secret or other confidential research,\n     development, or commercial information, (2) to protect\n     any entity against scandalous or defamatory matter\n     contained in any paper filed in a case under the Code, or\n     (3) to protect governmental matters that are made\n     confidential by statute or regulation. If an order is\n     entered under this rule without notice, any entity\n     affected thereby may move to vacate or modify the order,\n     and after a hearing on notice the court shall determine\n     the motion.\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f§ 107(b) -- create a framework for determining whether a paper\n\nfiled in a bankruptcy case is available to the public or subject to\n\nprotection.     Absent § 107, this question would be addressed by\n\nreference to the common law.     Because § 107 speaks directly to the\n\nquestion of public access, however, it supplants the common law for\n\npurposes   of   determining   public   access   to   papers   filed   in   a\n\nbankruptcy case.    See United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 534\n\n(1993) (\"In order to abrogate a common-law principle, the statute\n\nmust speak directly to the question addressed by the common law.\"\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). Therefore, \"issues concerning\n\npublic disclosure of documents in bankruptcy cases should be\n\nresolved under § 107,\" In re Phar-Mor, Inc., 191 B.R. 675, 679\n\n(Bankr. N.D. Ohio 1995), not under the common law.\n\n                                  III.\n\n           For purposes of this appeal, all parties agree that the\n\nExaminer's Report is a paper filed in a bankruptcy case and that\n\n§ 107 therefore governs the issue of public access to the Report.5\n\nSee 11 U.S.C. §§ 1106(a)(4)(A), (b) (requiring an examiner to file\n\na   statement of his investigation).     The parties also agree that a\n\nbankruptcy court has the power to protect a person seeking relief\n\n\n      5\n      At an earlier stage of these proceedings, the appellants\nargued that the Report was not a \"paper filed\" for purposes of\n§ 107(a) on the ground that the word \"file\" has a different meaning\nin § 107(a) than in 11 U.S.C. § 1106(a), the provision of the\nBankruptcy Code under which the Examiner was obligated to \"file\" a\nstatement of his investigation. The district court rejected this\ncontention, and the appellants do not pursue it on appeal.\n\n                                  -11-\n\fwith regard to a public record such as the Report only when the\n\nrecord falls within one of the exceptions set forth in § 107(b).\n\nThe issue on which they disagree is whether material in the Report\n\nfalls within the § 107(b)(2) exception for \"defamatory matter.\"6\n\nResolution of that disagreement requires us to consider the meaning\n\nof the word \"defamatory\" as it is used in § 107(b)(2).   Our review\n\nof this issue is de novo.   See In re Boston Reg'l Med. Ctr., Inc.,\n\n410 F.3d 100, 108 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"Like the district court, we\n\nreview de novo the bankruptcy court's conclusions of law.\").\n\nA.        The § 107(b)(2) exception\n\n          1. The Gittos' proposed reading of the exception\n\n          The Gittos contend that to qualify for protection under\n\n§ 107(b)(2), they need only identify material that would cause a\n\nreasonable person to alter his opinion of them -- namely, in their\n\nwords, material that is defamatory \"[u]nder the well-established\n\nmeaning of the term.\"       They maintain that \"[n]othing in the\n\nstatutory text states, or even suggests, that anything more is\n\nrequired.\"   The district court rejected this position, emphasizing\n\nthat it \"would sweep all manner of documents into its embrace\" in\n\n\n\n     6\n      The § 107(b)(2) exception applies to both \"scandalous\" and\n\"defamatory\" matter. On appeal, the appellants focus exclusively\non the \"defamatory\" prong of the exception. They do not suggest\nany definition for the \"scandalous\" prong, nor do they attempt to\ndemonstrate that the Report is scandalous within the meaning of\n§ 107(b)(2). Accordingly, we focus on the \"defamatory\" prong as\nwell.\n\n                                -12-\n\fcontravention of the § 107(a) presumption favoring public access in\n\nthe bankruptcy context.      We agree.\n\n            Although there is virtually no legislative history for\n\n§ 107, the plain language of § 107(a) evinces a clear congressional\n\nintent that papers filed in bankruptcy cases be available to the\n\npublic.    Many, if not the vast majority, of these papers will\n\ninclude    material   that   is   likely   to   affect   an   individual's\n\nreputation in the community.         Allegations of mismanagement or\n\nfraud, for example, might well cause a reasonable person to alter\n\nhis opinion of the individual against whom the allegations are\n\nmade.    As one bankruptcy court explained, it would be inconsistent\n\nwith the presumption of public access in § 107(a) to treat such\n\nallegations as defamatory within the meaning of § 107(b)(2):\n\n     The complaint . . . alleges that Defendants may have\n     received fraudulent transfers. . . .           Fraudulent\n     transfer actions . . . are common in bankruptcy practice,\n     and to grant Defendants' motion because of this\n     allegation could result in the sealing of pleadings in a\n     number of adversary proceedings. Congress, in enacting\n     section 107, did not contemplate such a result, and\n     intended that the sealing of pleadings would be the\n     exception rather than the rule.\n\nHope ex rel. Clark v. Pearson, 38 B.R. 423, 425 (Bankr. M.D. Ga.\n\n1984).\n\n            The Gittos concede that § 107(a) reflects a congressional\n\ndecision that filed papers are presumptively public and that such\n\nrecords are eligible for impoundment only under the specific\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fexceptions set forth in § 107(b).                    They dispute, however, the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that a broad reading of the exception\n\nwould   result      in    the    sweeping        curtailment      of    public         access.\n\nEmphasizing that § 107(b)(2) requires the court to protect a person\n\nbut does not indicate what form the protection should take, they\n\nargue   that    not      all    material        falling    within      the   §    107(b)(2)\n\nexception      will      necessarily       be    sealed.         Rather,     they       argue,\n\n§ 107(b)(2) merely triggers the court's duty to engage in a\n\nbalancing of the interests as required under the common law. Based\n\non this common law inquiry, the court would then use its discretion\n\nto take whatever protective measures justice required, whether it\n\nbe sealing or a more modest form of protection.\n\n            It is true that § 107(b)(2) speaks of protection in\n\ngeneral terms rather than of wholesale sealing, and that courts\n\nmust therefore exercise some discretion in determining what form of\n\nprotection to grant.              It does not follow, however, that the\n\nthreshold to qualify for protection under § 107(b)(2) is a low one.\n\nThe   Gittos    acknowledge        that     §    107(a)    reflects      a    legislative\n\ndecision that papers filed in a bankruptcy case are public records.\n\nThe reading of § 107(b)(2) that the Gittos propose, i.e., that any\n\nmaterial    tending       to    harm   a    person's      reputation         triggers      the\n\nexception, would significantly curtail the public's access to these\n\nrecords.     Once an interested party identifies material that is\n\nscandalous     or     defamatory,      the       court    must    protect        the    party.\n\n\n                                           -14-\n\fAlthough the protection may stop short of sealing the entire\n\ndocument containing the defamatory material, any form of protection\n\nwill    limit      the   information    available         to   the    public.     The\n\ninterpretation of § 107(b)(2) advanced by the Gittos therefore\n\nremains problematic despite the seal/protect distinction that they\n\nhighlight.\n\n               Moreover, there is no support for the Gittos' argument\n\nthat § 107(b)(2) is merely a trigger for the traditional common law\n\nanalysis regarding public disclosure.                The common law requires the\n\ncourt to determine whether the document at issue is a \"judicial\n\nrecord\" subject to the presumption of public access, and, if so, to\n\n\"balance[] the public interest in the information against privacy\n\ninterests.\"        In re Boston Herald, 321 F.3d at 190.                 Section 107\n\ndisplaces this approach entirely.              First, it dispenses with the\n\nneed to determine whether the document at issue is a \"judicial\n\nrecord\"       by   clarifying   that,    in    the    bankruptcy       context,   the\n\npresumption of public access applies to any paper filed in a\n\nbankruptcy case, not only the narrower category of papers that\n\nwould be considered judicial records under the common law. See id.\n\nat 180 (for purposes of the common law presumption, \"[n]ot all\n\ndocuments filed with a court are considered judicial documents\"\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted); Standard Fin. Mgmt. Corp., 830\n\nF.2d at 412-13 (\"The presumption that the public has a right to see\n\nand    copy    judicial    records   attaches        to   those      documents   which\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fproperly come before the court in the course of an adjudicatory\n\nproceeding and which are relevant to the adjudication.\"). Once the\n\npresumption of public access attaches under § 107(a), the next step\n\nin the inquiry is not to engage in a balancing of the equities, as\n\nrequired by the common law, but rather to determine whether the\n\nmaterial    at   issue    falls      within     a    specific         exception       to    the\n\npresumption      --    namely,   into    one    of       the    §    107(b)       categories.\n\nFinally,    if   material       does    come    within         one    of    the    statutory\n\nexceptions to public access, § 107 requires a court to act at the\n\nrequest of an interested party -- and permits a court to act sua\n\nsponte -- to protect the affected party.                       In short, § 107 speaks\n\ndirectly to the issues regarding disclosure that are addressed by\n\nthe common law analysis; its framework is not merely a prelude to\n\nthe common law analysis.          See Phar-Mor, 191 B.R. at 679 (\"In other\n\nareas of the law, courts have relied on showings of 'compelling\n\nreasons,' or balancing the interests of privacy and public right to\n\nknow, when reviewing a request for judicial non-disclosure.                                 The\n\nmandatory      language    of    §     107(b)       negates         the    need    for     such\n\ninquiries.\" (citation omitted)).\n\n            In a final effort to defend their position, the Gittos\n\nassert that a reading of § 107(b)(2) that does not include a common\n\nlaw balancing of the equities would impermissibly infringe on the\n\ncourts' traditional supervisory authority over their own records\n\nand   files,     see    Nixon,    435    U.S.       at    598,       by    limiting      their\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fdiscretion.    Such a reading, the Gittos argue, \"ignores the well-\n\nestablished principle that, where long-standing inherent powers of\n\na court are concerned, in the absence of 'clear and unmistakable'\n\ncongressional intent to restrict them, statutes should be construed\n\nso as to preserve the district court's usual role.\"\n\n            As we have already discussed, § 107 limits the discretion\n\nof courts regarding public access to papers filed in a bankruptcy\n\ncase by providing that all papers filed are public records (and\n\ntherefore   not   subject   to    protective    orders)     unless      material\n\ncontained therein falls within one of the statutory exceptions, in\n\nwhich case the court \"shall,\" on request of a party in interest, or\n\n\"may,\" on its own motion, protect the affected party.                      This\n\narrangement   reflects   Congress's        intent    to   cabin   the   courts'\n\nauthority over their records and files with regard to public access\n\nissues in bankruptcy cases.          Section 107 is therefore readily\n\ndistinguishable from the statute we considered in In re Atlantic\n\nPipe Corp., 304 F.3d 135 (1st Cir. 2002), the case on which the\n\nGittos' argument relies.         In Atlantic Pipe Corp., the issue was\n\nwhether the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998 (\"ADR Act\")\n\nrestricted \"the district courts' authority to engage in the case-\n\nby-case deployment of ADR procedures.\"              Id. at 142.   Emphasizing\n\nthat \"Congress may cabin the district courts' inherent powers [only\n\nif] its intention to do so [is] clear and unmistakable,\" we\n\nconcluded that nothing in the ADR Act, which required judicial\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fdistricts    to   adopt   some    form   of    ADR   procedures,      could    be\n\ninterpreted as stripping district court judges of their inherent\n\npower to require mediation.       Id.    The statutory language of § 107,\n\nby contrast, evinces a \"clear and unmistakable\" intent to cabin the\n\ninherent supervisory authority of district courts over their own\n\nrecords and files when it comes to issues of public access to\n\npapers filed in a bankruptcy case.               We therefore reject the\n\ninterpretation of § 107(b)(2) advanced by the Gittos.7\n\n            2. Our reading of the exception\n\n            Papers filed in the bankruptcy court do not fall within\n\nthe   §   107(b)(2)   exception    merely     because   they   would    have    a\n\ndetrimental impact on an interested party's reputation. Rather, as\n\nboth the bankruptcy court and the district court determined, the\n\nstatute    requires   something    more.      The    exact   nature    of    this\n\nadditional showing is not apparent, however, from the face of the\n\nstatute nor from the legislative history.            See Bodoh & Morgan, 24\n\nHastings Const. L.Q. at 89 (\"Although the class of persons covered\n\nby subsection 107(b)(2) is well defined, the type of materials\n\nconstituting scandalous or defamatory matter is not.\").                     It is\n\n\n\n\n      7\n      In light of this conclusion, we also reject the Gittos'\ncontention that the bankruptcy court erred in failing to \"make the\ncareful balance of the interests required by the common law.\"\nMoreover, the Gittos' arguments regarding the weight to be\nattributed to different interests under the common law analysis are\ninapposite.\n\n                                    -18-\n\ftherefore left to the courts to determine the specific contours of\n\nthe exception.\n\n          a. Untruth vs. potential untruth\n\n          Although the bankruptcy court did not explicitly state a\n\ntest for determining whether material falls within § 107(b)(2), it\n\nconcluded that a party seeking to invoke the exception must \"come\n\nforward with the particular facts that demonstrate the material at\n\nissue is scandalous or defamatory.\"      In denying all of the motions\n\nfor protection, the court explained that \"[i]n almost all instances\n\nthere was no proof\" and noted that some movants \"urged that the\n\nCourt not divulge to the public information about them even though\n\nthey do not allege that [the] information . . . is factually\n\ninaccurate.\"     Based   on   these   statements,   the   district   court\n\ndescribed the bankruptcy court as holding that \"appellants, in\n\norder to enjoy the protection of § 107(b)(2), must demonstrate that\n\nmaterial in the Report is untruthful.\"\n\n          The bankruptcy court's test is largely unworkable. While\n\nsome parties seeking protection under § 107(b)(2) may be able to\n\ndemonstrate untruthfulness solely on the basis of the papers filed\n\nwith the court, such situations will be rare.       More often than not,\n\nstatements in a court filing are disputed. It would be unrealistic\n\nto require the bankruptcy court to resolve these factual disputes\n\nat a preliminary stage of the proceedings.           The untruthfulness\n\nrequirement would add an enormous burden to the bankruptcy courts'\n\n                                  -19-\n\falready heavy docket by turning motions for protection under\n\n§   107(b)(2)   into   an   occasion   for   mini-trials.   We   therefore\n\nemphasize that although a bankruptcy court may grant protection\n\nunder § 107(b)(2) based on a showing of untruthfulness, protection\n\non this basis is available only in the rare case where the\n\nuntruthfulness is readily apparent. Bankruptcy courts are under no\n\nobligation to resolve questions of truthfulness presented by a\n\n§ 107(b)(2) motion where doing so would require discovery or\n\nadditional hearings, or would be otherwise burdensome.\n\n           In most cases, a party filing a motion for protection\n\nunder § 107(b)(2) will only be able to show that the material at\n\nissue is potentially untrue.      Potentially untrue material may also\n\nimplicate § 107(b)(2). However, given the relative ease of showing\n\npotential untruthfulness, such a showing, standing alone, cannot be\n\nenough to trigger the exception. To hold otherwise would undermine\n\nthe policy of public access codified in § 107(a).           Therefore, we\n\nhold that a party may seek protection under § 107(b)(2) based on\n\npotentially untrue information that would alter his reputation in\n\nthe eyes of a reasonable person. To obtain protection, however, an\n\nadditional showing must be made.\n\n           b. The additional showing\n\n           The district court looked to the opinions of other courts\n\napplying § 107(b)(2) and to analogs of § 107(b)(2) to determine\n\nunder what circumstances allegedly defamatory material that is\n\n                                   -20-\n\fpotentially    untrue      may    trigger   protection   under     §   107(b)(2).\n\nFinding this to be a sensible approach in dealing with a matter of\n\nfirst impression, we do the same.\n\n            Some courts faced with interpreting § 107(b)(2) have\n\nnoted the similarity between that subsection and Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(f), which provides that \"the court may order stricken from any\n\npleading    any    .   .   .     redundant,    immaterial,      impertinent,   or\n\nscandalous matter.\"        See Phar-Mor, 191 B.R. at 678 (tracing \"[t]he\n\nauthority     to   protect       persons    from   scandalous    or    defamatory\n\nmaterial\" to Rule 26 of the Rules of Practice for the Courts of\n\nEquity of the United States, a precursor to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f)).\n\nUnder Rule 12(f),\n\n     scandalous allegations . . . will be stricken from the\n     pleadings in order to purge the court's files and protect\n     the subject of the allegations. But there are several\n     limitations on the court's willingness to strike\n     scandalous allegations. For example, it is not enough\n     that the matter offends the sensibilities of the\n     objecting party if the challenged allegations describe\n     acts or events that are relevant to the action. As a\n     result, courts have permitted allegations to remain in\n     the pleadings when they supported and were relevant to a\n     claim for punitive damages.\n\nHope, 38 B.R. at 424-25 (quoting 5 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R.\n\nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1382 (3d ed. 2004)).\n\n            The Phar-Mor court concluded that Rule 12(f) and § 107(b)\n\nshare a common premise: \"A person within the courts' jurisdiction\n\nshould not be subjected to scandalous or defamatory material\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\fsubmitted under the guise of a properly pleaded court document.\"\n\n191 B.R. at 678-79.      Exceptions to the common law presumption of\n\npublic access appear to share the same premise.        As the Supreme\n\nCourt emphasized in Nixon, under the common law, public access to\n\ncourt records and files \"has been denied where court files might\n\nhave become a vehicle for improper purposes.\"        435 U.S. at 598.\n\nThe Court offered several examples of such \"improper purposes,\"\n\nincluding gratifying public spite, promoting public scandal, and\n\nusing court files as \"reservoirs of libelous statements for press\n\nconsumption.\"     Id.   As is the case under Rule 12(f), these bases\n\nfor removing material from the public eye focus not just on the\n\nimpact of the material on a person's reputation, but also on the\n\nrole of the material in the court records.      There is no reason to\n\nbelieve that the role of the material is any less central to the\n\nprotection inquiry under § 107(b)(2) than it is under the Federal\n\nRules of Civil Procedure or the common law.\n\n           The case law interpreting and applying § 107(b)(2) also\n\nsupports the context-sensitive inquiry that we have just described.\n\nIn re Commodore Corp., 70 B.R. 543 (Bankr. N.D. Ind. 1987), for\n\nexample, involved a motion to strike portions of a brief that\n\nclaimed that Lord, Bissell & Brook (\"L B & B\"), the court-approved\n\ncounsel for the debtor, was not disinterested and therefore was not\n\nentitled to compensation and reimbursement of expenses.           LB&B\n\nasserted   that    certain   statements   in   the   brief,   including\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\fallegations that it was \"in [the] pocket\" of and \"a front for\"\n\nanother company, were scandalous or defamatory within the meaning\n\nof § 107(b)(2).       70 B.R. at 545 n.3 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).   The bankruptcy court denied the motion, in part on the\n\nground that \"the statements in question were made in support of\n\n[the objector's] allegations that L B & B was not disinterested.\"\n\nId. at 546.     In other words, the court viewed the statements'\n\nrelevance to a bona fide legal claim as pertinent to the §\n\n107(b)(2) inquiry.\n\n            The decision by the district court in In re Continental\n\nAirlines, 150 B.R. 334 (D. Del. 1993) also suggests that the\n\npurpose of including material in a paper filed with the court\n\nshould inform the inquiry into whether that material falls within\n\nthe § 107(b)(2) exception.         Continental Airlines involved the\n\nsealing of reports generated by a fee-reviewer pursuant to 11\n\nU.S.C. § 330(a)(1)(A), which allows the court to award \"reasonable\n\ncompensation    for    actual,   necessary    services    rendered\"   in    a\n\nbankruptcy case.      The bankruptcy court ordered that the reports be\n\nsealed pursuant to § 107(b)(2).           The district court reversed,\n\nconcluding that there was no evidence that the fee-reviewer's\n\nopinions and conclusions were \"even potentially defamatory in\n\nnature.\"    Id. at 340.    The court explained that \"[i]f such legal\n\nrecommendations    and    assertions,     required   to   be   rendered    by\n\nstatutory and caselaw authority, were sealed based on nothing more\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fthan   the    mere    possibility   that    they    contain    'defamatory'\n\nassertions, the judicial system would be thwarted in its mandated\n\nresponsibility to supervise litigation expenses.\"                Id.    This\n\nreasoning treats the fact that the fee-reviewer's reports were\n\nstatutorily-mandated as relevant to the determination that they\n\nwere not scandalous or defamatory.\n\n             The   Phar-Mor   decision   offers    further   support   for   a\n\nreading of § 107(b)(2) that is sensitive to the purpose of the\n\nstatements at issue and the context in which they are made.            Phar-\n\nMor involved a complaint that alleged wrongdoing by a business\n\nentity with a general partner and several limited partners.              See\n\n191 B.R. at 677-78.      Only the limited partners were named in the\n\ncomplaint because the general partner was protected by an automatic\n\nstay, see 11 U.S.C. § 362, but the limited partners were not.            See\n\n191 B.R. at 677.     The limited partners sought to have the complaint\n\nsealed, arguing that the allegations of wrongdoing were really\n\ndirected only at the general partner and that they had been named\n\nin the complaint purely for strategic reasons, including \"a need to\n\npreserve some cause of action or be barred by a statute of\n\nlimitations, a desire to promote settlement . . . [,] and the\n\ninability to prosecute the real party in interest, [the general\n\npartner], due to the protection of the automatic stay in his\n\nChapter 11 case.\"        Id. at 680.       The bankruptcy court agreed,\n\nholding that \"a reasonable person would alter [his] opinion of\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\fDefendants based on a reading of the complaint, because it contains\n\nallegations of wrongdoing against the Defendants for, in essence,\n\nthe acts of [the general partner], without an explanation of the\n\nunderlying rationale for filing the complaint in this fashion.\"\n\nId. The court's references to the strategic reasons for filing the\n\ncomplaint and the complaint's resulting propensity to mislead the\n\npublic indicate that it considered the plaintiffs' improper reasons\n\nfor filing the complaint relevant to its determination that the\n\nstatements at issue were scandalous or defamatory.\n\n           In short, both the case law and the interpretation of\n\nsources   analogous    to   §   107(b)(2)   support    a   context-sensitive\n\napproach to the exception.        We agree with the district court that\n\n\"to implicate § 107(b)(2) in the context of potentially untrue\n\nmaterial, the information would also have to be irrelevant [or]\n\nincluded for improper ends.\" Under this reading of § 107(b)(2), as\n\nCongress intended, protection of papers filed in a bankruptcy case\n\nwill be \"the exception rather than the rule.\"              Hope, 38 B.R. at\n\n425.\n\n           The district court alluded to one other category of\n\npotentially   untrue    material    that    may    implicate   §   107(b)(2):\n\nmaterial that is \"so misleading in context as to be deemed facially\n\ninaccurate.\" The court appears to have derived this category, like\n\nthe improper ends test, from Phar-Mor.            See 191 B.R. at 680.   The\n\ndistrict court did not explain, however, what it means for material\n\n                                    -25-\n\fto be \"so misleading in context as to be facially inaccurate,\" nor\n\ndid    it   explicitly      consider         the     material    in    the   Report     with\n\nreference to this standard. Having pondered this language for some\n\ntime, we think its meaning is most akin to the test adopted by the\n\nbankruptcy court.           Alternatively, it may just be another way of\n\nsaying that material is potentially untrue.                      In any event, unlike\n\nthe other categories set forth in the district court's thoughtful\n\nanalysis, we find the category \"so misleading in context as to be\n\nfacially inaccurate\" unhelpful.                    Even the material at issue in\n\nPhar-Mor, the apparent source of the \"so misleading in context\"\n\nstandard, could also be described as triggering the § 107(b)(2)\n\nexception         based    on     its        untruthfulness       or     its    potential\n\nuntruthfulness and its inclusion in the complaint for an improper\n\nend.        Hence,   we    will    not       include    this    category       within   the\n\nadditional showing required by § 107(b)(2) for material that is\n\npotentially untrue.\n\n              We therefore conclude that material that would cause a\n\nreasonable person to alter his opinion of an interested party\n\ntriggers the protections of § 107(b)(2) based on a showing that\n\neither      (1)    the    material      is    untrue,    or     (2)    the   material    is\n\npotentially untrue and irrelevant or included within a bankruptcy\n\nfiling for an improper end.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -26-\n\fB.           Application of § 107(b)(2)\n\n             Both    the   bankruptcy       court   and   the    district    court\n\nconcluded that the material in the Report did not fall within the\n\n§ 107(b)(2) exception, and therefore that the Report had to be\n\npublicly     accessible.         Although    the    district    court    made   its\n\ndetermination based on a standard similar to the one set forth in\n\nthis opinion, the bankruptcy court did not.                    Specifically, the\n\nbankruptcy     court       did    not    recognize     that,     under      certain\n\ncircumstances, material that is potentially untrue, in addition to\n\nmaterial that a court has determined to be untrue, can trigger the\n\nprotections of § 107(b)(2).             The Gittos assert that if both they\n\nand the bankruptcy court misapprehended the standard for applying\n\n§ 107(b)(2), they are \"entitled, at the least, to the opportunity\n\nto   argue   for     impoundment    to    the   Bankruptcy      Court   under   the\n\nappropriate standard [and] to point out particular problems with\n\nthe Report.\"        As the Gittos point out, we have remanded at least\n\nonce in the past to allow the court of first instance to \"evaluate\n\nthe plaintiffs' complaints in light of the standard [announced on\n\nappeal].\" Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, 889 F.2d 1209, 1223\n\n(1st Cir. 1989) (en banc).\n\n             We conclude, however, that there is no need for a remand\n\nin this case because \"application of the correct legal standard\n\ncould lead to only one conclusion.\"             Ward v. Comm'r, 211 F.3d 652,\n\n656 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting Schaal v. Apfel, 134 F.3d 496, 504 (2d\n\n                                         -27-\n\fCir. 1998)); see also In re R & R Assocs. of Hampton, 402 F.3d 257,\n\n270   (1st    Cir.   2005)   (explaining     that   \"[w]e     have   considered\n\nremanding the case to the district and bankruptcy courts for\n\nfurther factfinding . . . but see no need to impose . . . on the\n\ncourts'      time\"   because,   based   on   the    record,   \"no    reasonable\n\nfactfinder\" could disagree as to the result).                   At most, the\n\nmaterial in the Report is potentially untrue.            Potentially untrue\n\nstatements are defamatory within the meaning of § 107(b)(2) only if\n\nthey are also irrelevant or included for improper ends.                     The\n\ncontents of the Report do not meet this standard.\n\n              1. Untruthfulness\n\n              The bankruptcy court concluded that the parties seeking\n\nprotection under § 107(b)(2) had not provided proof that any of the\n\nmaterial in the Report is inaccurate.          The Gittos do not directly\n\nchallenge that ruling on appeal.         Instead, as will usually happen\n\nin these § 107(b)(2) cases, the Gittos' criticism demonstrates only\n\nthat some material in the Report is potentially untrue.                     For\n\nexample, the Gittos assert that \"[o]ne of the greatest problems\n\nwith the Report is the way the Examiner attributes wrongdoing to\n\nthe 'Gitto [P]rincipals,' a group including more than Charles and\n\nGarry Gitto, while conceding that he cannot 'allocate [blame]\n\nprecisely among the three [principals].'\" The Gittos also complain\n\nthat \"some of the harshest allegations against [them] are highly\n\nmisleading in that there is a sharp disconnect between the evidence\n\n                                    -28-\n\fcollected by the Examiner and the sweeping conclusions he is\n\nwilling to advance.\"         These contentions do not establish that the\n\nReport is untrue, nor would they obligate a bankruptcy court to\n\nengage in additional factfinding on the issue.                They demonstrate\n\nonly that material in the Report may later turn out to be untrue,\n\na point which is beyond dispute in light of the acknowledgment in\n\nthe Report that \"[c]ontinued investigation may lead to evidence\n\nwhich supports or contradicts . . . statements [herein].\"                Given\n\nthis caveat and the preliminary nature of the Report, we will\n\nassume,   as   did    the    district   court,   that   the   Report   includes\n\npotentially untrue material that would cause a reasonable person to\n\nalter his opinion of the Gittos.\n\n           2. Irrelevance or inclusion for improper ends\n\n           Material that is potentially untrue and that would cause\n\na reasonable person to alter his opinion of an interested party\n\ntriggers the protections of § 107(b)(2) if it is also irrelevant to\n\nthe case in which it was filed or if it is included within a filing\n\nfor improper ends. Neither of those circumstances is present here.\n\n           a. Irrelevance\n\n           The bankruptcy court appointed the Examiner pursuant to\n\n11 U.S.C. § 1104(c), which contemplates an examiner \"conduct[ing]\n\nsuch an investigation of the debtor as is appropriate, including an\n\ninvestigation        of     any   allegations     of    fraud,     dishonesty,\n\n\n\n                                        -29-\n\fincompetence, misconduct, mismanagement, or irregularity in the\n\nmanagement of the affairs of the debtor of or by current or former\n\nmanagement of the debtor.\"   Over the three months following his\n\nappointment, the Examiner engaged in an extensive investigation of\n\npre-petition irregularities and misconduct.   As the Examiner -- an\n\nappellee in this case -- relates in his brief, he \"interviewed\n\ndozens of witnesses, reviewed thousands of pages of documents, and\n\nprepared a Report running more than 150 pages.\"       See 11 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1106(a)(4)(A) (requiring the Examiner to file a statement of his\n\ninvestigation).\n\n          The Report catalogs precisely the types of allegations\n\ndescribed in 11 U.S.C. § 1104(c) -- namely, \"irregularit[ies] in\n\nthe management of the affairs of the debtor [Gitto Global] of or by\n\n. . . former management of the debtor.\"8        Id.    While these\n\nallegations may affect the reputations of those at whom they are\n\ndirected, that possibility, standing alone, does not render them\n\ndefamatory within the meaning of § 107(b)(2).   The information in\n\nthe Report is directly relevant to the Report's purpose, which the\n\nExaminer describes in his brief as creating \"a base of information\n\nsufficient [for creditors] to assess whether they may have claims\n\nagainst management, shareholders, or others who have worked with\n\n\n     8\n      All of Gitto Global's officers and directors resigned and\nwere replaced by an independent restructuring officer immediately\nbefore the company filed for bankruptcy. All of the pre-petition\nactivity described in the Report therefore involves only former\nmanagement.\n\n                               -30-\n\fthe corporation.\"    The fact that the Report will be used by\n\ncreditors and shareholders to assess their claims, rather than by\n\nthe court to adjudicate a dispute, does not make the material\n\nincluded therein any less relevant to the bankruptcy case.     The\n\nrelevancy of the material in the Report is similarly unaffected by\n\nthe fact that the Report discusses pre-petition conduct, as opposed\n\nto ongoing conduct. As the district court recognized, \"the avenues\n\na debtor may pursue to recover for arguably improper activity by\n\nits former officers and their associates remains of concern to the\n\nmission of the bankruptcy court.\"     (Emphasis added.)\n\n          b. Improper ends\n\n          The question of whether the potentially untrue material\n\nwas included for an improper end is also no help to the Gittos'\n\n§ 107(b)(2) claim.   The Examiner's disinterested status in this\n\ncase is not in question, nor is there any indication whatsoever\n\nthat he drafted the Report in bad faith or otherwise included the\n\nallegedly defamatory material for an improper purpose.    Cf. Phar-\n\nMor, 191 B.R. at 679-80 (concluding that a complaint that was filed\n\nfor \"strategic reasons which would not be apparent[] on its face\"\n\nfell within the § 107(b)(2) exception).\n\n          The Gittos therefore cannot show that potentially untrue\n\nmaterial in the Report is either irrelevant or included for an\n\n\n\n\n                               -31-\n\fimproper end.       Therefore, the bankruptcy court did not err in\n\ndenying their request for protection under § 107(b)(2).9\n\n                                        IV.\n\n              To qualify for protection under the § 107(b)(2) exception\n\nfor defamatory material, an interested party must show (1) that the\n\nmaterial at issue would alter his reputation in the eyes of a\n\nreasonable person, and (2) that the material is untrue or that it\n\nis potentially untrue and irrelevant or included for an improper\n\nend.       The Gittos cannot make such a showing with regard to the\n\nReport.      Therefore, upon issuance of the mandate, and once the\n\nExaminer deletes all bank account numbers included in the Report\n\nand    its   exhibits   pursuant   to    the   unchallenged   ruling   of   the\n\n\n\n\n       9\n      In concluding that there is a right of public access to the\nReport, we also reject the Gittos' argument that public disclosure\nof the Report will \"create a genuine risk\" of harm to their Sixth\nAmendment right to trial by an impartial jury. Although the Gittos\nemphasize that a federal grand jury is investigating \"the same\nmatters investigated by the Examiner,\" they have not indicated that\nany criminal charges have been filed in connection with the grand\njury's investigation, much less that a trial is imminent. Concerns\nthat disclosure of the Report would taint a jury pool are therefore\nentirely speculative. Moreover, there are many ways to protect a\ncriminal defendant's right to a fair trial without enjoining the\npublic disclosure of information. For example, a court may use the\nvoir dire process to \"identify those jurors whose prior knowledge\nof the case would disable them from rendering an impartial\nverdict,\" Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. 1, 15\n(1986), or transfer the proceeding to a different venue, see Fed.\nR. Crim. P. 21(a). In light of these alternatives and the highly\nspeculative nature of the Gittos claim, the Sixth Amendment does\nnot require sealing or redaction of the Report.\n\n                                    -32-\n\fbankruptcy   court   regarding   the    redaction   of   confidential\n\ninformation, the Report shall be filed publicly.\n\n          So ordered.

The bankruptcy court rejected this contention, finding that the appellants had not demonstrated that the material at issue was scandalous or defamatory and that it therefore must be publicly available under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 107(a).

(\"Gitto Global\"), a plastics manufacturer in Lunenberg, Massachusetts, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 24, 2004 amid allegations of financial distress and accounting irregularities. Shortly thereafter, the bankruptcy court appointed an Examiner to \"begin an investigation into the existence of any pre[-]petition fraud, dishonesty, incompetence, misconduct, mismanagement, or irregularity in the management and business affairs of the Debtor.\" The Examiner was also instructed to \"file a statement with the Court ... reporting the preliminary or final findings of the Examiner, along with any recommendations of the Examiner for further investigation.\" The purpose of the investigation and the Report was to develop information for use in potential proceedings against Gitto Global.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 8, 2004, the Examiner filed a motion requesting that the court authorize him to submit the Report (which had not yet been filed) under seal and have it impounded pending a further order of the court. In an order dated December 9, 2004, the court allowed the motion, subject to a requirement that any party in interest be allowed to file a motion seeking release of the Report. On January 5, 2005, after receiving several motions seeking access to the Report upon its filing, the court modified its December 9 order to require that within ten days of filing the Report, the Examiner \"provide each person named in the report ... with a copy of only that portion or portions of the report that relate to the individual.\" The modified order also invited motions from individuals seeking to seal or redact the report, as well as objections to motions to seal or redact. The Examiner filed his Report under seal on January 7, 2004 and served redacted copies on approximately 120 individuals pursuant to the court's January 5 order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among those who received redacted copies of the Report were appellant Gary Gitto, part-owner and former CEO of Gitto Global, and appellant Charles Gitto, who held himself out as chairman of Gitto Global and is Gary Gitto's father. The Gittos filed motions requesting that the Report remain under seal, as did approximately twenty-four other individuals. In their motions, the Gittos argued that there was no right of public access to the Report under either the common law or the First Amendment. Gary Gitto further argued that the Report contained scandalous and defamatory material within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 107(b)(2), and therefore that the usual presumption of public access under &#167; 107(a) did not apply. Appellees WT &amp; G and MediaNews, both news organizations, opposed the motions to seal. The appellees argued that there is a right of public access to the Report under the First Amendment, the common law, and &#167; 107(a), and that the appellants had not demonstrated that the Report contained defamatory matter for purposes of &#167; 107(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 9, 2005, after a hearing on the various motions, the bankruptcy court concluded in a memorandum that there was nothing scandalous or defamatory in the Report.

Absent &#167; 107, this question would be addressed by reference to the common law. Because &#167; 107 speaks directly to the question of public access, however, it supplants the common law for purposes of determining public access to papers filed in a bankruptcy case. <i>See United States v.

We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although there is virtually no legislative history for &#167; 107, the plain language of &#167; 107(a) evinces a clear congressional intent that papers filed in bankruptcy cases be available to the public. Many, if not the vast majority, of these papers will include material that is likely to affect an individual's reputation in the community. Allegations of mismanagement or fraud, for example, might well cause a reasonable person to alter his opinion of the individual against whom the allegations are made. As one bankruptcy court explained, it would be inconsistent with the presumption of public access in &#167; 107(a) to treat such allegations as defamatory within the meaning of &#167; 107(b)(2):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint ... alleges that Defendants may have received fraudulent transfers.... Fraudulent transfer actions ... are common in bankruptcy practice, and to grant Defendants' motion because of this allegation could result in the sealing of pleadings in a number of adversary proceedings. Congress, in enacting section 107, did not contemplate such a result, and intended that the sealing of pleadings would be the exception rather than the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Hope ex rel.

They dispute, however, the district court's conclusion that a broad reading of the exception would result in the sweeping curtailment of public access. Emphasizing that &#167; 107(b)(2) requires the court to protect a person but does not indicate what form the protection should take, they argue that not all material falling within the &#167; 107(b)(2) exception will necessarily be sealed. Rather, they argue, &#167; 107(b)(2) merely triggers the court's duty to engage in a balancing of the interests as required under the common law. Based on this common law inquiry, the court would then use its discretion to take whatever protective measures justice required, whether it be sealing or a more modest form of protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that &#167; 107(b)(2) speaks of protection in general terms rather than of wholesale sealing, and that courts must therefore exercise some discretion in determining what form of protection to grant. It does not follow, however, that the threshold to qualify for protection under &#167; 107(b)(2) is a low one. The Gittos acknowledge that &#167; 107(a) reflects a legislative decision that papers filed in a bankruptcy case are public records. The reading of &#167; 107(b)(2) that the Gittos propose, <i>i.e.,</i> that any material tending to harm a person's reputation triggers the exception, would significantly curtail the public's access to these records. Once an interested party identifies material that is scandalous or defamatory, the court must protect the party. Although the protection may stop short of sealing the entire document containing the defamatory material, any form of protection will limit the information available to the public. The interpretation of &#167; 107(b)(2) advanced by the Gittos therefore remains problematic despite the seal/protect distinction that they highlight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there is no support for the Gittos' argument that &#167; 107(b)(2) is merely a trigger for the traditional common law analysis regarding public disclosure. The common law requires the court to determine whether the document at issue is a \"judicial record\" subject to the presumption of public access, and, if so, to \"balance[ ] the public interest in the information against privacy interests.\" <i>In re Boston Herald,</i> 321 F.3d at 190. Section 107 displaces this approach entirely. First, it dispenses with the need to determine whether the document at issue is a \"judicial record\" by clarifying that, in the bankruptcy context, the presumption of public access applies to <i>any</i> paper filed in a bankruptcy case, not only the narrower category of papers that would be considered judicial records under the common law. <i>See id.</i> at 180 (for purposes of the common law presumption, \"[n]ot all documents filed with a court are considered judicial documents\") (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>Standard Fin. Mgmt. Corp.,</i> 830 F.2d at 412-13 (\"The presumption that the public has a right to see and copy judicial records attaches to those documents which properly come before the court in the course of an adjudicatory proceeding and which are relevant to the adjudication.\"). Once the presumption of public access attaches under &#167; 107(a), the next step in the inquiry is not to engage in a balancing of the equities, as required by the common law, but rather to determine whether the material at issue falls within a specific exception to the presumption &#8212; namely, into one of the &#167; 107(b) categories. Finally, if material does come within one of the statutory exceptions to public access, &#167; 107 requires a court to act at the request of an interested party &#8212; and permits a court to act <i>sua sponte</i> &#8212; to protect the affected party. In short, &#167; 107 speaks directly to the issues regarding disclosure that are addressed by the common law analysis; its framework is not merely a prelude to the common law analysis. <i>See Phar-Mor,</i> 191 B.R. at 679 (\"In other areas of the law, courts have relied on showings of `compelling reasons,' or balancing the interests of privacy and public right to know, when reviewing a request for judicial non-disclosure. The mandatory language of &#167; 107(b) negates the need for such inquiries.\" (citation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a final effort to defend their position, the Gittos assert that a reading of &#167; 107(b)(2) that does not include a common law balancing of the equities would impermissibly infringe on the courts' traditional supervisory authority over their own records and files, <i>see Nixon,</i> 435 U.S. at 598, 98 S.Ct. 1306, by limiting their discretion. Such a reading, the Gittos argue, \"ignores the well-established principle that, where long-standing inherent powers of a court are concerned, in the absence of `clear and unmistakable' congressional intent to restrict them, statutes should be construed so as to preserve the district court's usual role.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have already discussed, &#167; 107 limits the discretion of courts regarding public access to papers filed in a bankruptcy case by providing that all papers filed are public records (and therefore not subject to protective orders) unless material contained therein falls within one of the statutory exceptions, in which case the court \"shall,\" on request of a party in interest, or \"may,\" on its own motion, protect the affected party. This arrangement reflects Congress's intent to cabin the courts' authority over their records and files with regard to public access issues in bankruptcy cases. Section 107 is therefore readily distinguishable from the statute we considered in <i>In re Atlantic Pipe Corp.,</i> 304 F.3d 135 (1st Cir.2002), the case on which the Gittos' argument relies. In <i>Atlantic Pipe Corp.,</i> the issue was whether the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998 (\"ADR Act\") restricted \"the district courts' authority to engage in the case-by-case deployment of ADR procedures.\" <i>Id.</i> at 142. Emphasizing that \"Congress may cabin the district courts' inherent powers [only if] its intention to do so [is] clear and unmistakable,\" we concluded that nothing in the ADR Act, which required judicial districts to adopt some form of ADR procedures, could be interpreted as stripping district court judges of their inherent power to require mediation. <i>Id.</i> The statutory language of &#167; 107, by contrast, evinces a \"clear and unmistakable\" intent to cabin the inherent supervisory authority of district courts over their own records and files when it comes to issues of public access to papers filed in a bankruptcy case. We therefore reject the interpretation of &#167; 107(b)(2) advanced by the Gittos.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Our reading of the exception</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Papers filed in the bankruptcy court do not fall within the &#167; 107(b)(2) exception merely because they would have a detrimental impact on an interested party's reputation. Rather, as both the bankruptcy court and the district court determined, the statute requires something more. The exact nature of this additional showing is not apparent, however, from the face of the statute nor from the legislative history. <i>See</i> Bodoh &amp; Morgan, 24 Hastings Const. L.Q. at 89 (\"Although the class of persons covered by subsection 107(b)(2) is well defined, the type of materials constituting scandalous or defamatory matter is not.\"). It is therefore left to the courts to determine the specific contours of the exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Untruth vs. potential untruth</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the bankruptcy court did not explicitly state a test for determining whether material falls within &#167; 107(b)(2), it concluded that a party seeking to invoke the exception must \"come forward with the particular facts that demonstrate the material at issue is scandalous or defamatory.\" In denying all of the motions for protection, the court explained that \"[i]n almost all instances there was no proof\" and noted that some movants \"urged that the Court not divulge to the public information about them even though they do not allege that [the] information ... is factually inaccurate.\" Based on these statements, the district court described the bankruptcy court as holding that \"appellants, in order to enjoy the protection of &#167; 107(b)(2), must demonstrate that material in the Report is untruthful.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court's test is largely unworkable. While some parties seeking protection under &#167; 107(b)(2) may be able to demonstrate untruthfulness solely on the basis of the papers filed with the court, such situations will be rare. More often than not, statements in a court filing are disputed. It would be unrealistic to require the bankruptcy court to resolve these factual disputes at a preliminary stage of the proceedings. The untruthfulness requirement would add an enormous burden to the bankruptcy courts' already heavy docket by turning motions for protection under &#167; 107(b)(2) into an occasion for mini-trials. We therefore emphasize that although a bankruptcy court <i>may</i> grant protection under &#167; 107(b)(2) based on a showing of untruthfulness, protection on this basis is available only in the rare case where the untruthfulness is readily apparent. Bankruptcy courts are under no obligation to resolve questions of truthfulness presented by a &#167; 107(b)(2) motion where doing so would require discovery or additional hearings, or would be otherwise burdensome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In most cases, a party filing a motion for protection under &#167; 107(b)(2) will only be able to show that the material at issue is <i>potentially</i> untrue. Potentially untrue material may also implicate &#167; 107(b)(2). However, given the relative ease of showing potential untruthfulness, such a showing, standing alone, cannot be enough to trigger the exception. To hold otherwise would undermine the policy of public access codified in &#167; 107(a). Therefore, we hold that a party may seek protection under &#167; 107(b)(2) based on <i>potentially</i> untrue information that would alter his reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person. To obtain protection, however, an additional showing must be made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. The additional showing</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court looked to the opinions of other courts applying &#167; 107(b)(2) and to analogs of &#167; 107(b)(2) to determine under what circumstances allegedly defamatory material that is potentially untrue may trigger protection under &#167; 107(b)(2). Finding this to be a sensible approach in dealing with a matter of first impression, we do the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some courts faced with interpreting &#167; 107(b)(2) have noted the similarity between that subsection and Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(f), which provides that \"the court may order stricken from any pleading any ... redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\" <i>See Phar-Mor,</i> 191 B.R. at 678 (tracing \"[t]he authority to protect persons from scandalous or defamatory material\" to Rule 26 of the Rules of Practice for the Courts of Equity of the United States, a precursor to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(f)). Under Rule 12(f),</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">scandalous allegations ... will be stricken from the pleadings in order to purge the court's files and protect the subject of the allegations. But there are several limitations on the court's willingness to strike scandalous allegations. For example, it is not enough that the matter offends the sensibilities of the objecting party if the challenged allegations describe acts or events that are relevant to the action. As a result, courts have permitted allegations to remain in the pleadings when they supported and were relevant to a claim for punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Hope,</i> 38 B.R. at 424-25 (quoting 5 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R.

Exceptions to the common law presumption of public access appear to share the same premise. As the Supreme Court emphasized in <i>Nixon,</i> under the common law, public access to court records and files \"has been denied where court files might have become a vehicle for improper purposes.\" 435 U.S. at 598, 98 S.Ct. 1306. The Court offered several examples of such \"improper purposes,\" including gratifying public spite, promoting public scandal, and using court files as \"reservoirs of libelous statements for press consumption.\" <i>Id.</i> As is the case under Rule 12(f), these bases for removing material from the public eye focus not just on the impact of the material on a person's reputation, but also on the role of the material in the court records. There is no reason to believe that the role of the material is any less central to the protection inquiry under &#167; 107(b)(2) than it is under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or the common law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law interpreting and applying &#167; 107(b)(2) also supports the context-sensitive inquiry that we have just described. <i>In re Commodore Corp.,</i> 70 B.R. 543 (Bankr.N.D.Ind.1987), for example, involved a motion to strike portions of a brief that claimed that Lord, Bissell &amp; Brook (\"L B &amp; B\"), the court-approved counsel for the debtor, was not disinterested and therefore was not entitled to compensation and reimbursement of expenses. LB &amp; B asserted that certain statements in the brief, including allegations that it was \"in [the] pocket\" of and \"a front for\" another company, were scandalous or defamatory within the meaning of &#167; 107(b)(2). 70 B.R. at 545 n. 3 (internal quotation marks omitted). The bankruptcy court denied the motion, in part on the ground that \"the statements in question were made in support of [the objector's] allegations that L B &amp; B was not disinterested.\" <i>Id.</i> at 546. In other words, the court viewed the statements' relevance to a bona fide legal claim as pertinent to the &#167; 107(b)(2) inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision by the district court in <i>In re Continental Airlines,</i> 150 B.R. 334 (D.Del.1993) also suggests that the purpose of including material in a paper filed with the court should inform the inquiry into whether that material falls within the &#167; 107(b)(2) exception. <i>Continental Airlines</i> involved the sealing of reports generated by a fee-reviewer pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#167; 330(a)(1)(A), which allows the court to award \"reasonable compensation for actual, necessary services rendered\" in a bankruptcy case. The bankruptcy court ordered that the reports be sealed pursuant to &#167; 107(b)(2). The district court reversed, concluding that there was no evidence that the fee-reviewer's opinions and conclusions were \"even potentially defamatory in nature.\" <i>Id.</i> at 340. The court explained that \"[i]f such legal recommendations and assertions, required to be rendered by statutory and caselaw authority, were sealed based on nothing more than the mere possibility that they contain `defamatory' assertions, the judicial system would be thwarted in its mandated responsibility to supervise litigation expenses.\" <i>Id.</i> This reasoning treats the fact that the fee-reviewer's reports were statutorily-mandated as relevant to the determination that they were not scandalous or defamatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Phar-Mor</i> decision offers further support for a reading of &#167; 107(b)(2) that is sensitive to the purpose of the statements at issue and the context in which they are made. <i>Phar-Mor</i> involved a complaint that alleged wrongdoing by a business entity with a general partner and several limited partners. <i>See</i> 191 B.R. at 677-78. Only the limited partners were named in the complaint because the general partner was protected by an automatic stay, <i>see</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362, but the limited partners were not. <i>See</i> 191 B.R. at 677. The limited partners sought to have the complaint sealed, arguing that the allegations of wrongdoing were really directed only at the general partner and that they had been named in the complaint purely for strategic reasons, including \"a need to preserve some cause of action or be barred by a statute of limitations, a desire to promote settlement ... [,] and the inability to prosecute the real party in interest, [the general partner], due to the protection of the automatic stay in his Chapter 11 case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 680. The bankruptcy court agreed, holding that \"a reasonable person would alter [his] opinion of Defendants based on a reading of the complaint, because it contains allegations of wrongdoing against the Defendants for, in essence, the acts of [the general partner], without an explanation of the underlying rationale for filing the complaint in this fashion.\" <i>Id.</i> The court's references to the strategic reasons for filing the complaint and the complaint's resulting propensity to mislead the public indicate that it considered the plaintiffs' improper reasons for filing the complaint relevant to its determination that the statements at issue were scandalous or defamatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, both the case law and the interpretation of sources analogous to &#167; 107(b)(2) support a context-sensitive approach to the exception. We agree with the district court that \"to implicate &#167; 107(b)(2) in the context of <i>potentially</i> untrue material, the information would also have to be irrelevant [or] included for improper ends.\" Under this reading of &#167; 107(b)(2), as Congress intended, protection of papers filed in a bankruptcy case will be \"the exception rather than the rule.\" <i>Hope,</i> 38 B.R. at 425.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court alluded to one other category of potentially untrue material that may implicate &#167; 107(b)(2): material that is \"so misleading in context as to be deemed facially inaccurate.\" The court appears to have derived this category, like the improper ends test, from <i>Phar-Mor. See</i> 191 B.R. at 680. The district court did not explain, however, what it means for material to be \"so misleading in context as to be facially inaccurate,\" nor did it explicitly consider the material in the Report with reference to this standard. Having pondered this language for some time, we think its meaning is most akin to the test adopted by the bankruptcy court. Alternatively, it may just be another way of saying that material is potentially untrue. In any event, unlike the other categories set forth in the district court's thoughtful analysis, we find the category \"so misleading in context as to be facially inaccurate\" unhelpful. Even the material at issue in <i>Phar-Mor,</i> the apparent source of the \"so misleading in context\" standard, could also be described as triggering the &#167; 107(b)(2) exception based on its untruthfulness or its potential untruthfulness and its inclusion in the complaint for an improper end. Hence, we will not include this category within the additional showing required by &#167; 107(b)(2) for material that is potentially untrue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude that material that would cause a reasonable person to alter his opinion of an interested party triggers the protections of &#167; 107(b)(2) based on a showing that either (1) the material is untrue, or (2) the material is potentially untrue and irrelevant or included within a bankruptcy filing for an improper end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Application of &#167; 107(b)(2)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the bankruptcy court and the district court concluded that the material in the Report did not fall within the &#167; 107(b)(2) exception, and therefore that the Report had to be publicly accessible. Although the district court made its determination based on a standard similar to the one set forth in this opinion, the bankruptcy court did not. Specifically, the bankruptcy court did not recognize that, under certain circumstances, material that is potentially untrue, in addition to material that a court has determined to be untrue, can trigger the protections of &#167; 107(b)(2). The Gittos assert that if both they and the bankruptcy court misapprehended the standard for applying &#167; 107(b)(2), they are \"entitled, at the least, to the opportunity to argue for impoundment to the Bankruptcy Court under the appropriate standard [and] to point out particular problems with the Report.\" As the Gittos point out, we have remanded at least once in the past to allow the court of first instance to \"evaluate the plaintiffs' complaints in light of the standard [announced on appeal].\" <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque,</i> 889 F.2d 1209, 1223 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, however, that there is no need for a remand in this case because \"application of the correct legal standard could lead to only one conclusion.\" <i>Ward v.

At most, the material in the Report is potentially untrue. Potentially untrue statements are defamatory within the meaning of &#167; 107(b)(2) only if they are also irrelevant or included for improper ends. The contents of the Report do not meet this standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Untruthfulness</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court concluded that the parties seeking protection under &#167; 107(b)(2) had not provided proof that any of the material in the Report is inaccurate. The Gittos do not directly challenge that ruling on appeal. Instead, as will usually happen in these &#167; 107(b)(2) cases, the Gittos' criticism demonstrates only that some material in the Report is potentially untrue. For example, the Gittos assert that \"[o]ne of the greatest problems with the Report is the way the Examiner attributes wrongdoing to the `Gitto [P]rincipals,' a group including more than Charles and Garry Gitto, while conceding that he cannot `allocate [blame] precisely among the three [principals].'\" The Gittos also complain that \"some of the harshest allegations against [them] are highly misleading in that there is a sharp disconnect between the evidence collected by the Examiner and the sweeping conclusions he is willing to advance.\" These contentions do not establish that the Report is untrue, nor would they obligate a bankruptcy court to engage in additional factfinding on the issue. They demonstrate only that material in the Report may later turn out to be untrue, a point which is beyond dispute in light of the acknowledgment in the Report that \"[c]ontinued investigation may lead to evidence which supports or contradicts ... statements [herein].\" Given this caveat and the preliminary nature of the Report, we will assume, as did the district court, that the Report includes potentially untrue material that would cause a reasonable person to alter his opinion of the Gittos.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Irrelevance or inclusion for improper ends</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Material that is potentially untrue and that would cause a reasonable person to alter his opinion of an interested party triggers the protections of &#167; 107(b)(2) if it is also irrelevant to the case in which it was filed or if it is included within a filing for improper ends.

As the Examiner &#8212; an appellee in this case &#8212; relates in his brief, he \"interviewed dozens of witnesses, reviewed thousands of pages of documents, and prepared a Report running more than 150 pages.\" <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1106(a)(4)(A) (requiring the Examiner to file a statement of his investigation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Report catalogs precisely the types of allegations described in 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1104(c) &#8212; namely, \"irregularit[ies] in the management of the affairs of the debtor [Gitto Global] of or by ... former management of the debtor.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>Id.</i> While these allegations may affect the reputations of those at whom they are directed, that possibility, standing alone, does not render them defamatory within the meaning of &#167; 107(b)(2). The information in the Report is directly relevant to the Report's purpose, which the Examiner describes in his brief as creating \"a base of information sufficient [for creditors] to assess whether they may have claims against management, shareholders, or others who have worked with the corporation.\" The fact that the Report will be used by creditors and shareholders to assess their claims, rather than by the court to adjudicate a dispute, does not make the material included therein any less relevant to the bankruptcy case. The relevancy of the material in the Report is similarly unaffected by the fact that the Report discusses pre-petition conduct, as opposed to ongoing conduct. As the district court recognized, \"the avenues a debtor may pursue to recover for arguably improper activity by its <i>former officers and their associates</i> remains of concern to the mission of the bankruptcy court.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

The Examiner's disinterested status in this case is not in question, nor is there any indication whatsoever that he drafted the Report in bad faith or otherwise included the allegedly defamatory material for an improper purpose. <i>Cf. Phar-Mor,</i> 191 B.R. at 679-80 (concluding that a complaint that was filed for \"strategic reasons which would not be apparent[ ] on its face\" fell within the &#167; 107(b)(2) exception).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gittos therefore cannot show that potentially untrue material in the Report is either irrelevant or included for an improper end. Therefore, the bankruptcy court did not err in denying their request for protection under &#167; 107(b)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To qualify for protection under the &#167; 107(b)(2) exception for defamatory material, an interested party must show (1) that the material at issue would alter his reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, and (2) that the material is untrue or that it is potentially untrue and irrelevant or included for an improper end. The Gittos cannot make such a showing with regard to the Report. Therefore, upon issuance of the mandate, and once the Examiner deletes all bank account numbers included in the Report and its exhibits pursuant to the unchallenged ruling of the bankruptcy court regarding the redaction of confidential information, the Report shall be filed publicly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.

On appeal, the appellants focus exclusively on the \"defamatory\" prong of the exception. They do not suggest any definition for the \"scandalous\" prong, nor do they attempt to demonstrate that the Report is scandalous within the meaning of &#167; 107(b)(2). Accordingly, we focus on the \"defamatory\" prong as well</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In light of this conclusion, we also reject the Gittos' contention that the bankruptcy court erred in failing to \"make the careful balance of the interests required by the common law.\" Moreover, the Gittos' arguments regarding the weight to be attributed to different interests under the common law analysis are inapposite</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> All of Gitto Global's officers and directors resigned and were replaced by an independent restructuring officer immediately before the company filed for bankruptcy.

Although the Gittos emphasize that a federal grand jury is investigating \"the same matters investigated by the Examiner,\" they have not indicated that any criminal charges have been filed in connection with the grand jury's investigation, much less that a trial is imminent. Concerns that disclosure of the Report would taint a jury pool are therefore entirely speculative. Moreover, there are many ways to protect a criminal defendant's right to a fair trial without enjoining the public disclosure of information. For example, a court may use the voir dire process to \"identify those jurors whose prior knowledge of the case would disable them from rendering an impartial verdict,\"<i>Press-Enterprise Co. v.

The bankruptcy court rejected this contention, finding that the appellants had not demonstrated that the material at issue was scandalous or defamatory and that it therefore must be publicly available under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 107(a).

(\"Gitto Global\"), a plastics manufacturer in Lunenberg, Massachusetts, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 24, 2004 amid allegations of financial distress and accounting irregularities. Shortly thereafter, the bankruptcy court appointed an Examiner to \"begin an investigation into the existence of any pre[-]petition fraud, dishonesty, incompetence, misconduct, mismanagement, or irregularity in the management and business affairs of the Debtor.\" The Examiner was also instructed to \"file a statement with the Court ... reporting the preliminary or final findings of the Examiner, along with any recommendations of the Examiner for further investigation.\" The purpose of the investigation and the Report was to develop information for use in potential proceedings against Gitto Global.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 8, 2004, the Examiner filed a motion requesting that the court authorize him to submit the Report (which had not yet been filed) under seal and have it impounded pending a further order of the court. In an order dated December 9, 2004, the court allowed the motion, subject to a requirement that any party in interest be allowed to file a motion seeking release of the Report. On January 5, 2005, after receiving several motions seeking access to the Report upon its filing, the court modified its December 9 order to require that within ten days of filing the Report, the Examiner \"provide each person named in the report ... with a copy of only that portion or portions of the report that relate to the individual.\" The modified order also invited motions from individuals seeking to seal or redact the report, as well as objections to motions to seal or redact. The Examiner filed his Report under seal on January 7, 2004 and served redacted copies on approximately 120 individuals pursuant to the court's January 5 order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among those who received redacted copies of the Report were appellant Gary Gitto, part-owner and former CEO of Gitto Global, and appellant Charles Gitto, who held himself out as chairman of Gitto Global and is Gary Gitto's father. The Gittos filed motions requesting that the Report remain under seal, as did approximately twenty-four other individuals. In their motions, the Gittos argued that there was no right of public access to the Report under either the common law or the First Amendment. Gary Gitto further argued that the Report contained scandalous and defamatory material within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 107(b)(2), and therefore that the usual presumption of public access under &#167; 107(a) did not apply. Appellees WT &amp; G and MediaNews, both news organizations, opposed the motions to seal. The appellees argued that there is a right of public access to the Report under the First Amendment, the common law, and &#167; 107(a), and that the appellants had not demonstrated that the Report contained defamatory matter for purposes of &#167; 107(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 9, 2005, after a hearing on the various motions, the bankruptcy court concluded in a memorandum that there was nothing scandalous or defamatory in the Report.

Many, if not the vast majority, of these papers will include material that is likely to affect an individual's reputation in the community. Allegations of mismanagement or fraud, for example, might well cause a reasonable person to alter his opinion of the individual against whom the allegations are made. As one bankruptcy court explained, it would be inconsistent with the presumption of public access in &#167; 107(a) to treat such allegations as defamatory within the meaning of &#167; 107(b)(2):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint ... alleges that Defendants may have received fraudulent transfers....

They dispute, however, the district court's conclusion that a broad reading of the exception would result in the sweeping curtailment of public access. Emphasizing that &#167; 107(b)(2) requires the court to protect a person but does not indicate what form the protection should take, they argue that not all material falling within the &#167; 107(b)(2) exception will necessarily be sealed. Rather, they argue, &#167; 107(b)(2) merely triggers the court's duty to engage in a balancing of the interests as required under the common law. Based on this common law inquiry, the court would then use its discretion to take whatever protective measures justice required, whether it be sealing or a more modest form of protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that &#167; 107(b)(2) speaks of protection in general terms rather than of wholesale sealing, and that courts must therefore exercise some discretion in determining what form of protection to grant. It does not follow, however, that the threshold to qualify for protection under &#167; 107(b)(2) is a low one. The Gittos acknowledge that &#167; 107(a) reflects a legislative decision that papers filed in a bankruptcy case are public records. The reading of &#167; 107(b)(2) that the Gittos propose, <i>i.e.,</i> that any material tending to harm a person's reputation triggers the exception, would significantly curtail the public's access to these records. Once an interested party identifies material that is scandalous or defamatory, the court must protect the party. Although the protection may stop short of sealing the entire document containing the defamatory material, any form of protection will limit the information available to the public. The interpretation of &#167; 107(b)(2) advanced by the Gittos therefore remains problematic despite the seal/protect distinction that they highlight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there is no support for the Gittos' argument that &#167; 107(b)(2) is merely a trigger for the traditional common law analysis regarding public disclosure. The common law requires the court to determine whether the document at issue is a \"judicial record\" subject to the presumption of public access, and, if so, to \"balance[ ] the public interest in the information against privacy interests.\" <i>In re Boston Herald,</i> 321 F.3d at 190. Section 107 displaces this approach entirely. First, it dispenses with the need to determine whether the document at issue is a \"judicial record\" by clarifying that, in the bankruptcy context, the presumption of public access applies to <i>any</i> paper filed in a bankruptcy case, not only the narrower category of papers that would be considered judicial records under the common law. <i>See id.</i> at 180 (for purposes of the common law presumption, \"[n]ot all documents filed with a court are considered judicial documents\") (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>Standard Fin. Mgmt. Corp.,</i> 830 F.2d at 412-13 (\"The presumption that the public has a right to see and copy judicial records attaches to those documents which properly come before the court in the course of an adjudicatory proceeding and which are relevant to the adjudication.\"). Once the presumption of public access attaches under &#167; 107(a), the next step in the inquiry is not to engage in a balancing of the equities, as required by the common law, but rather to determine whether the material at issue falls within a specific exception to the presumption &#8212; namely, into one of the &#167; 107(b) categories. Finally, if material does come within one of the statutory exceptions to public access, &#167; 107 requires a court to act at the request of an interested party &#8212; and permits a court to act <i>sua sponte</i> &#8212; to protect the affected party. In short, &#167; 107 speaks directly to the issues regarding disclosure that are addressed by the common law analysis; its framework is not merely a prelude to the common law analysis. <i>See Phar-Mor,</i> 191 B.R. at 679 (\"In other areas of the law, courts have relied on showings of `compelling reasons,' or balancing the interests of privacy and public right to know, when reviewing a request for judicial non-disclosure. The mandatory language of &#167; 107(b) negates the need for such inquiries.\" (citation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a final effort to defend their position, the Gittos assert that a reading of &#167; 107(b)(2) that does not include a common law balancing of the equities would impermissibly infringe on the courts' traditional supervisory authority over their own records and files, <i>see Nixon,</i> 435 U.S. at 598, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109830\"><a href=\"/opinion/109830/nixon-v-warner-communications-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1306</span></a></span>, by limiting their discretion. Such a reading, the Gittos argue, \"ignores the well-established principle that, where long-standing inherent powers of a court are concerned, in the absence of `clear and unmistakable' congressional intent to restrict them, statutes should be construed so as to preserve the district court's usual role.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have already discussed, &#167; 107 limits the discretion of courts regarding public access to papers filed in a bankruptcy case by providing that all papers filed are public records (and therefore not subject to protective orders) unless material contained therein falls within one of the statutory exceptions, in which case the court \"shall,\" on request of a party in interest, or \"may,\" on its own motion, protect the affected party. This arrangement reflects Congress's intent to cabin the courts' authority over their records and files with regard to public access issues in bankruptcy cases. Section 107 is therefore readily distinguishable from the statute we considered in <i>In re Atlantic Pipe Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200129\"><a href=\"/opinion/200129/in-re-atlantic-pipe-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2002), the case on which the Gittos' argument relies. In <i>Atlantic Pipe Corp.,</i> the issue was whether the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998 (\"ADR Act\") restricted \"the district courts' authority to engage in the case-by-case deployment of ADR procedures.\" <i>Id.</i> at 142. Emphasizing that \"Congress may cabin the district courts' inherent powers [only if] its intention to do so [is] clear and unmistakable,\" we concluded that nothing in the ADR Act, which required judicial districts to adopt some form of ADR procedures, could be interpreted as stripping district court judges of their inherent power to require mediation. <i>Id.</i> The statutory language of &#167; 107, by contrast, evinces a \"clear and unmistakable\" intent to cabin the inherent supervisory authority of district courts over their own records and files when it comes to issues of public access to papers filed in a bankruptcy case. We therefore reject the interpretation of &#167; 107(b)(2) advanced by the Gittos.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Our reading of the exception</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Papers filed in the bankruptcy court do not fall within the &#167; 107(b)(2) exception merely because they would have a detrimental impact on an interested party's reputation. Rather, as both the bankruptcy court and the district court determined, the statute requires something more. The exact nature of this additional showing is not apparent, however, from the face of the statute nor from the legislative history. <i>See</i> Bodoh &amp; Morgan, 24 Hastings Const. L.Q. at 89 (\"Although the class of persons covered by subsection 107(b)(2) is well defined, the type of materials constituting scandalous or defamatory matter is not.\").

Untruth vs. potential untruth</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the bankruptcy court did not explicitly state a test for determining whether material falls within &#167; 107(b)(2), it concluded that a party seeking to invoke the exception must \"come forward with the particular facts that demonstrate the material at issue is scandalous or defamatory.\" In denying all of the motions for protection, the court explained that \"[i]n almost all instances there was no proof\" and noted that some movants \"urged that the Court not divulge to the public information about them even though they do not allege that [the] information ... is factually inaccurate.\" Based on these statements, the district court described the bankruptcy court as holding that \"appellants, in order to enjoy the protection of &#167; 107(b)(2), must demonstrate that material in the Report is untruthful.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court's test is largely unworkable. While some parties seeking protection under &#167; 107(b)(2) may be able to demonstrate untruthfulness solely on the basis of the papers filed with the court, such situations will be rare. More often than not, statements in a court filing are disputed. It would be unrealistic to require the bankruptcy court to resolve these factual disputes at a preliminary stage of the proceedings. The untruthfulness requirement would add an enormous burden to the bankruptcy courts' already heavy docket by turning motions for protection under &#167; 107(b)(2) into an occasion for mini-trials. We therefore emphasize that although a bankruptcy court <i>may</i> grant protection under &#167; 107(b)(2) based on a showing of untruthfulness, protection on this basis is available only in the rare case where the untruthfulness is readily apparent. Bankruptcy courts are under no obligation to resolve questions of truthfulness presented by a &#167; 107(b)(2) motion where doing so would require discovery or additional hearings, or would be otherwise burdensome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In most cases, a party filing a motion for protection under &#167; 107(b)(2) will only be able to show that the material at issue is <i>potentially</i> untrue. Potentially untrue material may also implicate &#167; 107(b)(2). However, given the relative ease of showing potential untruthfulness, such a showing, standing alone, cannot be enough to trigger the exception. To hold otherwise would undermine the policy of public access codified in &#167; 107(a). Therefore, we hold that a party may seek protection under &#167; 107(b)(2) based on <i>potentially</i> untrue information that would alter his reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person. To obtain protection, however, an additional showing must be made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

Exceptions to the common law presumption of public access appear to share the same premise.

The bankruptcy court denied the motion, in part on the ground that \"the statements in question were made in support of [the objector's] allegations that L B &amp; B was not disinterested.\" <i>Id.</i> at 546.

The bankruptcy court ordered that the reports be sealed pursuant to &#167; 107(b)(2). The district court reversed, concluding that there was no evidence that the fee-reviewer's opinions and conclusions were \"even potentially defamatory in nature.\" <i>Id.</i> at 340. The court explained that \"[i]f such legal recommendations and assertions, required to be rendered by statutory and caselaw authority, were sealed based on nothing more than the mere possibility that they contain `defamatory' assertions, the judicial system would be thwarted in its mandated responsibility to supervise litigation expenses.\" <i>Id.</i> This reasoning treats the fact that the fee-reviewer's reports were statutorily-mandated as relevant to the determination that they were not scandalous or defamatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Phar-Mor</i> decision offers further support for a reading of &#167; 107(b)(2) that is sensitive to the purpose of the statements at issue and the context in which they are made. <i>Phar-Mor</i> involved a complaint that alleged wrongdoing by a business entity with a general partner and several limited partners. <i>See</i> 191 B.R. at 677-78. Only the limited partners were named in the complaint because the general partner was protected by an automatic stay, <i>see</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362, but the limited partners were not. <i>See</i> 191 B.R. at 677. The limited partners sought to have the complaint sealed, arguing that the allegations of wrongdoing were really directed only at the general partner and that they had been named in the complaint purely for strategic reasons, including \"a need to preserve some cause of action or be barred by a statute of limitations, a desire to promote settlement ... [,] and the inability to prosecute the real party in interest, [the general partner], due to the protection of the automatic stay in his Chapter 11 case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 680. The bankruptcy court agreed, holding that \"a reasonable person would alter [his] opinion of Defendants based on a reading of the complaint, because it contains allegations of wrongdoing against the Defendants for, in essence, the acts of [the general partner], without an explanation of the underlying rationale for filing the complaint in this fashion.\" <i>Id.</i> The court's references to the strategic reasons for filing the complaint and the complaint's resulting propensity to mislead the public indicate that it considered the plaintiffs' improper reasons for filing the complaint relevant to its determination that the statements at issue were scandalous or defamatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, both the case law and the interpretation of sources analogous to &#167; 107(b)(2) support a context-sensitive approach to the exception. We agree with the district court that \"to implicate &#167; 107(b)(2) in the context of <i>potentially</i> untrue material, the information would also have to be irrelevant [or] included for improper ends.\" Under this reading of &#167; 107(b)(2), as Congress intended, protection of papers filed in a bankruptcy case will be \"the exception rather than the rule.\" <i>Hope,</i> 38 B.R. at 425.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court alluded to one other category of potentially untrue material that may implicate &#167; 107(b)(2): material that is \"so misleading in context as to be deemed facially inaccurate.\" The court appears to have derived this category, like the improper ends test, from <i>Phar-Mor. See</i> 191 B.R. at 680. The district court did not explain, however, what it means for material to be \"so misleading in context as to be facially inaccurate,\" nor did it explicitly consider the material in the Report with reference to this standard. Having pondered this language for some time, we think its meaning is most akin to the test adopted by the bankruptcy court. Alternatively, it may just be another way of saying that material is potentially untrue. In any event, unlike the other categories set forth in the district court's thoughtful analysis, we find the category \"so misleading in context as to be facially inaccurate\" unhelpful. Even the material at issue in <i>Phar-Mor,</i> the apparent source of the \"so misleading in context\" standard, could also be described as triggering the &#167; 107(b)(2) exception based on its untruthfulness or its potential untruthfulness and its inclusion in the complaint for an improper end. Hence, we will not include this category within the additional showing required by &#167; 107(b)(2) for material that is potentially untrue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude that material that would cause a reasonable person to alter his opinion of an interested party triggers the protections of &#167; 107(b)(2) based on a showing that either (1) the material is untrue, or (2) the material is potentially untrue and irrelevant or included within a bankruptcy filing for an improper end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Although the district court made its determination based on a standard similar to the one set forth in this opinion, the bankruptcy court did not. Specifically, the bankruptcy court did not recognize that, under certain circumstances, material that is potentially untrue, in addition to material that a court has determined to be untrue, can trigger the protections of &#167; 107(b)(2). The Gittos assert that if both they and the bankruptcy court misapprehended the standard for applying &#167; 107(b)(2), they are \"entitled, at the least, to the opportunity to argue for impoundment to the Bankruptcy Court under the appropriate standard [and] to point out particular problems with the Report.\" As the Gittos point out, we have remanded at least once in the past to allow the court of first instance to \"evaluate the plaintiffs' complaints in light of the standard [announced on appeal].\" <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano v.

Instead, as will usually happen in these &#167; 107(b)(2) cases, the Gittos' criticism demonstrates only that some material in the Report is potentially untrue. For example, the Gittos assert that \"[o]ne of the greatest problems with the Report is the way the Examiner attributes wrongdoing to the `Gitto [P]rincipals,' a group including more than Charles and Garry Gitto, while conceding that he cannot `allocate [blame] precisely among the three [principals].'\" The Gittos also complain that \"some of the harshest allegations against [them] are highly misleading in that there is a sharp disconnect between the evidence collected by the Examiner and the sweeping conclusions he is willing to advance.\" These contentions do not establish that the Report is untrue, nor would they obligate a bankruptcy court to engage in additional factfinding on the issue. They demonstrate only that material in the Report may later turn out to be untrue, a point which is beyond dispute in light of the acknowledgment in the Report that \"[c]ontinued investigation may lead to evidence which supports or contradicts ... statements [herein].\" Given this caveat and the preliminary nature of the Report, we will assume, as did the district court, that the Report includes potentially untrue material that would cause a reasonable person to alter his opinion of the Gittos.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Irrelevance or inclusion for improper ends</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Material that is potentially untrue and that would cause a reasonable person to alter his opinion of an interested party triggers the protections of &#167; 107(b)(2) if it is also irrelevant to the case in which it was filed or if it is included within a filing for improper ends.

As the Examiner &#8212; an appellee in this case &#8212; relates in his brief, he \"interviewed dozens of witnesses, reviewed thousands of pages of documents, and prepared a Report running more than 150 pages.\" <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1106(a)(4)(A) (requiring the Examiner to file a statement of his investigation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Report catalogs precisely the types of allegations described in 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1104(c) &#8212; namely, \"irregularit[ies] in the management of the affairs of the debtor [Gitto Global] of or by ... former management of the debtor.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>Id.</i> While these allegations may affect the reputations of those at whom they are directed, that possibility, standing alone, does not render them defamatory within the meaning of &#167; 107(b)(2). The information in the Report is directly relevant to the Report's purpose, which the Examiner describes in his brief as creating \"a base of information sufficient [for creditors] to assess whether they may have claims against management, shareholders, or others who have worked with the corporation.\" The fact that the Report will be used by creditors and shareholders to assess their claims, rather than by the court to adjudicate a dispute, does not make the material included therein any less relevant to the bankruptcy case. The relevancy of the material in the Report is similarly unaffected by the fact that the Report discusses pre-petition conduct, as opposed to ongoing conduct. As the district court recognized, \"the avenues a debtor may pursue to recover for arguably improper activity by its <i>former officers and their associates</i> remains of concern to the mission of the bankruptcy court.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

The Examiner's disinterested status in this case is not in question, nor is there any indication whatsoever that he drafted the Report in bad faith or otherwise included the allegedly defamatory material for an improper purpose. <i>Cf. Phar-Mor,</i> 191 B.R. at 679-80 (concluding that a complaint that was filed for \"strategic reasons which would not be apparent[ ] on its face\" fell within the &#167; 107(b)(2) exception).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gittos therefore cannot show that potentially untrue material in the Report is either irrelevant or included for an improper end.
