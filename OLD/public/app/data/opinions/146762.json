ANTONIO RAMÍREZ-GONZÁLEZ; SINDICATO DE ASEGURADORES PARA LA\n SUSCRIPCIÓN CONJUNTA DE SEGUROS DE RESPONSIBILIDAD PROFESIONAL\n                   MÉDICO-HOSPITALARIA (SIMED),\n\n                     Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n          [Hon. Jaime Pieras, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n          Torruella, Lipez, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     David Efron, with whom Joanne V. González-Varon was on brief,\nfor appellants.\n     Eugene F. Hestres-Vélez, with whom Ramonita Dieppa Law\nOffices, Ramonita Dieppa-González, Bird Bird & Hestres, P.S.C., E.\nFrancois Hestres-Rodríguez, and María Z. Trigo-Ferraioulli were on\nbrief, for appellees.\n\n\n                          May 19, 2010\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.               In this diversity malpractice\n\naction, the appellants claim that their son, G.P.P., suffered\n\ncatastrophic injuries during and immediately following his birth\n\nbecause   of   the   negligence     of    appellee,    Dr.    Antonio      Ramírez-\n\nGonzález, the obstetrician who performed G.P.P.'s delivery.                   After\n\nthe   plaintiffs     presented    their       case-in-chief   to    a    jury,   the\n\ndistrict court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of\n\nRamírez-González.        The     Court    concluded    that   the       plaintiffs'\n\nevidence was insufficient to establish two elements of a medical\n\nmalpractice claim: a departure from the relevant standard of care\n\nand a causal relationship between the departure and the harm to\n\ntheir son.\n\n           On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the district court\n\ncommitted reversible error when it made several evidentiary rulings\n\nthat resulted in the exclusion of expert testimony.                     Because we\n\nagree that the district court improperly limited the testimony of\n\none of the plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Carolyn Crawford, we vacate the\n\njudgment for Ramírez-González and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                         I.\n\nA. Background\n\n           Consistent with the applicable standard of review for a\n\njudgment as a matter of law, we recite the relevant facts in the\n\nlight most favorable to the plaintiffs.               See EnergyNorth Natural\n\nGas, Inc., v. Century Indem. Co., 452 F.3d 44, 46 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fDefendant,   Dr.   Antonio      Ramírez-González,1    was    plaintiff   Dilma\n\nPagés-Ramírez's physician during her pregnancy with G.P.P. and\n\nattended at his birth.        Pagés-Ramírez visited Dr. Ramírez-González\n\non at least seven occasions for prenatal care during her pregnancy.\n\nShe was expected to deliver on or around June 1, 2005.\n\n          On    May   19,     2005,   Pagés-Ramírez   arrived    at   Hospital\n\nAuxilio Mutuo in active labor.            When her labor did not progress\n\nover the next few hours, she received intravenous Pitocin, a drug\n\nused to increase the frequency of contractions, her water was\n\nartificially broken, and an epidural anaesthetic was begun.              When\n\nPagés-Ramírez was fully dilated, an attempt was made to use vacuum\n\nextraction to deliver G.P.P.              That attempt was unsuccessful.\n\nRamírez-González eventually delivered G.P.P. by cesarean section\n\n(\"c-section\").\n\n          After       the     delivery,      Pagés-Ramírez    required    the\n\ntransfusion of four units of blood.             She remained hospitalized\n\nuntil May 24, 2005.         G.P.P. was in critical condition when he was\n\ndelivered.     He remained in intensive care until August 5, 2005,\n\nwhen he was discharged to another hospital where he continued to\n\nreceive treatment for brain damage and physical abnormalities.\n\nG.P.P.'s current prognosis is bleak. He has permanent brain damage\n\n\n\n     1\n       Ramírez-González has a medical malpractice policy issued by\nInsurers Syndicate for the Joint Underwriting of Medical-Hospital\nProfessional Liability Insurance (SIMED). SIMED is also a named\ndefendant in this action.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fand has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy.         Due to organ damage,\n\nhe must be fed through a tube in his abdominal wall.                  Those\n\nconditions are not expected to improve over time.\n\n           On May 11, 2007, Pagés-Ramírez brought this suit in\n\nfederal district court along with her husband, Michael Pietri\n\nPozzi, on behalf of themselves and G.P.P. (collectively \"the\n\nplaintiffs\"), alleging that medical malpractice by Ramírez-González\n\nand   Hospital   Español   Auxilio    Mutuo   de    Puerto    Rico    caused\n\ncatastrophic injury to G.P.P.2           Early in the litigation, the\n\nplaintiffs reached a confidential settlement with the hospital and\n\nits insurer, Admiral Insurance Company.\n\n           The plaintiffs' remaining malpractice claims against\n\nRamírez-González     alleged,   specifically,      that   Ramírez-González\n\ndeparted from the standard of care by, among other things, failing\n\nto elicit a comprehensive obstetrical history from Pagés-Ramírez,\n\nfailing to estimate G.P.P.'s fetal weight and to enter it into the\n\ndelivery   record,   attempting   a   mid-pelvic     delivery    by   vacuum\n\nextraction, failing to use an internal fetal heart monitor, and\n\nfailing to timely call for a c-section delivery.             The plaintiffs\n\nclaimed that those deviations from the standard of care resulted in\n\nprofound multi-organ damage to G.P.P., as well as respiratory\n\n\n\n      2\n       The plaintiffs are residents of Orlando, Florida.       The\ndefendant is a resident of Puerto Rico, where the events described\nin the complaint occurred. The district court had jurisdiction\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(2).\n\n                                   -4-\n\ffailure, sepsis, asphyxia and seizures.               They further alleged that\n\nthey have suffered emotional anguish as a result of the trauma to\n\nG.P.P., and that, due to their limited economic resources, G.P.P.\n\nhas not been able to receive sufficient medical care or therapy.\n\nB. The Trial\n\n            Trial by jury began on May 1, 2008.                  The plaintiffs\n\nproposed to call three medical expert witnesses as part of their\n\ncase-in-chief.         One of those experts, an obstetrician, failed to\n\nappear because of illness, and the trial court ruled that his\n\ndeposition testimony could not be admitted into evidence in his\n\nabsence.        When   the   plaintiffs      called   their    next   two   medical\n\nexperts,    a    specialist     in    neonatal/perinatal       medicine3     and   a\n\nneurologist, the court limited the testimony of each one, ruling\n\nthat the doctors were not qualified to offer testimony on either\n\nthe appropriate standard of care for an obstetrician in Ramírez-\n\nGonzález's position, or on the issue of whether any deviations from\n\nthe standard of care caused the injuries to G.P.P.\n\n            Predictably, when the plaintiffs had finished presenting\n\ntheir case, the court had to grant Ramírez-González's motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law.                 Without the testimony of their\n\nmissing    expert      and   with    their   two   remaining    medical     experts\n\n\n\n     3\n       Perinatology is the branch of medicine concerned with the\ncare of the mother and fetus during pregnancy, labor, and delivery.\nNeonatology is the branch of medicine concerned with the care,\ndevelopment, and diseases of newborn infants.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fprecluded from testifying on the standard of care and causation,\n\nthe plaintiffs did not have enough evidence to support their\n\nclaims.\n\n             Although the plaintiffs contest all of the abovementioned\n\nevidentiary rulings on appeal, we focus here on the court's ruling\n\nthat the plaintiffs' expert in neonatal and perinatal medicine, Dr.\n\nCarolyn Crawford, would not be permitted to offer testimony on the\n\nstandard of care and causation.               As we explain, that erroneous\n\nruling alone requires a new trial.\n\n                                        II.\n\nA. Elements of Medical Malpractice\n\n             This diversity suit is governed by the substantive law of\n\nPuerto Rico.     See Marcano Rivera v. Turbado Med. Ctr., 415 F.3d\n\n162,   167    (1st     Cir.    2005).     In    Puerto   Rico,    as   in   many\n\njurisdictions, in order to prevail on a medical malpractice claim,\n\n\"a party must establish (1) the duty owed; (2) an act or omission\n\ntransgressing that duty; and (3) a sufficient causal nexus between\n\nthe breach and the harm.\"         Id. (citation omitted).        In the context\n\nof medical malpractice actions, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has\n\nexplained that a physician's duty is \"to offer his or her patient\n\nthat medical care, attention, skill, and protection that, in the\n\nlight of the modern means of communication and education, and\n\npursuant to the current status of scientific knowledge and medical\n\npractice,      meets     the     professional      requirements        generally\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\facknowledged by the medical profession.\" Santiago Otero v. Méndez,\n\n1994 P.R.-Eng. 909,224 (1994).   To prevail, a plaintiff must prove\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence both that the standard of care\n\nwas not met, and that the failure to meet an acceptable standard\n\ncaused the harm.     Id.   In order to determine the applicable\n\nstandard of care in a medical malpractice action and to make a\n\njudgment on causation, a trier of fact will generally need the\n\nassistance of expert testimony.        See Rojas-Ithier v. Sociedad\n\nEspanola de Auxilio Mutuo y Beneficiencia de P.R., 394 F.3d 40, 43\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (citing Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of San Juan,\n\n1 F.3d 74, 78 (1st Cir. 1993)); Lama v. Boras, 16 F.3d 473, 478\n\n(1st Cir. 1994)).\n\nB. Admission of Expert Testimony\n\n          The admission of expert testimony is governed by Federal\n\nRule of Evidence 702.   Rule 702 requires that expert testimony be\n\n(1) \"based upon sufficient facts or data,\" (2) \"the product of\n\nreliable principles and methods,\" and (3) that the witness apply\n\n\"the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\"   We\n\nhave described the trial judge as the gatekeeper in applying Rule\n\n702's admissibility criteria. Gaydar v. Sociedad Instituto Gineco-\n\nQuirurgico y Planificacion Familiar, 345 F.3d 15, 24 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).   The judge must decide \"whether the scientific, technical,\n\nor other specialized knowledge [the expert] offers 'will assist the\n\ntrier better to understand a fact in issue.'\"    Id. (quoting United\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fStates v. Alzanki, 54 F.3d 994, 1005 (1st Cir. 1995)).               The judge\n\nmust ensure that an expert's testimony \"'both rests on a reliable\n\nfoundation and is relevant to the task at hand.'\"             United States v.\n\nMooney, 315 F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting                    Daubert v.\n\nMerrell Dow Pharm., 509 U.S. 579, 597 (1993)).                 As part of its\n\ninquiry, the trial court must \"determine whether the putative\n\nexpert is qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or\n\neducation,\" to offer testimony.             Mitchell v. United States, 141\n\nF.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir. 1998) (citation omitted).              We have explained,\n\nhowever, that \"[t]he proffered expert physician need not be a\n\nspecialist in a particular medical discipline to render expert\n\ntestimony relating to that discipline.\"            Gaydar, 345 F.3d at 24.\n\n             In Mitchell, we held that an expert, an internist with a\n\nspecialty in hematology and oncology, was qualified to opine on the\n\nstandard of care that should have been met by a gastroenterologist\n\nperforming a colonoscopy.         141 F.3d at 15.        Similarly, in Gaydar,\n\nwe   found   that   \"the   mere    fact     that   [an    expert]   was   not   a\n\ngynecologist does not mean that he was not qualified to give expert\n\ntestimony regarding [the plaintiff's] pregnancy.\"              345 F.3d at 24.\n\n             Although credentials such as board certification in a\n\nparticular medical specialty may indicate that an expert's opinion\n\nis \"entitled to greater weight,\" such certification has \"never been\n\nheld a prerequisite to qualification as an expert medical witness.\"\n\n Alvarado v. Weinberger, 511 F.2d 1046, 1049 (1st Cir. 1975) (per\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fcuriam).    Indeed, we have noted that it would be an abuse of\n\ndiscretion to exclude testimony that would otherwise \"assist the\n\ntrier better to understand a fact in issue,\" simply because the\n\nexpert does not have the specialization that the court considers\n\nmost appropriate.     Gaydar, 345 F.3d at 24-25 (citing Holbrook v.\n\nLykes Bros. S.S. Co., 80 F.3d 777, 782 (3d Cir. 1996) (finding an\n\nabuse of discretion when the trial judge prohibited physician\n\nspecializing in internal medicine from opining on plaintiff's\n\ncancer because he was not an oncologist)).\n\nC. Dr. Crawford's Credentials\n\n            Dr. Carolyn Crawford is a specialist in pediatrics and\n\nneonatal and perinatal medicine. The pretrial order specified that\n\nthe   plaintiffs    would    call    her   as    an   \"expert       in   neonatology\n\nregarding her review of the pertinent records, the standards of\n\ncare within her field of expertise applicable to this case, the\n\ndefendants'     departures    from    such      standards,    about        [G.P.P.'s]\n\ncondition and the causal relationship between said condition and\n\nthe defendants' departures.\"         Upon Ramírez-González's motion, the\n\nparties conducted a Daubert inquiry outside the presence of the\n\njury into Dr. Crawford's credentials.             See Daubert, 509 U.S. 579.\n\nAt that hearing, Dr. Crawford was asked to elaborate on her\n\nqualifications, which we summarize here.\n\n            After   obtaining       her    medical     degree,       Dr.     Crawford\n\ncompleted   a   pediatric    residency       followed    by     a    fellowship    in\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fneonatal-perinatal medicine.           She is board certified in neonatal-\n\nperinatal     medicine.     As     a    specialist    in   neonatal-perinatal\n\nmedicine, Dr. Crawford deals with \"problems during pregnancy,\n\nlabor, and delivery that [a]ffect [the baby].\"                She served for\n\nseveral years as the medical director of the Southern New Jersey\n\nPerinatal Cooperative.       In that role, she developed a statewide\n\neducational    program    called       Perinatal   Emergencies.     Her   team\n\npresented a \"standard of care, that is the appropriate thing to do\n\nin such a situation.       For instance, with fetal monitoring, that\n\nwhen uterine hyper stimulation occurs, that you did a number of\n\nthings. You turn off the Pitocin.             You give fluids, oxygen, change\n\nposition.   Subsequently, we recommended that [terbutaline], which\n\nis a uterine relaxation drug, be considered to relax the uterus,\n\nallow better blood flow and oxygen to the fetus; and that the\n\npatient be evaluated for a timely delivery.\"\n\n            Dr. Crawford has written chapters for several published\n\nmedical books.     Most relevantly, she authored a chapter on fetal\n\nasphyxia, which covers the administration of Pitocin, and a chapter\n\nentitled, \"Differential Diagnosis of Respiratory Distress,\" which\n\nwas intended \"to help physicians understand when they have a baby\n\nthat wasn't breathing or a baby that had breathing problems how to\n\ndifferentiate what the cause of those were.\"\n\n            Although Dr. Crawford does not perform c-sections, she\n\nhas served as a consultant in high-risk deliveries and \"set the\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fwheels   in    motion\"    when   she    determined      that   a   c-section   was\n\nindicated.      Thus, she \"can identify the problems and prepare the\n\npatient.\"     She has been \"trained to identify ominous patterns on a\n\nfetal monitor and to evaluate whether the patient is likely to be\n\nable to deliver quickly vaginally or whether a cesarean section\n\nwill be needed.\"         She also conducts peer review evaluations of\n\nunexpected outcomes after delivery.             Such review involves taking\n\ninto account \"the obstetrical care, the obstetrical nursing care,\n\nthe delivery care, the neonatal management.\"                   Dr. Crawford has\n\npreviously     been    qualified   to    testify   on    departures     from   the\n\nstandard of care in obstetrics in both state and federal cases.\n\nD. The Decision to Limit Dr. Crawford's Testimony\n\n              After hearing the evidence outlined above, the district\n\ncourt issued an order precluding Dr. Crawford from providing \"her\n\nopinion as to obstetrical standards of care, departures from these\n\nstandards, or causation in this case.\"                  The court agreed with\n\nRamírez-González's argument that \"because Dr. Crawford's experience\n\nand training is not in obstetrics and gynecology, she cannot\n\nprovide expert testimony regarding the alleged departures in the\n\nstandards of care committed by Defendant [], an obstetrician-\n\ngynecologist.\"        Citing Dr. Crawford's lack of board certification\n\nin obstetrics and gynecology and her statement that it is typically\n\nan   obstetrician/gynecologist          who    \"makes    the   final   decisions\n\nregarding a woman in labor,\" the court ruled that Dr. Crawford\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fwould not be permitted to \"testify as to the events that occurred\n\nbefore and during the cesarean section,\" and that she could not\n\n\"provide any testimony pertaining to the cause of [G.P.P.]'s\n\ninjuries.\"      Dr. Crawford proceeded to testify only about G.P.P's\n\nmedical conditions and the testing that he underwent immediately\n\nfollowing his birth.\n\n             We review a trial court's decision to admit or exclude\n\nexpert testimony for abuse of discretion.           Gaydar, 345 F.3d at 24.\n\nA \"district court enjoys substantial discretion to decide whether\n\nto admit or exclude relevant expert testimony.\" Mitchell, 141 F.3d\n\nat 14.   As we described above, the judge's task is to ensure that\n\nthe expert's testimony \"'both rests on a reliable foundation and is\n\nrelevant to the task at hand.'\"         Mooney, 315 F.3d at 62 (quoting\n\nDaubert, 509 U.S. at 597).         In carrying out this responsibility,\n\nthe trial court must bear in mind that an expert with appropriate\n\ncredentials and an appropriate foundation for the opinion at issue\n\nmust be permitted to present testimony as long as the testimony has\n\na   \"tendency    to   make   the   existence   of   any   fact   that    is   of\n\nconsequence to the determination of the action more probable or\n\nless probable than it would be without the evidence.\"                   Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 401.    An unduly restrictive review of the relevant expertise\n\nof a physician is incompatible with what we have characterized as\n\na liberal standard of relevance. Mitchell, 141 F.3d at 14 (quoting\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fDaubert, 509 U.S. at 587) (noting that Rule 401's \"'basic standard\n\nof relevance [] is a liberal one'\").\n\n              In    light   of    these   standards,    we   conclude    that   the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion when it refused to permit Dr.\n\nCrawford to testify on the relevant standard of care and causation.\n\nThe   court    mistakenly        relied   on   Dr.   Crawford's   lack   of   board\n\ncertification in obstetrics and gynecology to preclude her from\n\ntestifying.        In its Opinion and Order granting Ramírez-González's\n\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law, the court explained:\n\n                     Dr. Crawford testified that she was not\n              board-certified in OB/GYN, and that she had no\n              privileges to administer [P]itocin to a\n              patient or to perform a cesarean section. She\n              further testified that although she serves as\n              a consultant at high-risk[] births, it is the\n              OB/GYN who actually delivers the baby and\n              makes the final decisions regarding the\n              delivery.\n                     Accordingly, the Court rule[s] that Dr.\n              Crawford's testimony be limited to exclude any\n              testimony regarding OB/GYN standards of care,\n              departures from OB/GYN standards of care, and\n              causation.\n\nThe court thus found that because Dr. Crawford herself is not\n\ncertified to administer Pitocin or perform c-sections, she would\n\nnot be qualified to opine on the alleged departures from the\n\nstandards of care committed by Ramírez-González, an obstetrician-\n\ngynecologist.\n\n              That logic is flawed.            The dispositive question is not\n\nwhether an expert is board certified in a particular medical\n\nspecialty.         Rather, the Rules of Evidence require that the judge\n\n                                          -13-\n\fadmit expert testimony relevant to the disposition of the case when\n\nit will assist the trier of fact in understanding a fact in issue\n\nand rests on a reliable foundation.            See Fed. R. Evid. 702; Mooney,\n\n315 F.3d at 62; Gaydar, 345 F.3d at 24.\n\n            Dr.    Crawford's      credentials    easily    meet     and,   indeed,\n\nsurpass the standard for admissibility of expert testimony. She is\n\nboard-certified in, and practices, perinatal and neonatal medicine.\n\nAs enumerated above, she has published book chapters that deal with\n\nthe administration of Pitocin.             She has served as a consultant at\n\nhigh-risk      deliveries    and     has    recommended    that     c-sections     be\n\nperformed.        She conducts peer review evaluations that involve\n\ntaking into account the obstetrical and delivery care that a\n\npatient is given, and she has worked on guidelines for responding\n\nto perinatal emergencies.           She has \"scientific, technical, [and]\n\nother specialized knowledge\" that \"will assist the trier better to\n\nunderstand a fact in issue.\"               Gaydar, 345 F.3d at 24 (citation\n\nomitted).    Her knowledge \"rests on a reliable foundation,\" Mooney,\n\n315 F.3d at 62, i.e., her medical education and many years of\n\nexperience in the field.        Her testimony is \"relevant to the task at\n\nhand.\"   Id.    Indeed, without Dr. Crawford's testimony on causation\n\nand the standard of care, the plaintiffs were unable to present\n\nevidence on two elements of their case.\n\n            Trying    to    defend    the    district     court's    ruling   on    a\n\ndifferent ground, Ramírez-González argues that, whether or not she\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fwas properly credentialed to serve as an expert, Dr. Crawford's\n\ntestimony was correctly excluded because the plaintiffs did not\n\ndisclose her prior to the trial as an expert in the appropriate\n\nstandard of care and causation.     In making this argument, Ramírez-\n\nGonzález attempts to analogize the district court's limitation on\n\nDr. Crawford's testimony in this case to the district court's\n\npreclusion    of   expert   testimony    that   we   recently   upheld   in\n\nMartínez-Serrano v. Quality Health Services. of Puerto Rico, Inc.,\n\n568 F.3d 278 (1st Cir. 2009).            In that case, the plaintiffs\n\n\"attempted to reformulate their theory of liability (and, thus,\n\ndramatically shift the focus of their expert's opinion testimony).\"\n\nId. at 283.    We found that the substantive change in the opinion\n\nbeing offered by an expert for the plaintiffs amounted to a failure\n\nto meet the district court's deadline for \"identification of\n\nexperts and the disclosure of their opinions.\"         Id.   We refused to\n\nfind an abuse of discretion when the trial court precluded that\n\nexpert from offering testimony because of the untimeliness of the\n\ndisclosure of his opinions.        Id. at 284.       We noted that \"the\n\nplaintiffs had flouted a clearly expressed discovery deadline\n\nwithout any apparent justification and under circumstances redolent\n\nof strategic behavior.\"     Id.\n\n          Ramírez-González's effort to cast the events in this case\n\ninto the mold of Martínez-Serrano is unavailing. Although there may\n\nbe some merit to Ramírez-González's contention that Dr. Nathanson\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fwas to be the plaintiffs' principal witness on causation and the\n\nstandard of care, the record shows that Dr. Crawford was set to\n\ntestify on those issues as well. The pretrial order stated that Dr.\n\nCrawford would \"testify as an expert in neonatology regarding her\n\nreview of the pertinent records, the standards of care within her\n\nfield       of   expertise   applicable   to    this   case,   the    defendants'\n\ndepartures from such standards, about [G.P.P.]'s condition as it\n\nrelates to her field of expertise, and the estimated cost of his\n\nlife care.\"4        Moreover, her report, which was provided to Ramírez-\n\nGonzález well in advance of the trial,5 dealt extensively with\n\nG.P.P.'s         treatment   and    concluded   with    a   section    entitled,\n\n\"Causation: Opinions.\"             There is no support in the record for\n\nRamírez-González's claim that he would have been surprised and\n\nunfairly prejudiced if Dr. Crawford had been allowed to testify on\n\nthe standard of care and causation.6             Moreover, it is noteworthy\n\n\n        4\n       Although this reference to neonatology, viewed in isolation,\nmight suggest that Dr. Crawford was only going to testify about the\ncare and development of G.P.P. after his birth, the actual\ndescription of the scope of Dr. Crawford's testimony and the\nsubstance of the section of her report entitled, \"Causation:\nOpinions,\" see infra n. 6, made it abundantly clear that her\nproposed testimony would not be limited to the field of\nneonatology.\n        5\n       The report was attached as an exhibit in support of the\nplaintiffs' opposition to the defendant's motion for summary\njudgment and added to the docket in March 2008, three months prior\nto the trial. As such, it was served on defendant.\n        6\n      In the section of her report entitled \"Causation: Opinions,\"\nDr. Crawford wrote, among other things:\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fthat the district court does not mention a failure to disclose the\n\nsubstance of Dr. Crawford's testimony in its opinion and order\n\nlimiting Dr. Crawford's testimony.     It is clear that the district\n\ncourt instead based its decision to limit Dr. Crawford's testimony\n\non its erroneous assessment of her credentials after hearing her\n\ntestify in the Daubert hearing.\n\n          Judgment   vacated.     Remanded   for   further   proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.   Costs are awarded to the appellants.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n          Pitocin was used indiscriminately resulting in\n          uterine    hyperstimulation    and    impaired\n          teroplacental perfusion which depleted his\n          fetal reserves.    The abnormal labor pattern\n          for a multigravida was not appreciated. . . .\n               The records do not indicate any awareness\n          that [G.P.P.] was such a big baby and the\n          prenatal records were silent in terms of\n          fundal height. . . .         Vacuum use was\n          inappropriate and traumatic adding further\n          insult to injury and resulted in a prolonged\n          (32 minute) bradycardia. The [c-section] was\n          delayed which contributed to the profound\n          acidosis and CNS insult that he sustained.\n\n                                -17-\n\f",

Francois Hestres-Rodríguez, and María Z. Trigo-Ferraioulli were on brief, for appellees.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, LIPEZ, and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>In this diversity malpractice action, the appellants claim that their son, G.P.P., suffered catastrophic injuries during and immediately following his birth because of the negligence of appellee, Dr. Antonio Ramírez-González, the obstetrician who performed G.P.P.'s delivery. After the plaintiffs presented their case-in-chief to a jury, the district court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of Ramírez-González. The Court concluded that the plaintiffs' evidence was insufficient to establish two elements of a medical malpractice claim: a departure from the relevant standard of care and a causal relationship between the departure and the harm to their son.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the district court committed reversible error when it made several evidentiary rulings that resulted in the exclusion of expert testimony. Because we agree that the district court improperly limited the testimony of one of the plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Carolyn Crawford, we vacate the judgment for Ramírez-González and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Background</h2>\n<p>Consistent with the applicable standard of review for a judgment as a matter of law, we recite the relevant facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. <i>See </i><i>EnergyNorth Natural Gas, Inc., v. Century Indem. Co.,</i> 452 F.3d 44, 46 (1st Cir. 2006). Defendant, Dr. Antonio Ramírez-González,<sup>[1]</sup> was plaintiff Dilma Pagés-Ramírez's physician during her pregnancy with G.P.P. and attended at his birth. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*112</span> Pagés-Ramírez visited Dr. Ramírez-González on at least seven occasions for prenatal care during her pregnancy. She was expected to deliver on or around June 1, 2005.</p>\n<p>On May 19, 2005, Pagés-Ramírez arrived at Hospital Auxilio Mutuo in active labor. When her labor did not progress over the next few hours, she received intravenous Pitocin, a drug used to increase the frequency of contractions, her water was artificially broken, and an epidural anaesthetic was begun. When Pagés-Ramírez was fully dilated, an attempt was made to use vacuum extraction to deliver G.P.P. That attempt was unsuccessful. Ramírez-González eventually delivered G.P.P. by cesarean section (\"c-section\").</p>\n<p>After the delivery, Pagés-Ramírez required the transfusion of four units of blood. She remained hospitalized until May 24, 2005. G.P.P. was in critical condition when he was delivered. He remained in intensive care until August 5, 2005, when he was discharged to another hospital where he continued to receive treatment for brain damage and physical abnormalities. G.P.P.'s current prognosis is bleak. He has permanent brain damage and has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Due to organ damage, he must be fed through a tube in his abdominal wall. Those conditions are not expected to improve over time.</p>\n<p>On May 11, 2007, Pagés-Ramírez brought this suit in federal district court along with her husband, Michael Pietri Pozzi, on behalf of themselves and G.P.P. (collectively \"the plaintiffs\"), alleging that medical malpractice by Ramírez-González and Hospital Español Auxilio Mutuo de Puerto Rico caused catastrophic injury to G.P.P.<sup>[2]</sup> Early in the litigation, the plaintiffs reached a confidential settlement with the hospital and its insurer, Admiral Insurance Company.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' remaining malpractice claims against Ramírez-González alleged, specifically, that Ramírez-González departed from the standard of care by, among other things, failing to elicit a comprehensive obstetrical history from Pagés-Ramírez, failing to estimate G.P.P.'s fetal weight and to enter it into the delivery record, attempting a mid-pelvic delivery by vacuum extraction, failing to use an internal fetal heart monitor, and failing to timely call for a c-section delivery. The plaintiffs claimed that those deviations from the standard of care resulted in profound multi-organ damage to G.P.P., as well as respiratory failure, sepsis, asphyxia and seizures. They further alleged that they have suffered emotional anguish as a result of the trauma to G.P.P., and that, due to their limited economic resources, G.P.P. has not been able to receive sufficient medical care or therapy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Trial</h2>\n<p>Trial by jury began on May 1, 2008. The plaintiffs proposed to call three medical expert witnesses as part of their case-in-chief. One of those experts, an obstetrician, failed to appear because of illness, and the trial court ruled that his deposition testimony could not be admitted into evidence in his absence. When the plaintiffs called their next two medical experts, a specialist in neonatal/perinatal medicine<sup>[3]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> and a neurologist, the court limited the testimony of each one, ruling that the doctors were not qualified to offer testimony on either the appropriate standard of care for an obstetrician in Ramírez-González's position, or on the issue of whether any deviations from the standard of care caused the injuries to G.P.P.</p>\n<p>Predictably, when the plaintiffs had finished presenting their case, the court had to grant Ramírez-González's motion for judgment as a matter of law. Without the testimony of their missing expert and with their two remaining medical experts precluded from testifying on the standard of care and causation, the plaintiffs did not have enough evidence to support their claims.</p>\n<p>Although the plaintiffs contest all of the abovementioned evidentiary rulings on appeal, we focus here on the court's ruling that the plaintiffs' expert in neonatal and perinatal medicine, Dr. Carolyn Crawford, would not be permitted to offer testimony on the standard of care and causation. As we explain, that erroneous ruling alone requires a new trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Elements of Medical Malpractice</h2>\n<p>This diversity suit is governed by the substantive law of Puerto Rico. <i>See </i><i>Marcano Rivera v. Turbado Med. Ctr.,</i> 415 F.3d 162, 167 (1st Cir.2005). In Puerto Rico, as in many jurisdictions, in order to prevail on a medical malpractice claim, \"a party must establish (1) the duty owed; (2) an act or omission transgressing that duty; and (3) a sufficient causal nexus between the breach and the harm.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted). In the context of medical malpractice actions, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has explained that a physician's duty is \"to offer his or her patient that medical care, attention, skill, and protection that, in the light of the modern means of communication and education, and pursuant to the current status of scientific knowledge and medical practice, meets the professional requirements generally acknowledged by the medical profession.\" <i>Santiago Otero v. Méndez,</i> 1994 P.R.-Eng. 909,224, 1994 WL 909224 (1994). To prevail, a plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence both that the standard of care was not met, and that the failure to meet an acceptable standard caused the harm. <i>Id.</i> In order to determine the applicable standard of care in a medical malpractice action and to make a judgment on causation, a trier of fact will generally need the assistance of expert testimony. <i>See </i><i>Rojas-Ithier v. Sociedad Espanola de Auxilio Mutuo y Beneficiencia de P.R.,</i> 394 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir.2005) (citing <i>Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of San Juan,</i> 1 F.3d 74, 78 (1st Cir.1993); <i>Lama v. Borras,</i> 16 F.3d 473, 478 (1st Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Admission of Expert Testimony</h2>\n<p>The admission of expert testimony is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 702. Rule 702 requires that expert testimony be (1) \"based upon sufficient facts or data,\" (2) \"the product of reliable principles and methods,\" and (3) that the witness apply \"the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\" We have described the trial judge as the gatekeeper in applying Rule 702's admissibility criteria. <i>Gaydar v. Sociedad Instituto Gineco-Quirurgico y Planificacion Familiar,</i> 345 F.3d 15, 24 (1st Cir.2003). The judge must decide \"whether the scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge [the expert] offers `will assist the trier better to understand a fact in issue.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Alzanki,</i> 54 F.3d 994, 1005 (1st Cir.1995)). The judge must ensure that an expert's testimony \"`both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.'\" <i>United States v. Mooney,</i> 315 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm.,</i> 509 U.S. 579, 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993)). As part of its inquiry, the trial court must \"determine whether the putative expert is qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education,\" to offer testimony. <i>Mitchell v. United States,</i> 141 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir.1998) (citation omitted). We have explained, however, that \"[t]he proffered expert physician need not be a specialist in a particular medical discipline to render expert testimony relating to that discipline.\" <i>Gaydar,</i> 345 F.3d at 24.</p>\n<p>In <i>Mitchell,</i> we held that an expert, an internist with a specialty in hematology and oncology, was qualified to opine on the standard of care that should have been met by a gastroenterologist performing a colonoscopy. 141 F.3d at 15. Similarly, in <i>Gaydar,</i> we found that \"the mere fact that [an expert] was not a gynecologist does not mean that he was not qualified to give expert testimony regarding [the plaintiff's] pregnancy.\" 345 F.3d at 24.</p>\n<p>Although credentials such as board certification in a particular medical specialty may indicate that an expert's opinion is \"entitled to greater weight,\" such certification has \"never been held a prerequisite to qualification as an expert medical witness.\" <i>Alvarado v. Weinberger,</i> 511 F.2d 1046, 1049 (1st Cir.1975) (per curiam). Indeed, we have noted that it would be an abuse of discretion to exclude testimony that would otherwise \"assist the trier better to understand a fact in issue,\" simply because the expert does not have the specialization that the court considers most appropriate. <i>Gaydar,</i> 345 F.3d at 24-25 (citing <i>Holbrook v. Lykes Bros. S.S. Co.,</i> 80 F.3d 777, 782 (3d Cir.1996) (finding an abuse of discretion when the trial judge prohibited physician specializing in internal medicine from opining on plaintiff's cancer because he was not an oncologist)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Dr. Crawford's Credentials</h2>\n<p>Dr. Carolyn Crawford is a specialist in pediatrics and neonatal and perinatal medicine. The pretrial order specified that the plaintiffs would call her as an \"expert in neonatology regarding her review of the pertinent records, the standards of care within her field of expertise applicable to this case, the defendants' departures from such standards, about [G.P.P.'s] condition and the causal relationship between said condition and the defendants' departures.\" Upon Ramírez-González's motion, the parties conducted a <i>Daubert</i> inquiry outside the presence of the jury into Dr. Crawford's credentials. <i>See </i><i>Daubert,</i> 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469. At that hearing, Dr. Crawford was asked to elaborate on her qualifications, which we summarize here.</p>\n<p>After obtaining her medical degree, Dr. Crawford completed a pediatric residency followed by a fellowship in neonatal-perinatal medicine. She is board certified in neonatal-perinatal medicine. As a specialist in neonatal-perinatal medicine, Dr. Crawford deals with \"problems during pregnancy, labor, and delivery that [a]ffect [the baby].\" She served for several years as the medical director of the Southern New Jersey Perinatal Cooperative. In that role, she developed a statewide educational program called Perinatal Emergencies. Her team presented a \"standard of care, that is the appropriate thing to do in such a situation. For instance, with fetal monitoring, that when uterine hyper stimulation occurs, that you did a number of things. You turn off the Pitocin. You give fluids, oxygen, change position. Subsequently, we recommended that [terbutaline], which is a uterine relaxation drug, be considered to relax the uterus, allow better blood flow and oxygen to the fetus; and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> that the patient be evaluated for a timely delivery.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Crawford has written chapters for several published medical books. Most relevantly, she authored a chapter on fetal asphyxia, which covers the administration of Pitocin, and a chapter entitled, \"Differential Diagnosis of Respiratory Distress,\" which was intended \"to help physicians understand when they have a baby that wasn't breathing or a baby that had breathing problems how to differentiate what the cause of those were.\"</p>\n<p>Although Dr. Crawford does not perform c-sections, she has served as a consultant in high-risk deliveries and \"set the wheels in motion\" when she determined that a c-section was indicated. Thus, she \"can identify the problems and prepare the patient.\" She has been \"trained to identify ominous patterns on a fetal monitor and to evaluate whether the patient is likely to be able to deliver quickly vaginally or whether a cesarean section will be needed.\" She also conducts peer review evaluations of unexpected outcomes after delivery. Such review involves taking into account \"the obstetrical care, the obstetrical nursing care, the delivery care, the neonatal management.\" Dr. Crawford has previously been qualified to testify on departures from the standard of care in obstetrics in both state and federal cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. The Decision to Limit Dr. Crawford's Testimony</h2>\n<p>After hearing the evidence outlined above, the district court issued an order precluding Dr. Crawford from providing \"her opinion as to obstetrical standards of care, departures from these standards, or causation in this case.\" The court agreed with Ramírez-González's argument that \"because Dr. Crawford's experience and training is not in obstetrics and gynecology, she cannot provide expert testimony regarding the alleged departures in the standards of care committed by Defendant [], an obstetrician-gynecologist.\" Citing Dr. Crawford's lack of board certification in obstetrics and gynecology and her statement that it is typically an obstetrician/gynecologist who \"makes the final decisions regarding a woman in labor,\" the court ruled that Dr. Crawford would not be permitted to \"testify as to the events that occurred before and during the cesarean section,\" and that she could not \"provide any testimony pertaining to the cause of [G.P.P.]'s injuries.\" Dr. Crawford proceeded to testify only about G.P.P's medical conditions and the testing that he underwent immediately following his birth.</p>\n<p>We review a trial court's decision to admit or exclude expert testimony for abuse of discretion. <i>Gaydar,</i> 345 F.3d at 24. A \"district court enjoys substantial discretion to decide whether to admit or exclude relevant expert testimony.\" <i>Mitchell,</i> 141 F.3d at 14. As we described above, the judge's task is to ensure that the expert's testimony \"`both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.'\" <i>Mooney,</i> 315 F.3d at 62 (quoting <i>Daubert,</i> 509 U.S. at 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786). In carrying out this responsibility, the trial court must bear in mind that an expert with appropriate credentials and an appropriate foundation for the opinion at issue must be permitted to present testimony as long as the testimony has a \"tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Fed.R.Evid. 401. An unduly restrictive review of the relevant expertise of a physician is incompatible with what we have characterized as a liberal standard of relevance. <i>Mitchell,</i> 141 F.3d at 14 (quoting <i>Daubert,</i> 509 U.S. at 587, 113 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*116</span> 2786) (noting that Rule 401's \"`basic standard of relevance [] is a liberal one'\").</p>\n<p>In light of these standards, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to permit Dr. Crawford to testify on the relevant standard of care and causation. The court mistakenly relied on Dr. Crawford's lack of board certification in obstetrics and gynecology to preclude her from testifying. In its Opinion and Order granting Ramírez-González's motion for judgment as a matter of law, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote>Dr. Crawford testified that she was not board-certified in OB/GYN, and that she had no privileges to administer [P]itocin to a patient or to perform a cesarean section. She further testified that although she serves as a consultant at high-risk[] births, it is the OB/GYN who actually delivers the baby and makes the final decisions regarding the delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Accordingly, the Court rule[s] that Dr. Crawford's testimony be limited to exclude any testimony regarding OB/GYN standards of care, departures from OB/ GYN standards of care, and causation.</blockquote>\n<p>The court thus found that because Dr. Crawford herself is not certified to administer Pitocin or perform c-sections, she would not be qualified to opine on the alleged departures from the standards of care committed by Ramírez-González, an obstetrician-gynecologist.</p>\n<p>That logic is flawed. The dispositive question is not whether an expert is board certified in a particular medical specialty. Rather, the Rules of Evidence require that the judge admit expert testimony relevant to the disposition of the case when it will assist the trier of fact in understanding a fact in issue and rests on a reliable foundation. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 702; <i>Mooney,</i> 315 F.3d at 62; <i>Gaydar,</i> 345 F.3d at 24.</p>\n<p>Dr. Crawford's credentials easily meet and, indeed, surpass the standard for admissibility of expert testimony. She is board-certified in, and practices, perinatal and neonatal medicine. As enumerated above, she has published book chapters that deal with the administration of Pitocin. She has served as a consultant at high-risk deliveries and has recommended that c-sections be performed. She conducts peer review evaluations that involve taking into account the obstetrical and delivery care that a patient is given, and she has worked on guidelines for responding to perinatal emergencies. She has \"scientific, technical, [and] other specialized knowledge\" that \"will assist the trier better to understand a fact in issue.\" <i>Gaydar,</i> 345 F.3d at 24 (citation omitted). Her knowledge \"rests on a reliable foundation,\" <i>Mooney,</i> 315 F.3d at 62, i.e., her medical education and many years of experience in the field. Her testimony is \"relevant to the task at hand.\" <i>Id.</i> Indeed, without Dr. Crawford's testimony on causation and the standard of care, the plaintiffs were unable to present evidence on two elements of their case.</p>\n<p>Trying to defend the district court's ruling on a different ground, Ramírez-González argues that, whether or not she was properly credentialed to serve as an expert, Dr. Crawford's testimony was correctly excluded because the plaintiffs did not disclose her prior to the trial as an expert in the appropriate standard of care and causation. In making this argument, Ramírez-González attempts to analogize the district court's limitation on Dr. Crawford's testimony in this case to the district court's preclusion of expert testimony that we recently upheld in <i>Martínez-Serrano v. Quality Health Services of Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> 568 F.3d 278 (1st Cir.2009). In that case, the plaintiffs \"attempted to reformulate their theory of liability (and, thus, dramatically shift the focus of their expert's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*117</span> opinion testimony).\" <i>Id.</i> at 283. We found that the substantive change in the opinion being offered by an expert for the plaintiffs amounted to a failure to meet the district court's deadline for \"identification of experts and the disclosure of their opinions.\" <i>Id.</i> We refused to find an abuse of discretion when the trial court precluded that expert from offering testimony because of the untimeliness of the disclosure of his opinions. <i>Id.</i> at 284. We noted that \"the plaintiffs had flouted a clearly expressed discovery deadline without any apparent justification and under circumstances redolent of strategic behavior.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Ramírez-González's effort to cast the events in this case into the mold of <i>Martínez-Serrano</i> is unavailing. Although there may be some merit to Ramírez-González's contention that Dr. Nathanson was to be the plaintiffs' principal witness on causation and the standard of care, the record shows that Dr. Crawford was set to testify on those issues as well. The pretrial order stated that Dr. Crawford would \"testify as an expert in neonatology regarding her review of the pertinent records, the standards of care within her field of expertise applicable to this case, the defendants' departures from such standards, about [G.P.P.]'s condition as it relates to her field of expertise, and the estimated cost of his life care.\"<sup>[4]</sup> Moreover, her report, which was provided to Ramírez-González well in advance of the trial,<sup>[5]</sup> dealt extensively with G.P.P.'s treatment and concluded with a section entitled, \"Causation: Opinions.\" There is no support in the record for Ramírez-González's claim that he would have been surprised and unfairly prejudiced if Dr. Crawford had been allowed to testify on the standard of care and causation.<sup>[6]</sup> Moreover, it is noteworthy that the district court does not mention a failure to disclose the substance of Dr. Crawford's testimony in its opinion and order limiting Dr. Crawford's testimony. It is clear that the district court instead based its decision to limit Dr. Crawford's testimony on its erroneous assessment of her credentials after hearing her testify in the <i>Daubert</i> hearing.</p>\n<p>Judgment vacated. Remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Costs are awarded to the appellants.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Ramírez-González has a medical malpractice policy issued by Insurers Syndicate for the Joint Underwriting of Medical-Hospital Professional Liability Insurance (SIMED). SIMED is also a named defendant in this action.</p>\n<p>[2]  The plaintiffs are residents of Orlando, Florida. The defendant is a resident of Puerto Rico, where the events described in the complaint occurred. The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(2).</p>\n<p>[3]  Perinatology is the branch of medicine concerned with the care of the mother and fetus during pregnancy, labor, and delivery. Neonatology is the branch of medicine concerned with the care, development, and diseases of newborn infants.</p>\n<p>[4]  Although this reference to neonatology, viewed in isolation, might suggest that Dr. Crawford was only going to testify about the care and development of G.P.P. after his birth, the actual description of the scope of Dr. Crawford's testimony and the substance of the section of her report entitled, \"Causation: Opinions,\" <i>see infra</i> n. 6, made it abundantly clear that her proposed testimony would not be limited to the field of neonatology.</p>\n<p>[5]  The report was attached as an exhibit in support of the plaintiffs' opposition to the defendant's motion for summary judgment and added to the docket in March 2008, three months prior to the trial.

After the plaintiffs presented their case-in-chief to a jury, the district court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of Ramírez-González. The Court concluded that the plaintiffs' evidence was insufficient to establish two elements of a medical malpractice claim: a departure from the relevant standard of care and a causal relationship between the departure and the harm to their son.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the district court committed reversible error when it made several evidentiary rulings that resulted in the exclusion of expert testimony. Because we agree that the district court improperly limited the testimony of one of the plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Carolyn Crawford, we vacate the judgment for Ramírez-González and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Background</h2>\n<p>Consistent with the applicable standard of review for a judgment as a matter of law, we recite the relevant facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. <i>See </i><i>EnergyNorth Natural Gas, Inc., v. Century Indem. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794719\"><a href=\"/opinion/794719/energynorth-natural-gas-inc-successor-in-interest-to-gas-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 46 (1st Cir. 2006). Defendant, Dr. Antonio Ramírez-González,<sup>[1]</sup> was plaintiff Dilma Pagés-Ramírez's physician during her pregnancy with G.P.P. and attended at his birth. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*112</span> Pagés-Ramírez visited Dr. Ramírez-González on at least seven occasions for prenatal care during her pregnancy. She was expected to deliver on or around June 1, 2005.</p>\n<p>On May 19, 2005, Pagés-Ramírez arrived at Hospital Auxilio Mutuo in active labor. When her labor did not progress over the next few hours, she received intravenous Pitocin, a drug used to increase the frequency of contractions, her water was artificially broken, and an epidural anaesthetic was begun. When Pagés-Ramírez was fully dilated, an attempt was made to use vacuum extraction to deliver G.P.P. That attempt was unsuccessful. Ramírez-González eventually delivered G.P.P. by cesarean section (\"c-section\").</p>\n<p>After the delivery, Pagés-Ramírez required the transfusion of four units of blood. She remained hospitalized until May 24, 2005. G.P.P. was in critical condition when he was delivered. He remained in intensive care until August 5, 2005, when he was discharged to another hospital where he continued to receive treatment for brain damage and physical abnormalities. G.P.P.'s current prognosis is bleak. He has permanent brain damage and has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Due to organ damage, he must be fed through a tube in his abdominal wall. Those conditions are not expected to improve over time.</p>\n<p>On May 11, 2007, Pagés-Ramírez brought this suit in federal district court along with her husband, Michael Pietri Pozzi, on behalf of themselves and G.P.P. (collectively \"the plaintiffs\"), alleging that medical malpractice by Ramírez-González and Hospital Español Auxilio Mutuo de Puerto Rico caused catastrophic injury to G.P.P.<sup>[2]</sup> Early in the litigation, the plaintiffs reached a confidential settlement with the hospital and its insurer, Admiral Insurance Company.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' remaining malpractice claims against Ramírez-González alleged, specifically, that Ramírez-González departed from the standard of care by, among other things, failing to elicit a comprehensive obstetrical history from Pagés-Ramírez, failing to estimate G.P.P.'s fetal weight and to enter it into the delivery record, attempting a mid-pelvic delivery by vacuum extraction, failing to use an internal fetal heart monitor, and failing to timely call for a c-section delivery. The plaintiffs claimed that those deviations from the standard of care resulted in profound multi-organ damage to G.P.P., as well as respiratory failure, sepsis, asphyxia and seizures. They further alleged that they have suffered emotional anguish as a result of the trauma to G.P.P., and that, due to their limited economic resources, G.P.P. has not been able to receive sufficient medical care or therapy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Trial</h2>\n<p>Trial by jury began on May 1, 2008. The plaintiffs proposed to call three medical expert witnesses as part of their case-in-chief. One of those experts, an obstetrician, failed to appear because of illness, and the trial court ruled that his deposition testimony could not be admitted into evidence in his absence. When the plaintiffs called their next two medical experts, a specialist in neonatal/perinatal medicine<sup>[3]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> and a neurologist, the court limited the testimony of each one, ruling that the doctors were not qualified to offer testimony on either the appropriate standard of care for an obstetrician in Ramírez-González's position, or on the issue of whether any deviations from the standard of care caused the injuries to G.P.P.</p>\n<p>Predictably, when the plaintiffs had finished presenting their case, the court had to grant Ramírez-González's motion for judgment as a matter of law. Without the testimony of their missing expert and with their two remaining medical experts precluded from testifying on the standard of care and causation, the plaintiffs did not have enough evidence to support their claims.</p>\n<p>Although the plaintiffs contest all of the abovementioned evidentiary rulings on appeal, we focus here on the court's ruling that the plaintiffs' expert in neonatal and perinatal medicine, Dr. Carolyn Crawford, would not be permitted to offer testimony on the standard of care and causation. As we explain, that erroneous ruling alone requires a new trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Elements of Medical Malpractice</h2>\n<p>This diversity suit is governed by the substantive law of Puerto Rico. <i>See </i><i>Marcano Rivera v. Turbado Med. Ctr.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201706\"><a href=\"/opinion/201706/marcano-rivera-v-roldan-millan/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, 167 (1st Cir.2005). In Puerto Rico, as in many jurisdictions, in order to prevail on a medical malpractice claim, \"a party must establish (1) the duty owed; (2) an act or omission transgressing that duty; and (3) a sufficient causal nexus between the breach and the harm.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted). In the context of medical malpractice actions, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has explained that a physician's duty is \"to offer his or her patient that medical care, attention, skill, and protection that, in the light of the modern means of communication and education, and pursuant to the current status of scientific knowledge and medical practice, meets the professional requirements generally acknowledged by the medical profession.\" <i>Santiago Otero v. Méndez,</i> 1994 P.R.-Eng. 909,224, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">909224</span></span> (1994). To prevail, a plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence both that the standard of care was not met, and that the failure to meet an acceptable standard caused the harm. <i>Id.</i> In order to determine the applicable standard of care in a medical malpractice action and to make a judgment on causation, a trier of fact will generally need the assistance of expert testimony. <i>See </i><i>Rojas-Ithier v. Sociedad Espanola de Auxilio Mutuo y Beneficiencia de P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201404\"><a href=\"/opinion/201404/rojas-ithier-v-sociedad-espanola/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.2005) (citing <i>Rolon-Alvarado v.

Admission of Expert Testimony</h2>\n<p>The admission of expert testimony is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 702. Rule 702 requires that expert testimony be (1) \"based upon sufficient facts or data,\" (2) \"the product of reliable principles and methods,\" and (3) that the witness apply \"the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\" We have described the trial judge as the gatekeeper in applying Rule 702's admissibility criteria. <i>Gaydar v. Sociedad Instituto Gineco-Quirurgico y Planificacion Familiar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200666\"><a href=\"/opinion/200666/gaydar-v-sociedad-instituto/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.2003). The judge must decide \"whether the scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge [the expert] offers `will assist the trier better to understand a fact in issue.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Alzanki,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196113\"><a href=\"/opinion/196113/united-states-v-alzanki/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></a></span>, 1005 (1st Cir.1995)). The judge must ensure that an expert's testimony \"`both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.'\" <i>United States v. Mooney,</i> 315 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Daubert v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span> (1993)). As part of its inquiry, the trial court must \"determine whether the putative expert is qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education,\" to offer testimony. <i>Mitchell v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197865\"><a href=\"/opinion/197865/mitchell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1998) (citation omitted). We have explained, however, that \"[t]he proffered expert physician need not be a specialist in a particular medical discipline to render expert testimony relating to that discipline.\" <i>Gaydar,</i> 345 F.3d at 24.</p>\n<p>In <i>Mitchell,</i> we held that an expert, an internist with a specialty in hematology and oncology, was qualified to opine on the standard of care that should have been met by a gastroenterologist performing a colonoscopy. 141 F.3d at 15. Similarly, in <i>Gaydar,</i> we found that \"the mere fact that [an expert] was not a gynecologist does not mean that he was not qualified to give expert testimony regarding [the plaintiff's] pregnancy.\" 345 F.3d at 24.</p>\n<p>Although credentials such as board certification in a particular medical specialty may indicate that an expert's opinion is \"entitled to greater weight,\" such certification has \"never been held a prerequisite to qualification as an expert medical witness.\" <i>Alvarado v. Weinberger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"325610\"><a href=\"/opinion/325610/sofia-alvarado-v-caspar-w-weinberger-secretary-of-health-education-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1046</span></a></span>, 1049 (1st Cir.1975) (per curiam). Indeed, we have noted that it would be an abuse of discretion to exclude testimony that would otherwise \"assist the trier better to understand a fact in issue,\" simply because the expert does not have the specialization that the court considers most appropriate. <i>Gaydar,</i> 345 F.3d at 24-25 (citing <i>Holbrook v. Lykes Bros. S.S. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715786\"><a href=\"/opinion/715786/grace-a-holbrook-administratrix-of-the-estate-of-john-p-holbrook-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span>, 782 (3d Cir.1996) (finding an abuse of discretion when the trial judge prohibited physician specializing in internal medicine from opining on plaintiff's cancer because he was not an oncologist)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Dr. Crawford's Credentials</h2>\n<p>Dr. Carolyn Crawford is a specialist in pediatrics and neonatal and perinatal medicine. The pretrial order specified that the plaintiffs would call her as an \"expert in neonatology regarding her review of the pertinent records, the standards of care within her field of expertise applicable to this case, the defendants' departures from such standards, about [G.P.P.'s] condition and the causal relationship between said condition and the defendants' departures.\" Upon Ramírez-González's motion, the parties conducted a <i>Daubert</i> inquiry outside the presence of the jury into Dr. Crawford's credentials. <i>See </i><i>Daubert,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span>. At that hearing, Dr. Crawford was asked to elaborate on her qualifications, which we summarize here.</p>\n<p>After obtaining her medical degree, Dr. Crawford completed a pediatric residency followed by a fellowship in neonatal-perinatal medicine. She is board certified in neonatal-perinatal medicine. As a specialist in neonatal-perinatal medicine, Dr. Crawford deals with \"problems during pregnancy, labor, and delivery that [a]ffect [the baby].\" She served for several years as the medical director of the Southern New Jersey Perinatal Cooperative. In that role, she developed a statewide educational program called Perinatal Emergencies. Her team presented a \"standard of care, that is the appropriate thing to do in such a situation. For instance, with fetal monitoring, that when uterine hyper stimulation occurs, that you did a number of things. You turn off the Pitocin. You give fluids, oxygen, change position. Subsequently, we recommended that [terbutaline], which is a uterine relaxation drug, be considered to relax the uterus, allow better blood flow and oxygen to the fetus; and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> that the patient be evaluated for a timely delivery.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Crawford has written chapters for several published medical books. Most relevantly, she authored a chapter on fetal asphyxia, which covers the administration of Pitocin, and a chapter entitled, \"Differential Diagnosis of Respiratory Distress,\" which was intended \"to help physicians understand when they have a baby that wasn't breathing or a baby that had breathing problems how to differentiate what the cause of those were.\"</p>\n<p>Although Dr. Crawford does not perform c-sections, she has served as a consultant in high-risk deliveries and \"set the wheels in motion\" when she determined that a c-section was indicated. Thus, she \"can identify the problems and prepare the patient.\" She has been \"trained to identify ominous patterns on a fetal monitor and to evaluate whether the patient is likely to be able to deliver quickly vaginally or whether a cesarean section will be needed.\" She also conducts peer review evaluations of unexpected outcomes after delivery. Such review involves taking into account \"the obstetrical care, the obstetrical nursing care, the delivery care, the neonatal management.\" Dr. Crawford has previously been qualified to testify on departures from the standard of care in obstetrics in both state and federal cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. The Decision to Limit Dr. Crawford's Testimony</h2>\n<p>After hearing the evidence outlined above, the district court issued an order precluding Dr. Crawford from providing \"her opinion as to obstetrical standards of care, departures from these standards, or causation in this case.\" The court agreed with Ramírez-González's argument that \"because Dr. Crawford's experience and training is not in obstetrics and gynecology, she cannot provide expert testimony regarding the alleged departures in the standards of care committed by Defendant [], an obstetrician-gynecologist.\" Citing Dr. Crawford's lack of board certification in obstetrics and gynecology and her statement that it is typically an obstetrician/gynecologist who \"makes the final decisions regarding a woman in labor,\" the court ruled that Dr. Crawford would not be permitted to \"testify as to the events that occurred before and during the cesarean section,\" and that she could not \"provide any testimony pertaining to the cause of [G.P.P.]'s injuries.\" Dr. Crawford proceeded to testify only about G.P.P's medical conditions and the testing that he underwent immediately following his birth.</p>\n<p>We review a trial court's decision to admit or exclude expert testimony for abuse of discretion. <i>Gaydar,</i> 345 F.3d at 24. A \"district court enjoys substantial discretion to decide whether to admit or exclude relevant expert testimony.\" <i>Mitchell,</i> 141 F.3d at 14. As we described above, the judge's task is to ensure that the expert's testimony \"`both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.'\" <i>Mooney,</i> 315 F.3d at 62 (quoting <i>Daubert,</i> 509 U.S. at 597, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2786</span></a></span>). In carrying out this responsibility, the trial court must bear in mind that an expert with appropriate credentials and an appropriate foundation for the opinion at issue must be permitted to present testimony as long as the testimony has a \"tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Fed.R.Evid. 401. An unduly restrictive review of the relevant expertise of a physician is incompatible with what we have characterized as a liberal standard of relevance. <i>Mitchell,</i> 141 F.3d at 14 (quoting <i>Daubert,</i> 509 U.S. at 587, 113 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*116</span> 2786) (noting that Rule 401's \"`basic standard of relevance [] is a liberal one'\").</p>\n<p>In light of these standards, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to permit Dr. Crawford to testify on the relevant standard of care and causation. The court mistakenly relied on Dr. Crawford's lack of board certification in obstetrics and gynecology to preclude her from testifying. In its Opinion and Order granting Ramírez-González's motion for judgment as a matter of law, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote>Dr. Crawford testified that she was not board-certified in OB/GYN, and that she had no privileges to administer [P]itocin to a patient or to perform a cesarean section. She further testified that although she serves as a consultant at high-risk[] births, it is the OB/GYN who actually delivers the baby and makes the final decisions regarding the delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Accordingly, the Court rule[s] that Dr. Crawford's testimony be limited to exclude any testimony regarding OB/GYN standards of care, departures from OB/ GYN standards of care, and causation.</blockquote>\n<p>The court thus found that because Dr. Crawford herself is not certified to administer Pitocin or perform c-sections, she would not be qualified to opine on the alleged departures from the standards of care committed by Ramírez-González, an obstetrician-gynecologist.</p>\n<p>That logic is flawed. The dispositive question is not whether an expert is board certified in a particular medical specialty. Rather, the Rules of Evidence require that the judge admit expert testimony relevant to the disposition of the case when it will assist the trier of fact in understanding a fact in issue and rests on a reliable foundation. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 702; <i>Mooney,</i> 315 F.3d at 62; <i>Gaydar,</i> 345 F.3d at 24.</p>\n<p>Dr. Crawford's credentials easily meet and, indeed, surpass the standard for admissibility of expert testimony. She is board-certified in, and practices, perinatal and neonatal medicine. As enumerated above, she has published book chapters that deal with the administration of Pitocin. She has served as a consultant at high-risk deliveries and has recommended that c-sections be performed. She conducts peer review evaluations that involve taking into account the obstetrical and delivery care that a patient is given, and she has worked on guidelines for responding to perinatal emergencies. She has \"scientific, technical, [and] other specialized knowledge\" that \"will assist the trier better to understand a fact in issue.\" <i>Gaydar,</i> 345 F.3d at 24 (citation omitted). Her knowledge \"rests on a reliable foundation,\" <i>Mooney,</i> 315 F.3d at 62, i.e., her medical education and many years of experience in the field. Her testimony is \"relevant to the task at hand.\" <i>Id.</i> Indeed, without Dr. Crawford's testimony on causation and the standard of care, the plaintiffs were unable to present evidence on two elements of their case.</p>\n<p>Trying to defend the district court's ruling on a different ground, Ramírez-González argues that, whether or not she was properly credentialed to serve as an expert, Dr. Crawford's testimony was correctly excluded because the plaintiffs did not disclose her prior to the trial as an expert in the appropriate standard of care and causation. In making this argument, Ramírez-González attempts to analogize the district court's limitation on Dr. Crawford's testimony in this case to the district court's preclusion of expert testimony that we recently upheld in <i>Martínez-Serrano v. Quality Health Services of Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203859\"><a href=\"/opinion/203859/martinez-serrano-v-quality-health-serv-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2009). In that case, the plaintiffs \"attempted to reformulate their theory of liability (and, thus, dramatically shift the focus of their expert's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*117</span> opinion testimony).\" <i>Id.</i> at 283. We found that the substantive change in the opinion being offered by an expert for the plaintiffs amounted to a failure to meet the district court's deadline for \"identification of experts and the disclosure of their opinions.\" <i>Id.</i> We refused to find an abuse of discretion when the trial court precluded that expert from offering testimony because of the untimeliness of the disclosure of his opinions. <i>Id.</i> at 284. We noted that \"the plaintiffs had flouted a clearly expressed discovery deadline without any apparent justification and under circumstances redolent of strategic behavior.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Ramírez-González's effort to cast the events in this case into the mold of <i>Martínez-Serrano</i> is unavailing. Although there may be some merit to Ramírez-González's contention that Dr. Nathanson was to be the plaintiffs' principal witness on causation and the standard of care, the record shows that Dr. Crawford was set to testify on those issues as well. The pretrial order stated that Dr. Crawford would \"testify as an expert in neonatology regarding her review of the pertinent records, the standards of care within her field of expertise applicable to this case, the defendants' departures from such standards, about [G.P.P.]'s condition as it relates to her field of expertise, and the estimated cost of his life care.\"<sup>[4]</sup> Moreover, her report, which was provided to Ramírez-González well in advance of the trial,<sup>[5]</sup> dealt extensively with G.P.P.'s treatment and concluded with a section entitled, \"Causation: Opinions.\" There is no support in the record for Ramírez-González's claim that he would have been surprised and unfairly prejudiced if Dr. Crawford had been allowed to testify on the standard of care and causation.<sup>[6]</sup> Moreover, it is noteworthy that the district court does not mention a failure to disclose the substance of Dr. Crawford's testimony in its opinion and order limiting Dr. Crawford's testimony. It is clear that the district court instead based its decision to limit Dr. Crawford's testimony on its erroneous assessment of her credentials after hearing her testify in the <i>Daubert</i> hearing.</p>\n<p>Judgment vacated. Remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Costs are awarded to the appellants.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Ramírez-González has a medical malpractice policy issued by Insurers Syndicate for the Joint Underwriting of Medical-Hospital Professional Liability Insurance (SIMED). SIMED is also a named defendant in this action.</p>\n<p>[2]  The plaintiffs are residents of Orlando, Florida. The defendant is a resident of Puerto Rico, where the events described in the complaint occurred. The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(2).</p>\n<p>[3]  Perinatology is the branch of medicine concerned with the care of the mother and fetus during pregnancy, labor, and delivery. Neonatology is the branch of medicine concerned with the care, development, and diseases of newborn infants.</p>\n<p>[4]  Although this reference to neonatology, viewed in isolation, might suggest that Dr. Crawford was only going to testify about the care and development of G.P.P. after his birth, the actual description of the scope of Dr. Crawford's testimony and the substance of the section of her report entitled, \"Causation: Opinions,\" <i>see infra</i> n. 6, made it abundantly clear that her proposed testimony would not be limited to the field of neonatology.</p>\n<p>[5]  The report was attached as an exhibit in support of the plaintiffs' opposition to the defendant's motion for summary judgment and added to the docket in March 2008, three months prior to the trial. As such, it was served on defendant.</p>\n<p>[6]  In the section of her report entitled \"Causation: Opinions,\" Dr. Crawford wrote, among other things:\n</p>\n<p>Pitocin was used indiscriminately resulting in uterine hyperstimulation and impaired teroplacental perfusion which depleted his fetal reserves. The abnormal labor pattern for a multigravida was not appreciated. ...</p>\n<p>The records do not indicate any awareness that [G.P.P.] was such a big baby and the prenatal records were silent in terms of fundal height. ... Vacuum use was inappropriate and traumatic adding further insult to injury and resulted in a prolonged (32 minute) bradycardia. The [c-section] was delayed which contributed to the profound acidosis and CNS insult that he sustained.</p>\n\n</div>",
