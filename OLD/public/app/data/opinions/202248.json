Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Cyr and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Edward S. MacColl, with whom Thompson, Bull, Furey, Bass &\nMacColl, LLC, P.A. was on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          June 7, 2006\n\f               CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.     Defendant Kurt H. Thompson\n\nchallenges the district court order convicting him of conspiring to\n\ndistribute and possess with intent to distribute 500 or more grams\n\nof cocaine. See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B)(ii), 846. We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                       I\n\n                                 BACKGROUND\n\n               In 2003, Justin Canney began purchasing large supplies of\n\nhigh-purity, uncut cocaine from Jason Higgins in New York for\n\nresale in Maine.        Defendant Thompson soon began purchasing from\n\nfive to twenty ounces of cocaine per week from Canney, which he\n\nresold to his own customers, whom he identified, inter alia, as\n\n“Jared,” “Dan,” and Frank Cicero, who was also a customer of\n\nCanney’s.       Cicero in turn resold the cocaine he acquired from\n\nCanney and Thompson to his own clients.           Subsequently, however,\n\nCicero and Thompson had an argument, and Cicero informed Canney\n\nthat he henceforth would purchase cocaine only from him, and not\n\nfrom Thompson.      Eventually Canney asked Thompson to “cut” the pure\n\ncocaine (viz., add fillers to increase the volume and the street\n\nvalue of the drug) which Canney received from New York, because\n\nCanney was worried that his live-in girlfriend might discover his\n\ndrug dealing.       Canney’s illicit activities eventually became the\n\nfocus     of    a   United   States   Drug    Enforcement   Agency   (DEA)\n\ninvestigation, during which his house and person were placed under\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fsurveillance.\n\n            In May 2004, Canney sold Thompson two and one-half ounces\n\nof pure cocaine, and asked that Thompson return it to him \"cut,\"\n\nfor resale to Cicero.        On May 3, Thompson arrived at the Canney\n\nresidence with five ounces of cut cocaine.             Canney concealed the\n\ncocaine in a false-bottom cannister, and he and Thompson drove away\n\nin Canney’s car to deliver the drugs to Cicero.                     After Canney\n\ncommitted    several    traffic    violations,      the    police,     who   were\n\ncooperating with the DEA investigation, stopped the vehicle and\n\nwith Canney’s consent, performed a limited search of the vehicle.\n\nNo incriminating evidence was disclosed.             As planned, the police\n\nthen   allowed   Canney   and     Thompson   to    drive   off,     followed      by\n\nundercover DEA agents.       Immediately, Canney made several evasive\n\ndriving maneuvers, drove to a vacant lot, and placed several cell\n\nphone calls.\n\n            In   due   course,    Canney     and   Thompson    stopped       at   a\n\nrestaurant   for    lunch.      Undercover    agents      managed    to   station\n\nthemselves near the Canney and Thompson table, and overheard their\n\nconversation.      Thompson stated that he was “freaked out” by the\n\ntraffic stop, and when Canney told Thompson how to dispose of\n\ncocaine quickly (viz., dissolving it in water), Thompson stated\n\nthat he had “tucked” the evidence during the traffic stop.                    Upon\n\nexiting the restaurant, Canney and Thompson were placed in custody.\n\nThompson was found to have $3000 in cash.\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f           After questioning Canney and Thompson, the DEA agents\n\ndecided to arrest Canney, but released Thompson due to insufficient\n\nevidence that he had been involved in the ongoing drug distribution\n\nengaged in by Canney.       Canney eventually entered into a plea\n\nagreement to testify as to Higgins’ and Thompson’s participation in\n\nCanney's drug enterprise.    The government sent Thompson a target\n\nletter, and on July 2, 2004, Thompson was arrested, and later\n\nindicted on one count of conspiring to distribute and possess, with\n\nintent to distribute, 500 grams or more of cocaine, see 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B)(ii), 846.        Following a two-day jury\n\ntrial, Thompson was found guilty.      He now appeals from the ensuing\n\njudgment of conviction.\n\n                                 II\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\nA.   The Fifth Amendment Claim\n\n           Thompson contends that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying the motion for mistrial made after DEA\n\nSpecial Agent Wolf testified that, following Thompson’s arrest,\n\n“[Thompson] declined to make much of any statement.”         Thompson\n\nmaintains that Wolf’s testimony constituted an improper and unfair\n\ncomment on Thompson’s Fifth Amendment right not to be compelled to\n\nbe a witness against himself.\n\n           During direct examination, the government asked Agent\n\nWolf:   “And what is it that [defendant] told you back at the police\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fstation?”     Wolf    answered:    “He   declined      to   make    much   of   any\n\nstatement other than . . .”        The district court sustained defense\n\ncounsel’s    objection,    and    Wolf   continued      with    his   testimony.\n\nGovernment counsel then asked:           “Did [defendant] say anything to\n\nyou?” Wolf responded: “That they [Thompson and Canney] were going\n\nto meet Cicero.”      Wolf then testified as to Canney’s comments and\n\nactions on May 3, 2004.      Only then did defense counsel move for a\n\nmistrial or for a cautionary instruction based on Wolf’s comment\n\nthat Thompson had “declined to make much of any statement.”                     The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion for mistrial, agreed to give a\n\ncautionary instruction, but warned defense counsel that such an\n\ninstruction might cause the jury to focus on Wolf’s comment more\n\nthan it had already done so.         Defense counsel advised the court\n\nthat the defense did not want the curative instruction.\n\n            The defendant has a constitutional right to remain silent\n\nfollowing arrest, and it is inappropriate for the government\n\nintentionally to make or solicit comments concerning a defendant's\n\nexercise of that right.      See Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609,\n\n615 (1965); United States v. Figueroa-Encarnacion, 343 F.3d 23, 33\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).      Any such comment improperly invites the jury to\n\ninfer from the defendant’s silence that he had something to hide.\n\nWhen a defendant challenges such a comment, the district court must\n\ninquire “‘(w)hether the language used was manifestly intended or\n\nwas   of   such   a   character   that    the   jury    would      naturally    and\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fnecessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused\n\nto testify.’”           Id. (citation omitted).           Where the comment is\n\nambiguous, however, we will not lightly infer either that the\n\ngovernment intended, or that the jury necessarily drew, the most\n\nprejudicial meaning. See United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 979\n\n(1st Cir. 1995); United States v. Lilly, 983 F.2d 300, 307 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).       Moreover, even if we were to respond to such a query\n\nin the affirmative, we would not reverse where the government\n\ndemonstrates that the comment was harmless beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.     See United States v. Mooney, 315 F.3d 54, 61 (1st Cir.\n\n2002);    Lilly,    983    F.2d   at    308-09    (noting    that    new   trial     is\n\nwarranted only “where ‘the offending conduct so poisoned the well\n\nthat     the    trial’s     outcome      was     likely     affected’      or    when,\n\nalternatively, ‘the breach was so egregious that reversal becomes\n\na   desirable       sanction       to    forestall        future     prosecutorial\n\ntrespasses’”)      (citation      omitted).       Finally,     pertinent        to   the\n\nharmless-error analysis would be, inter alia, “‘the severity of the\n\nmisconduct, whether it was deliberate or accidental, the context in\n\nwhich it occurred, the likely curative effect of the judge’s\n\nadmonitions       and    the   strength     of    the     evidence    against        the\n\ndefendant.’”       Id. at 308 (citation omitted).\n\n               We conclude that the district court committed no manifest\n\nabuse of discretion in denying the Thompson motion for mistrial.\n\nSee United States v. Rullan-Rivera, 60 F.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1995);\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fLilly, 983 F.2d at 308 (noting that district court is in better\n\nvantage   to   determine   if   any   harm   resulting   from   the   comment\n\nnecessitates mistrial).         “[R]emarks must be examined in context\n\nrather than in isolation in order to ascertain if Fifth Amendment\n\nconcerns are implicated.”       Id. at 307.    Here, there is no evidence\n\nthat the prosecutor intentionally solicited the Wolf comment.              In\n\nfact, since the prosecutor had asked Wolf what Thompson had told\n\nhim at the police station, Wolf’s answer was non-responsive.\n\nFurther, Wolf did not state that Thompson refused to make a\n\nstatement, but that he did not make “much” of a statement.                See\n\nKibbe v. DuBois, 269 F.3d 26, 38-39 (1st Cir. 2001) (noting case\n\nlaw holding that in some circumstances, once defendant waives his\n\nright to remain silent and makes a statement, it may be permissible\n\nto comment on what statements he did not make).          Before Wolf could\n\nelaborate, however, the district court sustained defense counsel’s\n\nobjection.     No further comment was made on the matter.        See Lilly,\n\n983 F.2d at 307 (noting that improper comment was less likely to\n\ncause harm where it was an “isolated instance” during a long\n\ntrial).\n\n           Several minutes later, defense counsel abruptly moved for\n\na mistrial,1 and the district court offered to give a curative\n\n\n     1\n      The unexplained delay in moving for mistrial suggests that\ndefense counsel initially did not view the Wolf comment as so\nprejudicial that it warranted a new trial. Unless the defendant\nlodges a contemporaneous objection, rarely will we infer that a\ncomment was unduly prejudicial. See Taylor, 54 F.3d at 979.\n\n                                      -7-\n\finstruction.     See United States v. Freeman, 208 F.3d 332, 339 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (“Where ‘a curative instruction is promptly given, a\n\nmistrial is warranted only in rare circumstances implying extreme\n\nprejudice.’”) (citation omitted); United States v. Sepulveda, 15\n\nF.3d 1161, 1184 (1st Cir. 1993) (“[C]ourts have long recognized\n\nthat, within wide margins, the potential for prejudice stemming\n\nfrom improper testimony or comments can be satisfactorily dispelled\n\nby appropriate curative instructions.”); cf. Mooney, 315 F.3d at 61\n\n(noting that improper comment on defendant’s silence was cured by\n\nemphatic and prompt curative instruction); Lilly, 983 F.2d at 308\n\n(same).   Defense counsel voluntarily declined this offer after the\n\ncourt cautioned that an instruction might invite the jury to focus\n\non the Wolf comment more than it had when the comment was made.\n\nSee United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 446 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(“The level of prejudice, if any, was not sufficiently significant\n\nto overturn the judge's decision to accept the defendants’ tactical\n\nchoice    to   forgo   more   appropriate   methods    of   addressing     the\n\npotential prejudice in favor of the unrealistic and unnecessary\n\nsolution of a dismissal or a new trial.”).            In its final charge,\n\nthe   district   court   emphatically     instructed    the   jury   on    the\n\npresumption of innocence and the government’s burden to prove the\n\nalleged offense beyond a reasonable doubt (e.g., “The law does not\n\ncompel any defendant in a criminal case to take the witness stand\n\nand testify.       No presumption of guilt may be raised             and    no\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\finference of any kind may be drawn from the fact that Kurt Thompson\n\ndid not testify.         For any of you to indulge such an inference or\n\nsuggestion would be most improper.”), see Mooney, 315 F.3d at 61;\n\nTaylor, 54 F.3d at 980; United States v. Turner, 892 F.2d 11, 13-14\n\n(1st Cir. 1989), and we normally presume that juries follow their\n\ninstructions,      see   Sepulveda,        15    F.3d   at   1185.     We     therefore\n\nconclude    that   the    district       court     permissibly       found    that   the\n\nprosecutor did not intentionally solicit the Wolf comment and that\n\nit was not “of such a character that the jury would naturally and\n\nnecessarily take it to be comment on the failure of the accused to\n\ntestify.”    Figueroa-Encarnacion, 343 F.3d at 33.\n\n            In any event, the government’s case against Thompson was\n\nremarkably strong.           See Taylor, 54 F.3d at 980 (relying on the\n\n“potency    of     the    government’s           proof,”     where    testimony      was\n\n“unequivocal and corroborated on many points,” in concluding that\n\nprosecutor’s comments were not prejudicial).                    To cite but a few\n\nexamples, Canney testified in detail about his multiple drug\n\ntransactions with Thompson during 2003 and 2004, about Thompson’s\n\nagreement to \"cut\" the cocaine supplies, and that Thompson was\n\nreselling    his      cocaine      to   customers       including     Frank    Cicero.\n\nCanney’s live-in girlfriend testified that Canney and Thompson\n\nfrequently associated, and that she once observed cocaine inside\n\nThompson’s Dodge Truck.            Law enforcement agents attested to their\n\nsurveillance     on    May    3,   2004,    including        Thompson’s      suspicious\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fbehavior and incriminating remarks prior to his detention, to the\n\ndrugs and other incriminating evidence seized in the searches of\n\nthe Canney car and home, and to the discovery that Thompson was\n\ncarrying $3000 in cash at the time he was detained.            Thus, even if\n\nwe were to assume, arguendo, that the Wolf comment adverted to\n\nThompson’s exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights, that comment was\n\nisolated in context, the court afforded defendant an adequate\n\nremedy which he freely declined, and the government’s case vastly\n\noutweighed any potential for prejudice.\n\nB.   The Co-conspirator Statements\n\n           Next, Thompson contends that the district court erred in\n\nadmitting into evidence – as a statement made by Thompson’s co-\n\nconspirator under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E) – Frank\n\nCicero’s comment to Canney that he now wanted to buy his drugs only\n\nfrom Canney because Cicero and Thompson had had a falling out.\n\nThompson   maintains   that   the   Cicero   statement    is    inadmissible\n\nhearsay since the government did not present any evidence that he\n\nand Cicero were co-conspirators, or that Cicero made the statement\n\n“in furtherance of the conspiracy,” and that Cicero instead stated\n\nthat he no longer wanted to be associated with Thompson.\n\n           District court rulings admitting evidence under Rule\n\n801(d)(2)(E) are reviewed only for clear error.          See United States\n\nv. Castellini, 392 F.3d 35, 50 (1st Cir. 2004).                Following the\n\nprocedures set forth in United States v. Ciampaglia, 628 F.2d 632,\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f638 (1st Cir. 1980), the district court provisionally admitted the\n\nCicero statement.        At the close of all the evidence, the district\n\ncourt       explicitly   ruled    that    the   government    had     shown   by   a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the Cicero statement met all\n\nrequirements       of    Rule    801(d)(2)(E).       See     United    States      v.\n\nPetrozziello, 548 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1977) (requiring that court\n\nmake explicit findings that it is “more likely than not that the\n\ndeclarant and the defendant were members of a conspiracy . . . and\n\nthat the statement was in furtherance of the conspiracy”).\n\n               First, Thompson never raised the argument below that the\n\nCicero statement was inadmissible on the ground that the government\n\nfailed to prove that Thompson and Cicero were members of the same\n\nconspiracy.       Consequently, it is forfeited on appeal.             See United\n\nStates v. Paradis, 351 F.3d 21, 28 n.6 (1st Cir. 2003).2                  Second,\n\nthe Cicero statement “furthered” the conspiracy in that it placed\n\nCanney on notice that two of his co-conspirators – Thompson and\n\nCicero – no longer intended to deal directly with one another.\n\nCicero did not state his intention to withdraw from the extant\n\nconspiracy, however, nor was it essential to their status as co-\n\nconspirators that he and Thompson continue to maintain direct\n\ncontact with one another.          See United States v. Soto-Beniquez, 356\n\n\n        2\n      The Thompson forfeiture is hardly a surprise, given the trial\nevidence that Canney, Thompson, and Cicero were all drug sellers\nwith a common source of supply (viz., Higgins in New York), and\nthat Canney and Thompson were on their way to deliver cocaine to\nCicero on the day of their arrest.\n\n                                         -11-\n\fF.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir. 2003) (“The government need not show that each\n\nconspirator knew of or had contact with all other members.”), cert.\n\ndenied, 541 U.S. 1074 (2004).    The district court thus made all the\n\nnecessary findings of fact required by Petrozziello, none of which\n\nare clearly erroneous.     Consequently, it acted well within its\n\ndiscretion    in   admitting    the   Cicero   statement   under   Rule\n\n801(d)(2)(E).\n\nC.   The Co-conspirator’s Guilty Plea\n\n            Thompson next contends that the district court erred in\n\nallowing the government to introduce, in its case in chief, the\n\nfact that Canney and Higgins had entered a guilty plea to the\n\nconspiracy charge, and in not providing a cautionary instruction\n\nthat the jury should only consider the evidence as it pertained to\n\nthe credibility of Canney and Higgins, not to Thompson’s guilt.\n\n            Thompson incorrectly states that the court did not give\n\na limiting instruction.   In its final charge, the court stated: “As\n\nfor the guilty pleas of Jason Higgins and Justin Canney, you may\n\nconsider their respective pleas in assessing their individual\n\ncredibility, but you must not consider those guilty pleas as any\n\nevidence against Kurt Thompson.”      As Thompson lodged no objection\n\nto the admission of this evidence, but instead elicited the same\n\nevidence during cross-examination to attack the credibility of the\n\ngovernment’s witnesses, we find no error in its admission in\n\nevidence.    See United States v. Dworkin, 855 F.2d 12, 30 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f1988) (noting that evidence of witness’s guilty pleas is admissible\n\nto “dampen the effect of an anticipated attack on the witness’s\n\ncredibility,” provided jury is so instructed); see also United\n\nStates v. Sullivan, 85 F.3d 743, 749 (1st Cir. 1996) (finding “no\n\nplain error in admitting certain testimony when, among other\n\nproblems, the testimony was elicited by defense counsel on cross-\n\nexamination”) (citation omitted).\n\nD.     The Anonymous Letter\n\n               Next,     Thompson    contends       that    the    district   court\n\nerroneously admitted in evidence – as Thompson’s own incriminating\n\nstatement – an anonymous handwritten letter Canney received in jail\n\none week after his May 3 arrest, since the government failed to\n\nadduce evidence (e.g., a handwriting expert) that the letter was in\n\nfact sent by Thompson.\n\n               We discern no abuse of discretion in the admission of\n\nthis    letter.         “Anonymous    correspondence        may    be   sufficiently\n\ndistinctive      in     its    ‘appearance,    contents,     substance,    internal\n\npatterns or other distinctive characteristics,’ within the meaning\n\nof     Fed.    R.      Evid.    901(b)(4),     to    meet    the    authentication\n\nrequirement.” United States v. Bello-Perez, 977 F.2d 664, 671 (1st\n\nCir. 1992); United States v. Ingraham, 832 F.2d 229, 236 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).        A document need not be signed or proven to be in the\n\ndefendant’s handwriting to be authenticated.                See Bello-Perez, 977\n\nF.2d at 671; United States v. McMahon, 938 F.2d 1501, 1508-09 (1st\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fCir. 1991) (noting that authentication of unsigned note may be\n\nbased on circumstantial indicia of authorship).\n\n           The anonymous letter’s content precisely fits Thompson’s\n\ncircumstances and predicament in May 2004.             Coming only one week\n\nafter the Thompson and Canney joint arrests, the letter’s author\n\nstated that “the target letter they gave me still has me losing\n\nsleep at night,” a plain reference to the target letter sent to\n\nThompson   after   Canney    admitted,     to    law     enforcement   agents,\n\nThompson’s complicity in his drug distribution.             See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n901, advisory committee note example (4) (noting that a document\n\n“may be shown to have emanated from a particular person by virtue\n\nof its disclosing knowledge of facts known peculiarly to him”).\n\nThe author stated that “they let me go . . . because I didn’t say\n\nanything,” a clear reference to the fact that Thompson was released\n\nfrom custody after his arrest on May 3, 2004 for lack of evidence,\n\nwhereas Canney was not.\n\n           Finally, Canney testified that he recognized the return\n\naddress, provided in the letter, as Thompson’s residence.               See 5\n\nJack B. Weinstein and Margaret A. Burger, Weinstein's Evidence ¶\n\n901(b)(4)[02], at 901-67 (1991) (noting that “return address” is\n\nvalid indicium for authentication purposes).             Given these internal\n\nindicia,   the   district   court   did    not   abuse    its   discretion   in\n\nadmitting the letter into evidence as a statement of the defendant.\n\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 901(a) (noting that authentication of evidence\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f“is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the\n\nmatter in question is what its proponent claims”).\n\nF.    The Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           Finally, Thompson contends that the district court erred\n\nin   denying    his   motion    for   judgment      of   acquittal    because    the\n\ngovernment proved at most that he and Canney had a mere seller-\n\nbuyer relationship, which is insufficient to establish a drug\n\nconspiracy, see United States v. Gore, 154 F.3d 34, 40 (1st Cir.\n\n1998),   and    did    not     establish      the    requisite    conspiratorial\n\n“agreement” or “meeting of minds.”\n\n           We review de novo the denial of a motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal.      See United States v. Hatch, 434 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).   Viewing the evidence and credibility determinations in the\n\nlight most favorable to the verdict, we simply inquire whether a\n\nreasonable factfinder could have found defendant guilty beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.      See id.\n\n           The government was required to establish that Thompson\n\nagreed with Canney and others, albeit tacitly, to commit the\n\nsubstantive crime of cocaine distribution, that this was the object\n\nof their agreement, and that Thompson knowingly and voluntarily\n\nparticipated in the conspiracy.            See United States v. Santiago, 83\n\nF.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1996).          This is not a close question.\n\n           The government adduced ample evidence that Thompson and\n\nCanney   were    involved      in   much   more     than   a   mere   one-time   or\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\ftransitory   seller-buyer           relationship.       In   distinguishing     a\n\nconspiracy   from      a   mere     vendor-vendee      arrangement,   the    core\n\nconsideration     is       “whether      the    evidence     surrounding      the\n\ntransaction(s) is sufficient to allow a fairminded jury to find\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that A knew that B was reselling the\n\ndrugs, and intended to facilitate the resales.”              Id. at 24.     During\n\ntheir extended relationship, Thompson purchased for resale a total\n\nof 4 kilos of cocaine from Canney, and Thompson expressly told\n\nCanney that he was reselling it to his own clients, including Frank\n\nCicero.   Thompson cut the cocaine for Canney and for himself.                 On\n\nMay 3, 2004, Thompson and Canney were on their way to deliver drugs\n\nto Cicero. Subsequent searches uncovered large quantities of drugs\n\nand cash, thus confirming that this joint drug distribution network\n\nwas entrenched, and most definitely not a one-time, small-scale\n\nsales transaction.         We accordingly conclude that the government\n\nadduced   more   than      enough    evidence   that    Thompson   “agreed”    to\n\nconspire with Canney and others in a cocaine distribution scheme.\n\nConsequently, we affirm the jury verdict.3\n\n\n     3\n      Thompson also argues that the district court erred in\nallowing the government to adduce evidence that his Dodge Truck had\na license plate which read “DIRRTY,” because that evidence was\nirrelevant and unfairly prejudicial. As he did not object to this\nevidence in the district court, we review only for plain error.\nSee United States v. Vazquez-Rivera, 407 F.3d 476, 483 (1st Cir.),\ncert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 279 (2005). We find none. The government\noffered the evidence to show that Thompson drove his girlfriend’s\nvehicle when engaging in drug-related business, since her vehicle\nhad a less conspicuous license plate, and Thompson wanted to avoid\ndrawing attention.\n\n                                        -16-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -17-\n\f",

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">* <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2003, Justin Canney began purchasing large supplies of high-purity, uncut cocaine from Jason Higgins in New York for resale in Maine. Defendant Thompson soon began purchasing from five to twenty ounces of cocaine per week from Canney, which he resold to his own customers, whom he identified, <i>inter alia,</i> as \"Jared,\" \"Dan,\" and Frank Cicero, who was also a customer of Canney's. Cicero in turn resold the cocaine he acquired from Canney and Thompson to his own clients. Subsequently, however, Cicero and Thompson had an argument, and Cicero informed Canney that he henceforth would purchase cocaine only from him, and not from Thompson. Eventually Canney asked Thompson to \"cut\" the pure cocaine (<i>viz.,</i> add fillers to increase the volume and the street value of the drug) which Canney received from New York, because Canney was worried that his live-in girlfriend might discover his drug dealing. Canney's illicit activities eventually became the focus of a United States Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) investigation, during which his house and person were placed under surveillance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2004, Canney sold Thompson two and one-half ounces of pure cocaine, and asked that Thompson return it to him \"cut,\" for resale to Cicero. On May 3, Thompson arrived at the Canney residence with five ounces of cut cocaine. Canney concealed the cocaine in a false-bottom cannister, and he and Thompson drove away in Canney's car to deliver the drugs to Cicero. After Canney committed several traffic violations, the police, who were cooperating with the DEA investigation, stopped the vehicle and with Canney's consent, performed a limited search of the vehicle. No incriminating evidence was disclosed. As planned, the police then allowed Canney and Thompson to drive off, followed by undercover DEA agents. Immediately, Canney made several evasive driving maneuvers, drove to a vacant lot, and placed several cell phone calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Canney and Thompson stopped at a restaurant for lunch. Undercover agents managed to station themselves near the Canney and Thompson table, and overheard their conversation. Thompson stated that he was \"freaked out\" by the traffic stop, and when Canney told Thompson how to dispose of cocaine quickly (<i>viz.,</i> dissolving it in water), Thompson stated that he had \"tucked\" the evidence during the traffic stop. Upon exiting the restaurant, Canney and Thompson were placed in custody. Thompson was found to have $3000 in cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After questioning Canney and Thompson, the DEA agents decided to arrest Canney, but released Thompson due to insufficient evidence that he had been involved in the ongoing drug distribution engaged in by Canney. Canney eventually entered into a plea agreement to testify as to Higgins' and Thompson's participation in Canney's drug enterprise. The government sent Thompson a target letter, and on July 2, 2004, Thompson was arrested, and later indicted on one count of conspiring to distribute and possess, with intent to distribute, 500 grams or more of cocaine, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B)(ii), 846. Following a two-day jury trial, Thompson was found guilty. He now appeals from the ensuing judgment of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Fifth Amendment Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thompson contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for mistrial made after DEA Special Agent Wolf testified that, following Thompson's arrest, \"[Thompson] declined to make much of any statement.\" Thompson maintains that Wolf's testimony constituted an improper and unfair comment on Thompson's Fifth Amendment right not to be compelled to be a witness against himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During direct examination, the government asked Agent Wolf: \"And what is it that [defendant] told you back at the police station?\" Wolf answered: \"He declined to make much of any statement other than . . .\" The district court sustained defense counsel's objection, and Wolf continued with his testimony. Government counsel then asked: \"Did [defendant] say anything to you?\" Wolf responded: \"That they [Thompson and Canney] were going to meet Cicero.\" Wolf then testified as to Canney's comments and actions on May 3, 2004. Only then did defense counsel move for a mistrial or for a cautionary instruction based on Wolf's comment that Thompson had \"declined to make much of any statement.\" The district court denied the motion for mistrial, agreed to give a cautionary instruction, but warned defense counsel that such an instruction might cause the jury to focus on Wolf's comment more than it had already done so. Defense counsel advised the court that the defense did not want the curative instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant has a constitutional right to remain silent following arrest, and it is inappropriate for the government intentionally to make or solicit comments concerning a defendant's exercise of that right. <i>See Griffin v. California,</i> 380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965); <i>United States v. Figueroa-Encarnacion,</i> 343 F.3d 23, 33 (1st Cir.2003). Any such comment improperly invites the jury to infer from the defendant's silence that he had something to hide. When a defendant challenges such a comment, the district court must inquire \"`(w)hether the language used was manifestly intended or was of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.'\" <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted). Where the comment is ambiguous, however, we will not lightly infer either that the government intended, or that the jury necessarily drew, the most prejudicial meaning. <i>See United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 979 (1st Cir.1995); <i>United States v. Lilly,</i> 983 F.2d 300, 307 (1st Cir.1992). Moreover, even if we were to respond to such a query in the affirmative, we would not reverse where the government demonstrates that the comment was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See United States v. Mooney,</i> 315 F.3d 54, 61 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Lilly,</i> 983 F.2d at 308-09 (noting that new trial is warranted only \"where `the offending conduct so poisoned the well that the trial's outcome was likely affected' or when, alternatively, `the breach was so egregious that reversal becomes a desirable sanction to forestall future prosecutorial trespasses'\") (citation omitted). Finally, pertinent to the harmless-error analysis would be, <i>inter alia,</i> \"`the severity of the misconduct, whether it was deliberate or accidental, the context in which it occurred, the likely curative effect of the judge's admonitions and the strength of the evidence against the defendant.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 308 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the district court committed no manifest abuse of discretion in denying the Thompson motion for mistrial. <i>See United States v. Rullan-Rivera,</i> 60 F.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir.1995); <i>Lilly,</i> 983 F.2d at 308 (noting that district court is in better vantage to determine if any harm resulting from the comment necessitates mistrial). \"[R]emarks must be examined in context rather than in isolation in order to ascertain if Fifth Amendment concerns are implicated.\" <i>Id.</i> at 307. Here, there is no evidence that the prosecutor intentionally solicited the Wolf comment. In fact, since the prosecutor had asked Wolf what Thompson had told him at the police station, Wolf's answer was non-responsive. Further, Wolf did not state that Thompson refused to make a statement, but that he did not make \"much\" of a statement. <i>See Kibbe v. DuBois,</i> 269 F.3d 26, 38-39 (1st Cir.2001) (noting case law holding that in some circumstances, once defendant waives his right to remain silent and makes a statement, it may be permissible to comment on what statements he did not make). Before Wolf could elaborate, however, the district court sustained defense counsel's objection. No further comment was made on the matter. <i>See Lilly,</i> 983 F.2d at 307 (noting that improper comment was less likely to cause harm where it was an \"isolated instance\" during a long trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several minutes later, defense counsel abruptly moved for a mistrial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and the district court offered to give a curative instruction. <i>See United States v. Freeman,</i> 208 F.3d 332, 339 (1st Cir.2000) (\"Where `a curative instruction is promptly given, a mistrial is warranted only in rare circumstances implying <i>extreme prejudice.</i>'\") (citation omitted); <i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1184 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"[C]ourts have long recognized that, within wide margins, the potential for prejudice stemming from improper testimony or comments can be satisfactorily dispelled by appropriate curative instructions.\"); <i>cf. Mooney,</i> 315 F.3d at 61 (noting that improper comment on defendant's silence was cured by emphatic and prompt curative instruction); <i>Lilly,</i> 983 F.2d at 308 (same). Defense counsel voluntarily declined this offer after the court cautioned that an instruction might invite the jury to focus on the Wolf comment more than it had when the comment was made. <i>See United States v. Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d 409, 446 (1st Cir.1994) (\"The level of prejudice, if any, was not sufficiently significant to overturn the judge's decision to accept the defendants' tactical choice to forgo more appropriate methods of addressing the potential prejudice in favor of the unrealistic and unnecessary solution of a dismissal or a new trial.\"). In its final charge, the district court emphatically instructed the jury on the presumption of innocence and the government's burden to prove the alleged offense beyond a reasonable doubt (<i>e.g.,</i> \"The law does not compel any defendant in a criminal case to take the witness stand and testify. No presumption of guilt may be raised and no inference of any kind may be drawn from the fact that Kurt Thompson did not testify. For any of you to indulge such an inference or suggestion would be most improper.\"), <i>see Mooney,</i> 315 F.3d at 61; <i>Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 980; <i>United States v. Turner,</i> 892 F.2d 11, 13-14 (1st Cir.1989), and we normally presume that juries follow their instructions, <i>see Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1185. We therefore conclude that the district court permissibly found that the prosecutor did not intentionally solicit the Wolf comment and that it was not \"of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\" <i>Figueroa-Encarnacion,</i> 343 F.3d at 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the government's case against Thompson was remarkably strong. <i>See Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 980 (relying on the \"potency of the government's proof,\" where testimony was \"unequivocal and corroborated on many points,\" in concluding that prosecutor's comments were not prejudicial). To cite but a few examples, Canney testified in detail about his multiple drug transactions with Thompson during 2003 and 2004, about Thompson's agreement to \"cut\" the cocaine supplies, and that Thompson was reselling his cocaine to customers including Frank Cicero. Canney's live-in girlfriend testified that Canney and Thompson frequently associated, and that she once observed cocaine inside Thompson's Dodge Truck. Law enforcement agents attested to their surveillance on May 3, 2004, including Thompson's suspicious behavior and incriminating remarks prior to his detention, to the drugs and other incriminating evidence seized in the searches of the Canney car and home, and to the discovery that Thompson was carrying $3000 in cash at the time he was detained. Thus, even if we were to assume, <i>arguendo,</i> that the Wolf comment adverted to Thompson's exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights, that comment was isolated in context, the court afforded defendant an adequate remedy which he freely declined, and the government's case vastly outweighed any potential for prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Co-conspirator Statements</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Thompson contends that the district court erred in admitting into evidence&#8212;as a statement made by Thompson's co-conspirator under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E)&#8212;Frank Cicero's comment to Canney that he now wanted to buy his drugs only from Canney because Cicero and Thompson had had a falling out. Thompson maintains that the Cicero statement is inadmissible hearsay since the government did not present any evidence that he and Cicero were co-conspirators, or that Cicero made the statement \"in furtherance of the conspiracy,\" and that Cicero instead stated that he no longer wanted to be associated with Thompson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">District court rulings admitting evidence under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) are reviewed only for clear error. <i>See United States v. Castellini,</i> 392 F.3d 35, 50 (1st Cir.2004). Following the procedures set forth in <i>United States v. Ciampaglia,</i> 628 F.2d 632, 638 (1st Cir.1980), the district court provisionally admitted the Cicero statement. At the close of all the evidence, the district court explicitly ruled that the government had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the Cicero statement met all requirements of Rule 801(d)(2)(E). <i>See United States v. Petrozziello,</i> 548 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir.1977) (requiring that court make explicit findings that it is \"more likely than not that the declarant and the defendant were members of a conspiracy . . . and that the statement was in furtherance of the conspiracy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Thompson never raised the argument below that the Cicero statement was inadmissible on the ground that the government failed to prove that Thompson and Cicero were members of the same conspiracy. Consequently, it is forfeited on appeal. <i>See United States v. Paradis,</i> 351 F.3d 21, 28 n. 6 (1st Cir.2003).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Second, the Cicero statement \"furthered\" the conspiracy in that it placed Canney on notice that two of his co-conspirators&#8212; Thompson and Cicero&#8212;no longer intended to deal directly with one another. Cicero did not state his intention to withdraw from the extant conspiracy, however, nor was it essential to their status as co-conspirators that he and Thompson continue to maintain direct contact with one another. <i>See United States v. Soto-Beniquez,</i> 356 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir.2003) (\"The government need not show that each conspirator knew of or had contact with all other members.\"), <i>cert. denied,</i> 541 U.S. 1074, 124 S.Ct. 2412, 2427, 158 L.Ed.2d 985 (2004). The district court thus made all the necessary findings of fact required by <i>Petrozziello,</i> none of which are clearly erroneous. Consequently, it acted well within its discretion in admitting the Cicero statement under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Co-conspirator's Guilty Plea</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thompson next contends that the district court erred in allowing the government to introduce, in its case in chief, the fact that Canney and Higgins had entered a guilty plea to the conspiracy charge, and in not providing a cautionary instruction that the jury should only consider the evidence as it pertained to the credibility of Canney and Higgins, not to Thompson's guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thompson incorrectly states that the court did not give a limiting instruction. In its final charge, the court stated: \"As for the guilty pleas of Jason Higgins and Justin Canney, you may consider their respective pleas in assessing their individual credibility, but you must not consider those guilty pleas as any evidence against Kurt Thompson.\" As Thompson lodged no objection to the admission of this evidence, but instead elicited the same evidence during cross-examination to attack the credibility of the government's witnesses, we find no error in its admission in evidence. <i>See United States v. Dworken,</i> 855 F.2d 12, 30 (1st Cir.1988) (noting that evidence of witness's guilty pleas is admissible to \"dampen the effect of an anticipated attack on the witness's credibility,\" provided jury is so instructed); <i>see also United States v. Sullivan,</i> 85 F.3d 743, 749 (1st Cir.1996) (finding \"no plain error in admitting certain testimony when, among other problems, the testimony was elicited by defense counsel on cross-examination\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>The Anonymous Letter</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Thompson contends that the district court erroneously admitted in evidence&#8212;as Thompson's own incriminating statement&#8212;an anonymous handwritten letter Canney received in jail one week after his May 3 arrest, since the government failed to adduce evidence (<i>e.g.,</i> a handwriting expert) that the letter was in fact sent by Thompson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no abuse of discretion in the admission of this letter. \"Anonymous correspondence may be sufficiently distinctive in its `appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns or other distinctive characteristics,' within the meaning of Fed. R.Evid. 901(b)(4), to meet the authentication requirement.\" <i>United States v. Bello-Perez,</i> 977 F.2d 664, 671 (1st Cir.1992); <i>United States v. Ingraham,</i> 832 F.2d 229, 236 (1st Cir.1987). A document need not be signed or proven to be in the defendant's handwriting to be authenticated. <i>See Bello-Perez,</i> 977 F.2d at 671; <i>United States v. McMahon,</i> 938 F.2d 1501, 1508-09 (1st Cir.1991) (noting that authentication of unsigned note may be based on circumstantial indicia of authorship).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The anonymous letter's content precisely fits Thompson's circumstances and predicament in May 2004. Coming only one week after the Thompson and Canney joint arrests, the letter's author stated that \"the target letter they gave me still has me losing sleep at night,\" a plain reference to the target letter sent to Thompson after Canney admitted, to law enforcement agents, Thompson's complicity in his drug distribution. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 901, advisory committee note example (4) (noting that a document \"may be shown to have emanated from a particular person by virtue of its disclosing knowledge of facts known peculiarly to him\"). The author stated that \"they let me go . . . because I didn't say anything,\" a clear reference to the fact that Thompson was released from custody after his arrest on May 3, 2004 for lack of evidence, whereas Canney was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Canney testified that he recognized the return address, provided in the letter, as Thompson's residence. <i>See</i> 5 Jack B. Weinstein and Margaret A. Burger, <i>Weinstein's Evidence</i> &#182; 901(b)(4)[02], at 901-67 (1991) (noting that \"return address\" is valid indicium for authentication purposes). Given these internal indicia, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the letter into evidence as a statement of the defendant. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 901(a) (noting that authentication of evidence \"is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. <i>The Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Thompson contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because the government proved at most that he and Canney had a mere seller-buyer relationship, which is insufficient to establish a drug conspiracy, <i>see United States v. Gore,</i> 154 F.3d 34, 40 (1st Cir.1998), and did not establish the requisite conspiratorial \"agreement\" or \"meeting of minds.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal. <i>See United States v. Hatch,</i> 434 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2006). Viewing the evidence and credibility determinations in the light most favorable to the verdict, we simply inquire whether a reasonable factfinder could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government was required to establish that Thompson agreed with Canney and others, albeit tacitly, to commit the substantive crime of cocaine distribution, that this was the object of their agreement, and that Thompson knowingly and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy. <i>See United States v. Santiago,</i> 83 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir.1996). This is not a close question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government adduced ample evidence that Thompson and Canney were involved in much more than a mere one-time or transitory seller-buyer relationship. In distinguishing a conspiracy from a mere vendor-vendee arrangement, the core consideration is \"whether the evidence surrounding the transaction(s) is sufficient to allow a fairminded jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that A knew that B was reselling the drugs, and intended to facilitate the resales.\" <i>Id.</i> at 24. During their extended relationship, Thompson purchased for resale a total of 4 kilos of cocaine from Canney, and Thompson expressly told Canney that he was reselling it to his own clients, including Frank Cicero. Thompson cut the cocaine for Canney and for himself. On May 3, 2004, Thompson and Canney were on their way to deliver drugs to Cicero. Subsequent searches uncovered large quantities of drugs and cash, thus confirming that this joint drug distribution network was entrenched, and most definitely not a one-time, small-scale sales transaction. We accordingly conclude that the government adduced more than enough evidence that Thompson \"agreed\" to conspire with Canney and others in a cocaine distribution scheme. Consequently, we affirm the jury verdict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The unexplained delay in moving for mistrial suggests that defense counsel initially did not view the Wolf comment as so prejudicial that it warranted a new trial.

Defendant Thompson soon began purchasing from five to twenty ounces of cocaine per week from Canney, which he resold to his own customers, whom he identified, <i>inter alia,</i> as \"Jared,\" \"Dan,\" and Frank Cicero, who was also a customer of Canney's. Cicero in turn resold the cocaine he acquired from Canney and Thompson to his own clients. Subsequently, however, Cicero and Thompson had an argument, and Cicero informed Canney that he henceforth would purchase cocaine only from him, and not from Thompson. Eventually Canney asked Thompson to \"cut\" the pure cocaine (<i>viz.,</i> add fillers to increase the volume and the street value of the drug) which Canney received from New York, because Canney was worried that his live-in girlfriend might discover his drug dealing. Canney's illicit activities eventually became the focus of a United States Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) investigation, during which his house and person were placed under surveillance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2004, Canney sold Thompson two and one-half ounces of pure cocaine, and asked that Thompson return it to him \"cut,\" for resale to Cicero. On May 3, Thompson arrived at the Canney residence with five ounces of cut cocaine. Canney concealed the cocaine in a false-bottom cannister, and he and Thompson drove away in Canney's car to deliver the drugs to Cicero. After Canney committed several traffic violations, the police, who were cooperating with the DEA investigation, stopped the vehicle and with Canney's consent, performed a limited search of the vehicle. No incriminating evidence was disclosed. As planned, the police then allowed Canney and Thompson to drive off, followed by undercover DEA agents. Immediately, Canney made several evasive driving maneuvers, drove to a vacant lot, and placed several cell phone calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Canney and Thompson stopped at a restaurant for lunch. Undercover agents managed to station themselves near the Canney and Thompson table, and overheard their conversation. Thompson stated that he was \"freaked out\" by the traffic stop, and when Canney told Thompson how to dispose of cocaine quickly (<i>viz.,</i> dissolving it in water), Thompson stated that he had \"tucked\" the evidence during the traffic stop. Upon exiting the restaurant, Canney and Thompson were placed in custody. Thompson was found to have $3000 in cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After questioning Canney and Thompson, the DEA agents decided to arrest Canney, but released Thompson due to insufficient evidence that he had been involved in the ongoing drug distribution engaged in by Canney. Canney eventually entered into a plea agreement to testify as to Higgins' and Thompson's participation in Canney's drug enterprise. The government sent Thompson a target letter, and on July 2, 2004, Thompson was arrested, and later indicted on one count of conspiring to distribute and possess, with intent to distribute, 500 grams or more of cocaine, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B)(ii), 846. Following a two-day jury trial, Thompson was found guilty. He now appeals from the ensuing judgment of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Fifth Amendment Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thompson contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for mistrial made after DEA Special Agent Wolf testified that, following Thompson's arrest, \"[Thompson] declined to make much of any statement.\" Thompson maintains that Wolf's testimony constituted an improper and unfair comment on Thompson's Fifth Amendment right not to be compelled to be a witness against himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During direct examination, the government asked Agent Wolf: \"And what is it that [defendant] told you back at the police station?\" Wolf answered: \"He declined to make much of any statement other than . . .\" The district court sustained defense counsel's objection, and Wolf continued with his testimony. Government counsel then asked: \"Did [defendant] say anything to you?\" Wolf responded: \"That they [Thompson and Canney] were going to meet Cicero.\" Wolf then testified as to Canney's comments and actions on May 3, 2004. Only then did defense counsel move for a mistrial or for a cautionary instruction based on Wolf's comment that Thompson had \"declined to make much of any statement.\" The district court denied the motion for mistrial, agreed to give a cautionary instruction, but warned defense counsel that such an instruction might cause the jury to focus on Wolf's comment more than it had already done so. Defense counsel advised the court that the defense did not want the curative instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant has a constitutional right to remain silent following arrest, and it is inappropriate for the government intentionally to make or solicit comments concerning a defendant's exercise of that right. <i>See Griffin v.

Any such comment improperly invites the jury to infer from the defendant's silence that he had something to hide. When a defendant challenges such a comment, the district court must inquire \"`(w)hether the language used was manifestly intended or was of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.'\" <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted). Where the comment is ambiguous, however, we will not lightly infer either that the government intended, or that the jury necessarily drew, the most prejudicial meaning. <i>See United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 979 (1st Cir.1995); <i>United States v.

Moreover, even if we were to respond to such a query in the affirmative, we would not reverse where the government demonstrates that the comment was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See United States v.

Finally, pertinent to the harmless-error analysis would be, <i>inter alia,</i> \"`the severity of the misconduct, whether it was deliberate or accidental, the context in which it occurred, the likely curative effect of the judge's admonitions and the strength of the evidence against the defendant.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 308 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the district court committed no manifest abuse of discretion in denying the Thompson motion for mistrial. <i>See United States v.

Here, there is no evidence that the prosecutor intentionally solicited the Wolf comment. In fact, since the prosecutor had asked Wolf what Thompson had told him at the police station, Wolf's answer was non-responsive. Further, Wolf did not state that Thompson refused to make a statement, but that he did not make \"much\" of a statement. <i>See Kibbe v. DuBois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199642\"><a href=\"/opinion/199642/kibbe-v-dubois/\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 38-39 (1st Cir.2001) (noting case law holding that in some circumstances, once defendant waives his right to remain silent and makes a statement, it may be permissible to comment on what statements he did not make). Before Wolf could elaborate, however, the district court sustained defense counsel's objection. No further comment was made on the matter. <i>See Lilly,</i> 983 F.2d at 307 (noting that improper comment was less likely to cause harm where it was an \"isolated instance\" during a long trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several minutes later, defense counsel abruptly moved for a mistrial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and the district court offered to give a curative instruction. <i>See United States v.

Mooney,</i> 315 F.3d at 61 (noting that improper comment on defendant's silence was cured by emphatic and prompt curative instruction); <i>Lilly,</i> 983 F.2d at 308 (same). Defense counsel voluntarily declined this offer after the court cautioned that an instruction might invite the jury to focus on the Wolf comment more than it had when the comment was made. <i>See United States v.

In its final charge, the district court emphatically instructed the jury on the presumption of innocence and the government's burden to prove the alleged offense beyond a reasonable doubt (<i>e.g.,</i> \"The law does not compel any defendant in a criminal case to take the witness stand and testify. No presumption of guilt may be raised and no inference of any kind may be drawn from the fact that Kurt Thompson did not testify. For any of you to indulge such an inference or suggestion would be most improper.\"), <i>see Mooney,</i> 315 F.3d at 61; <i>Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 980; <i>United States v. Turner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533862\"><a href=\"/opinion/533862/united-states-v-james-e-turner/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 13-14 (1st Cir.1989), and we normally presume that juries follow their instructions, <i>see Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1185. We therefore conclude that the district court permissibly found that the prosecutor did not intentionally solicit the Wolf comment and that it was not \"of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\" <i>Figueroa-Encarnacion,</i> 343 F.3d at 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the government's case against Thompson was remarkably strong. <i>See Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 980 (relying on the \"potency of the government's proof,\" where testimony was \"unequivocal and corroborated on many points,\" in concluding that prosecutor's comments were not prejudicial). To cite but a few examples, Canney testified in detail about his multiple drug transactions with Thompson during 2003 and 2004, about Thompson's agreement to \"cut\" the cocaine supplies, and that Thompson was reselling his cocaine to customers including Frank Cicero. Canney's live-in girlfriend testified that Canney and Thompson frequently associated, and that she once observed cocaine inside Thompson's Dodge Truck. Law enforcement agents attested to their surveillance on May 3, 2004, including Thompson's suspicious behavior and incriminating remarks prior to his detention, to the drugs and other incriminating evidence seized in the searches of the Canney car and home, and to the discovery that Thompson was carrying $3000 in cash at the time he was detained. Thus, even if we were to assume, <i>arguendo,</i> that the Wolf comment adverted to Thompson's exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights, that comment was isolated in context, the court afforded defendant an adequate remedy which he freely declined, and the government's case vastly outweighed any potential for prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Co-conspirator Statements</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Thompson contends that the district court erred in admitting into evidence&#8212;as a statement made by Thompson's co-conspirator under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E)&#8212;Frank Cicero's comment to Canney that he now wanted to buy his drugs only from Canney because Cicero and Thompson had had a falling out. Thompson maintains that the Cicero statement is inadmissible hearsay since the government did not present any evidence that he and Cicero were co-conspirators, or that Cicero made the statement \"in furtherance of the conspiracy,\" and that Cicero instead stated that he no longer wanted to be associated with Thompson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">District court rulings admitting evidence under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) are reviewed only for clear error. <i>See United States v.

Ciampaglia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"381348\"><a href=\"/opinion/381348/united-states-v-paul-ciampaglia-united-states-of-america-v-william/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span>, 638 (1st Cir.1980), the district court provisionally admitted the Cicero statement. At the close of all the evidence, the district court explicitly ruled that the government had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the Cicero statement met all requirements of Rule 801(d)(2)(E). <i>See United States v. Petrozziello,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"342283\"><a href=\"/opinion/342283/united-states-v-ralph-petrozziello/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.1977) (requiring that court make explicit findings that it is \"more likely than not that the declarant and the defendant were members of a conspiracy . . . and that the statement was in furtherance of the conspiracy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Thompson never raised the argument below that the Cicero statement was inadmissible on the ground that the government failed to prove that Thompson and Cicero were members of the same conspiracy. Consequently, it is forfeited on appeal. <i>See United States v. Paradis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200733\"><a href=\"/opinion/200733/united-states-v-paradis/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 28 n. 6 (1st Cir.2003).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Second, the Cicero statement \"furthered\" the conspiracy in that it placed Canney on notice that two of his co-conspirators&#8212; Thompson and Cicero&#8212;no longer intended to deal directly with one another. Cicero did not state his intention to withdraw from the extant conspiracy, however, nor was it essential to their status as co-conspirators that he and Thompson continue to maintain direct contact with one another. <i>See United States v. Soto-Beniquez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784866\"><a href=\"/opinion/784866/united-states-v-william-soto-beniquez-united-states-of-america-v-juan/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2003) (\"The government need not show that each conspirator knew of or had contact with all other members.\"), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1074</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></span> (2004). The district court thus made all the necessary findings of fact required by <i>Petrozziello,</i> none of which are clearly erroneous. Consequently, it acted well within its discretion in admitting the Cicero statement under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Co-conspirator's Guilty Plea</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thompson next contends that the district court erred in allowing the government to introduce, in its case in chief, the fact that Canney and Higgins had entered a guilty plea to the conspiracy charge, and in not providing a cautionary instruction that the jury should only consider the evidence as it pertained to the credibility of Canney and Higgins, not to Thompson's guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thompson incorrectly states that the court did not give a limiting instruction. In its final charge, the court stated: \"As for the guilty pleas of Jason Higgins and Justin Canney, you may consider their respective pleas in assessing their individual credibility, but you must not consider those guilty pleas as any evidence against Kurt Thompson.\" As Thompson lodged no objection to the admission of this evidence, but instead elicited the same evidence during cross-examination to attack the credibility of the government's witnesses, we find no error in its admission in evidence. <i>See United States v. Dworken,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510631\"><a href=\"/opinion/510631/united-states-v-jay-lewis-dworken-aka-jason-lewis-jay-lewis-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.1988) (noting that evidence of witness's guilty pleas is admissible to \"dampen the effect of an anticipated attack on the witness's credibility,\" provided jury is so instructed); <i>see also United States v. Sullivan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196791\"><a href=\"/opinion/196791/united-states-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">743</span></a></span>, 749 (1st Cir.1996) (finding \"no plain error in admitting certain testimony when, among other problems, the testimony was elicited by defense counsel on cross-examination\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>The Anonymous Letter</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Thompson contends that the district court erroneously admitted in evidence&#8212;as Thompson's own incriminating statement&#8212;an anonymous handwritten letter Canney received in jail one week after his May 3 arrest, since the government failed to adduce evidence (<i>e.g.,</i> a handwriting expert) that the letter was in fact sent by Thompson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no abuse of discretion in the admission of this letter. \"Anonymous correspondence may be sufficiently distinctive in its `appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns or other distinctive characteristics,' within the meaning of Fed. R.Evid. 901(b)(4), to meet the authentication requirement.\" <i>United States v. Bello-Perez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593168\"><a href=\"/opinion/593168/united-states-v-andres-gabriel-bello-perez-aka-garby/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span>, 671 (1st Cir.1992); <i>United States v.

A document need not be signed or proven to be in the defendant's handwriting to be authenticated. <i>See Bello-Perez,</i> 977 F.2d at 671; <i>United States v. McMahon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564960\"><a href=\"/opinion/564960/united-states-v-charles-t-mcmahon/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1501</span></a></span>, 1508-09 (1st Cir.1991) (noting that authentication of unsigned note may be based on circumstantial indicia of authorship).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The anonymous letter's content precisely fits Thompson's circumstances and predicament in May 2004. Coming only one week after the Thompson and Canney joint arrests, the letter's author stated that \"the target letter they gave me still has me losing sleep at night,\" a plain reference to the target letter sent to Thompson after Canney admitted, to law enforcement agents, Thompson's complicity in his drug distribution. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 901, advisory committee note example (4) (noting that a document \"may be shown to have emanated from a particular person by virtue of its disclosing knowledge of facts known peculiarly to him\"). The author stated that \"they let me go . . . because I didn't say anything,\" a clear reference to the fact that Thompson was released from custody after his arrest on May 3, 2004 for lack of evidence, whereas Canney was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Canney testified that he recognized the return address, provided in the letter, as Thompson's residence. <i>See</i> 5 Jack B. Weinstein and Margaret A. Burger, <i>Weinstein's Evidence</i> &#182; 901(b)(4)[02], at 901-67 (1991) (noting that \"return address\" is valid indicium for authentication purposes). Given these internal indicia, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the letter into evidence as a statement of the defendant. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 901(a) (noting that authentication of evidence \"is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. <i>The Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Thompson contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because the government proved at most that he and Canney had a mere seller-buyer relationship, which is insufficient to establish a drug conspiracy, <i>see United States v. Gore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757557\"><a href=\"/opinion/757557/united-states-v-andre-gore-aka-sha-kwaun-counts-danny-johnson-arnold/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.1998), and did not establish the requisite conspiratorial \"agreement\" or \"meeting of minds.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal. <i>See United States v. Hatch,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202002\"><a href=\"/opinion/202002/united-states-v-hatch/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2006). Viewing the evidence and credibility determinations in the light most favorable to the verdict, we simply inquire whether a reasonable factfinder could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government was required to establish that Thompson agreed with Canney and others, albeit tacitly, to commit the substantive crime of cocaine distribution, that this was the object of their agreement, and that Thompson knowingly and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy. <i>See United States v. Santiago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196737\"><a href=\"/opinion/196737/united-states-v-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.1996). This is not a close question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government adduced ample evidence that Thompson and Canney were involved in much more than a mere one-time or transitory seller-buyer relationship. In distinguishing a conspiracy from a mere vendor-vendee arrangement, the core consideration is \"whether the evidence surrounding the transaction(s) is sufficient to allow a fairminded jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that A knew that B was reselling the drugs, and intended to facilitate the resales.\" <i>Id.</i> at 24. During their extended relationship, Thompson purchased for resale a total of 4 kilos of cocaine from Canney, and Thompson expressly told Canney that he was reselling it to his own clients, including Frank Cicero. Thompson cut the cocaine for Canney and for himself. On May 3, 2004, Thompson and Canney were on their way to deliver drugs to Cicero. Subsequent searches uncovered large quantities of drugs and cash, thus confirming that this joint drug distribution network was entrenched, and most definitely not a one-time, small-scale sales transaction. We accordingly conclude that the government adduced more than enough evidence that Thompson \"agreed\" to conspire with Canney and others in a cocaine distribution scheme. Consequently, we affirm the jury verdict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The unexplained delay in moving for mistrial suggests that defense counsel initially did not view the Wolf comment as so prejudicial that it warranted a new trial. Unless the defendant lodges a contemporaneous objection, rarely will we infer that a comment was unduly prejudicial<i>See Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 979.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Thompson forfeiture is hardly a surprise, given the trial evidence that Canney, Thompson, and Cicero were all drug sellers with a common source of supply (<i>viz.,</i> Higgins in New York), and that Canney and Thompson were on their way to deliver cocaine to Cicero on the day of their arrest.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Thompson also argues that the district court erred in allowing the government to adduce evidence that his Dodge Truck had a license plate which read \"DIRRTY,\" because that evidence was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial. As he did not object to this evidence in the district court, we review only for plain error<i>See United States v. Vazquez-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201585\"><a href=\"/opinion/201585/united-states-v-vazquez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 483 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The government offered the evidence to show that Thompson drove his girlfriend's vehicle when engaging in drug-related business, since her vehicle had a less conspicuous license plate, and Thompson wanted to avoid drawing attention.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
