This case concerns the standards for\n\nan award of attorneys' fees against an agency of the United States\n\nunder   the    Equal   Access     to   Justice    Act   (\"EAJA\"),   28    U.S.C.\n\n§ 2412(d)(1)(A).       The Act requires such an award for a successful\n\nlitigant    who   meets    the    particularized    standards    for     being   a\n\n\"prevailing party,\" when the government's position, either before\n\nor after suit was filed, was not substantially justified, and\n\nprovided that the award of fees would not otherwise be unjust.\n\nId.; see also generally Smith v. Fitchburg Pub. Sch., 401 F.3d 16\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n              Alexandre Aronov, an applicant for citizenship, sued the\n\nU.S.    Citizenship       and    Immigration     Service   (\"USCIS\"),      which\n\nimmediately entered into a voluntary settlement and never filed a\n\nresponsive pleading.        Instead the parties filed a joint motion to\n\nremand.     The district court issued a one-line order granting the\n\njoint motion to remand and terminating the case.                No hearing was\n\never held by the district court.         The order remanded to the USCIS,\n\nwhich swore in Aronov as a citizen on November 8, 2006, as it had\n\nrepresented in the joint motion that it would do.\n\n              Aronov, newly a citizen, then filed an application for\n\nfees and costs under the EAJA, which the district court granted in\n\nthe sum of $4,270.94, over the opposition of the USCIS.                The USCIS\n\nappealed.      The award was originally upheld by a panel, over a\n\ndissent.\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f            The USCIS sought en banc review, arguing that the panel\n\ndecision,      if    left    standing,        would   have    dangerous     systemic\n\nconsequences far beyond this case.               The precedent would \"create[]\n\nan enormous incentive for individuals frustrated with delays in the\n\nnaturalization process to file mandamus lawsuits in this Circuit;\n\n[and would] create[] an enormous disincentive for the agency to\n\nsettle these cases by agreeing to grant naturalization.\" It argued\n\nthe panel decision was contrary to law and \"undermine[d] the\n\nuniform judgment of both Congress and the agency that background\n\nchecks   are      critical    to    insuring     public      safety   and   national\n\nsecurity.\"        While the sum awarded in this case might be small, it\n\nsaid, the potential economic consequences were quite large.                    This\n\ncourt granted en banc review.1\n\n            We now reverse the award of fees and order dismissal of\n\nAronov's EAJA application with prejudice on the two separate and\n\nindependent grounds that he was not a prevailing party and that,\n\nwhether or not he met the prevailing party requirement, USCIS's\n\nposition     in     requiring      an   FBI    name   check    was    substantially\n\njustified.        The key question is not whether a court ultimately\n\nagrees with the agency's reading of its legal obligations but\n\nwhether the agency's position was substantially justified.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          We acknowledge with appreciation the assistance provided\nby the amicus American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\n                                          -4-\n\f                                I.\n\n          Aronov's suit, filed on August 28, 2006, was brought\n\nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b), which allows an applicant for citizenship\n\nto seek relief in federal district court if the USCIS does not act\n\non the application within 120 days of his or her citizenship\n\ninterview examination.   Section 1447(b) provides in full:\n\n                 If there is a failure to make a\n          determination under section 1446 of this title\n          before the end of the 120-day period after the\n          date on which the examination is conducted\n          under such section, the applicant may apply to\n          the United States district court for the\n          district in which the applicant resides for a\n          hearing on the matter. Such court has\n          jurisdiction over the matter and may either\n          determine the matter or remand the matter,\n          with appropriate instructions, to the [USCIS]\n          to determine the matter.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1447(b).\n\n          There are no disputed facts.   Aronov, a native of Russia\n\nand permanent U.S. resident since 2001, submitted an application\n\nfor citizenship to the USCIS on May 22, 2004.      On February 14,\n\n2005, a USCIS officer examined Aronov before the agency received a\n\nfull FBI background check for him, contrary to USCIS regulations.\n\nThe officer informed him that his application could not be approved\n\nuntil additional security checks were completed.\n\n          The USCIS erred by examining Aronov prematurely.      By\n\nregulation, the agency may not schedule an interview, which starts\n\nthe 120-day clock for filing suit under § 1447(b), until a full FBI\n\nbackground check for the applicant is complete.      See 8 C.F.R.\n\n                                -5-\n\f§ 335.2(b) (the USCIS will schedule interviews \"only after [it] has\n\nreceived a definitive response from the [FBI] that a full criminal\n\nbackground check of an applicant has been completed\").                   Mistakes\n\nhappen.   Nevertheless, the error was harmless2 and accrued to\n\nAronov’s benefit.      The early interview meant he was immediately\n\neligible for citizenship upon successful completion of the FBI\n\nbackground check and, under the literal terms of § 1447(b), was\n\nable to bring suit if the agency did not act on his application\n\nwithin 120 days.\n\n           On March 23, 2006, the USCIS sent Aronov written notice\n\nthat additional review of his case was necessary and asked Aronov\n\nto contact the agency if he did not receive a notice of action\n\nwithin six months.\n\n           Instead,    Aronov      sued.      The   USCIS   did    not    file    a\n\nresponsive   pleading.        On    October    6,   2006,   Aronov       and   the\n\ngovernment, having settled the case, filed a Joint Motion for\n\nRemand,   stating     that   \"USCIS    ha[d]    completed    its    review       of\n\nplaintiff's application for naturalization and, if jurisdiction\n\n[were] returned to the agency, [USCIS] would grant the application\n\nand schedule plaintiff's oath ceremony for no later than November\n\n8, 2006\" and requesting that the court \"remand the matter to USCIS\n\n\n\n     2\n          See generally Nat'l Ass'n of Home Builders v. Defenders\nof Wildlife, 127 S. Ct. 2518, 2530 (2007) (\"In administrative law\n. . . there is a harmless error rule.\" (quoting PDK Labs., Inc. v.\nU.S. Drug Enforcement Admin., 362 F.3d 786, 799 (D.C. Cir. 2004))).\n\n                                      -6-\n\fso   that    it   [could]     grant      plaintiff's   application      for\n\nnaturalization, and schedule plaintiff's oath ceremony for no later\n\nthan November 8, 2006.\"     Except on paper, the parties did not even\n\nappear   before   the   court,   there     were   no   hearings   and   no\n\nrepresentations were made about the parties' negotiations or the\n\nhistory of the matter.      On October 12, 2006, the court entered an\n\nelectronic order,3 which stated in full:\n\n            Electronic ORDER granting [Docket Number] 3\n            Joint Motion to Remand to US Citizenship and\n            Immigration Services.\n\nThat remand order forms the basis for the EAJA award at issue.           By\n\norder dated January 30, 2007, the district court awarded fees on\n\nthe basis that its order was a remand to the agency to do something\n\nand so met the judicial imprimatur requirement. The government, it\n\nfound, unjustifiably delayed the petition, forced Aronov to file\n\nhis action, and allowed for expedition only after mandamus was\n\nfiled.\n\n                                   II.\n\n            The EAJA provides in relevant part:\n\n            [A] court shall award to a prevailing party\n            other than the United States fees and other\n            expenses . . . incurred by that party in any\n            civil action (other than cases sounding in\n            tort), including proceedings for judicial\n            review of agency action, brought by or against\n\n\n     3\n          The parties agree the order was a final judgment; EAJA\napplications may not be filed until there is a final judgment. See\n28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(B), (d)(1)(D)(2)(G); see also Melkonyan v.\nSullivan, 501 U.S. 89, 97 (1991).\n\n                                   -7-\n\f           the United States in any court having\n           jurisdiction of that action, unless the court\n           finds that the position of the United States\n           was substantially justified or that special\n           circumstances make an award unjust.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A).\n\n           The   purpose    of   the   Act   is    \"to   ensure   that   certain\n\nindividuals . . . will not be deterred from seeking review of, or\n\ndefending against, unjustified governmental action because of the\n\nexpense involved.\"         Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U.S. 401, 407\n\n(2004) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 99-120(I), at 4 (1985), reprinted in\n\n1985 U.S.C.C.A.N. 132, 132-33). The EAJA \"reduces the disparity in\n\nresources between individuals . . . and the federal government.\"\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 99-120(I), at 4.\n\n           Two   issues    are   raised:     (1)   whether    Aronov     met   the\n\n\"judicial imprimatur\" requirement of the \"prevailing party\" test;\n\nand (2) whether the USCIS has met its burden of showing that it did\n\nnot act unreasonably.\n\n           We review a district court’s determinations under the\n\nEAJA for abuse of discretion.          Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552,\n\n558-59 (1988); Schock v. United States, 254 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   An error of law is an abuse of discretion.               Rosario-Urdaz\n\nv. Rivera-Hernandez, 350 F.3d 219, 221 (1st Cir. 2003); see also\n\nAtl. Fish Spotters Ass'n v. Daley, 205 F.3d 488, 491 n.2 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).   Whether a party is a prevailing party is itself a legal\n\ndetermination subject to de novo review.                 Rice Servs., Ltd. v.\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fUnited States, 405 F.3d 1017, 1021 (Fed. Cir. 2005); Smyth ex rel.\n\nSmyth v. Rivero, 282 F.3d 268, 274 (4th Cir. 2002).             The district\n\ncourt's award rests on errors of law.\n\n           The EAJA is a departure from the traditional \"American\n\nrule\" that parties must ordinarily bear their own attorneys' fees.\n\nSee Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421 U.S. 240,\n\n247 (1975).     Importantly, the EAJA is not simply a fee shifting\n\nstatute.   The EAJA is also a waiver by the government of its\n\nsovereign immunity and so must be construed strictly in favor of\n\nthe government.        Ardestani v. INS, 502 U.S. 129, 137 (1991).\n\nWhatever flexibility there may be in interpreting fee shifting\n\nstatutes involving awards against parties other than the United\n\nStates, such flexibility does not exist as to EAJA applications.\n\nSee Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U.S. 156, 161 (1981) (\"[L]imitations\n\nand conditions upon which the Government consents to be sued must\n\nbe strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied.\"\n\n(quoting Soriano v. United States, 352 U.S. 270, 276 (1957))).\n\nA.         The Judicial Imprimatur Standard Under the Prevailing\n           Party Requirement of the EAJA\n\n           We   hold   as   a   matter   of   law   that   Aronov   is   not   a\n\nprevailing party under the order entered by the district court.\n\n           The Supreme Court set the general standards for defining\n\nthe term \"prevailing party\" in federal attorneys' fees shifting\n\nstatutes in Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia\n\nDepartment of Health & Human Resources, 532 U.S. 598 (2001), a case\n\n                                     -9-\n\fconcerned with fee statutes other than the EAJA.4             Buckhannon sets\n\nthe minimum standards for prevailing party status under the EAJA.\n\n\"[T]he Supreme Court's reasoning in 'Buckhannon is presumed to\n\napply    generally   to   all   fee-shifting       statutes   that   use    the\n\nprevailing party terminology.'\" Smith, 401 F.3d at 22 n.8 (quoting\n\nDoe v. Boston Pub. Sch., 358 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 2004)) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); accord Ma v. Chertoff, 547 F.3d 342, 344\n\n(2d Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (collecting cases).\n\n            \"[T]he term 'prevailing party' [is] a legal term of art.\"\n\nBuckhannon, 532 U.S. at 603.        To be a prevailing party, a party\n\nmust show both a \"material alteration of the legal relationship of\n\nthe parties,\" id. at 604 (quoting Tex. State Teachers Ass'n v.\n\nGarland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 792-93 (1989)), and a\n\n\"judicial imprimatur on the change,\" id. at 605.\n\n            Both terms are illuminated by the potential meanings\n\nBuckhannon rejected: the Supreme Court held that mere success in\n\naccomplishing    a   party's    objectives    is    insufficient     to    be   a\n\nprevailing party for a fee award.         Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 606.\n\nThe Court rejected the \"catalyst\" theory which had been accepted by\n\nmany circuits, including this one.5          The Court noted that use of\n\n\n     4\n          Buckhannon involved provisions of the Federal Housing\nAmendments Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. § 3613(c)(2) and the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12205.\n     5\n          Buckhannon thus overruled this circuit's prior acceptance\nof the catalyst theory in Guglietti v. Secretary of Health & Human\nServices, 900 F.2d 397 (1st Cir. 1990) (applying EAJA), followed in\n\n                                   -10-\n\fthe catalyst theory would have the adverse effect of discouraging\n\nthe government from voluntarily settling cases (pre-suit or post-\n\nsuit). See id. at 608 (noting the \"disincentive that the 'catalyst\n\ntheory' may have upon a defendant's decision to voluntarily change\n\nits conduct\").      The Court stated that its plain language approach\n\nserved the purpose of providing a clear formula allowing for ready\n\nadministrability     and    avoiding    the   result   of    a    second      major\n\nlitigation over attorneys' fees.         See id. at 609-11.\n\n              Buckhannon   explicitly    identified    two       and   only    two\n\nsituations which meet the judicial imprimatur requirement: where\n\nplaintiff has \"received a judgment on the merits,\" which does not\n\napply here, or \"obtained a court-ordered consent decree.\"                  Id. at\n\n605.       The Court was clear that \"settlement agreements enforced\n\nthrough a consent decree\" may be the basis for fee awards and the\n\nresulting change in the legal relationship between the parties must\n\nbe \"court-ordered.\"        Id. at 604 (emphasis added).          The change in\n\nthe legal relationship must be a \"judicially sanctioned change.\"\n\nId. at 605.6     Notably, Buckhannon, which affirmed the judgment of\n\nthe Fourth Circuit in denying fees, did not adopt that portion of\n\n\n\nParis v. United States Department of Housing & Urban Development,\n988 F.2d 236 (1st Cir. 1993) (same).\n       6\n          The Court said these requirements were imposed by the\nplain language of the statute and while there was no need to resort\nto legislative history, that history was consistent with these\nrequirements. Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 607-08. We reject Aronov's\narguments that the legislative history supports a broader approach.\n\n                                    -11-\n\fthe Fourth Circuit rule which permitted an award of fees for a\n\n\"settlement giving some of the legal relief sought\" in addition to\n\nfees for an \"enforceable judgment [or] consent decree.\"                     Id. at\n\n602.\n\n             The order here was plainly not a judgment on the merits,\n\nnor    was   it    labeled    a   \"court-ordered     consent     decree.\"    That,\n\nhowever, does not end the matter.                We agree with other circuits\n\nthat the formal label of \"consent decree\" need not be attached;7 it\n\nis the reality, not the nomenclature which is at issue.                 Sometimes\n\nthe question has been phrased in terms of whether a given court\n\norder is the \"functional equivalent of a consent decree\"; the\n\nbetter articulation may be to ask whether the order contains the\n\nsort of judicial involvement and actions inherent in a \"court-\n\nordered consent decree.\"               The district court did not allow EAJA\n\nfees on the basis that the order it entered was the equivalent of\n\na consent decree.            Rather, it said in its award order that it\n\nentered the award on the ground that it had entered an order\n\ncompelling        the   agency    to    take   action,   which   it   thought   was\n\n\n       7\n          See, e.g., Davy v. CIA, 456 F.3d 162, 166 (D.C. Cir.\n2006) (holding, under the attorneys' fee provision of the Freedom\nof Information Act, that an award was appropriate even though the\ncourt's order was \"styled 'order' as opposed to 'consent decree'\");\nsee also Rice Servs., 405 F.3d at 1026-27 (EAJA); T.D. v.

Indeed, Aronov never argued to the\n\ndistrict court that this situation was so like a consent decree as\n\nto constitute the requisite judicial imprimatur.         Nonetheless, the\n\nconsent decree theory is the primary grounds now asserted, and the\n\nparties have addressed the issue to the en banc court.           We bypass\n\nhis waiver and address the argument.8\n\n             The Supreme Court has described what it meant by a\n\n\"court-ordered consent decree.\"            It distinguished such consent\n\ndecrees from \"private settlements\" (as to which fees may not be\n\nawarded), saying \"[p]rivate settlements do not entail the judicial\n\napproval and oversight involved in consent decrees.\"            Id. at 604\n\nn.7.       Buckhannon contrasted final judgments on the merits and\n\ncourt-ordered consent decrees with situations which failed to meet\n\nthe judicial imprimatur test: for example, securing the reversal of\n\na directed verdict, acquiring a judicial pronouncement that a\n\ndefendant has violated the Constitution unaccompanied by \"judicial\n\nrelief,\"     or   obtaining   a   non-judicial    \"alteration   of   actual\n\ncircumstances.\"     Id. at 605-06.\n\n             The Court emphasized three related factors.         The first\n\nwas that the change in legal relationship must be \"court-ordered.\"\n\nSee id. at 604.      Second, there must be judicial approval of the\n\nrelief vis-à-vis the merits of the case. Buckhannon cited Kokkonen\n\n\n       8\n          There is no basis, as a result, to consider deference to\nnon-existing \"findings\" of the district court, as to whether this\nwas the equivalent of a consent decree.\n\n                                    -13-\n\fv. Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America, 511 U.S. 375, 381\n\n(1994), which held a \"judge's mere awareness and approval of the\n\nterms of the settlement agreement do not suffice to make them part\n\nof his order.\" Third, there must be judicial oversight and ability\n\nto enforce the obligations imposed on the parties. See Buckhannon,\n\n532 U.S. at 604 n.7 (noting that judicial oversight is inherent in\n\nconsent decrees but not in private settlements).\n\n           These   factors   from    Buckhannon   are   themselves,   not\n\nsurprisingly, contained in the law of consent decrees.        A consent\n\ndecree \"embodies an agreement of the parties,\" that they \"desire\n\nand expect will be reflected in, and be enforceable as, a judicial\n\ndecree.\"   Frew ex rel. Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 437 (2004)\n\n(quoting Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 378\n\n(1992)); see also Ricci v. Patrick, 544 F.3d 8, 17 (1st Cir. 2008),\n\ncert. denied, ___ S.Ct. ___, 2009 WL 229763 (Apr. 6, 2009).       As the\n\nFourth Circuit noted in Smyth:\n\n           A consent decree, because it is entered as an\n           order of the court, receives court approval\n           and is subject to the oversight attendant to\n           the court's authority to enforce its orders,\n           characteristics not typical of settlement\n           agreements. [Buckhannon]'s admonition that\n           consent decrees may satisfy the prevailing\n           party standard while private settlements ought\n           not be so construed is thus consistent with\n           the general purposes and effects of the two\n           forms of resolution of disputes.\n\nSmyth, 282 F.3d at 281.      Court approval of a consent decree must\n\ninvolve some appraisal of the merits.             See id. at 279.     By\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fcontrast, a private settlement does not, ordinarily, receive court\n\napproval.       Id. at 280.     A court entering a consent decree must\n\nexamine its terms to be sure they are fair and not unlawful.                  See\n\nid.; see also T.D., 349 F.3d at 479 (\"Mere involvement [by the\n\ncourt] in a settlement . . . is not enough.               There must be some\n\nofficial judicial approval of the settlement.\").                As an example,\n\nthe Third Circuit held in John T. ex rel. Paul T. v. Delaware\n\nCounty Intermediate Unit, 318 F.3d 545, 558-60 (3d Cir. 2003), that\n\nneither a preliminary injunction nor a contempt order based on that\n\ninjunction contained the necessary judicial imprimatur because\n\nneither      had   required   the   court    to   weigh   the   merits   of   the\n\nunderlying dispute.9\n\n              Further, an obligation to comply and the provision of\n\njudicial oversight to enforce that obligation are the sine qua non\n\nfor a consent decree.         See Smyth, 282 F.3d at 279-81; see also\n\nRoberson, 346 F.3d at 82-83; Am. Disability Ass'n, 289 F.3d at\n\n1320.       While a consent decree begins as a settlement, it is one\n\nthat \"includes an injunction, or some other form of specific\n\nrelief,\" which may ultimately be enforceable by contempt.                     C.A.\n\nWright & M.K. Kane, Law of Federal Courts § 98, at 702 n.2 (6th ed.\n\n2002).       This means enforcement through an action for breach of\n\n\n\n        9\n          A consent decree, which has attributes both of contracts\nand of judicial decrees, Local No. 93, Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters\nv. City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 519 (1986), must, therefore, go\nbeyond contractual obligations.\n\n                                      -15-\n\fcontract, which may be available in a private settlement, is\n\ninsufficient to meet the standards for a consent decree.                   See\n\nChristina A. ex rel. Jennifer A. v. Bloomberg, 315 F.3d 990, 993\n\n(8th Cir. 2003).\n\n            \"The parties to a consent decree expect and achieve a\n\ncontinuing basis of jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the\n\nresolution of their case in the court entering the order.\"            Smyth,\n\n282 F.3d at 280. A private settlement agreement, by contrast, does\n\nnot require the same level of judicial oversight.\n\n            Another   characteristic     of    the     judicially   approved\n\nobligations in a consent decree is that a party seeking to modify\n\na consent decree must meet a significant burden to demonstrate that\n\ncircumstances    have   changed   to     a    degree    that   justifies     a\n\nmodification.    See generally Rufo, 502 U.S. at 378-83; see also\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).       This is so because, by its nature, a\n\nconsent decree contemplates a court's continuing involvement in a\n\nmatter.10\n\n            Application of these principles necessarily results in\n\nthe conclusion the order entered here did not meet the judicial\n\nimprimatur standards for a prevailing party.              Whether an order\n\n\n\n     10\n          In Pierce, a pre-Buckhannon case where the Supreme Court\naffirmed an award of EAJA fees, the district court administered and\nenforced the settlement agreement reached. See Pierce, 487 U.S. at\n556 (noting that the government had created a $60 million\nsettlement fund and that a California federal court had taken\nresponsibility for administering the settlement).\n\n                                  -16-\n\fcontains a sufficient judicial imprimatur can only be determined by\n\ndetermining the content of the order against the entire context\n\nbefore the court.    The order here lacked all of the core indicia of\n\na consent decree.     The court did not order USCIS to do anything.11\n\nThe   court   made   no   evaluation   at   all   of   the   merits   of   the\n\ncontroversy -- indeed the court was never asked to do so; it was\n\nonly asked to dismiss the case.        There was no basis on which the\n\ncourt could evaluate the merits because the USCIS never filed an\n\nanswer, never raised the potential defenses it had, and there never\n\nwas an engagement of any sort on the merits for the district court\n\nto consider.12 Further, the order itself did not contain provisions\n\n\n      11\n          We need not address what the proper vehicle would have\nbeen had the USCIS failed to carry through with its representation\nthat it would grant citizenship. But it is clear that the district\ncourt erred in concluding it could directly hold the USCIS in\ncontempt in such circumstances because the order did not issue a\nmandate to the USCIS. Before a court can find a party in contempt\nfor violating an order, it must conclude that \"the words of the\ncourt's order have clearly and unambiguously forbidden the precise\nconduct on which the contempt allegation is based.\" United States\nv. Saccoccia, 433 F.3d 19, 28 (1st Cir. 2005) (emphasis in\noriginal); see also id. (\"[T]he test is whether the putative\ncontemnor is 'able to ascertain from the four corners of the order\nprecisely what acts are forbidden.'\" (emphasis added) (quoting Goya\nFoods, Inc. v. Wallack Mgmt. Co., 290 F.3d 63, 76 (1st Cir.\n2002))). A consent decree may itself contain mandatory language\nthat is directly enforceable by a contempt action.\n      12\n          This case is factually distinguishable from the Tenth\nCircuit's recent decision in Al-Maleki v. Holder, No. 07-4260, 2009\nWL 692612 (10th Cir. Mar. 18, 2009). There, the court upheld an\naward of fees under the EAJA where the district court, after the\ncase was filed, denied the government's initial motion for an\nunrestricted remand after a hearing, ordered the government to file\nan answer, accepted the representations in the answer, then granted\na joint motion to remand, and entered an order expressly directing\n\n                                   -17-\n\ffor future enforcement typical of consent decrees.           See Kokkonen,\n\n511 U.S. at 381; Saccoccia, 433 F.3d at 28.          The order also did not\n\nresolve   a    dispute   between   the    parties,    it   merely   returned\n\njurisdiction to the agency to allow the parties to carry out their\n\nagreement.13    Indeed, the order would not create prevailing party\n\n\nthe USCIS to administer the oath of citizenship to the applicant,\nAbbas Al-Maleki. The court found an order directing the agency to\nact was required because, as the court noted, \"at the time the\ndistrict court's order was entered, USCIS had not yet naturalized\nAl-Maleki or made a binding commitment to do so.\"      Id. at *3.\nHere, there were no such proceedings. No such order was entered;\nthe court only remanded to the agency for it to act on its promise\nto grant citizenship. Our pointing out these factual distinctions\nshould not be taken as agreement with the panel decision of the\nTenth Circuit on this or any other point.\n     13\n          The dissenters appear to characterize the district court\nas either having essentially issued an injunction requiring the\nagency to perform certain actions or as somehow having turned the\nremand into a consent decree. The dissenters' reading is not based\non the actual October 12, 2006 remand order, but on the district\ncourt's later characterization of the order.       The argument is\nflawed for a number of reasons. First, the district court itself\ndid not at any time characterize itself as having issued an\ninjunction or as having approved a consent decree which\nincorporated other terms into its order, and properly so.       The\nrequirements of Rule 65 were never met nor sought to be met nor was\nthis presented as a consent decree.\n          Second, the October 12, 2006 order on its face is merely\nan allowance of a motion to remand, it was not an injunction nor\ndid it incorporate anything else.     On its face, the order was\nunambiguous and lacked any provision mandating the USCIS to act or\nexpressly retaining jurisdiction to force the government to act.\nWhile the allowance of motions for remand after litigation may meet\nthe EAJA criteria for judicial imprimatur, this did not.\n          Third, while a district court's later characterization of\nwhat it had intended in an earlier order may at times be helpful,\nthis situation does not fall into any of the usual patterns. For\nexample, the district court was not involved in settlement\nnegotiations which enabled it to shed light on the nature of the\nsettlement. See F.A.C., Inc. v. Cooperativa de Seguros de Vida de\nP.R., 449 F.3d 185, 192 (1st Cir. 2006). Nor was this an issue of\n\n                                   -18-\n\fstatus under the tests adopted by any of the circuits.   See, e.g.,\n\nDavy, 456 F.3d at 165-66; Rice Servs., 405 F.3d at 1027; T.D., 349\n\nF.3d at 478; Roberson, 346 F.3d at 81; Truesdell, 290 F.3d at 165;\n\nAm. Disability Ass'n, 289 F.3d at 1320-21; Smyth, 282 F.3d at 276.\n\n          Aronov's argument is also inconsistent with Smith, which\n\nheld that the fact that the defendant has voluntarily agreed to\n\nchange its behavior does not lead to prevailing party status for\n\nthe plaintiff.   A plaintiff does not become a prevailing party if\n\nthe court merely recognizes what the government has voluntarily\n\n\n\nwhether statements from the bench were meant to be a judicial\norder. See New Eng. Reg'l Council of Carpenters v. Kinton, 284\nF.3d 9, 30 (1st Cir. 2002). Nor was there any ambiguity in its\nOctober 12 order. See Harvey v. Johanns, 494 F.3d 237, 242 (1st\nCir. 2007).\n          Fourth, it is also firmly the law that there must be a\nclear basis within the order (of October 12) for both the court's\ncontinuing jurisdiction and its power to enforce an agreement\nbetween the parties. Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 381; Saccoccia, 433\nF.3d at 28. In F.A.C., we held that a court's order must expressly\nretain jurisdiction or expressly incorporate the terms of a\nsettlement agreement to satisfy Kokkonen. A \"bare reference to 'a\nsettlement agreement' does not satisfy Kokkonen.\" F.A.C., 449 F.3d\nat 190. That was not done here. See also Smith, 401 F.3d at 24\n(\"For an order to be considered the functional equivalent of a\nconsent decree, . . . '[t]he obligation to comply with a\nsettlement's terms must be expressly made part of a court's order\nfor jurisdiction to enforce the settlement after dismissal of the\naction to exist.'\" (quoting Smyth, 282 F.3d at 283 (emphasis\nadded))); Hospitality House, Inc. v. Gilbert, 298 F.3d 424, 431-32\n(5th Cir. 2002) (holding a district court order that included a\nsettlement order attached as an exhibit did not satisfy Kokkonen\nbecause \"to make a settlement agreement part of a dismissal order\nby incorporation, Kokkonen requires a district court to clearly\nindicate its intention within the dismissal order itself by\nexpressly incorporating the agreement's terms\" and noting that \"a\nnumber of our sister circuits have similarly interpreted\nKokkonen\").\n\n                               -19-\n\fagreed to and only \"requir[es] [the government] to follow through\n\nwith what [it] had already voluntarily promised to do.\" Smith, 401\n\nF.3d at 27.\n\n          Aronov makes a separate argument that a remand to the\n\nagency was necessary so that citizenship could be granted, and that\n\nthis suffices to make him a prevailing party.    We need not resolve\n\nthe question of whether the agency could have acted without the\n\nremand,14 as it does not matter to our resolution of the judicial\n\nimprimatur issue.   The order remanding to the agency is alone not\n\nenough to establish the needed imprimatur. See, e.g., Rice Servs.,\n\n405 F.3d at 1025 (under the EAJA, securing a remand order alone is\n\ninsufficient; the claimant must secure relief on the merits); see\n\nalso Envtl. Def. Fund, Inc. v. Reilly, 1 F.3d 1254, 1257-58 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1993) (same, applying Resource Conservation and Recovery Act).\n\nAronov's argument is simply an effort to revive the \"catalyst\n\ntheory,\" which the Supreme Court has rejected.\n\nB.        Substantial Justification\n\n          Even if the court order in this case had the attributes\n\nof a consent decree, the remaining condition for an EAJA award has\n\nnot been met.   We also hold as a matter of law that the government\n\n\n     14\n          Compare Etape v. Chertoff, 497 F.3d 379, 383-87 (4th Cir.\n2007) (holding that a district court has exclusive jurisdiction\nonce a § 1447(b) suit is filed), and United States v. Hovsepian,\n359 F.3d 1144, 1159 (9th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (same), with Xie v.\nMukasey, 575 F. Supp. 2d 963, 964-65 (E.D. Wis. 2008) (holding that\nthe court and USCIS have concurrent jurisdiction), and Bustamante\nv. Chertoff, 533 F. Supp. 2d 373, 376 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (same).\n\n                                -20-\n\fhas met its burden to show its pre-litigation actions or inactions15\n\nwhich led to this suit were substantially justified.\n\n             An action is \"substantially justified\" if \"it has a\n\nreasonable basis in law and fact.\" Pierce, 487 U.S. at 566 n.2.\n\nThe government's conduct must be \"justified to a degree that could\n\nsatisfy a reasonable person.\"        Id. at 565; see also Schock, 254\n\nF.3d at 5.    The government need only have \"a reasonable basis both\n\nin law and in fact for its position.\"          De Allende v. Baker, 891\n\nF.2d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 1989); see also United States v. Yoffe, 775\n\nF.2d 447, 449 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\n             Importantly,   for   EAJA    purposes,   the   position   of   a\n\ngovernment agency can be substantially justified even if a court\n\nultimately determines the agency's reading of the law was not\n\ncorrect.      Pierce, 487 U.S. at 566 n.2 (\"[A] position can be\n\njustified even though it is not correct, and we believe it can be\n\nsubstantially . . . justified if a reasonable person could think it\n\ncorrect.\").    The government's position as to what the law requires\n\nmay be substantially justified even if its interpretation of its\n\nlegal obligations is not ultimately affirmed by a court.           Schock,\n\n254 F.3d at 5.      In De Allende, we held that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees under the EAJA\n\nwhen the government was \"at least reasonable\" in denying a visa,\n\n\n\n     15\n          The parties agree that the government's post-litigation\nconduct was substantially justified.\n\n                                   -21-\n\feven though the applicant's interpretation of the underlying law\n\nultimately prevailed.     De Allende, 891 F.2d at 12, 13; see also Li\n\nv. Keisler, 505 F.3d 913, 920 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding, under the\n\nEAJA, that \"[i]n the absence of guidance from this court, the\n\ngovernment's position was substantially justified\"); Trahan v.\n\nBrady, 907 F.2d 1215, 1219-20 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (finding substantial\n\njustification    where   government   acted     in   response   to    what   it\n\nreasonably,     though   incorrectly,    believed     was   its      statutory\n\nobligation).\n\n           And of course, if the agency reasonably believes the\n\naction or inaction is required by law, then, by definition it\n\ncannot be the basis for an award of EAJA fees.           See Dantran, Inc.\n\nv. U.S. Dep't of Labor, 246 F.3d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 2001) (the\n\ngovernment's    pre-litigation   conduct   of    initiating     a    debarment\n\nprocedure was substantially justified because it was required to do\n\nso by statute).\n\n           Aronov's argument rests on a fundamental misapprehension\n\nof what substantially justified means.        His argument is addressed\n\nto why he thinks the agency is not legally \"right\" in its position\n\nand not to whether the USCIS position was substantially justified,\n\na different question.      The test is whether a reasonable person\n\ncould think the agency position is correct.            Pierce, 487 U.S. at\n\n566 n.2.   While we think the agency was \"right\" in how it handled\n\nthe matter, the substantial justification analysis does not hinge\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\fon whether the agency was right or wrong but on whether its actions\n\nwere reasonable.\n\n          Aronov concedes no case flatly held the law required the\n\nagency to adopt his position.    Nonetheless, he argues the position\n\nwas unreasonable because no statute mandates USCIS to use the\n\nbacklogged FBI name check,16 and that § 1447(b) establishes a\n\n\"statutory deadline\" of 120 days after the interview to grant or\n\ndeny citizenship, and so violation of the deadline means the\n\ngovernment's position was not substantially justified.\n\n          The   decision   by   the   agency   not   to   grant   Aronov\n\ncitizenship until his background check was completed, even if that\n\nexceeded 120 days, stemmed from two statutory mandates under which\n\nthe agency must operate.   First, 8 U.S.C. § 1446(a) provides that\n\n\"[b]efore a person may be naturalized, an employee of [the USCIS]\n\n. . . shall conduct a personal investigation of the person applying\n\n\n\n     16\n           In May 2008, USCIS had approximately 270,000 name check\ncases pending for all categories of applicants, and over 80% of the\ncases had been pending for more than 90 days. In April 2008, USCIS\nand the FBI announced a joint plan to eliminate the backlog in name\ncheck searches by refining the search process and increasing the\namount of staff dedicated to conducting searches. See Citizenship\nand Immigration Services Ombudsman, Annual Report 2008, at 6-7,\navailable at http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/CISOMB_Annual_\nReport_2008.pdf.    The number of pending name checks dropped to\napproximately 95,000 by August 2008. See Press Release, Update on\nPending FBI Name Checks and Projected Naturalization Processing\nTimes, http://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr_1220993097713.shtm. An\namicus brief filed by the American Immigration Lawyers Association\nreported a study of cases filed in district courts in the First\nCircuit.     It concluded that plaintiffs had filed 137 cases\ninvolving naturalization delay litigation in 2007.\n\n                                 -23-\n\ffor naturalization.\"    Second, in a budgetary statute that has\n\ncontinuing effect, Congress provided that \"none of the funds\n\nappropriated or otherwise made available to the [USCIS] shall be\n\nused to complete adjudication of an application for naturalization\n\nunless the [USCIS] has received confirmation from the [FBI] that a\n\nfull criminal background check has been completed.\" Departments of\n\nCommerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies\n\nAppropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 105-119, 111 Stat. 2440, 2448-49\n\n(1997) [hereinafter 1997 Appropriations Act].   These are statutory\n\ncommands the agency could not ignore.\n\n          Aronov's argument is that the phrase \"confirmation from\n\nthe [FBI] that a full criminal background check has been completed\"\n\ndid not require the USCIS or the FBI to include an FBI name check\n\nin that process.   While it might have been reasonable, he argues,\n\nto require the FBI name check if it could have been completed\n\nwithin 120 days, it was not reasonable to do so if that name check\n\nrequirement virtually guaranteed that the application process would\n\ntake longer than 120 days to complete.\n\n          It is true that Congress did not define for the agency\n\nwhat a full criminal background check was.   Congress chose to let\n\nthe USCIS, with its particular expertise, decide the content of\n\nthat \"confirmation from the [FBI] [of] a full criminal background\n\ncheck.\"   1997 Appropriations Act, 111 Stat. at 2448-49.      That\n\ndelegation to USCIS is entirely sensible for a number of reasons,\n\n\n                               -24-\n\fincluding         the     sometimes    rapidly       evolving      law    enforcement\n\ntechnologies.           The USCIS decided in 2002 that the inclusion of FBI\n\nname        checks       provided     better     full        criminal      background\n\ninvestigations.           It reached this conclusion after the terrorist\n\nattacks      of    September    11,   2001     and   after    it   discovered    that\n\ndeficiencies in its previous screening process had resulted in the\n\ngrant of naturalization to a man suspected of ties to the terrorist\n\ngroup Hezbollah.            See S.S. Hsu & N.C. Aizenman, FBI Name Check\n\nCited in Naturalization Delays, Wash. Post, June 17, 2007, at A1.\n\nAlso, Congress used the word \"full\" criminal background check,\n\nwhich supports the choice of the commonly used FBI name checks.17\n\n              Further, Congress has since essentially endorsed the\n\nUSCIS's choice to use FBI name checks as part of the required\n\ncriminal background check when, in 2007 (after the delay in this\n\ncase), it addressed the delays by appropriating $20 million to\n\nUSCIS to \"address backlogs of security checks associated with\n\npending      applications      and    petitions\"     provided      that   the   agency\n\nsubmitted a plan to eliminate the backlogs and ensure that the\n\n\n       17\n          The FBI provides name check information to dozens of\nfederal,   state,   and  foreign   agencies   \"seeking  background\ninformation from FBI files on individuals before bestowing a\nprivilege -- [w]hether that privilege is government employment or\nan appointment; a security clearance; attendance at a White House\nfunction; a Green card or naturalization; admission to the bar; or\na visa for the privilege of visiting our homeland.\" Foreign Travel\nto the United States:     Testimony Before the H.

Div., FBI), available at\n2003 WL 21608243.\n\n                                         -25-\n\fagency \"has the information it needs to carry out its mission.\"18\n\nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-161, div.\n\nE, tit. IV, 121 Stat. 1844, 2067 (Dec. 26, 2007).\n\n               Congress chose not to prohibit the use of the FBI name\n\ncheck, but rather provided funding to expedite the process USCIS\n\nhad chosen.        The agency's, and the FBI's, choices to use name\n\nchecks     were    clearly    within   their    legal      authority    and   were\n\nreasonable.       Principles of administrative law require that courts\n\ndefer     to   reasonable    interpretations     by   an    agency     on   matters\n\ncommitted to the agency's expertise by Congress.               Chevron U.S.A.,\n\nInc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43\n\n(1984); Global NAPs, Inc. v. Verizon New Eng., Inc., 505 F.3d 43,\n\n47 (1st Cir. 2007).         Agencies are also entitled to deference with\n\nrespect to policy determinations.              Citizens to Preserve Overton\n\nPark, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971), overruled on other\n\n\n     18\n           Congress's appropriation also addresses amicus's policy\nargument that the fact that cases brought under § 1447(b), like\nAronov's, have spurred the agency to speed up the name check\nprocess should lead us to award fees.    While § 1447(b) claimants\nand their counsel may play a commendable role in bringing attention\nto the backlog problem, amicus's argument is relevant only to the\ncatalyst theory. Further, the government had been aware of the\nbacklog in security checks before the peak in litigation that\namicus cites, see, e.g., Citizenship and Immigration Services\nOmbudsman,    Annual   Report   2004,   at    4-5,   available   at\nhttp://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/CISReport_to_Congress.pdf, and\nit responded by securing additional resources to address the\nproblem, see, e.g., Oversight of the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation: Hearing before the S. Judiciary Comm. (Sept. 17,\n2008) (statement of Robert S. Mueller, III, Dir., FBI) (\"[W]hen we\nhad the backlog, [and] recognized it, we sought the funding, [and]\nreceived the funding to address the backlog.\").\n\n                                       -26-\n\fgrounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977); Global NAPs,\n\n505 F.3d at 47; Associated Fisheries of Me., Inc. v. Daley, 127\n\nF.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 1997). Once the USCIS made that choice, it\n\nacted under the requirements of law -- its own regulations -- in\n\nawaiting the full background check.        Aronov argues the agency was\n\nnot permitted to make that choice because it was mandated by\n\nstatute, § 1447(b), to complete all checks within 120 days.\n\n           In its briefing to this court, USCIS has taken the\n\nposition that the statute does not impose a flat 120-day deadline\n\nto grant citizenship.      The agency argues that the plain text of the\n\nstatute says only that if the agency fails to make a determination\n\nof citizenship within the 120-day period after the interview, \"the\n\napplicant may apply to the United States district court\" for it to\n\n\"determine the matter or remand the matter, with appropriate\n\ninstructions, to the Service to determine the matter.\"           8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1447(b).      The agency also supports its reading with a reference\n\nto the Congressional history.      See 135 Cong. Rec. H4539, H4542-43,\n\n1989 WL 182156 (daily ed. July 31, 1989) (legislative history of\n\n§   1447(b)'s    120-day   provision)   (discussing   the   importance   of\n\naddressing delays but making no mention of a deadline on the\n\nagency).\n\n           If the statute is read literally, as the USCIS argues,\n\nthe agency could reasonably believe it does not violate the statute\n\nby not acting within 120 days on the grounds that the statute does\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\fnot command it to act within the deadline.              Cf. United States v.\n\nJames Daniel Good Real Prop., 510 U.S. 43, 63 (1993) (holding that\n\ndismissal of government's forfeiture action for failure to follow\n\nstatutory timing guidelines was unwarranted because \"if a statute\n\ndoes not specify a consequence for noncompliance with statutory\n\ntiming provisions, the federal courts will not in the ordinary\n\ncourse impose their own coercive sanction\").\n\n             Aronov replies that even if the statute does not set a\n\ndeadline of 120 days, the agency by regulation has.              See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 335.3(a) (\"A decision to grant or deny the application shall be\n\nmade at the time of the initial examination or within 120 days\n\nafter the date of the initial examination of the applicant . . .\n\n.\").   That regulation should, of course, be read in the context of\n\nthe regulations defining when an initial determination may take\n\nplace.       Aronov   was    mistakenly    given    a    premature     initial\n\nexamination.     See id. § 335.2(b).\n\n             Even were the agency's views wrong as to the requirement\n\nfor FBI name checks and as to whether the statute and/or regulation\n\nimposed a flat 120-day deadline, its views were still substantially\n\njustified.    Neither the Supreme Court nor this court has ever held\n\nthat   FBI   name   checks   are   not   required   as    part   of   full   FBI\n\nbackground checks or that § 1447 imposes an absolute time limit for\n\ngranting citizenship regardless of whether the name check is\n\ncompleted.     At most, then, this is a situation in which an agency\n\n\n                                    -28-\n\fhas imposed regulatory requirements on itself that are in tension,\n\nand the solution it chose, to bend the 120-day rule because the\n\nbackground check was not completed, is entirely reasonable.\n\n           Independently, the choice by USCIS to favor national\n\nsecurity   in   requiring   a    full   check   of    the    background   of   a\n\ncitizenship     applicant   over    a   self-imposed        120-day   deadline,\n\nregardless of whether the interview was prematurely granted here,\n\ncannot be unreasonable.        As the USCIS has stated:\n\n           Although [FBI name checks] may require a more\n           lengthy processing time, USCIS believes that\n           performing them is essential to identifying\n           national security and public safety concerns\n           that would not have been uncovered by other\n           means. This is particularly true given that\n           in[] a few cases, the information obtained\n           from the FBI through this process has\n           reflected very significant issues and risks.\n           FBI name checks disclose information to USCIS\n           that is otherwise not available. . . . USCIS\n           is committed to effective background checks,\n           and thus is committed to the FBI name check.\n\nUSCIS,   Response   to   the    Citizenship     and   Immigration     Services\n\nOmbudsman's 2006 Report, at 10, available at http://www.dhs.gov/\n\nxlibrary/assets/USCIS-Response-Ombudsman-06-Report-May-2007.pdf.\n\nIt is not unreasonable for the agency to require greater certainty\n\nwhen deciding whether to grant citizenship.           See Alexander v. INS,\n\n74 F.3d 367, 370 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"[T]he right in question --\n\nAmerican citizenship -- is one of the most precious imaginable.\").\n\n           Indeed, the importance of the greater certainty that the\n\nname check provides is highlighted by the agency's choice in 2007\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fto address the backlog problem by distinguishing between applicants\n\nfor residency and applicants for citizenship -- USCIS grants\n\nresidency to applicants if their cases were otherwise complete but\n\ntheir name checks remained pending over 180 days from the date of\n\nthe initial request.            See USCIS Interoffice Memorandum, Revised\n\nNational Security Adjudication and Reporting Requirements (Feb. 4,\n\n2008), available at http://www.uscis.gov/files/pressrelease/DOC017.\n\nPDF.        The agency reasonably concluded that, if the name checks\n\nturned up negative information about applicants, it could initiate\n\nremoval proceedings against those granted residency while it would\n\nhave    much        more    difficulty   proceeding     against     those   granted\n\ncitizenship.         See S.S. Hsu, U.S. to Skirt Green-Card Check, Wash.\n\nPost, Feb. 12, 2008, at A3 (citing statement by USCIS spokesperson\n\nChristopher S. Bentley).\n\n               Aronov advances one more reason why, in his view, the\n\nagency had been unreasonable. He argues that the USCIS had created\n\na system for giving priority to certain applicants, under which the\n\nagency would request the application be expedited if, for example,\n\nthe applicant were facing military deployment. One of the official\n\nfactors is whether the applicant has filed an action for mandamus.19\n\nAronov       says    that   this   has   created   an   incentive    system   which\n\n\n       19\n          The criteria for expediting are: \"Military deployment\nmust be imminent,\" \"Age-out benefits,\" \"Writ of Mandamus,\"\n\"Immigration Judge cases -- grant of lawful permanent residence,\"\nand \"Compelling reasons as provided by the requesting office (i.e.,\ncritical medical condition) assessed on a case by case basis.\"\n\n                                          -30-\n\frequires candidates to sue to get priority in having FBI name\n\nchecks done, which unreasonably forces applicants to sue.          As the\n\nUSCIS points out, the logic of this argument is to impose EAJA fees\n\non it in the numerous instances it has benefitted an applicant by\n\ngiving priority to the applicant's name check.\n\n          The   reasoning   assumes    there   is   some   right   in   the\n\napplicant to priority, but there is no statutory right, given to\n\nAronov or anyone else, to jump the queue.      And the agency's choice\n\nto give priorities to the categories it selected was a rational\n\nallocation of resources,20 which must be spent on litigation if the\n\nagency does not work out a voluntary solution.21            For the same\n\n\n     20\n          Aronov and amicus argue that in an EAJA action, a court\ncan never consider the resources of the agency on the question of\nwhether the agency's actions were substantially justified. That is\nnot so. Aronov and amicus wrongly rely on the Court's statement in\nCommissioner, INS v. Jean, 496 U.S. 154 (1990), that under the\nEAJA, \"[t]he Government's general interest in protecting the\nfederal fisc is subordinate to the specific statutory goals of\nencouraging private parties to vindicate their rights.\" Id. at\n164-65 (footnote omitted).     This statement addresses only the\nargument, which the government does not make here, that the\nagency's need for resources should outweigh a successful\napplicant's right to an award.     It is simply irrelevant to the\nseparate issue of whether the government's prelitigation position\nwas substantially justified. A court can, and should, take into\naccount the resources that an agency has to meet its statutory\ncommands and to proceed in fairness to all applicants in light of\nthe constraints under which it operates. The EAJA was meant to\nallow plaintiffs to challenge \"unjustified governmental action\";\nthe state of an agency's resources is material to whether its\nchoice was or was not justified. Here, the agency was justified in\nacting as it did in light of its resources.\n     21\n          In Al-Maleki, the Tenth Circuit found the government's\nprelitigation conduct not substantially justified.    There, the\nissue was defined as whether the USCIS had unreasonably rejected\n\n                                -31-\n\freasons, Aronov's argument that he should be given fees against the\n\nFBI if not the USCIS fails.\n\n                               III.\n\n          The order awarding attorneys' fees is reversed and the\n\napplication for fees is ordered dismissed with prejudice.\n\n\n\n                   -Dissenting Opinions Follow-\n\n\n\n\npetitioner's informal efforts to resolve the matter and failed,\nafter the 120-day period, to request an expedited FBI name check.\nThe only justification presented by the government, unlike this\ncase, was that it was unable, at that point, to request expedition.\nThe circuit court found this was factually untrue. It also held\n\"[b]ecause USCIS ha[d] not offered any other justification for its\nprelitigation actions,\" Al-Maleki, 2009 WL 692612, at *7, there was\nno abuse of discretion. Thus, that court was not faced with the\njustifications offered to us.\n\n                               -32-\n\f          TORRUELLA,   Circuit   Judge   (Dissenting).   This   appeal\n\npresents a recurring example of what appears to be this Court's\n\nvarying standards when judging governmental power as compared to\n\nthose that apply to citizen challenges to government authority.\n\n          I join Judge Lipez's dissent, which carefully explains\n\nhow the government failed to comply with its own regulations and\n\ndeadlines, thereby unreasonably forcing Aronov to sue to obtain\n\nrelief.   I write separately only to lament the double standard we\n\napply. It is with monotonous regularity that we dispatch claims of\n\nimmigration petitioners who have failed to meet one filing deadline\n\nor another.1   That outcome is sometimes dictated by law.   Yet, when\n\na successful plaintiff attempts to get relief provided by the law\n\nby seeking $4,270.94 in attorney's fees incurred while forcing the\n\ngovernment to adjudicate his much-delayed application, this Court\n\nuses exceptional en banc procedures to reverse the award.2        Even\n\nestablished rules do not seem to influence this Court when it seeks\n\n\n\n     1\n          See, e.g., Chedad v. Gonzales, 497 F.3d 57, 66 (1st Cir.\n2007) (rejecting an immigrant's claim to adjustment of status by\nrefusing to toll the time period for voluntary departure while a\nmotion to reopen was pending), overruled by Dada v. Mukasey, 128 S.\nCt. 2307 (2008); Sharari v. Gonzales, 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st Cir.\n2005)   (explaining   limitation   on  judicial   review   of   BIA\ndeterminations regarding timeliness of asylum applications); Zhang\nv. INS, 348 F.3d 289, 292 (1st Cir. 2003) (explaining the strict\njurisdictional   timing   requirements   on   appeals   of   asylum\napplications and limitation on tolling).\n     2\n          See also United States v. Vega-Santiago, 519 F.3d 1, 7\n(1st Cir. 2008) (en banc) (Torruella, J., dissenting).\n\n\n                                 -33-\n\fto expand government power or shield federal agencies from the\n\nconsequences of their own failings.           Instead, this Court adopts\n\namorphous     policy   interests    alleged   by    the   government   through\n\nbombastic exaggeration and doomsday predictions in its en banc\n\npetition.      See Majority Opinion at p. 4 (citing USCIS's argument\n\nthat   the     panel   opinion      would   have    \"dangerous      systematic\n\nconsequences far beyond this case\" and would be an \"'enormous\n\ndisincentive for the agency to settle these cases'\").\n\n              On the issue of whether Aronov was a prevailing party,\n\nthe majority ignores our sensible precedent that we defer to a\n\ndistrict court on the meaning of its own orders.              See New England\n\nRegional Council of Carpenters v. Kinton, 284 F.3d 9, 39 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (affirming a denial of attorney's fees against Massport).\n\nThe majority then proceeds to resolve the issue without itself\n\nbothering to decide the jurisdictional effect of the district\n\ncourt's     order.     In   other    words,   the     majority     adopts    the\n\ngovernment's position on imprimatur without deciding whether USCIS\n\nwas free to act without the district court's explicit approval of\n\nthe parties' proposed course of action.             The majority     concludes\n\nthat   even    assuming   the   district    court's   order    constituted     a\n\ntransfer of its exclusive jurisdiction back to USCIS, the district\n\ncourt's decision was not a consideration of the merits.                     This\n\nconclusion replaces the district court's own explanation of its\n\norder with an assumption that the district court exercised its\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\fpower to remand without consideration. Such a conclusion is unfair\n\nto our district courts and is not even supported by the precedent\n\non which the majority relies.           See Rice Servs., Ltd. v. United\n\nStates,   405   F.3d   1017,   1025   (Fed.   Cir.   2005)   (stating   that,\n\ndepending on the context and effect of the order, a remand to an\n\nadministrative agency can constitute prevailing on the merits).\n\nHere, where the remand order effectively mandated the relief Aronov\n\nsought and changed the jurisdictional landscape such that that\n\nrelief could be awarded, the majority must strain to avoid seeing\n\njudicial imprimatur.3\n\n           Similarly, in supporting its ruling for the government on\n\nthis issue, the majority effectively says that district courts do\n\nnot have authority to sanction parties that fail to comply when the\n\ncourt allows a clear and unambiguous motion seeking to compel some\n\n\n\n     3\n          In this regard, I see the Tenth Circuit's recent decision\nas indistinguishable from the present case on the prevailing party\nissue. See Al-Maleki v. Holder, No. 07-4260, 2009 WL 692612 (10th\nCir. Mar. 18, 2009). The majority simultaneously admits that the\ndecision may be contrary to its view while attempting to\ndistinguish it on the thinnest of grounds. That the remand order\nin that case was slightly more detailed and that more litigation\nhad transpired before the remand order cannot be sufficient to\ndistinguish Al-Maleki. Id. at *3. These differences in formatting\nare not relevant to the effect and force of the remand order or to\nthe Tenth Circuit's conclusion that the government's catalyst\narguments were unconvincing. Id. Rather the functional posture of\nboth cases is the same: the district court agreed with the parties\njoint request for remand for the purpose of allowing the\nplaintiff's application.     Thus, the majority adoption of the\ngovernment's position that Al-Maleki is distinguishable is\nstrained, elevates form over function, and effectively does create\na circuit split.\n\n                                      -35-\n\fspecific   action.          This    extension        of    the   rule   that    formal\n\ninjunctions must not incorporate other documents by reference, see\n\nFed. R Civ. P. 65(d), seems to me to be both questionable and\n\ncumbersome.    Nonetheless, the majority unhesitatingly adopts it to\n\nsupport the government's position.\n\n           Finally, on the issue of substantial justification, the\n\nmajority   again     reaches       to   support      the   government's    position.\n\nThough the agency's own regulation spells out a clear rule --\n\ndecisions must be made within 120 days of the initial examination\n\n-- the majority calls the agency's violation of its own rule\n\nreasonable.     Specifically, to avoid granting Aronov relief, the\n\nmajority relies on the government's attenuated insinuations that\n\nour national security will be threatened by ruling against it. But\n\nAronov's modest request for attorney's fees does not seek to\n\nprevent the government from performing background checks.                       Rather\n\nhe seeks only to recover the costs he was forced to incur to obtain\n\nadjudication of his petition after an excessive delay attributable\n\nto   backlog   and   a   failure        to    follow   protocol.        Only   through\n\nacquiescence    to    the    government's           policy   suggestions       can   the\n\nmajority conclude that it would be unreasonable to expect USCIS to\n\nconduct the necessary background checks while complying with its\n\nown timing regulations.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -36-\n\f           With due respect, I suggest that our jurisprudence would\n\nbetter reflect the time-honored motto, \"Equal justice under law,\"4\n\nif we showed the same doctrinal flexibility and credulity to policy\n\narguments presented by citizens asking us to limit governmental\n\npower, or for compensation for harm caused by governmental error,\n\nas shown by the majority to the government in this appeal.               For\n\nthese    reasons,   and   the   reasons   stated   by   Judge   Lipez,     I\n\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n                     -Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n     4\n          As appears engraved on the building housing the Supreme\nCourt of the United States.\n\n                                   -37-\n\f              LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, with whom TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge,\n\njoins, dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the decision of the\n\nmajority      narrowing    the   class    of   plaintiffs     who   can   obtain\n\nattorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (\"EAJA\").\n\nWith its strangely dismissive view of a decision of the district\n\ncourt explaining why Aronov is a prevailing party, the majority\n\nrefuses to accord that status to an immigrant who, facing a\n\nsubstantial     delay     in   the   processing   of   his    application    for\n\nnaturalization, exercised his statutory right to sue the U.S.\n\nCitizenship and Immigration Service (\"USCIS\") and obtained an order\n\nfrom the district court remanding the matter to USCIS so that he\n\ncould be made a citizen.         Invoking national security concerns that\n\nare     not    implicated      here,     the   majority      characterizes    as\n\nsubstantially justified the conduct of USCIS, whose delay in\n\nprocessing the naturalization application was both contrary to\n\nstatute and to its own regulations.            These legal conclusions are\n\nunwarranted, unwise, and contrary to the purpose and promise of the\n\nEAJA.\n\n                                         I.\n\n              The facts of this case are straightforward.                 Aronov\n\napplied for naturalization with the Vermont Service Center of USCIS\n\non May 22, 2004.     On February 14, 2005, USCIS conducted an initial\n\nexamination of Aronov regarding his application. As the government\n\nacknowledges, the agency's interview with Aronov was premature.\n\n\n                                       -38-\n\fUSCIS's own regulation dictates that an initial examination should\n\nbe undertaken only after an applicant's full background check has\n\nbeen   completed.      8    C.F.R.    §   335.2(b).     After    Aronov   was\n\ninterviewed,    federal     law    required    USCIS   to   adjudicate    his\n\napplication within 120 days.          See 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b); 8 C.F.R. §\n\n335.3(a).    Aronov heard nothing from USCIS for over a year.             He\n\nmade repeated inquiries about the status of his application.               On\n\nMarch 23, 2006, 402 days after his examination, Aronov received a\n\nletter from the agency requesting six months more to complete\n\nadditional review.     At that time, Aronov's statutory right to sue\n\nUSCIS in federal district court to compel action on his application\n\nhad already accrued.       See 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b).     On August 28, 2006,\n\n560 days afer his initial examination, and 440 days past USCIS's\n\ndeadline for adjudicating the application, Aronov filed suit.\n\n            Thirty-nine     days     later,   the   background   check    was\n\ncomplete.    On October 6, 2006, the government and Aronov filed a\n\nJoint Motion for Remand Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b).            In full,\n\nthe joint motion read:\n\n            Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b), the parties in\n            this action, plaintiff . . . and defendants\n            Michael Chertoff, Secretary of the United\n            States Department of Homeland Security, et\n            al., hereby jointly move this Honorable Court\n            to remand this matter to the USCIS, so that\n            [it] can grant plaintiff's application for\n            naturalization, and schedule plaintiff's oath\n            ceremony for no later than November 8, 2006.\n            In support of this motion, the parties state\n            as follows:\n\n\n                                      -39-\n\f                 1.   On or about August 28, 2006,\n          plaintiff Alexandre Aronov filed this action.\n                 2.   Since    that   date,   USCIS   has\n          completed    its    review    of    plaintiff's\n          application   for    naturalization   and,   if\n          jurisdiction is returned to the agency, would\n          grant the application and schedule plaintiff's\n          oath ceremony for no later than November 8,\n          2006.\n                 3.   The governing statute, 8 U.S.C. §\n          1447(b), provides that, in cases in which the\n          agency has failed to render a decision on an\n          application for naturalization within 120 days\n          of the examination of the applicant, the\n          applicant may file suit in district court\n          requesting to adjudicate the application and\n          \"[s]uch court has jurisdiction over the matter\n          and may either determine the matter or remand\n          the matter, with appropriate instructions, to\n          the Service to determine the matter.\"\n\n                 Wherefore, with good cause having been\n          shown, the parties respectfully request that\n          this Court remand this matter to USCIS so that\n          it can grant plaintiff's application for\n          naturalization and schedule plaintiff for an\n          oath ceremony for no later than November 8,\n          2006.\n\n          On October 12, 2006, the court entered an electronic\n\norder granting the motion and the remand.   The docket text for the\n\nremand order states: \"Judge Nancy Gertner: Electronic ORDER entered\n\ngranting 3 Joint Motion to Remand to US Citizenship and Immigration\n\nServices.\"1\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          The \"3\" references the docket number of the joint motion\nand was hyperlinked to the joint motion's text.\n\n                               -40-\n\f            On November 28, 2006, Aronov filed an application for\n\nattorney's fees pursuant to the EAJA.2              The government opposed\n\nAronov's application, asserting that he was not a prevailing party\n\nin the litigation under the test established in Buckhannon Board\n\nand Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health and Human\n\nResources, 532 U.S. 598 (2001), and that the government's position\n\nregarding    his   application    was    substantially       justified.        The\n\ndistrict court agreed with Aronov and ordered the government to pay\n\nhim $4,270.94 in attorney's fees and costs.                 In its order, the\n\ndistrict court explained the significance of its October 12 remand\n\norder, stating, \"the government here was granted not a dismissal,\n\nbut   a   remand   to   the   agency    conditional    on    the    granting   of\n\nplaintiff's    naturalization      by    November     8,    2006.      Had     the\n\nnaturalization not so occurred, the parties might very well be back\n\nin front of this Court litigating a contempt action.\"                 Aronov v.\n\n\n      2\n            The EAJA provides:\n\n            Except as otherwise specifically provided by\n            statute, a court shall award to a prevailing\n            party other than the United States fees and\n            other expenses, in addition to any costs\n            awarded pursuant to subsection (a), incurred\n            by that party in any civil action (other than\n            cases sounding in tort), including proceedings\n            for judicial review of agency action, brought\n            by or against the United States in any court\n            having jurisdiction of that action, unless the\n            court finds that the position of the United\n            States was substantially justified or that\n            special circumstances make an award unjust.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A).\n\n                                       -41-\n\fChertoff, No. 06-11526, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40455, at *5 (D.\n\nMass. Jan. 30, 2007) (emphasis in original).            A timely appeal by\n\nthe government followed.   A panel of the court affirmed the award.\n\nAronov v. Chertoff, 536 F.3d 30 (1st Cir. 2008).           Subsequently, a\n\nmajority of the en banc court granted the government's petition for\n\nrehearing en banc, vacating the panel opinion.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          Although parties are ordinarily required, win or lose, to\n\nbear their own attorney's fees, see, e.g., Alyeska Pipeline Serv.\n\nCo. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421 U.S. 240, 247 (1975), a number of\n\nexceptions to this default rule have been adopted by statute.            One\n\nsuch exception, the EAJA, authorizes an award of attorney's fees\n\nand costs to a litigant who has brought a civil suit against the\n\nUnited States if (1) she is the prevailing party in the matter; (2)\n\nthe government fails to show that its position was substantially\n\njustified; and (3) no special circumstances would make such an\n\naward unjust. 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A); see also Schock v. United\n\nStates, 254 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2001).           By offering qualifying\n\nlitigants attorney's fees and other expenses, the EAJA seeks \"to\n\nremove   economic   deterrents   to    parties    who    seek   review    of\n\nunreasonable government action.\"      Schock, 254 F.3d at 4.\n\n          The court reviews the district court's decision to grant\n\nor deny a fee application under the EAJA for abuse of discretion,\n\nid., \"mindful that the district court has an 'intimate knowledge of\n\n\n                                 -42-\n\fthe nuances of the underlying case,'\"           New Eng. Reg'l Council of\n\nCarpenters v. Kinton, 284 F.3d 9, 30 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Gay\n\nOfficers Action League v. Puerto Rico, 247 F.3d 288, 292 (1st Cir.\n\n2001)).       \"Such deference is particularly appropriate where, as\n\nhere, the correctness of the court's decision depends in large part\n\non the proper characterization of its own statements.\"             Id.\n\nA. Prevailing Party\n\n              The Supreme Court has long held that a plaintiff who\n\nobtains   a    \"settlement   agreement[]      enforced   through   a   consent\n\ndecree\" is a \"prevailing party.\"        See Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 604\n\n(citing Maher v. Gagne, 448 U.S. 122 (1980)).            In cases following\n\nBuckhannon,     most   courts   have   also    permitted   fees    where   the\n\nplaintiff obtains an order equivalent to a consent decree.                 See\n\nRoberson v. Giuliani, 346 F.3d 75, 81-82 (2d Cir. 2003) (noting the\n\nagreement of a majority of appellate courts).              For example, the\n\nFourth Circuit held that orders lacking the title \"consent decree\"\n\nsupport an award if they are \"functionally a consent decree,\" Smyth\n\nex rel. Smyth v. Rivero, 282 F.3d 268, 281 (4th Cir. 2002), a\n\nformulation we have also employed.            See Smith v. Fitchburg Pub.\n\nSchs., 401 F.3d 16, 24 (1st Cir. 2005); see also Rice Servs., Ltd.\n\nv. United States, 405 F.3d 1017, 1025 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (court\n\naction \"equivalent\" to a consent decree or judgment on the merits);\n\nT.D. v. LaGrange Sch. Dist. No. 102, 349 F.3d 469, 478 (7th Cir.\n\n2003) (settlements \"sufficiently analogous\" to consent decrees).\n\n\n                                   -43-\n\f            Given the posture of the underlying litigation, the\n\nquestion in this case is whether the district court's remand order\n\nis functionally equivalent to a consent decree.            If the order is\n\nfunctionally equivalent to a consent decree, then a fortiori it\n\npossesses    whatever   \"judicial      imprimatur\"    a    consent   decree\n\npossesses, see Buckhannon, 532 U.S. 605, and the order makes Aronov\n\na prevailing party.      According to the majority, \"three related\n\nfactors\"    must   characterize   an   order   that   is   the   functional\n\nequivalent of a consent decree.         First, there must be a \"court-\n\nordered\" change in the legal relationship resulting from the\n\nunderlying litigation. Second, \"there must be judicial approval of\n\nthe relief vis-a-vis the merits of the case.\"         Third, there must be\n\n\"judicial oversight and ability to enforce the obligations imposed\n\non the parties.\"      These factors must all be present if a court\n\norder is to constitute the functional equivalent of a consent\n\ndecree. According to the majority, none of the factors was present\n\nhere.\n\n            The majority is wrong.       All three factors were present\n\nhere.   The change in legal relationship between USCIS and Aronov\n\nwas court-ordered.       The court satisfied the requirements for\n\napproval of a consent decree, which do not require the court to\n\nstate explicitly that it has approved the relief in relation to the\n\nmerits of the case.      Lastly, the court retained jurisdiction to\n\n\n\n\n                                  -44-\n\fenforce the agreement by incorporating the terms of the joint\n\nmotion into the remand order.\n\n              1. The change in legal relationship was court-ordered\n\n              During the litigation, only the district court possessed\n\nthe authority to give Aronov the relief he requested. After Aronov\n\nfiled suit, USCIS lost jurisdiction to adjudicate his application,\n\nthereby precluding USCIS from naturalizing Aronov without further\n\ncourt       involvement.     8   U.S.C.   §   1447(b)    (\"Such   court   has\n\njurisdiction over the matter and may either determine the matter or\n\nremand the matter, with appropriate instructions, to the [USCIS] to\n\ndetermine the matter.\"); see Etape v. Chertoff, 497 F.3d 379, 384-\n\n85 (4th Cir. 2007).        The parties acknowledged this jurisdictional\n\npoint in their joint motion for remand to the district court, which\n\nhighlights the terms of 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b).3            They understood that\n\n\n        3\n          Elsewhere parties have litigated the question of whether\nthe court maintains exclusive jurisdiction or, alternatively,\nconcurrent jurisdiction with the USCIS. Most courts have held that\nthe district court has exclusive jurisdiction over the application\nuntil it has acted pursuant to the statute. See, e.g., Etape, 497\nF.3d at 384-85 (holding that section 1447(b) vests the district\ncourt   with   exclusive   jurisdiction   over   a   naturalization\napplication); United States v. Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144, 1159 (9th\nCir. 2004) (en banc) (same).       But see, e.g., Bustamante v.\nChertoff, 533 F. Supp. 2d 373, 381 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (reaching the\nopposite conclusion).     In its initial argument to us, the\ngovernment did not suggest that USCIS maintained jurisdiction over\nAronov's application after he filed suit in district court. In the\nen banc proceedings, the government alluded to the concurrent\njurisdiction argument. Whatever the government's intent with the\nallusion, it is beside the point. The government's conduct of the\nlitigation reflected its view that it could not act on Aronov's\nnaturalization application without a remand order from the district\ncourt. Moreover, as the Tenth Circuit recently pointed out in Al-\n\n                                     -45-\n\fthere had to be an intervening judicial order before Aronov could\n\nobtain     relief.     Nothing    about    this   order    was   automatic;   the\n\ndistrict     court    had   the   discretion      to   either     determine   the\n\nnaturalization issue itself or remand to USCIS with instructions.\n\n             This is not the catalyst scenario of Buckhannon.               There,\n\nthe plaintiff alleged that West Virginia law conflicted with\n\nfederal law, 532 U.S. at 601, and the West Virginia legislature\n\nretained      its     authority      throughout          the     litigation    to\n\n\"unilateral[ly]\" amend its laws. See Smyth, 282 F.3d at 278 (using\n\nthis expression).       It exercised that authority and rendered the\n\nsuit moot, after which the government moved to dismiss the case.\n\nHere USCIS could do no such thing.                It lacked the authority to\n\n\"unilaterally\"       provide   Aronov     the   relief    he   requested.     The\n\ndistrict court's order was necessary to return authority to the\n\nagency.4\n\n\nMaleki v. Holder, No. 07-4260, 2009 WL 692612, at *3 (10th Cir.\nMar. 18, 2009), even if USCIS did retain concurrent jurisdiction\nover the application after the suit was filed, \"the district court\nresolved the litigation before USCIS could voluntarily naturalize\n[the applicant].\"   Id. (emphasis in original).     This order of\nevents distinguishes Buckhannon regardless of the jurisdictional\nquestion.\n     4\n          Contrary to the majority's suggestion, the fact that\nUSCIS acted voluntarily in coming to an agreement with Aronov does\nnot make Aronov ineligible for fees.       Voluntary conduct by a\ndefendant is a necessary part of any consent decree process.\nIndeed, as the Supreme Court has said, \"the voluntary nature of a\nconsent decree is its most fundamental characteristic.\" Local No.\n93, Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters v. City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501,\n521-22 (1986). Yet a plaintiff who obtains a consent decree is\neligible for fees. Maher, 448 U.S. at 129-30. Similarly, awarding\n\n                                        -46-\n\f            Moreover, the remand order mandated a change in the legal\n\nrelationship of the parties -- namely, that Aronov's status change\n\nfrom alien to citizen through an oath ceremony that would take\n\nplace no later than November 8, 2006.         According to the court, it\n\n\"remanded   specifically   'so   that    USCIS   can     grant   plaintiff's\n\napplication   for   naturalization,     and   schedule    plaintiff's   oath\n\nceremony for no later than November 8, 2006.'\"           Aronov, 2007 U.S.\n\nDist. LEXIS 40455, at *4 (quoting Joint Mot. to Remand).            There is\n\nno mistaking the district court's meaning here.           Its remand order\n\nincorporated by reference the joint motion of the parties and\n\nthereby ordered USCIS to fulfill the promise that it made to Aronov\n\nand the court in the joint motion.       This was the district court's\n\nown understanding of its order.       See id. at *4-5.\n\n            A district court is in the best position to explain the\n\nmeaning of its own order.        We defer routinely to the district\n\ncourt's view of the significance of its remand order.            See Kinton,\n\n284 F.3d at 30 (\"Clearly, the district court is in the best\n\nposition to determine whether its statements . . . should be\n\nconsidered as the functional equivalent of a judicial order within\n\nthe meaning of Buckhannon.\"); Harvey v. Johanns, 494 F.3d 237, 242\n\n\n\nAronov fees because the remand order is functionally equivalent to\na consent decree would not conflict with our holding in Smith. See\nSmith, 401 F.3d at 26-27 (noting the defendant's voluntary\nconduct).   The Smith panel expressly set aside as waived the\nquestion of whether the order there was functionally equivalent to\na consent decree. Id. at 24.\n\n                                  -47-\n\f(1st Cir. 2007) (\"We must, of course, accord deference to the\n\ndistrict court's interpretation of the wording of its own order.\");\n\nsee also Lefkowitz v. Fair, 816 F.2d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 1987)\n\n(\"[U]ncertainty as to the meaning and intendment of a district\n\ncourt order can sometimes best be dispelled by deference to the\n\nviews of the writing judge.\").\n\n          Here,    the     majority      dismisses   the    district    court's\n\nassessment   of   its    October    12   remand   order    in   its   subsequent\n\ndecision on attorney's fees as a \"post-hoc explanation for a prior\n\norder.\"      If   the    majority     means   that   the    district    court's\n\nexplanation is meaningless because the court could not incorporate\n\nby reference the terms of the joint motion into the remand order as\n\na matter of law, then it is incorrect.                Whether a court has\n\nincorporated an agreement into an order depends on context.                  In\n\nF.A.C., Inc. v. Cooperativa de Seguros de Vida de Puerto Rico, 449\n\nF.3d 185 (1st Cir. 2006), we held that an oral settlement agreement\n\nbetween two parties to a complex RICO dispute was not incorporated\n\ninto a dismissal order that referred to it.           Id. at 190.       However,\n\nwe expressly limited our rejection of the incorporation claim to\n\n\"the present case,\" noting, \"[h]ard and fast rules may be unwise\n\nbecause of variations in language and context.\"5                Id.\n\n\n     5\n          In F.A.C., we discussed the importance of context to the\nincorporation of a settlement agreement into a dismissal order.\nF.A.C., 449 F.3d at 190. Here we are dealing with a remand order.\nIf anything, the case for incorporating by reference the terms of\na preceding motion into a remand order is stronger than the case\n\n                                      -48-\n\f          This is a sensible approach.    District courts routinely\n\nenter orders granting a party's motion without elaboration.       The\n\nidea that such an order cannot incorporate by reference the terms\n\nof the motion to which the order responds is at odds with the daily\n\npractice of the courts. To be sure, incorporation by reference may\n\nbe inappropriate for the entry of a consent decree that addresses\n\na complex lawsuit with many issues and multiple parties.   But this\n\nis not remotely such a case.       The relief Aronov sought was\n\nstraightforward:     \"[a]djudicating     [his]    Application    for\n\nNaturalization . . . or, in the alternative, [r]equiring [USCIS] to\n\nadjudicate [his] application for naturalization.\" Only two parties\n\nwere involved.   The terms of their joint motion were clear.    There\n\nwas no impediment, legal or practical, to the incorporation of that\n\njoint motion into the district court's remand order.\n\n          One cannot examine the record below and conclude --\n\nagainst the district court's interpretation of its own remand order\n\n-- that the court did not refer to the joint motion with the intent\n\nof incorporating its terms, and with the full expectation that the\n\npromises made therein would be fulfilled.        The parties' joint\n\n\nfor incorporating by reference the terms of a settlement agreement\ninto a dismissal order.     Remand, unlike dismissal, expressly\ncontemplates an ongoing adjudication of a case by a lower court or\nadministrative agency, pursuant to the order of the remanding\ncourt. See Blacks Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004). Remanding courts\nintend, and the parties expect, the remand order to instruct the\nlower court or agency about what further proceedings should take\nplace, and orders often accomplish this by incorporation -- e.g.,\n\"We remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\"\n\n                               -49-\n\fmotion makes specific representations to the court about the action\n\nthe defendant would take.      The court's order refers to the joint\n\nmotion twice, once by name and once by docket number.           USCIS could\n\nonly understand that the court was ordering it to carry out the\n\npromise made to the court.            USCIS would naturalize Aronov by\n\nNovember 8, 2006, and thereby change his status from alien to\n\ncitizen.\n\n          2. The court satisfied the requirements for entering a\nconsent decree\n\n           The   majority   contends     that   a    district   court    must\n\n\"appraise,\" \"weigh\" or \"evaluate\" the merits of a case in relation\n\nto the relief provided by the consent decree. The requirements for\n\nentering a consent decree were recently summarized by the Supreme\n\nCourt in Frew ex rel. Frew v. Hawkins:\n\n           Consent decrees entered in federal court must\n           be directed to protecting federal interests.\n           In [Local No. 93], we observed that a federal\n           consent decree must spring from, and serve to\n           resolve, a dispute within the court's subject-\n           matter jurisdiction; must come within the\n           general scope of the case made by the\n           pleadings; and must further the objectives of\n           the law upon which the complaint was based.\n\n540 U.S. 431, 437 (2004) (citing Local No. 93, 478 U.S. at 525\n\n(collecting cases)); see also Conservation Law Found. of New Eng.,\n\nInc. v. Franklin, 989 F.2d 54, 59 (1st Cir. 1993) (listing same\n\nrequirements).     We   have   also    held   that   district   courts   must\n\ndetermine that a proposed consent decree is fair, adequate and\n\nreasonable before entering it.         For example, in Conservation Law\n\n                                  -50-\n\fFoundation, we wrote, \"[d]istrict courts must review a consent\n\ndecree to ensure that it is 'fair, adequate, and reasonable; that\n\nthe proposed decree will not violate the Constitution, a statute or\n\nother authority; [and] that it is consistent with the objectives of\n\nCongress . . . .'\"       989 F.2d at 58 (quoting Durrett v. Housing\n\nAuth. of Providence, 896 F.2d 600, 604 (1st Cir. 1990)); see also\n\nUnited States v. City of Miami, 664 F.2d 435, 441 (Former 5th Cir.\n\n1981).\n\n           We agree that it would be difficult for a district court\n\nto   determine   the   fairness,   reasonableness   and   adequacy   of   a\n\nproposed agreement without making some evaluation of the merits of\n\nthe case in relation to the relief provided by the consent decree.\n\nHowever, \"how deeply the judge must inquire, what factors he must\n\ntake into account, and what weight he should give the settling\n\nparties' desires will vary with the circumstances.\"           Donovan v.\n\nRobbins, 752 F.2d 1170, 1177 (7th Cir. 1984); see also United\n\nStates v. Charles George Trucking, Inc., 34 F.3d 1081, 1088 (1st\n\nCir. 1994) (holding that the substance of the fairness inquiry will\n\ndepend on the context).      Moreover, neither Frew nor Conservation\n\nLaw Foundation require that a judge explicitly state, in the\n\ncourt's order or elsewhere on the record, that she has determined\n\nthat a proposed agreement meets these requirements.        See Frew, 540\n\nU.S. at 437; Conservation Law Found., 989 F.2d at 58 (holding that\n\na court must \"review\" a proposed consent decree).         As a reviewing\n\n\n                                   -51-\n\fcourt, we assume that a judge understands the role the district\n\ncourt is supposed to play in deciding whether to enter a consent\n\ndecree,   and    that    the    judge     acts   in   accordance   with   that\n\nunderstanding.     As we explained previously regarding this very\n\nissue,\n\n          the question is whether the record contains\n          adequate facts to support the decision of the\n          district court to approve the proposed\n          compromise. As to this, as the Supreme Court\n          has observed, \"a reviewing court would be\n          properly reluctant to attack that action\n          solely because the court failed adequately to\n          set forth its reasons or the evidence on which\n          they were based.\"\n\nUnited States v. Comunidades Unidas Contra La Contaminacion, 204\n\nF.3d 275, 280 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting Protective Comm. for Indep.\n\nStockholders of TMT Trailer Ferry, Inc. v. Anderson, 390 U.S. 414,\n\n437 (1968)).\n\n          Here, the record \"contain[s] adequate facts to support\n\nthe   decision    of    the    trial    court    to   approve   the   proposed\n\ncompromise[].\"     TMT Trailer Ferry, 390 U.S. at 437.             Again, the\n\ncontext is simple.       There is one plaintiff, one government agency,\n\nand a specific form of relief that is being sought.             The judge had\n\nthe benefit of both the complaint and the parties' joint motion for\n\nremand.   The complaint identified the factual and legal bases for\n\nproviding relief. The joint motion isolated the relevant facts and\n\nlaw, and asserted \"good cause\" for remanding to the agency for\n\nnaturalization.        From these documents, the district court could\n\n\n                                        -52-\n\freadily evaluate the merits of Aronov's claim in relation to the\n\nrelief described in the joint motion, and determine that the\n\njointly proposed agreement was \"fair, adequate, and reasonable.\"6\n\nThe court also could determine that it met the requirements imposed\n\nby Frew.    In short, the record contains adequate facts to support\n\nthe   court's     decision   to   approve   the   proposed    agreement     and\n\nincorporate it in an order of the court, and there is no reason to\n\nassume, as the majority apparently does, that the court failed to\n\nmake the necessary determination.\n\n            3.    The   court   retained    jurisdiction     to   enforce   the\nagreement\n\n            The majority argues that the district court's order \"did\n\nnot contain provisions for future enforcement typical of consent\n\ndecrees.\"        But a consent decree need not contain a separate\n\nprovision explicitly retaining jurisdiction for future enforcement.\n\nWe have held that if the terms of an agreement are incorporated\n\n\n\n      6\n          There is no legal support for the majority's contention\nthat a defendant must file an answer or \"raise defenses\" before a\nconsent decree (or its equivalent) may be entered by a federal\ncourt. Consent decrees may be entered at any stage of litigation,\nand are regularly entered before a defendant has filed an answer.\nSee Maimon Schwarzschild, Public Law by Private Bargain: Title VII\nConsent Decrees and the Fairness of Negotiated Institutional\nReform, 1984 Duke L.J. 887, 913 (noting that parties often\nnegotiate consent decrees before the complaint is filed, and that\nduring the period of study nearly one-third of Title VII consent\ndecrees involving the Department of Justice and public employers\nwere entered the day the complaint was filed). Here, in contrast,\nboth parties filed documents with the court. The joint character\nof the motion for remand provided the court a reasonable basis for\nevaluating the merits of the case.\n\n                                     -53-\n\finto an order, the district court retains jurisdiction to enforce\n\nthat agreement.   Smith, 401 F.3d at 24 (\"'Either incorporation of\n\nthe terms of the agreement or a separate provision retaining\n\njurisdiction   over   the   agreement   will   suffice   [to   retain\n\njurisdiction to enforce the agreement].'\" (quoting Smyth, 282 F.3d\n\nat 283)); see also Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511\n\nU.S. 375, 381 (1994) (stating this proposition for dismissal\n\norders).7   Here, the district court incorporated by reference the\n\nterms of the joint motion.    This incorporation was sufficient to\n\nretain jurisdiction for purposes of future enforcement.8\n\n\n     7\n          The majority's statement that \"it is also firmly the law\nthat there must be a clear basis within the order . . . for both\nthe court's continuing jurisdiction and its power to enforce an\nagreement between the parties\" demonstrates its refusal to accept\nSmith, which states that incorporation of a settlement agreement in\nan order is sufficient for purposes of retaining jurisdiction to\nenforce that agreement. Smith, 401 F.3d at 24. We have also said\nthat \"hard and fast rules may be unwise [on the question of\nincorporation] because of variations in language and context.\"\nF.A.C., 449 F.3d at 190; see supra section II(A)(1).       The only\nauthority the majority cites in support of its view, Kokkonen, does\nnot support it.    Indeed, the language \"clear basis within the\norder\" appears nowhere in Kokkonen. See Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 379-\n82. In fact, as several courts have noted, Kokkonen is silent on\nwhether reference suffices to incorporate an agreement for purposes\nof retaining jurisdiction. See, e.g., Hospitality House, Inc. v.\nGilbert, 298 F.3d 424, 431-32 (5th Cir. 2002) (\"[T]he Kokkonen\nCourt did not explicitly hold that a district court's order of\ndismissal must contain an express statement incorporating a\nsettlement agreement in order to vest the court with ancillary\njurisdiction . . . .\"); Lucille v. City of Chicago, 31 F.3d 546,\n549 (7th Cir. 1994) (Cudahy, J., concurring).\n     8\n          To determine whether the remand order was the functional\nequivalent of a consent decree, I need not decide whether the\nremand order itself satisfied the procedural requirements necessary\nfor injunctions or to support a motion for contempt. See Fed. R.\n\n                                -54-\n\f          4. The district court's             order       was    the   functional\nequivalent of a consent decree\n\n              In summary, the change in legal relationship between\n\nUSCIS and Aronov was mandated by the remand order that incorporated\n\nUSCIS's representation that it would naturalize Aronov by a certain\n\ndate.    The law does not require that the district court state\n\nexplicitly that it has evaluated the fairness, reasonableness, and\n\nadequacy of a proposed consent decree.             It is enough if the record\n\nwould permit the district court to make that evaluation.                     The\n\nrecord   in    this   simple   case   is   ample    for   that    purpose.     By\n\nincorporating the parties' joint motion, the remand order provided\n\n\nCiv. P. 65(d) (discussing form of order); United States v.\nSaccoccia, 433 F.3d 19, 28 (1st Cir. 2005) (requiring terms to be\nclear and unambiguous).    The crucial question, as the majority\nacknowledges, is whether the district court retained jurisdiction\nover the agreement. The remand order did this by incorporating the\nterms of the joint motion by reference. Given this circumstance,\nif USCIS had failed to comply with the remand order, Aronov could\nhave asked the court to issue an injunction confirming the\nnaturalization obligation of USCIS and ordering compliance with it.\nCourts routinely issue supplemental orders to enforce a consent\ndecree as a prelude to the invocation of contempt authority. See,\ne.g., King v. Greenblatt, 127 F.3d 190, 192 n.5 (1st cir. 1997)\n(describing the district court's issuance of injunctions \"to\nimplement the thrust of the earlier consent decree\"). The majority\nfails to recognize the distinction between consent decrees and\ninjunctions. It suggests wrongly that I have characterized the\ndistrict court \"as having essentially issued an injunction.\" That\nis not so. I have concluded that the district court entered the\nfunctional equivalent of a consent decree.          There are key\ndifferences between consent decrees and injunctions -- the\nviability of incorporation by reference being a principal one. The\nmajority appears to believe that any order that does not meet the\nheightened standards applicable to injunctions and the contempt\nsanction \"does not order [the parties] to do anything\" and leaves\nthe issuing court powerless to enforce the order.           Such a\nconclusion belies the law and common sense.\n\n                                      -55-\n\fa continuing basis for enforcing the agreement if USCIS did not\n\ncomply with its representations to the court.            Thus, the court's\n\nremand order was the functional equivalent of a consent decree, and\n\nAronov was a prevailing party.9\n\nB. Substantial Justification\n\n            In addressing the \"substantial justification\" issue, the\n\nmajority announces a broad rule to protect USCIS's authority to\n\nmake policy choices favoring national security interests.              As I\n\nwill explain, no such authority is at issue.         The question is much\n\nnarrower:   whether   the   delay   in     this   case   was   substantially\n\njustified, in light of the fact that USCIS exceeded both the\n\nstatutory and regulatory deadlines governing the naturalization\n\nprocess.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n          The Tenth Circuit's recent decision in Al-Maleki, 2009 WL\n692612, at *2-3, affirmed an award of attorney's fees under EAJA to\na naturalization applicant who had filed suit under section 1447(b)\nafter there was a substantial delay in the adjudication of his\napplication.   The court's prevailing party analysis is strongly\nsupportive of my analysis here. As I have already noted, supra\nnote 4, the court distinguished Buckhannon on the grounds that the\ndistrict court had resolved the litigation in favor of the\napplicant before USCIS naturalized him. Id. at *3. Moreover, the\napplicant, like Aronov, had submitted a joint motion with USCIS\nrepresenting to the court that USCIS would naturalize him by a\ncertain date. Id. The Tenth Circuit noted that the court's order\nwas \"bas[ed] . . . [on] the parties' stipulations\" in the joint\nmotion, and that the order was judicially enforceable against USCIS\nif the agency failed to comply. Id. Entry of such an order, the\nTenth Circuit said, \"not USCIS's stipulation, was the action which\nindelibly alter[ed] the legal landscape between USCIS and [the\napplicant].\" Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nThis order sufficed to make the applicant a prevailing party.\n\n                                    -56-\n\f           The government bears the burden of demonstrating that its\n\nposition was substantially justified. Schock v. United States, 254\n\nF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2001).          The Supreme Court has interpreted the\n\n\"substantially    justified\"        language     in    the    EAJA    to    require\n\nreasonableness: \"[A]s between the two commonly used connotations of\n\nthe word 'substantially,' the one most naturally conveyed by the\n\nphrase before us here is not 'justified to a high degree,' but\n\nrather   'justified    in    substance     or    in   the    main'   --    that   is,\n\njustified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.\"\n\nPierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 565 (1988); see also Schock, 254\n\nF.3d at 5; Dantran, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Labor, 246 F.3d 36, 40-41\n\n(1st   Cir.   2001).        Thus,    the   key    question      is   whether      the\n\ngovernment's position has \"a reasonable basis in law and fact.\"\n\nPierce, 487 U.S. at 566 n.2.\n\n           The majority argues that the government's pre-litigation\n\nposition insisting on compliance with the name check policy is\n\nsubstantially justified because it \"stemmed from two statutory\n\nmandates under which it must operate,\" and because that policy has\n\nsince been endorsed by Congress.             The first statute, 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1446(a), provides that \"[b]efore a person may be naturalized, an\n\nemployee of the [USCIS], or of the United States designated by the\n\nAttorney General, shall conduct a personal investigation of the\n\nperson applying for naturalization.\"             The second mandate cited by\n\nthe majority, the 1998 Appropriations Act, states: \"During fiscal\n\n\n                                      -57-\n\fyear 1998 and each fiscal year thereafter, none of the funds\n\nappropriated or otherwise made available to [USCIS] shall be used\n\nto complete adjudication of an application for naturalization\n\nunless [USCIS] has received confirmation from the Federal Bureau of\n\nInvestigation that a full criminal background check has been\n\ncompleted . . . .\"        Depts. of Commerce, Justice & State, The\n\nJudiciary & Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1998, Pub. L.\n\nNo. 105-119, 111 Stat. 2440, 2448-49 (1997) (8 U.S.C. § 1446 note).\n\nThe majority also suggests that \"Congress has since essentially\n\nendorsed   USCIS's   choice    to     use    FBI   name   checks    .    .   .   by\n\nappropriating $20 million to USCIS to 'address backlogs . . ..'\"\n\nSee Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-161,\n\n121 Stat. 1844 (2007).\n\n           Relying on Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources\n\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-45 (1984), the majority\n\nasserts that the court must defer to USCIS's decision to employ the\n\nNNCP   check   because   in   these    statutes    Congress   has       committed\n\ndecision-making authority to the agency on these issues.                         The\n\nagency has concluded, it says, that the comprehensive FBI name\n\nchecks are \"essential\" to the background investigations.                 Although\n\na small percentage of name checks take a considerable amount of\n\ntime to complete, isolated delays should not prevent the government\n\nfrom maintaining the name check requirement as its policy.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -58-\n\f          This argument misconstrues what is at stake in this case.\n\nThere is no challenge to the authority of USCIS to adopt the name\n\ncheck program as a policy.   What is challenged is the application\n\nof that policy in this instance.      Even if USCIS is entitled to\n\ninvoke Chevron to defend its use generally of the FBI name check\n\nprocess, see generally Cass Sunstein, Chevron Step Zero, 92 Va. L.\n\nRev. 187 (2006) (analyzing the standards for determining whether an\n\nagency interpretation is entitled to evaluation under the Chevron\n\nframework), deference to the general policy does not imply that the\n\ngovernment was substantially justified in its dilatory handling of\n\nAronov's naturalization application.\n\n          The government's 440-day delay in acting on Aronov's\n\nnaturalization application exceeded the deadline imposed by section\n\n1447(b), which gives a district court jurisdiction to entertain a\n\nlawsuit by the applicant and evaluate a naturalization application\n\nif the agency has failed to adjudicate the application within 120\n\ndays after conducting its initial examination. See Etape, 497 F.3d\n\nat 385; see also Hovsepian, 359 F.3d at 1163 (\"A central purpose of\n\n[section 1447(b)] was to reduce the waiting time for naturalization\n\napplicants.\" (citing H.R. Rep. No. 101-187, at 8 (1989); 135 Cong.\n\nRec. H4539-02, H4542 (1989) (statement of Rep. Morrison))).   Both\n\nthe courts and the agency itself have interpreted section 1447(b)\n\nas imposing a 120-day deadline for agency action.   See, e.g., Al-\n\nMaleki, 2009 WL 692612, at *5 (treating statute as imposing a\n\n\n                               -59-\n\fdeadline); Hovsepian, 359 F.3d at 1161; 8 C.F.R. § 335.3(a) (\"A\n\ndecision to grant or deny the application shall be made at the time\n\nof the initial examination or within 120-days after the date of the\n\ninitial examination of the applicant for naturalization . . . .\")\n\n(emphasis added); see also Walji v. Gonzales, 500 F.3d 432, 439\n\n(5th Cir. 2007) (\"[B]ecause the clear intent of Congress was to\n\naccelerate   naturalization   applications,   and   the   statutory   and\n\nregulatory language gives a definite time frame for decision once\n\nan examination has occurred, [§ 1447] is violated in situations\n\n[where the 120-day deadline is not met].\").\n\n          The majority's contention that the statute does not\n\ncommand USCIS to act within the deadline is untenable.         Although\n\nthe majority acknowledges that the agency has adopted a regulation,\n\n8 C.F.R. § 335.3(a), that treats the 120-day time frame as a\n\ndeadline, the majority regards the statutory and regulatory frame\n\nas merely aspirational, with no consequences for the agency if it\n\nfails to comply.10   If Congress had taken such a related view of its\n\n\n     10\n          The majority also contends that USCIS \"could reasonably\nbelieve it does not violate the statute by not acting within 120\ndays on the grounds that the statute does not command it to act\nwithin the deadline.\"    The agency's own regulations belie this\nclaim. As noted, part 335.3(a) expressly treats the 120-day time\nframe as a deadline.    Moreover, as a matter of policy, if the\nnaturalization applicant goes to the trouble of filing a lawsuit\nseeking mandamus on the basis that the 120-day deadline has\nexpired, the agency will capitulate and expedite the FBI name check\nrequest. According to a document entitled \"FBI Name Check Expedite\nCriteria,\" which Aronov attached to his Reply to the government's\nResponse to his Motion for attorney's fees, \"In order for USCIS to\nexpedite an FBI Name Check request, one of the following criteria\n\n                                 -60-\n\f120-day time frame, it would not have explicitly provided that an\n\napplicant whose naturalization application remains unresolved at\n\nthe end of the 120-day period may file suit in federal court to\n\nhave the application either adjudicated by the court or remanded to\n\nthe agency with instructions to adjudicate it.    See, e.g., Etape,\n\n497 F.3d at 384-85 (concluding that after an applicant has filed\n\nsuit with the district court pursuant to § 1447(b), the court has\n\nexclusive jurisdiction over the application).11\n\n\nmust be established: . . . Writ of Mandamus -- lawsuit pending in\nFederal Court.\" This policy is an unmistakable acknowledgment that\nthe petitioner invoking his or her statutory right to file suit\nunder section 1447(b) has a sound basis in law and fact for doing\nso.   It is therefore more accurate to say that the agency's\nwholesale disregard of the 120-day statutory and regulatory\ndeadline reflects its judgment that most naturalization applicants\nwhose applications are delayed beyond the 120-day statutory\ndeadline will not invoke their statutory right to sue.\n     11\n          In addition to section 1447(b)'s specific command, the\nAdministrative Procedures Act (\"APA\") offers a more general\ndirective to agencies to resolve matters presented to them within\na reasonable amount of time.     See 5 U.S.C. § 555(b) (\"With due\nregard for the convenience and necessity of the parties or their\nrepresentatives and within a reasonable time, each agency shall\nproceed to conclude a matter presented to it.\"). Our assessment of\nwhat is reasonable is informed by the relevant statutes and\nregulations.   See Towns of Wellesley, Concord and Norwood, Mass.\nv. FERC, 829 F.2d 275, 277 (1st Cir. 1987) (discussing the\nguidelines, including the existence of a \"rule of reason,\" which\ngovern the time an agency may take to make a decision) (citing\nTelecomms. Research & Action Ctr. v. FCC, 750 F.2d 70 (D.C. Cir.\n1984)); Caswell v. Califano, 583 F.2d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 1978)\n(indicating that courts may look to statutory text to provide a\nreasonable time limit on agency action). Here, section 1447(b) and\n8 C.F.R. § 335.3(a) provide such guidance. See Sze v. INS, No. C-\n97-0569 SC, 1997 WL 446236, at *7 (N.D. Cal. July 24, 1997) (\"[T]he\n120-day rule provides the court with a measure of what constitutes\na   reasonable   period   for   INS   to   process   naturalization\napplications.\").\n\n                               -61-\n\f            Moreover, the idea that the agency's early examination of\n\nAronov    was   some     sort   of   one-time   \"mistake,\"   as   the   majority\n\nsuggests, is belied by the briefs, which contain ample discussion\n\nof the \"flood\" of section 1447(b) lawsuits arising from delays in\n\nthe NNCP process.12        As they reveal, it was the agency's regular\n\npractice to violate its own regulations by examining candidates\n\nbefore receiving NNCP results, and then to compound that error by\n\nmissing the statutory and regulatory adjudication deadline, thereby\n\ngiving rise to a substantial number of lawsuits against the agency,\n\nat a cost both to taxpayers and applicants.                  USCIS engaged in\n\nprecisely that conduct in Aronov's case.               Yet, according to the\n\nmajority, this is a pre-litigation position \"justified to a degree\n\nthat could satisfy a reasonable person.\"                That is an indulgent\n\nreasonable      person    who   would   view    this   government   conduct   so\n\nbenignly.13\n\n            Finally, the majority imports national security concerns\n\ninto its defense of USCIS's handling of Aronov's application.                 It\n\nasserts sweepingly that \"the choice by USCIS to favor national\n\n\n     12\n          See Brief for American Immigration Lawyers Association,\nas Amicus Curiae in Support of Plaintiff, at 6-7.\n     13\n           I acknowledge the oddity that arises because of the\nagency's regulations. If USCIS had complied with its regulations\nand waited to interview Aronov until the FBI name check had been\ncompleted,   his   waiting  time  for   the  completion   of  the\nnaturalization process might have been longer than it was here.\nThis fact does not alter the legal analysis.     Once USCIS gave\nAronov his initial interview, it had to confront the clear timing\nobligation imposed by Congress.\n\n                                        -62-\n\fsecurity . . . regardless of whether the interview was prematurely\n\ngranted here, cannot be unreasonable.\"      There is no basis in\n\nfederal law for holding that an agency is substantially justified\n\nin ignoring its own regulations as long as it dutifully cites a\n\nnational security interest.\n\n          Moreover, the majority's invocation of these national\n\nsecurity interests reflects its continuing misapprehension of what\n\nthis case is about.   There is no challenge to the general validity\n\nof the name-check policy.     There is no suggestion that Aronov's\n\nnaturalization application should have been approved without the\n\nsecurity check that the agency deemed necessary.14     Once Aronov\n\n\n     14\n          In citing these national security interests, the majority\naccepts uncritically the relevance of the government's argument\nthat \"background checks are critical to insuring public safety and\nnational security.\" I do not dispute this proposition, which is\nirrelevant to the disposition of the case.       The majority also\naccepts uncritically the government's assertion that awarding\nAronov attorney's fees would \"create an enormous incentive for\nindividuals frustrated with delays in the naturalization process to\nfile mandamus lawsuits.\"     It is the agency itself that gives\napplicants an incentive to file suit by choosing to request\nexpedition of name checks if an applicant files suit. The agency\ncould remove this incentive by requesting expedition before a suit\nis filed, as the record shows it could. Finally, the majority also\nendorses the government's suggestion that awarding attorney's fees\nwill create a \"disincentive for the agency to settle these cases.\"\nYet   the   government   already  pursues   such   settlements   in\njurisdictions where it faces the risk of having to pay attorney's\nfees. See, e.g., Kats v. Frazier, No. Civ. 07-479, 2008 WL 2277598\n(D. Minn. May 30, 2008); Ghanim v. Mukasey, 545 F. Supp. 2d 1146\n(W.D. Wash. 2008); Phompanya v. Mukasey, No. C07-597MJP, 2008 WL\n538981 (W.D. Wash. Feb 25, 2008); Berishev v. Chertoff, 486 F.\nSupp. 2d 202 (D. Mass. 2007). The agency's decision to seek an\nearly compromise despite facing a risk of paying attorney's fees is\neasy to understand. By refusing to settle the agency would risk\nthe payment of substantially higher EAJA fees because its\n\n                                -63-\n\ffiled a lawsuit, his application was approved promptly.         Indeed,\n\nthe agency adopted a policy of giving priority to naturalization\n\napplicants who filed lawsuits pursuant to section 1447(b).          If a\n\nnaturalization applicant went through the time, trouble and expense\n\nof filing a lawsuit against the government, the applicant was moved\n\nto the head of the line.    That policy might make sense to USCIS,\n\nbut it should not be cost-free in light of the additional expense\n\nit imposes on the applicant for naturalization.15\n\n            Although I do not foreclose the possibility that the\n\ngovernment could provide substantial justification grounded in the\n\nfacts of a particular case for not complying with the 120-day\n\nstatutory   requirement,   the   government   has   advanced   no   such\n\nparticularized justification here. Instead, the agency has offered\n\n\n\nunreasonable litigation position would compound the cost of its\nunreasonable pre-litigation position.\n     15\n          This is the same conclusion reached by the Tenth Circuit\nin Al-Maleki, 2009 WL 692612, at *6-7. There the court was faced\nwith the same relevant facts: USCIS had failed to meet its 120-day\ndeadline for adjudicating an application; the applicant inquired\nabout the delay, giving the agency notice of it; the source of the\ndelay was the name check; after the applicant filed suit, USCIS\nasked the FBI to expedite the name check and adjudication was soon\nthereafter complete.     As the court pointed out, these facts\nundermine the agency's contention that it is unable to process\napplications in a timely fashion because of the backlog in name\ncheck requests. Id. at *7. Rather, USCIS has simply elected to\nignore delayed applications until a lawsuit is filed. But USCIS's\nknowledge that its statutory deadline has passed and its capacity\nto address the problem by requesting expedition of the name check\nshould motivate the agency to act before a suit is filed.       Its\ndecision to expedite requests only if it is sued \"is not reasonable\nin fact.\" See id.\n\n                                 -64-\n\fonly general justifications for the delay, including the importance\n\nof the agency's policy of requiring name checks for security\n\npurposes and the significant backlog of names that the FBI is\n\nprocessing.     These explanations, however, do not justify the\n\nagency's disregard of the clear statutory mandate. Although I also\n\nacknowledge that the agency has valid -- indeed persuasive --\n\nreasons for requiring comprehensive FBI name checks under ordinary\n\ncircumstances, that policy determination cannot justify the failure\n\nto comply with a statutory deadline.            See, e.g., Rotinsulu v.\n\nMukasey, 515 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"An agency has an\n\nobligation to abide by its own regulations.\").\n\n           Despite the agency's plaint to the contrary, USCIS was\n\nnot   caught   in   a   hopeless   bind   between   the   national   security\n\nimperatives of name check review and the 120-day statutory and\n\nregulatory deadline.       As the facts in this case demonstrate, USCIS\n\ncould have addressed the name check delay in a manner consistent\n\nwith the applicable laws and regulations, and without sacrificing\n\nnational security interests, by doing generally and more promptly\n\nexactly what it did here.          Instead of waiting for a lawsuit, the\n\nagency could have bumped applicants \"mistakenly\" interviewed before\n\ntheir name checks were completed to the front of the name check\n\nline before the 120-day deadline lapsed, saving the applicants and\n\nthe agency the expense of a lawsuit.         At the very least, in those\n\ncases where the deadline has already passed and the applicant has\n\n\n                                     -65-\n\finformed the agency of this fact, USCIS could ask the FBI for\n\nexpedited treatment of the name check.16           What the agency surely\n\ncannot do with \"substantial justification\" is blatantly ignore the\n\nrequirements imposed on it by Congress and by itself.\n\n             The majority's attempt to invoke an administrative policy\n\nto trump an explicit statutory command turns Chevron deference on\n\nits head.     See Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 44 (1993)\n\n(\"Under Chevron, if a statute is unambiguous the statute governs .\n\n. . .\" (citations omitted)).        In light of the 120-day statutory\n\ndirective, the regulatory confirmation of that directive, the\n\nagency's long delay (nearly four times the statutory period in\n\nlength), and the absence of any evidence that the government tried\n\nto expedite Aronov's application to comply with the statute until\n\nhe   sued,   the   government's   conduct     toward   Aronov   can    only   be\n\nclassified as unreasonable and not substantially justified.                   See\n\nRussell v. Nat'l Mediation Bd., 775 F.2d 1284, 1290 (5th Cir. 1985)\n\n(concluding that the government's position was not substantially\n\njustified     because   it   breached     a   clear    statutory      mandate).\n\nAccordingly, I would hold that the government was not substantially\n\njustified in its pre-litigation position.\n\n                                   III.\n\n             In order to defend the government's position and avoid\n\nthe simple truth of this case, the majority has burdened its\n\n\n      16\n             See supra notes 14, 15 and accompanying text.\n\n                                   -66-\n\fanalysis of the prevailing party issue with undue complexity, and\n\nits     analysis       of    the    substantial     justification      issue       with\n\nunwarranted national security concerns.                  After waiting through a\n\ndelay that violated statutory and regulatory deadlines by 440 days,\n\nAronov invoked his explicit statutory right to petition a district\n\ncourt to determine his naturalization application or order USCIS to\n\ndo so.    The lawsuit prompted the agency to complete the name check\n\nthat had apparently caused the delay within a few weeks of the\n\nfiling of the lawsuit.              With that process completed, the parties\n\nasked    the    court       to   remand     the   case   to   the   agency    so   the\n\nnaturalization process could be completed.                    Invoking the EAJA,\n\nAronov then successfully sought a modest award of $4,270.94 in\n\nattorney's fees from the district court for the time and trouble he\n\nincurred.           When the government appealed that award to us, a\n\nmajority of the panel ruled for Aronov.\n\n               But Aronov's time and trouble were far from over.               There\n\nwas the government's petition for en banc review, and now this.\n\nThe majority's fierce embrace of the government's opposition to\n\nthis modest award is out of all proportion to the stakes.                          Its\n\nrefusal to credit the district court's explanation of its remand\n\norder is unprecedented.                  Its invocation of national security\n\nconcerns       to    justify       the    government's    handling    of     Aronov's\n\napplication is unjustified.                We are left with a holding that is\n\n\n\n\n                                           -67-\n\fcontrary   to   the   purpose   and   the   promise   of   the   EAJA.

Instead the parties filed a joint motion to\n\nremand.     The district court issued a one-line order granting the\n\njoint motion to remand and terminating the case.                No hearing was\n\never held by the district court.         The order remanded to the USCIS,\n\nwhich swore in Aronov as a citizen on November 8, 2006, as it had\n\nrepresented in the joint motion that it would do.\n\n              Aronov, newly a citizen, then filed an application for\n\nfees and costs under the EAJA, which the district court granted in\n\nthe sum of $4,270.94, over the opposition of the USCIS.                The USCIS\n\nappealed.      The award was originally upheld by a panel, over a\n\ndissent.\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f            The USCIS sought en banc review, arguing that the panel\n\ndecision,      if    left    standing,        would   have    dangerous     systemic\n\nconsequences far beyond this case.               The precedent would \"create[]\n\nan enormous incentive for individuals frustrated with delays in the\n\nnaturalization process to file mandamus lawsuits in this Circuit;\n\n[and would] create[] an enormous disincentive for the agency to\n\nsettle these cases by agreeing to grant naturalization.\" It argued\n\nthe panel decision was contrary to law and \"undermine[d] the\n\nuniform judgment of both Congress and the agency that background\n\nchecks   are      critical    to    insuring     public      safety   and   national\n\nsecurity.\"        While the sum awarded in this case might be small, it\n\nsaid, the potential economic consequences were quite large.                    This\n\ncourt granted en banc review.1\n\n            We now reverse the award of fees and order dismissal of\n\nAronov's EAJA application with prejudice on the two separate and\n\nindependent grounds that he was not a prevailing party and that,\n\nwhether or not he met the prevailing party requirement, USCIS's\n\nposition     in     requiring      an   FBI    name   check    was    substantially\n\njustified.        The key question is not whether a court ultimately\n\nagrees with the agency's reading of its legal obligations but\n\nwhether the agency's position was substantially justified.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          We acknowledge with appreciation the assistance provided\nby the amicus American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\n                                          -4-\n\f                                I.\n\n          Aronov's suit, filed on August 28, 2006, was brought\n\nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b), which allows an applicant for citizenship\n\nto seek relief in federal district court if the USCIS does not act\n\non the application within 120 days of his or her citizenship\n\ninterview examination.   Section 1447(b) provides in full:\n\n                 If there is a failure to make a\n          determination under section 1446 of this title\n          before the end of the 120-day period after the\n          date on which the examination is conducted\n          under such section, the applicant may apply to\n          the United States district court for the\n          district in which the applicant resides for a\n          hearing on the matter. Such court has\n          jurisdiction over the matter and may either\n          determine the matter or remand the matter,\n          with appropriate instructions, to the [USCIS]\n          to determine the matter.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1447(b).\n\n          There are no disputed facts.   Aronov, a native of Russia\n\nand permanent U.S. resident since 2001, submitted an application\n\nfor citizenship to the USCIS on May 22, 2004.      On February 14,\n\n2005, a USCIS officer examined Aronov before the agency received a\n\nfull FBI background check for him, contrary to USCIS regulations.\n\nThe officer informed him that his application could not be approved\n\nuntil additional security checks were completed.\n\n          The USCIS erred by examining Aronov prematurely.      By\n\nregulation, the agency may not schedule an interview, which starts\n\nthe 120-day clock for filing suit under § 1447(b), until a full FBI\n\nbackground check for the applicant is complete.      See 8 C.F.R.\n\n                                -5-\n\f§ 335.2(b) (the USCIS will schedule interviews \"only after [it] has\n\nreceived a definitive response from the [FBI] that a full criminal\n\nbackground check of an applicant has been completed\").                   Mistakes\n\nhappen.   Nevertheless, the error was harmless2 and accrued to\n\nAronov’s benefit.      The early interview meant he was immediately\n\neligible for citizenship upon successful completion of the FBI\n\nbackground check and, under the literal terms of § 1447(b), was\n\nable to bring suit if the agency did not act on his application\n\nwithin 120 days.\n\n           On March 23, 2006, the USCIS sent Aronov written notice\n\nthat additional review of his case was necessary and asked Aronov\n\nto contact the agency if he did not receive a notice of action\n\nwithin six months.\n\n           Instead,    Aronov      sued.      The   USCIS   did    not    file    a\n\nresponsive   pleading.        On    October    6,   2006,   Aronov       and   the\n\ngovernment, having settled the case, filed a Joint Motion for\n\nRemand,   stating     that   \"USCIS    ha[d]    completed    its    review       of\n\nplaintiff's application for naturalization and, if jurisdiction\n\n[were] returned to the agency, [USCIS] would grant the application\n\nand schedule plaintiff's oath ceremony for no later than November\n\n8, 2006\" and requesting that the court \"remand the matter to USCIS\n\n\n\n     2\n          See generally Nat'l Ass'n of Home Builders v.

Indeed, Aronov never argued to the\n\ndistrict court that this situation was so like a consent decree as\n\nto constitute the requisite judicial imprimatur.         Nonetheless, the\n\nconsent decree theory is the primary grounds now asserted, and the\n\nparties have addressed the issue to the en banc court.           We bypass\n\nhis waiver and address the argument.8\n\n             The Supreme Court has described what it meant by a\n\n\"court-ordered consent decree.\"            It distinguished such consent\n\ndecrees from \"private settlements\" (as to which fees may not be\n\nawarded), saying \"[p]rivate settlements do not entail the judicial\n\napproval and oversight involved in consent decrees.\"            Id. at 604\n\nn.7.       Buckhannon contrasted final judgments on the merits and\n\ncourt-ordered consent decrees with situations which failed to meet\n\nthe judicial imprimatur test: for example, securing the reversal of\n\na directed verdict, acquiring a judicial pronouncement that a\n\ndefendant has violated the Constitution unaccompanied by \"judicial\n\nrelief,\"     or   obtaining   a   non-judicial    \"alteration   of   actual\n\ncircumstances.\"     Id. at 605-06.\n\n             The Court emphasized three related factors.         The first\n\nwas that the change in legal relationship must be \"court-ordered.\"\n\nSee id. at 604.      Second, there must be judicial approval of the\n\nrelief vis-à-vis the merits of the case.

The order here lacked all of the core indicia of\n\na consent decree.     The court did not order USCIS to do anything.11\n\nThe   court   made   no   evaluation   at   all   of   the   merits   of   the\n\ncontroversy -- indeed the court was never asked to do so; it was\n\nonly asked to dismiss the case.        There was no basis on which the\n\ncourt could evaluate the merits because the USCIS never filed an\n\nanswer, never raised the potential defenses it had, and there never\n\nwas an engagement of any sort on the merits for the district court\n\nto consider.12 Further, the order itself did not contain provisions\n\n\n      11\n          We need not address what the proper vehicle would have\nbeen had the USCIS failed to carry through with its representation\nthat it would grant citizenship. But it is clear that the district\ncourt erred in concluding it could directly hold the USCIS in\ncontempt in such circumstances because the order did not issue a\nmandate to the USCIS.

A consent decree may itself contain mandatory language\nthat is directly enforceable by a contempt action.\n      12\n          This case is factually distinguishable from the Tenth\nCircuit's recent decision in Al-Maleki v.

There, the court upheld an\naward of fees under the EAJA where the district court, after the\ncase was filed, denied the government's initial motion for an\nunrestricted remand after a hearing, ordered the government to file\nan answer, accepted the representations in the answer, then granted\na joint motion to remand, and entered an order expressly directing\n\n                                   -17-\n\ffor future enforcement typical of consent decrees.           See Kokkonen,\n\n511 U.S. at 381; Saccoccia, 433 F.3d at 28.          The order also did not\n\nresolve   a    dispute   between   the    parties,    it   merely   returned\n\njurisdiction to the agency to allow the parties to carry out their\n\nagreement.13    Indeed, the order would not create prevailing party\n\n\nthe USCIS to administer the oath of citizenship to the applicant,\nAbbas Al-Maleki. The court found an order directing the agency to\nact was required because, as the court noted, \"at the time the\ndistrict court's order was entered, USCIS had not yet naturalized\nAl-Maleki or made a binding commitment to do so.\"      Id. at *3.\nHere, there were no such proceedings. No such order was entered;\nthe court only remanded to the agency for it to act on its promise\nto grant citizenship. Our pointing out these factual distinctions\nshould not be taken as agreement with the panel decision of the\nTenth Circuit on this or any other point.\n     13\n          The dissenters appear to characterize the district court\nas either having essentially issued an injunction requiring the\nagency to perform certain actions or as somehow having turned the\nremand into a consent decree. The dissenters' reading is not based\non the actual October 12, 2006 remand order, but on the district\ncourt's later characterization of the order.       The argument is\nflawed for a number of reasons. First, the district court itself\ndid not at any time characterize itself as having issued an\ninjunction or as having approved a consent decree which\nincorporated other terms into its order, and properly so.       The\nrequirements of Rule 65 were never met nor sought to be met nor was\nthis presented as a consent decree.\n          Second, the October 12, 2006 order on its face is merely\nan allowance of a motion to remand, it was not an injunction nor\ndid it incorporate anything else.     On its face, the order was\nunambiguous and lacked any provision mandating the USCIS to act or\nexpressly retaining jurisdiction to force the government to act.\nWhile the allowance of motions for remand after litigation may meet\nthe EAJA criteria for judicial imprimatur, this did not.\n          Third, while a district court's later characterization of\nwhat it had intended in an earlier order may at times be helpful,\nthis situation does not fall into any of the usual patterns. For\nexample, the district court was not involved in settlement\nnegotiations which enabled it to shed light on the nature of the\nsettlement. See F.A.C., Inc. v. Cooperativa de Seguros de Vida de\nP.R., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794465\"><a href=\"/opinion/794465/fac-inc-dba-financial-advisors-and-consultants-inc-fac-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 192 (1st Cir. 2006).

A plaintiff does not become a prevailing party if\n\nthe court merely recognizes what the government has voluntarily\n\n\n\nwhether statements from the bench were meant to be a judicial\norder.

Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 381; Saccoccia, 433\nF.3d at 28. In F.A.C., we held that a court's order must expressly\nretain jurisdiction or expressly incorporate the terms of a\nsettlement agreement to satisfy Kokkonen.

First, 8 U.S.C. § 1446(a) provides that\n\n\"[b]efore a person may be naturalized, an employee of [the USCIS]\n\n. . . shall conduct a personal investigation of the person applying\n\n\n\n     16\n           In May 2008, USCIS had approximately 270,000 name check\ncases pending for all categories of applicants, and over 80% of the\ncases had been pending for more than 90 days. In April 2008, USCIS\nand the FBI announced a joint plan to eliminate the backlog in name\ncheck searches by refining the search process and increasing the\namount of staff dedicated to conducting searches. See Citizenship\nand Immigration Services Ombudsman, Annual Report 2008, at 6-7,\navailable at http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/CISOMB_Annual_\nReport_2008.pdf.    The number of pending name checks dropped to\napproximately 95,000 by August 2008.

L. No. 105-119, 111 Stat. 2440, 2448-49\n\n(1997) [hereinafter 1997 Appropriations Act].   These are statutory\n\ncommands the agency could not ignore.\n\n          Aronov's argument is that the phrase \"confirmation from\n\nthe [FBI] that a full criminal background check has been completed\"\n\ndid not require the USCIS or the FBI to include an FBI name check\n\nin that process.   While it might have been reasonable, he argues,\n\nto require the FBI name check if it could have been completed\n\nwithin 120 days, it was not reasonable to do so if that name check\n\nrequirement virtually guaranteed that the application process would\n\ntake longer than 120 days to complete.\n\n          It is true that Congress did not define for the agency\n\nwhat a full criminal background check was.   Congress chose to let\n\nthe USCIS, with its particular expertise, decide the content of\n\nthat \"confirmation from the [FBI] [of] a full criminal background\n\ncheck.\"   1997 Appropriations Act, 111 Stat. at 2448-49.

The USCIS decided in 2002 that the inclusion of FBI\n\nname        checks       provided     better     full        criminal      background\n\ninvestigations.           It reached this conclusion after the terrorist\n\nattacks      of    September    11,   2001     and   after    it   discovered    that\n\ndeficiencies in its previous screening process had resulted in the\n\ngrant of naturalization to a man suspected of ties to the terrorist\n\ngroup Hezbollah.            See S.S. Hsu & N.C. Aizenman, FBI Name Check\n\nCited in Naturalization Delays, Wash.

See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 335.3(a) (\"A decision to grant or deny the application shall be\n\nmade at the time of the initial examination or within 120 days\n\nafter the date of the initial examination of the applicant . . .\n\n.\").   That regulation should, of course, be read in the context of\n\nthe regulations defining when an initial determination may take\n\nplace.       Aronov   was    mistakenly    given    a    premature     initial\n\nexamination.     See id. § 335.2(b).\n\n             Even were the agency's views wrong as to the requirement\n\nfor FBI name checks and as to whether the statute and/or regulation\n\nimposed a flat 120-day deadline, its views were still substantially\n\njustified.    Neither the Supreme Court nor this court has ever held\n\nthat   FBI   name   checks   are   not   required   as    part   of   full   FBI\n\nbackground checks or that § 1447 imposes an absolute time limit for\n\ngranting citizenship regardless of whether the name check is\n\ncompleted.     At most, then, this is a situation in which an agency\n\n\n                                    -28-\n\fhas imposed regulatory requirements on itself that are in tension,\n\nand the solution it chose, to bend the 120-day rule because the\n\nbackground check was not completed, is entirely reasonable.\n\n           Independently, the choice by USCIS to favor national\n\nsecurity   in   requiring   a    full   check   of    the    background   of   a\n\ncitizenship     applicant   over    a   self-imposed        120-day   deadline,\n\nregardless of whether the interview was prematurely granted here,\n\ncannot be unreasonable.        As the USCIS has stated:\n\n           Although [FBI name checks] may require a more\n           lengthy processing time, USCIS believes that\n           performing them is essential to identifying\n           national security and public safety concerns\n           that would not have been uncovered by other\n           means. This is particularly true given that\n           in[] a few cases, the information obtained\n           from the FBI through this process has\n           reflected very significant issues and risks.\n           FBI name checks disclose information to USCIS\n           that is otherwise not available. . . .

Bentley).\n\n               Aronov advances one more reason why, in his view, the\n\nagency had been unreasonable. He argues that the USCIS had created\n\na system for giving priority to certain applicants, under which the\n\nagency would request the application be expedited if, for example,\n\nthe applicant were facing military deployment. One of the official\n\nfactors is whether the applicant has filed an action for mandamus.19\n\nAronov       says    that   this   has   created   an   incentive    system   which\n\n\n       19\n          The criteria for expediting are: \"Military deployment\nmust be imminent,\" \"Age-out benefits,\" \"Writ of Mandamus,\"\n\"Immigration Judge cases -- grant of lawful permanent residence,\"\nand \"Compelling reasons as provided by the requesting office (i.e.,\ncritical medical condition) assessed on a case by case basis.\"\n\n                                          -30-\n\frequires candidates to sue to get priority in having FBI name\n\nchecks done, which unreasonably forces applicants to sue.          As the\n\nUSCIS points out, the logic of this argument is to impose EAJA fees\n\non it in the numerous instances it has benefitted an applicant by\n\ngiving priority to the applicant's name check.\n\n          The   reasoning   assumes    there   is   some   right   in   the\n\napplicant to priority, but there is no statutory right, given to\n\nAronov or anyone else, to jump the queue.      And the agency's choice\n\nto give priorities to the categories it selected was a rational\n\nallocation of resources,20 which must be spent on litigation if the\n\nagency does not work out a voluntary solution.21            For the same\n\n\n     20\n          Aronov and amicus argue that in an EAJA action, a court\ncan never consider the resources of the agency on the question of\nwhether the agency's actions were substantially justified. That is\nnot so. Aronov and amicus wrongly rely on the Court's statement in\nCommissioner, INS v.

This statement addresses only the\nargument, which the government does not make here, that the\nagency's need for resources should outweigh a successful\napplicant's right to an award.

In   other    words,   the     majority     adopts    the\n\ngovernment's position on imprimatur without deciding whether USCIS\n\nwas free to act without the district court's explicit approval of\n\nthe parties' proposed course of action.             The majority     concludes\n\nthat   even    assuming   the   district    court's   order    constituted     a\n\ntransfer of its exclusive jurisdiction back to USCIS, the district\n\ncourt's decision was not a consideration of the merits.

That the remand order\nin that case was slightly more detailed and that more litigation\nhad transpired before the remand order cannot be sufficient to\ndistinguish Al-Maleki. Id. at *3. These differences in formatting\nare not relevant to the effect and force of the remand order or to\nthe Tenth Circuit's conclusion that the government's catalyst\narguments were unconvincing. Id. Rather the functional posture of\nboth cases is the same: the district court agreed with the parties\njoint request for remand for the purpose of allowing the\nplaintiff's application.     Thus, the majority adoption of the\ngovernment's position that Al-Maleki is distinguishable is\nstrained, elevates form over function, and effectively does create\na circuit split.\n\n                                      -35-\n\fspecific   action.          This    extension        of    the   rule   that    formal\n\ninjunctions must not incorporate other documents by reference, see\n\nFed. R Civ. P. 65(d), seems to me to be both questionable and\n\ncumbersome.    Nonetheless, the majority unhesitatingly adopts it to\n\nsupport the government's position.\n\n           Finally, on the issue of substantial justification, the\n\nmajority   again     reaches       to   support      the   government's    position.\n\nThough the agency's own regulation spells out a clear rule --\n\ndecisions must be made within 120 days of the initial examination\n\n-- the majority calls the agency's violation of its own rule\n\nreasonable.     Specifically, to avoid granting Aronov relief, the\n\nmajority relies on the government's attenuated insinuations that\n\nour national security will be threatened by ruling against it. But\n\nAronov's modest request for attorney's fees does not seek to\n\nprevent the government from performing background checks.                       Rather\n\nhe seeks only to recover the costs he was forced to incur to obtain\n\nadjudication of his petition after an excessive delay attributable\n\nto   backlog   and   a   failure        to    follow   protocol.        Only   through\n\nacquiescence    to    the    government's           policy   suggestions       can   the\n\nmajority conclude that it would be unreasonable to expect USCIS to\n\nconduct the necessary background checks while complying with its\n\nown timing regulations.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -36-\n\f           With due respect, I suggest that our jurisprudence would\n\nbetter reflect the time-honored motto, \"Equal justice under law,\"4\n\nif we showed the same doctrinal flexibility and credulity to policy\n\narguments presented by citizens asking us to limit governmental\n\npower, or for compensation for harm caused by governmental error,\n\nas shown by the majority to the government in this appeal.               For\n\nthese    reasons,   and   the   reasons   stated   by   Judge   Lipez,     I\n\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n                     -Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n     4\n          As appears engraved on the building housing the Supreme\nCourt of the United States.\n\n                                   -37-\n\f              LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, with whom TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge,\n\njoins, dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the decision of the\n\nmajority      narrowing    the   class    of   plaintiffs     who   can   obtain\n\nattorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (\"EAJA\").\n\nWith its strangely dismissive view of a decision of the district\n\ncourt explaining why Aronov is a prevailing party, the majority\n\nrefuses to accord that status to an immigrant who, facing a\n\nsubstantial     delay     in   the   processing   of   his    application    for\n\nnaturalization, exercised his statutory right to sue the U.S.\n\nCitizenship and Immigration Service (\"USCIS\") and obtained an order\n\nfrom the district court remanding the matter to USCIS so that he\n\ncould be made a citizen.         Invoking national security concerns that\n\nare     not    implicated      here,     the   majority      characterizes    as\n\nsubstantially justified the conduct of USCIS, whose delay in\n\nprocessing the naturalization application was both contrary to\n\nstatute and to its own regulations.            These legal conclusions are\n\nunwarranted, unwise, and contrary to the purpose and promise of the\n\nEAJA.\n\n                                         I.\n\n              The facts of this case are straightforward.                 Aronov\n\napplied for naturalization with the Vermont Service Center of USCIS\n\non May 22, 2004.     On February 14, 2005, USCIS conducted an initial\n\nexamination of Aronov regarding his application. As the government\n\nacknowledges, the agency's interview with Aronov was premature.\n\n\n                                       -38-\n\fUSCIS's own regulation dictates that an initial examination should\n\nbe undertaken only after an applicant's full background check has\n\nbeen   completed.      8    C.F.R.    §   335.2(b).     After    Aronov   was\n\ninterviewed,    federal     law    required    USCIS   to   adjudicate    his\n\napplication within 120 days.          See 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b); 8 C.F.R. §\n\n335.3(a).    Aronov heard nothing from USCIS for over a year.             He\n\nmade repeated inquiries about the status of his application.               On\n\nMarch 23, 2006, 402 days after his examination, Aronov received a\n\nletter from the agency requesting six months more to complete\n\nadditional review.     At that time, Aronov's statutory right to sue\n\nUSCIS in federal district court to compel action on his application\n\nhad already accrued.       See 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b).     On August 28, 2006,\n\n560 days afer his initial examination, and 440 days past USCIS's\n\ndeadline for adjudicating the application, Aronov filed suit.\n\n            Thirty-nine     days     later,   the   background   check    was\n\ncomplete.    On October 6, 2006, the government and Aronov filed a\n\nJoint Motion for Remand Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b).            In full,\n\nthe joint motion read:\n\n            Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1447(b), the parties in\n            this action, plaintiff . . . and defendants\n            Michael Chertoff, Secretary of the United\n            States Department of Homeland Security, et\n            al., hereby jointly move this Honorable Court\n            to remand this matter to the USCIS, so that\n            [it] can grant plaintiff's application for\n            naturalization, and schedule plaintiff's oath\n            ceremony for no later than November 8, 2006.\n            In support of this motion, the parties state\n            as follows:\n\n\n                                      -39-\n\f                 1.

Since    that   date,   USCIS   has\n          completed    its    review    of    plaintiff's\n          application   for    naturalization   and,   if\n          jurisdiction is returned to the agency, would\n          grant the application and schedule plaintiff's\n          oath ceremony for no later than November 8,\n          2006.\n                 3.   The governing statute, 8 U.S.C. §\n          1447(b), provides that, in cases in which the\n          agency has failed to render a decision on an\n          application for naturalization within 120 days\n          of the examination of the applicant, the\n          applicant may file suit in district court\n          requesting to adjudicate the application and\n          \"[s]uch court has jurisdiction over the matter\n          and may either determine the matter or remand\n          the matter, with appropriate instructions, to\n          the Service to determine the matter.\"\n\n                 Wherefore, with good cause having been\n          shown, the parties respectfully request that\n          this Court remand this matter to USCIS so that\n          it can grant plaintiff's application for\n          naturalization and schedule plaintiff for an\n          oath ceremony for no later than November 8,\n          2006.\n\n          On October 12, 2006, the court entered an electronic\n\norder granting the motion and the remand.

According to the majority, \"three related\n\nfactors\"    must   characterize   an   order   that   is   the   functional\n\nequivalent of a consent decree.         First, there must be a \"court-\n\nordered\" change in the legal relationship resulting from the\n\nunderlying litigation. Second, \"there must be judicial approval of\n\nthe relief vis-a-vis the merits of the case.\"         Third, there must be\n\n\"judicial oversight and ability to enforce the obligations imposed\n\non the parties.\"      These factors must all be present if a court\n\norder is to constitute the functional equivalent of a consent\n\ndecree. According to the majority, none of the factors was present\n\nhere.\n\n            The majority is wrong.       All three factors were present\n\nhere.   The change in legal relationship between USCIS and Aronov\n\nwas court-ordered.       The court satisfied the requirements for\n\napproval of a consent decree, which do not require the court to\n\nstate explicitly that it has approved the relief in relation to the\n\nmerits of the case.

In its initial argument to us, the\ngovernment did not suggest that USCIS maintained jurisdiction over\nAronov's application after he filed suit in district court. In the\nen banc proceedings, the government alluded to the concurrent\njurisdiction argument. Whatever the government's intent with the\nallusion, it is beside the point. The government's conduct of the\nlitigation reflected its view that it could not act on Aronov's\nnaturalization application without a remand order from the district\ncourt. Moreover, as the Tenth Circuit recently pointed out in Al-\n\n                                     -45-\n\fthere had to be an intervening judicial order before Aronov could\n\nobtain     relief.     Nothing    about    this   order    was   automatic;   the\n\ndistrict     court    had   the   discretion      to   either     determine   the\n\nnaturalization issue itself or remand to USCIS with instructions.\n\n             This is not the catalyst scenario of Buckhannon.               There,\n\nthe plaintiff alleged that West Virginia law conflicted with\n\nfederal law, 532 U.S. at 601, and the West Virginia legislature\n\nretained      its     authority      throughout          the     litigation    to\n\n\"unilateral[ly]\" amend its laws. See Smyth, 282 F.3d at 278 (using\n\nthis expression).       It exercised that authority and rendered the\n\nsuit moot, after which the government moved to dismiss the case.\n\nHere USCIS could do no such thing.                It lacked the authority to\n\n\"unilaterally\"       provide   Aronov     the   relief    he   requested.     The\n\ndistrict court's order was necessary to return authority to the\n\nagency.4\n\n\nMaleki v.

This order of\nevents distinguishes Buckhannon regardless of the jurisdictional\nquestion.\n     4\n          Contrary to the majority's suggestion, the fact that\nUSCIS acted voluntarily in coming to an agreement with Aronov does\nnot make Aronov ineligible for fees.

However,\n\nwe expressly limited our rejection of the incorporation claim to\n\n\"the present case,\" noting, \"[h]ard and fast rules may be unwise\n\nbecause of variations in language and context.\"5                Id.\n\n\n     5\n          In F.A.C., we discussed the importance of context to the\nincorporation of a settlement agreement into a dismissal order.\nF.A.C., 449 F.3d at 190. Here we are dealing with a remand order.\nIf anything, the case for incorporating by reference the terms of\na preceding motion into a remand order is stronger than the case\n\n                                      -48-\n\f          This is a sensible approach.    District courts routinely\n\nenter orders granting a party's motion without elaboration.       The\n\nidea that such an order cannot incorporate by reference the terms\n\nof the motion to which the order responds is at odds with the daily\n\npractice of the courts. To be sure, incorporation by reference may\n\nbe inappropriate for the entry of a consent decree that addresses\n\na complex lawsuit with many issues and multiple parties.   But this\n\nis not remotely such a case.       The relief Aronov sought was\n\nstraightforward:     \"[a]djudicating     [his]    Application    for\n\nNaturalization . . . or, in the alternative, [r]equiring [USCIS] to\n\nadjudicate [his] application for naturalization.\" Only two parties\n\nwere involved.   The terms of their joint motion were clear.    There\n\nwas no impediment, legal or practical, to the incorporation of that\n\njoint motion into the district court's remand order.\n\n          One cannot examine the record below and conclude --\n\nagainst the district court's interpretation of its own remand order\n\n-- that the court did not refer to the joint motion with the intent\n\nof incorporating its terms, and with the full expectation that the\n\npromises made therein would be fulfilled.        The parties' joint\n\n\nfor incorporating by reference the terms of a settlement agreement\ninto a dismissal order.     Remand, unlike dismissal, expressly\ncontemplates an ongoing adjudication of a case by a lower court or\nadministrative agency, pursuant to the order of the remanding\ncourt. See Blacks Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004). Remanding courts\nintend, and the parties expect, the remand order to instruct the\nlower court or agency about what further proceedings should take\nplace, and orders often accomplish this by incorporation -- e.g.,\n\"We remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\"\n\n                               -49-\n\fmotion makes specific representations to the court about the action\n\nthe defendant would take.      The court's order refers to the joint\n\nmotion twice, once by name and once by docket number.           USCIS could\n\nonly understand that the court was ordering it to carry out the\n\npromise made to the court.            USCIS would naturalize Aronov by\n\nNovember 8, 2006, and thereby change his status from alien to\n\ncitizen.\n\n          2.

Again, the\n\ncontext is simple.       There is one plaintiff, one government agency,\n\nand a specific form of relief that is being sought.             The judge had\n\nthe benefit of both the complaint and the parties' joint motion for\n\nremand.   The complaint identified the factual and legal bases for\n\nproviding relief. The joint motion isolated the relevant facts and\n\nlaw, and asserted \"good cause\" for remanding to the agency for\n\nnaturalization.        From these documents, the district court could\n\n\n                                        -52-\n\freadily evaluate the merits of Aronov's claim in relation to the\n\nrelief described in the joint motion, and determine that the\n\njointly proposed agreement was \"fair, adequate, and reasonable.\"6\n\nThe court also could determine that it met the requirements imposed\n\nby Frew.    In short, the record contains adequate facts to support\n\nthe   court's     decision   to   approve   the   proposed    agreement     and\n\nincorporate it in an order of the court, and there is no reason to\n\nassume, as the majority apparently does, that the court failed to\n\nmake the necessary determination.\n\n            3.    The   court   retained    jurisdiction     to   enforce   the\nagreement\n\n            The majority argues that the district court's order \"did\n\nnot contain provisions for future enforcement typical of consent\n\ndecrees.\"        But a consent decree need not contain a separate\n\nprovision explicitly retaining jurisdiction for future enforcement.\n\nWe have held that if the terms of an agreement are incorporated\n\n\n\n      6\n          There is no legal support for the majority's contention\nthat a defendant must file an answer or \"raise defenses\" before a\nconsent decree (or its equivalent) may be entered by a federal\ncourt. Consent decrees may be entered at any stage of litigation,\nand are regularly entered before a defendant has filed an answer.\nSee Maimon Schwarzschild, Public Law by Private Bargain: Title VII\nConsent Decrees and the Fairness of Negotiated Institutional\nReform, 1984 Duke L.J. 887, 913 (noting that parties often\nnegotiate consent decrees before the complaint is filed, and that\nduring the period of study nearly one-third of Title VII consent\ndecrees involving the Department of Justice and public employers\nwere entered the day the complaint was filed).

The law does not require that the district court state\n\nexplicitly that it has evaluated the fairness, reasonableness, and\n\nadequacy of a proposed consent decree.             It is enough if the record\n\nwould permit the district court to make that evaluation.                     The\n\nrecord   in    this   simple   case   is   ample    for   that    purpose.     By\n\nincorporating the parties' joint motion, the remand order provided\n\n\nCiv.

The crucial question, as the majority\nacknowledges, is whether the district court retained jurisdiction\nover the agreement. The remand order did this by incorporating the\nterms of the joint motion by reference. Given this circumstance,\nif USCIS had failed to comply with the remand order, Aronov could\nhave asked the court to issue an injunction confirming the\nnaturalization obligation of USCIS and ordering compliance with it.\nCourts routinely issue supplemental orders to enforce a consent\ndecree as a prelude to the invocation of contempt authority. See,\ne.g., King v. Greenblatt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747151\"><a href=\"/opinion/747151/mitchell-g-king-v-milton-greenblatt-md-commission-of-the-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 192 n.5 (1st cir. 1997)\n(describing the district court's issuance of injunctions \"to\nimplement the thrust of the earlier consent decree\"). The majority\nfails to recognize the distinction between consent decrees and\ninjunctions. It suggests wrongly that I have characterized the\ndistrict court \"as having essentially issued an injunction.\" That\nis not so. I have concluded that the district court entered the\nfunctional equivalent of a consent decree.          There are key\ndifferences between consent decrees and injunctions -- the\nviability of incorporation by reference being a principal one. The\nmajority appears to believe that any order that does not meet the\nheightened standards applicable to injunctions and the contempt\nsanction \"does not order [the parties] to do anything\" and leaves\nthe issuing court powerless to enforce the order.           Such a\nconclusion belies the law and common sense.\n\n                                      -55-\n\fa continuing basis for enforcing the agreement if USCIS did not\n\ncomply with its representations to the court.            Thus, the court's\n\nremand order was the functional equivalent of a consent decree, and\n\nAronov was a prevailing party.9\n\nB. Substantial Justification\n\n            In addressing the \"substantial justification\" issue, the\n\nmajority announces a broad rule to protect USCIS's authority to\n\nmake policy choices favoring national security interests.              As I\n\nwill explain, no such authority is at issue.         The question is much\n\nnarrower:   whether   the   delay   in     this   case   was   substantially\n\njustified, in light of the fact that USCIS exceeded both the\n\nstatutory and regulatory deadlines governing the naturalization\n\nprocess.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n          The Tenth Circuit's recent decision in Al-Maleki, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">692612</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2-3, affirmed an award of attorney's fees under EAJA to\na naturalization applicant who had filed suit under section 1447(b)\nafter there was a substantial delay in the adjudication of his\napplication.   The court's prevailing party analysis is strongly\nsupportive of my analysis here. As I have already noted, supra\nnote 4, the court distinguished Buckhannon on the grounds that the\ndistrict court had resolved the litigation in favor of the\napplicant before USCIS naturalized him. Id. at *3. Moreover, the\napplicant, like Aronov, had submitted a joint motion with USCIS\nrepresenting to the court that USCIS would naturalize him by a\ncertain date. Id. The Tenth Circuit noted that the court's order\nwas \"bas[ed] . . . [on] the parties' stipulations\" in the joint\nmotion, and that the order was judicially enforceable against USCIS\nif the agency failed to comply. Id. Entry of such an order, the\nTenth Circuit said, \"not USCIS's stipulation, was the action which\nindelibly alter[ed] the legal landscape between USCIS and [the\napplicant].\" Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nThis order sufficed to make the applicant a prevailing party.\n\n                                    -56-\n\f           The government bears the burden of demonstrating that its\n\nposition was substantially justified.

The Supreme Court has interpreted the\n\n\"substantially    justified\"        language     in    the    EAJA    to    require\n\nreasonableness: \"[A]s between the two commonly used connotations of\n\nthe word 'substantially,' the one most naturally conveyed by the\n\nphrase before us here is not 'justified to a high degree,' but\n\nrather   'justified    in    substance     or    in   the    main'   --    that   is,\n\njustified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.\"\n\nPierce v.

The first statute, 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1446(a), provides that \"[b]efore a person may be naturalized, an\n\nemployee of the [USCIS], or of the United States designated by the\n\nAttorney General, shall conduct a personal investigation of the\n\nperson applying for naturalization.\"             The second mandate cited by\n\nthe majority, the 1998 Appropriations Act, states: \"During fiscal\n\n\n                                      -57-\n\fyear 1998 and each fiscal year thereafter, none of the funds\n\nappropriated or otherwise made available to [USCIS] shall be used\n\nto complete adjudication of an application for naturalization\n\nunless [USCIS] has received confirmation from the Federal Bureau of\n\nInvestigation that a full criminal background check has been\n\ncompleted . . . .\"        Depts. of Commerce, Justice & State, The\n\nJudiciary & Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1998, Pub.

The\n\nagency has concluded, it says, that the comprehensive FBI name\n\nchecks are \"essential\" to the background investigations.                 Although\n\na small percentage of name checks take a considerable amount of\n\ntime to complete, isolated delays should not prevent the government\n\nfrom maintaining the name check requirement as its policy.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -58-\n\f          This argument misconstrues what is at stake in this case.\n\nThere is no challenge to the authority of USCIS to adopt the name\n\ncheck program as a policy.   What is challenged is the application\n\nof that policy in this instance.      Even if USCIS is entitled to\n\ninvoke Chevron to defend its use generally of the FBI name check\n\nprocess, see generally Cass Sunstein, Chevron Step Zero, 92 Va. L.\n\nRev. 187 (2006) (analyzing the standards for determining whether an\n\nagency interpretation is entitled to evaluation under the Chevron\n\nframework), deference to the general policy does not imply that the\n\ngovernment was substantially justified in its dilatory handling of\n\nAronov's naturalization application.\n\n          The government's 440-day delay in acting on Aronov's\n\nnaturalization application exceeded the deadline imposed by section\n\n1447(b), which gives a district court jurisdiction to entertain a\n\nlawsuit by the applicant and evaluate a naturalization application\n\nif the agency has failed to adjudicate the application within 120\n\ndays after conducting its initial examination.

Although\n\nthe majority acknowledges that the agency has adopted a regulation,\n\n8 C.F.R. § 335.3(a), that treats the 120-day time frame as a\n\ndeadline, the majority regards the statutory and regulatory frame\n\nas merely aspirational, with no consequences for the agency if it\n\nfails to comply.10   If Congress had taken such a related view of its\n\n\n     10\n          The majority also contends that USCIS \"could reasonably\nbelieve it does not violate the statute by not acting within 120\ndays on the grounds that the statute does not command it to act\nwithin the deadline.\"    The agency's own regulations belie this\nclaim. As noted, part 335.3(a) expressly treats the 120-day time\nframe as a deadline.    Moreover, as a matter of policy, if the\nnaturalization applicant goes to the trouble of filing a lawsuit\nseeking mandamus on the basis that the 120-day deadline has\nexpired, the agency will capitulate and expedite the FBI name check\nrequest. According to a document entitled \"FBI Name Check Expedite\nCriteria,\" which Aronov attached to his Reply to the government's\nResponse to his Motion for attorney's fees, \"In order for USCIS to\nexpedite an FBI Name Check request, one of the following criteria\n\n                                 -60-\n\f120-day time frame, it would not have explicitly provided that an\n\napplicant whose naturalization application remains unresolved at\n\nthe end of the 120-day period may file suit in federal court to\n\nhave the application either adjudicated by the court or remanded to\n\nthe agency with instructions to adjudicate it.    See, e.g., Etape,\n\n497 F.3d at 384-85 (concluding that after an applicant has filed\n\nsuit with the district court pursuant to § 1447(b), the court has\n\nexclusive jurisdiction over the application).11\n\n\nmust be established: . . . Writ of Mandamus -- lawsuit pending in\nFederal Court.\" This policy is an unmistakable acknowledgment that\nthe petitioner invoking his or her statutory right to file suit\nunder section 1447(b) has a sound basis in law and fact for doing\nso.   It is therefore more accurate to say that the agency's\nwholesale disregard of the 120-day statutory and regulatory\ndeadline reflects its judgment that most naturalization applicants\nwhose applications are delayed beyond the 120-day statutory\ndeadline will not invoke their statutory right to sue.\n     11\n          In addition to section 1447(b)'s specific command, the\nAdministrative Procedures Act (\"APA\") offers a more general\ndirective to agencies to resolve matters presented to them within\na reasonable amount of time.

July 24, 1997) (\"[T]he\n120-day rule provides the court with a measure of what constitutes\na   reasonable   period   for   INS   to   process   naturalization\napplications.\").\n\n                               -61-\n\f            Moreover, the idea that the agency's early examination of\n\nAronov    was   some     sort   of   one-time   \"mistake,\"   as   the   majority\n\nsuggests, is belied by the briefs, which contain ample discussion\n\nof the \"flood\" of section 1447(b) lawsuits arising from delays in\n\nthe NNCP process.12        As they reveal, it was the agency's regular\n\npractice to violate its own regulations by examining candidates\n\nbefore receiving NNCP results, and then to compound that error by\n\nmissing the statutory and regulatory adjudication deadline, thereby\n\ngiving rise to a substantial number of lawsuits against the agency,\n\nat a cost both to taxpayers and applicants.                  USCIS engaged in\n\nprecisely that conduct in Aronov's case.               Yet, according to the\n\nmajority, this is a pre-litigation position \"justified to a degree\n\nthat could satisfy a reasonable person.\"                That is an indulgent\n\nreasonable      person    who   would   view    this   government   conduct   so\n\nbenignly.13\n\n            Finally, the majority imports national security concerns\n\ninto its defense of USCIS's handling of Aronov's application.                 It\n\nasserts sweepingly that \"the choice by USCIS to favor national\n\n\n     12\n          See Brief for American Immigration Lawyers Association,\nas Amicus Curiae in Support of Plaintiff, at 6-7.\n     13\n           I acknowledge the oddity that arises because of the\nagency's regulations. If USCIS had complied with its regulations\nand waited to interview Aronov until the FBI name check had been\ncompleted,   his   waiting  time  for   the  completion   of  the\nnaturalization process might have been longer than it was here.\nThis fact does not alter the legal analysis.     Once USCIS gave\nAronov his initial interview, it had to confront the clear timing\nobligation imposed by Congress.\n\n                                        -62-\n\fsecurity . . . regardless of whether the interview was prematurely\n\ngranted here, cannot be unreasonable.\"      There is no basis in\n\nfederal law for holding that an agency is substantially justified\n\nin ignoring its own regulations as long as it dutifully cites a\n\nnational security interest.\n\n          Moreover, the majority's invocation of these national\n\nsecurity interests reflects its continuing misapprehension of what\n\nthis case is about.   There is no challenge to the general validity\n\nof the name-check policy.     There is no suggestion that Aronov's\n\nnaturalization application should have been approved without the\n\nsecurity check that the agency deemed necessary.14     Once Aronov\n\n\n     14\n          In citing these national security interests, the majority\naccepts uncritically the relevance of the government's argument\nthat \"background checks are critical to insuring public safety and\nnational security.\" I do not dispute this proposition, which is\nirrelevant to the disposition of the case.       The majority also\naccepts uncritically the government's assertion that awarding\nAronov attorney's fees would \"create an enormous incentive for\nindividuals frustrated with delays in the naturalization process to\nfile mandamus lawsuits.\"     It is the agency itself that gives\napplicants an incentive to file suit by choosing to request\nexpedition of name checks if an applicant files suit. The agency\ncould remove this incentive by requesting expedition before a suit\nis filed, as the record shows it could. Finally, the majority also\nendorses the government's suggestion that awarding attorney's fees\nwill create a \"disincentive for the agency to settle these cases.\"\nYet   the   government   already  pursues   such   settlements   in\njurisdictions where it faces the risk of having to pay attorney's\nfees. See, e.g., Kats v. Frazier, No. Civ. 07-479, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2277598</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(D.

Wash. Feb 25, 2008); Berishev v. Chertoff, 486 F.\nSupp. 2d 202 (D. Mass. 2007). The agency's decision to seek an\nearly compromise despite facing a risk of paying attorney's fees is\neasy to understand. By refusing to settle the agency would risk\nthe payment of substantially higher EAJA fees because its\n\n                                -63-\n\ffiled a lawsuit, his application was approved promptly.         Indeed,\n\nthe agency adopted a policy of giving priority to naturalization\n\napplicants who filed lawsuits pursuant to section 1447(b).          If a\n\nnaturalization applicant went through the time, trouble and expense\n\nof filing a lawsuit against the government, the applicant was moved\n\nto the head of the line.    That policy might make sense to USCIS,\n\nbut it should not be cost-free in light of the additional expense\n\nit imposes on the applicant for naturalization.15\n\n            Although I do not foreclose the possibility that the\n\ngovernment could provide substantial justification grounded in the\n\nfacts of a particular case for not complying with the 120-day\n\nstatutory   requirement,   the   government   has   advanced   no   such\n\nparticularized justification here. Instead, the agency has offered\n\n\n\nunreasonable litigation position would compound the cost of its\nunreasonable pre-litigation position.\n     15\n          This is the same conclusion reached by the Tenth Circuit\nin Al-Maleki, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">692612</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6-7. There the court was faced\nwith the same relevant facts: USCIS had failed to meet its 120-day\ndeadline for adjudicating an application; the applicant inquired\nabout the delay, giving the agency notice of it; the source of the\ndelay was the name check; after the applicant filed suit, USCIS\nasked the FBI to expedite the name check and adjudication was soon\nthereafter complete.     As the court pointed out, these facts\nundermine the agency's contention that it is unable to process\napplications in a timely fashion because of the backlog in name\ncheck requests. Id. at *7. Rather, USCIS has simply elected to\nignore delayed applications until a lawsuit is filed. But USCIS's\nknowledge that its statutory deadline has passed and its capacity\nto address the problem by requesting expedition of the name check\nshould motivate the agency to act before a suit is filed.       Its\ndecision to expedite requests only if it is sued \"is not reasonable\nin fact.\" See id.\n\n                                 -64-\n\fonly general justifications for the delay, including the importance\n\nof the agency's policy of requiring name checks for security\n\npurposes and the significant backlog of names that the FBI is\n\nprocessing.     These explanations, however, do not justify the\n\nagency's disregard of the clear statutory mandate. Although I also\n\nacknowledge that the agency has valid -- indeed persuasive --\n\nreasons for requiring comprehensive FBI name checks under ordinary\n\ncircumstances, that policy determination cannot justify the failure\n\nto comply with a statutory deadline.            See, e.g., Rotinsulu v.\n\nMukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 72 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"An agency has an\n\nobligation to abide by its own regulations.\").\n\n           Despite the agency's plaint to the contrary, USCIS was\n\nnot   caught   in   a   hopeless   bind   between   the   national   security\n\nimperatives of name check review and the 120-day statutory and\n\nregulatory deadline.       As the facts in this case demonstrate, USCIS\n\ncould have addressed the name check delay in a manner consistent\n\nwith the applicable laws and regulations, and without sacrificing\n\nnational security interests, by doing generally and more promptly\n\nexactly what it did here.          Instead of waiting for a lawsuit, the\n\nagency could have bumped applicants \"mistakenly\" interviewed before\n\ntheir name checks were completed to the front of the name check\n\nline before the 120-day deadline lapsed, saving the applicants and\n\nthe agency the expense of a lawsuit.         At the very least, in those\n\ncases where the deadline has already passed and the applicant has\n\n\n                                     -65-\n\finformed the agency of this fact, USCIS could ask the FBI for\n\nexpedited treatment of the name check.16           What the agency surely\n\ncannot do with \"substantial justification\" is blatantly ignore the\n\nrequirements imposed on it by Congress and by itself.\n\n             The majority's attempt to invoke an administrative policy\n\nto trump an explicit statutory command turns Chevron deference on\n\nits head.     See Stinson v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112854\"><a href=\"/opinion/112854/stinson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 44 (1993)\n\n(\"Under Chevron, if a statute is unambiguous the statute governs .\n\n. . .\" (citations omitted)).        In light of the 120-day statutory\n\ndirective, the regulatory confirmation of that directive, the\n\nagency's long delay (nearly four times the statutory period in\n\nlength), and the absence of any evidence that the government tried\n\nto expedite Aronov's application to comply with the statute until\n\nhe   sued,   the   government's   conduct     toward   Aronov   can    only   be\n\nclassified as unreasonable and not substantially justified.                   See\n\nRussell v. Nat'l Mediation Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460185\"><a href=\"/opinion/460185/laurence-g-russell-william-l-hanna-and-eddie-d-langwell-v-national/\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1284</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1290 (5th Cir. 1985)\n\n(concluding that the government's position was not substantially\n\njustified     because   it   breached     a   clear    statutory      mandate).\n\nAccordingly, I would hold that the government was not substantially\n\njustified in its pre-litigation position.\n\n                                   III.\n\n             In order to defend the government's position and avoid\n\nthe simple truth of this case, the majority has burdened its\n\n\n      16\n             See supra notes 14, 15 and accompanying text.\n\n                                   -66-\n\fanalysis of the prevailing party issue with undue complexity, and\n\nits     analysis       of    the    substantial     justification      issue       with\n\nunwarranted national security concerns.                  After waiting through a\n\ndelay that violated statutory and regulatory deadlines by 440 days,\n\nAronov invoked his explicit statutory right to petition a district\n\ncourt to determine his naturalization application or order USCIS to\n\ndo so.    The lawsuit prompted the agency to complete the name check\n\nthat had apparently caused the delay within a few weeks of the\n\nfiling of the lawsuit.              With that process completed, the parties\n\nasked    the    court       to   remand     the   case   to   the   agency    so   the\n\nnaturalization process could be completed.                    Invoking the EAJA,\n\nAronov then successfully sought a modest award of $4,270.94 in\n\nattorney's fees from the district court for the time and trouble he\n\nincurred.           When the government appealed that award to us, a\n\nmajority of the panel ruled for Aronov.\n\n               But Aronov's time and trouble were far from over.               There\n\nwas the government's petition for en banc review, and now this.\n\nThe majority's fierce embrace of the government's opposition to\n\nthis modest award is out of all proportion to the stakes.                          Its\n\nrefusal to credit the district court's explanation of its remand\n\norder is unprecedented.                  Its invocation of national security\n\nconcerns       to    justify       the    government's    handling    of     Aronov's\n\napplication is unjustified.                We are left with a holding that is\n\n\n\n\n                                           -67-\n\fcontrary   to   the   purpose   and   the   promise   of   the   EAJA.   I\n\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -68-\n\f</pre>",
