All the parties were alleged to be citizens of Rhode Island. The object of the suit was to obtain an injunction against the defendants, forbidding them from carrying out the terms of a proposed plan of consolidation of Industrial Trust Company with The Providence Union National Bank, on the allegation that \"the said consolidation attempted with the consent of less than a unanimous vote of the stockholders of said corporation would be <i>ultra vires</i> the said corporation, illegal, and in violation of the rights of the stockholders dissenting thereto.\" The United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island denied a motion by plaintiff to remand the case to the state court and, after hearing and adjudication on the merits, entered judgment on December 30, 1953, dismissing the amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from this judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No stay or supersedeas having been sought or granted, appellees proceeded to complete the consolidation in accordance with the plan.

At the oral argument on the motion to dismiss, appellees conceded that if they succeeded in obtaining dismissal of the appeal as moot, they would not be entitled to retain the benefit of the judgment appealed from as being <i>res judicata</i> on the issue of the validity of the consolidation.
