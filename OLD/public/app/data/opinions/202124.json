Jay A. Garcia-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Raymond Rivera Esteves on Anders brief.\n     Lisandy Montero-Diaz on brief pro se.\n\n\n\n                             April 3, 2006\n\f            Per Curiam. Appellant Lisandy Montero-Diaz, a citizen of\n\nthe Dominican Republic, pled guilty (without a plea agreement) to\n\none count of re-entering the United States after removal subsequent\n\nto the commission of an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C.\n\nยง 1326(a)(2) and (b)(2).              Because he was sentenced after the\n\nSupreme Court's decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220\n\n(2005),    the     sentencing       guidelines   were   advisory   rather     than\n\nmandatory.        In calculating the guidelines range, the sentencing\n\ncourt applied a 16-level increase to the base offense level,\n\npursuant     to    U.S.S.G.     ยง    2L1.2(b)(1)(A),     and   arrived   at    an\n\nimprisonment range of 57 to 71 months. Defense counsel requested a\n\nsentence below that range, based on the defendant's personal\n\ncircumstances.        The court, treating the guidelines as purely\n\nadvisory, imposed a sentence of 57 months, for which it gave a\n\n\"reasoned explanation.\"         United States v. Jimenez-Beltre, __ F.3d\n\n__, 2006 WL 562154 (1st Cir., March 9, 2006).\n\n            Counsel for defendant has filed a motion to withdraw and\n\na brief pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967).\n\nAppellant has filed a supplemental pro se brief.               For the reasons\n\nstated below, and after a full examination of the record, we\n\nconclude that this appeal presents no meritorious issues.\n\n            I. Issues Raised in Anders Brief\n\n            The Anders brief addressed appellant's argument that the\n\ndistrict court erred in applying a 16-level enhancement in its\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fguidelines calculation where the sentence served was allegedly less\n\nthan thirteen months.    We agree with the conclusion in the Anders\n\nbrief that this issue is without merit. The argument is foreclosed\n\nby this court's decision in United States v. Carrasco-Mateo, 389\n\nF.3d 239 (1st Cir. 2004), cert. denied, __ U.S. __, 125 S. Ct. 1721\n\n(2005).   The Anders brief also correctly states that there is no\n\nBooker error where the court, treating the guidelines as advisory,\n\nbases   enhancements   upon   factual   findings   not   charged   in   the\n\nindictment and proven beyond a reasonable doubt, or admitted by the\n\ndefendant.   See United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           II. Issues Raised in Pro Se Brief\n\n           A. Ex Post Facto Clause\n\n           Montero-Diaz argues that the effect of the Court's Booker\n\ndecision, which changed the sentencing guidelines from a mandatory\n\nto an advisory system, offends the Constitution's ex post facto\n\nclause.   The ex post facto clause prohibits a legislative increase\n\nin punishment after the event.    See United States v. Lata, 415 F.3d\n\n107 (1st Cir. 2005).   In this case, however, Montero-Diaz' sentence\n\ndid not exceed the guideline maximum (71 months).         Moreover, this\n\ncourt has held that the ex post facto clause \"does not apply of its\n\nown force to changes worked by judicial decisions.\"          Id. at 110.\n\nAnd the sentence, at the bottom of the applicable guideline range,\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fdoes not raise any fair warning concerns under the due process\n\nclause.   See id. at 112.\n\n            B. Nondelegation Doctrine\n\n            Appellant    argues       that     the    Sentencing    Commission's\n\npromulgation    of   U.S.S.G.     ยง    2L1.2    violates     the   nondelegation\n\ndoctrine barring Congress from delegating its legislative power to\n\nanother   branch.       The   Supreme    Court       has   held,   however,   that\n\n\"Congress' delegation of authority to the Sentencing Commission [to\n\npromulgate sentencing guidelines] is sufficiently specific and\n\ndetailed to meet constitutional requirements.\" Mistretta v. United\n\nStates, 488 U.S. 361, 374 (1989).\n\n            To the extent that appellant is arguing that, in light of\n\nthe Apprendi, Blakely and Booker line of cases, Mistretta's holding\n\nno longer has force, the Supreme Court has rejected such an\n\nargument:\n\n\n            [T]he Commission's authority to identify the\n            facts relevant to sentencing decisions and to\n            determine the impact of such facts on federal\n            sentences is precisely the same whether one\n            labels such facts \"sentencing factors\" or\n            \"elements\" of crimes.       Our decision in\n            Mistretta, 488 U.S., at 371, upholding the\n            validity of the delegation of that authority,\n            is unaffected by the characterization of such\n            facts, or by the procedures used to find such\n            facts in particular sentencing proceedings.\n\nBooker, 543 U.S. at 242.       The Court has stated that its holding in\n\nBooker \"does not call into question any aspect of our decision in\n\nMistretta.\" Booker, 543 U.S. at 242.\n\n                                       -4-\n\f              C. Double Jeopardy Clause\n\n              Appellant argues that the sentencing court's application\n\nof ยง 2L1.2(b) violated the double jeopardy clause because it\n\nimposed an additional punishment for the prior state conviction for\n\nwhich he was previously sentenced.                Such challenges to enhanced\n\nsentences based on prior offenses have been rejected by the Supreme\n\nCourt:\n\n              In   repeatedly  upholding   such  recidivism\n              statutes, we have rejected double jeopardy\n              challenges because the enhanced punishment\n              imposed for the later offense \"is not to be\n              viewed as either a new jeopardy or additional\n              penalty for the earlier crimes,\" but instead\n              as \"a stiffened penalty for the latest crime,\n              which is considered to be an aggravated\n              offense because a repetitive one.\"\n\nWitte    v.   United    States,    515     U.S.   389,       400   (1995)(citations\n\nomitted).\n\n              Appellant argues that the Apprendi, Blakely, Booker line\n\nof cases calls into question this reasoning because \"[t]he prior\n\nconvictions     are    now    recognized    to    be   a   full    element   of   the\n\naggravated      illegal      reentry   offense.\"       Pro    Se   Brief,    p.   32.\n\nAppellant's argument has no merit because it is based on an\n\nerroneous premise that prior convictions are now to be treated as\n\nelements of the offense:\n\n              Apprendi's explicit exemption of sentence\n              enhancements    based   on    prior   criminal\n              convictions    from   the    scope   of    its\n              constitutional holding left intact the Supreme\n              Court's earlier decision in Almendarez-Torres\n              v. United States, 523 U.S. 224 (1998). There,\n\n                                         -5-\n\f          the Court endorsed treating prior convictions\n          as sentencing factors rather than elements of\n          federal criminal offenses. See Almendarez-\n          Torres, 523 U.S. at 226-27.     \"We have ruled\n          with a regularity bordering on the monotonous\n          that, given the explicit exception and force\n          of   Almendarez-Torres,   the    rationale    of\n          Apprendi   does   not   apply    to    sentence-\n          enhancement   provisions   based    upon   prior\n          criminal convictions.\" United States v. Moore,\n          286 F.3d 47, 51 (1st Cir. 2002). Nothing in\n          Blakely or Booker alters the continuing\n          vitality of the Almendarez-Torres exception to\n          Apprendi.\n\nUnited States v. Ivery, 427 F.3d 69, 74-75 (1st Cir. 2005)(emphasis\n\nadded), cert. denied, __ S. Ct. __, 2006 WL 236293 (Feb. 27, 2006);\n\nsee also Jimenez-Beltre, supra, at * 5 (noting that court is bound\n\nto follow Almendarez-Torres until it is expressly overruled).\n\n          D. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n          Appellant argues that counsel was ineffective in failing\n\nto argue to the sentencing judge that a downward departure from the\n\nguidelines range was warranted to avoid sentencing disparities and\n\nequal protection concerns resulting from the absence of a \"fast\n\ntrack\" system for prosecuting and sentencing illegally re-entering\n\naliens in Puerto Rico.    This court has rejected equal protection\n\nchallenges to the fast track program on the ground that similarly\n\nsituated defendants in fast track jurisdictions could receive a\n\nfour-level departure not available to defendants in non-fast track\n\njurisdictions. See United States v. Melendez-Torres, 420 F.3d 45,\n\n52-53 (1st Cir. 2005).   This court has also stated, in dicta, that\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f               [i]t is arguable that even post-Booker, it\n               would never be reasonable to depart downward\n               based on disparities between fast-track and\n               non-fast-track jurisdictions given Congress'\n               clear (if implied) statement in the PROTECT\n               Act provision that such disparities are\n               acceptable.\n\nUnited States v. Martinez-Flores, 428 F.3d 22, 30 n. 3 (1st Cir.\n\n2005), cert. denied, __ S. Ct. __, 2006 WL 236308 (Feb. 27, 2006);\n\nSee also Jimenez-Beltre, supra, (noting that [w]hether it would\n\neven be permissible to give a lower sentence on the ground [of\n\n\"fast track\" disparities] is itself an open question\").\n\n               Defense counsel argued at sentencing for a departure\n\nbelow    the    advisory     guideline       range,   on    the   basis   of   various\n\npersonal circumstances of the defendant, including no history of\n\nviolent offenses, and the fact that his last conviction was over\n\nten years' old.         In light of our precedents quoted above, the\n\nargument that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to also\n\nrequest a downward departure on \"fast track\" grounds is without\n\nmerit.\n\n               III. Other Potential Issues\n\n               Post-Booker,      this        court    reviews        sentences    for\n\nreasonableness. \"Under the post-Booker approach, 'district courts,\n\nwhile    not    bound   to   apply     the    Guidelines,     must    consult    those\n\nGuidelines and take them into account when sentencing,' subject to\n\nreview    by     the    courts    of     appeals      for    'unreasonableness.'\"\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 76 (quoting Booker, supra). Our recent\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fdecision,    Jimenez-Beltre,   supra,   provides   guidance   for   the\n\ndetermination and review of post-Booker sentences. Id. at * 1.       A\n\nreview of the record in this case, and particularly the sentencing\n\ntranscript, reveals that the district court's sentencing of the\n\nappellant was consistent with the approach we approved in Jimenez-\n\nBeltre.     The court first calculated the applicable guidelines\n\nrange.    In doing so, the court stated several times that \"its\n\nreference to the Guidelines is on a purely advisory basis.\"\n\n            In addition to consulting the guidelines on an advisory\n\nbasis, the sentencing court also took into account the reasons\n\ncited by defendant for imposing a sentence below the guidelines\n\nrange, and \"all those factors that are found in 18 U.S.C. ยง\n\n3553(a).\"   The court gave a \"reasoned explanation\" why the factors\n\ncited by defendant did not warrant a sentence below the guidelines\n\nrange. Id. at * 3. Specifically, the court relied upon defendant's\n\nrecord of prior convictions and his repeated illegal re-entries\n\ninto the country, and the need to promote respect for the law and\n\nto avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.       On this record, an\n\nargument that the district court acted unreasonably in declining to\n\nimpose a sentence below the guidelines range would be without\n\nmerit.\n\n            Counsel's motion to withdraw is granted, and appellant's\n\nconviction and sentence are affirmed.     See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",

The   Supreme    Court       has   held,   however,   that\n\n\"Congress' delegation of authority to the Sentencing Commission [to\n\npromulgate sentencing guidelines] is sufficiently specific and\n\ndetailed to meet constitutional requirements.\" Mistretta v.

Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n          Appellant argues that counsel was ineffective in failing\n\nto argue to the sentencing judge that a downward departure from the\n\nguidelines range was warranted to avoid sentencing disparities and\n\nequal protection concerns resulting from the absence of a \"fast\n\ntrack\" system for prosecuting and sentencing illegally re-entering\n\naliens in Puerto Rico.    This court has rejected equal protection\n\nchallenges to the fast track program on the ground that similarly\n\nsituated defendants in fast track jurisdictions could receive a\n\nfour-level departure not available to defendants in non-fast track\n\njurisdictions.

Other Potential Issues\n\n               Post-Booker,      this        court    reviews        sentences    for\n\nreasonableness. \"Under the post-Booker approach, 'district courts,\n\nwhile    not    bound   to   apply     the    Guidelines,     must    consult    those\n\nGuidelines and take them into account when sentencing,' subject to\n\nreview    by     the    courts    of     appeals      for    'unreasonableness.'\"\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 76 (quoting Booker, supra).

Id. at * 1.       A\n\nreview of the record in this case, and particularly the sentencing\n\ntranscript, reveals that the district court's sentencing of the\n\nappellant was consistent with the approach we approved in Jimenez-\n\nBeltre.     The court first calculated the applicable guidelines\n\nrange.    In doing so, the court stated several times that \"its\n\nreference to the Guidelines is on a purely advisory basis.\"\n\n            In addition to consulting the guidelines on an advisory\n\nbasis, the sentencing court also took into account the reasons\n\ncited by defendant for imposing a sentence below the guidelines\n\nrange, and \"all those factors that are found in 18 U.S.C. ยง\n\n3553(a).\"   The court gave a \"reasoned explanation\" why the factors\n\ncited by defendant did not warrant a sentence below the guidelines\n\nrange. Id. at * 3. Specifically, the court relied upon defendant's\n\nrecord of prior convictions and his repeated illegal re-entries\n\ninto the country, and the need to promote respect for the law and\n\nto avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.       On this record, an\n\nargument that the district court acted unreasonably in declining to\n\nimpose a sentence below the guidelines range would be without\n\nmerit.\n\n            Counsel's motion to withdraw is granted, and appellant's\n\nconviction and sentence are affirmed.
