Anilda and Vangel\n\nGjiknuri,1 citizens of Albania, petition for review of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals’ (BIA) affirmance of an Immigration Judge’s\n\n(IJ’s) denial of their applications for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).\n\nThe Gjiknuris’ petition is foreclosed by Circuit precedent:                  Tota\n\nv. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 161 (1st Cir. 2006), and Alibeaj v. Gonzales,\n\n469 F.3d 188 (1st Cir. 2006); both uphold BIA determinations based\n\non country condition reports that persons of petitioners’ political\n\npersuasion are not subject to persecution in Albania. We therefore\n\naffirm.\n\n               Anilda and Vangel Gjiknuri came to the United States in\n\nJuly 2001.       In March 2002, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService      issued    Notices    to   Appear    charging    them   with    being\n\nremovable. They conceded removability and applied for relief based\n\non   their    alleged     political    persecution    in    Albania.       The   IJ\n\ndisbelieved the Gjiknuris’ story and denied relief.                 The BIA, in\n\neffect, assumed without deciding that the petitioners had suffered\n\npersecution.          However, relying on the State Department’s 2004\n\ncountry report, Albania:           Profile of Asylum Claims and Country\n\nConditions (the \"Report\"), the BIA concluded that persons of\n\npetitioners’      political      persuasion     are   no   longer   subject      to\n\n\n\n      1\n      The Gjiknuris’ application for asylum renders their minor\nchildren Mirjan and Julia derivative applicants.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fpersecution in Albania and, on that ground, affirmed the IJ’s\n\ndenial of their asylum claim.\n\n          According to the Gjiknuris, in December 1990, they joined\n\nthe Democratic Party of Albania.      In February 1992, an Albanian\n\npolice officer struck Anilda on the face with the butt of his gun\n\nwhile she participated in a demonstration against the Socialist\n\nParty government.   Four days later, the Gjiknuris’ apartment was\n\nbombed.   Because they feared they had been targeted for abuse by\n\nthe Socialist Party, they fled to Greece.   They spent the next nine\n\nyears there, except for a few brief periods following expulsions\n\nfrom Greece to Albania.\n\n          They also claimed that while Vangel was briefly in\n\nAlbania in October 1998, three armed men, including a man known to\n\nhim to be a member of the Socialist Party, accosted him and told\n\nhim to leave Albania within twenty-four hours.    They further claim\n\nthat, during another such period in June 2001, they participated in\n\na Democratic Party demonstration in Albania; several days later,\n\nfive men arrested them and told them to stop their political\n\nactivities, referring to the 1992 bombing incident and warning that\n\n“the same thing could happen again.”    They detained Vangel for two\n\ndays, during which they beat, threatened, and insulted him.\n\n          Following this last incident, the Gjiknuris fled back to\n\nGreece and decided to leave Greece permanently.    Vangel and their\n\ntwo children entered the United States after obtaining tourist\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fvisas at the American embassy in Athens, Greece.               Anilda used a\n\nfalse passport to enter Canada; from there she sneaked across the\n\nborder into the United States.           Reunited, they filed the pending\n\napplication.\n\n           After     an    evidentiary   hearing,   an   IJ   held   that    the\n\nGjiknuris failed to carry their burden of proving a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution in the event of their removal to Albania.                The\n\nIJ found that there was insufficient evidence connecting the\n\nbombing   to   the   Gjiknuris’     political   opinions.      He    found   the\n\nGjiknuris’ accounts of the other incidents of alleged persecution\n\nincredible.\n\n           The BIA denied their appeal, holding that even if they\n\nhad proven past persecution, circumstances in Albania have changed\n\nfundamentally such that they no longer have a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution there. The BIA relied heavily upon the Report that, in\n\npart, noted that:         (1)   Albanian citizens exercise their right to\n\nchange the government peacefully through periodic elections; (2)\n\nthe Democratic Party participates in the political system and holds\n\nseats in Parliament; (3) officials have not arbitrarily withheld\n\npermits for gatherings in public places; and (4) there were a few\n\ninstances of police maltreatment of political protestors, but no\n\nconfirmed cases of politically-motivated detention or reports of\n\npolitical prisoners.         The BIA took administrative notice that the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fincumbent Prime Minister of Albania is a member of the Democratic\n\nParty.\n\n              On their appeal here, the Gjiknuris contend that the BIA\n\nviolated their right to due process by failing to “address any\n\nissue which had been raised at trial” and by basing the entirety of\n\nits decision on the changed political circumstances in Albania\n\nnoted    by   the     State   Department,         a   fact     “neither   raised   nor\n\nadjudicated below.”           Petitioners’ Opening Brief at 23.                    This\n\ncontention      is    without     merit     because      the    Gjiknuris   had    the\n\nopportunity      to    move     to   have    the      BIA    reconsider   or   reopen\n\nproceedings after the BIA affirmed the IJ’s decision. See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.2 (setting forth the procedures for making and adjudicating\n\nmotions to reopen and reconsider Board decisions).                   Nothing in the\n\nrecord indicates that the Gjiknuris made such a motion.\n\n              Because the Gjiknuris had the opportunity to be heard,\n\nthey received all the process they are due.                      In Gebremichael v.\n\nINS, we held that “the motion to reopen process can ordinarily\n\nsatisfy the demands of due process” when the BIA takes official\n\nnotice of extra-record facts concerning a change in government. 10\n\nF.3d 28, 38 (1st Cir. 1993); see also Bollanos v. Gonzales, 461\n\nF.3d 82 (1st Cir. 2006) (affirming a BIA holding that conditions in\n\nAlbania had fundamentally changed where the IJ had not addressed\n\nthat issue).\n\n\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\f              Looking beyond the due process technicality, we are\n\nsatisfied with the merits of the IJ/BIA denial of petitioners’\n\nasylum claim.      In order to qualify for asylum, the Gjiknuris must\n\nshow that they are outside their home country and “unable or\n\nunwilling to return . . . because of persecution or a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” 8\n\nU.S.C.    §    1101(a)(42)(A),     1158(b)(1)(A),      (B)(i);       8   C.F.R.    §\n\n208.13(a).      Proof of past persecution creates a presumption that\n\nthe   persecutee    has     such   a   well-founded    fear.         8    C.F.R.   §\n\n208.13(b)(1).      However, this presumption can be rebutted by a\n\npreponderance of evidence that “[t]here has been a fundamental\n\nchange in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution.”           8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A).\n\n              “Whether circumstances have fundamentally changed is a\n\nfactual question that we review under the deferential substantial\n\nevidence standard.”         Bollanos, 461 F.3d at 85.           “Thus, we must\n\naccept    the    agency's     determinations      ‘unless      any       reasonable\n\nadjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.’”                     Id.\n\n(quoting 8 U.S.C. §       1252(b)(4)(B)).\n\n              “State Department reports are generally probative of\n\ncountry conditions.” Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales, 428 F.3d 30, 36\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).          Although “abstract evidence of generalized\n\nchanges   in    country   conditions,     without     more,    cannot      rebut    a\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fpresumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution,” a State\n\nDepartment Country Conditions Report “may be sufficient, in and of\n\nitself,” if it “convincingly demonstrates material changes in\n\ncountry conditions that affect the specific circumstances of an\n\nasylum seeker's claim.”   Id. at 35-36 (emphasis added).\n\n          We have recently upheld several agency determinations\n\nthat fundamental changes to conditions in Albania rebutted the\n\npresumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution arising\n\nfrom allegations of past persecution based on support for the\n\nDemocratic   Party.   See,   e.g.,    Alibeaj,   469   F.3d   at   192-\n\n93,(affirming an agency finding that conditions in Albania have\n\nfundamentally changed as evidenced by the State Department's 2003\n\nreport, Albania: Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions);\n\nTota, 457 F.3d at 167 (holding that a State Department report was\n\nsufficient “in and of itself” to rebut the petitioner’s presumptive\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution in Albania based on the\n\npetitioner’s membership in the Democratic Party).\n\n          Petitioner has presented us with no reason to deviate\n\nfrom our holdings in Tota and Alibeaj.      Because the Gjiknuris’\n\nasylum claim fails, their application for withholding of removal\n\nnecessarily fails as well.   See Mediouni v. INS, 314 F.3d 24, 27\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          The Gjiknuris contend that we should reverse the BIA’s\n\ndismissal of their claim for relief under the CAT because the BIA\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fdid   not   explain   its   conclusion.   Although   the   BIA   did   not\n\nexplicitly connect its analysis of fundamentally changed conditions\n\nto whether the Gjiknuris will more likely than not face torture if\n\nreturned to Albania, its analysis applies equally to the likelihood\n\nof future torture as it does to future persecution.\n\n            Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f",

In order to qualify for asylum, the Gjiknuris must\n\nshow that they are outside their home country and “unable or\n\nunwilling to return . . . because of persecution or a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” 8\n\nU.S.C.    §    1101(a)(42)(A),     1158(b)(1)(A),      (B)(i);       8   C.F.R.    §\n\n208.13(a).      Proof of past persecution creates a presumption that\n\nthe   persecutee    has     such   a   well-founded    fear.         8    C.F.R.   §\n\n208.13(b)(1).      However, this presumption can be rebutted by a\n\npreponderance of evidence that “[t]here has been a fundamental\n\nchange in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution.”           8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A).\n\n              “Whether circumstances have fundamentally changed is a\n\nfactual question that we review under the deferential substantial\n\nevidence standard.”         Bollanos, 461 F.3d at 85.           “Thus, we must\n\naccept    the    agency's     determinations      ‘unless      any       reasonable\n\nadjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.’”                     Id.\n\n(quoting 8 U.S.C. §       1252(b)(4)(B)).\n\n              “State Department reports are generally probative of\n\ncountry conditions.” Palma-Mazariegos v.

Although “abstract evidence of generalized\n\nchanges   in    country   conditions,     without     more,    cannot      rebut    a\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fpresumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution,” a State\n\nDepartment Country Conditions Report “may be sufficient, in and of\n\nitself,” if it “convincingly demonstrates material changes in\n\ncountry conditions that affect the specific circumstances of an\n\nasylum seeker's claim.”   Id. at 35-36 (emphasis added).\n\n          We have recently upheld several agency determinations\n\nthat fundamental changes to conditions in Albania rebutted the\n\npresumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution arising\n\nfrom allegations of past persecution based on support for the\n\nDemocratic   Party.   See,   e.g.,    Alibeaj,   469   F.3d   at   192-\n\n93,(affirming an agency finding that conditions in Albania have\n\nfundamentally changed as evidenced by the State Department's 2003\n\nreport, Albania: Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions);\n\nTota, 457 F.3d at 167 (holding that a State Department report was\n\nsufficient “in and of itself” to rebut the petitioner’s presumptive\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution in Albania based on the\n\npetitioner’s membership in the Democratic Party).\n\n          Petitioner has presented us with no reason to deviate\n\nfrom our holdings in Tota and Alibeaj.      Because the Gjiknuris’\n\nasylum claim fails, their application for withholding of removal\n\nnecessarily fails as well.   See Mediouni v.

Although   the   BIA   did   not\n\nexplicitly connect its analysis of fundamentally changed conditions\n\nto whether the Gjiknuris will more likely than not face torture if\n\nreturned to Albania, its analysis applies equally to the likelihood\n\nof future torture as it does to future persecution.\n\n            Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f</pre>",
