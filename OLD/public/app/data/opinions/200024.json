This       tax   case   requires\n\ninterpretation of the Internal Revenue Code's Puerto Rico and\n\nPossession Tax Credit provision, 26 U.S.C. § 936 (2000), which\n\npermits a domestic corporation to elect a possession tax credit if\n\nit meets certain conditions, id. § 936(a).                  The condition on which\n\nthis case turns is that 75% or more of the gross income of the\n\ncorporation for the three preceding years must be \"derived from the\n\nactive conduct of a trade or business within a possession of the\n\nUnited States.\"           Id. § 936(a)(2)(B).1\n\n                The taxpayer, MedChem (P.R.), Inc. (\"M-PR\"), contends\nthat       it   meets    this   \"active    conduct   of     a   trade   or   business\"\n\nrequirement; the Tax Court and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue\ndisagree.        This issue appears to be one of first impression at the\ncircuit level.\n\n                The particular tax credit codified at § 936 was added by\nthe Tax Reform Act of 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-455, 90 Stat. 1520\n(1976) (codified in scattered sections of 26 U.S.C.), although it\n\nhas its roots in legislation from the 1920s, see Revenue Act of\n\n1921, Pub. L. No. 67-98, § 262, 42 Stat. 227, 271 (1921).                          The\ngovernment tells us that the tax credit is in the process of being\n\nphased out.             See 26 U.S.C. § 936(j).           This case has, in the\ninterim,        consequences      for     domestic   corporations       involved   in\n\n\n       1\n          Section 936(a)(2)'s other condition is that at least 80%\nof the corporation's gross income for the three-year period\nimmediately preceding the close of the tax year must be \"derived\nfrom sources within a possession of the United States.\" 26 U.S.C.\n§ 936(a)(2)(A). The parties agree that MedChem (P.R.) meets this\nrequirement.\n\n                                            -2-\n\fbusiness activity in Puerto Rico2 and certain other possessions.\nUnfortunately, there are no promulgated regulations under § 936(a)\n\nand   domestic     corporations    have      been   forced    to     make   business\narrangements in U.S. possessions without the prior guidance such\n\nregulations might provide.\n\n               Based primarily on § 936's text, understood in the\ncontext of the legislative history, we conclude that M-PR has\n\nfailed    to    meet   the   \"active   conduct      of   a   trade    or    business\"\n\nrequirement and, accordingly, we affirm the Tax Court's judgment.\n\nWe do so without adopting the Tax Court's proposed test for what\n\nconstitutes the active conduct of a trade or business in a U.S.\n\npossession for purposes of § 936(a).\n\n                                        I.\n\n               The facts in this case are not in dispute, MedChem\n\n(P.R.), Inc. v. Comm'r, 116 T.C. 308, 310 (2001); see generally Tax\nCt. R. 122, although M-PR contests the inferences the Tax Court\ndrew from the stipulated record.          M-PR is the taxpayer claiming to\n\nqualify for the possessions tax credit.\n               M-PR's identity has gone through several transformations.\nM-PR was incorporated in Delaware on December 8, 1987, as MedChem\n\nPuerto Rico, Inc.       A couple of weeks later, on December 22, MedChem\nPuerto Rico, Inc. changed its name to BioChem Products, Inc. Then,\non March 1, 1992, BioChem Products, Inc. changed its state of\n\n\n      2\n          Puerto Rico is a Commonwealth; it is explicitly within\nthe term \"possession\" for purposes of § 936. 26 U.S.C. § 936(d)(1)\n(\"The term 'possession of the United States' includes the\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico . . . .\").\n\n                                       -3-\n\fincorporation to Massachusetts and, on November 25, 1992, changed\n\nits name to MedChem P.R., Inc.   M-PR and all of its predecessors --\n\nall of which we will refer to as M-PR -- were at all times wholly\nowned subsidiaries of MedChem Products, Inc. (\"M-USA\").           M-USA is\n\na Massachusetts corporation with its principal place of business in\n\nWoburn, Massachusetts.    Following the tax years at issue in this\ncase,3 M-USA succeeded M-PR through a merger of M-PR into M-USA.\n\n          The IRS found a deficiency of $815,1964 in M-PR's federal\nincome tax paid for the tax year ending August 31, 1992, and a\n\ndeficiency of $1,705,019 in M-USA's tax payments for the same\n\nperiod.   In   consolidated   cases    in   the   Tax   Court,   M-USA,   as\n\nsuccessor by merger to M-PR, contested both of these claims of\n\ndeficiency.    MedChem,   116 T.C. at 309.          It is the $815,196\nliability that is at issue here.\n\n          During the relevant three-year period -- that is, during\n\neach of M-PR's taxable years ending on August 31, 1990-92 -- all of\nM-PR's reported income was \"intangible property income,\" see 26\n\nU.S.C. § 936(h)(3), attributable to the sale of Avitene, a blood-\n\n\n\n     3\n          When we refer to the \"tax years at issue\" or the \"subject\nyears of this case,\" we mean the three-year period made relevant by\n§ 936(a)(2). That is, the three-year period \"immediately preceding\nthe close of the taxable year.\"        Here, because the alleged\ndeficiency occurred for the tax year ending August 31, 1992, the\nthree-year period runs from September 1, 1989, through August 31,\n1992.\n     4\n          The Tax Court states that the deficiency was $815,196.\nMedChem, 116 T.C. at 309. In contrast, both parties, at various\npoints in their briefs, state that the sum is $815,916. The Notice\nof Deficiency uses both figures. We assume that $815,196 is the\ncorrect figure.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fclotting drug manufactured by Alcon Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"A-PR\"), an\n\nunrelated company.\n\n             On   December     18,    1987,   ten     days    after   M-PR     was\nincorporated, A-PR along with Alcon Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. and Alcon\n\nLaboratories, Inc. (collectively \"Alcon entities\") sold the Avitene\n\nportion of their business to M-PR and M-USA.                 The Alcon entities\nsold the equipment, raw materials, technology, and other assets\n\nassociated    with    Avitene's      manufacturing.      M-USA    acquired     the\n\nreceivables, non-competition agreements, goodwill, contract rights,\n\nrecords, patents and related know-how, trademarks, and Food and\n\nDrug   Administration        approvals.       M-PR    acquired     receivables,\n\ninventory, and title to the machinery and equipment located within\n\nA-PR's manufacturing facility in Humacao, Puerto Rico.                       Those\nassets did not include A-PR's Avitene manufacturing facility in\n\nHumacao.\n\n             Before the acquisition, A-PR had been the manufacturer of\nAvitene.     M-USA had nothing to do with the drug.              Until ten days\n\nprior to the acquisition, M-PR did not exist.            As part of the sale,\n\nA-PR agreed to continue manufacturing Avitene for M-PR using A-PR's\n\nown facility and labor and M-PR's recently-acquired raw materials\n\nand equipment.       A-PR also used the technology acquired by M-USA.\n\nM-PR held title to the in-process and finished Avitene.                       A-PR\n\nshipped finished Avitene from its facility to M-USA, and title\n\npassed to M-USA, the purchaser.           A-PR was solely responsible for\n\nany issues that arose until the finished product was delivered to\n\na carrier for shipment to M-USA.          In return, A-PR sent its invoices\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\ffor its manufacturing services directly to M-USA, which paid, from\n\nM-PR's account, a price equal to the manufacturing cost plus 10%.\n\nThe primary change effected by the 1987 sale was that certain\nassets were held in the name of either M-PR or its parent, M-USA.\n\n             The reason M-PR entered into the processing agreement\n\nwith A-PR, in which A-PR manufactured Avitene for M-PR using M-PR's\nraw materials and equipment, was that M-PR needed to ensure a\n\nsteady supply of Avitene until it built its own manufacturing\n\nfacility in Puerto Rico.      As it turns out, M-PR later abandoned its\n\nplan to construct its own Avitene facility in Puerto Rico.\n\n             During much of the relevant three-year period, M-PR had\n\nno employees.      Its one employee, Mr. Perez, was a former A-PR\n\nemployee.     He worked for M-PR from March 1988 to June 1990 out of\na one-room office that M-PR maintained.          Mr. Perez spent much of\n\nhis   time    planning   M-PR's     transition     to   its     own   Avitene\n\nmanufacturing     facility.       M-PR    also   paid   three    independent\ncontractors to assist Mr. Perez.           M-PR treated the independent\n\ncontractors as nonemployees for payroll and tax purposes.               M-USA\n\nand A-PR employed the individuals, other than Mr. Perez and the\n\nindependent contractors, associated with the Avitene manufacturing\n\nand sales business.\n\n             At the time of the 1987 processing agreement, M-PR and M-\n\nUSA had hoped to establish their own manufacturing facility in\n\nPuerto Rico.      M-PR purchased land in Puerto Rico, on which it\n\nplanned to build its own Avitene manufacturing facility.              In early\n\n1990 M-USA suffered financial reverses causing it to lay off a\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fthird of its workforce and to default on $10 million in debt.            As\n\na result, M-PR suspended its plans to construct a manufacturing\n\nfacility   in   Puerto   Rico.   M-PR    then   wrote    off   its   capital\nexpenditures that had been made on the new facility and closed its\n\nPuerto Rico office.      When the office closed, Perez transferred M-\n\nPR's business records to A-PR and M-USA.          As of July 1, 1990, all\nM-PR checks were issued by M-USA from M-USA's Woburn, Massachusetts\n\noffice.\n\n           In early 1990 M-USA decided to move the manufacturing\n\nequipment and processes from A-PR's Humacao facility to M-USA's\n\nfacility in Woburn.      Significant elements of the equipment were\n\nmoved from Humacao to Woburn by June 1990 and, by January 1991, all\n\nof the manufacturing equipment necessary to perform the first phase\nof the manufacturing process had been moved to Woburn.          In October\n\n1992, first-phase Avitene production commenced in Woburn. By April\n\n1994,   M-USA   had   substantially   completed    the   construction,    in\nWoburn, of its Avitene finished goods manufacturing facility.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           For its tax year ending August 31, 1992, M-PR claimed a\ntax credit under § 936.      The Commissioner determined that M-PR's\n\nAvitene income was not \"derived from the active conduct of a trade\nor business\" within a possession as § 936(a)(2)(B) requires.\nAccordingly, the Commissioner issued a notice of deficiency in the\n\namount of $815,196.\n           M-USA, as successor by merger to M-PR, contested the\n\nasserted deficiency.      On June 27, 2001, the Tax Court entered its\n\n                                  -7-\n\ffinal decision, finding that M-PR was deficient, in the sum of\n\n$815,196, in its federal income tax payments.            The Tax Court\n\nconcluded that M-PR did not meet § 936(a)(2)(B)'s \"active conduct\nof a trade or business within a possession\" requirement.       MedChem,\n\n116 T.C. at 309, 328-29.     The Tax Court held that\n\n            for purposes of section 936(a), a taxpayer actively\n            conducts a trade or business in a U.S. possession only if\n            it participates regularly, continually, extensively, and\n            actively in the management and operation of its profit-\n            motivated activity in that possession. . . . [F]or the\n            purpose of this participation requirement, the services\n            underlying a manufacturing contract may be imputed to a\n            taxpayer only to the extent that the performance of those\n            services is adequately supervised by the taxpayers's own\n            employees.\n\nId. at 336-37.\n            The Tax Court concluded that M-PR did not meet this test.\n\nId. at 337.      It concluded that A-PR and M-USA (located in a\n\nmainland U.S. facility) performed, directed, and controlled all of\nthe business activities related to the manufacture of Avitene. Id.\n\nat 339.    The Tax Court found that, under the processing agreement,\n\nA-PR used its own personnel to manufacture, test, and package the\n\nAvitene at its Humacao facility.          Id. at 317.    A-PR employees\n\nperformed all of the tasks required in the manufacturing process,\n\nincluding the supervision of that manufacturing.        Id. at 317, 339.\n\nIt was M-USA which distributed, marketed, and sold the drug in the\n\nUnited States.     Id.    at 339.    Indeed, the processing agreement\n\nprohibited M-PR from taking a managerial role in the manufacturing\n\nprocess.    Id. at 346.   Any risks associated with M-PR's activities\n\nappear to be minimal, as M-USA had guaranteed payment of any debt,\n\nand performance of any of M-PR's obligations, arising from the\n\n                                    -8-\n\fasset purchase   agreements.     Id.    at   316.     M-USA   consistently\n\nreported, including to the FDA and to the SEC, that the unrelated\n\nentity, A-PR, was the drug's manufacturer.          Id.   This information\nwas also contained on the labels of the drugs.            Id. at 315-16.\n\n           M-PR appeals the Tax Court's decision.\n\n                                 III.\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n           This court reviews the Tax Court's decisions \"in the same\n\nmanner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts\n\nin civil actions tried without a jury.\"         26 U.S.C. § 7482(a)(1)\n(2000); see also Silverman v. Comm'r, 86 F.3d 260, 261 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).   Our standard of review is two-fold.        We review de novo the\nTax Court's statutory and other legal interpretations.            Alexander\n\nv. IRS, 72 F.3d 938, 941 (1st Cir. 1995).           We review its factual\nfindings, including those based on inferences from stipulated\nfacts, for clear error.   Manzoli v. Comm'r, 904 F.2d 101, 103 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).    To the extent that M-PR is making a clear error\nargument with respect to the Tax Court's factual findings, we\nreject the argument.\n           There are no Treasury Department regulations interpreting\n\n§ 936(a),5 nor is the term \"active conduct of a trade or business\"\ndefined for purposes of § 936.   There are, however, some guides to\n\n\n     5\n          Had the Treasury Department promulgated a regulation\ninterpreting § 936(a), we would have been required, absent\ncontradictory statutory language, to defer to a reasonable\ninterpretation. Kikalos v. Comm'r, 190 F.3d 791, 795-96 (7th Cir.\n1999); Snowa v. Comm'r, 123 F.3d 190, 195-96 (4th Cir. 1997).\n\n                                 -9-\n\fstatutory interpretation, which assist us. \"It is well established\n\nin the tax law that an [IRS determination that a taxpayer owes the\n\nFederal Government a certain amount of unpaid taxes] is entitled to\na legal presumption of correctness -- a presumption that can help\n\nthe Government prove its case against a taxpayer in court.\" United\n\nStates v. Fior D'Italia, Inc., No. 01-463, 2002 U.S. LEXIS 4418, at\n*9-10 (U.S. June 17, 2002). Furthermore, income tax deductions and\n\ncredits are matters of legislative grace; the taxpayer bears the\n\nburden of proving entitlement to any deduction or credit claimed.\n\nIndopco, Inc. v. Comm'r, 503 U.S. 79, 84 (1992); New Colonial Ice\n\nCo. v. Helvering, 292 U.S. 435, 440 (1934); Norfolk S. Corp. v.\n\nComm'r, 104 T.C. 13, 36 (investment tax credit), supplemented by\n\n104   T.C.   417   (1995),   aff'd,    140   F.3d   240   (4th   Cir.   1998).\nMoreover, a deduction or credit should be allowed only where there\n\nis \"clear provision therefor.\"         New Colonial Ice Co., 292 U.S. at\n\n440; see also Helvering v. Inter-Mountain Life Ins. Co., 294 U.S.\n686, 689 (1935) (stating that \"[d]eductions are allowed only when\n\nplainly authorized\").6\n\n      6\n          We are not persuaded by M-PR's contention that, if § 936\nis ambiguous, then this court should strictly construe it against\nthe government. Here, we are interpreting a provision permitting\na tax credit, not a provision levying a tax. The Supreme Court has\nstated that in the context of a tax deduction, it is \"not impressed\nby the argument that . . . all doubts should be resolved in favor\nof the taxpayer.\"     White v. United States, 305 U.S. 281, 292\n(1938); see also United States v. Stewart, 311 U.S. 60, 71 (1940)\n(stating that \"those who seek an exemption from a tax must rest it\non more than a doubt or ambiguity\"); Inter-Mountain Life Ins. Co.,\n294 U.S. at 689-90 (holding that deductions must be plainly\nauthorized, not derived from ambiguities). Rather, it is the duty\nof a court to determine \"what [the] construction [of a statute]\nfairly should be.\" White, 305 U.S. at 292. M-PR's argument would\nbe more appropriate were this a case involving a statute imposing\n\n                                      -10-\n\fB. Positions of the Parties\n\n             The parties have presented the court with different\n\ninterpretations of the meaning of § 936(a).                     The Tax Court has, in\n\nits   ruling,      left      each      side       dissatisfied.             Both     sides'\n\ninterpretations          diverge     from     the    Tax    Court's,    although         the\n\ngovernment's position is much closer to the Tax Court's conclusion.\n\n             The Tax Court rejected M-PR's statutory plain meaning\n\nargument. MedChem, 116 T.C. at 328-29.                 Instead, it crafted a test\n\nthat, in the absence of a statutory or regulatory definition of\n\n\"active conduct of a trade or business\" for purposes of § 936(a),\nlooks to regulations defining the phrase as it is used elsewhere in\n\nthe code, bearing in mind the section's legislative intent, id. at\n330-33. Applying this test, the Tax Court rejected interpretations\nmore helpful to the taxpayer, provided in other regulations, see,\n\ne.g., 26 C.F.R. § 1.936-5(c) (2001).                 The applicable test, the Tax\n\nCourt held, was whether the taxpayer \"participates regularly,\n\ncontinually,    extensively,          and     actively     in    the   management        and\noperation of its profit-motivated activity in that possession.\"\nMedChem, 116 T.C. at 336.             It held that to impute a contractor's\nactivities    to    the     taxpayer,       the     taxpayer     had   to    \"adequately\n\nsupervise[]\"       the    provision      of    these       services    with        its   own\n\nemployees.    Id. at 337.          The Tax Court found the facts about M-PR's\n\nrelationship with the contract manufacturer inadequate under its\n\n\n\n\na tax, rather than a statute permitting a tax credit.\n\n                                            -11-\n\fnewly crafted test, and thus found that M-PR is not entitled to the\n\ncredit.   Id. at 337-43.\n\n            The Commissioner rejects M-PR's \"plain meaning\" reading\nof the statute and generally rejects the proposition that use of\n\ncontract manufacturers in possessions is ever sufficient to qualify\n\nfor the § 936(a) tax credit, but allows for rare exceptions where\nthe taxpayer corporation is very heavily involved in the operation\n\nand management of the contract manufacturer.                    The Commissioner\n\nseeks affirmance of the Tax Court's result, but at oral argument\n\nprotested   the   Tax    Court's     test,    which    is     more   beneficial   to\n\ntaxpayers than the IRS's proposed test for what constitutes the\n\nactive conduct of a trade of business.                  The IRS proposes that\n\noutsourced manufacturing may never (well, hardly ever) qualify for\nthe tax credit.         Only in rare instances, when the taxpayer is\n\nheavily involved in the management and control of operations of a\n\ncontract manufacturer, says the IRS, might it qualify.\n            The taxpayer, M-PR, on the other hand, argues that the\n\nstatute's plain meaning does not preclude tax credits to taxpayers\n\nwho use contract manufacturers located in the possessions and that,\n\nif more were required, it has, on the facts, provided the requisite\n\nmore.     M-PR    says   the   Tax    Court    is     wrong    in    its   statutory\n\ninterpretation and in its choice of test.                M-PR asserts that the\n\nTax Court's test is inconsistent with regulations applicable to\n\nother parts of § 936.\n\n            We affirm the denial of the credit and the finding of\n\ndeficiency. In doing so, we assess and reject the taxpayer's plain\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fmeaning arguments, look to the Act's legislative history for\n\nfurther guidance regarding congressional intent in enacting § 936,\n\nand compare the section at issue with the now-repealed Western\nHemisphere Trade Corporation provisions of the Internal Revenue\n\nCode of 1954.   We conclude that, on the facts presented,               M-PR does\n\nnot fall within the language of the statute or Congress's intent.\nWe do so without adopting the Tax Court's proposed test.\n\nC. The Statute and Plain Meaning\n\n          Before analyzing the statute, we think it helpful to\n\nunderstand   the    context   in   which   the    statutory   interpretation\nquestion arises.        \"Possessions   corporations      .    .   .   are   U.S.-\n\nchartered companies that are effectively exempt under section 936\nof the Internal Revenue Code from Federal tax on business income\nand qualified passive investment income from Puerto Rico and\n\ncertain other U.S. possessions.\"            Dep't of the Treasury, The\n\nOperation and Effect of the Possessions Corporation System of\n\nTaxation, Sixth Report 1 (1989) (footnotes omitted).\n\n          The      Treasury   Department    has    described      the    general\noperation of the possessions corporation tax system:\n          The possessions corporation system of taxation is a set\n          of rules under which a U.S. corporation deriving\n          qualifying income from possessions and Puerto Rico pays\n          no income tax to the United States.          As a U.S.\n          corporation, a possessions corporation is subject to\n          federal tax on its worldwide income. However, a special\n          credit available under section 936 fully offsets the\n          federal tax on income from a trade or business in Puerto\n          Rico and from qualified possession source investment\n          income (QPSII). A U.S. parent corporation can, in turn,\n          offset dividends received from a wholly owned 936\n          subsidiary with a 100 percent dividends-received\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f            deduction, which frees the dividend income from federal\n            tax.\nId. at 5.\n\n            With this context, we turn to the statutory language.\n\nThe code section at issue provides, in relevant part:\n            § 936. Puerto Rico and possession tax credit\n            (a) Allowance of credit\n            (1) In general\n                Except as otherwise provided in this section, if a\n            domestic corporation elects the application of this\n            section and if the conditions of both subparagraph (A)\n            and subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2) are satisfied,\n            there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax\n            imposed by this chapter an amount equal to the portion of\n            the tax which is attributable to the sum of --\n                   (A) the taxable income, from sources without the\n                   United States, from --\n                        (i) the active conduct of a trade or\n                        business within a possession of the United\n                        States, or\n                        (ii) the sale or exchange of substantially\n                        all of the assets used by the taxpayer in\n                        the active conduct of such trade or\n                        business, and\n                   (B) the qualified possession source investment\n                   income.\n            (2) Conditions which must be satisfied\n                The conditions referred to in paragraph (1) are:\n                   (A) 3-year period\n                       If 80 percent or more of the gross income of\n                   such domestic corporation for the 3-year period\n                   immediately preceding the close of the taxable\n                   year (or for such part of such period immediately\n                   preceding the close of such taxable year as may\n                   be applicable) was derived from sources within a\n                   possession of the United States (determined\n                   without regard to section 904(f)); and\n                   (B) Trade or business\n                       If 75 percent or more of the gross income of\n                   such domestic corporation for such period or such\n                   part thereof was derived from the active conduct\n                   of a trade or business within a possession of the\n                   United States.\n\n26 U.S.C. § 936(a)(1)-(2).    A separate subsection of § 936 governs\n\nthe tax treatment of possessions corporations' intangible property\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fincome.     26 U.S.C. § 936(h).           The Treasury Department has issued\n\nregulations under § 936(h), see 26 C.F.R. §§ 1.936-4 to -7 (2001),\n\nalthough not under § 936(a).          It is the § 936(a) \"derived from the\nactive conduct of a trade or business\" language that is at issue\n\nhere.     26 U.S.C. § 936(a)(2)(B).\n\n             M-PR   argues     that   §    936(a)    \"requires   only     that   the\ntaxpayer derive its income from an active business rather than a\n\npassive investment.\"       Its argument is really two-fold: first, that\n\n\"active conduct\" means all non-passive conduct; second, that the\n\ntaxpayer corporation need only derive its income from some non-\n\npassive source, meaning that the taxpayer can qualify by deriving\n\nits income from the active conduct of a third party rather than\n\nfrom the taxpayer's own active conduct.                This interpretation, if\naccepted, would mean that a domestic corporation that gets its\n\nincome from the sale of a pharmaceutical product manufactured by a\n\ncontract manufacturer in Puerto Rico, as here, would qualify for\nthe tax credit.     We deal with each argument in turn, rejecting both\n\nparts as contrary to the text of the statute.\n\n             First, M-PR's interpretation, construing income \"derived\n\nfrom the active conduct of a trade or business\" to mean income\n\n\"derived from an active, rather than passive, business,\" renders\n\nthe statutory term \"active\" surplusage. The phrase \"active conduct\n\nof a trade or business\" does not mean that all income derived from\n\nanything that       is   not   a   passive       investment   qualifies    for   the\n\n\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fcredit.7     We    accept   the    Commissioner's     view   that   the    phrase\n\n\"conduct of a trade or business\" alone, without the term \"active,\"\n\ndistinguishes section 936(a) income from passive investment income.\nM-PR's construction renders the term \"active\" redundant.                  That is\n\nnot a permissible form of interpretation.             E.g., New England Power\n\n& Marine, Inc. v. Town of Tyngsborough (In re Middlesex Power\n\nEquip. & Marine, Inc.), No. 01-2314, 2002 WL 1248226, at *4 (1st\n\nCir. June 11, 2002) (stating that \"[w]e assume each term was meant\n\nto have separate content in order to avoid redundancy\").\n\n            Given that the statutory term \"active\" is not surplusage,\n\nwe must determine what independent meaning it adds to the statutory\n\nphrase \"active conduct.\"          Because \"active\" modifies \"conduct,\" we\n\nconclude that \"active conduct\" means something more than simply a\nminimal level of involvement in the process of conducting a trade\n\nor business.       Not all conduct of a trade or business qualifies\n\nunder § 936(a)(2)(B); only \"active conduct\" qualifies. Because the\n\"conduct of a trade or business\" itself requires some level of\n\nactivity,    the    adjective      \"active\"   must,    in    context,     signify\n\nsomething more than a non-zero level of activity.\n\n            The Oxford English Dictionary's first definition of the\n\nnoun \"conduct\" is \"[t]he action of conducting or leading,\" and, as\n\n     7\n          M-PR notes that the Commissioner has previously taken the\nposition that the \"active conduct\" requirement is meant to\ndistinguish between investment income and business income. That\nproposition is different from the proposition M-PR urges here,\nwhich is that the \"active conduct\" requirement is met so long as\nthe taxpayer derives income from any source not wholly passive. To\nsay that the \"active conduct\" requirement distinguishes investment\nincome from business income is not to say that all income other\nthan investment income meets the requirement.\n\n                                      -16-\n\fthe term relates to a business, it is defined as \"[t]he action or\n\nmanner of conducting, directing, managing, or carrying on (any\n\nbusiness . . . etc.).\"               Oxford English Dictionary (2d ed. 1989),\nhttp://dictionary.oed.com.              Similarly, Webster's defines the noun\n\n\"conduct\" as \"the act, manner, or process of carrying out . . . or\n\ncarrying forward (as a business, government, or war).\"                       Webster's\n\nThird    New       International       Dictionary    of    the     English   Language\n\nUnabridged 473 (P.B. Gove et al. eds. 1993).                 \"Active,\" in turn, is\n\ngenerally defined as \"[c]haracterized by action\" and is defined in\n\nterms such as \"[o]riginating or communicating action,\" \"practical,\"\n\n\"working,         effective,    having      practical     operation     or   results.\"\n\nOxford English Dictionary, supra; see also Webster's Third New\n\nInternational Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged, supra,\nat 22 (defining \"active\" as \"characterized by action rather than by\n\ncontemplation or speculation\").\n\n               The mere act, without more, of purchasing products that\nanother unrelated entity has taken the action to manufacture, and\n\nreselling the products to others outside the possession, does not\n\nfit within the meaning of \"active conduct of a trade or business.\"\n\nIn   such     a    case,   it   is    the   unrelated     entity      controlling   and\n\ndirecting the manufacturing that is actively conducting the trade\n\nor business.\n\n               Here, the Tax Court was \"not even able to find that M-\n\nP.R.    had       any   meaningful     business     activity     in    Puerto   Rico.\"\n\nMedChem, 116 T.C. at 337.               It found that M-PR's \"involvement in\n\nPuerto Rico during the 3-year period failed even to qualify as a\n\n\n                                            -17-\n\ftrade or business in Puerto Rico,\" id. at 338, never mind as an\n\nactively conducted trade or business.   It concluded that A-PR and\n\nM-USA, but not M-PR, directed and controlled \"[a]ll of the business\nactivities connected to Avitene,\" id., and that A-PR \"performed\n\nevery task required in the manufacturing process,\" without the\n\nability of M-PR \"to manage, direct, or control any part of the\nmanufacturing process,\" id. at 339.      These findings were not\n\nclearly erroneous.     On these facts, we are confident in the\n\nconclusion that M-PR did not itself actively conduct a trade or\n\nbusiness.\n\n            The remaining question is whether A-PR's manufacturing\n\nactivities may be attributed to M-PR for the purposes of § 936(a).\n\nThe answer to this question hinges on M-PR's second claim, that the\nstatutory phrase requires only that the income \"derived\" by the\n\ntaxpayer be from some third party engaged in the active conduct of\n\na trade or business.   We reject this claim as well.   Both the Tax\nCourt and the Commissioner interpret § 936(a) as requiring that the\n\ntaxpayer, not someone else, be the entity engaged in the active\n\nconduct of a trade or business.   We agree.\n\n            First, this reading is the most natural reading of the\n\nstatutory requirement that at least 75% of the taxpayer's gross\n\nincome during the relevant period be \"derived from the active\n\nconduct of a trade or business within a possession of the United\n\nStates.\"    26 U.S.C. § 936(a)(2)(B).   M-PR correctly notes that\n\nCongress could have more explicitly said, \"the active conduct by\n\nthe taxpayer of a trade or business\" and it did not.   But Congress\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fmight have concluded that the addition of the phrase would be\n\nredundant, given the preceding discussion and especially given that\n\nthe    taxpayer   corporation      is   the    only   actor   referenced     in    §\n936(a)(1)-(2).     Congress could also have said \"the active conduct\n\nby    the   taxpayer    or   any   contract    manufacturer    of   a     trade   or\n\nbusiness,\" which is M-PR's reading, and it did not.                         Viewed\nmyopically, the statutory phrase is silent on whose \"active conduct\n\nof a trade or business\" it refers to, but, viewed in context, the\n\nbest reading is that it means the taxpayer's own active conduct.\n\nAmbiguity in this instance does not assist M-PR because a deduction\n\nor credit should be allowed only where there is \"clear provision\n\ntherefor.\"     New Colonial Ice Co., 292 U.S. at 440.          M-PR has simply\n\nnot met its burden of proving entitlement to the § 936 credit\nclaimed.\n\n             To read the statute as requiring only that the income be\n\nderived from a third party's active conduct would eliminate the\ndistinction between active conduct income and all other income,\n\nincluding     passive    investment      income.      Virtually     all    passive\n\ninvestment income, for example, is derived, somewhere down the\n\nchain, by some entity's active conduct of a trade or business.\n\n             Finally, as discussed below, the legislative history\n\nconfirms Congress's intent to require the taxpayer claiming the\n\ncredit to itself be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or\n\nbusiness.      If M-PR's interpretation were correct, then upon the\n\n1976 enactment of § 936, see Tax Reform Act of 1976, Pub. L. No.\n\n94-455, § 1051, 90 Stat. 1520, 1643-47 (1976) (current version at\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\f26   U.S.C.    §   936   (2000)),   all   domestic   corporations   that   had\n\ncontract manufacturers in Puerto Rico (and otherwise met the\n\nnumerical requirements) would automatically have become eligible\nfor the tax credit.       This is, in our view, highly improbable on its\n\nface.   It is particularly improbable given the legislative history\n\ndiscussed below.\n\nD. Legislative History and Western Hemisphere Trading\n   Corporations\n\n              1. Legislative history.\n\n              As stated above, at issue in this case is the proper\n\ninterpretation of § 936's \"active conduct of a trade or business\"\nlanguage.      Section 936 in general, and the \"active conduct of a\ntrade or business\" language in particular, have their roots in much\nolder legislation.        Before analyzing the legislative history as it\npertains to the meaning of the relevant statutory phrase, we\n\ndescribe § 936's predecessors.\n              Both § 936 and the basic structure of today's possessions\ncorporation tax system have their genesis in a provision of the\n\nRevenue Act of 1921.        See Revenue Act of 1921, Pub. L. No. 67-98,\n\n§ 262, 42 Stat. 227, 271 (1921).              The phrase we interpret --\n\"derived from the active conduct of a trade or business\" -- first\n\nappeared in the Revenue Act of 1921, though in a slightly different\n\ncontext.      Compare id. with 26 U.S.C. § 936(a)(2)(B).       The 1921 Act\n\nexempted a domestic corporation from federal taxes on foreign-\n\nsource income if, for the three years preceding the close of the\n\ntaxable year, it derived at least 80% of its gross income from\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fsources within a possession and 50% or more of its gross income\n\n\"from the active conduct of a trade or business\" within the\n\npossessions.       § 262, 42 Stat. at 271.               Congress enacted this\nsection of the 1921 Act to eliminate the competitive disadvantage\n\nthat U.S.     corporations        were   suffering      as   a   result    of    double\n\ntaxation of income earned outside the U.S. and to encourage U.S.\nbusiness investments in U.S. possessions.                See S. Rep. No. 67-275\n\n(1921), reprinted in 1939-1 C.B. (pt. 2) 181, 187; see generally\n\nCoca-Cola Co. v. Comm'r, 106 T.C. 1, 21 (1996) (describing the 1921\n\nAct   and    its   progeny);      N.H.

Rev. 531, 533-37 (same).\n\n             Congress carried forward, without material change, the\n1921 Act's possessions corporation exemption into section 931 of\n\nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1954.               See Internal Revenue Code of\n\n1954, Pub. L. No. 83-591, § 931, 68A Stat. 3, 291 (1954).                       Section\n931   used   the   same    language      as     the   1921    Act's    section       262,\n\nrequiring,     among      other    things,       that   50%      or   more      of    the\ncorporation's gross income be \"derived from the active conduct of\n\na trade or business.\"       § 931(a)(2), 68A Stat. at 291.8               Section 931\n\n      8\n             The 1954 Internal Revenue Code provided, in relevant\npart:\n\n             Sec. 931. Income From Sources Within Possessions of the\n             United States.\n\n             (a) General Rule. -- In the case of citizens of the\n             United States or domestic corporations, gross income\n             means only gross income from sources within the United\n             States if the conditions of both paragraph (1) and\n             paragraph (2) are satisfied:\n\n                                         -21-\n\fremained in effect without material change until the mid-1970s,\n\nwhen Congress enacted legislation approximating the current version\n\nof 26 U.S.C. § 936.   See G.D. Searle & Co. v. Comm'r, 88 T.C. 252,\n350-52 (1987) (describing the genesis of § 936).\n\n          Section 1051 of the 1976 Tax Reform Act added a new U.S.\n\nCode section, 26 U.S.C. § 936.   See Tax Reform Act of 1976, Pub. L.\n\nNo. 94-455, § 1051, 90 Stat. 1520, 1643-47 (1976) (current version\n\nat 26 U.S.C. § 936 (2000)). Section 936 partially replaced section\n\n931, as it relates to Puerto Rico.9     See id.   The 1976 legislation\n\n\n\n               (1) Three-year period. -- If 80 percent or more of\n               the gross income of such citizen or domestic\n               corporation (computed without the benefit of this\n               section)   for  the   3-year  period   immediately\n               preceding the close of the taxable year . . . was\n               derived from sources within a possession of the\n               United States; and\n               (2) Trade or business. -- If --\n\n                      (A) in the case of such corporation, 50\n                      percent or more of its gross income (computed\n                      without the benefit of this section) for such\n                      period . . . was derived from the active\n                      conduct of a trade or business within a\n                      possession of the United States . . . .\n\n§ 931, 68A Stat. at 291.\n     9\n          Section 936 did not entirely replace section 931. The\nthen-existing provision -- 26 U.S.C. § 931 -- was retained, but\nonly for qualifying \"individual citizens,\" as opposed to\ncorporations. In addition, it was made inapplicable to Puerto Rico\nby defining \"possession,\" for purposes of section 931, not to\ninclude Puerto Rico. § 1051(c), 90 Stat. at 1645. In the case of\ndomestic corporations deriving the requisite income from Puerto\nRico and deriving the requisite income from active conduct of a\ntrade or business in Puerto Rico, the § 936 credit is available.\nSee 26 U.S.C. § 936. In the case of qualifying U.S. individual\ncitizens, the Puerto Rican source income exclusion is now contained\nin 26 U.S.C. § 933.\n\n                                 -22-\n\feffected a number of revisions in prior law.       To focus on the\n\nrevision central to this case, the new § 936 transformed the old\n\nsection 931 exemption mechanism into a tax credit.       The credit\npermits domestic corporations to offset U.S. taxes on income\n\n\"derived from the active conduct of a trade or business\" in Puerto\n\nRico, if certain prerequisites are met.     § 1051(b), 90 Stat. at\n1644.10   We rely on the Treasury Department's 1989 Report, which\n\ndescribed the transition from the 1921 Act to the 1976 Act:\n\n           The possessions corporation exemption remained unchanged\n           until the Tax Reform Act of 1976.        Many U.S. firms\n           established plants in Puerto Rico after 1948, when Puerto\n           Rico enacted a program of tax exemption for manufacturing\n           firms. Before the 1976 Act was implemented, proponents\n           of continued U.S. tax exemption argued that the\n           possessions corporation system of taxation was needed to\n           offset the U.S. minimum wage requirement, the requirement\n           to use U.S. flag vessels in transporting goods to the\n           United States, and other Federally imposed requirements\n           that tended to reduce Puerto Rico's ability to compete\n           with neighboring countries for U.S. investment.\n           By enacting the Tax Reform Act of 1976, Congress wanted\n           to leave undisturbed the tax exemption of earnings from\n           a trade or business in Puerto Rico or from investments\n           made with those earnings for Puerto Rican use. At the\n           same time, Congress wished to end the exemption for\n           passive income from funds invested in foreign capital\n           markets and to hasten their repatriation if not used in\n           the possession. . . .\n\n           To   continue  promoting   Puerto  Rico's   industrial\n           development, the Tax Reform Act of 1976 therefore left\n           intact the exemption for income derived by U.S.\n\n     10\n          Since 1976, there have been many amendments to the\npossessions corporations taxation system in general and to § 936 in\nparticular, including those imposed by the Tax Equity and Fiscal\nResponsibility Act of 1982, Pub. L. No. 97-248, 96 Stat. 324\n(1982), and by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-514, 100\nStat. 2085 (1986). We do not analyze these changes. The text of\nthe provision we construe, 26 U.S.C. § 936(a)(2)(B), has remained\nunchanged since 1976, except that its 50% \"trade or business\"\nrequirement is now a 75% requirement.\n\n                                -23-\n\f          corporations from operations in a possession. It also\n          exempted from tax the dividends remitted by a possessions\n          corporation to its U.S. parent. To prevent the avoidance\n          of tax on income invested in foreign countries by\n          possessions corporations, however, the Tax Reform Act\n          eliminated the exemption for income derived outside the\n          possessions.    The changes in the tax treatment of\n          possessions corporations were effected by removing\n          possessions corporations from section 931 of the Internal\n          Revenue Code and placing them into a newly created Code\n          section 936.\nThe Operation and Effect of the Possessions Corporation System of\n\nTaxation, supra, at 6.\n\n          As   to   the   problem   before   us,   the   Treasury   Report\n\ndescribed the effect of the change:\n          Change in the scope of and method of effecting the tax\n          exemption. Before 1976, a possessions corporation was\n          exempt from U.S. tax on all income derived from sources\n          outside the United States. Under the Tax Reform Act of\n          1976, the exemption was limited to two kinds of income:\n          --        Income from the active conduct of a trade or\n                    business in a possession, or from the sale or\n                    exchange of substantially all of the assets used\n                    by the corporation in the active conduct of such\n                    trade or business; and\n          --        QPSII, which is non-business income derived from\n                    the possession in which the corporation has its\n                    trade or business and which is attributable to\n                    the investment of funds derived from such trade\n                    or business for use within the possession.\n          Rather than exempting the income from U.S. taxation,\n          section 936 provides a credit equal to (and, therefore,\n          fully offsetting) the U.S. tax on the income.        The\n          section 936 credit is not available for other income\n          earned by a possessions corporation. However, a regular\n          foreign tax credit may be claimed for foreign (including\n          possession) taxes paid or accrued with respect to income\n          that does not qualify for the 936 credit.\nId. at 7 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\f           The House and Senate Reports are virtually identical on\n\nthe pertinent provision.      See H.R. Rep. No. 94-658, at 253-60\n\n(1975), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2897, 3149-56; S. Rep. No.\n94-938, at 277-84 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3438,\n\n3707-13.   The Reports discuss the tax treatment of corporations\n\nconducting trade or business in possessions of the U.S. as well as\nissues arising under the now-repealed Western Hemisphere Trade\n\nCorporation provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,\n\n§§ 921-922, 68A Stat. at 290-91 (repealed in 1976 for taxable years\n\nafter 1979).     See H.R. Rep. No. 94-658 at 253-60; S. Rep. No. 94-\n\n938 at 277-84.\n\n           Describing the law as it existed prior to the enactment\n\nof the Tax Reform Act of 1976, the House and Senate Reports recite\nthat\n\n           [u]nder present law, corporations operating a trade or\n           business in a possession of the United States are\n           entitled to exclude from gross income all income from\n           sources without the United States, including foreign\n           source income earned outside of the possession in which\n           they conduct business operations, if they meet two\n           conditions.\nH.R. Rep. No. 94-658 at 253-54 (emphasis added); see also S. Rep.\n\nNo. 94-938 at 277.    With this in mind, a new provision, 26 U.S.C.\n\n§ 936, was added \"for the tax treatment of U.S. corporations\n\noperating in Puerto Rico.\"    H.R. Rep. No. 94-658 at 256 (emphasis\n\nadded); see also S. Rep. No. 94-938 at 279.           We think this\n\nlanguage supports the Commissioner's view that the taxpayer must be\n\nthe one actively conducting the trade or business.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\f             As   to    the       changes    in    the    possessions          tax    credit\n\nlegislation, Congress stated that it sought to \"assist the U.S.\n\npossessions in obtaining employment-producing investments by U.S.\ncorporations, while at the same time encouraging those corporations\n\nto   bring   back      to   the    United    States      the    earnings       from       these\n\ninvestments to the extent they cannot be reinvested productively in\nthe possession.\"        H.R. Rep. No. 94-658 at 255; see also S. Rep. No.\n\n94-938 at 279 (using the same language). The congressional history\n\nreflects a dual intention to stimulate investment, both active and\n\npassive, in Puerto Rico and to encourage the growth of new jobs in\n\nPuerto Rico.      H.R. Rep. No. 94-658 at 255; S. Rep. No. 94-938 at\n\n279 (same).         Those are related but not identical objectives.\n\nCongress's emphasis on the creation of new jobs by operating\ncompanies is also reflected by the fact that Congress mandated that\n\nthe Department of the Treasury report to it periodically on the\n\nprogress in meeting that goal.                See H.R. Rep. No. 94-658 at 259\n\n(stating that the Department of the Treasury's reports are to\n\ninclude,     among      other      things,    \"an     analysis     of      .    .     .    the\n[provision's]        effects       on   investment       and     employment          in    the\n\npossessions\"); S. Rep. No. 94-938 at 282 (same).\n\n             Although       the     Department      of    the     Treasury          has    not\n\npromulgated regulations under § 936(a), its reports provide data\n\nboth on how Treasury has interpreted that section and on the\n\ncontext of the legislation.             We look, in particular, to Treasury's\n\n1989 Report.         See The Operation and Effect of the Possessions\n\nCorporation System of Taxation, supra.                   The 1989 Report provides\n\n                                            -26-\n\finsight into Treasury's interpretation of § 936.                  For example, the\n\n1989 Report says \"[b]y enacting section 936, Congress sought to\n\nassist Puerto Rico in obtaining employment-producing investments.\"\nId. at 3; see also id. at 46 (same).             Accordingly, Treasury matched\n\n\"possessions corporations' U.S. income tax returns with payroll and\n\nemployment data from the companies' federal unemployment insurance\ntax   returns\"     to    determine       \"whether   this   objective       has    been\n\nattained.\"       Id. at 46.      In particular, Treasury sought to measure\n\nthe \"direct employment associated with section 936 companies.\" Id.\n\n             For example, as of 1989, Puerto Rican business expansion\n\nhad     \"been    concentrated       in    four   high-technology      industries:\n\nchemicals       (including    pharmaceuticals),      scientific      instruments,\n\nelectrical and electronic equipment, and machinery.\"                   Id. at 27.\nFrom 1970 to 1988, the chemical industry's earned income grew from\n\n11%     to   44%   of    total      income    originating    in     Puerto       Rican\n\nmanufacturing.          Id.    Nearly all of the investments in those\nindustries were made by possessions corporations.                   Id. at 27-29.\n\nIndeed, in 1983, about 62% of the employees in the Puerto Rican\n\nmanufacturing sector were employed by possessions corporations;\n\nthis represents about 12% of Puerto Rico's total employment.                       Id.\n\nat 3.    As the 1989 Treasury Department Report makes clear, most of\n\nthe corporations that qualified to receive the possessions tax\n\ncredit were manufacturing corporations.              Id. at 31.\n\n             On the whole, the views on eligibility for the tax credit\n\nexpressed both in the legislative history and in the Treasury\n\nDepartment's       Report     are   more     consistent    with    those     of    the\n\n\n                                          -27-\n\fCommissioner and the Tax Court than those of M-PR.              Those views are\n\nnot binding on us, but they have some weight.         Both sources tend to\n\nsupport the Commissioner's view that § 936(a) requires that the\ntaxpayer itself actively conduct a trade or business, with the\n\nexpectation being that this active conduct by the taxpayer would\n\nincrease employment and investment in Puerto Rico.                Both sources\ncontemplate that the taxpayer be the party employing workers in the\n\nPuerto Rican economy.\n\n            Here, the Tax Court's conclusion, which was not clearly\n\nerroneous, was that M-PR's investment in Puerto Rico's economy was\n\nvirtually      nonexistent.     MedChem,   116     T.C.    at    337.     M-PR's\n\nactivities in Puerto Rico \"failed even to qualify as a trade or\n\nbusiness in Puerto Rico,\" id. at 338, much less as an actively\nconducted one.      A-PR and M-USA directed and controlled \"[a]ll of\n\nthe business activities connected to Avitene.\"             Id.    Furthermore,\n\nduring   the     relevant   three-year   period,    M-PR    placed      only   one\nemployee in Puerto Rico. That employee, Mr. Perez, worked for M-PR\n\nout of a one-room office for less than one year of the requisite\nthree-year period.\n\n            2.    Western Hemisphere Trade Corporations\n\n            M-PR urges that we follow the construction that some\ncourts have given to the phrase \"active conduct of a trade or\nbusiness\" under the Western Hemisphere Trade Corporation (\"WHTC\")\n\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, § 921, 68A Stat.\nat 290, that were repealed in 1976.         Section 921 defined \"Western\n\nHemisphere trade corporation\" to mean \"a domestic corporation all\n\n                                    -28-\n\fof whose business . . . is done in any . . . countries in North,\n\nCentral, or South America, or in the West Indies, and which\n\nsatisfies\" two requirements.     Id.    One requirement was that at\nleast 95% of the corporation's gross income for the three preceding\n\nyears be derived from sources outside of the United States.     Id.\n\nThe other was that at least 90% of the corporation's gross income\nfor the three preceding years be \"derived from the active conduct\n\nof a trade or business.\"   Id.\n\n          Although at first cut the WHTC provision appears to be an\n\napt point of comparison, ultimately this analogy does not assist M-\n\nPR. This is primarily because of the important differences between\n\nthe purposes of the WHTC provision and § 936.\n\n          Congress may, particularly in the internal revenue code,\nuse the same phrase, such as \"active conduct of         a trade or\n\nbusiness,\" in attempts to reach different ends.    The Supreme Court\n\nmade this point in Commissioner v. Groetzinger, 480 U.S. 23 (1987).\n\nAfter noting that the phrase \"trade or business\" appeared in over\n\nfifty sections of the Code, the Court stated: \"[I]n this opinion\nour interpretation of the phrase 'trade or business' is confined to\n\nthe specific sections of the Code at issue here.   We do not purport\n\nto construe the phrase where it appears in other places.\"    Id. at\n\n27 & n.8. Other circuits construing the phrase \"trade or business\"\n\nhave also concluded that the phrase has different meanings in\n\ndifferent sections of the Internal Revenue Code.       In Hughes v.\n\nCommissioner, 38 F.2d 755 (10th Cir. 1930), for example, the Tenth\n\nCircuit, construing the statutory phrase \"trade or business\" in\n\n\n                                 -29-\n\fsection 204(a) of the Revenue Act of 1921, Pub. L. No. 67-98,\n\n§ 204(a), 42 Stat. 227, 231 (1921), stated that \"[w]e are here\n\nconcerned only with the meaning of this phrase as used in this\nsection. The same phrase, in other statutes, or in other sections,\n\nin a different context, and for a different purpose, may or may not\n\nbe helpful.\"    Hughes, 38 F.2d at 757.     This is not to say that the\nWHTC provision is necessarily inapposite, but rather simply to\n\nemphasize, as we have emphasized in other contexts, that \"the same\n\nwords may play different roles in different contexts.\"           Walker v.\n\nExeter, 284 F.3d 42, 45 n.4 (1st Cir. 2002).       The relevance of the\n\nWHTC provision, then, turns on its similarity to the provision at\n\nissue here.\n\n             The Tax Court has described the legislative history of\nthe WHTC provision as disclosing a congressional \"desire to offset\n\nthrough a tax preference the competitive disadvantage suffered by\n\ncertain American corporations abroad on account of the less onerous\ntaxes   to   which   their   non-American   competitors   were   subject.\"\n\nKewanee Oil Co. v. Comm'r, 62 T.C. 728, 737 (1974).         Accordingly,\n\n             [i]t follows that when the \"active conduct\" requirement\n             is read in the context from which it arose, namely the\n             threat of foreign competition, one might well conclude\n             that in passing the Western Hemisphere provisions\n             Congress intended to grant relief to United States\n             business activity in the Americas only to the extent that\n             the beneficiary corporation conducted active business\n             operations abroad vulnerable to the competitive threat\n             posed by the tax-advantaged corporations of other\n             countries.\n\nId. at 737-38.\n\n             Like the WHTC provision, the possessions tax credit was\n\nmeant to offset the competitive disadvantage suffered by American\n\n                                   -30-\n\fcompanies. The possessions tax credit, however, was meant not only\n\nto offset certain impediments for U.S. corporations investing in\n\nPuerto Rico, but also to increase investment and employment-\nproducing opportunities in Puerto Rico.            This is a difference that\n\nmakes a difference.        To the extent that the WHTC provision was\n\nmeant   to    increase    the    foreign     competitiveness     of    domestic\ncorporations,     the    geographic     location   of   those   corporations'\n\noperations was relevant only to a limited extent -- that is, it was\n\nimportant only to ensure that the domestic corporation actually\n\nengaged in some foreign commerce. In contrast, the possessions tax\n\ncredit was meant, in addition to advancing the competitiveness of\n\ndomestic     corporations,      to   stimulate   investment     in    particular\n\nplaces, including Puerto Rico.           On this account, unlike the WHTC\nprovision, the location of the corporation's trade or business was\n\ncritical to advancing this goal.         After all, the goal is promoting\n\ninvestment in the possessions -- a goal the attainment of which is\nintrinsically tied to the location of the investments made.\n\n             M-PR relies on Frank v. International Canadian Corp., 308\n\nF.2d 520 (9th Cir. 1962), a Ninth Circuit decision applying the\n\nWHTC provision of section 109 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.\n\nIt is far from clear that this court would have viewed Frank's\n\nfacts the same way and reached the same outcome as did the Ninth\n\nCircuit, even under the WHTC.\n\n             In Frank, the Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Corporation\n\nof Washington, a domestic corporation that regularly conducted\n\nbusiness activities in British Columbia, decided to assume new\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\fshipping responsibilities. Id. at 522-23. For legitimate business\n\nreasons having to do with the most favored nation clauses in its\n\ncontracts and the Robinson-Patman Act's prohibitions, Washington\ndecided to form a new corporation, named International Canadian\n\nCorporation, as a WHTC, in order to perform the shipping.                       Id.\n\nInternational, in turn, had one full-time employee and assumed the\nparent's sales functions.       Id.    International did utilize services\n\nof Washington's employees and paid for those services. Id. at 523.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit held, on review of a district court decision,\n\nthat   International,   which     came     into    existence     for    legitimate\n\nbusiness    reasons   unrelated       to   the     WHTC    provision,    was   not\n\ndisqualified from the WHTC credit although it had assumed former\n\nbusiness    of   Washington,     utilized         and     paid   for   help    from\nWashington's employees, and did not have a source of supply or\n\ncustomers independent of Washington's.              Id. at 526-27.      The court\n\nfound that International clearly was active, earning its income by\nperforming a variety of services relating to the sale of chemical\n\nproducts.    Id. at 525-27.\n\n            The Ninth Circuit's opinion is of limited utility because\n\nof the factual distinctions between it and the case here.                      For\n\nexample, Frank found that International's existence was justified\n\nby a legitimate business purpose.          Id. at 526.       At least from early\n\n1990, when M-USA had decided not to build a manufacturing plant in\n\nPuerto Rico, it is difficult to view M-PR as anything other than a\n\ncorporate shell with little business reason to exist other than to\n\nattempt to secure the § 936 credit.                     Furthermore, as already\n\n\n                                      -32-\n\fdiscussed, the divergent policy goals of the possessions tax credit\n\nand the WHTC provision mean that the analogy is strained from the\n\nstart.     Nothing in the history of the WHTC leads us to the\ntaxpayer's interpretation.\n\nE.    Analogy to Other Regulatory Definitions\n\n            The Tax Court found twenty-two uses of the phrase \"active\n\nconduct of a trade or business\" in the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nMedChem, 116 T.C. at 330 & n.13.        M-PR argues that the Tax Court\n\nerred in looking by analogy to regulations interpreting \"active\n\nconduct of a trade or business\" as used in 26 U.S.C. §§ 179, 355,\nand 367, for purposes of interpreting the phrase as used in § 936.11\n\n\n      11\n          The sections    selected   by   the   Tax   Court   concern   the\nfollowing matters:\n\n(1)   26 U.S.C. § 179 (2000). Section 179 deals with the election\n      to expense certain depreciable business assets. It states, in\n      part, that \"[a] taxpayer may elect to treat the cost of any\n      section 179 property as an expense which is not chargeable to\n      capital account.\"    Id. § 179(a).   It defines \"Section 179\n      property,\" for purposes of § 179, as \"any tangible property\n      (to which section 168 applies) which is section 1245 property\n      (as defined in section 1245(a)(3)) and which is acquired by\n      purchase for use in the active conduct of a trade or\n      business.\" Id. § 179(d)(1) (emphasis added).\n\n(2)   26 U.S.C. § 355 (2000).      Section 355 deals with the\n      distribution of stock and securities of a controlled\n      corporation. Section 355(a)'s provisions apply\n\n           only if either -- (A) the distributing corporation, and\n           the controlled corporation . . . is engaged immediately\n           after the distribution in the active conduct of a trade\n           or business, or (B) immediately before the distribution,\n           the distributing corporation had no assets other than\n           stock or securities in the controlled corporations and\n           each   of  the   controlled   corporations  is   engaged\n           immediately after the distribution in the active conduct\n           of a trade or business.\n\n                                 -33-\n\fThe   argument   is   that   the   purposes   of    those    sections   are   so\n\ndifferent from the purpose of § 936 that their selection was\n\narbitrary.\n             We do not think the selection was arbitrary.           We analyze\n\none example to demonstrate our point.              M-PR says the regulation\n\nunder § 179 is not analogous because that regulation is explicit:\nit refers to a trade or business \"actively conducted by the\n\ntaxpayer.\"    26 C.F.R. § 1.179-2(c)(6) (2001) (emphasis added).              It\n\nstates, in part, that \"a taxpayer generally is considered to\n\nactively conduct a trade or business if the taxpayer meaningfully\n\nparticipates in the management or operations of the trade or\n\nbusiness.    A mere passive investor in a trade or business does not\n\nactively conduct the trade or business.\"            Id.     As stated earlier,\nour view is that the \"by the taxpayer\" requirement is implicit in\n\n§ 936, and so the analogy to 26 C.F.R. § 1.179-2(c)(6) is not\n\nstrained.\n             M-PR argues that the more appropriate analogy is to 26\n\nU.S.C. § 936(h)(5), and guidance provided thereunder, which, M-PR\n\n\n\n\n      Id. § 355(b)(1) (emphases added).\n\n(3)   26 U.S.C. § 367 (2000).      Section 367 deals with foreign\n      corporations. It provides that, if in connection with certain\n      defined exchanges, United States persons transfer property to\n      foreign corporations, \"such foreign corporation shall not, for\n      purposes of determining the extent to which gain shall be\n      recognized on such transfer, be considered to be a\n      corporation.\" Id. § 367(a)(1). But, in general, § 367(a)(1)\n      does \"not apply to any property transferred to a foreign\n      corporation for use by such foreign corporation in the active\n      conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States.\"\n      Id. § 367(a)(3)(A) (emphasis added).\n\n                                     -34-\n\fsays, contemplates the use of contract manufacturers. That section\n\nstates, in relevant part, that\n\n          an electing corporation shall not be treated as having a\n          significant business presence in a possession with\n          respect to a product produced in whole or in part by the\n          electing corporation in the possession . . . unless such\n          product is manufactured or produced in the possession by\n          the electing corporation within the meaning of subsection\n          (d)(1)(A) of section 954.\n26 U.S.C. § 936(h)(5).   Section 954(d)(1)(A) states that\n\n          the term \"foreign base company sales income\" means income\n          . . . derived in connection with the purchase of personal\n          property from a related person and its sale to any\n          person, the sale of personal property to any person on\n          behalf of a related person, the purchase of personal\n          property from any person and its sale to a related\n          person, or the purchase of personal property from any\n          person on behalf of a related person where -- (A) the\n          property which is purchased (or in the case of property\n          sold on behalf of a related person, the property which is\n          sold) is manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted\n          outside the country under the laws of which the\n          controlled foreign corporation is created or organized.\n\n26 U.S.C. § 954(d)(1) (2000).       M-PR says that it relied on a\n\nRevenue Ruling concluding that, under § 954, when a \"controlled\nforeign corporation\" contracts out a manufacturing process to\n\nanother manufacturer, the contract manufacturer's performance is\nconsidered to be performance by the controlled foreign corporation.\n\nSee Rev. Rul. 75-7, 1975-1 C.B. 244.    M-PR says § 936(a)(2) must be\n\nread, in light of Revenue Ruling 75-7, not to require the taxpayer\n\nactually to supervise the contract manufacturer's activities.\n\n          The two sections, however, measure different things.    As\n\nthe Commissioner points out, the Revenue Ruling allows contract\n\nmanufacturing to be taken into account in narrow situations, not\n\npresent here. Section 936(h)(1) taxes \"intangible property income\"\n\n\n                                 -35-\n\fto the U.S. shareholder of the § 936 corporation unless the § 936\n\ncorporation elects either the cost sharing or profit split method.\n\nSee 26 U.S.C. § 936(h)(5)(C).       To make that election, the § 936\ncorporation must have a \"significant business presence\" (\"SBP\") in\n\nthe possession as to that product or service.          In order to show a\n\n\"significant business presence\" certain numerical tests must be met\nand, in addition, the product must be manufactured or produced in\n\nthe possession within the meaning of § 954(d)(1)(A).             For these\n\nstated purposes, contract manufacturing costs may be attributed to\n\nthe taxpayer as allowed by the regulations. Those regulations, for\n\npurposes of the SBP requirement, permit a possessions corporation\n\nto treat the cost of contract manufacturing as a cost of direct\n\nlabor.    See 26 C.F.R. § 1.936-5(c).     The purpose appears to be to\npermit a taxpayer who has already satisfied the 75% \"active conduct\n\nof a trade or business\" requirement then to obtain § 936 credit for\n\nthe contract manufactured product. We reject the argument that the\nsection 936(h)(5) provisions govern by analogy the initial question\n\nof what is meant by the active conduct of a trade or business.12\n\nF. Application of Section 936(a) to the Facts\n\n            Under   our   understanding   of   the   statutory   term,   the\n\nrequisite gross income of M-PR, over the relevant three-year time\n\n\n\n     12\n           The taxpayer relies on cases arising under other\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code, which hold that a taxpayer\nneed not manufacture its own product but may be a manufacturer by\nuse of a contract manufacturer. See Suzy's Zoo v. Comm'r, 273 F.3d\n875, 879 (9th Cir. 2001); Polaroid Corp. v. United States, 235 F.2d\n276, 278 (1st Cir. 1956). Those cases address different problems.\nOne size does not fit all.\n\n                                   -36-\n\fperiod, was not \"derived from the active conduct of a trade or\n\nbusiness within a possession of the United States.\"                26 U.S.C. §\n\n936(a)(2)(B).      This is because M-PR was not engaged in the active\nconduct of a trade or business in Puerto Rico for the three\n\npreceding years.      The Tax Court was \"not even able to find that\n\nMedChem P.R. had any meaningful business activity in Puerto Rico.\"\nMedChem, 116 T.C. at 337.      We agree that, whatever M-PR's presence\n\nin Puerto Rico, over the relevant time-period, it did not actively\n\nconduct a trade or business there.           A-PR and M-USA, but not M-PR,\n\ndirected and controlled all of the Avitene business activities. A-\n\nPR performed the tasks required in the manufacturing process,\n\nwithout the ability of M-PR to control any part of that process.\n\n            During much of the relevant three-year period, M-PR had\nno employees.       Its one employee, Mr. Perez, was a former A-PR\n\nemployee who worked out of a one-room office maintained by M-PR.\n\nHe worked for M-PR from March 1988 to June 1990, though only about\nten months of his employment occurred during the relevant three-\n\nyear period.      M-PR argues that, for other reasons, A-PR activities\n\nmust be attributed to M-PR, and that A-PR employees are M-PR's\n\nemployees.    The Tax Court adopted as its definition of an employee\n\nof   M-PR   the   definition   used    by    the   IRS   to   determine   if   an\n\nindividual is an employee for payroll tax and withholding purposes.\n\nSee MedChem, 116 T.C. at 341-43 (citing 26 C.F.R. § 31.3401(c)-1(b)\n\n(stating, among other things, that \"if an individual is subject to\n\nthe control or direction of another merely as to the result to be\n\naccomplished by the work and not as to the means and methods for\n\n\n                                      -37-\n\faccomplishing the result, he is not an employee\")).        Under that\n\napproach, neither A-PR nor the contract employees meet the test.\n\nNor do those M-USA employees who served as M-PR officers but\nreceived no compensation from M-PR.       We think the Tax Court's\n\napproach was correct because we agree that none of the purported M-\n\nPR employees were subject to M-PR's control as to the means and\nmethods of carrying out the production and sale of Avitene.      Even\n\nwere this not the case, we also think it significant that, until\n\nthis litigation, M-PR consistently treated these individuals as\n\nnonemployees for tax purposes.\n\n            Finally, M-PR makes a policy argument that it should be\n\nwithin the scope of the tax credit because it created jobs in the\n\nsense that it could have chosen earlier to move the Avitene\nproduction process out of Puerto Rico.    Had it done so, there would\n\nhave been a net job loss.    But avoiding the destruction of jobs is\n\nnot the same as creating new job opportunities, which was part of\nCongress's concern. It would seem contrary to congressional intent\n\nto create incentives for American companies to threaten the loss of\n\ncontract manufacturing jobs in Puerto Rico unless the American\n\ncompanies    were   given   the   possessions   tax   credit.    More\n\nsignificantly, M-PR's argument is too broad.      All investment, of\n\nwhatever nature, in Puerto Rico may be thought to contribute to job\n\nproducing opportunities. But Congress did not intend the credit to\n\napply whatever the nature of the investment.     Congress limited the\n\ncredit to those involved in the \"active conduct of a trade or\n\nbusiness.\"   And that does not describe what the taxpayer here did.\n\n\n                                  -38-\n\fG. Conclusion\n\n          We have no basis, in the statute or on the facts, to\n\nupset the Tax Court's reasonable conclusion that the taxpayers owe\n\nthe deficiency assessed. This case has not required us to evaluate\n\nthe Tax   Court's   proposed   rule;   each   case   will   bring   factual\n\nvariations, which bring with them legal consequences.\n\n          We affirm the judgment of the Tax Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -39-\n\f",

As part of the sale, A-PR agreed to continue manufacturing Avitene for M-PR using A-PR's own facility and labor and M-PR's recently-acquired raw materials and equipment. A-PR also used the technology acquired by M-USA. M-PR held title to the in-process and finished Avitene. A-PR shipped finished Avitene from its facility to M-USA, and title passed to M-USA, the purchaser. A-PR was solely responsible for any issues that arose until the finished product was delivered to a carrier for shipment to M-USA. In return, A-PR sent its invoices for its manufacturing services directly to M-USA, which paid, from M-PR's account, a price equal to the manufacturing cost plus 10%. The primary change effected by the 1987 sale was that certain assets were held in the name of either M-PR or its parent, M-USA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reason M-PR entered into the processing agreement with A-PR, in which A-PR manufactured Avitene for M-PR using M-PR's raw materials and equipment, was that M-PR needed to ensure a steady supply of Avitene until it built its own manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico. As it turns out, M-PR later abandoned its plan to construct its own Avitene facility in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During much of the relevant three-year period, M-PR had no employees. Its one employee, Mr. Perez, was a former A-PR employee. He worked for M-PR from March 1988 to June 1990 out of a one-room office that M-PR maintained. Mr. Perez spent much of his time planning M-PR's transition to its own Avitene manufacturing facility. M-PR also paid three independent contractors to assist Mr. Perez. M-PR treated the independent contractors as nonemployees for payroll and tax purposes. M-USA and A-PR employed the individuals, other than Mr. Perez and the independent contractors, associated with the Avitene manufacturing and sales business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the 1987 processing agreement, M-PR and M-USA had hoped to establish their own manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico. M-PR purchased land in Puerto Rico, on which it planned to build its own Avitene manufacturing facility. In early 1990 M-USA suffered financial reverses causing it to lay off a third of its workforce and to default on $10 million in debt. As a result, M-PR suspended its plans to construct a manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico. M-PR then wrote off its capital expenditures that had been made on the new facility and closed its Puerto Rico office. When the office closed, Perez transferred M-PR's business records to A-PR and M-USA. As of July 1, 1990, all M-PR checks were issued by M-USA from M-USA's Woburn, Massachusetts office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1990 M-USA decided to move the manufacturing equipment and processes from A-PR's Humacao facility to M-USA's facility in Woburn. Significant elements of the equipment were moved from Humacao to Woburn by June 1990 and, by January 1991, all of the manufacturing equipment necessary to perform the first phase of the manufacturing process had been moved to Woburn. In October 1992, first-phase Avitene production commenced in Woburn. By April 1994, M-USA had substantially completed the construction, in Woburn, of its Avitene finished goods manufacturing facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For its tax year ending August 31, 1992, M-PR claimed a tax credit under &#167; 936. The Commissioner determined that M-PR's Avitene income was not \"derived from the active conduct of a trade or business\" within a possession as &#167; 936(a)(2)(B) requires. Accordingly, the Commissioner issued a notice of deficiency in the amount of $815,196.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M-USA, as successor by merger to M-PR, contested the asserted deficiency. On June 27, 2001, the Tax Court entered its final decision, finding that M-PR was deficient, in the sum of $815,196, in its federal income tax payments. The Tax Court concluded that M-PR did not meet &#167; 936(a)(2)(B)'s \"active conduct of a trade or business within a possession\" requirement. <i>Medchem,</i> 116 T.C. at 309, 328-29.

It concluded that A-PR and M-USA (located in a mainland U.S. facility) performed, directed, and controlled all of the business activities related to the manufacture of Avitene. <i>Id.</i> at 339. The Tax Court found that, under the processing agreement, A-PR used its own personnel to manufacture, test, and package the Avitene at its Humacao facility. <i>Id.</i> at 317. A-PR employees performed all of the tasks required in the manufacturing process, including the supervision of that manufacturing. <i>Id.</i> at 317, 339. It was M-USA which distributed, marketed, and sold the drug in the United States. <i>Id.</i> at 339. Indeed, the processing agreement prohibited M-PR from taking a managerial role in the manufacturing process. <i>Id.</i> at 346. Any risks associated with M-PR's activities appear to be minimal, as M-USA had guaranteed payment of any debt, and performance of any of M-PR's obligations, arising from the asset purchase agreements. <i>Id.</i> at 316.

To the extent that M-PR is making a clear error argument with respect to the Tax Court's factual findings, we reject the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are no Treasury Department regulations interpreting &#167; 936(a),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> nor is the term \"active conduct of a trade or business\" defined for purposes of &#167; 936. There are, however, some guides to statutory interpretation, which assist us. \"It is well established in the tax law that an [IRS determination that a taxpayer owes the Federal Government a certain amount of unpaid taxes] is entitled to a legal presumption of correctness &#8212; a presumption that can help the Government prove its case against a taxpayer in court.\" <i>United States v. Fior D'Italia, Inc.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 2117, 2122, 153 L.Ed.2d 280 (2002).

Positions of the Parties</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties have presented the court with different interpretations of the meaning of &#167; 936(a). The Tax Court has, in its ruling, left each side dissatisfied. Both sides' interpretations diverge from the Tax Court's, although the government's position is much closer to the Tax Court's conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court rejected M-PR's statutory plain meaning argument. <i>Medchem,</i> 116 T.C. at 328-29. Instead, it crafted a test that, in the absence of a statutory or regulatory definition of \"active conduct of a trade or business\" for purposes of &#167; 936(a), looks to regulations defining the phrase as it is used elsewhere in the code, bearing in mind the section's legislative intent, <i>id.</i> at 330-33. Applying this test, the Tax Court rejected interpretations more helpful to the taxpayer, provided in other regulations, <i>see, e.g.,</i> 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.936-5(c) (2001). The applicable test, the Tax Court held, was whether the taxpayer \"participates regularly, continually, extensively, and actively in the management and operation of its profit-motivated activity in that possession.\" <i>Medchem,</i> 116 T.C. at 336. It held that to impute a contractor's activities to the taxpayer, the taxpayer had to \"adequately supervise[]\" the provision of these services with its own employees. <i>Id.</i> at 337. The Tax Court found the facts about M-PR's relationship with the contract manufacturer inadequate under its newly crafted test, and thus found that M-PR is not entitled to the credit. <i>Id.</i> at 337-43.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner rejects M-PR's \"plain meaning\" reading of the statute and generally rejects the proposition that use of contract manufacturers in possessions is ever sufficient to qualify for the &#167; 936(a) tax credit, but allows for rare exceptions where the taxpayer corporation is very heavily involved in the operation and management of the contract manufacturer. The Commissioner seeks affirmance of the Tax Court's result, but at oral argument protested the Tax Court's test, which is more beneficial to taxpayers than the IRS's proposed test for what constitutes the active conduct of a trade of business. The IRS proposes that outsourced manufacturing may never (well, hardly ever) qualify for the tax credit. Only in rare instances, when the taxpayer is heavily involved in the management and control of operations of a contract manufacturer, says the IRS, might it qualify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The taxpayer, M-PR, on the other hand, argues that the statute's plain meaning does not preclude tax credits to taxpayers who use contract manufacturers located in the possessions and that, if more were required, it has, on the facts, provided the requisite more. M-PR says the Tax Court is wrong in its statutory interpretation and in its choice of test. M-PR asserts that the Tax Court's test is inconsistent with regulations applicable to other parts of &#167; 936.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the denial of the credit and the finding of deficiency. In doing so, we assess and reject the taxpayer's plain meaning arguments, look to the Act's legislative history for further guidance regarding congressional intent in enacting &#167; 936, and compare the section at issue with the now-repealed Western Hemisphere Trade Corporation provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. We conclude that, on the facts presented, M-PR does not fall within the language of the statute or Congress's intent. We do so without adopting the Tax Court's proposed test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Statute and Plain Meaning</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before analyzing the statute, we think it helpful to understand the context in which the statutory interpretation question arises. \"Possessions corporations ... are U.S.-chartered companies that are effectively exempt under section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code from Federal tax on business income and qualified passive investment income from Puerto Rico and certain other U.S. possessions.\" Dep't of the Treasury, <i>The Operation and Effect of the Possessions Corporation System of Taxation, Sixth Report</i> 1 (1989) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Treasury Department has described the general operation of the possessions corporation tax system:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The possessions corporation system of taxation is a set of rules under which a U.S. corporation deriving qualifying income from possessions and Puerto Rico pays no income tax to the United States. As a U.S. corporation, a possessions corporation is subject to federal tax on its worldwide income. However, a special credit available under section 936 fully offsets the federal tax on income from a trade or business in Puerto Rico and from qualified possession source investment income (QPSII). A U.S. parent corporation can, in turn, offset dividends received from a wholly owned 936 subsidiary with a 100 percent dividends-received deduction, which frees the dividend income from federal tax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this context, we turn to the statutory language.

A separate subsection of &#167; 936 governs the tax treatment of possessions corporations' intangible property income. 26 U.S.C. &#167; 936(h). The Treasury Department has issued regulations under &#167; 936(h), <i>see</i> 26 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1.936-4 to -7 (2001), although not under &#167; 936(a). It is the &#167; 936(a) \"derived from the active conduct of a trade or business\" language that is at issue here. 26 U.S.C. &#167; 936(a)(2)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M-PR argues that &#167; 936(a) \"requires only that the taxpayer <i>derive its income</i> from an <i>active</i> business rather than a <i>passive</i> investment.\" Its argument is really two-fold: first, that \"active conduct\" means all non-passive conduct; second, that the taxpayer corporation need only derive its income from some non-passive source, meaning that the taxpayer can qualify by deriving its income from the active conduct of a third party rather than from the taxpayer's own active conduct. This interpretation, if accepted, would mean that a domestic corporation that gets its income from the sale of a pharmaceutical product manufactured by a contract manufacturer in Puerto Rico, as here, would qualify for the tax credit. We deal with each argument in turn, rejecting both parts as contrary to the text of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, M-PR's interpretation, construing income \"derived from the active conduct of a trade or business\" to mean income \"derived from an active, rather than passive, business,\" renders the statutory term \"active\" surplusage. The phrase \"active conduct of a trade or business\" does not mean that all income derived from anything that is not a passive investment qualifies for the credit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> We accept the Commissioner's view that the phrase \"conduct of a trade or business\" alone, without the term \"active,\" distinguishes section 936(a) income from passive investment income. M-PR's construction renders the term \"active\" redundant. That is not a permissible form of interpretation. <i>E.g., New England Power &amp; Marine, Inc. v. Town of Tyngsborough</i> (<i>In re Middlesex Power Equip. &amp; Marine, Inc.</i>), 292 F.3d 61, 68 (1st Cir.2002) (stating that \"[w]e assume each term was meant to have separate content in order to avoid redundancy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that the statutory term \"active\" is not surplusage, we must determine what independent meaning it adds to the statutory phrase \"active conduct.\" Because \"active\" modifies \"conduct,\" we conclude that \"active conduct\" means something more than simply a minimal level of involvement in the process of conducting a trade or business. Not all conduct of a trade or business qualifies under &#167; 936(a)(2)(B); only \"active conduct\" qualifies. Because the \"conduct of a trade or business\" itself requires some level of activity, the adjective \"active\" must, in context, signify something more than a non-zero level of activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Oxford English Dictionary's</i> first definition of the noun \"conduct\" is \"[t]he action of conducting or leading,\" and, as the term relates to a business, it is defined as \"[t]he action or manner of conducting, directing, managing, or carrying on (any business ... etc.).\" <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (2d ed.1989), http://dictionary.oed.com. Similarly, <i>Webster's</i> defines the noun \"conduct\" as \"the act, manner, or process of carrying out ... or carrying forward (as a business, government, or war).\" <i>Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged</i> 473 (P.B. Gove et al. eds. 1993). \"Active,\" in turn, is generally defined as \"[c]haracterized by action\" and is defined in terms such as \"[o]riginating or communicating action,\" \"practical,\" \"working, effective, having practical operation or results.\" <i>Oxford English Dictionary, supra; see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged, supra,</i> at 22 (defining \"active\" as \"characterized by action rather than by contemplation or speculation\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mere act, without more, of purchasing products that another unrelated entity has taken the action to manufacture, and reselling the products to others outside the possession, does not fit within the meaning of \"active conduct of a trade or business.\" In such a case, it is the unrelated entity controlling and directing the manufacturing that is actively conducting the trade or business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Tax Court was \"not even able to find that M-P.R. had any meaningful business activity in Puerto Rico.\" <i>Medchem,</i> 116 T.C. at 337. It found that M-PR's \"involvement in Puerto Rico during the 3-year period failed even to qualify as a trade or business in Puerto Rico,\" <i>id.</i> at 338, never mind as an actively conducted trade or business. It concluded that A-PR and M-USA, but not M-PR, directed and controlled \"[a]ll of the business activities connected to Avitene,\" <i>id.,</i> and that A-PR \"performed every task required in the manufacturing process,\" without the ability of M-PR \"to manage, direct, or control any part of the manufacturing process,\" <i>id.</i> at 339. These findings were not clearly erroneous. On these facts, we are confident in the conclusion that M-PR did not itself actively conduct a trade or business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining question is whether A-PR's manufacturing activities may be attributed to M-PR for the purposes of &#167; 936(a). The answer to this question hinges on M-PR's second claim, that the statutory phrase requires only that the income \"derived\" by the taxpayer be from some third party engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business. We reject this claim as well. Both the Tax Court and the Commissioner interpret &#167; 936(a) as requiring that the taxpayer, not someone else, be the entity engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, this reading is the most natural reading of the statutory requirement that at least 75% of the taxpayer's gross income during the relevant period be \"derived from the active conduct of a trade or business within a possession of the United States.\" 26 U.S.C. &#167; 936(a)(2)(B). M-PR correctly notes that Congress could have more explicitly said, \"the active conduct <i>by the taxpayer</i> of a trade or business\" and it did not. But Congress might have concluded that the addition of the phrase would be redundant, given the preceding discussion and especially given that the taxpayer corporation is the only actor referenced in &#167; 936(a)(1)-(2). Congress could also have said \"the active conduct <i>by the taxpayer or any contract manufacturer</i> of a trade or business,\" which is M-PR's reading, and it did not. Viewed myopically, the statutory phrase is silent on whose \"active conduct of a trade or business\" it refers to, but, viewed in context, the best reading is that it means the taxpayer's own active conduct. Ambiguity in this instance does not assist M-PR because a deduction or credit should be allowed only where there is \"clear provision therefor.\" <i>New Colonial Ice Co.,</i> 292 U.S. at 440, 54 S.Ct. 788. M-PR has simply not met its burden of proving entitlement to the &#167; 936 credit claimed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To read the statute as requiring only that the income be derived from a third party's active conduct would eliminate the distinction between active conduct income and all other income, including passive investment income. Virtually all passive investment income, for example, is derived, somewhere down the chain, by some entity's active conduct of a trade or business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, as discussed below, the legislative history confirms Congress's intent to require the taxpayer claiming the credit to itself be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business. If M-PR's interpretation were correct, then upon the 1976 enactment of &#167; 936, <i>see</i> Tax Reform Act of 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-455, &#167; 1051, 90 Stat. 1520, 1643-47 (1976) (current version at 26 U.S.C. &#167; 936 (2000)), all domestic corporations that had contract manufacturers in Puerto Rico (and otherwise met the numerical requirements) would automatically have become eligible for the tax credit. This is, in our view, highly improbable on its face. It is particularly improbable given the legislative history discussed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.

Section 936 in general, and the \"active conduct of a trade or business\" language in particular, have their roots in much older legislation. Before analyzing the legislative history as it pertains to the meaning of the relevant statutory phrase, we describe &#167; 936's predecessors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both &#167; 936 and the basic structure of today's possessions corporation tax system have their genesis in a provision of the Revenue Act of 1921. <i>See</i> Revenue Act of 1921, Pub.L. No. 67-98, &#167; 262, 42 Stat. 227, 271 (1921). The phrase we interpret &#8212; \"derived from the active conduct of a trade or business\" &#8212; first appeared in the Revenue Act of 1921, though in a slightly different context. <i>Compare id. with</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 936(a)(2)(B). The 1921 Act exempted a domestic corporation from federal taxes on foreign-source income if, for the three years preceding the close of the taxable year, it derived at least 80% of its gross income from sources within a possession and 50% or more of its gross income \"from the active conduct of a trade or business\" within the possessions. &#167; 262, 42 Stat. at 271. Congress enacted this section of the 1921 Act to eliminate the competitive disadvantage that U.S. corporations were suffering as a result of double taxation of income earned outside the U.S. and to encourage U.S. business investments in U.S. possessions. <i>See</i> S.Rep.

No. 83-591, &#167; 931, 68A Stat. 3, 291 (1954).

Section 936 partially replaced section 931, as it relates to Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See id.</i> The 1976 legislation effected a number of revisions in prior law. To focus on the revision central to this case, the new &#167; 936 transformed the old section 931 <i>exemption</i> mechanism into a tax <i>credit.</i> The credit permits domestic corporations to offset U.S. taxes on income \"derived from the active conduct of a trade or business\" in Puerto Rico, if certain prerequisites are met. &#167; 1051(b), 90 Stat. at 1644.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> We rely on the Treasury Department's 1989 Report, which described the transition from the 1921 Act to the 1976 Act:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The possessions corporation exemption remained unchanged until the Tax Reform Act of 1976. Many U.S. firms established plants in Puerto Rico after 1948, when Puerto Rico enacted a program of tax exemption for manufacturing firms. Before the 1976 Act was implemented, proponents of continued U.S. tax exemption argued that the possessions corporation system of taxation was needed to offset the U.S. minimum wage requirement, the requirement to use U.S. flag vessels in transporting goods to the United States, and other Federally imposed requirements that tended to reduce Puerto Rico's ability to compete with neighboring countries for U.S. investment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By enacting the Tax Reform Act of 1976, Congress wanted to leave undisturbed the tax exemption of earnings from a trade or business in Puerto Rico or from investments made with those earnings for Puerto Rican use. At the same time, Congress wished to end the exemption for passive income from funds invested in foreign capital markets and to hasten their repatriation if not used in the possession....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To continue promoting Puerto Rico's industrial development, the Tax Reform Act of 1976 therefore left intact the exemption for income derived by U.S. corporations from operations in a possession. It also exempted from tax the dividends remitted by a possessions corporation to its U.S. parent. To prevent the avoidance of tax on income invested in foreign countries by possessions corporations, however, the Tax Reform Act eliminated the exemption for income derived outside the possessions. The changes in the tax treatment of possessions corporations were effected by removing possessions corporations from section 931 of the Internal Revenue Code and placing them into a newly created Code section 936.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Operation and Effect of the Possessions Corporation System of Taxation, supra,</i> at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the problem before us, the Treasury Report described the effect of the change: <i>Change in the scope of and method of effecting the tax exemption.</i> Before 1976, a possessions corporation was exempt from U.S. tax on all income derived from sources outside the United States. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1976, the exemption was limited to two kinds of income:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#8212; Income from the active conduct of a trade or business in a possession, or from the sale or exchange of substantially all of the assets used by the corporation in the active conduct of such trade or business; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#8212; QPSII, which is non-business income derived from the possession in which the corporation has its trade or business and which is attributable to the investment of funds derived from such trade or business for use within the possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than exempting the income from U.S. taxation, section 936 provides a credit equal to (and, therefore, fully offsetting) the U.S. tax on the income. The section 936 credit is not available for other income earned by a possessions corporation. However, a regular foreign tax credit may be claimed for foreign (including possession) taxes paid or accrued with respect to income that does not qualify for the 936 credit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 7 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The House and Senate Reports are virtually identical on the pertinent provision. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep.

The congressional history reflects a dual intention to stimulate investment, both active and passive, in Puerto Rico and to encourage the growth of new jobs in Puerto Rico. H.R.Rep. No. 94-658 at 255; S.Rep. No. 94-938 at 279 (same). Those are related but not identical objectives. Congress's emphasis on the creation of new jobs by operating companies is also reflected by the fact that Congress mandated that the Department of the Treasury report to it periodically on the progress in meeting that goal. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 94-658 at 259, <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3154 (stating that the Department of the Treasury's reports are to include, among other things, \"an analysis of ... the [provision's] effects on investment and employment in the possessions\"); S.Rep. No. 94-938 at 282, <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3713 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Department of the Treasury has not promulgated regulations under &#167; 936(a), its reports provide data both on how Treasury has interpreted that section and on the context of the legislation. We look, in particular, to Treasury's 1989 Report. <i>See The Operation and Effect of the Possessions Corporation System of Taxation, supra.</i> The 1989 Report provides insight into Treasury's interpretation of &#167; 936. For example, the 1989 Report says \"[b]y enacting section 936, Congress sought to assist Puerto Rico in obtaining employment-producing investments.\" <i>Id.</i> at 3; <i>see also id.</i> at 46 (same). Accordingly, Treasury matched \"possessions corporations' U.S. income tax returns with payroll and employment data from the companies' federal unemployment insurance tax returns\" to determine \"whether this objective has been attained.\" <i>Id.</i> at 46. In particular, Treasury sought to measure the \"direct employment associated with section 936 companies.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, as of 1989, Puerto Rican business expansion had \"been concentrated in four high-technology industries: chemicals (including pharmaceuticals), scientific instruments, electrical and electronic equipment, and machinery.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27. From 1970 to 1988, the chemical industry's earned income grew from 11% to 44% of total income originating in Puerto Rican manufacturing. <i>Id.</i> Nearly all of the investments in those industries were made by possessions corporations. <i>Id.</i> at 27-29. Indeed, in 1983, about 62% of the employees in the Puerto Rican manufacturing sector were employed by possessions corporations; this represents about 12% of Puerto Rico's total employment. <i>Id.</i> at 3. As the 1989 Treasury Department Report makes clear, most of the corporations that qualified to receive the possessions tax credit were manufacturing corporations. <i>Id.</i> at 31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the whole, the views on eligibility for the tax credit expressed both in the legislative history and in the Treasury Department's Report are more consistent with those of the Commissioner and the Tax Court than those of M-PR. Those views are not binding on us, but they have some weight. Both sources tend to support the Commissioner's view that &#167; 936(a) requires that the taxpayer itself actively conduct a trade or business, with the expectation being that this active conduct by the taxpayer would increase employment and investment in Puerto Rico. Both sources contemplate that the taxpayer be the party employing workers in the Puerto Rican economy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Tax Court's conclusion, which was not clearly erroneous, was that M-PR's investment in Puerto Rico's economy was virtually nonexistent. <i>Medchem,</i> 116 T.C. at 337. M-PR's activities in Puerto Rico \"failed even to qualify as a trade or business in Puerto Rico,\" <i>id.</i> at 338, much less as an actively conducted one. A-PR and M-USA directed and controlled \"[a]ll of the business activities connected to Avitene.\" <i>Id.</i> Furthermore, during the relevant three-year period, M-PR placed only one employee in Puerto Rico. That employee, Mr. Perez, worked for M-PR out of a one-room office for less than one year of the requisite three-year period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Western Hemisphere Trade Corporations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M-PR urges that we follow the construction that some courts have given to the phrase \"active conduct of a trade or business\" under the Western Hemisphere Trade Corporation (\"WHTC\") provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, &#167; 921, 68A Stat. at 290, that were repealed in 1976. Section 921 defined \"Western Hemisphere trade corporation\" to mean \"a domestic corporation all of whose business... is done in any ... countries in North, Central, or South America, or in the West Indies, and which satisfies\" two requirements. <i>Id.</i> One requirement was that at least 95% of the corporation's gross income for the three preceding years be derived from sources outside of the United States. <i>Id.</i> The other was that at least 90% of the corporation's gross income for the three preceding years be \"derived from the active conduct of a trade or business.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although at first cut the WHTC provision appears to be an apt point of comparison, ultimately this analogy does not assist M-PR. This is primarily because of the important differences between the purposes of the WHTC provision and &#167; 936.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress may, particularly in the internal revenue code, use the same phrase, such as \"active conduct of a trade or business,\" in attempts to reach different ends. The Supreme Court made this point in <i>Commissioner v. Groetzinger,</i> 480 U.S. 23, 107 S.Ct. 980, 94 L.Ed.2d 25 (1987). After noting that the phrase \"trade or business\" appeared in over fifty sections of the Code, the Court stated: \"[I]n this opinion our interpretation of the phrase `trade or business' is confined to the specific sections of the Code at issue here. We do not purport to construe the phrase where it appears in other places.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27 &amp; n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 980. Other circuits construing the phrase \"trade or business\" have also concluded that the phrase has different meanings in different sections of the Internal Revenue Code. In <i>Hughes v. Commissioner,</i> 38 F.2d 755 (10th Cir.1930), for example, the Tenth Circuit, construing the statutory phrase \"trade or business\" in section 204(a) of the Revenue Act of 1921, Pub.L. No. 67-98, &#167; 204(a), 42 Stat. 227, 231 (1921), stated that \"[w]e are here concerned only with the meaning of this phrase as used in this section. The same phrase, in other statutes, or in other sections, in a different context, and for a different purpose, may or may not be helpful.\" <i>Hughes,</i> 38 F.2d at 757. This is not to say that the WHTC provision is necessarily inapposite, but rather simply to emphasize, as we have emphasized in other contexts, that \"the same words may play different roles in different contexts.\" <i>Walker v. Exeter,</i> 284 F.3d 42, 45 n. 4 (1st Cir.2002). The relevance of the WHTC provision, then, turns on its similarity to the provision at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court has described the legislative history of the WHTC provision as disclosing a congressional \"desire to offset through a tax preference the competitive disadvantage suffered by certain American corporations abroad on account of the less onerous taxes to which their non-American competitors were subject.\" <i>Kewanee Oil Co. v. Comm'r,</i> 62 T.C. 728, 737, 1974 WL 2688 (1974). Accordingly,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[i]t follows that when the \"active conduct\" requirement is read in the context from which it arose, namely the threat of foreign competition, one might well conclude that in passing the Western Hemisphere provisions Congress intended to grant relief to United States business activity in the Americas only to the extent that the beneficiary corporation conducted active business operations abroad vulnerable to the competitive threat posed by the tax-advantaged corporations of other countries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 737-38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the WHTC provision, the possessions tax credit was meant to offset the competitive disadvantage suffered by American companies. The possessions tax credit, however, was meant not only to offset certain impediments for U.S. corporations investing in Puerto Rico, but also to increase investment and employment-producing opportunities in Puerto Rico. This is a difference that makes a difference. To the extent that the WHTC provision was meant to increase the foreign competitiveness of domestic corporations, the geographic location of those corporations' operations was relevant only to a limited extent &#8212; that is, it was important only to ensure that the domestic corporation actually engaged in some foreign commerce. In contrast, the possessions tax credit was meant, in addition to advancing the competitiveness of domestic corporations, to stimulate investment in particular places, including Puerto Rico. On this account, unlike the WHTC provision, the location of the corporation's trade or business was critical to advancing this goal. After all, the goal is promoting investment in the possessions &#8212; a goal the attainment of which is intrinsically tied to the location of the investments made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M-PR relies on <i>Frank v. International Canadian Corp.,</i> 308 F.2d 520 (9th Cir. 1962), a Ninth Circuit decision applying the WHTC provision of section 109 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. It is far from clear that this court would have viewed <i>Frank</i>'s facts the same way and reached the same outcome as did the Ninth Circuit, even under the WHTC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Frank,</i> the Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Corporation of Washington, a domestic corporation that regularly conducted business activities in British Columbia, decided to assume new shipping responsibilities. <i>Id.</i> at 522-23. For legitimate business reasons having to do with the most favored nation clauses in its contracts and the Robinson-Patman Act's prohibitions, Washington decided to form a new corporation, named International Canadian Corporation, as a WHTC, in order to perform the shipping. <i>Id.</i> International, in turn, had one full-time employee and assumed the parent's sales functions. <i>Id.</i> International did utilize services of Washington's employees and paid for those services. <i>Id.</i> at 523. The Ninth Circuit held, on review of a district court decision, that International, which came into existence for legitimate business reasons unrelated to the WHTC provision, was not disqualified from the WHTC credit although it had assumed former business of Washington, utilized and paid for help from Washington's employees, and did not have a source of supply or customers independent of Washington's. <i>Id.</i> at 526-27. The court found that International clearly was active, earning its income by performing a variety of services relating to the sale of chemical products. <i>Id.</i> at 525-27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ninth Circuit's opinion is of limited utility because of the factual distinctions between it and the case here. For example, <i>Frank</i> found that International's existence was justified by a legitimate business purpose. <i>Id.</i> at 526. At least from early 1990, when M-USA had decided not to build a manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico, it is difficult to view M-PR as anything other than a corporate shell with little business reason to exist other than to attempt to secure the &#167; 936 credit. Furthermore, as already discussed, the divergent policy goals of the possessions tax credit and the WHTC provision mean that the analogy is strained from the start. Nothing in the history of the WHTC leads us to the taxpayer's interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Analogy to Other Regulatory Definitions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court found twenty-two uses of the phrase \"active conduct of a trade or business\" in the Internal Revenue Code. <i>Medchem,</i> 116 T.C. at 330 &amp; n. 13. M-PR argues that the Tax Court erred in looking by analogy to regulations interpreting \"active conduct of a trade or business\" as used in 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 179, 355, and 367, for purposes of interpreting the phrase as used in &#167; 936.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The argument is that the purposes of those sections are so different from the purpose of &#167; 936 that their selection was arbitrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not think the selection was arbitrary. We analyze one example to demonstrate our point. M-PR says the regulation under &#167; 179 is not analogous because that regulation is explicit: it refers to a trade or business \"actively conducted <i>by the taxpayer.</i>\" 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.179-2(c)(6) (2001) (emphasis added). It states, in part, that \"a taxpayer generally is considered to actively conduct a trade or business if the taxpayer meaningfully participates in the management or operations of the trade or business. A mere passive investor in a trade or business does not actively conduct the trade or business.\" <i>Id.</i> As stated earlier, our view is that the \"by the taxpayer\" requirement is implicit in &#167; 936, and so the analogy to 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.179-2(c)(6) is not strained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M-PR argues that the more appropriate analogy is to 26 U.S.C. &#167; 936(h)(5), and guidance provided thereunder, which, M-PR says, contemplates the use of contract manufacturers. That section states, in relevant part, that an electing corporation shall not be treated as having a significant business presence in a possession with respect to a product produced in whole or in part by the electing corporation in the possession... unless such product is manufactured or produced in the possession by the electing corporation within the meaning of subsection (d)(1)(A) of section 954.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">26 U.S.C. &#167; 936(h)(5). Section 954(d)(1)(A) states that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the term \"foreign base company sales income\" means income ... derived in connection with the purchase of personal property from a related person and its sale to any person, the sale of personal property to any person on behalf of a related person, the purchase of personal property from any person and its sale to a related person, or the purchase of personal property from any person on behalf of a related person where &#8212; (A) the property which is purchased (or in the case of property sold on behalf of a related person, the property which is sold) is manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted outside the country under the laws of which the controlled foreign corporation is created or organized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">26 U.S.C. &#167; 954(d)(1) (2000). M-PR says that it relied on a Revenue Ruling concluding that, under &#167; 954, when a \"controlled foreign corporation\" contracts out a manufacturing process to another manufacturer, the contract manufacturer's performance is considered to be performance by the controlled foreign corporation. <i>See</i> Rev. Rul. 75-7, 1975-1 C.B. 244, 1975 WL 34793. M-PR says &#167; 936(a)(2) must be read, in light of Revenue Ruling 75-7, not to require the taxpayer actually to supervise the contract manufacturer's activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two sections, however, measure different things. As the Commissioner points out, the Revenue Ruling allows contract manufacturing to be taken into account in narrow situations, not present here. Section 936(h)(1) taxes \"intangible property income\" to the U.S. shareholder of the &#167; 936 corporation unless the &#167; 936 corporation elects either the cost sharing or profit split method. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 936(h)(5)(C). To make that election, the &#167; 936 corporation must have a \"significant business presence\" (\"SBP\") in the possession as to that product or service. In order to show a \"significant business presence\" certain numerical tests must be met and, in addition, the product must be manufactured or produced in the possession within the meaning of &#167; 954(d)(1)(A). For these stated purposes, contract manufacturing costs may be attributed to the taxpayer as allowed by the regulations. Those regulations, <i>for purposes of the SBP requirement,</i> permit a possessions corporation to treat the cost of contract manufacturing as a cost of direct labor. <i>See</i> 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.936-5(c). The purpose appears to be to permit a taxpayer who <i>has already satisfied</i> the 75% \"active conduct of a trade or business\" requirement <i>then</i> to obtain &#167; 936 credit for the contract manufactured product. We reject the argument that the section 936(h)(5) provisions govern by analogy the initial question of what is meant by the active conduct of a trade or business.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F. Application of Section 936(a) to the Facts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under our understanding of the statutory term, the requisite gross income of M-PR, over the relevant three-year time period, was not \"derived from the active conduct of a trade or business within a possession of the United States.\" 26 U.S.C. &#167; 936(a)(2)(B). This is because M-PR was not engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business in Puerto Rico for the three preceding years. The Tax Court was \"not even able to find that MedChem P.R. had any meaningful business activity in Puerto Rico.\" <i>Medchem,</i> 116 T.C. at 337. We agree that, whatever M-PR's presence in Puerto Rico, over the relevant time-period, it did not actively conduct a trade or business there. A-PR and M-USA, but not M-PR, directed and controlled all of the Avitene business activities. A-PR performed the tasks required in the manufacturing process, without the ability of M-PR to control any part of that process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During much of the relevant three-year period, M-PR had no employees. Its one employee, Mr. Perez, was a former A-PR employee who worked out of a one-room office maintained by M-PR. He worked for M-PR from March 1988 to June 1990, though only about ten months of his employment occurred during the relevant three-year period. M-PR argues that, for other reasons, A-PR activities must be attributed to M-PR, and that A-PR employees are M-PR's employees. The Tax Court adopted as its definition of an employee of M-PR the definition used by the IRS to determine if an individual is an employee for payroll tax and withholding purposes. <i>See Medchem,</i> 116 T.C. at 341-43 (citing 26 C.F.R. &#167; 31.3401(c)-1(b) (stating, among other things, that \"if an individual is subject to the control or direction of another merely as to the result to be accomplished by the work and not as to the means and methods for accomplishing the result, he is not an employee\")). Under that approach, neither A-PR nor the contract employees meet the test. Nor do those M-USA employees who served as M-PR officers but received no compensation from M-PR. We think the Tax Court's approach was correct because we agree that none of the purported M-PR employees were subject to M-PR's control as to the means and methods of carrying out the production and sale of Avitene. Even were this not the case, we also think it significant that, until this litigation, M-PR consistently treated these individuals as nonemployees for tax purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, M-PR makes a policy argument that it should be within the scope of the tax credit because it created jobs in the sense that it could have chosen earlier to move the Avitene production process out of Puerto Rico. Had it done so, there would have been a net job loss. But avoiding the destruction of jobs is not the same as creating new job opportunities, which was part of Congress's concern. It would seem contrary to congressional intent to create incentives for American companies to threaten the loss of contract manufacturing jobs in Puerto Rico unless the American companies were given the possessions tax credit. More significantly, M-PR's argument is too broad. All investment, of whatever nature, in Puerto Rico may be thought to contribute to job producing opportunities. But Congress did not intend the credit to apply whatever the nature of the investment. Congress limited the credit to those involved in the \"active conduct of a trade or business.\" And that does not describe what the taxpayer here did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">G. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no basis, in the statute or on the facts, to upset the Tax Court's reasonable conclusion that the taxpayers owe the deficiency assessed.

M-PR was incorporated in Delaware on December 8, 1987, as MedChem Puerto Rico, Inc. A couple of weeks later, on December 22, MedChem Puerto Rico, Inc. changed its name to BioChem Products, Inc. Then, on March 1, 1992, BioChem Products, Inc. changed its state of incorporation to Massachusetts and, on November 25, 1992, changed its name to MedChem P.R., Inc. M-PR and all of its predecessors &#8212; all of which we will refer to as M-PR &#8212; were at all times wholly owned subsidiaries of MedChem Products, Inc. (\"M-USA\"). M-USA is a Massachusetts corporation with its principal place of business in Woburn, Massachusetts. Following the tax years at issue in this case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> M-USA succeeded M-PR through a merger of M-PR into M-USA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS found a deficiency of $815,196<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> in M-PR's federal income tax paid for the tax year ending August 31, 1992, and a deficiency of $1,705,019 in M-USA's tax payments for the same period. In consolidated cases in the Tax Court, M-USA, as successor by merger to M-PR, contested both of these claims of deficiency. <i>Medchem,</i> 116 T.C. at 309. It is the $815,196 liability that is at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the relevant three-year period &#8212; that is, during each of M-PR's taxable years ending on August 31, 1990-92 &#8212; all of M-PR's reported income was \"intangible property income,\" <i>see</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 936(h)(3), attributable to the sale of Avitene, a blood-clotting drug manufactured by Alcon Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"A-PR\"), an unrelated company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 18, 1987, ten days after M-PR was incorporated, A-PR along with Alcon Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. and Alcon Laboratories, Inc. (collectively \"Alcon entities\") sold the Avitene portion of their business to M-PR and M-USA. The Alcon entities sold the equipment, raw materials, technology, and other assets associated with Avitene's manufacturing. M-USA acquired the receivables, non-competition agreements, goodwill, contract rights, records, patents and related know-how, trademarks, and Food and Drug Administration approvals. M-PR acquired receivables, inventory, and title to the machinery and equipment located within A-PR's manufacturing facility in Humacao, Puerto Rico. Those assets did not include A-PR's Avitene manufacturing facility in Humacao.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the acquisition, A-PR had been the manufacturer of Avitene. M-USA had nothing to do with the drug. Until ten days prior to the acquisition, M-PR did not exist. As part of the sale, A-PR agreed to continue manufacturing Avitene for M-PR using A-PR's own facility and labor and M-PR's recently-acquired raw materials and equipment. A-PR also used the technology acquired by M-USA. M-PR held title to the in-process and finished Avitene. A-PR shipped finished Avitene from its facility to M-USA, and title passed to M-USA, the purchaser. A-PR was solely responsible for any issues that arose until the finished product was delivered to a carrier for shipment to M-USA. In return, A-PR sent its invoices for its manufacturing services directly to M-USA, which paid, from M-PR's account, a price equal to the manufacturing cost plus 10%. The primary change effected by the 1987 sale was that certain assets were held in the name of either M-PR or its parent, M-USA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reason M-PR entered into the processing agreement with A-PR, in which A-PR manufactured Avitene for M-PR using M-PR's raw materials and equipment, was that M-PR needed to ensure a steady supply of Avitene until it built its own manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico. As it turns out, M-PR later abandoned its plan to construct its own Avitene facility in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During much of the relevant three-year period, M-PR had no employees. Its one employee, Mr. Perez, was a former A-PR employee. He worked for M-PR from March 1988 to June 1990 out of a one-room office that M-PR maintained. Mr. Perez spent much of his time planning M-PR's transition to its own Avitene manufacturing facility. M-PR also paid three independent contractors to assist Mr. Perez. M-PR treated the independent contractors as nonemployees for payroll and tax purposes. M-USA and A-PR employed the individuals, other than Mr. Perez and the independent contractors, associated with the Avitene manufacturing and sales business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the 1987 processing agreement, M-PR and M-USA had hoped to establish their own manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico. M-PR purchased land in Puerto Rico, on which it planned to build its own Avitene manufacturing facility. In early 1990 M-USA suffered financial reverses causing it to lay off a third of its workforce and to default on $10 million in debt. As a result, M-PR suspended its plans to construct a manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico. M-PR then wrote off its capital expenditures that had been made on the new facility and closed its Puerto Rico office. When the office closed, Perez transferred M-PR's business records to A-PR and M-USA. As of July 1, 1990, all M-PR checks were issued by M-USA from M-USA's Woburn, Massachusetts office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1990 M-USA decided to move the manufacturing equipment and processes from A-PR's Humacao facility to M-USA's facility in Woburn. Significant elements of the equipment were moved from Humacao to Woburn by June 1990 and, by January 1991, all of the manufacturing equipment necessary to perform the first phase of the manufacturing process had been moved to Woburn. In October 1992, first-phase Avitene production commenced in Woburn. By April 1994, M-USA had substantially completed the construction, in Woburn, of its Avitene finished goods manufacturing facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For its tax year ending August 31, 1992, M-PR claimed a tax credit under &#167; 936. The Commissioner determined that M-PR's Avitene income was not \"derived from the active conduct of a trade or business\" within a possession as &#167; 936(a)(2)(B) requires. Accordingly, the Commissioner issued a notice of deficiency in the amount of $815,196.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M-USA, as successor by merger to M-PR, contested the asserted deficiency. On June 27, 2001, the Tax Court entered its final decision, finding that M-PR was deficient, in the sum of $815,196, in its federal income tax payments. The Tax Court concluded that M-PR did not meet &#167; 936(a)(2)(B)'s \"active conduct of a trade or business within a possession\" requirement. <i>Medchem,</i> 116 T.C. at 309, 328-29. The Tax Court held that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">for purposes of section 936(a), a taxpayer actively conducts a trade or business in a U.S. possession only if it participates regularly, continually, extensively, and actively in the management and operation of its profit-motivated activity in that possession.... [F]or the purpose of this participation requirement, the services underlying a manufacturing contract may be imputed to a taxpayer only to the extent that the performance of those services is adequately supervised by the taxpayers's own employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 336-37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court concluded that M-PR did not meet this test. <i>Id.</i> at 337. It concluded that A-PR and M-USA (located in a mainland U.S. facility) performed, directed, and controlled all of the business activities related to the manufacture of Avitene. <i>Id.</i> at 339. The Tax Court found that, under the processing agreement, A-PR used its own personnel to manufacture, test, and package the Avitene at its Humacao facility. <i>Id.</i> at 317. A-PR employees performed all of the tasks required in the manufacturing process, including the supervision of that manufacturing. <i>Id.</i> at 317, 339. It was M-USA which distributed, marketed, and sold the drug in the United States. <i>Id.</i> at 339. Indeed, the processing agreement prohibited M-PR from taking a managerial role in the manufacturing process. <i>Id.</i> at 346. Any risks associated with M-PR's activities appear to be minimal, as M-USA had guaranteed payment of any debt, and performance of any of M-PR's obligations, arising from the asset purchase agreements. <i>Id.</i> at 316. M-USA consistently reported, including to the FDA and to the SEC, that the unrelated entity, A-PR, was the drug's manufacturer. <i>Id.</i> This information was also contained on the labels of the drugs. <i>Id.</i> at 315-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M-PR appeals the Tax Court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Positions of the Parties</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties have presented the court with different interpretations of the meaning of &#167; 936(a). The Tax Court has, in its ruling, left each side dissatisfied. Both sides' interpretations diverge from the Tax Court's, although the government's position is much closer to the Tax Court's conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court rejected M-PR's statutory plain meaning argument. <i>Medchem,</i> 116 T.C. at 328-29. Instead, it crafted a test that, in the absence of a statutory or regulatory definition of \"active conduct of a trade or business\" for purposes of &#167; 936(a), looks to regulations defining the phrase as it is used elsewhere in the code, bearing in mind the section's legislative intent, <i>id.</i> at 330-33. Applying this test, the Tax Court rejected interpretations more helpful to the taxpayer, provided in other regulations, <i>see, e.g.,</i> 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.936-5(c) (2001). The applicable test, the Tax Court held, was whether the taxpayer \"participates regularly, continually, extensively, and actively in the management and operation of its profit-motivated activity in that possession.\" <i>Medchem,</i> 116 T.C. at 336. It held that to impute a contractor's activities to the taxpayer, the taxpayer had to \"adequately supervise[]\" the provision of these services with its own employees. <i>Id.</i> at 337. The Tax Court found the facts about M-PR's relationship with the contract manufacturer inadequate under its newly crafted test, and thus found that M-PR is not entitled to the credit. <i>Id.</i> at 337-43.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner rejects M-PR's \"plain meaning\" reading of the statute and generally rejects the proposition that use of contract manufacturers in possessions is ever sufficient to qualify for the &#167; 936(a) tax credit, but allows for rare exceptions where the taxpayer corporation is very heavily involved in the operation and management of the contract manufacturer. The Commissioner seeks affirmance of the Tax Court's result, but at oral argument protested the Tax Court's test, which is more beneficial to taxpayers than the IRS's proposed test for what constitutes the active conduct of a trade of business. The IRS proposes that outsourced manufacturing may never (well, hardly ever) qualify for the tax credit. Only in rare instances, when the taxpayer is heavily involved in the management and control of operations of a contract manufacturer, says the IRS, might it qualify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The taxpayer, M-PR, on the other hand, argues that the statute's plain meaning does not preclude tax credits to taxpayers who use contract manufacturers located in the possessions and that, if more were required, it has, on the facts, provided the requisite more. M-PR says the Tax Court is wrong in its statutory interpretation and in its choice of test. M-PR asserts that the Tax Court's test is inconsistent with regulations applicable to other parts of &#167; 936.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the denial of the credit and the finding of deficiency. In doing so, we assess and reject the taxpayer's plain meaning arguments, look to the Act's legislative history for further guidance regarding congressional intent in enacting &#167; 936, and compare the section at issue with the now-repealed Western Hemisphere Trade Corporation provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. We conclude that, on the facts presented, M-PR does not fall within the language of the statute or Congress's intent.

The Statute and Plain Meaning</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before analyzing the statute, we think it helpful to understand the context in which the statutory interpretation question arises. \"Possessions corporations ... are U.S.-chartered companies that are effectively exempt under section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code from Federal tax on business income and qualified passive investment income from Puerto Rico and certain other U.S. possessions.\" Dep't of the Treasury, <i>The Operation and Effect of the Possessions Corporation System of Taxation, Sixth Report</i> 1 (1989) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Treasury Department has described the general operation of the possessions corporation tax system:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The possessions corporation system of taxation is a set of rules under which a U.S. corporation deriving qualifying income from possessions and Puerto Rico pays no income tax to the United States. As a U.S. corporation, a possessions corporation is subject to federal tax on its worldwide income. However, a special credit available under section 936 fully offsets the federal tax on income from a trade or business in Puerto Rico and from qualified possession source investment income (QPSII).

A separate subsection of &#167; 936 governs the tax treatment of possessions corporations' intangible property income. 26 U.S.C. &#167; 936(h). The Treasury Department has issued regulations under &#167; 936(h), <i>see</i> 26 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1.936-4 to -7 (2001), although not under &#167; 936(a). It is the &#167; 936(a) \"derived from the active conduct of a trade or business\" language that is at issue here. 26 U.S.C. &#167; 936(a)(2)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M-PR argues that &#167; 936(a) \"requires only that the taxpayer <i>derive its income</i> from an <i>active</i> business rather than a <i>passive</i> investment.\" Its argument is really two-fold: first, that \"active conduct\" means all non-passive conduct; second, that the taxpayer corporation need only derive its income from some non-passive source, meaning that the taxpayer can qualify by deriving its income from the active conduct of a third party rather than from the taxpayer's own active conduct. This interpretation, if accepted, would mean that a domestic corporation that gets its income from the sale of a pharmaceutical product manufactured by a contract manufacturer in Puerto Rico, as here, would qualify for the tax credit. We deal with each argument in turn, rejecting both parts as contrary to the text of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, M-PR's interpretation, construing income \"derived from the active conduct of a trade or business\" to mean income \"derived from an active, rather than passive, business,\" renders the statutory term \"active\" surplusage. The phrase \"active conduct of a trade or business\" does not mean that all income derived from anything that is not a passive investment qualifies for the credit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> We accept the Commissioner's view that the phrase \"conduct of a trade or business\" alone, without the term \"active,\" distinguishes section 936(a) income from passive investment income. M-PR's construction renders the term \"active\" redundant. That is not a permissible form of interpretation. <i>E.g., New England Power &amp; Marine, Inc. v. Town of Tyngsborough</i> (<i>In re Middlesex Power Equip. &amp; Marine, Inc.</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199996\"><a href=\"/opinion/199996/in-re-middlesex-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 68 (1st Cir.2002) (stating that \"[w]e assume each term was meant to have separate content in order to avoid redundancy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that the statutory term \"active\" is not surplusage, we must determine what independent meaning it adds to the statutory phrase \"active conduct.\" Because \"active\" modifies \"conduct,\" we conclude that \"active conduct\" means something more than simply a minimal level of involvement in the process of conducting a trade or business. Not all conduct of a trade or business qualifies under &#167; 936(a)(2)(B); only \"active conduct\" qualifies. Because the \"conduct of a trade or business\" itself requires some level of activity, the adjective \"active\" must, in context, signify something more than a non-zero level of activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Oxford English Dictionary's</i> first definition of the noun \"conduct\" is \"[t]he action of conducting or leading,\" and, as the term relates to a business, it is defined as \"[t]he action or manner of conducting, directing, managing, or carrying on (any business ... etc.).\" <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (2d ed.1989), http://dictionary.oed.com. Similarly, <i>Webster's</i> defines the noun \"conduct\" as \"the act, manner, or process of carrying out ... or carrying forward (as a business, government, or war).\" <i>Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged</i> 473 (P.B. Gove et al. eds. 1993). \"Active,\" in turn, is generally defined as \"[c]haracterized by action\" and is defined in terms such as \"[o]riginating or communicating action,\" \"practical,\" \"working, effective, having practical operation or results.\" <i>Oxford English Dictionary, supra; see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged, supra,</i> at 22 (defining \"active\" as \"characterized by action rather than by contemplation or speculation\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mere act, without more, of purchasing products that another unrelated entity has taken the action to manufacture, and reselling the products to others outside the possession, does not fit within the meaning of \"active conduct of a trade or business.\" In such a case, it is the unrelated entity controlling and directing the manufacturing that is actively conducting the trade or business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Tax Court was \"not even able to find that M-P.R. had any meaningful business activity in Puerto Rico.\" <i>Medchem,</i> 116 T.C. at 337. It found that M-PR's \"involvement in Puerto Rico during the 3-year period failed even to qualify as a trade or business in Puerto Rico,\" <i>id.</i> at 338, never mind as an actively conducted trade or business. It concluded that A-PR and M-USA, but not M-PR, directed and controlled \"[a]ll of the business activities connected to Avitene,\" <i>id.,</i> and that A-PR \"performed every task required in the manufacturing process,\" without the ability of M-PR \"to manage, direct, or control any part of the manufacturing process,\" <i>id.</i> at 339. These findings were not clearly erroneous. On these facts, we are confident in the conclusion that M-PR did not itself actively conduct a trade or business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining question is whether A-PR's manufacturing activities may be attributed to M-PR for the purposes of &#167; 936(a). The answer to this question hinges on M-PR's second claim, that the statutory phrase requires only that the income \"derived\" by the taxpayer be from some third party engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business. We reject this claim as well. Both the Tax Court and the Commissioner interpret &#167; 936(a) as requiring that the taxpayer, not someone else, be the entity engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, this reading is the most natural reading of the statutory requirement that at least 75% of the taxpayer's gross income during the relevant period be \"derived from the active conduct of a trade or business within a possession of the United States.\" 26 U.S.C. &#167; 936(a)(2)(B). M-PR correctly notes that Congress could have more explicitly said, \"the active conduct <i>by the taxpayer</i> of a trade or business\" and it did not. But Congress might have concluded that the addition of the phrase would be redundant, given the preceding discussion and especially given that the taxpayer corporation is the only actor referenced in &#167; 936(a)(1)-(2). Congress could also have said \"the active conduct <i>by the taxpayer or any contract manufacturer</i> of a trade or business,\" which is M-PR's reading, and it did not. Viewed myopically, the statutory phrase is silent on whose \"active conduct of a trade or business\" it refers to, but, viewed in context, the best reading is that it means the taxpayer's own active conduct. Ambiguity in this instance does not assist M-PR because a deduction or credit should be allowed only where there is \"clear provision therefor.\" <i>New Colonial Ice Co.,</i> 292 U.S. at 440, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></span>. M-PR has simply not met its burden of proving entitlement to the &#167; 936 credit claimed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To read the statute as requiring only that the income be derived from a third party's active conduct would eliminate the distinction between active conduct income and all other income, including passive investment income. Virtually all passive investment income, for example, is derived, somewhere down the chain, by some entity's active conduct of a trade or business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, as discussed below, the legislative history confirms Congress's intent to require the taxpayer claiming the credit to itself be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business. If M-PR's interpretation were correct, then upon the 1976 enactment of &#167; 936, <i>see</i> Tax Reform Act of 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-455, &#167; 1051, 90 Stat. 1520, 1643-47 (1976) (current version at 26 U.S.C. &#167; 936 (2000)), all domestic corporations that had contract manufacturers in Puerto Rico (and otherwise met the numerical requirements) would automatically have become eligible for the tax credit. This is, in our view, highly improbable on its face. It is particularly improbable given the legislative history discussed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.

Section 936 in general, and the \"active conduct of a trade or business\" language in particular, have their roots in much older legislation. Before analyzing the legislative history as it pertains to the meaning of the relevant statutory phrase, we describe &#167; 936's predecessors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both &#167; 936 and the basic structure of today's possessions corporation tax system have their genesis in a provision of the Revenue Act of 1921. <i>See</i> Revenue Act of 1921, Pub.L. No. 67-98, &#167; 262, 42 Stat. 227, 271 (1921). The phrase we interpret &#8212; \"derived from the active conduct of a trade or business\" &#8212; first appeared in the Revenue Act of 1921, though in a slightly different context. <i>Compare id. with</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 936(a)(2)(B). The 1921 Act exempted a domestic corporation from federal taxes on foreign-source income if, for the three years preceding the close of the taxable year, it derived at least 80% of its gross income from sources within a possession and 50% or more of its gross income \"from the active conduct of a trade or business\" within the possessions. &#167; 262, 42 Stat. at 271. Congress enacted this section of the 1921 Act to eliminate the competitive disadvantage that U.S. corporations were suffering as a result of double taxation of income earned outside the U.S. and to encourage U.S. business investments in U.S. possessions. <i>See</i> S.Rep.

Many U.S. firms established plants in Puerto Rico after 1948, when Puerto Rico enacted a program of tax exemption for manufacturing firms. Before the 1976 Act was implemented, proponents of continued U.S. tax exemption argued that the possessions corporation system of taxation was needed to offset the U.S. minimum wage requirement, the requirement to use U.S. flag vessels in transporting goods to the United States, and other Federally imposed requirements that tended to reduce Puerto Rico's ability to compete with neighboring countries for U.S. investment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By enacting the Tax Reform Act of 1976, Congress wanted to leave undisturbed the tax exemption of earnings from a trade or business in Puerto Rico or from investments made with those earnings for Puerto Rican use.

It also exempted from tax the dividends remitted by a possessions corporation to its U.S. parent. To prevent the avoidance of tax on income invested in foreign countries by possessions corporations, however, the Tax Reform Act eliminated the exemption for income derived outside the possessions. The changes in the tax treatment of possessions corporations were effected by removing possessions corporations from section 931 of the Internal Revenue Code and placing them into a newly created Code section 936.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Operation and Effect of the Possessions Corporation System of Taxation, supra,</i> at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the problem before us, the Treasury Report described the effect of the change: <i>Change in the scope of and method of effecting the tax exemption.</i> Before 1976, a possessions corporation was exempt from U.S. tax on all income derived from sources outside the United States. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1976, the exemption was limited to two kinds of income:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#8212; Income from the active conduct of a trade or business in a possession, or from the sale or exchange of substantially all of the assets used by the corporation in the active conduct of such trade or business; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#8212; QPSII, which is non-business income derived from the possession in which the corporation has its trade or business and which is attributable to the investment of funds derived from such trade or business for use within the possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than exempting the income from U.S. taxation, section 936 provides a credit equal to (and, therefore, fully offsetting) the U.S. tax on the income. The section 936 credit is not available for other income earned by a possessions corporation.

No. 94-658 at 255, <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3151; <i>see also</i> S.Rep. No. 94-938 at 279, <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3710 (using the same language). The congressional history reflects a dual intention to stimulate investment, both active and passive, in Puerto Rico and to encourage the growth of new jobs in Puerto Rico. H.R.Rep. No. 94-658 at 255; S.Rep. No. 94-938 at 279 (same). Those are related but not identical objectives. Congress's emphasis on the creation of new jobs by operating companies is also reflected by the fact that Congress mandated that the Department of the Treasury report to it periodically on the progress in meeting that goal. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 94-658 at 259, <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3154 (stating that the Department of the Treasury's reports are to include, among other things, \"an analysis of ... the [provision's] effects on investment and employment in the possessions\"); S.Rep. No. 94-938 at 282, <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3713 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Department of the Treasury has not promulgated regulations under &#167; 936(a), its reports provide data both on how Treasury has interpreted that section and on the context of the legislation. We look, in particular, to Treasury's 1989 Report. <i>See The Operation and Effect of the Possessions Corporation System of Taxation, supra.</i> The 1989 Report provides insight into Treasury's interpretation of &#167; 936. For example, the 1989 Report says \"[b]y enacting section 936, Congress sought to assist Puerto Rico in obtaining employment-producing investments.\" <i>Id.</i> at 3; <i>see also id.</i> at 46 (same). Accordingly, Treasury matched \"possessions corporations' U.S. income tax returns with payroll and employment data from the companies' federal unemployment insurance tax returns\" to determine \"whether this objective has been attained.\" <i>Id.</i> at 46. In particular, Treasury sought to measure the \"direct employment associated with section 936 companies.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, as of 1989, Puerto Rican business expansion had \"been concentrated in four high-technology industries: chemicals (including pharmaceuticals), scientific instruments, electrical and electronic equipment, and machinery.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27. From 1970 to 1988, the chemical industry's earned income grew from 11% to 44% of total income originating in Puerto Rican manufacturing. <i>Id.</i> Nearly all of the investments in those industries were made by possessions corporations. <i>Id.</i> at 27-29. Indeed, in 1983, about 62% of the employees in the Puerto Rican manufacturing sector were employed by possessions corporations; this represents about 12% of Puerto Rico's total employment. <i>Id.</i> at 3. As the 1989 Treasury Department Report makes clear, most of the corporations that qualified to receive the possessions tax credit were manufacturing corporations. <i>Id.</i> at 31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the whole, the views on eligibility for the tax credit expressed both in the legislative history and in the Treasury Department's Report are more consistent with those of the Commissioner and the Tax Court than those of M-PR. Those views are not binding on us, but they have some weight. Both sources tend to support the Commissioner's view that &#167; 936(a) requires that the taxpayer itself actively conduct a trade or business, with the expectation being that this active conduct by the taxpayer would increase employment and investment in Puerto Rico. Both sources contemplate that the taxpayer be the party employing workers in the Puerto Rican economy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Tax Court's conclusion, which was not clearly erroneous, was that M-PR's investment in Puerto Rico's economy was virtually nonexistent. <i>Medchem,</i> 116 T.C. at 337. M-PR's activities in Puerto Rico \"failed even to qualify as a trade or business in Puerto Rico,\" <i>id.</i> at 338, much less as an actively conducted one. A-PR and M-USA directed and controlled \"[a]ll of the business activities connected to Avitene.\" <i>Id.</i> Furthermore, during the relevant three-year period, M-PR placed only one employee in Puerto Rico. That employee, Mr. Perez, worked for M-PR out of a one-room office for less than one year of the requisite three-year period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Western Hemisphere Trade Corporations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M-PR urges that we follow the construction that some courts have given to the phrase \"active conduct of a trade or business\" under the Western Hemisphere Trade Corporation (\"WHTC\") provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, &#167; 921, 68A Stat. at 290, that were repealed in 1976. Section 921 defined \"Western Hemisphere trade corporation\" to mean \"a domestic corporation all of whose business... is done in any ... countries in North, Central, or South America, or in the West Indies, and which satisfies\" two requirements. <i>Id.</i> One requirement was that at least 95% of the corporation's gross income for the three preceding years be derived from sources outside of the United States. <i>Id.</i> The other was that at least 90% of the corporation's gross income for the three preceding years be \"derived from the active conduct of a trade or business.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although at first cut the WHTC provision appears to be an apt point of comparison, ultimately this analogy does not assist M-PR. This is primarily because of the important differences between the purposes of the WHTC provision and &#167; 936.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress may, particularly in the internal revenue code, use the same phrase, such as \"active conduct of a trade or business,\" in attempts to reach different ends. The Supreme Court made this point in <i>Commissioner v. Groetzinger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111821\"><a href=\"/opinion/111821/commissioner-v-groetzinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111821\"><a href=\"/opinion/111821/commissioner-v-groetzinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span> (1987). After noting that the phrase \"trade or business\" appeared in over fifty sections of the Code, the Court stated: \"[I]n this opinion our interpretation of the phrase `trade or business' is confined to the specific sections of the Code at issue here. We do not purport to construe the phrase where it appears in other places.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27 &amp; n. 8, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111821\"><a href=\"/opinion/111821/commissioner-v-groetzinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span>. Other circuits construing the phrase \"trade or business\" have also concluded that the phrase has different meanings in different sections of the Internal Revenue Code. In <i>Hughes v. Commissioner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1546617\"><a href=\"/opinion/1546617/hughes-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">755</span></a></span> (10th Cir.1930), for example, the Tenth Circuit, construing the statutory phrase \"trade or business\" in section 204(a) of the Revenue Act of 1921, Pub.L. No. 67-98, &#167; 204(a), 42 Stat. 227, 231 (1921), stated that \"[w]e are here concerned only with the meaning of this phrase as used in this section. The same phrase, in other statutes, or in other sections, in a different context, and for a different purpose, may or may not be helpful.\" <i>Hughes,</i> 38 F.2d at 757. This is not to say that the WHTC provision is necessarily inapposite, but rather simply to emphasize, as we have emphasized in other contexts, that \"the same words may play different roles in different contexts.\" <i>Walker v. Exeter,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></span>, 45 n. 4 (1st Cir.2002). The relevance of the WHTC provision, then, turns on its similarity to the provision at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court has described the legislative history of the WHTC provision as disclosing a congressional \"desire to offset through a tax preference the competitive disadvantage suffered by certain American corporations abroad on account of the less onerous taxes to which their non-American competitors were subject.\" <i>Kewanee Oil Co. v. Comm'r,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">728</span></span>, 737, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2688</span></span> (1974). Accordingly,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[i]t follows that when the \"active conduct\" requirement is read in the context from which it arose, namely the threat of foreign competition, one might well conclude that in passing the Western Hemisphere provisions Congress intended to grant relief to United States business activity in the Americas only to the extent that the beneficiary corporation conducted active business operations abroad vulnerable to the competitive threat posed by the tax-advantaged corporations of other countries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 737-38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the WHTC provision, the possessions tax credit was meant to offset the competitive disadvantage suffered by American companies. The possessions tax credit, however, was meant not only to offset certain impediments for U.S. corporations investing in Puerto Rico, but also to increase investment and employment-producing opportunities in Puerto Rico. This is a difference that makes a difference. To the extent that the WHTC provision was meant to increase the foreign competitiveness of domestic corporations, the geographic location of those corporations' operations was relevant only to a limited extent &#8212; that is, it was important only to ensure that the domestic corporation actually engaged in some foreign commerce. In contrast, the possessions tax credit was meant, in addition to advancing the competitiveness of domestic corporations, to stimulate investment in particular places, including Puerto Rico. On this account, unlike the WHTC provision, the location of the corporation's trade or business was critical to advancing this goal. After all, the goal is promoting investment in the possessions &#8212; a goal the attainment of which is intrinsically tied to the location of the investments made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M-PR relies on <i>Frank v. International Canadian Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"258340\"><a href=\"/opinion/258340/william-e-frank-district-director-of-bureau-of-internal-revenue-for-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span> (9th Cir. 1962), a Ninth Circuit decision applying the WHTC provision of section 109 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. It is far from clear that this court would have viewed <i>Frank</i>'s facts the same way and reached the same outcome as did the Ninth Circuit, even under the WHTC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Frank,</i> the Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Corporation of Washington, a domestic corporation that regularly conducted business activities in British Columbia, decided to assume new shipping responsibilities. <i>Id.</i> at 522-23. For legitimate business reasons having to do with the most favored nation clauses in its contracts and the Robinson-Patman Act's prohibitions, Washington decided to form a new corporation, named International Canadian Corporation, as a WHTC, in order to perform the shipping. <i>Id.</i> International, in turn, had one full-time employee and assumed the parent's sales functions. <i>Id.</i> International did utilize services of Washington's employees and paid for those services. <i>Id.</i> at 523. The Ninth Circuit held, on review of a district court decision, that International, which came into existence for legitimate business reasons unrelated to the WHTC provision, was not disqualified from the WHTC credit although it had assumed former business of Washington, utilized and paid for help from Washington's employees, and did not have a source of supply or customers independent of Washington's. <i>Id.</i> at 526-27. The court found that International clearly was active, earning its income by performing a variety of services relating to the sale of chemical products. <i>Id.</i> at 525-27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ninth Circuit's opinion is of limited utility because of the factual distinctions between it and the case here. For example, <i>Frank</i> found that International's existence was justified by a legitimate business purpose. <i>Id.</i> at 526. At least from early 1990, when M-USA had decided not to build a manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico, it is difficult to view M-PR as anything other than a corporate shell with little business reason to exist other than to attempt to secure the &#167; 936 credit. Furthermore, as already discussed, the divergent policy goals of the possessions tax credit and the WHTC provision mean that the analogy is strained from the start. Nothing in the history of the WHTC leads us to the taxpayer's interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Analogy to Other Regulatory Definitions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court found twenty-two uses of the phrase \"active conduct of a trade or business\" in the Internal Revenue Code. <i>Medchem,</i> 116 T.C. at 330 &amp; n. 13. M-PR argues that the Tax Court erred in looking by analogy to regulations interpreting \"active conduct of a trade or business\" as used in 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 179, 355, and 367, for purposes of interpreting the phrase as used in &#167; 936.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The argument is that the purposes of those sections are so different from the purpose of &#167; 936 that their selection was arbitrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not think the selection was arbitrary. We analyze one example to demonstrate our point. M-PR says the regulation under &#167; 179 is not analogous because that regulation is explicit: it refers to a trade or business \"actively conducted <i>by the taxpayer.</i>\" 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.179-2(c)(6) (2001) (emphasis added). It states, in part, that \"a taxpayer generally is considered to actively conduct a trade or business if the taxpayer meaningfully participates in the management or operations of the trade or business. A mere passive investor in a trade or business does not actively conduct the trade or business.\" <i>Id.</i> As stated earlier, our view is that the \"by the taxpayer\" requirement is implicit in &#167; 936, and so the analogy to 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.179-2(c)(6) is not strained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M-PR argues that the more appropriate analogy is to 26 U.S.C. &#167; 936(h)(5), and guidance provided thereunder, which, M-PR says, contemplates the use of contract manufacturers. That section states, in relevant part, that an electing corporation shall not be treated as having a significant business presence in a possession with respect to a product produced in whole or in part by the electing corporation in the possession... unless such product is manufactured or produced in the possession by the electing corporation within the meaning of subsection (d)(1)(A) of section 954.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">26 U.S.C. &#167; 936(h)(5). Section 954(d)(1)(A) states that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the term \"foreign base company sales income\" means income ... derived in connection with the purchase of personal property from a related person and its sale to any person, the sale of personal property to any person on behalf of a related person, the purchase of personal property from any person and its sale to a related person, or the purchase of personal property from any person on behalf of a related person where &#8212; (A) the property which is purchased (or in the case of property sold on behalf of a related person, the property which is sold) is manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted outside the country under the laws of which the controlled foreign corporation is created or organized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">26 U.S.C. &#167; 954(d)(1) (2000). M-PR says that it relied on a Revenue Ruling concluding that, under &#167; 954, when a \"controlled foreign corporation\" contracts out a manufacturing process to another manufacturer, the contract manufacturer's performance is considered to be performance by the controlled foreign corporation. <i>See</i> Rev. Rul. 75-7, 1975-1 C.B. 244, 1975 WL 34793. M-PR says &#167; 936(a)(2) must be read, in light of Revenue Ruling 75-7, not to require the taxpayer actually to supervise the contract manufacturer's activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two sections, however, measure different things. As the Commissioner points out, the Revenue Ruling allows contract manufacturing to be taken into account in narrow situations, not present here. Section 936(h)(1) taxes \"intangible property income\" to the U.S. shareholder of the &#167; 936 corporation unless the &#167; 936 corporation elects either the cost sharing or profit split method. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 936(h)(5)(C). To make that election, the &#167; 936 corporation must have a \"significant business presence\" (\"SBP\") in the possession as to that product or service. In order to show a \"significant business presence\" certain numerical tests must be met and, in addition, the product must be manufactured or produced in the possession within the meaning of &#167; 954(d)(1)(A). For these stated purposes, contract manufacturing costs may be attributed to the taxpayer as allowed by the regulations. Those regulations, <i>for purposes of the SBP requirement,</i> permit a possessions corporation to treat the cost of contract manufacturing as a cost of direct labor. <i>See</i> 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.936-5(c). The purpose appears to be to permit a taxpayer who <i>has already satisfied</i> the 75% \"active conduct of a trade or business\" requirement <i>then</i> to obtain &#167; 936 credit for the contract manufactured product. We reject the argument that the section 936(h)(5) provisions govern by analogy the initial question of what is meant by the active conduct of a trade or business.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F. Application of Section 936(a) to the Facts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under our understanding of the statutory term, the requisite gross income of M-PR, over the relevant three-year time period, was not \"derived from the active conduct of a trade or business within a possession of the United States.\" 26 U.S.C. &#167; 936(a)(2)(B). This is because M-PR was not engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business in Puerto Rico for the three preceding years. The Tax Court was \"not even able to find that MedChem P.R. had any meaningful business activity in Puerto Rico.\" <i>Medchem,</i> 116 T.C. at 337. We agree that, whatever M-PR's presence in Puerto Rico, over the relevant time-period, it did not actively conduct a trade or business there. A-PR and M-USA, but not M-PR, directed and controlled all of the Avitene business activities. A-PR performed the tasks required in the manufacturing process, without the ability of M-PR to control any part of that process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During much of the relevant three-year period, M-PR had no employees. Its one employee, Mr. Perez, was a former A-PR employee who worked out of a one-room office maintained by M-PR. He worked for M-PR from March 1988 to June 1990, though only about ten months of his employment occurred during the relevant three-year period. M-PR argues that, for other reasons, A-PR activities must be attributed to M-PR, and that A-PR employees are M-PR's employees. The Tax Court adopted as its definition of an employee of M-PR the definition used by the IRS to determine if an individual is an employee for payroll tax and withholding purposes. <i>See Medchem,</i> 116 T.C. at 341-43 (citing 26 C.F.R. &#167; 31.3401(c)-1(b) (stating, among other things, that \"if an individual is subject to the control or direction of another merely as to the result to be accomplished by the work and not as to the means and methods for accomplishing the result, he is not an employee\")). Under that approach, neither A-PR nor the contract employees meet the test. Nor do those M-USA employees who served as M-PR officers but received no compensation from M-PR. We think the Tax Court's approach was correct because we agree that none of the purported M-PR employees were subject to M-PR's control as to the means and methods of carrying out the production and sale of Avitene. Even were this not the case, we also think it significant that, until this litigation, M-PR consistently treated these individuals as nonemployees for tax purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, M-PR makes a policy argument that it should be within the scope of the tax credit because it created jobs in the sense that it could have chosen earlier to move the Avitene production process out of Puerto Rico. Had it done so, there would have been a net job loss. But avoiding the destruction of jobs is not the same as creating new job opportunities, which was part of Congress's concern. It would seem contrary to congressional intent to create incentives for American companies to threaten the loss of contract manufacturing jobs in Puerto Rico unless the American companies were given the possessions tax credit. More significantly, M-PR's argument is too broad. All investment, of whatever nature, in Puerto Rico may be thought to contribute to job producing opportunities. But Congress did not intend the credit to apply whatever the nature of the investment. Congress limited the credit to those involved in the \"active conduct of a trade or business.\" And that does not describe what the taxpayer here did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">G.

Section 179 deals with the election to expense certain depreciable business assets. It states, in part, that \"[a] taxpayer may elect to treat the cost of any section 179 property as an expense which is not chargeable to capital account.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 179(a). It defines \"Section 179 property,\" for purposes of &#167; 179, as \"any tangible property (to which section 168 applies) which is section 1245 property (as defined in section 1245(a)(3)) and which is acquired by purchase for use in the <i>active conduct of a trade or business.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 179(d)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(2) 26 U.S.C. &#167; 355 (2000). Section 355 deals with the distribution of stock and securities of a controlled corporation. Section 355(a)'s provisions apply only if either &#8212; (A) the distributing corporation, and the controlled corporation ... is engaged immediately after the distribution in the <i>active conduct of a trade or business,</i> or (B) immediately before the distribution, the distributing corporation had no assets other than stock or securities in the controlled corporations and each of the controlled corporations is engaged immediately after the distribution in the <i>active conduct of a trade or business.</i></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 355(b)(1) (emphases added).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(3) 26 U.S.C. &#167; 367 (2000). Section 367 deals with foreign corporations. It provides that, if in connection with certain defined exchanges, United States persons transfer property to foreign corporations, \"such foreign corporation shall not, for purposes of determining the extent to which gain shall be recognized on such transfer, be considered to be a corporation.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 367(a)(1). But, in general, &#167; 367(a)(1) does \"not apply to any property transferred to a foreign corporation for use by such foreign corporation in the <i>active conduct of a trade or business</i> outside of the United States.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 367(a)(3)(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The taxpayer relies on cases arising under other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, which hold that a taxpayer need not manufacture its own product but may be a manufacturer by use of a contract manufacturer<i>See Suzy's Zoo v.
