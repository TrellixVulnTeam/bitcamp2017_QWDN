Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n                      Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n                Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\f     Michael G. Weinberg, with whom Oteri, Weinberg & Lawson, were\non brief, for Michael L. Carucci.\n     Demetra Lambros, Attorney, with whom Michael J. Sullivan,\nUnited States Attorney, Richard L. Hoffman, Assistant United States\nAttorney, and James D. Herbert, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwere on brief, for the United States.\n\n\n\n\n                          April 13, 2004\n\f           STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge. Defendant-appellant Michael\n\nCarucci was a real estate broker and a business associate of\n\nStephen Flemmi, the notorious leader of Boston's \"Winter Hill\n\nGang.\"    Carucci and Flemmi were indicted on charges relating to\n\nmoney-laundering, but only Carucci's case was tried.          Both during\n\nand after the jury trial, the district court, pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 29, entered judgments of acquittal on dozens of the\n\ncharged counts. Ultimately, Carucci was found guilty of two counts\n\nof engaging in monetary transactions in criminally-derived property\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957.\n\n           On   appeal,   Carucci    contends   that   the   evidence   was\n\ninsufficient to establish criminal liability under the statute, and\n\nchallenges the trial court's \"willful blindness\" instruction to the\n\njury.    The government cross-appeals, contending that the district\n\ncourt erred in entering the post-verdict judgments of acquittal; in\n\nordering a conditional new trial should the Rule 29 rulings be\n\nreversed; and in sentencing.        For the reasons set forth below, we\n\nreverse Carucci's conviction on the two counts and affirm the\n\ndistrict court's judgments of acquittal on the remainder.\n\n                             I. BACKGROUND\n\nA.         Factual history\n\n           We set forth the facts underlying Carucci's convictions\n\nin the light most favorable to the verdict.        See United States v.\n\nDiaz, 300 F.3d 66, 69 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            1.      238 Marlborough Street\n\n            Carucci's company, Group Boston Real Estate, managed a\n\nbuilding at 238 Marlborough Street in Boston.    One of the owners of\n\nthe property expressed interest in selling, and Carucci offered to\n\nhelp find a buyer.     In 1991, Carucci submitted a bid from Flemmi.\n\nDuring the negotiations, the seller asked Carucci where Flemmi's\n\nmoney was coming from, and Carucci told them it was from lottery\n\nwinnings.    Flemmi, however, told others that the money was from a\n\nfamily trust.    A few months after the sale, Carucci told the seller\n\nthat the money had come from Flemmi's family.\n\n            In the course of the property sale, Carucci referred\n\nFlemmi to Anthony Summers, a real estate lawyer. At trial, Summers\n\ntestified that in September, 1992, Carucci asked Summers whether he\n\nthought it would be a problem to sell real estate to Flemmi.\n\nSummers responded, \"as long as he did everything legally, that I\n\ndidn't think he'd have a problem.\"\n\n            On October 2, 1992, the Marlborough Street deal closed\n\nfor $945,000. Carucci, Summers, and Flemmi, among others, attended\n\nthe closing.     The purchaser was a nominee trust set up by Summers,\n\nthe \"238 Marlborough Street Trust.\"     The trustees were Carucci and\n\none of Flemmi's sons, Stephen Hussey; Flemmi was the beneficial\n\nowner.   Flemmi paid in cash with seven checks.      The checks were\n\ndrawn from different accounts, none of which bore Flemmi’s name,\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fand different banks.      Three were payable to the Mary Irene Trust1\n\n(of which Flemmi was a trustee), three were payable to Mary Flemmi\n\n(Flemmi’s mother) and one was payable to Jeanette Flemmi (Flemmi’s\n\nex-wife). In conjunction with the sale, Summers drafted a mortgage\n\nevidencing a $975,000 loan from the Mary Irene Trust to the 238\n\nMarlborough Street Trust.       The mortgage, on which Flemmi's name\n\nappeared, was publicly recorded.\n\n           Also on October 2, 1992, Flemmi and Carucci entered a\n\njoint venture agreement concerning the development and sale of the\n\ncondominium units at 238 Marlborough Street.            Carucci invested\n\n$15,000 of his sales commission into the joint venture, and Flemmi\n\nhandled the remaining costs.\n\n           2.        362 Commonwealth Avenue\n\n           In mid-1992, another real estate broker told Carucci that\n\n362   Commonwealth    Avenue   in   Boston,   a   commercial   condominium\n\ncontaining a    laundromat, was available as an investment property.\n\nCarucci submitted an offer on the property signed by Hussey as\n\ntrustee of SMS Realty Trust and provided a binder check for $1,000\n\nsigned by him and drawn on the account of Group Boston.           He also\n\nparticipated in the sale negotiations.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The money contributed by the trust constitutes more than half\nof the total payment and can be linked to a series of substantial\ncash deposits over a one-month period in 1982 at Winter Hill\nSavings Bank.\n\n                                    -5-\n\f          According      to    the   purchase   and    sale   agreement,   the\n\npurchaser of the property was Jeannette Benedetti, trustee of Comm-\n\n1 Realty Trust.    The agreement was signed by Benedetti and Karen\n\nSnow, Flemmi's daughters. On October 26, 1992, Carucci signed over\n\nto the listing broker a check for $5,125 from the Mount Washington\n\nBank payable to Group Boston to serve as a deposit.\n\n          At the property closing on December 9, 1992, three checks\n\nwere tendered as payment: a Mount Washington Bank check in the\n\namount of $30,500 and a Hyde Park Savings Bank check in the amount\n\nof $70,000, both payable to Benedetti, and a $16,408.37 Winter Hill\n\nFederal Savings Bank check payable to Summers & Summers.\n\n          Prior to the closing, in November, 1992, Commonwealth\n\nLaundries, Inc. was formed, with Carucci and Flemmi as the major\n\nstockholders.     Jian-Fen Hu, Flemmi's girlfriend, was president,\n\ntreasurer, clerk, and director. On December 11, 1992, Commonwealth\n\nLaundries entered into a lease of 362 Commonwealth Avenue with\n\nComm-1 Realty Trust.          Hu and Benedetti (as trustee) signed the\n\nlease.   Commonwealth Laundries borrowed $120,000 from the Mary\n\nIrene Trust to purchase equipment and $110,000 from Flemmi for\n\nimprovements.\n\n          At    trial,    Flemmi's     other    son,   William   St.   Croix,\n\ntestified pursuant to an immunity agreement about his many years of\n\ncriminal activity.    He also testified that he first met Carucci at\n\nhis father's home in Milton, Massachusetts, in 1990 or 1991.                At\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fthat time, Carucci told him he was going to broker the sale of the\n\nhouse. When St. Croix asked Carucci if he knew who his father was,\n\nCarucci responded, \"Yes, everybody knows who your father is.                 Your\n\nfather was the big guy.\"         St. Croix testified that he visited Group\n\nBoston's offices \"probably hundreds of times.\"\n\nB.           Procedural history\n\n            On March 11, 1997, a grand jury of the United States\n\nDistrict    Court    for   the    District     of    Massachusetts     returned   a\n\n103-count indictment against Flemmi and Carucci.                 It charged both\n\ndefendants with conspiracy to commit money-laundering in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h); substantive money-laundering offenses in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956; transactions in criminally derived\n\nproperty in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957; and              RICO conspiracy in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d).                In May 2001, as part of a\n\nconsolidated plea in another case, Flemmi pleaded guilty to an\n\ninformation    that      encompassed     the    money-laundering       conspiracy\n\ncharges and the charges against him in this case were dismissed.\n\n            In March and April, 2002, Carucci alone was tried before\n\na jury.    At the close of the government's case, pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 29(a), the district court granted Carucci's motions for\n\njudgment of acquittal on counts 1, 14-66, and 76-103.                     It then\n\nsubmitted counts 2-13 and 70-75 to the jury.              These counts charged\n\nviolations    of    §§   1956    and   1957    and   concerned   the   laundromat\n\nventure.      Specifically, counts 9-13 and 73-75 related to the\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fpurchase of the condominium, and counts 2-8 and 70-72 related to\n\nthe purchase of the laundry equipment.\n\n            On April 16, 2002, the jury returned a verdict finding\n\nCarucci not guilty on the § 1956 counts (2-13) and guilty on the §\n\n1957 counts (70-75). At a post-verdict hearing, the district court\n\ngranted   judgment    of    acquittal      on   counts       70-72   and    74,   and\n\nprovisionally granted a new trial on those counts.                         This left\n\nstanding only the verdicts on counts 73 and 75, which concern,\n\nrespectively, the December 9, 1992, transfer of a Mount Washington\n\nBank check in the amount of $30,500 and a Hyde Park Savings Bank\n\ncheck in the amount of $70,000.\n\n            On   December   20,    2002,    the    district     court      sentenced\n\nCarucci to ten months in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, with\n\na recommendation that Carucci serve his sentence in a community\n\nconfinement      center   (CCC),   followed       by    twenty-four     months      of\n\nsupervised release.         The same day, the Department of Justice\n\nannounced that the Bureau of Prisons would no longer permit CCC\n\nplacement for more than ten percent of the sentence imposed.                        On\n\nDecember 31, 2002, the district court revised the sentence to\n\nencompass   five     months'   incarceration           and   five    months'      home\n\nconfinement.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f                                  II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.          Carucci's challenge to his conviction under\n            18 U.S.C. § 1957\n\n            Carucci contends that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nconvict him on counts 73 and 75, which charge him with engaging in\n\nmonetary transactions in criminally-derived property in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 1957.         We review Rule 29 determinations de novo.\n\nUnited States v. Boulerice, 325 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing\n\nUnited States v. Carroll, 105 F.3d 740, 742 (1st Cir. 1997)).                  We\n\nwill affirm the conviction if, \"after assaying all the evidence in\n\nthe light most amiable to the government, and taking all reasonable\n\ninferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the\n\nessential elements of the crime.\"            Id. (quoting United States v.\n\nO'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir. 1994)).\n\n            To   establish    a    violation   of   18   U.S.C.   §   1957,   the\n\ngovernment must prove that (1) the defendant engaged or attempted\n\nto engage in a monetary transaction with a value of more than\n\n$10,000; (2) the defendant knew that the property involved in the\n\ntransaction had been derived from some form of criminal activity;\n\nand (3) the property involved in the transaction was actually\n\nderived from specified unlawful activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a)(1).2\n\n\n     2\n      18   U.S.C. § 1957(a)(1) states, in relevant part:\n\"Whoever    . . . knowingly engages or attempts to engage in a\nmonetary    transaction in criminally derived property of a value\ngreater    than $10,000 and is derived from specified unlawful\n\n                                       -9-\n\fSubsection (c) of the statute provides: \"the Government is not\n\nrequired to prove the defendant knew that the offense from which\n\nthe criminally derived property was derived was specified unlawful\n\nactivity.\"   Id. § 1957(c).   In other words, a defendant may not be\n\nconvicted under § 1957(a) unless he knew that the transaction\n\ninvolved \"criminally derived property,\" but he need not know that\n\nthe property was derived from the \"specified unlawful activity.\"\n\nUnited States v. Richard, 234 F.3d 763, 768 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(quoting United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 65 (1st Cir. 1995))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           Carucci maintains that the evidence as to each of these\n\nelements is insufficient to support conviction on counts 73 and 75.\n\nWe need not address the first two requirements of § 1957, because\n\nwe hold that the government did not adduce sufficient evidence that\n\nthe purchase of 362 Commonwealth was derived from proceeds from\n\nspecified unlawful activity.     We explain below.\n\n           1.     Scope of the specified unlawful activity\n\n           A threshold issue on appeal is the scope of the specified\n\nunlawful activity (\"SUA\") charged to the jury.       The indictment set\n\nforth four SUAs as underlying the §§ 1956 and 1957 charges: drug\n\ntrafficking, extortion, loan sharking, and gambling.           During the\n\ncharge   conference,   the   district   court   ruled   that   there   was\n\n\n\n\nactivity, shall be punished . . .\"\n\n                                 -10-\n\finsufficient evidence to submit loan sharking and drug dealing to\n\nthe jury.\n\n            In the jury charge, however, the court's instructions\n\nwere inconsistent.    During two occasions in the charge, the court\n\ninstructed that all four crimes constituted specified unlawful\n\nactivity.    First, it stated:\n\n            You are instructed that the offenses of\n            conducting an illegal gambling business,\n            engaging in extortionate credit transactions,\n            interference with commerce by extortion, and\n            distribution and conspiracy to distribute\n            narcotics . . . constitute specified unlawful\n            activity . . .\n\nLater,   after   reciting   the   four   offenses   again,   the   court\n\ninstructed:\n\n            Each of the crimes just listed qualifies as\n            specified criminal activity.     Thus, if you\n            find beyond a reasonable doubt that any of the\n            funds involved in the transactions listed in\n            the indictment derived from the commission of\n            any of these crimes by any person, then the\n            transactions involved proceeds derived from\n            specified criminal activity.3\n\nThe court then stated that it would provide further details as to\n\nthe elements of the SUA offenses later.\n\n            In the context of instructing on §§ 1956 and 1957,\n\nhowever, the court described only the elements of extortion and\n\ngambling.     As to those two offenses, it stated that it was\n\n\n\n    3\n      This instruction was given during the portion of the charge\ndealing with the § 1956 claim. It was expressly incorporated into\nthe portion concerning § 1957.\n\n                                  -11-\n\finstructing the jury \"as to the elements of the offenses listed as\n\nspecified unlawful activity in the indictment . . .\"             It set forth\n\nthe elements of extortion and gambling that the government had to\n\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt in order for the jury to find a\n\ncrime \"from which Flemmi derived illegal proceeds.\"          The court did\n\nnot state the elements of loan sharking or drug trafficking, and\n\ndid not mention those offenses again.\n\n           Carucci maintains that the district court's failure to\n\nset forth the elements of drug trafficking prevented the jury from\n\nbasing a § 1957 conviction on that SUA.4       We need not decide this\n\nissue    because,   even   assuming   that   the   jury    was    instructed\n\ncorrectly, there is insufficient record evidence that the funds\n\nused in the real estate transactions were actually derived from the\n\nspecified unlawful activities, as opposed to other criminally\n\nderived proceeds.     See section II(A)(2), infra.\n\n           2.       Evidence of specified unlawful activity\n\n           As discussed supra, the statute requires proof that the\n\nproperty involved in the transaction was actually derived from\n\nspecified unlawful activity.     18 U.S.C. § 1957(a).       Application of\n\nthis requirement is not always straightforward.           This circuit and\n\nothers have held that § 1957 convictions necessitate proof beyond\n\n\n\n     4\n      At oral argument before this court, the government expressly\nabandoned its argument that loan sharking constituted a SUA for\npurposes of the § 1957 charge. Accordingly, we do not consider it\nfurther.\n\n                                  -12-\n\fa reasonable doubt of the predicate crime.                          See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Burgos, 254 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir. 2001) (stating that in\n\norder to convict the defendant of money-laundering, \"the government\n\nhad to prove that he had attempted to distribute cocaine to satisfy\n\nthe specified unlawful activity element of the crime\" (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)); United States v. Lovett, 964 F.2d 1029,\n\n1041-42   (10th       Cir.    1992)   (\"the       elements      of    the     particular\n\n'specified unlawful activity' . . . are essential elements that the\n\nprosecution must prove in order to establish a violation of §\n\n1957\"); see also United States v. Blackman, 904 F.2d 1250, 1257\n\n(8th   Cir.    1990).        However,     proof     of   a    specific,       individual\n\nunderlying offense -- i.e., a particular unlawful mailing in a mail\n\nfraud SUA, or a particular drug sale in a drug trafficking SUA -–\n\nis not necessary to support a § 1957 conviction.                     See United States\n\nv. Richard, 234 F.3d 763, 768 (1st Cir. 2000); United States v.\n\nMankarious,     151    F.3d    694,   701-02      (7th       Cir.    1998).      Rather,\n\ncircumstantial evidence may suffice to allow a jury to infer a\n\npredicate     act    from    an   overall    criminal        scheme.        See,     e.g.,\n\nMankarious, 151 F.3d at 702-03; United States v. Jackson, 983 F.2d\n\n757, 766-67 (7th Cir. 1993); Blackman, 904 F.2d at 1257.\n\n              Even    applying     this     broad    construction           of   §    1957\n\nliability, the evidence of specified unlawful activity adduced at\n\n\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\fCarucci's trial was insufficient to support his conviction.5            We\n\nfirst consider the evidence of gambling and extortion, the two SUAs\n\nthat were unequivocally charged to the jury.         During the extensive\n\ntrial testimony, the only specific mention of either gambling or\n\nextortion was by Flemmi's son, St. Croix.      Initially, he testified\n\nas to his personal criminal history:\n\n            Q: What other types of criminal activities\n            have you been involved in?\n\n            A: I have been involved in drug rip-offs,\n            selling drugs, extortion, gambling, arson,\n            operating an illegal club.\n\nSt. Croix then stated that Flemmi was involved in \"some\" of those\n\nactivities, but did not specify which ones.           No other witnesses\n\ntestified about Flemmi's participation in gambling or extortion, or\n\nabout    proceeds   therefrom.   Thus,   at   very    best,   St.   Croix's\n\ntestimony fell short of stating that Flemmi engaged in gambling or\n\nextortion, and there was simply no other evidence on this critical\n\npoint.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      The government attempted but failed to present additional\nevidence concerning the SUAs.      At trial, the district court\nexcluded extensive testimony by government witnesses concerning\nFlemmi's participation in extortion, drug dealing and gambling\nschemes, as well as his lack of legitimate income.       The court\ndetermined that the proffered evidence was insufficiently linked to\nthe transactions specified in the indictment and to Carucci's\ncriminal liability. Additionally, the court held that some of the\nevidence suffered from hearsay and relevance problems.          The\ngovernment's position on appeal is that the evidence that the\ndistrict court allowed in was sufficient, standing alone, to\nsupport Carucci's § 1957 convictions.\n\n                                 -14-\n\f            St.   Croix's   testimony suffers from an additional\n\nweakness: it did not indicate a time frame in which the gambling\n\nand extortion, if any, occurred.         In order to establish § 1957\n\nliability, Flemmi must have derived proceeds from gambling or\n\nextortion   before   November   22,   1992,   the   last   date   money   was\n\ndeposited into the accounts on which the transactions at issue were\n\ndrawn.   See Mankarious, 151 F.3d at 704 (\"A money launderer must\n\nobtain proceeds before laundering can take place.\"); United States\n\nv. Christo, 129 F.3d 578, 580 (11th Cir. 1997) (same).\n\n            After careful consideration of the record, we conclude\n\nthat there was insufficient evidence for a rational jury to find\n\nthat Flemmi derived proceeds from gambling or extortion before\n\nNovember 22, 1992.       The gambling SUA, as the district court\n\ninstructed, required proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Flemmi\n\nconducted a gambling business that (1) violated Massachusetts law;\n\n(2) was knowingly and intentionally conducted, financed, managed,\n\nsupervised, directed or owned by five or more persons; and (3)\n\nwhich was either in substantially continuous operation for thirty\n\nor more days or had a gross revenue of $2000 or more on any single\n\nday.   See 18 U.S.C. § 1955.    Even if the jury could have reasonably\n\ninferred a violation of Massachusetts law, there was no evidence\n\npresented to the jury as to the second or third elements required\n\nfor the specified federal gambling crime.             Moreover, the term\n\n\"gambling\" is possessed of common meanings apart from the legal\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fdefinition.   See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 932\n\n(1986).   Even if the jury believed that Flemmi was involved with\n\n\"gambling,\" we cannot presume that it found that all of the\n\nelements of § 1955 were satisfied.\n\n          As to extortion, the SUA required the government to prove\n\nthat (1) Flemmi knowingly and willfully obtained property from the\n\nvictim by means of extortion; (2) Flemmi knew that the victim\n\nparted with property because of extortion; and (3) the extortion\n\naffected interstate commerce.6     18 U.S.C. § 1951.      Again, no\n\nevidence was presented to the jury as to these elements.    As with\n\ngambling, St. Croix's equivocal identification of Flemmi with only\n\n\"some\" of his own criminal activities fell short of indicating that\n\n\"extortion\" was one of them.    Furthermore, even if the jury could\n\nreasonably surmise from St. Croix's use of the terms \"gambling\" and\n\n\"extortion\" that Flemmi's conduct satisfied the statutory elements\n\nof those offenses, there is no evidence linking it to the relevant\n\naccounts during the relevant time period in the relevant amount.\n\n          As to the SUA of drug trafficking, the government points\n\nto two pieces of evidence purporting to link Flemmi to drug\n\ntrafficking proceeds.    First, St. Croix testified that a drug\n\ndealer named Johnny Debs agreed to purchase $100,000 of cocaine\n\nfrom him in the late 1980s.   He stated that Debs knew nothing about\n\n\n\n     6\n      It appears to be undisputed that it is Flemmi's criminal\nconduct that is at issue for purposes of § 1957, not St. Croix's.\n\n                                -16-\n\fSt. Croix, but approached him because of Flemmi’s reputation as a\n\nnarcotics dealer.       Second, St. Croix testified that he took drugs\n\nfrom dealers whom he promised to pay after selling the drugs.            He\n\ndid not intend to repay the dealers, however, and said he instead\n\n\"would divvy it up with people that I was involved in and later my\n\nfather.” (It is not entirely clear from the testimony whether this\n\nscheme was merely a plan, or whether the \"divvying\" in fact took\n\nplace.)     St. Croix also testified that he was involved in drug\n\ntrafficking from 1989 to 1997.\n\n            Assuming without deciding that this evidence shows that\n\nFlemmi engaged in drug trafficking, it falls short of establishing\n\nthat the funds used in the real estate transactions were actually\n\nderived from drug funds as opposed to other criminally-derived\n\nproceeds.    As with gambling and extortion, there is no evidence as\n\nto the amount of proceeds or the specific time frame in which the\n\nproceeds were conveyed to Flemmi.       Indeed, the fact that St. Croix\n\nspecified that any sharing with Flemmi happened \"later\" suggests\n\nthat Flemmi was unlikely to have derived drug-trafficking proceeds\n\nbefore the 1992 transaction.          Accordingly, to infer from this\n\ntestimony that at least $10,000 of the funds involved in the real\n\nestate    transaction    in   1992   were   derived   from   Flemmi's   drug\n\ntrafficking is too great a stretch.\n\n            The government points to evidence of Flemmi's leadership\n\nof an organized crime gang and apparent lack of legitimate income\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fto support the SUAs.      It argues that the testimony that Flemmi was\n\na leader of the Winter Hill Gang \"told the jury much about Flemmi\n\nand his money.\"7      The government also points to the fact that\n\nFlemmi's parents had meager incomes and lived frugally, and hence\n\ncould not have provided any money to Flemmi for the purchase.\n\n             While these factors certainly suggest criminally derived\n\nincome in a general sense, the evidence fails to supply a link to\n\ngambling, extortion or drug trafficking specifically.                 Accepting\n\nthat Flemmi's income was illegitimate, it could have been linked to\n\nany number of criminal activities; to conclude from this evidence\n\nthat Flemmi derived proceeds from the specified SUAs is simply too\n\nspeculative.\n\n             Moreover, a § 1957 conviction cannot be based solely on\n\nthe finding that a known criminal had no other legitimate income.\n\nBlackman, 904 F.2d at 1257.       In the cases cited by the government,\n\ncourts generally affirm money-laundering convictions only where\n\nsuch evidence is accompanied by additional, more specific indicia\n\nof criminal activity.       See, e.g., United States v. Hetherington,\n\n256   F.3d   788,   794   (8th   Cir.   2001)     (evidence    of   defendant's\n\nawareness    that   his   company's     \"entire    operation    was   based   on\n\ndeceit\"); United States v. Eastman, 149 F.3d 802, 804 (8th Cir.\n\n\n      7\n      The government also goes into some depth as to St. Croix's\ninvolvement with drug dealing and extortion and expressly urges us\nto apply the saying \"like father, like son.\" None of the evidence\nconcerning St. Croix's conduct supports a conclusion that Flemmi\nhimself engaged in the SUAs.\n\n                                      -18-\n\f1998) (evidence of defendant's illegal drug purchases, and evidence\n\nthat the money defendant provided for transaction had a drug\n\nscent); United States v. Meshack, 225 F.3d 556, 572 n.12 (5th Cir.\n\n2000) (evidence of drug transactions at defendant's restaurant);\n\nUnited    States      v.    King,    169    F.3d   1035,    1039    (6th     Cir.    1999)\n\n(evidence      that        defendant       \"coordinated      a   multi-person         drug\n\ndistribution business\").\n\n             The government also contends that Flemmi's use of cash\n\nand money orders -- as well as his use of multiple banks, multiple\n\nchecks, and nominee trusts -- supports the inference that the\n\ntransactions were derived from SUAs. Again, this evidence does not\n\nestablish a sufficient nexus to the specified SUAs.                          While it is\n\ntrue that a suspiciously structured financial transaction can\n\nconstitute circumstantial evidence of money-laundering, the cases\n\ncited by the government consistently feature additional evidence of\n\nunlawful activity.            See, e.g., United States v. Smith, 223 F.3d\n\n554,   577    (7th     Cir.       2000)    (\"Witnesses      testified      that     Wilson\n\npersonally bought and sold drugs, so the jury knew that he had\n\nillegal cash sloshing around that could have been used.\"); United\n\nStates v. Reiss, 186 F.3d 149, 152-53 (2d Cir. 1999) (in convoluted\n\nsale of      airplane,       an    associate    who   was    \"heavily        involved   in\n\nnarcotics trafficking and money laundering in the United States\"\n\nfacilitated     the        transaction).        Here,    there     is   no    comparable\n\n\n\n\n                                            -19-\n\fevidence that Flemmi had engaged in the specified SUAs in the\n\nrelevant time period.\n\n           In sum, the evidence in the § 1957 case against Carucci\n\nis simply too thin.        While Flemmi's apparent lack of legitimate\n\nincome and the structuring of his financial dealings certainly\n\nsuggest criminal activity, the government failed to prove a nexus\n\nto the alleged specified unlawful activity, much less to the\n\naccounts   involved   in    the   transactions   at   issue.    Carucci's\n\nconvictions on counts 73 and 75 cannot stand.8\n\nB.         The government's cross-appeal\n\n           We now turn to the government's cross-appeal.              The\n\ngovernment contends that the district court erred in allowing\n\nCarucci's motion for acquittal on counts 70 through 72 and 74,\n\nwhich set forth additional violations of § 1957.               (Counts 70\n\nthrough 72 related to the purchase of the laundry equipment; count\n\n74 related to the purchase of the condominium.)        As grounds for its\n\ndecision, the district court stated that there was insufficient\n\nevidence to establish that Carucci knew that the property involved\n\nin the transactions had been derived from criminal activity.\n\n           As noted supra, we review Rule 29 determinations de novo.\n\nCounts 70-72 and 74 are fatally undermined by the government's\n\nfailure of proof as to § 1957's requirement that the transactions\n\n\n     8\n      Accordingly, we need not deal with the other issues Carucci\nraises on appeal, including the adequacy of the jury instructions.\n\n                                   -20-\n\fat   issue   were   derived   from   specified    unlawful   activity.      As\n\ndiscussed    supra,   no   reasonable   jury     could   conclude   that   the\n\npurchases of the equipment or condominium involved proceeds from\n\nFlemmi's gambling, extortion, or drug trafficking. Accordingly, we\n\naffirm the district court's grant of Carucci's Rule 29 motion,\n\nalbeit on different grounds.9\n\n                              III. CONCLUSION\n\n             For the reasons set forth above, we reverse Carucci's\n\nconvictions on counts 73 and 75 of the indictment and affirm the\n\ndistrict court's judgments of acquittal on counts 70-72 and 74.\n\n\n\n\n      9\n      As a result of this holding, we need not address the district\ncourt's award of a conditional new trial should the Rule 29 rulings\nbe reversed. Nor do we address the sentencing issue raised by the\ngovernment.\n\n                                     -21-\n\f",

Defendant-appellant Michael\n\nCarucci was a real estate broker and a business associate of\n\nStephen Flemmi, the notorious leader of Boston's \"Winter Hill\n\nGang.\"    Carucci and Flemmi were indicted on charges relating to\n\nmoney-laundering, but only Carucci's case was tried.          Both during\n\nand after the jury trial, the district court, pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 29, entered judgments of acquittal on dozens of the\n\ncharged counts. Ultimately, Carucci was found guilty of two counts\n\nof engaging in monetary transactions in criminally-derived property\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957.\n\n           On   appeal,   Carucci    contends   that   the   evidence   was\n\ninsufficient to establish criminal liability under the statute, and\n\nchallenges the trial court's \"willful blindness\" instruction to the\n\njury.    The government cross-appeals, contending that the district\n\ncourt erred in entering the post-verdict judgments of acquittal; in\n\nordering a conditional new trial should the Rule 29 rulings be\n\nreversed; and in sentencing.        For the reasons set forth below, we\n\nreverse Carucci's conviction on the two counts and affirm the\n\ndistrict court's judgments of acquittal on the remainder.\n\n                             I.

One of the owners of\n\nthe property expressed interest in selling, and Carucci offered to\n\nhelp find a buyer.     In 1991, Carucci submitted a bid from Flemmi.\n\nDuring the negotiations, the seller asked Carucci where Flemmi's\n\nmoney was coming from, and Carucci told them it was from lottery\n\nwinnings.    Flemmi, however, told others that the money was from a\n\nfamily trust.    A few months after the sale, Carucci told the seller\n\nthat the money had come from Flemmi's family.\n\n            In the course of the property sale, Carucci referred\n\nFlemmi to Anthony Summers, a real estate lawyer. At trial, Summers\n\ntestified that in September, 1992, Carucci asked Summers whether he\n\nthought it would be a problem to sell real estate to Flemmi.\n\nSummers responded, \"as long as he did everything legally, that I\n\ndidn't think he'd have a problem.\"\n\n            On October 2, 1992, the Marlborough Street deal closed\n\nfor $945,000. Carucci, Summers, and Flemmi, among others, attended\n\nthe closing.     The purchaser was a nominee trust set up by Summers,\n\nthe \"238 Marlborough Street Trust.\"     The trustees were Carucci and\n\none of Flemmi's sons, Stephen Hussey; Flemmi was the beneficial\n\nowner.   Flemmi paid in cash with seven checks.      The checks were\n\ndrawn from different accounts, none of which bore Flemmi’s name,\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fand different banks.      Three were payable to the Mary Irene Trust1\n\n(of which Flemmi was a trustee), three were payable to Mary Flemmi\n\n(Flemmi’s mother) and one was payable to Jeanette Flemmi (Flemmi’s\n\nex-wife). In conjunction with the sale, Summers drafted a mortgage\n\nevidencing a $975,000 loan from the Mary Irene Trust to the 238\n\nMarlborough Street Trust.       The mortgage, on which Flemmi's name\n\nappeared, was publicly recorded.\n\n           Also on October 2, 1992, Flemmi and Carucci entered a\n\njoint venture agreement concerning the development and sale of the\n\ncondominium units at 238 Marlborough Street.            Carucci invested\n\n$15,000 of his sales commission into the joint venture, and Flemmi\n\nhandled the remaining costs.\n\n           2.        362 Commonwealth Avenue\n\n           In mid-1992, another real estate broker told Carucci that\n\n362   Commonwealth    Avenue   in   Boston,   a   commercial   condominium\n\ncontaining a    laundromat, was available as an investment property.\n\nCarucci submitted an offer on the property signed by Hussey as\n\ntrustee of SMS Realty Trust and provided a binder check for $1,000\n\nsigned by him and drawn on the account of Group Boston.           He also\n\nparticipated in the sale negotiations.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The money contributed by the trust constitutes more than half\nof the total payment and can be linked to a series of substantial\ncash deposits over a one-month period in 1982 at Winter Hill\nSavings Bank.\n\n                                    -5-\n\f          According      to    the   purchase   and    sale   agreement,   the\n\npurchaser of the property was Jeannette Benedetti, trustee of Comm-\n\n1 Realty Trust.    The agreement was signed by Benedetti and Karen\n\nSnow, Flemmi's daughters. On October 26, 1992, Carucci signed over\n\nto the listing broker a check for $5,125 from the Mount Washington\n\nBank payable to Group Boston to serve as a deposit.\n\n          At the property closing on December 9, 1992, three checks\n\nwere tendered as payment: a Mount Washington Bank check in the\n\namount of $30,500 and a Hyde Park Savings Bank check in the amount\n\nof $70,000, both payable to Benedetti, and a $16,408.37 Winter Hill\n\nFederal Savings Bank check payable to Summers & Summers.\n\n          Prior to the closing, in November, 1992, Commonwealth\n\nLaundries, Inc. was formed, with Carucci and Flemmi as the major\n\nstockholders.     Jian-Fen Hu, Flemmi's girlfriend, was president,\n\ntreasurer, clerk, and director. On December 11, 1992, Commonwealth\n\nLaundries entered into a lease of 362 Commonwealth Avenue with\n\nComm-1 Realty Trust.          Hu and Benedetti (as trustee) signed the\n\nlease.   Commonwealth Laundries borrowed $120,000 from the Mary\n\nIrene Trust to purchase equipment and $110,000 from Flemmi for\n\nimprovements.\n\n          At    trial,    Flemmi's     other    son,   William   St.   Croix,\n\ntestified pursuant to an immunity agreement about his many years of\n\ncriminal activity.    He also testified that he first met Carucci at\n\nhis father's home in Milton, Massachusetts, in 1990 or 1991.                At\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fthat time, Carucci told him he was going to broker the sale of the\n\nhouse. When St. Croix asked Carucci if he knew who his father was,\n\nCarucci responded, \"Yes, everybody knows who your father is.                 Your\n\nfather was the big guy.\"         St. Croix testified that he visited Group\n\nBoston's offices \"probably hundreds of times.\"\n\nB.           Procedural history\n\n            On March 11, 1997, a grand jury of the United States\n\nDistrict    Court    for   the    District     of    Massachusetts     returned   a\n\n103-count indictment against Flemmi and Carucci.                 It charged both\n\ndefendants with conspiracy to commit money-laundering in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h); substantive money-laundering offenses in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956; transactions in criminally derived\n\nproperty in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957; and              RICO conspiracy in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d).                In May 2001, as part of a\n\nconsolidated plea in another case, Flemmi pleaded guilty to an\n\ninformation    that      encompassed     the    money-laundering       conspiracy\n\ncharges and the charges against him in this case were dismissed.\n\n            In March and April, 2002, Carucci alone was tried before\n\na jury.    At the close of the government's case, pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 29(a), the district court granted Carucci's motions for\n\njudgment of acquittal on counts 1, 14-66, and 76-103.                     It then\n\nsubmitted counts 2-13 and 70-75 to the jury.              These counts charged\n\nviolations    of    §§   1956    and   1957    and   concerned   the   laundromat\n\nventure.      Specifically, counts 9-13 and 73-75 related to the\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fpurchase of the condominium, and counts 2-8 and 70-72 related to\n\nthe purchase of the laundry equipment.\n\n            On April 16, 2002, the jury returned a verdict finding\n\nCarucci not guilty on the § 1956 counts (2-13) and guilty on the §\n\n1957 counts (70-75). At a post-verdict hearing, the district court\n\ngranted   judgment    of    acquittal      on   counts       70-72   and    74,   and\n\nprovisionally granted a new trial on those counts.                         This left\n\nstanding only the verdicts on counts 73 and 75, which concern,\n\nrespectively, the December 9, 1992, transfer of a Mount Washington\n\nBank check in the amount of $30,500 and a Hyde Park Savings Bank\n\ncheck in the amount of $70,000.\n\n            On   December   20,    2002,    the    district     court      sentenced\n\nCarucci to ten months in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, with\n\na recommendation that Carucci serve his sentence in a community\n\nconfinement      center   (CCC),   followed       by    twenty-four     months      of\n\nsupervised release.         The same day, the Department of Justice\n\nannounced that the Bureau of Prisons would no longer permit CCC\n\nplacement for more than ten percent of the sentence imposed.                        On\n\nDecember 31, 2002, the district court revised the sentence to\n\nencompass   five     months'   incarceration           and   five    months'      home\n\nconfinement.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f                                  II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.          Carucci's challenge to his conviction under\n            18 U.S.C. § 1957\n\n            Carucci contends that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nconvict him on counts 73 and 75, which charge him with engaging in\n\nmonetary transactions in criminally-derived property in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 1957.

We explain below.\n\n           1.     Scope of the specified unlawful activity\n\n           A threshold issue on appeal is the scope of the specified\n\nunlawful activity (\"SUA\") charged to the jury.       The indictment set\n\nforth four SUAs as underlying the §§ 1956 and 1957 charges: drug\n\ntrafficking, extortion, loan sharking, and gambling.           During the\n\ncharge   conference,   the   district   court   ruled   that   there   was\n\n\n\n\nactivity, shall be punished . . .\"\n\n                                 -10-\n\finsufficient evidence to submit loan sharking and drug dealing to\n\nthe jury.\n\n            In the jury charge, however, the court's instructions\n\nwere inconsistent.    During two occasions in the charge, the court\n\ninstructed that all four crimes constituted specified unlawful\n\nactivity.    First, it stated:\n\n            You are instructed that the offenses of\n            conducting an illegal gambling business,\n            engaging in extortionate credit transactions,\n            interference with commerce by extortion, and\n            distribution and conspiracy to distribute\n            narcotics . . . constitute specified unlawful\n            activity . . .\n\nLater,   after   reciting   the   four   offenses   again,   the   court\n\ninstructed:\n\n            Each of the crimes just listed qualifies as\n            specified criminal activity.     Thus, if you\n            find beyond a reasonable doubt that any of the\n            funds involved in the transactions listed in\n            the indictment derived from the commission of\n            any of these crimes by any person, then the\n            transactions involved proceeds derived from\n            specified criminal activity.3\n\nThe court then stated that it would provide further details as to\n\nthe elements of the SUA offenses later.\n\n            In the context of instructing on §§ 1956 and 1957,\n\nhowever, the court described only the elements of extortion and\n\ngambling.     As to those two offenses, it stated that it was\n\n\n\n    3\n      This instruction was given during the portion of the charge\ndealing with the § 1956 claim. It was expressly incorporated into\nthe portion concerning § 1957.\n\n                                  -11-\n\finstructing the jury \"as to the elements of the offenses listed as\n\nspecified unlawful activity in the indictment . . .\"             It set forth\n\nthe elements of extortion and gambling that the government had to\n\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt in order for the jury to find a\n\ncrime \"from which Flemmi derived illegal proceeds.\"          The court did\n\nnot state the elements of loan sharking or drug trafficking, and\n\ndid not mention those offenses again.\n\n           Carucci maintains that the district court's failure to\n\nset forth the elements of drug trafficking prevented the jury from\n\nbasing a § 1957 conviction on that SUA.4       We need not decide this\n\nissue    because,   even   assuming   that   the   jury    was    instructed\n\ncorrectly, there is insufficient record evidence that the funds\n\nused in the real estate transactions were actually derived from the\n\nspecified unlawful activities, as opposed to other criminally\n\nderived proceeds.     See section II(A)(2), infra.\n\n           2.       Evidence of specified unlawful activity\n\n           As discussed supra, the statute requires proof that the\n\nproperty involved in the transaction was actually derived from\n\nspecified unlawful activity.     18 U.S.C. § 1957(a).       Application of\n\nthis requirement is not always straightforward.           This circuit and\n\nothers have held that § 1957 convictions necessitate proof beyond\n\n\n\n     4\n      At oral argument before this court, the government expressly\nabandoned its argument that loan sharking constituted a SUA for\npurposes of the § 1957 charge. Accordingly, we do not consider it\nfurther.\n\n                                  -12-\n\fa reasonable doubt of the predicate crime.                          See, e.g., United\n\nStates v.

During the extensive\n\ntrial testimony, the only specific mention of either gambling or\n\nextortion was by Flemmi's son, St. Croix.      Initially, he testified\n\nas to his personal criminal history:\n\n            Q: What other types of criminal activities\n            have you been involved in?\n\n            A: I have been involved in drug rip-offs,\n            selling drugs, extortion, gambling, arson,\n            operating an illegal club.\n\nSt. Croix then stated that Flemmi was involved in \"some\" of those\n\nactivities, but did not specify which ones.           No other witnesses\n\ntestified about Flemmi's participation in gambling or extortion, or\n\nabout    proceeds   therefrom.   Thus,   at   very    best,   St.   Croix's\n\ntestimony fell short of stating that Flemmi engaged in gambling or\n\nextortion, and there was simply no other evidence on this critical\n\npoint.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      The government attempted but failed to present additional\nevidence concerning the SUAs.      At trial, the district court\nexcluded extensive testimony by government witnesses concerning\nFlemmi's participation in extortion, drug dealing and gambling\nschemes, as well as his lack of legitimate income.       The court\ndetermined that the proffered evidence was insufficiently linked to\nthe transactions specified in the indictment and to Carucci's\ncriminal liability. Additionally, the court held that some of the\nevidence suffered from hearsay and relevance problems.          The\ngovernment's position on appeal is that the evidence that the\ndistrict court allowed in was sufficient, standing alone, to\nsupport Carucci's § 1957 convictions.\n\n                                 -14-\n\f            St.   Croix's   testimony suffers from an additional\n\nweakness: it did not indicate a time frame in which the gambling\n\nand extortion, if any, occurred.         In order to establish § 1957\n\nliability, Flemmi must have derived proceeds from gambling or\n\nextortion   before   November   22,   1992,   the   last   date   money   was\n\ndeposited into the accounts on which the transactions at issue were\n\ndrawn.   See Mankarious, 151 F.3d at 704 (\"A money launderer must\n\nobtain proceeds before laundering can take place.\"); United States\n\nv. Christo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"72523\"><a href=\"/opinion/72523/united-states-v-christo/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 580 (11th Cir. 1997) (same).\n\n            After careful consideration of the record, we conclude\n\nthat there was insufficient evidence for a rational jury to find\n\nthat Flemmi derived proceeds from gambling or extortion before\n\nNovember 22, 1992.       The gambling SUA, as the district court\n\ninstructed, required proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Flemmi\n\nconducted a gambling business that (1) violated Massachusetts law;\n\n(2) was knowingly and intentionally conducted, financed, managed,\n\nsupervised, directed or owned by five or more persons; and (3)\n\nwhich was either in substantially continuous operation for thirty\n\nor more days or had a gross revenue of $2000 or more on any single\n\nday.   See 18 U.S.C. § 1955.    Even if the jury could have reasonably\n\ninferred a violation of Massachusetts law, there was no evidence\n\npresented to the jury as to the second or third elements required\n\nfor the specified federal gambling crime.             Moreover, the term\n\n\"gambling\" is possessed of common meanings apart from the legal\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fdefinition.   See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 932\n\n(1986).   Even if the jury believed that Flemmi was involved with\n\n\"gambling,\" we cannot presume that it found that all of the\n\nelements of § 1955 were satisfied.\n\n          As to extortion, the SUA required the government to prove\n\nthat (1) Flemmi knowingly and willfully obtained property from the\n\nvictim by means of extortion; (2) Flemmi knew that the victim\n\nparted with property because of extortion; and (3) the extortion\n\naffected interstate commerce.6     18 U.S.C. § 1951.      Again, no\n\nevidence was presented to the jury as to these elements.    As with\n\ngambling, St. Croix's equivocal identification of Flemmi with only\n\n\"some\" of his own criminal activities fell short of indicating that\n\n\"extortion\" was one of them.    Furthermore, even if the jury could\n\nreasonably surmise from St. Croix's use of the terms \"gambling\" and\n\n\"extortion\" that Flemmi's conduct satisfied the statutory elements\n\nof those offenses, there is no evidence linking it to the relevant\n\naccounts during the relevant time period in the relevant amount.\n\n          As to the SUA of drug trafficking, the government points\n\nto two pieces of evidence purporting to link Flemmi to drug\n\ntrafficking proceeds.    First, St. Croix testified that a drug\n\ndealer named Johnny Debs agreed to purchase $100,000 of cocaine\n\nfrom him in the late 1980s.   He stated that Debs knew nothing about\n\n\n\n     6\n      It appears to be undisputed that it is Flemmi's criminal\nconduct that is at issue for purposes of § 1957, not St. Croix's.\n\n                                -16-\n\fSt. Croix, but approached him because of Flemmi’s reputation as a\n\nnarcotics dealer.       Second, St. Croix testified that he took drugs\n\nfrom dealers whom he promised to pay after selling the drugs.            He\n\ndid not intend to repay the dealers, however, and said he instead\n\n\"would divvy it up with people that I was involved in and later my\n\nfather.” (It is not entirely clear from the testimony whether this\n\nscheme was merely a plan, or whether the \"divvying\" in fact took\n\nplace.)     St. Croix also testified that he was involved in drug\n\ntrafficking from 1989 to 1997.\n\n            Assuming without deciding that this evidence shows that\n\nFlemmi engaged in drug trafficking, it falls short of establishing\n\nthat the funds used in the real estate transactions were actually\n\nderived from drug funds as opposed to other criminally-derived\n\nproceeds.    As with gambling and extortion, there is no evidence as\n\nto the amount of proceeds or the specific time frame in which the\n\nproceeds were conveyed to Flemmi.       Indeed, the fact that St. Croix\n\nspecified that any sharing with Flemmi happened \"later\" suggests\n\nthat Flemmi was unlikely to have derived drug-trafficking proceeds\n\nbefore the 1992 transaction.          Accordingly, to infer from this\n\ntestimony that at least $10,000 of the funds involved in the real\n\nestate    transaction    in   1992   were   derived   from   Flemmi's   drug\n\ntrafficking is too great a stretch.\n\n            The government points to evidence of Flemmi's leadership\n\nof an organized crime gang and apparent lack of legitimate income\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fto support the SUAs.      It argues that the testimony that Flemmi was\n\na leader of the Winter Hill Gang \"told the jury much about Flemmi\n\nand his money.\"7      The government also points to the fact that\n\nFlemmi's parents had meager incomes and lived frugally, and hence\n\ncould not have provided any money to Flemmi for the purchase.\n\n             While these factors certainly suggest criminally derived\n\nincome in a general sense, the evidence fails to supply a link to\n\ngambling, extortion or drug trafficking specifically.                 Accepting\n\nthat Flemmi's income was illegitimate, it could have been linked to\n\nany number of criminal activities; to conclude from this evidence\n\nthat Flemmi derived proceeds from the specified SUAs is simply too\n\nspeculative.\n\n             Moreover, a § 1957 conviction cannot be based solely on\n\nthe finding that a known criminal had no other legitimate income.\n\nBlackman, 904 F.2d at 1257.       In the cases cited by the government,\n\ncourts generally affirm money-laundering convictions only where\n\nsuch evidence is accompanied by additional, more specific indicia\n\nof criminal activity.

Again, this evidence does not\n\nestablish a sufficient nexus to the specified SUAs.                          While it is\n\ntrue that a suspiciously structured financial transaction can\n\nconstitute circumstantial evidence of money-laundering, the cases\n\ncited by the government consistently feature additional evidence of\n\nunlawful activity.            See, e.g., United States v.

While Flemmi's apparent lack of legitimate\n\nincome and the structuring of his financial dealings certainly\n\nsuggest criminal activity, the government failed to prove a nexus\n\nto the alleged specified unlawful activity, much less to the\n\naccounts   involved   in    the   transactions   at   issue.    Carucci's\n\nconvictions on counts 73 and 75 cannot stand.8\n\nB.         The government's cross-appeal\n\n           We now turn to the government's cross-appeal.              The\n\ngovernment contends that the district court erred in allowing\n\nCarucci's motion for acquittal on counts 70 through 72 and 74,\n\nwhich set forth additional violations of § 1957.               (Counts 70\n\nthrough 72 related to the purchase of the laundry equipment; count\n\n74 related to the purchase of the condominium.)        As grounds for its\n\ndecision, the district court stated that there was insufficient\n\nevidence to establish that Carucci knew that the property involved\n\nin the transactions had been derived from criminal activity.\n\n           As noted supra, we review Rule 29 determinations de novo.\n\nCounts 70-72 and 74 are fatally undermined by the government's\n\nfailure of proof as to § 1957's requirement that the transactions\n\n\n     8\n      Accordingly, we need not deal with the other issues Carucci\nraises on appeal, including the adequacy of the jury instructions.\n\n                                   -20-\n\fat   issue   were   derived   from   specified    unlawful   activity.      As\n\ndiscussed    supra,   no   reasonable   jury     could   conclude   that   the\n\npurchases of the equipment or condominium involved proceeds from\n\nFlemmi's gambling, extortion, or drug trafficking. Accordingly, we\n\naffirm the district court's grant of Carucci's Rule 29 motion,\n\nalbeit on different grounds.9\n\n                              III. CONCLUSION\n\n             For the reasons set forth above, we reverse Carucci's\n\nconvictions on counts 73 and 75 of the indictment and affirm the\n\ndistrict court's judgments of acquittal on counts 70-72 and 74.\n\n\n\n\n      9\n      As a result of this holding, we need not address the district\ncourt's award of a conditional new trial should the Rule 29 rulings\nbe reversed. Nor do we address the sentencing issue raised by the\ngovernment.\n\n                                     -21-\n\f</pre>",
