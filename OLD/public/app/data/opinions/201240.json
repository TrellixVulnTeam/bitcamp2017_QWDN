Abramian\n\n(\"Abramian\"), a native and citizen of the former Union of Soviet\n\nSocialist Republics (\"USSR\"), seeks judicial review of a final\n\norder of deportation.     For the following reasons, the petition is\n\ndenied.\n\n           Abramian's claims that the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") acted\n\n\"irrationally\" during his hearing, was not impartial and should\n\nhave been disqualified for having a personal interest in the case,\n\nand erred in not finding him \"stateless\" are all waived because\n\nAbramian   did   not   raise   them    in    his   appeal   to   the   Board   of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\").          \"Issues not raised before the Board\n\nmay not be raised for the first time upon judicial review of the\n\nBoard's decisions.\"     Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 761 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).1\n\n           Each of these claims lacks merit in any event.                First,\n\nthe IJ's remark that the immigration hearing was not a \"forum for\n\na civil suit\" was not directed toward Abramian's immigration case,\n\nbut, rather, toward his employment discrimination case against\n\n\n     1\n\n      Since the deportation proceedings were initiated before\n 4/1/97 and the final order of deportation was issued after\n 10/31/96, this petition is governed by the transitional rules\n for judicial review set forth in IIRIRA § 309(c)(4) and former\n INA § 106, 8 U.S.C. § 1105a. Bernal-Vallejo v. INS, 195 F.3d\n 56, 61 (1st Cir. 1999). Pursuant to former INA § 106(c), \"[a]n\n order of deportation or of exclusion shall not be reviewed by\n any court if the alien has not exhausted the administrative\n remedies available to him as of right under the immigration\n laws and regulations.\"\n\n                                       -2-\n\fHarvard University.     The IJ made the comment after Abramian's\n\ncounsel had questioned Abramian at some length about the Harvard\n\nlawsuit.   Rather than act irrationally, the IJ properly cut off\n\ntestimony that was cumulative and not pertinent.                Laurent v.\n\nAshcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 62-63 (1st Cir. 2004).           Second, the IJ's\n\nreview of Abramian's asylum claim was proper because it was made in\n\nlight of changed country conditions and a change in the country of\n\ndeportation.     Cf.    8   U.S.C.      §   1101(a)(42)(A)      (requiring\n\ncountry-specific showings for asylum relief).           Third, Abramian's\n\nallegation that the IJ had the bomb squad investigate an envelope\n\nfrom the Boston Herald has no support in the record.               Fourth,\n\nAbramian has   not   presented   any    evidence   of   bias   beyond   mere\n\nconjecture, nor does the record suggest any partiality.           Finally,\n\nAbramian's desire to remain in the United States rather than be\n\ndeported to any other country does not render him stateless.            Nor\n\nis he rendered stateless by his failure to apply for citizenship\n\nthat is available to him.    E.g., Oboroznaya v. INS, 168 F.3d 500,\n\n1998 WL 879709, *2 (9th Cir. 1998) (unpublished) (holding that BIA\n\nproperly rejected stateless claim where petitioner was entitled to\n\nreturn to former Soviet country and obtain citizenship); see also\n\nKovalev v. Ashcroft, 223 F. Supp.2d 688, 692 & n.3 (E.D. Pa. 2002)\n\n(rejecting stateless claim in habeas motion where petitioner was\n\neligible to apply for Russian citizenship).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f            With respect to Abramian's claim that the IJ erred in\n\ndenying his application for suspension of deportation based on\n\nfailure to show extreme hardship, we lack jurisdiction to consider\n\nthat claim.      Mendes v. INS, 197 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(holding, under transitional rules, that existence of extreme\n\nhardship was determination committed to agency discretion and\n\ntherefore     unreviewable);   Bernal-Vallejo,        195     F.3d   at   63\n\n(characterizing BIA determination that alien had not demonstrated\n\nextreme hardship as unreviewable discretionary decision).\n\n            Finally, there is Abramian's claim that the IJ violated\n\nhis due process rights by not granting his counsel's request for a\n\ncontinuance to procure the testimony of an additional witness and\n\nby not allowing his counsel to present a closing argument.                We\n\nreview de novo the question of whether an administrative law\n\njudge's conduct violates due process.          Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168\n\nF.3d 565, 568 (1st Cir. 1999).       \"An immigration judge, like other\n\njudicial     officers,   possesses    broad     (though     not   uncabined)\n\ndiscretion over the conduct of trial proceedings.\"            Id.\n\n            There was no abuse of discretion here. As noted earlier,\n\njudges have considerable leeway to cut off cumulative or redundant\n\ntestimony.    Laurent, 359 F.3d at 63.        In requesting a continuance\n\nto procure the testimony of an additional witness, Abramian's\n\ncounsel stated that \"there is a woman that we've been trying to\n\nchase down at the shelter who actually was a case worker and I\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthink would testify about his, not only his moral character but the\n\nkind       of   example     he    set    in   adversity.\"       There    was   no   issue\n\nconcerning          Abramian's      moral      character.         Moreover,    Abramian\n\ntestified in detail about how, by working two jobs and continuing\n\nhis education, he made a contribution to his community by setting\n\na good example and becoming a role model to other homeless people.\n\nOther witnesses also gave evidence concerning Abramian's hard work\n\nand    educational          achievements.           The   IJ    credited    Ambramian's\n\nachievements but concluded that they were \"largely for his self-\n\nimprovement\" and did not \"constitute[] the type of contribution to\n\nthe community that [the BIA] envisioned\" to demonstrate extreme\n\nhardship.           The proposed testimony would have merely reasserted\n\ninformation          that   the     IJ   considered       and   credited     but    deemed\n\ninadequate to establish extreme hardship.2\n\n                       Nor did the IJ abuse her discretion by denying\n\nAbramian's counsel the opportunity to make a closing argument.\n\nWhile it may be better practice for an IJ to allow each party to\n\npresent         a   closing      argument,     Abramian    does    not     identify    any\n\nprejudice resulting from his lack of an opportunity to do so,\n\narguing only generally that a closing argument \"would have helped\n\n\n       2\n\n      Abramian also failed to name this witness, indicate how\n long he believed it would take to find her and secure her\n testimony, or make a specific proffer of her testimony. Thus,\n there is no evidence that Abramian could have found and\n produced this witness, even if he had been granted a\n continuance.\n\n                                              -5-\n\fthe court to understand the significance of the evidence presented\n\n. . . and its relevance to the elements of his case.\" There is\n\nnothing in the record to indicate that the IJ did not fully\n\nunderstand the significance of the evidence presented.   Rather, it\n\nappears that the IJ understood the evidence but did not believe\n\nthat it warranted relief.   E.g., Yap v. INS, 318 F.2d 839, 841 (7th\n\nCir. 1963) (holding that IJ did not abuse discretion by failing to\n\ngrant closing argument where \"oral argument could have added\n\nnothing\"); see also Castellano-Chacon v. INS, 341 F.3d 533, 553\n\n(6th Cir. 2003) (holding that alien's contentions that he had no\n\nopportunity to present case in concise narrative form, to argue the\n\nlaw, or to hear his chosen advocate plead for his life did not\n\nestablish prejudice).\n\n          The petition for review is denied.
