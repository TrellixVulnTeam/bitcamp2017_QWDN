Saavedra Castro with whom Manuel Correa Márquez, Xana\nConnelly, Correa, Collazo & Herrero, P.S.C., Carlos E. Montañez and\nCarlos E. Montañez Law Office were on brief for appellants.\n     Mark A.

Plaintiffs, who operated gas\n\nstations as franchisees of Esso Standard Oil Co. (\"Esso\") in Puerto\n\nRico, sued Esso for alleged violations of Title I of the Petroleum\n\nMarketing Practices Act (\"PMPA\"), 15 U.S.C. §§ 2801-2807 (2006 &\n\nSupp. III 2010).       The magistrate judge, who presided at trial with\n\nthe parties' consent, see 28 U.S.C. § 636(c)(1) (2006), denied\n\nplaintiffs'       request   for   injunctive       relief   and   damages,    and\n\nplaintiffs now appeal.         The facts are largely undisputed.\n\n               Esso operated as a supplier of gasoline in Puerto Rico\n\nfor   over     one   hundred   years;   as    of   2008,    161   stations   sold\n\nEsso-brand gasoline in Puerto Rico.            These stations were operated\n\nby independent franchise dealers under agreements with Esso that\n\nauthorized them to sell Esso's gasoline under Esso's trademark.\n\nThe franchise term was three years or longer for most plaintiffs,\n\nalthough some plaintiffs had one-year trial franchises.                 In many\n\ncases, Esso also provided the stations.1\n\n               In late 2006, Esso--having suffered losses in the market\n\nfor the five preceding years--began to consider leaving Puerto\n\nRico.       After months of deliberation and negotiations, Esso decided\n\nin March 2008 to sell its operations and assets to Total Petroleum\n\nPuerto Rico Corp. (\"Total\"), a gasoline refiner and distributor\n\n\n        1\n      About a third of the franchises owned their own land and\nstations outright, while two-thirds leased their stations from Esso\nas part of the franchise agreement. This latter group leased the\nland and premises to Esso and Esso leased it back to them as part\nof the franchise agreement.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthat at the time operated approximately ninety stations in Puerto\n\nRico.   On March 17, 2008, Esso notified its franchisees of its\n\nplanned withdrawal from the Puerto Rican market, the sale of its\n\nassets to Total, and the termination of its relationship with its\n\nfranchisees, effective September 30, 2008.\n\n            In late June and early July 2008, Total began to offer\n\nEsso's franchisees contracts to serve as franchisees of Total.\n\nTotal uses a standard franchise model contract offered to potential\n\nnew franchisees and to existing franchisees whose contracts are\n\nrenewed.    The standard contract is periodically updated, and had\n\nbeen updated in 2007 and 2008; Total offered the then-current\n\nstandard contract to Esso franchisees.\n\n            In late August and early September 2008, five groups of\n\nEsso franchisees, unhappy with the terms Total offered in its\n\nfranchise   agreements,   filed   separate   lawsuits   in   the   federal\n\ndistrict court in Puerto Rico against Esso.      The complaints sought\n\ninjunctive and declaratory relief under PMPA to prevent Esso from\n\nterminating its contracts with plaintiffs, as well as damages for\n\nEsso's alleged failure to comply with PMPA.      Esso then pushed back\n\nthe termination date of its contracts to the end of October 2008.\n\n            The district court consolidated the lawsuits and referred\n\nthe cases to the chief magistrate judge, and the parties consented\n\nto a bench trial before the magistrate judge.            Three days of\n\nhearings were held and ultimately the magistrate judge issued three\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fopinions.2     In the first, on October 18, 2008, he concluded that\n\nEsso had complied with PMPA and denied plaintiffs' request for\n\ninjunctive relief.     Santiago-Sepúlveda I, 582 F. Supp. 2d at 185.\n\n             All but two of the plaintiffs eventually agreed to accept\n\nfranchise agreements offered by Total.            In a second opinion, on\n\nJune 23, 2009, the magistrate judge reaffirmed that Esso's actions\n\nhad complied with PMPA, but, explaining that the question remained\n\nwhether   the    individual   contract    terms    in   Total's   franchise\n\nagreement complied with PMPA, he proceeded to find three specific\n\nterms illegal under local law but severable under the franchise\n\ncontract's severability clause.          Santiago-Sepúlveda II, 634 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 211-12.\n\n             Finally, on reconsideration, the magistrate judge issued\n\nhis third opinion on July 30, 2009.       In it, he reaffirmed that the\n\nterms found illegal in the previous opinion were severable and held\n\nthat two more terms were unenforceable under Puerto Rico law.\n\nSantiago-Sepúlveda III, 638 F. Supp. 2d at 200, 204-05.                 He\n\nthereafter entered a final judgment in favor of Esso and Total\n\n(which had intervened to defend its franchise contract and its\n\nacquisition of Esso's properties).\n\n\n     2\n      Santiago-Sepúlveda v. Esso Standard Oil Co. (P.R.) (Santiago-\nSepúlveda I), 582 F. Supp. 2d 154 (D.P.R. 2008), vacated in part,\nNo. 08-1950, 2009 WL 87586 (D.P.R. Jan. 12, 2009); Santiago-\nSepulveda v. Esso Standard Oil Co. (P.R.) (Santiago-Sepúlveda II),\n634 F. Supp. 2d 201 (D.P.R. 2009); Santiago-Sepúlveda v. Esso\nStandard Oil Co. (P.R.) (Santiago-Sepúlveda III), 638 F. Supp. 2d\n193 (D.P.R. 2009).\n\n                                   -5-\n\f             Appeals, by several contingents of plaintiffs, followed.\n\nWe review factual findings made in the bench trial for clear error,\n\nMonahan v. Romney, 625 F.3d 42, 46 (1st Cir. 2010); denials of an\n\ninjunction for abuse of discretion, García-Rubiera v. Calderón, 570\n\nF.3d 443, 455-56 (1st Cir. 2009); and rulings on purely legal\n\nissues de novo, id. at 456.    Because the framework for the judgment\n\nunder review is provided by PMPA, the first step is to outline the\n\nrelevant elements of the statute.\n\n             PMPA is a conventional dealer-protection statute limiting\n\nthe circumstances in which a motor fuel franchisor can terminate or\n\nchoose not to renew a franchise relationship.         See Chestnut Hill\n\nGulf, Inc. v. Cumberland Farms, Inc., 940 F.2d 744, 746 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).     This statute, like most others at both the federal and the\n\nstate level, rests on the perceived \"disparity of bargaining power\n\nbetween franchisor and franchisee,\" Veracka v. Shell Oil Co., 655\n\nF.2d 445, 448 (1st Cir. 1981) (Breyer, J.), coupled with concerns\n\nsaid to be peculiar to franchising, Draeger Oil Co. v. Uno-Ven Co.,\n\n314 F.3d 299, 299 (7th Cir. 2002) (Posner, J.); see 123 Cong. Rec.\n\n10,386 (1977) (statement of Rep. Mikva).\n\n             Under PMPA, a franchisor may terminate the relationship\n\non   any    of   five   specified   grounds,   15   U.S.C.   §   2802(a),\n\n(b)(2)(A)-(E), and the one pertinent here--subsection (E)--permits\n\ntermination if a franchisor determines\n\n             in good faith and in the normal course of\n             business to withdraw from the marketing of\n\n                                    -6-\n\f          motor fuel through retail outlets in the\n          relevant geographic market area in which the\n          marketing premises are located.\n\nThere are other restrictions and requirements, such as proper\n\nadvance notice, id. §§ 2802(b)(1)(A), 2804(b)(2), but they are not\n\nat issue on this appeal.\n\n          However, for withdrawals under subsection (E), there are\n\nfurther conditions, 15 U.S.C. § 2802(b)(2)(E)(iii), specifying\n\nalternative means to preserve the franchisee's operations; the\n\nstatutory alternative chosen by Esso here allowed it to sell the\n\npremises it leased to its dealers to another franchisor, so long as\n\nthe purchasing franchisor-to-be\n\n          offers, in good faith, a franchise to the\n          franchisee on terms and conditions which are\n          not discriminatory to the franchisee as\n          compared to franchises then currently being\n          offered by such other person or franchises\n          then in effect and with respect to which such\n          other person is the franchisor.\n\nId. § 2802(b)(2)(E)(iii)(II).     Whether this condition applies to\n\nall of the dealers in this case is an open question but, given our\n\ndisposition, need not be resolved.3\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      The condition applies only to franchisees that occupy \"leased\nmarketing premises,\" id. § 2802(b)(2)(E)(iii), and whether it\napplies to those who own their premises but engaged in a double\nlease arrangement (see note 1, above) is an open question. Compare\nid. § 2801(1)(B)(i), 2801(9), with Barman v. Union Oil Co. of Cal.,\n50 F. App'x 824, 829 (9th Cir. 2002) (unpublished). Further, by\nits terms section 2802(b)(2)(E) is limited to franchise terms that\nare three years or longer.\n\n                                  -7-\n\f            If a franchisor terminates the franchise relationship but\n\nfails to comply with these requirements, its franchisees can sue it\n\nfor equitable relief, actual and exemplary damages, and attorney\n\nand expert witness fees.        15 U.S.C. § 2805(a), (b), (d).         When the\n\nfact of termination is proved by the franchisee (and it is conceded\n\nhere), the burden falls on the franchisor to establish \"that such\n\ntermination or nonrenewal was permitted\" by PMPA.              Id. § 2805(c).\n\n            Plaintiffs' first substantive contention is that Esso did\n\nnot comply with section 2802(b)(2)(E)(iii)(II) because (allegedly)\n\nTotal did not offer the former Esso dealers \"franchise[s] . . . on\n\nterms and conditions which are not discriminatory to the franchisee\n\nas compared to franchises then currently being offered by [Total]\n\nor franchises then in effect and with respect to which [Total] is\n\nthe   franchisor.\"       15   U.S.C.    §    2802(b)(2)(E)(iii)(II).      In   a\n\nnutshell,    plaintiffs       allege    on    appeal   that   different   Esso\n\nfranchisees were offered different contracts by Total.\n\n            For example, plaintiffs say that Total required some to\n\noperate a convenience store, while others were not required to do\n\nso, and those operating convenience stores also had to sign non-\n\ncompete agreements, while others did not.              They also allege that\n\nTotal   included     a   term   in     the    franchise   agreement--personal\n\nsupervision by the franchisee--that would make those franchisees\n\nthat operate multiple stations in default (an interpretation that\n\nTotal's marketing director denied in his own testimony).\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f            Although plaintiffs made a discrimination claim below, it\n\nwas different from those urged on appeal.              The argument made to the\n\nmagistrate judge was that the franchises offered to them were\n\ndifferent    than      the    ones    Total      offered     to     its    preexisting\n\nfranchisees, not that the terms offered to former Esso dealers\n\ndiffered from each other.            Absent plain error, which was not even\n\nasserted on this issue, a claim not presented in the lower court is\n\nnot available on appeal.           Bennett v. City of Holyoke, 362 F.3d 1,\n\n6 (1st Cir. 2004); Beddall v. State St. Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d\n\n12, 22 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            As   it     happens,       \"Congress      did         not     intend       'not\n\ndiscriminatory' to mean that each service station operator must be\n\noffered a franchise with identical terms.                   A franchisor must be\n\nfree to offer different terms at different franchise locations,\n\ndepending on the economic conditions and forecast for that area.\"\n\nEwing v. Amoco Oil Co., 823 F.2d 1432, 1438 (10th Cir. 1987).\n\nThus, to employ additional terms for franchisees with convenience\n\nstores on the premises could well be legitimate so long as all of\n\nTotal's franchisees in this situation were offered similar terms.\n\nBut we need not pursue the subject.\n\n            Plaintiffs'        next    claim     is   that    Total's          offer    of\n\nfranchises       was         not     \"in      good    faith,\"             as     section\n\n2802(b)(2)(E)(iii)(II) requires, because the magistrate judge found\n\nthat some terms in the franchise contract violated state law and\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fstruck the offending provisions.                     This claim raises questions not\n\nonly     as    to        the     meaning        of     \"good      faith\"     in     section\n\n2802(b)(2)(E)(iii)(II), but also the relationship between this\n\nprovision and other sections in PMPA that relate to the statute's\n\ninteraction with state law.                15 U.S.C. §§ 2805(f)(1)(B), 2806(a).\n\n              \"Good faith\" usually refers to a subjective intent or\n\nmotive    that      is    legitimate        rather       than    consciously      evil   or\n\ndishonest. Esso Standard Oil Co. (P.R.) v. Monroig-Zayas, 445 F.3d\n\n13, 18 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Esso Standard Oil Co. v. Dep't of\n\nConsumer Affairs, 793 F.2d 431, 432 (1st Cir. 1986)) (construing\n\nsection 2802(b)(3)(A)).             But just what must be done in good faith\n\nby the new franchisor is less certain; and the phrase could be read\n\nmerely to afford some protection to the new franchisor in making an\n\noffer that it honestly believed to be non-discriminatory.\n\n              Indeed,          Congress    emphasized           that   the   good    faith\n\nrequirement aimed only to protect franchisees from \"arbitrary or\n\ndiscriminatory\"          behavior,        but    otherwise        to   \"avoid     judicial\n\nscrutiny\"     of    the        reasoning    behind       the     franchisor's     business\n\njudgments.       S. Rep. No. 95-731, at 37 (1978), reprinted in 1978\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 873, 896. But the requirement could as easily be read\n\ninstead,       or        as      well,      to        afford      further       franchisee\n\nprotection--pertinently, by disallowing an offer that might be non-\n\ndiscriminatory but was structured to be unacceptable and intended\n\nto provoke refusal.\n\n\n                                            -10-\n\f           A number of courts have construed the term in the latter\n\nsense, and while the issue has not been adequately briefed, we will\n\nassume for present purposes that such an offer would not be in good\n\nfaith.4   This might seem hard on the departing franchisor who alone\n\ncan be sued under PMPA and may have no easy way to judge the\n\nsubjective good faith of its successor; but the statute does aim to\n\nkeep the former franchisees in business and the sale of a business\n\ninvolves various risks and there are various means for the seller\n\nto protect against them.\n\n           However, no evidence suggests that Total devised the\n\nfranchise agreements in the hope that they would be rejected.         The\n\nmagistrate   judge   found   several    provisions   of   the   franchise\n\nagreement unlawful under Puerto Rico law; but Total, even assuming\n\nit shared that view, could easily have believed that the agreements\n\nwould be accepted by franchisees, old and new.            The franchise\n\nagreement was Total's standard model for renewing franchises for\n\nits own dealers, and it was buying out Esso to expand its business.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      See, e.g., Unocal Corp. v. Kaabipour, 177 F.3d 755, 767 (9th\nCir. 1999) (good faith requirement looks in part to whether terms\nare used \"'as a pretext to avoid renewal'\" (quoting Valentine v.\nMobil Oil Corp., 789 F.2d 1388, 1392 (9th Cir. 1986))); May-Som\nGulf, Inc. v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 869 F.2d 917, 927 (6th Cir.\n1989) (incoming franchisor found to act in good faith where its\nactions demonstrated that it was \"committed to timely renewal of\nthe plaintiffs'\" contracts, and there was no evidence that it,\namong other things, \"drastically increased [the plaintiffs']\nrents\").\n\n                                 -11-\n\f               Indeed, the magistrate judge found no evidence indicating\n\nthat \"the Total franchise agreements [were intended] to force any\n\nfranchisee to reject the proposal.\"        Santiago-Sepúlveda I, 582 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 182.       And when the magistrate judge said that certain\n\nprovisions were unenforceable and struck them, Total went along\n\nwith the court and has not cross appealed.       So we see no basis for\n\nsuggesting that Total intended that its offer be rejected, and\n\nplaintiffs point to nothing that would support such an inference.\n\n               Instead, plaintiffs argue that any term violating state\n\nlaw       in   any   respect   comprises   a   violation   of   section\n\n2802(b)(2)(E)(iii)(II). For this position they rely on a statement\n\nin a House Report that if\n\n               a franchisor proposed a provision in a\n               franchise agreement at the time of renewal\n               which    was    expressly    prohibited   or\n               unenforceable under State law, such change\n               could not be considered to have been made in\n               \"good   faith\"   within    the   meaning  of\n               102(b)(3)(A) [15 U.S.C. § 2802(b)(3)(A)].\n\nH.R.

Franchising contracts commonly cover a wide\n\nrange of subjects, including clauses \"pertaining to nearly every\n\ndetail    of   operation\"   of   the   franchised        business.    Hadfield,\n\nProblematic    Relations:   Franchising     and    the    Law   of   Incomplete\n\nContracts, 42 Stan. L. Rev. 927, 943 (1990).               Total's franchise\n\nagreement, comprising interrelated contracts spanning about one\n\nhundred    pages,   included     hundreds   of     clauses--of       which   the\n\nmagistrate judge invalidated in part just five.\n\n            Congress did make clear that, save where PMPA regulates\n\ntermination and renewal and so bars inconsistent state law, state\n\nlaw is not superceded, 15 U.S.C. § 2806(a), and it provided that a\n\nfranchisor could not require as a condition of entering into or\n\nrenewing a franchise a \"release or waive[r]\" of a federal right or\n\n\"any right that the franchisee may have under any valid and\n\napplicable State law,\" id. § 2805(f).            But the primary effect of\n\nthese reservations is to leave franchisees free to bring private\n\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fsuits in state court to invalidate franchise provisions that are\n\ninconsistent with state law.\n\n              As the Supreme Court recently explained:\n\n              In enacting the PMPA, Congress did not\n              regulate every aspect of the petroleum\n              franchise relationship but instead federalized\n              only the two parts of that relationship with\n              which it was most concerned: the circumstances\n              in which franchisors may terminate a franchise\n              or decline to renew a franchise relationship.\n              Congress left undisturbed state-law regulation\n              of other types of disputes between petroleum\n              franchisors and franchisees.\n\nMac's Shell Serv., Inc. v. Shell Oil Prods. Co., 130 S. Ct. 1251,\n\n1259 (2010) (citations omitted).               Nothing in PMPA purports to\n\ncreate    a    separate   federal   cause      of   action    to   remedy     such\n\nviolations;      the   civil   remedy    provisions   of     section   2805    are\n\nexplicitly limited to violations of three other specified sections\n\nincluding section 2802.         15 U.S.C. § 2805(a), (b), (d); Dersch\n\nEnergies, Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., 314 F.3d 846, 857 (7th Cir. 2002).\n\n              This does not fully answer the question whether a state\n\nlaw violation could ever serve to defeat a good faith offer under\n\nsection       2802(b)(2)(E)(iii)(II);      but it suggests that the \"good\n\nfaith\" test is not failed merely because a couple of terms in a\n\ncomplex contract are at odds with state contract or franchise law,\n\nitself often no model of clarity.6             Violations so harmful to the\n\n     6\n      Mac's Shell pointed out that construing the PMPA to cover\n\"'run-of-the-mill' franchise disputes\" would have \"serious\nimplications\" and, because PMPA requires attorney and expert\nwitness fees and permits punitive damages,\"turn everyday contract\ndisputes into high-stakes affairs.\" 130 S. Ct. at 1260 n.7.\n\n                                        -14-\n\fcore franchise bargain as to invite rejection might be evidence of\n\nan intent to cause rejection; but nothing like that is present\n\nhere.\n\n           Plaintiffs next argue that the entire franchise contract\n\nis invalid under state law, and so Total never in fact made an\n\n\"offer[]\" of \"a franchise to the franchisee[s]\" under section\n\n2802(b)(2)(E)(iii)(II).      The   underlying   argument   is   that   the\n\ncontract could not be saved by deleting specific clauses because\n\nthose provisions were not severable from the contract and so the\n\nentire contract is invalid.        However, the contracts include a\n\n\"Severance of Clauses\" provision that reads in pertinent part as\n\nfollows:\n\n           [S]hould any provision in this Contract be\n           found    to   be    unlawful,   invalid,    or\n           unenforceable under present or future laws,\n           said provisions shall be nullified; this\n           Contract shall be interpreted and governed as\n           if said unlawful, invalid or unenforceable\n           provision had never been a part thereof, and\n           the rest of the provisions in this Contract\n           shall remain in force and will not be affected\n           by the unlawful, invalid or unenforceable\n           provision or its elimination.\n\n           The franchise agreements are largely governed by Puerto\n\nRico law and such severance is permissible under Puerto Rico law.\n\nE.g., McCrillis v. Autoridad de las Navieras de P.R., 23 P.R.\n\nOffic. Trans. 109, 132-33 (P.R. 1989) (\"[T]he parties, by mutual\n\nagreement, stipulated the partial conservation of the contract.\n\nThere is no protected social interest that bars this solution.\"\n\n(footnote omitted)).      Nor, as plaintiffs' mistakenly claim, is\n\n                                   -15-\n\fseverance equivalent to \"reformation,\" 27 R. Lord, Williston on\n\nContracts § 70:19 (4th ed. 2003), so the conditions for reformation\n\nare beside the point.\n\n              Plaintiffs also say that any terms inconsistent with\n\nPuerto Rico law amount to a required waiver or release of state law\n\nrights forbidden by section 2805(f)(1) and that, as they have not\n\nbeen paid separately for such a waiver or release, the contract\n\nfails for want of consideration.          Congress was apparently willing\n\nto allow such waivers or releases if compensated, H.R. Rep. No.\n\n103-737, at 6 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2782; S.\n\nRep. No. 103-387, at 4 (1994), but the terms found invalid were\n\nvoided   by    the   magistrate   judge    and   so   could   hardly   justify\n\ncompensation.\n\n              As the last of their substantive claims, plaintiffs say\n\nthat the magistrate judge should have invalidated, under 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2805(f)(1), still other provisions of the contract as violations\n\nof   state    law--for   example,   a    non-compete    clause   relating   to\n\nconvenience store operations.           No request for their invalidation\n\nwas made until plaintiffs' reply brief and so they are barred on\n\nthis appeal,     Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 354\n\n(1st Cir. 1992), but plaintiffs may pursue whatever remedies they\n\nretain under state law.\n\n              Plaintiffs also make a single procedural claim, namely,\n\nthat the magistrate judge misstated the burden of proof at several\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fpoints in his decision.     The statute, as already noted, says that\n\nthe plaintiff must show termination and the defendant must then\n\nshow that the conditions permitting termination were met.               15\n\nU.S.C. § 2805(c).      The magistrate judge's statements are arguably\n\ninconsistent with one another, recognizing at one point that the\n\nburden was on the defendant and at other points suggesting that\n\nplaintiffs had failed to offer evidence on specific issues.\n\n            Confusion can easily occur because a defendant often\n\ncannot know what the objection is until one is identified by the\n\nplaintiff, and a lack of evidence from the party not bearing the\n\nburden of proof can bear on whether there is an issue to be\n\nresolved.    In all events, the preserved arguments that we have\n\nconsidered do not turn on who bears the burden of proof, and there\n\nis no indication that the magistrate judge's statements affected\n\nthe outcome.    See In re LaFata, 483 F.3d 13, 23 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            Finally,   plaintiffs   seek   damages   and   attorney   fees.\n\nUnder 15 U.S.C. § 2805(d)(1), these are allowed to plaintiffs who\n\nprove a violation of sections 2802, 2803 or 2807, but, as we\n\nexplained above, plaintiffs failed to prove any such violation.\n\nAlthough the magistrate judge sided with plaintiffs on their\n\nsection 2805(f) claims, PMPA--which provides no express remedies to\n\nplaintiffs for such violations, id. § 2805(a), (d)--assuredly does\n\nnot provide damages or fees for state law violations standing\n\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\falone, so the magistrate judge correctly refused to award damages\n\nor fees.\n\n           The judgment of the court below is affirmed.   Each side\n\nwill bear its own costs on this appeal.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -18-\n\f",

Plaintiffs, who operated gas\n\nstations as franchisees of Esso Standard Oil Co. (\"Esso\") in Puerto\n\nRico, sued Esso for alleged violations of Title I of the Petroleum\n\nMarketing Practices Act (\"PMPA\"), 15 U.S.C. §§ 2801-2807 (2006 &\n\nSupp. III 2010).       The magistrate judge, who presided at trial with\n\nthe parties' consent, see 28 U.S.C. § 636(c)(1) (2006), denied\n\nplaintiffs'       request   for   injunctive       relief   and   damages,    and\n\nplaintiffs now appeal.         The facts are largely undisputed.\n\n               Esso operated as a supplier of gasoline in Puerto Rico\n\nfor   over     one   hundred   years;   as    of   2008,    161   stations   sold\n\nEsso-brand gasoline in Puerto Rico.            These stations were operated\n\nby independent franchise dealers under agreements with Esso that\n\nauthorized them to sell Esso's gasoline under Esso's trademark.\n\nThe franchise term was three years or longer for most plaintiffs,\n\nalthough some plaintiffs had one-year trial franchises.                 In many\n\ncases, Esso also provided the stations.1\n\n               In late 2006, Esso--having suffered losses in the market\n\nfor the five preceding years--began to consider leaving Puerto\n\nRico.       After months of deliberation and negotiations, Esso decided\n\nin March 2008 to sell its operations and assets to Total Petroleum\n\nPuerto Rico Corp. (\"Total\"), a gasoline refiner and distributor\n\n\n        1\n      About a third of the franchises owned their own land and\nstations outright, while two-thirds leased their stations from Esso\nas part of the franchise agreement. This latter group leased the\nland and premises to Esso and Esso leased it back to them as part\nof the franchise agreement.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthat at the time operated approximately ninety stations in Puerto\n\nRico.   On March 17, 2008, Esso notified its franchisees of its\n\nplanned withdrawal from the Puerto Rican market, the sale of its\n\nassets to Total, and the termination of its relationship with its\n\nfranchisees, effective September 30, 2008.\n\n            In late June and early July 2008, Total began to offer\n\nEsso's franchisees contracts to serve as franchisees of Total.\n\nTotal uses a standard franchise model contract offered to potential\n\nnew franchisees and to existing franchisees whose contracts are\n\nrenewed.    The standard contract is periodically updated, and had\n\nbeen updated in 2007 and 2008; Total offered the then-current\n\nstandard contract to Esso franchisees.\n\n            In late August and early September 2008, five groups of\n\nEsso franchisees, unhappy with the terms Total offered in its\n\nfranchise   agreements,   filed   separate   lawsuits   in   the   federal\n\ndistrict court in Puerto Rico against Esso.      The complaints sought\n\ninjunctive and declaratory relief under PMPA to prevent Esso from\n\nterminating its contracts with plaintiffs, as well as damages for\n\nEsso's alleged failure to comply with PMPA.      Esso then pushed back\n\nthe termination date of its contracts to the end of October 2008.\n\n            The district court consolidated the lawsuits and referred\n\nthe cases to the chief magistrate judge, and the parties consented\n\nto a bench trial before the magistrate judge.            Three days of\n\nhearings were held and ultimately the magistrate judge issued three\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fopinions.2     In the first, on October 18, 2008, he concluded that\n\nEsso had complied with PMPA and denied plaintiffs' request for\n\ninjunctive relief.     Santiago-Sepúlveda I, 582 F. Supp. 2d at 185.\n\n             All but two of the plaintiffs eventually agreed to accept\n\nfranchise agreements offered by Total.            In a second opinion, on\n\nJune 23, 2009, the magistrate judge reaffirmed that Esso's actions\n\nhad complied with PMPA, but, explaining that the question remained\n\nwhether   the    individual   contract    terms    in   Total's   franchise\n\nagreement complied with PMPA, he proceeded to find three specific\n\nterms illegal under local law but severable under the franchise\n\ncontract's severability clause.          Santiago-Sepúlveda II, 634 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 211-12.\n\n             Finally, on reconsideration, the magistrate judge issued\n\nhis third opinion on July 30, 2009.       In it, he reaffirmed that the\n\nterms found illegal in the previous opinion were severable and held\n\nthat two more terms were unenforceable under Puerto Rico law.\n\nSantiago-Sepúlveda III, 638 F. Supp. 2d at 200, 204-05.                 He\n\nthereafter entered a final judgment in favor of Esso and Total\n\n(which had intervened to defend its franchise contract and its\n\nacquisition of Esso's properties).\n\n\n     2\n      Santiago-Sepúlveda v.

Further, by\nits terms section 2802(b)(2)(E) is limited to franchise terms that\nare three years or longer.\n\n                                  -7-\n\f            If a franchisor terminates the franchise relationship but\n\nfails to comply with these requirements, its franchisees can sue it\n\nfor equitable relief, actual and exemplary damages, and attorney\n\nand expert witness fees.        15 U.S.C. § 2805(a), (b), (d).         When the\n\nfact of termination is proved by the franchisee (and it is conceded\n\nhere), the burden falls on the franchisor to establish \"that such\n\ntermination or nonrenewal was permitted\" by PMPA.              Id. § 2805(c).\n\n            Plaintiffs' first substantive contention is that Esso did\n\nnot comply with section 2802(b)(2)(E)(iii)(II) because (allegedly)\n\nTotal did not offer the former Esso dealers \"franchise[s] . . . on\n\nterms and conditions which are not discriminatory to the franchisee\n\nas compared to franchises then currently being offered by [Total]\n\nor franchises then in effect and with respect to which [Total] is\n\nthe   franchisor.\"       15   U.S.C.    §    2802(b)(2)(E)(iii)(II).      In   a\n\nnutshell,    plaintiffs       allege    on    appeal   that   different   Esso\n\nfranchisees were offered different contracts by Total.\n\n            For example, plaintiffs say that Total required some to\n\noperate a convenience store, while others were not required to do\n\nso, and those operating convenience stores also had to sign non-\n\ncompete agreements, while others did not.              They also allege that\n\nTotal   included     a   term   in     the    franchise   agreement--personal\n\nsupervision by the franchisee--that would make those franchisees\n\nthat operate multiple stations in default (an interpretation that\n\nTotal's marketing director denied in his own testimony).\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f            Although plaintiffs made a discrimination claim below, it\n\nwas different from those urged on appeal.              The argument made to the\n\nmagistrate judge was that the franchises offered to them were\n\ndifferent    than      the    ones    Total      offered     to     its    preexisting\n\nfranchisees, not that the terms offered to former Esso dealers\n\ndiffered from each other.            Absent plain error, which was not even\n\nasserted on this issue, a claim not presented in the lower court is\n\nnot available on appeal.           Bennett v.

But just what must be done in good faith\n\nby the new franchisor is less certain; and the phrase could be read\n\nmerely to afford some protection to the new franchisor in making an\n\noffer that it honestly believed to be non-discriminatory.\n\n              Indeed,          Congress    emphasized           that   the   good    faith\n\nrequirement aimed only to protect franchisees from \"arbitrary or\n\ndiscriminatory\"          behavior,        but    otherwise        to   \"avoid     judicial\n\nscrutiny\"     of    the        reasoning    behind       the     franchisor's     business\n\njudgments.

But the requirement could as easily be read\n\ninstead,       or        as      well,      to        afford      further       franchisee\n\nprotection--pertinently, by disallowing an offer that might be non-\n\ndiscriminatory but was structured to be unacceptable and intended\n\nto provoke refusal.\n\n\n                                            -10-\n\f           A number of courts have construed the term in the latter\n\nsense, and while the issue has not been adequately briefed, we will\n\nassume for present purposes that such an offer would not be in good\n\nfaith.4   This might seem hard on the departing franchisor who alone\n\ncan be sued under PMPA and may have no easy way to judge the\n\nsubjective good faith of its successor; but the statute does aim to\n\nkeep the former franchisees in business and the sale of a business\n\ninvolves various risks and there are various means for the seller\n\nto protect against them.\n\n           However, no evidence suggests that Total devised the\n\nfranchise agreements in the hope that they would be rejected.         The\n\nmagistrate   judge   found   several    provisions   of   the   franchise\n\nagreement unlawful under Puerto Rico law; but Total, even assuming\n\nit shared that view, could easily have believed that the agreements\n\nwould be accepted by franchisees, old and new.            The franchise\n\nagreement was Total's standard model for renewing franchises for\n\nits own dealers, and it was buying out Esso to expand its business.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      See, e.g., Unocal Corp. v.

The   underlying   argument   is   that   the\n\ncontract could not be saved by deleting specific clauses because\n\nthose provisions were not severable from the contract and so the\n\nentire contract is invalid.        However, the contracts include a\n\n\"Severance of Clauses\" provision that reads in pertinent part as\n\nfollows:\n\n           [S]hould any provision in this Contract be\n           found    to   be    unlawful,   invalid,    or\n           unenforceable under present or future laws,\n           said provisions shall be nullified; this\n           Contract shall be interpreted and governed as\n           if said unlawful, invalid or unenforceable\n           provision had never been a part thereof, and\n           the rest of the provisions in this Contract\n           shall remain in force and will not be affected\n           by the unlawful, invalid or unenforceable\n           provision or its elimination.\n\n           The franchise agreements are largely governed by Puerto\n\nRico law and such severance is permissible under Puerto Rico law.\n\nE.g., McCrillis v.

No. 103-387, at 4 (1994), but the terms found invalid were\n\nvoided   by    the   magistrate   judge    and   so   could   hardly   justify\n\ncompensation.\n\n              As the last of their substantive claims, plaintiffs say\n\nthat the magistrate judge should have invalidated, under 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2805(f)(1), still other provisions of the contract as violations\n\nof   state    law--for   example,   a    non-compete    clause   relating   to\n\nconvenience store operations.           No request for their invalidation\n\nwas made until plaintiffs' reply brief and so they are barred on\n\nthis appeal,     Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579946\"><a href=\"/opinion/579946/juan-rivera-muriente-v-juan-agosto-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 354\n\n(1st Cir. 1992), but plaintiffs may pursue whatever remedies they\n\nretain under state law.\n\n              Plaintiffs also make a single procedural claim, namely,\n\nthat the magistrate judge misstated the burden of proof at several\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fpoints in his decision.     The statute, as already noted, says that\n\nthe plaintiff must show termination and the defendant must then\n\nshow that the conditions permitting termination were met.               15\n\nU.S.C. § 2805(c).      The magistrate judge's statements are arguably\n\ninconsistent with one another, recognizing at one point that the\n\nburden was on the defendant and at other points suggesting that\n\nplaintiffs had failed to offer evidence on specific issues.\n\n            Confusion can easily occur because a defendant often\n\ncannot know what the objection is until one is identified by the\n\nplaintiff, and a lack of evidence from the party not bearing the\n\nburden of proof can bear on whether there is an issue to be\n\nresolved.    In all events, the preserved arguments that we have\n\nconsidered do not turn on who bears the burden of proof, and there\n\nis no indication that the magistrate judge's statements affected\n\nthe outcome.    See In re LaFata, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797448\"><a href=\"/opinion/797448/in-re-vito-anthony-lafata-debtor-eastern-savings-bank-fsb-v-vito/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            Finally,   plaintiffs   seek   damages   and   attorney   fees.\n\nUnder 15 U.S.C. § 2805(d)(1), these are allowed to plaintiffs who\n\nprove a violation of sections 2802, 2803 or 2807, but, as we\n\nexplained above, plaintiffs failed to prove any such violation.\n\nAlthough the magistrate judge sided with plaintiffs on their\n\nsection 2805(f) claims, PMPA--which provides no express remedies to\n\nplaintiffs for such violations, id. § 2805(a), (d)--assuredly does\n\nnot provide damages or fees for state law violations standing\n\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\falone, so the magistrate judge correctly refused to award damages\n\nor fees.\n\n           The judgment of the court below is affirmed.   Each side\n\nwill bear its own costs on this appeal.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -18-\n\f</pre>",
