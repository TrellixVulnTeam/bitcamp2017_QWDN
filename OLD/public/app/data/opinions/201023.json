Appellant,     George\n\nEconomou, was charged by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with\n\nsexual offenses that he had allegedly committed against two of his\n\ndaughters.     A Middlesex Superior Court jury found him guilty on\n\nseveral counts, including rape of a child under sixteen (statutory\n\nrape of his daughter Martha) in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n265, § 23, rape of a person aged sixteen or over (Martha) in\n\nviolation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 22(b), assault with intent\n\nto rape (Martha) in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 265, § 24,\n\nindecent assault and battery on a child under age fourteen (his\n\ndaughter Virginia) in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 13B,\n\nand indecent assault and battery on a person aged fourteen or over\n\n(Martha) in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 13H.           Appellant\n\nwas sentenced to multiple concurrent life sentences.               Appellant\n\nappealed from his convictions, and the Massachusetts Appeals Court\n\naffirmed in a memorandum pursuant to Mass. App. Ct. R. 1:28.\n\nCommonwealth    v.    Economou,   46   Mass.   App.   Ct.   1122    (1999).\n\nThereafter, appellant filed a petition for rehearing in the Appeals\n\nCourt and an application for further appellate review in the\n\nSupreme Judicial Court.      Both were denied, exhausting appellant's\n\nstate remedies.      Commonwealth v. Economou, 429 Mass. 1107 (1999).\n\n          On May 26, 2000, appellant brought the instant petition\n\nfor writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\n\n                                    -2-\n\fchallenging, in essence, the adequacy of the evidence upon which\n\nhis convictions for the statutory rape, rape, and assault with\n\nintent to rape his daughter, Martha, were based.               On November 6,\n\n2001,      the    federal   magistrate      judge   issued    a   report   and\n\nrecommendation that the petition be denied.            On August 26, 2002,\n\nafter objections had been filed, the district judge issued an order\n\ndenying the petition.        On September 25, 2002, appellant filed an\n\napplication for a certificate of appealability, which the district\n\ncourt allowed.       This appeal followed.\n\n                                   Background\n\n              Both parties adopt the version of the facts set forth by\n\nthe Massachusetts Appeals Court in its unpublished affirmance,\n\nexcept appellant denies any assumption therein that his daughter\n\nMartha's age at the time of the alleged sexual intercourse was\n\nbelow sixteen years.        Our brief factual summation in this part of\n\nthe     opinion    rests    upon    the   Massachusetts      Appeals   Court's\n\ndescription of the facts.          We reserve until later the question of\n\nwhether the evidence sufficed to show that Martha was under age\n\nsixteen when intercourse occurred.\n\n              Appellant lived with his second wife and four children,\n\nMartha, Anthony, Jenny, and Virginia,1 in Billerica, Massachusetts.\n\nOn various occasions, appellant whipped and struck his daughters.\n\nHis sexual molestation of Martha began in 1982 when Martha was\n\n\n      1\n          The names of the victims are pseudonyms.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fabout twelve years old and continued while appellant's second wife\n\nwas hospitalized.    According to Martha, appellant would touch her\n\nbreasts, thighs, and vagina and kiss her on the mouth and breasts.\n\nWhen Martha was fifteen years old, appellant began having penile\n\nintercourse with her.      On some occasions, appellant would insert\n\nhis penis in Martha's anus until she cried, at which time he would\n\ncease and would proceed to have penile intercourse with her.\n\n            Eventually, appellant separated from his second wife and\n\nmoved to Lowell, Massachusetts with the children.       Thereafter, he\n\nbegan   a   relationship    with   another   woman,   and   the   sexual\n\nrelationship with Martha (then age twenty-four) ended.             Also,\n\nMartha began dating her future husband, Richard, leading to two\n\nphysical assaults upon her by appellant.         During the next two\n\nyears, on three occasions appellant sexually assaulted his then\n\ntwelve-year-old daughter, Virginia.\n\n            In April of 1996, after an investigation by the Lowell\n\nPolice Department and the Department of Social Services (\"DSS\"),\n\nMartha and Virginia disclosed appellant's physical and sexual\n\nabuse. This disclosure and the subsequent DSS investigation led to\n\nappellant's arrest and indictment.\n\n                               Discussion\n\n            Appellant raises two issues.     First, he argues that the\n\nevidence was insufficient to convict him of the statutory rape\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fcounts2 because no rational trier of fact could have found proof of\n\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt that Martha was under age sixteen\n\nwhen the penile-vaginal penetration commenced. Secondly, he argues\n\nthat the evidence was insufficient to convict him of rape and\n\nassault with intent to rape after Martha reached age sixteen\n\nbecause the evidence did not establish that he had engaged in or\n\nattempted intercourse by compelling Martha to submit to the sexual\n\nacts either by force and against her will or by threat of bodily\n\ninjury.\n\n           There are two potential bases for granting an application\n\nfor a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody\n\npursuant   to   the    judgment      of   a     State   court:     (1)    the    state\n\nadjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n\ninvolved   an   unreasonable         application        of,   clearly    established\n\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\n\nStates; or (2) the state adjudication resulted in a decision that\n\nwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of\n\nthe evidence presented in the state court proceeding.                    28 U.S.C. §\n\n2254(d); DiBenedetto v. Hall, 272 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           Under      the   second    criterion,        the   federal    court   must\n\npresume that the state court's determination of factual issues is\n\ncorrect, and petitioner carries \"the burden of rebutting the\n\n\n     2\n      The statutory rape counts for which appellant was convicted\nwere based only on the allegation that appellant had engaged in\nintercourse with Martha.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fpresumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\"   28\n\nU.S.C. §§ 2254(d)(2) & (e)(1).\n\n          In cases such as this, we review de novo the district\n\ncourt's denial of habeas relief.   Nadeau v. Matesanz, 289 F.3d 13,\n\n15 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          Appellant concedes in his appellate brief that a proper\n\napplication of the tests traditionally applied by the Massachusetts\n\ncourts to determine the sufficiency of the evidence will also\n\nsatisfy the requirements laid down in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S.\n\n307, 317-19 (1979) (stating, upon reviewing a habeas petition,\n\n\"[t]he relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in\n\nthe light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of\n\nfact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\").   He contends, however, that the Massachusetts\n\nAppeals Court allowed his conviction to stand on what under both\n\nstate and federal criteria would amount to less than proof beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.    To have done so, he contends, is objectively\n\nunreasonable, causing the decision of the state court to lie\n\n\"outside the universe of plausible, credible outcomes.\"     Compare\n\nMcCambridge v. Hall, 303 F.3d 24, 37 (1st Cir. 2002) (overruling\n\nthis stringent standard in favor of more lenient interpretation of\n\nthe \"unreasonable application\" requirement of 28 U.S.C. § 2254).\n\nAs did the district court and the Massachusetts Appeals Court,\n\nhowever, we hold that sufficient evidence was adduced in the\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fMassachusetts trial court to have allowed a rational trier of fact\n\nto find the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.   See\n\nJackson, 443 U.S. at 319.    Accordingly we deny the petition for\n\nhabeas relief.\n\n          A.   Statutory Rape.\n\n          Appellant argues that the only evidence supporting the\n\nallegation that he had sexual intercourse with Martha before she\n\nwas age sixteen was Martha's testimony that appellant began having\n\npenile intercourse with her when she was \"around fifteen.\"     This\n\ntestimony, appellant adds, was from a remove of almost ten years.\n\n          We need not decide whether this testimony, alone, is\n\nsufficient because Martha's testimony and the surrounding evidence\n\nprovides additional verification that she was under sixteen years\n\nold at the time of intercourse.    The Massachusetts Appeals Court\n\nnoted that Martha testified not only that she was \"about fifteen\"\n\nwhen this intercourse first occurred, but also that she remembered\n\nshe was a student at St. Joan D'Arc Junior High School when\n\nintercourse had commenced.   The record shows that Martha did not,\n\nin fact, reach age sixteen until she had left that school.   As the\n\nAppeals Court noted, the evidence indicates Martha began first\n\ngrade in the fall of 1976 when she was six years old.   If so, it\n\nwas in the fall of 1982 that she entered St. Joan D'Arc Junior\n\nHigh, where she remained for three years, repeating one of the\n\ngrades.   She was thus well under age sixteen throughout her\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fenrollment there.    This conclusion is also supported by Martha's\n\ntestimony that she graduated from the high school in 1989, a fact\n\nmaking her fifteen years old or even younger by the time she left\n\nSt. Joan D'Arc (her birthday was on July 1).      Based on the trial\n\ntranscript, therefore, we conclude that on the evidence presented\n\na rational trier of fact could have determined beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that Martha was under age sixteen at the time she left St.\n\nJoan D'Arc Junior High in the summer of 1985; that intercourse had\n\ncommenced while she was still at that school; and that she was thus\n\nunder age sixteen at the time.    Accordingly, we, like the district\n\ncourt, conclude that there was sufficient evidence.       Jackson, 443\n\nU.S. at 319.\n\n           As to the second criterion, the result is the same.\n\nAppellant has not presented clear and convincing evidence that\n\nrebuts the Appeals Court's decision.      28 U.S.C. §§ 2254(d)(2) &\n\n(e)(1).\n\n           B.   Rape and Assault with Intent to Rape.\n\n           To   obtain   a   conviction   of   forcible   rape   under\n\nMassachusetts statutory law, the Commonwealth must show that the\n\nintercourse was obtained by appellant's \"compell[ing]\" the victim\n\nto \"submit by force and against his will\" or \"by threat of bodily\n\ninjury.\"   Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 22(b).   Here, the Commonwealth\n\nrelied on a theory of constructive force.      The \"force needed for\n\nrape may, depending on the circumstances, be constructive force, as\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fwell as physical force, violence, or the threat of bodily harm.\"\n\nCommonwealth v. Caracciola, 569 N.E.2d 774, 777 (Mass. 1991).                In\n\ndiscussing   the   word   \"force\"   as     used    in   robbery,   the   Supreme\n\nJudicial Court said that \"actual force is applied to the body,\n\nconstructive force is by threatening words or gestures and operates\n\non the mind.\"      Commonwealth v. Novicki, 87 N.E.2d 1, 4 (Mass.\n\n1949).   Where, as here, the Commonwealth relies on constructive\n\nforce, it also must prove that the sexual intercourse was against\n\nthe will of the complainant.        Caracciola, 569 N.E.2d at 777.\n\n          Petitioner      argues    that     the    Commonwealth     presented\n\nevidence only that Martha had some unexpressed reservations and\n\nhindsight regrets at having engaged in sexual intercourse with her\n\nfather but that it failed to provide evidence that, while the acts\n\nwere happening, Martha communicated to appellant her lack of\n\nconsent and that the acts were against her will.                   Accordingly,\n\npetitioner contends, the Commonwealth did not satisfy its burden of\n\nproving that the acts were non-consensual, and the Appeals Court\n\ndid not apply the Jackson standard correctly when it affirmed the\n\nconviction under these two counts.3\n\n          We find, however, sufficient evidence to support the\n\njury's verdict based on a theory of constructive force.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      The Appeals Court noted that this element was also an\nelement for the assault count.\n\n                                     -9-\n\f         First, Martha's testimony supports a finding that her\n\nfather's sexual acts were against her will when they occurred.4\n\nShe testified that she tried to keep her legs shut but he would\n\nforce them open, that, in an effort to resist him, she wore\n\n\n\n    4\n      In his brief, appellant, like the Appeals Court, equates\nthe element of lack of consent with the element that the sexual\nintercourse was against the will of the complainant. In\nCaracciola, the Supreme Judicial Court discussed at length the\nelements of proving rape by constructive force, making note of\nthe additional requirement in such cases that the intercourse be\nagainst the complainant's will. 569 N.E.2d at 776-78. It did\nnot explicitly require that, in addition to proving that the\nintercourse was against the complainant's will, the Commonwealth\nprove that there was no consent. Id. Indeed, it implied that\nthe inquiries are identical:\n     We previously have recognized that a defendant can be\n     guilty of rape without having used or threatened\n     physical force if the consent of the complainant was\n     obtained from the victim's fear arising from threats or\n     conduct of a third party. . . . These cases are cited\n     to illustrate the point that an examination of the\n     circumstances or fear in which the victim is placed,\n     the impact of those circumstances or fear on the\n     victim's power to resist and the defendant's conduct\n     all are relevant to the determination of whether\n     conduct complained of by the victim was accomplished by\n     force and against the victim's will.\nId. at 776. In Commonwealth v. Lopez, however, the court stated,\n\"the Commonwealth must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthe defendant committed sexual intercourse (1) by means of\nphysical force, nonphysical, constructive force, or threats of\nbodily harm, either explicit or implicit and (2) at the time of\npenetration, three was no consent.\" 745 N.E.2d 961, 965 (Mass.\n2001) (emphasis added). There, however, the court appears to be\ndiscussing the \"force\" element of constructive force divorced\nfrom the \"will\" requirement. Id. For present purposes, we see\nno meaningful difference between determining whether the evidence\nwas sufficient to establish that the sexual intercourse was\nagainst Martha's will and determining whether it occurred without\nher consent at the time of intercourse.\n\n\n                              -10-\n\fclothing to bed that would be difficult for him to remove, that she\n\nwould turn away from him and pretend to be asleep when he looked\n\ninto her bedroom in the hope that he would not come in, and that\n\nshe cried when he performed anal sex.   Furthermore, she testified\n\nto telling him at various times she wanted him to stop.\n\n          Q: Did you ever tell your father that you\n          didn't want to have vaginal sex?\n\n          A: Yes, I did.\n\n          Q:   And did he not do it then?\n\n          A: No, he did.\n\n          Q: He always did it then anyway?\n\n          A: Yes, he did because there was a couple of\n          times that I would say, \"I don't want to do\n          this no more,\" or whatever and he'd -- he\n          would get upset and he'd start screaming at me\n          and he was just -- I don't know. He was just\n          mean. I was always scared of him.\n\n          Q: So you'd do it then; is that right?\n\n          A: Yes.\n\n          Q: He'd persuade you to; is that right?\n\n          A: Yes.\n\nThe evidence need not prove that, during each incident, Martha\n\nvoiced disapproval and appellant threatened her.    Commonwealth v.\n\nKirkpatrick, 668 N.E.2d 790, 795 (Mass. 1996) (stating, \"The\n\nCommonwealth was not required to prove that the defendant renewed\n\nthreats of physical harm every time he approached the victim to\n\nestablish that the rapes were accomplished by force and against the\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fvictim's will.\") (citations omitted).            There was no evidence she\n\never welcomed or sought his advances.           In his own trial testimony\n\non direct examination, appellant did not deny Martha's testimony\n\nconcerning      the   sexual   acts,   much   less   suggest   that   they   had\n\nresulted from her solicitation.5\n\n               The record evidence also establishes that there were\n\nthreats and violent conduct that a jury could reasonably find to\n\ninstill fear in the complainant and explain her failure to oppose\n\nappellant's advances more actively.           See Caracciola, 569 N.E.2d at\n\n777.       Martha testified she was scared of her father and feared his\n\nangry outbursts and the possibility that he would become physically\n\nviolent if she resisted his assaults.           She testified:\n\n               Q: Now, during all of those [occasions when\n               your father would have sexual intercourse with\n               you] would your father say anything to you?\n\n               A: Yeah. He would say -- he would come in,\n               and after he was done he would ask me, \"Are\n               you okay?\" or whatever, and I'd be like,\n               \"Yeah, I'm fine.\"    I'd just turn over, you\n               know, because I was scared. Like if -- like\n               when he'd ask me, \"Oh, is it all right\n               tonight?\" or whatever, and if I'd say no he\n               would get outraged. He would get wicked mad\n               and he'd, like, start swearing at me, shut --\n               slam my door or whatever. I was scared to say\n               no to him. So, you know, after -- I mean it\n               happened for so long after -- as the years\n               went on it was just, like, I felt there was no\n\n       5\n      On cross-examination, appellant agreed that when he spoke\nto Inspector Dillon and later to a Ms. Jenkins, he had denied\nsexually touching the children. He was not asked on direct\nexamination whether he had engaged in the conduct testified to by\nMartha, nor, except as just described, was that issue mentioned\nby him during his testimony.\n\n                                       -12-\n\f          use to stand up.    I would get nowhere, you\n          know what I'm saying? It would just happen.\n\nShe further testified:\n\n          A: Oh, he would call me names and swearing at\n          me, calling me a whore or, you know, just --\n          he would swear a lot.    When he'd yell he'd\n          swear a lot to me.\n\n          Q: And how did that make you feel during that\n          period of time?\n\n          A: He'd scare me. Just he made me feel scared\n          and he just, I'd just be quiet and just sit\n          there because if I ever said anything, you\n          know, it would just make him raise his voice\n          even more or, you know.\n\nAppellant would sometimes commit sexual acts upon Martha after\n\ndrinking alcohol, at which time, she testified, he would get\n\nparticularly upset if she resisted.     Further, the evidence of\n\nrecord provides a reasonable basis for Martha's fears of physical\n\nviolence. Commonwealth v. Guisti, 747 N.E.2d 673, 678 (Mass. 2001)\n\n(stating, \"It is sufficient that the Commonwealth prove that the\n\nvictim reasonably feared that he defendant would harm her if she\n\ndid not submit.\").   There was evidence appellant struck Martha's\n\nsister, Jenny, in Martha's presence.   Jenny was the one daughter\n\nwho, it was testified, stood up to appellant.   Martha testified:\n\n          Q: And on those occasions when [Jenny] would\n          speak up [against appellant] what would\n          happen?\n\n          A: My father would get upset with her. Either\n          hit her or scream at her, or you know, \"You\n          listen to me,\" or, you know.\n\n\n\n                              -13-\n\f           Q: Now, when you say that he would hit her,\n           where would he hit her?\n\n           A: Like, he would, like, slap her in the face\n           . . .\n\nWhile appellant used physical force against Martha less frequently,\n\nshe testified that he had resorted to physical violence against her\n\non three occasions -- one that occurred prior to the episodes of\n\nsexual misconduct and two that occurred a couple of months after\n\nthe sexual misconduct ended.          According to this testimony, the\n\nfirst   incident   occurred   while    she   was   in   elementary   school.\n\nAppellant learned that she had lied to him, so he forced her to\n\ntake her clothes off and stand on a bed as he whipped her with a\n\nbelt.   The latter two incidents of physical violence occurred in\n\n1995 when Martha was twenty-four years old and had begun dating her\n\nfuture husband, Richard.      She testified that appellant punched her\n\nin the face and violently shoved her inside a van after she had\n\ngone to the movies with Richard.       In the other incident, according\n\nto her testimony, appellant and Martha were in an argument about\n\nRichard which resulted in appellant putting his hands to Martha's\n\nthroat as if to strangle her.         While these two latter incidents\n\noccurred after appellant had ceased his sexual misconduct with\n\nMartha, they fit into a pattern showing appellant's readiness to\n\nuse force against his daughters if thwarted.                From all this\n\nevidence, the jury could reasonably conclude that Martha had had\n\n\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\freason to fear physical violence if she took a more active stance\n\nin rejecting her father's sexual advances.\n\n            In considering whether Martha was intimidated, the jury\n\ncould also take into account that appellant was her father, that\n\nher stepmother was infirm and unable to protect her, and that, even\n\nafter reaching the age of sixteen, Martha was poorly positioned to\n\nstand up to her father's insistent advances.                The surrounding\n\ncircumstances gave appellant a considerable degree of moral and\n\nphysical control over her.        See Caracciola, 569 N.E.2d at 776\n\n(inquiry includes \"an examination of the circumstances or fear in\n\nwhich the victim is placed, the impact of those circumstances or\n\nfear   on   the    victim's   power    to    resist   and   the   defendant's\n\nconduct.\").       Martha's father appears to have been the dominant\n\nfigure in the household.         Martha's stepmother was often ill.\n\nMartha lived with appellant \"practically [her] whole life.\"               She\n\nbegan working at his pizza restaurant when she was twelve years old\n\nand continued working until she was twenty-four years old. She had\n\nno other family in the United States with whom to seek refuge.            She\n\ntestified, \"I never had the courage to move out of the house.               I\n\nnever had a job on my own other than working at the restaurant with\n\nmy family.    You know, I didn't have friends . . . .\"            Appellant's\n\nsexual acts with Martha began when she was age twelve -- at a time\n\nwhen she was legally incapable of consenting and could be found by\n\na jury to be both helpless and particularly impressionable.             These\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\ffacts,   together    with     others    previously   discussed,    could   be\n\ndetermined by the factfinder to have impaired Martha's will and\n\nability to resist her father's advances after she had reached the\n\nage of legal consent.\n\n           Accordingly, like the Appeals Court, we find the record\n\nsufficiently establishes that Martha's submissions to appellant\n\nwere obtained by the power and authority he wielded over her,\n\ncoupled with her fear of the consequences if she did not submit.\n\nBecause he dominated both her home and work life, her reluctance to\n\nactively resist his conduct did not demonstrate consent but rather\n\ncould be found to have established that she was powerless to stop\n\nhim even though the acts were against her will.            On this record,\n\nthe Appeals Court's determination is not objectively unreasonable.\n\nSince appellant is unable to point to clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat the   actions     were   not   against   Martha's   will,    the   second\n\nexception does not apply.        28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f",

A Middlesex Superior Court jury found him guilty on\n\nseveral counts, including rape of a child under sixteen (statutory\n\nrape of his daughter Martha) in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n265, § 23, rape of a person aged sixteen or over (Martha) in\n\nviolation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 22(b), assault with intent\n\nto rape (Martha) in violation of Mass. Gen.

Economou, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1107</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999).\n\n          On May 26, 2000, appellant brought the instant petition\n\nfor writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\n\n                                    -2-\n\fchallenging, in essence, the adequacy of the evidence upon which\n\nhis convictions for the statutory rape, rape, and assault with\n\nintent to rape his daughter, Martha, were based.               On November 6,\n\n2001,      the    federal   magistrate      judge   issued    a   report   and\n\nrecommendation that the petition be denied.            On August 26, 2002,\n\nafter objections had been filed, the district judge issued an order\n\ndenying the petition.        On September 25, 2002, appellant filed an\n\napplication for a certificate of appealability, which the district\n\ncourt allowed.       This appeal followed.\n\n                                   Background\n\n              Both parties adopt the version of the facts set forth by\n\nthe Massachusetts Appeals Court in its unpublished affirmance,\n\nexcept appellant denies any assumption therein that his daughter\n\nMartha's age at the time of the alleged sexual intercourse was\n\nbelow sixteen years.        Our brief factual summation in this part of\n\nthe     opinion    rests    upon    the   Massachusetts      Appeals   Court's\n\ndescription of the facts.          We reserve until later the question of\n\nwhether the evidence sufficed to show that Martha was under age\n\nsixteen when intercourse occurred.\n\n              Appellant lived with his second wife and four children,\n\nMartha, Anthony, Jenny, and Virginia,1 in Billerica, Massachusetts.\n\nOn various occasions, appellant whipped and struck his daughters.\n\nHis sexual molestation of Martha began in 1982 when Martha was\n\n\n      1\n          The names of the victims are pseudonyms.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fabout twelve years old and continued while appellant's second wife\n\nwas hospitalized.    According to Martha, appellant would touch her\n\nbreasts, thighs, and vagina and kiss her on the mouth and breasts.\n\nWhen Martha was fifteen years old, appellant began having penile\n\nintercourse with her.      On some occasions, appellant would insert\n\nhis penis in Martha's anus until she cried, at which time he would\n\ncease and would proceed to have penile intercourse with her.\n\n            Eventually, appellant separated from his second wife and\n\nmoved to Lowell, Massachusetts with the children.       Thereafter, he\n\nbegan   a   relationship    with   another   woman,   and   the   sexual\n\nrelationship with Martha (then age twenty-four) ended.             Also,\n\nMartha began dating her future husband, Richard, leading to two\n\nphysical assaults upon her by appellant.         During the next two\n\nyears, on three occasions appellant sexually assaulted his then\n\ntwelve-year-old daughter, Virginia.\n\n            In April of 1996, after an investigation by the Lowell\n\nPolice Department and the Department of Social Services (\"DSS\"),\n\nMartha and Virginia disclosed appellant's physical and sexual\n\nabuse. This disclosure and the subsequent DSS investigation led to\n\nappellant's arrest and indictment.\n\n                               Discussion\n\n            Appellant raises two issues.     First, he argues that the\n\nevidence was insufficient to convict him of the statutory rape\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fcounts2 because no rational trier of fact could have found proof of\n\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt that Martha was under age sixteen\n\nwhen the penile-vaginal penetration commenced. Secondly, he argues\n\nthat the evidence was insufficient to convict him of rape and\n\nassault with intent to rape after Martha reached age sixteen\n\nbecause the evidence did not establish that he had engaged in or\n\nattempted intercourse by compelling Martha to submit to the sexual\n\nacts either by force and against her will or by threat of bodily\n\ninjury.\n\n           There are two potential bases for granting an application\n\nfor a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody\n\npursuant   to   the    judgment      of   a     State   court:     (1)    the    state\n\nadjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n\ninvolved   an   unreasonable         application        of,   clearly    established\n\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\n\nStates; or (2) the state adjudication resulted in a decision that\n\nwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of\n\nthe evidence presented in the state court proceeding.                    28 U.S.C. §\n\n2254(d); DiBenedetto v.

He contends, however, that the Massachusetts\n\nAppeals Court allowed his conviction to stand on what under both\n\nstate and federal criteria would amount to less than proof beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.    To have done so, he contends, is objectively\n\nunreasonable, causing the decision of the state court to lie\n\n\"outside the universe of plausible, credible outcomes.\"     Compare\n\nMcCambridge v.

See\n\nJackson, 443 U.S. at 319.    Accordingly we deny the petition for\n\nhabeas relief.\n\n          A.   Statutory Rape.\n\n          Appellant argues that the only evidence supporting the\n\nallegation that he had sexual intercourse with Martha before she\n\nwas age sixteen was Martha's testimony that appellant began having\n\npenile intercourse with her when she was \"around fifteen.\"     This\n\ntestimony, appellant adds, was from a remove of almost ten years.\n\n          We need not decide whether this testimony, alone, is\n\nsufficient because Martha's testimony and the surrounding evidence\n\nprovides additional verification that she was under sixteen years\n\nold at the time of intercourse.    The Massachusetts Appeals Court\n\nnoted that Martha testified not only that she was \"about fifteen\"\n\nwhen this intercourse first occurred, but also that she remembered\n\nshe was a student at St. Joan D'Arc Junior High School when\n\nintercourse had commenced.   The record shows that Martha did not,\n\nin fact, reach age sixteen until she had left that school.   As the\n\nAppeals Court noted, the evidence indicates Martha began first\n\ngrade in the fall of 1976 when she was six years old.   If so, it\n\nwas in the fall of 1982 that she entered St. Joan D'Arc Junior\n\nHigh, where she remained for three years, repeating one of the\n\ngrades.   She was thus well under age sixteen throughout her\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fenrollment there.    This conclusion is also supported by Martha's\n\ntestimony that she graduated from the high school in 1989, a fact\n\nmaking her fifteen years old or even younger by the time she left\n\nSt. Joan D'Arc (her birthday was on July 1).      Based on the trial\n\ntranscript, therefore, we conclude that on the evidence presented\n\na rational trier of fact could have determined beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that Martha was under age sixteen at the time she left St.\n\nJoan D'Arc Junior High in the summer of 1985; that intercourse had\n\ncommenced while she was still at that school; and that she was thus\n\nunder age sixteen at the time.    Accordingly, we, like the district\n\ncourt, conclude that there was sufficient evidence.       Jackson, 443\n\nU.S. at 319.\n\n           As to the second criterion, the result is the same.\n\nAppellant has not presented clear and convincing evidence that\n\nrebuts the Appeals Court's decision.      28 U.S.C. §§ 2254(d)(2) &\n\n(e)(1).\n\n           B.   Rape and Assault with Intent to Rape.\n\n           To   obtain   a   conviction   of   forcible   rape   under\n\nMassachusetts statutory law, the Commonwealth must show that the\n\nintercourse was obtained by appellant's \"compell[ing]\" the victim\n\nto \"submit by force and against his will\" or \"by threat of bodily\n\ninjury.\"   Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 22(b).   Here, the Commonwealth\n\nrelied on a theory of constructive force.      The \"force needed for\n\nrape may, depending on the circumstances, be constructive force, as\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fwell as physical force, violence, or the threat of bodily harm.\"\n\nCommonwealth v. Caracciola, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 777 (Mass. 1991).                In\n\ndiscussing   the   word   \"force\"   as     used    in   robbery,   the   Supreme\n\nJudicial Court said that \"actual force is applied to the body,\n\nconstructive force is by threatening words or gestures and operates\n\non the mind.\"      Commonwealth v. Novicki, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (Mass.\n\n1949).   Where, as here, the Commonwealth relies on constructive\n\nforce, it also must prove that the sexual intercourse was against\n\nthe will of the complainant.        Caracciola, 569 N.E.2d at 777.\n\n          Petitioner      argues    that     the    Commonwealth     presented\n\nevidence only that Martha had some unexpressed reservations and\n\nhindsight regrets at having engaged in sexual intercourse with her\n\nfather but that it failed to provide evidence that, while the acts\n\nwere happening, Martha communicated to appellant her lack of\n\nconsent and that the acts were against her will.                   Accordingly,\n\npetitioner contends, the Commonwealth did not satisfy its burden of\n\nproving that the acts were non-consensual, and the Appeals Court\n\ndid not apply the Jackson standard correctly when it affirmed the\n\nconviction under these two counts.3\n\n          We find, however, sufficient evidence to support the\n\njury's verdict based on a theory of constructive force.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      The Appeals Court noted that this element was also an\nelement for the assault count.\n\n                                     -9-\n\f         First, Martha's testimony supports a finding that her\n\nfather's sexual acts were against her will when they occurred.4\n\nShe testified that she tried to keep her legs shut but he would\n\nforce them open, that, in an effort to resist him, she wore\n\n\n\n    4\n      In his brief, appellant, like the Appeals Court, equates\nthe element of lack of consent with the element that the sexual\nintercourse was against the will of the complainant. In\nCaracciola, the Supreme Judicial Court discussed at length the\nelements of proving rape by constructive force, making note of\nthe additional requirement in such cases that the intercourse be\nagainst the complainant's will. 569 N.E.2d at 776-78. It did\nnot explicitly require that, in addition to proving that the\nintercourse was against the complainant's will, the Commonwealth\nprove that there was no consent. Id. Indeed, it implied that\nthe inquiries are identical:\n     We previously have recognized that a defendant can be\n     guilty of rape without having used or threatened\n     physical force if the consent of the complainant was\n     obtained from the victim's fear arising from threats or\n     conduct of a third party. . . . These cases are cited\n     to illustrate the point that an examination of the\n     circumstances or fear in which the victim is placed,\n     the impact of those circumstances or fear on the\n     victim's power to resist and the defendant's conduct\n     all are relevant to the determination of whether\n     conduct complained of by the victim was accomplished by\n     force and against the victim's will.\nId. at 776. In Commonwealth v. Lopez, however, the court stated,\n\"the Commonwealth must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthe defendant committed sexual intercourse (1) by means of\nphysical force, nonphysical, constructive force, or threats of\nbodily harm, either explicit or implicit and (2) at the time of\npenetration, three was no consent.\" </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">745</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">961</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 965 (Mass.\n2001) (emphasis added). There, however, the court appears to be\ndiscussing the \"force\" element of constructive force divorced\nfrom the \"will\" requirement. Id. For present purposes, we see\nno meaningful difference between determining whether the evidence\nwas sufficient to establish that the sexual intercourse was\nagainst Martha's will and determining whether it occurred without\nher consent at the time of intercourse.\n\n\n                              -10-\n\fclothing to bed that would be difficult for him to remove, that she\n\nwould turn away from him and pretend to be asleep when he looked\n\ninto her bedroom in the hope that he would not come in, and that\n\nshe cried when he performed anal sex.   Furthermore, she testified\n\nto telling him at various times she wanted him to stop.\n\n          Q: Did you ever tell your father that you\n          didn't want to have vaginal sex?\n\n          A: Yes, I did.\n\n          Q:   And did he not do it then?\n\n          A: No, he did.\n\n          Q: He always did it then anyway?\n\n          A: Yes, he did because there was a couple of\n          times that I would say, \"I don't want to do\n          this no more,\" or whatever and he'd -- he\n          would get upset and he'd start screaming at me\n          and he was just -- I don't know. He was just\n          mean. I was always scared of him.\n\n          Q: So you'd do it then; is that right?\n\n          A: Yes.\n\n          Q: He'd persuade you to; is that right?\n\n          A: Yes.\n\nThe evidence need not prove that, during each incident, Martha\n\nvoiced disapproval and appellant threatened her.    Commonwealth v.\n\nKirkpatrick, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 795 (Mass. 1996) (stating, \"The\n\nCommonwealth was not required to prove that the defendant renewed\n\nthreats of physical harm every time he approached the victim to\n\nestablish that the rapes were accomplished by force and against the\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fvictim's will.\") (citations omitted).            There was no evidence she\n\never welcomed or sought his advances.           In his own trial testimony\n\non direct examination, appellant did not deny Martha's testimony\n\nconcerning      the   sexual   acts,   much   less   suggest   that   they   had\n\nresulted from her solicitation.5\n\n               The record evidence also establishes that there were\n\nthreats and violent conduct that a jury could reasonably find to\n\ninstill fear in the complainant and explain her failure to oppose\n\nappellant's advances more actively.           See Caracciola, 569 N.E.2d at\n\n777.       Martha testified she was scared of her father and feared his\n\nangry outbursts and the possibility that he would become physically\n\nviolent if she resisted his assaults.           She testified:\n\n               Q: Now, during all of those [occasions when\n               your father would have sexual intercourse with\n               you] would your father say anything to you?\n\n               A: Yeah. He would say -- he would come in,\n               and after he was done he would ask me, \"Are\n               you okay?\" or whatever, and I'd be like,\n               \"Yeah, I'm fine.\"    I'd just turn over, you\n               know, because I was scared. Like if -- like\n               when he'd ask me, \"Oh, is it all right\n               tonight?\" or whatever, and if I'd say no he\n               would get outraged. He would get wicked mad\n               and he'd, like, start swearing at me, shut --\n               slam my door or whatever. I was scared to say\n               no to him. So, you know, after -- I mean it\n               happened for so long after -- as the years\n               went on it was just, like, I felt there was no\n\n       5\n      On cross-examination, appellant agreed that when he spoke\nto Inspector Dillon and later to a Ms. Jenkins, he had denied\nsexually touching the children. He was not asked on direct\nexamination whether he had engaged in the conduct testified to by\nMartha, nor, except as just described, was that issue mentioned\nby him during his testimony.\n\n                                       -12-\n\f          use to stand up.    I would get nowhere, you\n          know what I'm saying? It would just happen.\n\nShe further testified:\n\n          A: Oh, he would call me names and swearing at\n          me, calling me a whore or, you know, just --\n          he would swear a lot.    When he'd yell he'd\n          swear a lot to me.\n\n          Q: And how did that make you feel during that\n          period of time?\n\n          A: He'd scare me. Just he made me feel scared\n          and he just, I'd just be quiet and just sit\n          there because if I ever said anything, you\n          know, it would just make him raise his voice\n          even more or, you know.\n\nAppellant would sometimes commit sexual acts upon Martha after\n\ndrinking alcohol, at which time, she testified, he would get\n\nparticularly upset if she resisted.     Further, the evidence of\n\nrecord provides a reasonable basis for Martha's fears of physical\n\nviolence. Commonwealth v. Guisti, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">747</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678 (Mass. 2001)\n\n(stating, \"It is sufficient that the Commonwealth prove that the\n\nvictim reasonably feared that he defendant would harm her if she\n\ndid not submit.\").   There was evidence appellant struck Martha's\n\nsister, Jenny, in Martha's presence.   Jenny was the one daughter\n\nwho, it was testified, stood up to appellant.   Martha testified:\n\n          Q: And on those occasions when [Jenny] would\n          speak up [against appellant] what would\n          happen?\n\n          A: My father would get upset with her. Either\n          hit her or scream at her, or you know, \"You\n          listen to me,\" or, you know.\n\n\n\n                              -13-\n\f           Q: Now, when you say that he would hit her,\n           where would he hit her?\n\n           A: Like, he would, like, slap her in the face\n           . . .\n\nWhile appellant used physical force against Martha less frequently,\n\nshe testified that he had resorted to physical violence against her\n\non three occasions -- one that occurred prior to the episodes of\n\nsexual misconduct and two that occurred a couple of months after\n\nthe sexual misconduct ended.          According to this testimony, the\n\nfirst   incident   occurred   while    she   was   in   elementary   school.\n\nAppellant learned that she had lied to him, so he forced her to\n\ntake her clothes off and stand on a bed as he whipped her with a\n\nbelt.   The latter two incidents of physical violence occurred in\n\n1995 when Martha was twenty-four years old and had begun dating her\n\nfuture husband, Richard.      She testified that appellant punched her\n\nin the face and violently shoved her inside a van after she had\n\ngone to the movies with Richard.       In the other incident, according\n\nto her testimony, appellant and Martha were in an argument about\n\nRichard which resulted in appellant putting his hands to Martha's\n\nthroat as if to strangle her.         While these two latter incidents\n\noccurred after appellant had ceased his sexual misconduct with\n\nMartha, they fit into a pattern showing appellant's readiness to\n\nuse force against his daughters if thwarted.                From all this\n\nevidence, the jury could reasonably conclude that Martha had had\n\n\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\freason to fear physical violence if she took a more active stance\n\nin rejecting her father's sexual advances.\n\n            In considering whether Martha was intimidated, the jury\n\ncould also take into account that appellant was her father, that\n\nher stepmother was infirm and unable to protect her, and that, even\n\nafter reaching the age of sixteen, Martha was poorly positioned to\n\nstand up to her father's insistent advances.                The surrounding\n\ncircumstances gave appellant a considerable degree of moral and\n\nphysical control over her.        See Caracciola, 569 N.E.2d at 776\n\n(inquiry includes \"an examination of the circumstances or fear in\n\nwhich the victim is placed, the impact of those circumstances or\n\nfear   on   the    victim's   power    to    resist   and   the   defendant's\n\nconduct.\").       Martha's father appears to have been the dominant\n\nfigure in the household.         Martha's stepmother was often ill.\n\nMartha lived with appellant \"practically [her] whole life.\"               She\n\nbegan working at his pizza restaurant when she was twelve years old\n\nand continued working until she was twenty-four years old. She had\n\nno other family in the United States with whom to seek refuge.            She\n\ntestified, \"I never had the courage to move out of the house.               I\n\nnever had a job on my own other than working at the restaurant with\n\nmy family.    You know, I didn't have friends . . . .\"            Appellant's\n\nsexual acts with Martha began when she was age twelve -- at a time\n\nwhen she was legally incapable of consenting and could be found by\n\na jury to be both helpless and particularly impressionable.             These\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\ffacts,   together    with     others    previously   discussed,    could   be\n\ndetermined by the factfinder to have impaired Martha's will and\n\nability to resist her father's advances after she had reached the\n\nage of legal consent.\n\n           Accordingly, like the Appeals Court, we find the record\n\nsufficiently establishes that Martha's submissions to appellant\n\nwere obtained by the power and authority he wielded over her,\n\ncoupled with her fear of the consequences if she did not submit.\n\nBecause he dominated both her home and work life, her reluctance to\n\nactively resist his conduct did not demonstrate consent but rather\n\ncould be found to have established that she was powerless to stop\n\nhim even though the acts were against her will.            On this record,\n\nthe Appeals Court's determination is not objectively unreasonable.\n\nSince appellant is unable to point to clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat the   actions     were   not   against   Martha's   will,    the   second\n\nexception does not apply.        28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f</pre>",
