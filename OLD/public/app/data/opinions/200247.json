Paul Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                    Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n          Andrew R. Schulman with whom Getman, Stacey, Tamposi,\nSchulthess & Steere, P.A. was on brief for appellant.\n\n          Diane M. Gorrow with whom Soule, Leslie, Kidder, Sayward\n& Loughman, P.L.L.C. was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          December 17, 2002\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.           In this Telecommunications Act\n\ncase the plaintiff, a landowner, was denied permission to build a\n\nwireless communications tower by the Pelham, New Hampshire Zoning\n\nBoard of Appeals (ZBA or Board).            The federal district court, on\n\ncross motions for summary judgment, rejected the landowner's claims\n\nthat (1) the ZBA decision was not supported by substantial evidence\n\nand (2) the decision was an unlawful effective prohibition on the\n\nprovision of wireless services.           In doing so, the district court\n\nadopted a rule that so long as any carrier provides service in the\n\narea,    there   is   never   a   basis   for   a   claim   that   a   town   has\n\neffectively prohibited personal wireless service, in violation of\n\nthe Act, by preventing other carriers from filling a significant\n\ngeographic gap in their cellular networks.             This holding raises a\n\nnovel and interesting question.             We disagree with the district\n\ncourt's rule, but affirm on other grounds.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            Second Generation planned to build on its land in Pelham1\n\na telecommunications tower which would permit carriers to provide\n\nservice along N.H. Route 128, a state highway.               Pelham has four\n\ncommercial cell towers, one approved after the ZBA denied Second\n\n\n     1\n       Pelham, New Hampshire is on the Massachusetts border\njust north of Lowell, Massachusetts and Dracut, Massachusetts\nand midway between Salem, New Hampshire and Nashua, New\nHampshire. It lies between Interstate 93 and U.S. 3, the two\nmajor north-south highways serving New Hampshire's southern\ntier.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fGeneration's first variance application.             Pelham has six licensed,\n\noperating   wireless      carriers:    Voicestream      Communications;      AT&T\n\nWireless;    Sprint      PCS;    Verizon;     U.S.    Cellular;      and   Nextel\n\nCommunications (as they are currently known). Cingular Wireless is\n\nnot among them.       Second Generation owns a ninety acre, heavily\n\nwooded lot at the top of Seavy Hill (also called Spaulding Hill)\n\ndirectly above a portion of Route 128, which runs through a narrow\n\nvalley between two ridges of hills.           Daily traffic on this portion\n\nranges from 10,000 cars, just south of N.H. Route 111A, to around\n\n4,500 cars, north of Route 111A.\n\n            Two wireless carriers, AT&T Wireless and Voicestream,\n\noriginally committed to use the Second Generation tower, but\n\nVoicestream withdrew from its agreement, leaving only AT&T under\n\ncontract. Two other carriers, Sprint PCS and Nextel, had expressed\n\ninterest in using the proposed tower.\n\n            In   1998,    Second    Generation       applied   for    a    special\n\nexception to erect a 400-foot cell tower on Spaulding Hill.                    The\n\nzoning   ordinance    then      provided    that   communications     towers    in\n\nresidential zones were a permitted use, subject to obtaining a\n\nspecial exception.       The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) denied the\n\nrequest for a special exception on June 8, 1998. Second Generation\n\nappealed to the state Superior Court, which upheld the decision.\n\nSecond Generation then applied to build a smaller, 250-foot cell\n\ntower.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f               In March 1999, the town passed a Personal Wireless\n\nServices Ordinance which authorizes the town's Planning Board to\n\nissue conditional use permits for the construction of cell towers\n\nin a newly established \"Telecommunications Overlay Zone.\"                  The\n\nOverlay Zone includes only areas currently zoned for industrial and\n\ncommercial uses, and is separated from Route 128 by hills.                   A\n\nvariance must be obtained from the ZBA to construct a tower outside\n\nthe Overlay Zone.        Since Second Generation's property is in a\n\nresidential zone, it needed a variance.2\n\n         In February 2000, Second Generation filed a federal court\n\ncomplaint     alleging   that   the    ordinance   violated   the    TCA    by\n\neffectively     prohibiting     the   provision    of   personal    wireless\n\nservices, in violation of 47 U.S.C. ยง 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(II) (2000),\n\nand unreasonably discriminating against some licensed wireless\n\ncarriers, in violation of ยง 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I).          It also brought a\n\nclaim against the town under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 (2000).              The court\n\nissued a stay in August 2000 to allow Second Generation to seek a\n\nvariance from the ZBA.\n\n\n\n     2\n       The Planning Board had obtained a legal opinion and public\ncomment, conducted research on limiting cell towers to commercial\nor industrial zones, and discussed associated technological,\neconomic, safety, and social issues. It met with Blaine Hopkins,\nSecond Generation's expert; Hopkins proposed a multi-district\noverlay zone, which the board rejected. The Planning Board did\nnot, however, retain its own expert, contact wireless carriers,\ncommission a radio frequency propagation study, evaluate the\ncharacteristics of various sites, or attempt to formally assess the\nquality of existing service.\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            At the ZBA variance hearing, Second Generation presented\n\ntestimony      from   its    engineers        (one     a    Voicestream      employee),\n\nconsultants (one from AT&T), attorneys, and its general partner.\n\nRepresentatives of AT&T and Voicestream stated that their networks\n\nhad   coverage    gaps      on    Route   128.3        Blaine     Hopkins,       a   Second\n\nGeneration consultant, purported to show that the presence of a\n\ncell tower has no impact on property values, and that the alleged\n\ngaps could not be serviced by existing Pelham towers or new 190-\n\nfoot towers in the Overlay Zone.                  A Second Generation executive\n\ntestified that the cell tower would generate less noise and traffic\n\nthan would a single residence, that the surrounding topography\n\nwould hide the lower part of the tower, and that research by a\n\nlocal appraiser confirmed that the tower would not diminish the\n\nvalue of surrounding properties.\n\n            Numerous abutters and other Pelham residents testified\n\nthat the tower would interfere with their view and spoil the\n\npristine character of the neighborhood.                    Three abutters said that\n\nthe tower would diminish property values; one reported that local\n\nreal estate firms had informed him that the surrounding homes would\n\nbe devalued by approximately fifteen percent.                      A ZBA member, also\n\na   realtor,     strongly        criticized     the    methodology         used      in   Mr.\n\nHopkins's analysis          of    the   impact    of       cell   towers    on    property\n\n\n\n      3\n       The town's planning director acknowledged that her own cell\nphone did not work on the southern part of Route 128.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fvalues.4      Two    residents    contended     that    the   Second   Generation\n\nproperty could be put to other uses:            for agriculture, residential\n\ndevelopment, tree harvesting, or elderly housing.                  One abutter and\n\none ZBA member stated that they had phone service within the\n\nalleged gap.         A resident also testified that the area could be\n\nlargely     served    by   a   tower   in   a   commercial     zone    in   Dracut,\n\nMassachusetts.\n\n             The Board voted unanimously to deny the variance on the\n\nground     that   Second   Generation       failed    to   prove    \"hardship\"   as\n\nrequired by New Hampshire law.\n\n            Second Generation amended its complaint to challenge the\n\nZBA decision as well as the ordinance.               It alleged that Pelham had\n\ninstituted an \"absolute prohibition\" against the construction of\n\ncell towers in residential zones, that at least four of the six\n\nlicensed wireless carriers had significant coverage gaps along\n\nRoute 128, and that it would be impossible to eliminate these gaps\n\nwithout building a cell tower in a residential zone. The ordinance\n\nand waiver, it asserted, violated 47 U.S.C. ยง 332(c)(7)(B)(i) by\n\neffectively       prohibiting      wireless      service      and     unreasonably\n\ndiscriminating against the four carriers. It also added new claims\n\nthat the ZBA's waiver denial was not supported by adequate written\n\n\n     4\n        The ZBA member observed that in a housing market\nappreciating at a rate of 1.5 percent per month, the fact that home\nvalues have remained stable over a few years is consistent with the\nproposition that cell towers reduce property values.\n\n                                       -6-\n\ffindings or substantial evidence in the record, in violation of\n\nยง 332(c)(7)(B)(iii).         Second Generation dropped its 42 U.S.C.\n\nยง 1983 claim and its request for damages; it now requested only\n\nthat the court enjoin the town ordinance.\n\n          Shortly after the ZBA decision, the New Hampshire Supreme\n\nCourt decided Simplex Technologies, Inc. v. Town of Newington, 766\n\nA.2d 713 (N.H. 2001), which relaxed the criteria for proving\n\nhardship in zoning board proceedings.            Id. at 717.     In May 2001,\n\nboth parties filed summary judgment motions. On June 27, 2001, the\n\ndistrict court remanded the case to the ZBA for a redetermination\n\nof hardship.\n\n           At    the   ZBA   hearing    on    September    24,   2001,    Second\n\nGeneration presented testimony from two experts and two attorneys;\n\nseveral residents again testified in opposition.                  The hearing\n\nyielded   the   following    new   information.         The   Pelham   Planning\n\nDirector testified that the Planning Board was considering proposed\n\nsubdivisions with approximately forty-five homes near the Second\n\nGeneration tract.      Second Generation's radio frequency engineer,\n\nAnthony Wells, presented a propagation study purporting to show\n\nthat the alleged gap could not be serviced by existing Pelham\n\ntowers, new 195-foot towers in the Overlay Zone, or an existing\n\ntower in Hudson, New Hampshire.              Second Generation also made a\n\nnumber    of    concessions.       First,      Second     Generation     experts\n\nacknowledged that the company's tract was not the only site that\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fcould provide coverage in the alleged gap.                  Second, they did not\n\ncontest that a tower shorter than 250 feet could allow a limited\n\nnumber of carriers to service the alleged gap.                 Second Generation\n\nexecutives later said that they were willing to settle, at least\n\ntemporarily, for a variance to build a 199-foot tower.                       Finally,\n\nwhen counsel to an abutter stated that carriers in New Hampshire\n\ncan enter into right-of-way leases along state highways, Second\n\nGeneration acknowledged that it had not explored this option and\n\nwas unsure about its effectiveness.\n\n             The ZBA denied the waiver in a written decision dated\n\nSeptember 27, 2001, finding that Second Generation did not meet any\n\nof    the   five    conditions     for    obtaining     a    waiver,    and,       more\n\nspecifically, that Second Generation had failed to meet any of the\n\nthree unnecessary hardship criteria.\n\n             The    parties   again      filed    cross-motions        for    summary\n\njudgment    in     district   court      and   agreed   to    resolve        the   case\n\nessentially on a case-stated basis.               The court had before it the\n\nrecord developed as a result of the ZBA hearings; for the effective\n\nprohibition claim, it also considered other evidence submitted by\n\nthe   parties      in   support   of   their     motions.     Second     Generation\n\nsubmitted affidavits that four of the six carriers licensed to\n\nprovide wireless services in Pelham experienced gaps in coverage\n\nalong Route 128, but that one licensed carrier, U.S. Cellular, had\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\froaming coverage in the alleged gap via the network of Cingular\n\nWireless.\n\n            On May 21, 2002, the district court granted Pelham's\n\nmotion for summary judgment and denied Second Generation's motion.\n\nSecond Generation Props., L.P. v. Town of Pelham, No. Civ. 00-90-B,\n\n2002 WL 1018923, at *6 (D.N.H. May 21, 2002).             The court held that\n\nSecond Generation did not meet its burden to show that there was a\n\nsignificant gap in coverage or its burden to show that the gap\n\ncould not be filled by other means.                It found that a gap is\n\nsignificant only if the area in question is not served by any\n\ncarrier.    Id. at *3.     The court found that U.S. Cellular provided\n\nroaming service and Nextel might provide regular service along the\n\nrelevant    portion   of   Route    128.     Id.     It   noted   that   Second\n\nGeneration's propagation study did not consider the possibility\n\nthat a carrier could obtain a waiver of the Ordinance's 199-foot\n\nheight limitation and build a taller tower in the Overlay Zone.\n\nId.   In addition, the court observed that Second Generation failed\n\nto investigate whether other sites outside the Overlay Zone could\n\nprovide the necessary service.         Id.   The district court also held\n\nthat substantial evidence supported the ZBA's decision to deny the\n\nwaiver.    Id. at *4-*5.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            The TCA preserves state and local authority over the\n\nsiting and    construction     of   wireless   communication      facilities,\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fsubject to five exceptions specified in the Act.                      47 U.S.C.\n\nยง 332(c)(7)(B); see Town of Amherst v. Omnipoint Communications\n\nEnters., Inc., 173 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 1999).              Two exceptions, the\n\nsubstantial      evidence    and    effective    prohibition       clauses,    are\n\npertinent   here.5      If   a     board   decision    is    not   supported    by\n\nsubstantial evidence, ยง 332(c)(7)(B)(iii), or if it effectively\n\nprohibits the provision of wireless service, ยง 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(II),\n\nthen under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, local law is\n\npre-empted in order to effectuate the TCA's national policy goals.\n\nA.   Substantial Evidence Attack on ZBA Decision\n\n            Second Generation argues that the ZBA's decision is not\n\nsupported   by    substantial      evidence     and   so    is   invalid.      The\n\nsubstantial evidence test is highly deferential to the local board.\n\nSee Penobscot Air Servs., Ltd. v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 164 F.3d\n\n713, 718 (1st Cir. 1999).           As Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems,\n\nInc. v. Todd, 244 F.3d 51 (1st Cir. 2001), explains:\n\n            The 'substantial evidence' standard of review is the same\n            as that traditionally applicable to a review of an\n            administrative agency's findings of fact.        Judicial\n            review under this standard, even at the summary judgment\n            stage, is narrow. . . . Substantial evidence is such\n            relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\n            adequate to support a conclusion.         . . . [T]he\n            possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from\n\n\n\n     5\n       A third exception is that a local board decision will not be\nupheld if it unreasonably discriminates \"among providers of\nfunctionally equivalent services.\" ยง 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I). Although\nsuch a claim was made in the complaint, it has been abandoned.\nSecond Generation, 2002 WL 1018923, at *2 n.4.\n\n                                      -10-\n\f            the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's\n            finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\n\nId. at 58 (internal quotations omitted). In conducting substantial\n\nevidence review, a reviewing court normally considers only evidence\n\ncontained    in   the   administrative   record    (i.e.,    the   evidence\n\npresented to the ZBA).      See Nat'l Tower, LLC v. Plainville Zoning\n\nBd. of Appeals, 297 F.3d 14, 20-21 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            In order to qualify for a variance under New Hampshire\n\nlaw, the    landowner   must   show   that   meeting   the   normal   zoning\n\nrequirements poses an unnecessary hardship.        Olszak v. Town of New\n\nHampton, 661 A.2d 768, 771 (N.H. 1995).6        Under New Hampshire law,\n\napplicants must meet a three-prong test to establish unnecessary\n\nhardship:\n\n            (1) a zoning restriction as applied to their property\n            interferes with their reasonable use of the property,\n            considering the unique setting of the property in its\n            environment; (2) no fair and substantial relationship\n            exists between the general purposes of the zoning\n            ordinance and the specific restriction on the property;\n            and (3) the variance would not injure the public or\n            private rights of others.\n\nSimplex Techs., Inc., 766 A.2d at 731-32.              The ZBA found that\n\nSecond Generation did not meet any of the prongs.             It explained\n\n\n     6\n       Olszak provides that in order to obtain a variance,\nSecond Generation had the burden to show: (1) a denial of the\nvariance would result in unnecessary hardship to the\napplicant; (2) surrounding properties would suffer no\ndiminution in value; (3) the proposed use would not be\ncontrary to the spirit of the ordinance; (4) granting the\nvariance would benefit the public interest; and (5) granting\nthe variance would do substantial justice. 661 A.2d at 771.\n\n                                  -11-\n\fthat the land, given its unique setting, could reasonably be used\n\nfor the residential purposes for which it was zoned and that there\n\nwas a fair and substantial relationship between the ordinance and\n\nthe restriction on the property because the ordinance \"prohibits\n\nobtrusive commercial uses from infiltrating the residential zone.\"\n\n            Both of these determinations are amply supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence.     There was considerable, unrebutted evidence\n\nthat Second Generation's land is well suited for developing housing\n\nand that    if   Second   Generation     were   granted    a   variance,   then\n\ninhabitants of the aptly-named Scenic View Drive would look out\n\nover the top of a cell tower.              The district court correctly\n\ncharacterized the administrative record as showing:\n\n            The area [abutting the proposed tower] has no towers or\n            other non-conforming commercial uses. Roads in the area\n            are not lit by street lamps. Moreover, the property is\n            located in a section of town that is prized for its\n            spectacular views of the surrounding countryside.\n            Several of the residences that would be affected by the\n            proposed tower have deed restrictions protecting their\n            views. Further, while only a limited number of existing\n            residences would have a view of the tower, it is unclear\n            whether it would also impair the views of any of the\n            homes that are likely to be built in several proposed\n            subdivisions in the area.\n\nSecond Generation, 2002 WL 1018923, at *5.                In such a pristine\n\n(residential) setting, a 250-foot tower would be an obtrusive\n\n(commercial) use.\n\n            Second Generation protests that this court may only look\n\nto   the   Board's   statements,   and    not   to   the    district   court's\n\ncharacterization.      Second   Generation       confuses      two   different\n\n                                   -12-\n\fdoctrines.      This   is   not    an   instance          in   which   the    Board   is\n\nimproperly attempting to justify its decision in court on different\n\ngrounds than it gave in its written decision.                      Nat'l Tower, 297\n\nF.3d at 21.      Instead, this is simply an instance in which the\n\ndistrict court reviewed the record developed by the Board and\n\nprovided more detail than did the Board in its decision.                       That is\n\nentirely in accordance with the Act.             Local zoning boards are lay\n\ncitizen boards, and while their decisions must be in writing, the\n\nboards need not make extensive factual findings in support of their\n\nultimate decision. S.W. Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., 244 F.3d at 59-60.\n\nThe findings here are sufficient to permit judicial review, and\n\nthat ends the challenge.\n\nB.   Effective Prohibition Challenge\n\n             The more difficult question is whether, on the evidence\n\nbefore the district court, the denial of the variance sought by the\n\nlandowner constituted an unlawful effective prohibition on the\n\nprovision of wireless services.           See ยง 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(II).              This\n\nin turn raises a series of issues inherent in the \"effective\n\nprohibition\"    analysis,    including         the   requirements        to    show   an\n\neffective    prohibition;    the    contours         of    the    \"significant    gap\"\n\nformulation previously used by this court; and the relevance of\n\nevidence of coverage provided by roaming service, towers in other\n\ntowns, and carriers not licensed in the town.                    Most significantly,\n\nit raises the question of the correctness of the rule adopted by\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fthe district court that if any carrier provides any coverage within\n\na purported gap, then there cannot, as a matter of law, be an\n\neffective prohibition on the provision of wireless services.                    We\n\ndisagree with and reject any such rule, but ultimately agree with\n\nthe    court's    alternate   ground     for   holding   that    there   was    no\n\neffective prohibition.\n\n1.     Scope of Review\n\n            Unlike the substantial evidence issue, the issue of\n\nwhether the ZBA has prohibited or effectively prohibited the\n\nprovision    of   wireless    services    is   determined   de    novo   by    the\n\ndistrict court.      Nat'l Tower, 297 F.3d at 22.        The district courts\n\nare free to consider additional evidence.           Amherst, 173 F.3d at 16\n\nn.7.     In turn, this court reviews the district court's legal\n\nconclusions de novo.      Nat'l Tower, 297 F.3d at 22.            If the facts\n\nhad been contested before the district court, we would review the\n\ndistrict court's factual conclusions for clear error.              Id.   If the\n\nparties had each simply moved for summary judgment, we would review\n\nthe district court's summary judgment conclusions de novo. See ATC\n\nRealty, LLC v. Town of Kingston, 303 F.3d 91, 94 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nHere, the parties agreed that the trial judge could resolve the\n\nissues on a case-stated basis. Second Generation, 2002 WL 1018923,\n\nat *1.    Accordingly we review the inferences drawn by the district\n\ncourt from the stated facts for clear error.             See Garcia-Ayala v.\n\nLederle Parenterals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 643-45 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fIn the end, we would reach the same result here regardless of which\n\nof these standards of review applied.\n\n2.   General Standards for Anti-Prohibition Clause\n\n          The   rule   in   this   circuit   is   that    the   TCA's   anti-\n\nprohibition clause is not restricted to blanket bans on cell towers\n\nimposed by towns.      Amherst, 173 F.3d at 14.      The clause may, at\n\ntimes, apply to individual zoning decisions.        Id.    In invoking the\n\neffective prohibition language, \"the burden for the carrier . . .\n\nis a heavy one: to show from language or circumstances not just\n\nthat this application has been rejected but that further reasonable\n\nefforts are so likely to be fruitless that it is a waste of time\n\neven to try.\"   Id.     A landowner tower developer is in no better\n\nposition than a carrier and has an equally heavy burden.7\n\n          The TCA does not itself expressly authorize local zoning\n\nboards to consider whether individual decisions amount to an\n\n\"effective prohibition.\"     See 47 U.S.C. ยง 332(c)(7).         Since board\n\nactions will be invalidated by a federal court if they violate the\n\neffective prohibition provision, many boards wisely do consider the\n\npoint.   See, e.g., Amherst, 173 F.3d at 16.         There appears to be\n\nnothing in New Hampshire law to preclude a board from considering\n\n\n\n     7\n       The landowner who wishes to build a tower on its site is a\nunique plaintiff.    A landowner does not have an incentive to\nidentify possible sites on land it does not own.       A landowner\ndiffers from a service provider, whose incentive is to choose from\namong all possible sites the option providing the cheapest, highest\nquality service.\n\n                                   -15-\n\fthe issue.     The ZBA here implicitly did so by concluding that\n\nSecond Generation had failed to show that there were no alternative\n\nsites to build a tower that would solve whatever coverage problem\n\nexisted.8    No special deference is given to the board's conclusion\n\non this point.\n\n            This court has identified two sets of circumstances where\n\nthere is a prohibition \"in effect.\"         The first is where the town\n\nsets or administers criteria which are impossible for any applicant\n\nto meet.    See id. at 14.   That was the situation in National Tower,\n\nwhich affirmed the district court's finding that a permit denial\n\nconstituted an effective prohibition.          See 297 F.3d at 23-25.       The\n\nsecond   involves   the   situation    where    the    plaintiff's    existing\n\napplication is the only feasible plan; in that case, denial of the\n\nplaintiff's    application   \"might    amount    to    prohibiting    personal\n\nwireless    service.\"     Amherst,    173   F.3d      at   14;   accord   Sprint\n\nSpectrum, L.P. v. Willoth, 176 F.3d 630, 640, 643 (2d Cir. 1999).9\n\n\n     8\n       It is not the town's burden, in response to an effective\nprohibition claim and where plaintiffs have produced no contrary\nevidence, to show in the first instance that alternative sites do\nexist. Nat'l Tower, 297 F.3d at 24. Nor is it the town's burden,\nin responding to a claim that its decision is not supported by\nsubstantial evidence, to show that alternative sites were\navailable. Southwestern Bell, 244 F.3d at 63.\n     9\n       The Third Circuit has suggested that the denial of a permit\nfor a site that is the least intrusive means to close a significant\ngap in service would amount to a violation of the anti-prohibition\nclause. APT Pittsburgh Ltd. P'ship v. Penn Township Butler County,\n196 F.3d 469, 479-80 (3rd Cir. 1999); see Cellular Tel. Co. v.\nZoning Bd. of Adjustment, 197 F.3d 64, 70 (3rd Cir. 1999). The\nquestion of rejection of the least intrusive means must itself be\n\n                                     -16-\n\fThese factors, when pertinent, should be analyzed in determining\n\nwhether there is an effective prohibition.        This means, of course,\n\nthat there can be no general rule classifying what is an effective\n\nprohibition.    It is a case-by-case determination.\n\n            Second Generation initially attempts to show a violation\n\nof   the   anti-prohibition   clause   by   arguing   that   the   Personal\n\nWireless Services Ordinance restricting the location of the towers\n\nto certain districts is a blanket prohibition.            That attack is\n\nmeritless.     The Ordinance does not restrict the power to grant\n\nvariances to build towers in other districts, the town has allowed\n\nfour commercial towers to be constructed, and the town has not said\n\nas a categorical matter that it would never grant a variance\n\noutside the Overlay Zone.     There is no credible claim of a blanket\n\nprohibition.\n\n            Second   Generation   then   argues   that   the   individual\n\nvariance denial is an effective prohibition.             The question of\n\nwhether an individual denial is an effective prohibition is largely\n\nfact-driven.    Since the effective prohibition clause is not self-\n\n\n\nevaluated in the context of the other options available. See 360\nDegrees Communications Co. v. Bd. of Supervisors, 211 F.3d 79,\n87 (4th Cir. 2000) (\"A community could rationally reject the least\nintrusive proposal in favor of a more intrusive proposal that\nprovides better service or that better promotes commercial goals of\nthe community.\"). This court has not addressed that precise point,\nnor need we do so here. See generally Indus. Communications and\nElecs., Inc. v. Town of Falmouth, 2000 WL 761002 (D. Me. May 9,\n2000) (order) (distinguishing between the Third Circuit's least\nintrusive means approach and the First Circuit's Amherst analysis).\n\n                                  -17-\n\fexplanatory, the importance of particular facts must be seen\n\nthrough the prism of the statutory language and intent.                   Overall,\n\nthe   TCA    attempts     to   reconcile    the    goal     of   preserving    local\n\nauthority over land use with the need \"to facilitate nationally the\n\ngrowth of wireless telephone service.\"               Amherst, 173 F.3d at 13.\n\nCongress intended to promote a national cellular network.                      Id.;\n\nsee also Todd, 244 F.3d at 57 (TCA reflects Congress's intent\n\nto rapidly expand personal wireless services); President's\n\nStatement         on   Signing   the     Telecommunications         Act   of   1996\n\n(February 8, 1996), reprinted in 3 Federal Telecommunications\n\nLaw: A Legislative History of the Telecommunications Act of\n\n1996, doc. 95, at 208 (B.D. Reams, Jr. & W.H. Manz eds., 1997)\n\n(TCA intended to promote universal service).                      The Act aims to\n\nsecure lower prices and better service for consumers by opening all\n\ntelecommunications markets to competition.                See Telecommunications\n\nAct of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, pmbl., 110 Stat. 56, 56; H.R.\n\nConf.      Rep.    No.   104-458,   at    113     (1996),    reprinted    in   1996\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 10, 10.10           Thus, the Act attempts to reconcile the\n\ninterests of consumers and residents (many of whom are themselves\n\ncell phone users).\n\n\n\n      10\n        The committee reports and presidential and vice-\npresidential statements on the TCA and its precursors do not\ndiscuss the meaning of the effective prohibition section. See\n1, 3 Federal Telecommunications Law, supra.\n\n                                         -18-\n\fa.   \"Significant Gap\" Formulation\n\n           Courts have provided a judicial gloss on the effective\n\nprohibition language of the statute in order to determine whether\n\na coverage problem exists at all.    We have concluded that a town's\n\nrefusal to permit a tower that is needed to fill a \"significant\n\n[geographic] gap\" in service, where no service at all is offered in\n\nthe gap, would violate the effective prohibition clause. See Nat'l\n\nTower, 297 F.3d at 20; accord Willoth, 176 F.3d at 643; APT\n\nPittsburgh Ltd. P'ship, 196 F.3d at 480.     The context in which a\n\nquestion arises is important.        In National Tower, where this\n\ncircuit adopted and employed a significant gap analysis, it was\n\nundisputed that no carrier provided coverage in the geographic gap\n\narea and that the gap affected the ability of a large number of\n\nusers to connect or maintain a connection, id. at 17-18.   The issue\n\naddressed in National Tower by the \"significant gap\" formulation,\n\nthen, had to do with when a purported geographic gap, served by no\n\ncarrier, is large enough in terms of physical size and number of\n\nusers affected to amount to an effective prohibition, rather than\n\nbeing a mere, and statutorily permissible, dead spot.       Federal\n\nregulations contemplate that areas enjoying adequate coverage will\n\nstill include spots without reliable service.       See 360 Degrees\n\nCommunications Co., 211 F.3d at 87; 47 C.F.R. ยง 22.911(b) (2001);\n\nsee also id. ยง 22.99 (defining dead spots as \"[s]mall areas within\n\n\n\n\n                               -19-\n\fa service area where the field strength is lower than the minimum\n\nlevel for reliable service\").\n\n            Like many legal concepts, the \"significant gap\" language\n\nused in one context is now being used by the parties to address a\n\nqualitatively different and much more complex set of problems. The\n\nparties   use   the   phrase   to   frame   arguments   about   whether    an\n\neffective prohibition can exist in a geographic area where a\n\ncarrier already provides some service.          The ultimate question of\n\ncourse remains whether a given decision, ordinance, or policy\n\namounts to an effective prohibition on the delivery of wireless\n\nservices.   Inquiries into the existence and type of gap are merely\n\nhelpful analytic tools toward that end.11\n\nb.   Consideration of Services by Out-of-town Carriers\n\n            Second Generation attempts to buttress its argument by\n\nsaying the coverage that does exist should be ignored and so this\n\nis actually a situation where no carrier provides coverage.               The\n\nonly carriers that provide coverage in the purported gap are U.S.\n\nCellular, which provides roaming service via the Cingular Wireless\n\nnetwork, and Cingular Wireless, which is not licensed in Pelham and\n\nprovides service from a tower in Dracut, Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n\n     11\n       Perhaps in recognition of the complexity of applying such\nan analysis in varying situations, the Fourth Circuit found\nunhelpful \"additional formulation[s]\" such as the \"significant gap\"\nphrase. 360 Degrees Communications Co., 211 F.3d at 87.\n\n                                    -20-\n\f           Second Generation raises a question of law as to whether\n\nthe town or court may consider service by these carriers.              In\n\nascertaining the existence and extent of coverage for purposes of\n\nresolving an effective prohibition claim (and indeed the proposed\n\nsolution), we hold it permissible to consider (1) roaming service,\n\n(2) the coverage provided from towers in other towns, and (3)\n\nservice by carriers not licensed in the jurisdiction at issue. See\n\nCellular Tel. Co., 197 F.3d at 71 (\"Under the right conditions it\n\nmay be possible to provide an adequate level of personal wireless\n\nservices   to   a   particular   community   solely   through   facilities\n\nlocated outside that community.\"); accord Omnipoint Communications\n\nMB Operations, LLC v. Town of Lincoln, 107 F. Supp. 2d 108, 117 n.8\n\n(D. Mass. 2000).\n\n           Second Generation protests that this result would allow\n\nPelham to displace onto other jurisdictions the obligation to host\n\nnew cell towers and would infringe the rights of carriers that\n\npurchased FCC licenses for the geographic area including Pelham.\n\nBoth these arguments overlook the fact that licensed carriers may\n\nbe able to co-locate on the same (existing) tower(s) used by out-\n\nof-town carriers.12     The   argument, moreover, runs contrary to the\n\n\n     12\n       In this case, no information has been provided as to\nwhether towers in nearby towns can host additional carriers.\nSee generally R. Long, Allocating the Aesthetic Costs of\nCellular Tower Expansion: A Workable Regulatory Regime, 19\nStan. Envtl. L.J. 373, 386-87 (2000) (observing that \"co-\nlocation\" on the same tower of antennas belonging to multiple\n\n                                   -21-\n\fTCA's        emphasis   on   protecting    the     interests   of   consumers   and\n\nresidents rather than those of carriers and developers.\n\n3.              Rejection of Rule That Any Coverage Equals No Effective\n                Prohibition\n\n                This case squarely raises the issue, which has divided\n\nthe   courts, of whether there can ever be an effective prohibition\n\nof personal wireless service if there is any carrier that provides\n\ncoverage        in   the   geographic   gap      area.   The   district    court,\n\nfollowing the Third Circuit holding in ATP Pittsburgh Ltd.\n\nPartnership, 196 F.3d at 480, adopted the rule that if any\n\ncoverage is provided in the gap area by any carrier (including\n\nroaming service through a tower in a different town) then\n\nthere can be no effective prohibition. 13\n\n\ncarriers has become an increasingly common practice).     We\nwould view very differently a case in which a town attempted\nto deflect onto another jurisdiction the need to build new\ntowers necessary to provide services to meet the TCA's goals\nwhere no service has been provided.\n        13\n        The district court also thought the Second Circuit had\nadopted such a rule in Sprint Spectrum L.P. v. Willoth, 176 F.3d\n630 (2d Cir. 1999). We read the case differently. The relevant\npassage appears to hold that once a carrier has adequate\n(though less than perfect) service in an area, local boards\ncan deny applications by that carrier for additional towers\nwithout violating the effective prohibition clause.       Id. at\n643. This reading is buttressed by the context in which this\npassage appears: the following two paragraphs explain that\nthere is no effective prohibition because Sprint could provide\nadequate coverage with just one or two towers rather than the\nthree towers it requested in its application. Id. at 643-44.\nThe court's effective prohibition analysis does not discuss\nthe provision of wireless services by other carriers. Id. at\n\n                                          -22-\n\f          A flat \"any service equals no effective prohibition\"\n\nrule would say a town could refuse permits to build the towers\n\nnecessary to solve any number of different coverage problems. 14\n\n\n639-44. Furthermore, its stress on adequate coverage should\nlogically mean that circuit would oppose an \"any coverage\nequals no gap\" rule. See id. at 643 (\"Furthermore, once an\narea is sufficiently serviced by a wireless service provider,\nthe right to deny applications becomes broader: State and\nlocal governments may deny subsequent applications without\nthereby violating subsection B(i)(II).\") (emphasis added).\n     14\n        Problems could arise in the following situations.\n1)   The only carrier providing service in a gap area does not\nprovide service nationwide. The established carriers want to fill\na significant geographic gap in their nationwide networks by\nconstructing a tower in the town. The town denies the established\ncarriers' application to build a tower in the only feasible\nlocation on the ground that a carrier already provides service in\nthe town.\n2) A gap is served by carrier A, which provides coverage for 1% of\nthe cell phone users in the area. Some 99% of local users, who\nsubscribe to different carriers, have no service in the gap. There\nis no more room on the tower used by carrier A to add the other\ncarriers and the town denies a permit to build a tower in the only\nother feasible location.\n3) Carrier A, using a minority technology, provides service\nin a gap. A town then refuses to permit the construction of\na tower to serve the carriers who use the alternative and\nprevalent technology. Or vice-versa. There are no feasible\nalternatives.\n4) Carriers first provide service in the geographic gap to a\nsmall percentage of potential users and then the number of\nsubscribers grows exponentially such that there is a\ndeterioration of services. The majority of calls fail in a\nnew geographic gap but occasionally some go through.           The\ncarriers want to build a new tower in the only feasible\nlocation so the customers can receive uninterrupted service.\nThe town denies a permit.\n5)    A new generation of technology emerges but it cannot\ncompete with older technologies because carriers using the new\ntechnology cannot build towers in the only feasible locations.\nThe town denies permits on the ground that old technology\n\n                              -23-\n\fIt   is   highly       unlikely        that    Congress             intended     the     many\n\nqualitatively different and complex problems to be lumped\n\ntogether    and    solved       by    a    rule    for        all    seasons      that    any\n\ncoverage in a gap area automatically defeats an effective\n\nprohibition claim.            Such a rule would be highly problematic\n\nbecause it does not further the interests of the individual\n\nconsumer.     To use an example from this case, it is of little\n\ncomfort     to     the       customer       who        uses     AT&T        Wireless      (or\n\nVoicestream,       Verizon,        Sprint,        or    Nextel)        who      cannot    get\n\nservice along the significant geographic gap which may exist\n\nalong Route 128 that a Cingular Wireless customer does get\n\nsome service in that gap.              Of course, that AT&T customer could\n\nswitch to Cingular Wireless.                  But were the rule adopted, the\n\nsame customer might well find that she has a significant gap\n\nin coverage a few towns over, where AT&T Wireless, her former\n\nprovider, offers service but Cingular Wireless does not.                                  The\n\nresult    would    be     a   crazy       patchwork       quilt        of    intermittent\n\ncoverage.        That quilt might have the effect of driving the\n\nindustry    toward       a    single      carrier.        When        Congress     enacted\n\nlegislation       to     promote     the      construction            of    a   nationwide\n\ncellular network, such a consequence was not, we think, the\n\n\n\ncarriers already provide service in the area.\n\n                                          -24-\n\fintended result, see, e.g., S.

But no evidence on the\nseverity of these effects or other economic implications has\nbeen provided by the parties.        In the absence of such\nevidence, we proceed cautiously.       See Denver Area Educ.\nTelecomm. Consortium, Inc. v. F.C.C., 518 U.S. 727, 742 (1996)\n(\"[A]ware as we are of the changes taking place in the law,\nthe technology, and the industrial structure related to\ntelecommunications, we believe it unwise and unnecessary\ndefinitively to pick one analogy or one specific set of words\nnow.\") (citation omitted); id. at 777 (Souter, J., concurring)\n(because the technology is continuing to evolve, and because\ntechnological     changes    have    substantial    regulatory\nimplications, \"we should be shy about saying the final word\ntoday about what will be accepted as reasonable tomorrow\").\n\n                                     -25-\n\fยง   332(c)(7)(B).      We   start   with    the    fact    that   Congress   used\n\n\"services\" and not \"service.\"         A straightforward reading is that\n\n\"services\" refers to more than one carrier.               Congress contemplated\n\nthat there be multiple carriers competing to provide services to\n\nconsumers.    That one carrier provides some service in a geographic\n\ngap should not lead to abandonment of examination of the effect on\n\nwireless services for other carriers and their customers.                    Next,\n\nthe phrase \"have the effect of prohibiting\" may well refer to\n\nactions that mostly prohibit.               For example, B.A. Garner, A\n\nDictionary of Modern Legal Usage 256 (2d ed., 1995), gives as\n\nthe first definition of effective \"having a high degree of\n\neffect.\"     (emphasis added).        Accord B.A. Garner, A Dictionary\n\nof Modern American Usage 237-38 (1998).                    Moreover, a common\n\nreading of the word \"prohibition\" standing alone would apply\n\nto a situation of denial of services to the vast majority of\n\nusers.     See, e.g., Oxford English Dictionary (2d ed. 1989)\n\n(defining     \"prohibit\"      as    \"to    prevent,       preclude,    hinder\")\n\n(emphasis    added).        Thus Congress may well have meant the\n\neffective prohibition clause to reach certain situations in\n\nwhich there is some coverage in a gap.\n\n            One     might    hypothesize          that     the    \"unreasonable\n\ndiscrimination\" language of the Act would adequately address\n\nsituations where customers of some but not all carriers lack\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\fservice in an area.      The argument would proceed that the anti-\n\nprohibition clause should be strictly read as applying only to\n\nde jure and de facto absolute prohibitions.                      This court has\n\nnot yet explicated the unreasonable discrimination clause and\n\nwe do not do so        here.      Nevertheless, the law from other\n\ncircuits    gives    little    reason      to    think    this     clause    will\n\neffectively safeguard congressional efforts to promote the\n\nbuilding of a nationwide cellular network.                   Some courts have\n\nheld that towns can discriminate against proposals that have\n\ndifferent aesthetic or safety ramifications, Willoth, 176 F.3d at\n\n638-39; see also H.R. Rep. No. 104-458 (1996), reprinted at 1\n\nFederal Telecommunications Law, supra, doc. 5, at 208; S. Rep. No.\n\n104-230 (1996), reprinted in 1 Federal Telecommunications Law,\n\nsupra, doc. 6, at 208, or a different structure, placement, or\n\ncumulative impact, see Nextel W. Corp. v. Unity Township, 282 F.3d\n\n257, 267 (3rd Cir. 2002).      See generally AT&T Wireless PCS, Inc. v.\n\nCity Council of Va. Beach, 155 F.3d 423, 427 (4th Cir. 1998) (some\n\ndiscrimination      between    providers    of     functionally         equivalent\n\nservices is allowed).\n\n           Towns, of course, are far from powerless, despite our\n\nrejection of the rule.        An applicant for a zoning permit arguing\n\nthat there is an effective prohibition must still show that there\n\nare   no   alternative    sites    which        would    solve    the     problem.\n\nImportantly, if an existing carrier provides service, then by\n\n                                   -27-\n\fdefinition there is a tower used by that owner, and the tower may\n\noffer the possibility of co-location.     If co-location on such a\n\ntower is not possible, there may be other solutions that the town\n\nregards as more palatable than the applicant's proposed tower.\n\nFinally, even if there were a significant coverage problem in terms\n\nof a number of different carriers being unable to provide service\n\nto a significant number of users, we think a town would be entitled\n\nto consider whether a particular proposed tower would solve the\n\nproblem for a smaller or larger number of providers.     Here, the\n\nfirm evidence was that a tower on Second Generation's property\n\nwould assist two of the carriers.     Little evidence was submitted\n\nabout whether it would solve the purported problem for the other\n\nfour licensed carriers.\n\n4.         Effective Prohibition and Other Potential Solutions\n\n           Dispositively on the effective prohibition issue, the\n\nrecord shows that Second Generation has not met its burden to show\n\nthat there are no other potential solutions to the purported\n\nproblem.   Specifically, Second Generation failed to show that a\n\ntaller tower (for which a height variance would be needed) could\n\nnot be built in the Overlay Zone to remedy the alleged gap.      Nor\n\ndid it show that no other feasible sites existed outside of the\n\nOverlay Zone or that the ZBA would deny variances for such sites.\n\nSecond Generation's own experts acknowledged that its land was not\n\nthe only location where a tower could provide coverage in the\n\n\n                               -28-\n\fpurported gap and that its proposed tower was likely taller than\n\nnecessary to service the alleged gap.            Second Generation also\n\nfailed to explore whether existing towers in nearby jurisdictions\n\n(which enabled U.S. Cellular customers to obtain roaming service)\n\ncould provide other carriers with coverage in the purported gap.\n\n            Though   Second   Generation   has    not   on   this   record\n\ndemonstrated that this individual denial of a permit constituted an\n\neffective prohibition, it appears there may be a coverage problem\n\nrequiring a solution. Nothing in the Town's actions thus far shows\n\nan unwillingness to acknowledge a problem or to permit the crafting\n\nof a solution.   The record suggests a range of possible solutions,\n\nnone yet determined to be infeasible, ranging from more co-location\n\non existing towers in nearby towns, to the construction of less\n\naesthetically disruptive towers in Pelham, to the placement of\n\ntowers along median strips.      Those are the sorts of choices and\n\ntrade-offs which the Act permits towns to make in the first\n\ninstance.     See Amherst, 173 F.3d at 15; Aegerter v. City of\n\nDelafield, 174 F.3d 886, 891 (7th Cir. 1999).           In this situation\n\nthe heavy artillery of federal preemption is simply unwarranted.\n\n            The judgment of the district court is affirmed.          Costs\n\nare awarded to Pelham.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\f",

The federal district court, on cross motions for summary judgment, rejected the landowner's claims that (1) the ZBA decision was not supported by substantial evidence and (2) the decision was an unlawful effective prohibition on the provision of wireless services. In doing so, the district court adopted a rule that so long as any carrier provides service in the area, there is never a basis for a claim that a town has effectively prohibited personal wireless service, in violation of the Act, by preventing other carriers from filling a significant geographic gap in their cellular networks. This holding raises a novel and interesting question. We disagree with the district court's rule, but affirm on other grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second Generation planned to build on its land in Pelham<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> a telecommunications tower which would permit carriers to provide service along N.H. Route 128, a state highway. Pelham has four commercial cell towers, one approved after the ZBA denied Second Generation's first variance application. Pelham has six licensed, operating wireless carriers: Voicestream Communications; AT &amp; T Wireless; Sprint PCS; Verizon; U.S. Cellular; and Nextel Communications (as they are currently known). Cingular Wireless is not among them. Second Generation owns a ninety acre, heavily wooded lot at the top of Seavy Hill (also called Spaulding Hill) directly above a portion of Route 128, which runs through a narrow valley between two ridges of hills. Daily traffic on this portion ranges from 10,000 cars, just south of N.H. Route 111A, to around 4,500 cars, north of Route 111A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two wireless carriers, AT &amp; T Wireless and Voicestream, originally committed to use the Second Generation tower, but Voicestream withdrew from its agreement, leaving only AT &amp; T under contract. Two other carriers, Sprint PCS and Nextel, had expressed interest in using the proposed tower.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, Second Generation applied for a special exception to erect a 400-foot cell tower on Spaulding Hill. The zoning ordinance then provided that communications towers in residential zones were a permitted use, subject to obtaining a special exception. The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) denied the request for a special exception on June 8, 1998. Second Generation appealed to the state Superior Court, which upheld the decision. Second Generation then applied to build a smaller, 250-foot cell tower.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1999, the town passed a Personal Wireless Services Ordinance which authorizes the town's Planning Board to issue conditional use permits for the construction of cell towers in a newly established \"Telecommunications Overlay Zone.\" The Overlay Zone includes only areas currently zoned for industrial and commercial uses, and is separated from Route 128 by hills. A variance must be obtained from the ZBA to construct a tower outside the Overlay Zone. Since Second Generation's property is in a residential zone, it needed a variance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 2000, Second Generation filed a federal court complaint alleging that the ordinance violated the TCA by effectively prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, in violation of 47 U.S.C. &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(II) (2000), and unreasonably discriminating against some licensed wireless carriers, in violation of &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I). It also brought a claim against the town under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000). The court issued a stay in August 2000 to allow Second Generation to seek a variance from the ZBA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the ZBA variance hearing, Second Generation presented testimony from its engineers (one a Voicestream employee), consultants (one from AT &amp; T), attorneys, and its general partner. Representatives of AT &amp; T and Voicestream stated that their networks had coverage gaps on Route 128.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Blaine Hopkins, a Second Generation consultant, purported to show that the presence of a cell tower has no impact on property values, and that the alleged gaps could not be serviced by existing Pelham towers or new 190-foot towers in the Overlay Zone. A Second Generation executive testified that the cell tower would generate less noise and traffic than would a single residence, that the surrounding topography would hide the lower part of the tower, and that research by a local appraiser confirmed that the tower would not diminish the value of surrounding properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Numerous abutters and other Pelham residents testified that the tower would interfere with their view and spoil the pristine character of the neighborhood. Three abutters said that the tower would diminish property values; one reported that local real estate firms had informed him that the surrounding homes would be devalued by approximately fifteen percent. A ZBA member, also a realtor, strongly criticized the methodology used in Mr. Hopkins's analysis of the impact of cell towers on property values.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Two residents contended that the Second Generation property could be put to other uses: for agriculture, residential development, tree harvesting, or elderly housing. One abutter and one ZBA member stated that they had phone service within the alleged gap. A resident also testified that the area could be largely served by a tower in a commercial zone in Dracut, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board voted unanimously to deny the variance on the ground that Second Generation failed to prove \"hardship\" as required by New Hampshire law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second Generation amended its complaint to challenge the ZBA decision as well as the ordinance. It alleged that Pelham had instituted an \"absolute prohibition\" against the construction of cell towers in residential zones, that at least four of the six licensed wireless carriers had significant coverage gaps along Route 128, and that it would be impossible to eliminate these gaps without building a cell tower in a residential zone. The ordinance and waiver, it asserted, violated 47 U.S.C. &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(i) by effectively prohibiting wireless service and unreasonably discriminating against the four carriers. It also added new claims that the ZBA's waiver denial was not supported by adequate written findings or substantial evidence in the record, in violation of &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(iii). Second Generation dropped its 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 claim and its request for damages; it now requested only that the court enjoin the town ordinance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the ZBA decision, the New Hampshire Supreme Court decided <i>Simplex Technologies, Inc. v. Town of Newington,</i> 145 N.H. 727, 766 A.2d 713 (2001), which relaxed the criteria for proving hardship in zoning board proceedings. <i>Id.</i> at 717. In May 2001, both parties filed summary judgment motions. On June 27, 2001, the district court remanded the case to the ZBA for a redetermination of hardship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the ZBA hearing on September 24, 2001, Second Generation presented testimony from two experts and two attorneys; several residents again testified in opposition. The hearing yielded the following new information. The Pelham Planning Director testified that the Planning Board was considering proposed subdivisions with approximately forty-five homes near the Second Generation tract. Second Generation's radio frequency engineer, Anthony Wells, presented a propagation study purporting to show that the alleged gap could not be serviced by existing Pelham towers, new 195-foot towers in the Overlay Zone, or an existing tower in Hudson, New Hampshire. Second Generation also made a number of concessions. First, Second Generation experts acknowledged that the company's tract was not the only site that could provide coverage in the alleged gap. Second, they did not contest that a tower shorter than 250 feet could allow a limited number of carriers to service the alleged gap. Second Generation executives later said that they were willing to settle, at least temporarily, for a variance to build a 199-foot tower. Finally, when counsel to an abutter stated that carriers in New Hampshire can enter into right-of-way leases along state highways, Second Generation acknowledged that it had not explored this option and was unsure about its effectiveness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ZBA denied the waiver in a written decision dated September 27, 2001, finding that Second Generation did not meet <i>any</i> of the five conditions for obtaining a waiver, and, more specifically, that Second Generation had failed to meet any of the three unnecessary hardship criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties again filed cross-motions for summary judgment in district court and agreed to resolve the case essentially on a case-stated basis. The court had before it the record developed as a result of the ZBA hearings; for the effective prohibition claim, it also considered other evidence submitted by the parties in support of their motions. Second Generation submitted affidavits that four of the six carriers licensed to provide wireless services in Pelham experienced gaps in coverage along Route 128, but that one licensed carrier, U.S. Cellular, had roaming coverage in the alleged gap via the network of Cingular Wireless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 21, 2002, the district court granted Pelham's motion for summary judgment and denied Second Generation's motion. <i>Second Generation Props., L.P. v. Town of Pelham,</i> No. Civ. 00-90-B, 2002 WL 1018923, at *6 (D.N.H. May 21, 2002). The court held that Second Generation did not meet its burden to show that there was a significant gap in coverage or its burden to show that the gap could not be filled by other means. It found that a gap is significant only if the area in question is not served by <i>any</i> carrier. <i>Id.</i> at *3. The court found that U.S. Cellular provided roaming service and Nextel might provide regular service along the relevant portion of Route 128. <i>Id.</i> It noted that Second Generation's propagation study did not consider the possibility that a carrier could obtain a waiver of the Ordinance's 199-foot height limitation and build a taller tower in the Overlay Zone. <i>Id.</i> In addition, the court observed that Second Generation failed to investigate whether other sites outside the Overlay Zone could provide the necessary service. <i>Id.</i> The district court also held that substantial evidence supported the ZBA's decision to deny the waiver. <i>Id.</i> at *4-*5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The TCA preserves state and local authority over the siting and construction of wireless communication facilities, subject to five exceptions specified in the Act. 47 U.S.C. &#167; 332(c)(7)(B); <i>see Town of Amherst v.

The substantial evidence test is highly deferential to the local board. <i>See Penobscot Air Servs., Ltd. v. Fed. Aviation Admin.,</i> 164 F.3d 713, 718 (1st Cir.1999). As <i>Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Inc. v.

Judicial review under this standard, even at the summary judgment stage, is narrow.... Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion....

In conducting substantial evidence review, a reviewing court normally considers only evidence contained in the administrative record (i.e., the evidence presented to the ZBA). <i>See Nat'l Tower, LLC v.

The ZBA found that Second Generation did not meet any of the prongs. It explained that the land, given its unique setting, could reasonably be used for the residential purposes for which it was zoned and that there was a fair and substantial relationship between the ordinance and the restriction on the property because the ordinance \"prohibits obtrusive commercial uses from infiltrating the residential zone.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both of these determinations are amply supported by substantial evidence. There was considerable, unrebutted evidence that Second Generation's land is well suited for developing housing and that if Second Generation were granted a variance, then inhabitants of the aptly-named Scenic View Drive would look out over the top of a cell tower. The district court correctly characterized the administrative record as showing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The area [abutting the proposed tower] has no towers or other non-conforming commercial uses. Roads in the area are not lit by street lamps. Moreover, the property is located in a section of town that is prized for its spectacular views of the surrounding countryside. Several of the residences that would be affected by the proposed tower have deed restrictions protecting their views. Further, while only a limited number of existing residences would have a view of the tower, it is unclear whether it would also impair the views of any of the homes that are likely to be built in several proposed subdivisions in the area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Second Generation,</i> 2002 WL 1018923, at *5.

Second Generation confuses two different doctrines. This is not an instance in which the Board is improperly attempting to justify its decision in court on different grounds than it gave in its written decision. <i>Nat'l Tower,</i> 297 F.3d at 21. Instead, this is simply an instance in which the district court reviewed the record developed by the Board and provided more detail than did the Board in its decision. That is entirely in accordance with the Act. Local zoning boards are lay citizen boards, and while their decisions must be in writing, the boards need not make extensive factual findings in support of their ultimate decision. <i>S.W. Bell Mobile Sys., Inc.,</i> 244 F.3d at 59-60.

This in turn raises a series of issues inherent in the \"effective prohibition\" analysis, including the requirements to show an effective prohibition; the contours of the \"significant gap\" formulation previously used by this court; and the relevance of evidence of coverage provided by roaming service, towers in other towns, and carriers not licensed in the town. Most significantly, it raises the question of the correctness of the rule adopted by the district court that if any carrier provides any coverage within a purported gap, then there cannot, as a matter of law, be an effective prohibition on the provision of wireless services. We disagree with and reject any such rule, but ultimately agree with the court's alternate ground for holding that there was no effective prohibition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Scope of Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the substantial evidence issue, the issue of whether the ZBA has prohibited or effectively prohibited the provision of wireless services is determined de novo by the district court. <i>Nat'l Tower,</i> 297 F.3d at 22. The district courts are free to consider additional evidence. <i>Amherst,</i> 173 F.3d at 16 n. 7. In turn, this court reviews the district court's legal conclusions de novo. <i>Nat'l Tower,</i> 297 F.3d at 22. If the facts had been contested before the district court, we would review the district court's factual conclusions for clear error. <i>Id.</i> If the parties had each simply moved for summary judgment, we would review the district court's summary judgment conclusions de novo. <i>See ATC Realty, LLC v.

The clause may, at times, apply to individual zoning decisions. <i>Id.</i> In invoking the effective prohibition language, \"the burden for the carrier ... is a heavy one: to show from language or circumstances not just that this application has been rejected but that further reasonable efforts are so likely to be fruitless that it is a waste of time even to try.\" <i>Id.</i> A landowner tower developer is in no better position than a carrier and has an equally heavy burden.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The TCA does not itself expressly authorize local zoning boards to consider whether individual decisions amount to an \"effective prohibition.\" <i>See</i> 47 U.S.C. &#167; 332(c)(7). Since board actions will be invalidated by a federal court if they violate the effective prohibition provision, many boards wisely do consider the point. <i>See, e.g., Amherst,</i> 173 F.3d at 16. There appears to be nothing in New Hampshire law to preclude a board from considering the issue. The ZBA here implicitly did so by concluding that Second Generation had failed to show that there were no alternative sites to build a tower that would solve whatever coverage problem existed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> No special deference is given to the board's conclusion on this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has identified two sets of circumstances where there is a prohibition \"in effect.\" The first is where the town sets or administers criteria which are impossible for any applicant to meet. <i>See id.</i> at 14. That was the situation in <i>National Tower,</i> which affirmed the district court's finding that a permit denial constituted an effective prohibition. <i>See</i> 297 F.3d at 23-25. The second involves the situation where the plaintiff's existing application is the only feasible plan; in that case, denial of the plaintiff's application \"might amount to prohibiting personal wireless service.\" <i>Amherst,</i> 173 F.3d at 14; <i>accord Sprint Spectrum, L.P. v. Willoth,</i> 176 F.3d 630, 640, 643 (2d Cir.1999).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> These factors, when pertinent, should be analyzed in determining whether there is an effective prohibition. This means, of course, that there can be no general rule classifying what is an effective prohibition. It is a case-by-case determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second Generation initially attempts to show a violation of the anti-prohibition clause by arguing that the Personal Wireless Services Ordinance restricting the location of the towers to certain districts is a blanket prohibition. That attack is meritless. The Ordinance does not restrict the power to grant variances to build towers in other districts, the town has allowed four commercial towers to be constructed, and the town has not said as a categorical matter that it would never grant a variance outside the Overlay Zone. There is no credible claim of a blanket prohibition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second Generation then argues that the individual variance denial is an effective prohibition. The question of whether an individual denial is an effective prohibition is largely fact-driven. Since the effective prohibition clause is not self-explanatory, the importance of particular facts must be seen through the prism of the statutory language and intent. Overall, the TCA attempts to reconcile the goal of preserving local authority over land use with the need \"to facilitate nationally the growth of wireless telephone service.\" <i>Amherst,</i> 173 F.3d at 13.

We have concluded that a town's refusal to permit a tower that is needed to fill a \"significant [geographic] gap\" in service, where no service at all is offered in the gap, would violate the effective prohibition clause. <i>See Nat'l Tower,</i> 297 F.3d at 20; <i>accord Willoth,</i> 176 F.3d at 643; APT <i>Pittsburgh Ltd. P'ship,</i> 196 F.3d at 480. The context in which a question arises is important. In <i>National Tower,</i> where this circuit adopted and employed a significant gap analysis, it was undisputed that no carrier provided coverage in the geographic gap area and that the gap affected the ability of a large number of users to connect or maintain a connection, <i>id.</i> at 17-18. The issue addressed in <i>National Tower</i> by the \"significant gap\" formulation, then, had to do with when a purported geographic gap, served by no carrier, is large enough in terms of physical size and number of users affected to amount to an effective prohibition, rather than being a mere, and statutorily permissible, dead spot. Federal regulations contemplate that areas enjoying adequate coverage will still include spots without reliable service. <i>See 360 Degrees Communications Co.,</i> 211 F.3d at 87; 47 C.F.R. &#167; 22.911(b) (2001); <i>see also id.</i> &#167; 22.99 (defining dead spots as \"[s]mall areas within a service area where the field strength is lower than the minimum level for reliable service\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like many legal concepts, the \"significant gap\" language used in one context is now being used by the parties to address a qualitatively different and much more complex set of problems. The parties use the phrase to frame arguments about whether an effective prohibition can exist in a geographic area where a carrier already provides some service. The ultimate question of course remains whether a given decision, ordinance, or policy amounts to an effective prohibition on the delivery of wireless services. Inquiries into the existence and type of gap are merely helpful analytic tools toward that end.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. <i>Consideration of Services by Out-of-town Carriers</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second Generation attempts to buttress its argument by saying the coverage that does exist should be ignored and so this is actually a situation where no carrier provides coverage. The only carriers that provide coverage in the purported gap are U.S. Cellular, which provides roaming service via the Cingular Wireless network, and Cingular Wireless, which is not licensed in Pelham and provides service from a tower in Dracut, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second Generation raises a question of law as to whether the town or court may consider service by these carriers. In ascertaining the existence and extent of coverage for purposes of resolving an effective prohibition claim (and indeed the proposed solution), we hold it permissible to consider (1) roaming service, (2) the coverage provided from towers in other towns, and (3) service by carriers not licensed in the jurisdiction at issue. <i>See Cellular Tel. Co.,</i> 197 F.3d at 71 (\"Under the right conditions it may be possible to provide an adequate level of personal wireless services to a particular community solely through facilities located outside that community.\"); <i>accord Omnipoint Communications MB Operations, LLC v. Town of Lincoln,</i> 107 F.Supp.2d 108, 117 n. 8 (D.Mass.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second Generation protests that this result would allow Pelham to displace onto other jurisdictions the obligation to host new cell towers and would infringe the rights of carriers that purchased FCC licenses for the geographic area including Pelham. Both these arguments overlook the fact that licensed carriers may be able to co-locate on the same (existing) tower(s) used by out-of-town carriers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The argument, moreover, runs contrary to the TCA's emphasis on protecting the interests of consumers and residents rather than those of carriers and developers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Rejection of Rule That Any Coverage Equals No Effective Prohibition</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case squarely raises the issue, which has divided the courts, of whether there can ever be an effective prohibition of personal wireless service if there is any carrier that provides coverage in the geographic gap area. The district court, following the Third Circuit holding in <i>APT Pittsburgh Ltd. Partnership,</i> 196 F.3d at 480, adopted the rule that if any coverage is provided in the gap area by any carrier (including roaming service through a tower in a different town) then there can be no effective prohibition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A flat \"any service equals no effective prohibition\" rule would say a town could refuse permits to build the towers necessary to solve any number of different coverage problems.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> It is highly unlikely that Congress intended the many qualitatively different and complex problems to be lumped together and solved by a rule for all seasons that any coverage in a gap area automatically defeats an effective prohibition claim. Such a rule would be highly problematic because it does not further the interests of the individual consumer. To use an example from this case, it is of little comfort to the customer who uses AT &amp;T Wireless (or Voicestream, Verizon, Sprint, or Nextel) who cannot get service along the significant geographic gap which may exist along Route 128 that a Cingular Wireless customer does get some service in that gap. Of course, that AT &amp; T customer could switch to Cingular Wireless. But were the rule adopted, the same customer might well find that she has a significant gap in coverage a few towns over, where AT &amp; T Wireless, her former provider, offers service but Cingular Wireless does not. The result would be a crazy patchwork quilt of intermittent coverage. That quilt might have the effect of driving the industry toward a single carrier. When Congress enacted legislation to promote the construction of a nationwide cellular network, such a consequence was not, we think, the intended result, <i>see, e.g.,</i> S.Rep. No. 104-23, Purpose of the Bill (1995), <i>reprinted in 1 Federal Telecommunications Law, supra,</i> doc. 2, at 1 (bill aims to \"open[] all telecommunications markets to competition\"); H.R.Rep.

We start with the fact that Congress used \"services\" and not \"service.\" A straightforward reading is that \"services\" refers to more than one carrier. Congress contemplated that there be multiple carriers competing to provide services to consumers. That one carrier provides some service in a geographic gap should not lead to abandonment of examination of the effect on wireless services for other carriers and their customers. Next, the phrase \"have the effect of prohibiting\" may well refer to actions that mostly prohibit. For example, B.A. Garner, <i>A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage</i> 256 (2d ed. 1995), gives as the first definition of effective \"having a <i>high degree</i> of effect.\" (emphasis added). <i>Accord</i> B.A. Garner, <i>A Dictionary of Modern American Usage</i> 237-38 (1998). Moreover, a common reading of the word \"prohibition\" standing alone would apply to a situation of denial of services to the vast majority of users. <i>See, e.g., Oxford English Dictionary</i> (2d ed. 1989) (defining \"prohibit\" as \"to prevent, preclude, <i>hinder</i>\") (emphasis added). Thus Congress may well have meant the effective prohibition clause to reach certain situations in which there is some coverage in a gap.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One might hypothesize that the \"unreasonable discrimination\" language of the Act would adequately address situations where customers of some but not all carriers lack service in an area. The argument would proceed that the anti-prohibition clause should be strictly read as applying only to de jure and de facto absolute prohibitions. This court has not yet explicated the unreasonable discrimination clause and we do not do so here. Nevertheless, the law from other circuits gives little reason to think this clause will effectively safeguard congressional efforts to promote the building of a nationwide cellular network. Some courts have held that towns can discriminate against proposals that have different aesthetic or safety ramifications, <i>Willoth,</i> 176 F.3d at 638-39; <i>see also</i> H.R.Rep. No. 104-458 (1996), <i>reprinted at</i> 1 <i>Federal Telecommunications Law, supra,</i> doc. 5, at 208; S.Rep.

An applicant for a zoning permit arguing that there is an effective prohibition must still show that there are no alternative sites which would solve the problem. Importantly, if an existing carrier provides service, then by definition there is a tower used by that owner, and the tower may offer the possibility of co-location. If co-location on such a tower is not possible, there may be other solutions that the town regards as more palatable than the applicant's proposed tower. Finally, even if there were a significant coverage problem in terms of a number of different carriers being unable to provide service to a significant number of users, we think a town would be entitled to consider whether a particular proposed tower would solve the problem for a smaller or larger number of providers. Here, the firm evidence was that a tower on Second Generation's property would assist two of the carriers. Little evidence was submitted about whether it would solve the purported problem for the other four licensed carriers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Effective Prohibition and Other Potential Solutions</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dispositively on the effective prohibition issue, the record shows that Second Generation has not met its burden to show that there are no other potential solutions to the purported problem. Specifically, Second Generation failed to show that a taller tower (for which a height variance would be needed) could not be built in the Overlay Zone to remedy the alleged gap. Nor did it show that no other feasible sites existed outside of the Overlay Zone or that the ZBA would deny variances for such sites. Second Generation's own experts acknowledged that its land was not the only location where a tower could provide coverage in the purported gap and that its proposed tower was likely taller than necessary to service the alleged gap. Second Generation also failed to explore whether existing towers in nearby jurisdictions (which enabled U.S. Cellular customers to obtain roaming service) could provide other carriers with coverage in the purported gap.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though Second Generation has not on this record demonstrated that this individual denial of a permit constituted an effective prohibition, it appears there may be a coverage problem requiring a solution. Nothing in the Town's actions thus far shows an unwillingness to acknowledge a problem or to permit the crafting of a solution. The record suggests a range of possible solutions, none yet determined to be infeasible, ranging from more co-location on existing towers in nearby towns, to the construction of less aesthetically disruptive towers in Pelham, to the placement of towers along median strips. Those are the sorts of choices and trade-offs which the Act permits towns to make in the first instance. <i>See Amherst,</i> 173 F.3d at 15; <i>Aegerter v.

There is no more room on the tower used by carrier A to add the other carriers and the town denies a permit to build a tower in the only other feasible location.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">3) Carrier A, using a minority technology, provides service in a gap.

The majority of calls fail in a new geographic gap but occasionally some go through. The carriers want to build a new tower in the only feasible location so the customers can receive uninterrupted service. The town denies a permit.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">5) A new generation of technology emerges but it cannot compete with older technologies because carriers using the new technology cannot build towers in the only feasible locations.

The federal district court, on cross motions for summary judgment, rejected the landowner's claims that (1) the ZBA decision was not supported by substantial evidence and (2) the decision was an unlawful effective prohibition on the provision of wireless services. In doing so, the district court adopted a rule that so long as any carrier provides service in the area, there is never a basis for a claim that a town has effectively prohibited personal wireless service, in violation of the Act, by preventing other carriers from filling a significant geographic gap in their cellular networks. This holding raises a novel and interesting question. We disagree with the district court's rule, but affirm on other grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second Generation planned to build on its land in Pelham<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> a telecommunications tower which would permit carriers to provide service along N.H. Route 128, a state highway. Pelham has four commercial cell towers, one approved after the ZBA denied Second Generation's first variance application. Pelham has six licensed, operating wireless carriers: Voicestream Communications; AT &amp; T Wireless; Sprint PCS; Verizon; U.S. Cellular; and Nextel Communications (as they are currently known). Cingular Wireless is not among them. Second Generation owns a ninety acre, heavily wooded lot at the top of Seavy Hill (also called Spaulding Hill) directly above a portion of Route 128, which runs through a narrow valley between two ridges of hills. Daily traffic on this portion ranges from 10,000 cars, just south of N.H. Route 111A, to around 4,500 cars, north of Route 111A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two wireless carriers, AT &amp; T Wireless and Voicestream, originally committed to use the Second Generation tower, but Voicestream withdrew from its agreement, leaving only AT &amp; T under contract. Two other carriers, Sprint PCS and Nextel, had expressed interest in using the proposed tower.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, Second Generation applied for a special exception to erect a 400-foot cell tower on Spaulding Hill. The zoning ordinance then provided that communications towers in residential zones were a permitted use, subject to obtaining a special exception. The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) denied the request for a special exception on June 8, 1998. Second Generation appealed to the state Superior Court, which upheld the decision. Second Generation then applied to build a smaller, 250-foot cell tower.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1999, the town passed a Personal Wireless Services Ordinance which authorizes the town's Planning Board to issue conditional use permits for the construction of cell towers in a newly established \"Telecommunications Overlay Zone.\" The Overlay Zone includes only areas currently zoned for industrial and commercial uses, and is separated from Route 128 by hills. A variance must be obtained from the ZBA to construct a tower outside the Overlay Zone. Since Second Generation's property is in a residential zone, it needed a variance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 2000, Second Generation filed a federal court complaint alleging that the ordinance violated the TCA by effectively prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, in violation of 47 U.S.C. &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(II) (2000), and unreasonably discriminating against some licensed wireless carriers, in violation of &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I). It also brought a claim against the town under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000). The court issued a stay in August 2000 to allow Second Generation to seek a variance from the ZBA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the ZBA variance hearing, Second Generation presented testimony from its engineers (one a Voicestream employee), consultants (one from AT &amp; T), attorneys, and its general partner. Representatives of AT &amp; T and Voicestream stated that their networks had coverage gaps on Route 128.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Blaine Hopkins, a Second Generation consultant, purported to show that the presence of a cell tower has no impact on property values, and that the alleged gaps could not be serviced by existing Pelham towers or new 190-foot towers in the Overlay Zone. A Second Generation executive testified that the cell tower would generate less noise and traffic than would a single residence, that the surrounding topography would hide the lower part of the tower, and that research by a local appraiser confirmed that the tower would not diminish the value of surrounding properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Numerous abutters and other Pelham residents testified that the tower would interfere with their view and spoil the pristine character of the neighborhood. Three abutters said that the tower would diminish property values; one reported that local real estate firms had informed him that the surrounding homes would be devalued by approximately fifteen percent. A ZBA member, also a realtor, strongly criticized the methodology used in Mr. Hopkins's analysis of the impact of cell towers on property values.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Two residents contended that the Second Generation property could be put to other uses: for agriculture, residential development, tree harvesting, or elderly housing. One abutter and one ZBA member stated that they had phone service within the alleged gap. A resident also testified that the area could be largely served by a tower in a commercial zone in Dracut, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board voted unanimously to deny the variance on the ground that Second Generation failed to prove \"hardship\" as required by New Hampshire law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second Generation amended its complaint to challenge the ZBA decision as well as the ordinance. It alleged that Pelham had instituted an \"absolute prohibition\" against the construction of cell towers in residential zones, that at least four of the six licensed wireless carriers had significant coverage gaps along Route 128, and that it would be impossible to eliminate these gaps without building a cell tower in a residential zone. The ordinance and waiver, it asserted, violated 47 U.S.C. &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(i) by effectively prohibiting wireless service and unreasonably discriminating against the four carriers. It also added new claims that the ZBA's waiver denial was not supported by adequate written findings or substantial evidence in the record, in violation of &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(iii). Second Generation dropped its 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 claim and its request for damages; it now requested only that the court enjoin the town ordinance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the ZBA decision, the New Hampshire Supreme Court decided <i>Simplex Technologies, Inc. v.

In May 2001, both parties filed summary judgment motions. On June 27, 2001, the district court remanded the case to the ZBA for a redetermination of hardship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the ZBA hearing on September 24, 2001, Second Generation presented testimony from two experts and two attorneys; several residents again testified in opposition. The hearing yielded the following new information. The Pelham Planning Director testified that the Planning Board was considering proposed subdivisions with approximately forty-five homes near the Second Generation tract. Second Generation's radio frequency engineer, Anthony Wells, presented a propagation study purporting to show that the alleged gap could not be serviced by existing Pelham towers, new 195-foot towers in the Overlay Zone, or an existing tower in Hudson, New Hampshire. Second Generation also made a number of concessions. First, Second Generation experts acknowledged that the company's tract was not the only site that could provide coverage in the alleged gap. Second, they did not contest that a tower shorter than 250 feet could allow a limited number of carriers to service the alleged gap. Second Generation executives later said that they were willing to settle, at least temporarily, for a variance to build a 199-foot tower. Finally, when counsel to an abutter stated that carriers in New Hampshire can enter into right-of-way leases along state highways, Second Generation acknowledged that it had not explored this option and was unsure about its effectiveness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ZBA denied the waiver in a written decision dated September 27, 2001, finding that Second Generation did not meet <i>any</i> of the five conditions for obtaining a waiver, and, more specifically, that Second Generation had failed to meet any of the three unnecessary hardship criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties again filed cross-motions for summary judgment in district court and agreed to resolve the case essentially on a case-stated basis. The court had before it the record developed as a result of the ZBA hearings; for the effective prohibition claim, it also considered other evidence submitted by the parties in support of their motions. Second Generation submitted affidavits that four of the six carriers licensed to provide wireless services in Pelham experienced gaps in coverage along Route 128, but that one licensed carrier, U.S. Cellular, had roaming coverage in the alleged gap via the network of Cingular Wireless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 21, 2002, the district court granted Pelham's motion for summary judgment and denied Second Generation's motion. <i>Second Generation Props., L.P. v.

May 21, 2002). The court held that Second Generation did not meet its burden to show that there was a significant gap in coverage or its burden to show that the gap could not be filled by other means. It found that a gap is significant only if the area in question is not served by <i>any</i> carrier. <i>Id.</i> at *3. The court found that U.S. Cellular provided roaming service and Nextel might provide regular service along the relevant portion of Route 128. <i>Id.</i> It noted that Second Generation's propagation study did not consider the possibility that a carrier could obtain a waiver of the Ordinance's 199-foot height limitation and build a taller tower in the Overlay Zone. <i>Id.</i> In addition, the court observed that Second Generation failed to investigate whether other sites outside the Overlay Zone could provide the necessary service. <i>Id.</i> The district court also held that substantial evidence supported the ZBA's decision to deny the waiver. <i>Id.</i> at *4-*5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The TCA preserves state and local authority over the siting and construction of wireless communication facilities, subject to five exceptions specified in the Act. 47 U.S.C. &#167; 332(c)(7)(B); <i>see Town of Amherst v.

Several of the residences that would be affected by the proposed tower have deed restrictions protecting their views. Further, while only a limited number of existing residences would have a view of the tower, it is unclear whether it would also impair the views of any of the homes that are likely to be built in several proposed subdivisions in the area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Second Generation,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1018923</span></span>, at *5.

Instead, this is simply an instance in which the district court reviewed the record developed by the Board and provided more detail than did the Board in its decision.

This in turn raises a series of issues inherent in the \"effective prohibition\" analysis, including the requirements to show an effective prohibition; the contours of the \"significant gap\" formulation previously used by this court; and the relevance of evidence of coverage provided by roaming service, towers in other towns, and carriers not licensed in the town. Most significantly, it raises the question of the correctness of the rule adopted by the district court that if any carrier provides any coverage within a purported gap, then there cannot, as a matter of law, be an effective prohibition on the provision of wireless services. We disagree with and reject any such rule, but ultimately agree with the court's alternate ground for holding that there was no effective prohibition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Scope of Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the substantial evidence issue, the issue of whether the ZBA has prohibited or effectively prohibited the provision of wireless services is determined de novo by the district court. <i>Nat'l Tower,</i> 297 F.3d at 22.

Since board actions will be invalidated by a federal court if they violate the effective prohibition provision, many boards wisely do consider the point. <i>See, e.g., Amherst,</i> 173 F.3d at 16. There appears to be nothing in New Hampshire law to preclude a board from considering the issue.

That attack is meritless. The Ordinance does not restrict the power to grant variances to build towers in other districts, the town has allowed four commercial towers to be constructed, and the town has not said as a categorical matter that it would never grant a variance outside the Overlay Zone.

We have concluded that a town's refusal to permit a tower that is needed to fill a \"significant [geographic] gap\" in service, where no service at all is offered in the gap, would violate the effective prohibition clause. <i>See Nat'l Tower,</i> 297 F.3d at 20; <i>accord Willoth,</i> 176 F.3d at 643; APT <i>Pittsburgh Ltd. P'ship,</i> 196 F.3d at 480. The context in which a question arises is important. In <i>National Tower,</i> where this circuit adopted and employed a significant gap analysis, it was undisputed that no carrier provided coverage in the geographic gap area and that the gap affected the ability of a large number of users to connect or maintain a connection, <i>id.</i> at 17-18. The issue addressed in <i>National Tower</i> by the \"significant gap\" formulation, then, had to do with when a purported geographic gap, served by no carrier, is large enough in terms of physical size and number of users affected to amount to an effective prohibition, rather than being a mere, and statutorily permissible, dead spot. Federal regulations contemplate that areas enjoying adequate coverage will still include spots without reliable service. <i>See 360 Degrees Communications Co.,</i> 211 F.3d at 87; 47 C.F.R. &#167; 22.911(b) (2001); <i>see also id.</i> &#167; 22.99 (defining dead spots as \"[s]mall areas within a service area where the field strength is lower than the minimum level for reliable service\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like many legal concepts, the \"significant gap\" language used in one context is now being used by the parties to address a qualitatively different and much more complex set of problems. The parties use the phrase to frame arguments about whether an effective prohibition can exist in a geographic area where a carrier already provides some service. The ultimate question of course remains whether a given decision, ordinance, or policy amounts to an effective prohibition on the delivery of wireless services. Inquiries into the existence and type of gap are merely helpful analytic tools toward that end.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. <i>Consideration of Services by Out-of-town Carriers</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second Generation attempts to buttress its argument by saying the coverage that does exist should be ignored and so this is actually a situation where no carrier provides coverage. The only carriers that provide coverage in the purported gap are U.S. Cellular, which provides roaming service via the Cingular Wireless network, and Cingular Wireless, which is not licensed in Pelham and provides service from a tower in Dracut, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second Generation raises a question of law as to whether the town or court may consider service by these carriers. In ascertaining the existence and extent of coverage for purposes of resolving an effective prohibition claim (and indeed the proposed solution), we hold it permissible to consider (1) roaming service, (2) the coverage provided from towers in other towns, and (3) service by carriers not licensed in the jurisdiction at issue. <i>See Cellular Tel. Co.,</i> 197 F.3d at 71 (\"Under the right conditions it may be possible to provide an adequate level of personal wireless services to a particular community solely through facilities located outside that community.\"); <i>accord Omnipoint Communications MB Operations, LLC v.

Both these arguments overlook the fact that licensed carriers may be able to co-locate on the same (existing) tower(s) used by out-of-town carriers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The argument, moreover, runs contrary to the TCA's emphasis on protecting the interests of consumers and residents rather than those of carriers and developers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Rejection of Rule That Any Coverage Equals No Effective Prohibition</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case squarely raises the issue, which has divided the courts, of whether there can ever be an effective prohibition of personal wireless service if there is any carrier that provides coverage in the geographic gap area. The district court, following the Third Circuit holding in <i>APT Pittsburgh Ltd. Partnership,</i> 196 F.3d at 480, adopted the rule that if any coverage is provided in the gap area by any carrier (including roaming service through a tower in a different town) then there can be no effective prohibition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A flat \"any service equals no effective prohibition\" rule would say a town could refuse permits to build the towers necessary to solve any number of different coverage problems.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> It is highly unlikely that Congress intended the many qualitatively different and complex problems to be lumped together and solved by a rule for all seasons that any coverage in a gap area automatically defeats an effective prohibition claim. Such a rule would be highly problematic because it does not further the interests of the individual consumer. To use an example from this case, it is of little comfort to the customer who uses AT &amp;T Wireless (or Voicestream, Verizon, Sprint, or Nextel) who cannot get service along the significant geographic gap which may exist along Route 128 that a Cingular Wireless customer does get some service in that gap. Of course, that AT &amp; T customer could switch to Cingular Wireless. But were the rule adopted, the same customer might well find that she has a significant gap in coverage a few towns over, where AT &amp; T Wireless, her former provider, offers service but Cingular Wireless does not. The result would be a crazy patchwork quilt of intermittent coverage. That quilt might have the effect of driving the industry toward a single carrier. When Congress enacted legislation to promote the construction of a nationwide cellular network, such a consequence was not, we think, the intended result, <i>see, e.g.,</i> S.Rep. No. 104-23, Purpose of the Bill (1995), <i>reprinted in 1 Federal Telecommunications Law, supra,</i> doc. 2, at 1 (bill aims to \"open[] all telecommunications markets to competition\"); H.R.Rep.

We start with the fact that Congress used \"services\" and not \"service.\" A straightforward reading is that \"services\" refers to more than one carrier. Congress contemplated that there be multiple carriers competing to provide services to consumers. That one carrier provides some service in a geographic gap should not lead to abandonment of examination of the effect on wireless services for other carriers and their customers. Next, the phrase \"have the effect of prohibiting\" may well refer to actions that mostly prohibit. For example, B.A. Garner, <i>A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage</i> 256 (2d ed. 1995), gives as the first definition of effective \"having a <i>high degree</i> of effect.\" (emphasis added). <i>Accord</i> B.A. Garner, <i>A Dictionary of Modern American Usage</i> 237-38 (1998). Moreover, a common reading of the word \"prohibition\" standing alone would apply to a situation of denial of services to the vast majority of users. <i>See, e.g., Oxford English Dictionary</i> (2d ed. 1989) (defining \"prohibit\" as \"to prevent, preclude, <i>hinder</i>\") (emphasis added). Thus Congress may well have meant the effective prohibition clause to reach certain situations in which there is some coverage in a gap.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One might hypothesize that the \"unreasonable discrimination\" language of the Act would adequately address situations where customers of some but not all carriers lack service in an area. The argument would proceed that the anti-prohibition clause should be strictly read as applying only to de jure and de facto absolute prohibitions. This court has not yet explicated the unreasonable discrimination clause and we do not do so here. Nevertheless, the law from other circuits gives little reason to think this clause will effectively safeguard congressional efforts to promote the building of a nationwide cellular network. Some courts have held that towns can discriminate against proposals that have different aesthetic or safety ramifications, <i>Willoth,</i> 176 F.3d at 638-39; <i>see also</i> H.R.Rep.

An applicant for a zoning permit arguing that there is an effective prohibition must still show that there are no alternative sites which would solve the problem. Importantly, if an existing carrier provides service, then by definition there is a tower used by that owner, and the tower may offer the possibility of co-location. If co-location on such a tower is not possible, there may be other solutions that the town regards as more palatable than the applicant's proposed tower. Finally, even if there were a significant coverage problem in terms of a number of different carriers being unable to provide service to a significant number of users, we think a town would be entitled to consider whether a particular proposed tower would solve the problem for a smaller or larger number of providers. Here, the firm evidence was that a tower on Second Generation's property would assist two of the carriers. Little evidence was submitted about whether it would solve the purported problem for the other four licensed carriers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Effective Prohibition and Other Potential Solutions</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dispositively on the effective prohibition issue, the record shows that Second Generation has not met its burden to show that there are no other potential solutions to the purported problem. Specifically, Second Generation failed to show that a taller tower (for which a height variance would be needed) could not be built in the Overlay Zone to remedy the alleged gap. Nor did it show that no other feasible sites existed outside of the Overlay Zone or that the ZBA would deny variances for such sites. Second Generation's own experts acknowledged that its land was not the only location where a tower could provide coverage in the purported gap and that its proposed tower was likely taller than necessary to service the alleged gap. Second Generation also failed to explore whether existing towers in nearby jurisdictions (which enabled U.S. Cellular customers to obtain roaming service) could provide other carriers with coverage in the purported gap.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though Second Generation has not on this record demonstrated that this individual denial of a permit constituted an effective prohibition, it appears there may be a coverage problem requiring a solution. Nothing in the Town's actions thus far shows an unwillingness to acknowledge a problem or to permit the crafting of a solution. The record suggests a range of possible solutions, none yet determined to be infeasible, ranging from more co-location on existing towers in nearby towns, to the construction of less aesthetically disruptive towers in Pelham, to the placement of towers along median strips. Those are the sorts of choices and trade-offs which the Act permits towns to make in the first instance. <i>See Amherst,</i> 173 F.3d at 15; <i>Aegerter v.

The question of rejection of the least intrusive means must itself be evaluated in the context of the other options available. <i>See 360 Degrees Communications Co. v.

L.J. 373, 386-87 (2000) (observing that \"co-location\" on the same tower of antennas belonging to multiple carriers has become an increasingly common practice). We would view very differently a case in which a town attempted to deflect onto another jurisdiction the need to build new towers necessary to provide services to meet the TCA's goals where no service has been provided.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> The district court also thought the Second Circuit had adopted such a rule in<i>Sprint Spectrum L.P. v.

We read the case differently. The relevant passage appears to hold that once a carrier has adequate (though less than perfect) service in an area, local boards can deny applications by that carrier for additional towers without violating the effective prohibition clause. <i>Id.</i> at 643. This reading is buttressed by the context in which this passage appears: the following two paragraphs explain that there is no effective prohibition because Sprint could provide adequate coverage with just one or two towers rather than the three towers it requested in its application. <i>Id.</i> at 643-44. The court's effective prohibition analysis does not discuss the provision of wireless services by other carriers. <i>Id.</i> at 639-44. Furthermore, its stress on adequate coverage should logically mean that circuit would oppose an \"any coverage equals no gap\" rule. <i>See id.</i> at 643 (\"Furthermore, once an area is <i>sufficiently</i> serviced by a wireless service provider, the right to deny applications becomes broader: State and local governments may deny subsequent applications without thereby violating subsection B(i)(II).\") (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Problems could arise in the following situations</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">1) The only carrier providing service in a gap area does not provide service nationwide. The established carriers want to fill a significant geographic gap in their nationwide networks by constructing a tower in the town. The town denies the established carriers' application to build a tower in the only feasible location on the ground that a carrier already provides service in the town.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">2) A gap is served by carrier A, which provides coverage for 1% of the cell phone users in the area. Some 99% of local users, who subscribe to different carriers, have no service in the gap. There is no more room on the tower used by carrier A to add the other carriers and the town denies a permit to build a tower in the only other feasible location.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">3) Carrier A, using a minority technology, provides service in a gap. A town then refuses to permit the construction of a tower to serve the carriers who use the alternative and prevalent technology. Or vice-versa. There are no feasible alternatives.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">4) Carriers first provide service in the geographic gap to a small percentage of potential users and then the number of subscribers grows exponentially such that there is a deterioration of services. The majority of calls fail in a new geographic gap but occasionally some go through. The carriers want to build a new tower in the only feasible location so the customers can receive uninterrupted service. The town denies a permit.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">5) A new generation of technology emerges but it cannot compete with older technologies because carriers using the new technology cannot build towers in the only feasible locations. The town denies permits on the ground that old technology carriers already provide service in the area.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> That the district court's rule may have some anti-competitive effects seems reasonable.
