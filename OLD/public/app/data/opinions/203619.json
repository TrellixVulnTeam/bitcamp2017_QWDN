Rya W. Zobel,       U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                          Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     William Pimental on brief pro se.\n     Scott A. Katz, Assistant Attorney General, and Martha\nCoakley, Attorney General, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             January 9, 2009\n\f            Per Curiam.      In this petition for habeas relief under 28\n\nU.S.C. ยง 2254, we affirm the judgment substantially for the reasons\n\nrecited in the district court's decision, adding only the following\n\ncomments.\n\n            Although petitioner filed a formal notice of appeal\n\noutside the normal 30-day appeal period, he filed a COA application\n\nand an accompanying affidavit within that period.               We find these\n\ndocuments to be the \"functional equivalent\" of a notice of appeal,\n\nsince   they       gave   the   \"pertinent      information\"    and   \"plainly\n\nevidence[d] an intention to appeal.\" Campiti v. Matesanz, 333 F.3d\n\n317, 320 (1st Cir. 2003).         As respondent acknowledges, the appeal\n\nis thus timely.\n\n            Petitioner challenges the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nshowing that he was in constructive possession of a stash of\n\ncocaine, which was found in the basement of the house in which he\n\nand   his   wife    lived.      Proof   of    constructive   possession   under\n\nMassachusetts law requires two elements: (1) knowledge, and (2) the\n\nability and intention to exercise dominion and control. See, e.g.,\n\nCommonwealth v. Sespedes, 810 N.E.2d 790, 793 (Mass. 2004).                 At\n\ntrial, petitioner sought to rebut this theory by arguing that the\n\nhouse was a two-family dwelling and the basement was a common area.\n\nThe Appeals Court held that the evidence on this point, although\n\n\"somewhat inconsistent,\" was sufficient to warrant submission to\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fthe jury.   Commonwealth v. Pimental, 2006 WL 2355482, at *2 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 2006).\n\n            As an aside, we note that petitioner's challenge would\n\nlikely fall short even on the arguendo assumption that the house\n\nwas a two-family dwelling.         Cf. Commonwealth v. Velasquez, 718\n\nN.E.2d 398, 402 (Mass. App. Ct. 1999) (\"That others in the building\n\nalso had access to the basement and might have hidden drugs in the\n\nbasement does not require a finding of not guilty in favor of\n\nVelasquez.\"); Commonwealth v. Montanez, 571 N.E.2d 1372, 1383\n\n(Mass. 1991) (similar).      But no such assumption need be made here,\n\nfor when the record \"supports conflicting inferences,\" a federal\n\nhabeas court \"must presume ... that the trier of fact resolved any\n\nsuch conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that\n\nresolution.\"     Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 326 (1979).            We\n\ncan thus proceed on the assumption that the house was a one-family\n\ndwelling.\n\n            A   challenge   to   the   sufficiency   of   the   evidence   is\n\ngoverned by the constitutional standard set forth in Jackson:\n\n\"whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nthe prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the\n\nessential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Id. at\n\n319 (emphasis deleted).      As the district court properly observed,\n\n\"the inquiry is not whether the Appeals Court was correct in\n\nfinding the evidence of constructive possession sufficient to\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fsupport a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, but rather whether\n\nits judgment amounted to a decision that unreasonably applied\n\nJackson.\"    Pimental v. Spencer, 2008 WL 2066967, at *3 (D. Mass.\n\n2008) (applying 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d)); accord, e.g., Hurtado v.\n\nTucker, 245 F.3d 7, 14-20 (1st Cir. 2001).                For the reasons\n\nenumerated by the district court, the Appeals Court cannot be said\n\nto have unreasonably applied the Jackson standard.               See Pimental,\n\n2008 WL 2066967, at *3-*4 (describing circumstantial evidence of\n\nguilt and noting lack of any indication \"that the Appeals Court\n\nignored material evidence or failed to give appropriate weight to\n\nall of the evidence\").\n\n            Petitioner properly acknowledges in his brief that he\n\nfaces   a   \"heavy   burden\"   in    seeking   habeas   relief    based    on   a\n\nchallenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.               In Hurtado, we\n\nstated that, \"as a general rule,\"\n\n            federal courts should be particularly cautious\n            about issuing habeas, on grounds of the\n            objective unreasonableness of a state court's\n            conclusion that the evidence is sufficient,\n            where there has been a verdict of guilt by a\n            jury of a defendant's peers, where the\n            defendant's credibility was evaluated by the\n            jury hearing his testimony, where that verdict\n            has been affirmed on appeal in the state\n            system, and where there is no claim of\n            constitutional error in the conduct of the\n            trial.\n\n245 F.3d at 19-20.         Although one distinguishing factor is that\n\npetitioner    here   did    not     testify,   we   nonetheless     find   this\n\ncautionary note equally applicable in the present case.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -5-\n\f",
