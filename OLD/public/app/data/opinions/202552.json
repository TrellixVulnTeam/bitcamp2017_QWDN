Gilberto Santa-Rosa (\"Santa\n\nRosa\") sued Combo Records (\"Combo\"), its owners, insurers, and\n\ndistributors, seeking compensation for the sales of five albums he\n\nrecorded more than fifteen years ago, and which Combo has been\n\nselling ever since.      The district court dismissed all of Santa\n\nRosa's claims.    Santa Rosa now appeals the dismissal of two of his\n\nclaims: his claim for rescission of his recording contract, and his\n\nclaim for a declaratory judgment that he has an ownership interest\n\nin the recordings.     After careful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                             I.   Background\n\n             Santa Rosa is an accomplished salsa singer, producer, and\n\ncomposer.1    He lives in Puerto Rico and is known as the \"Caballero\n\nde la Salsa.\"    Combo is a record production company owned by Ralph\n\nCartagena and located in New York. Santa Rosa states that sometime\n\nbetween 1984 and 1986, he and Combo came to an agreement by which\n\nhe agreed to record four albums for Combo and Combo agreed to pay\n\nhim \"artist royalties\" for all albums sold.      Santa Rosa no longer\n\n\n\n\n1\n   See, e.g., Robert Domínguez, Maite Junco and Leo Standora,\nShakira Crowned New Latin Queen, N.Y. Daily News, Nov. 3, 2006 at\n2 (\"Popular Puerto Rican singer Gilberto Santa Rosa, known as The\nGentleman of Salsa [won a Latin Grammy for] Best Salsa Album\");\nDavid Cazares, Salsa, Merengue Away at Carnaval Miami, Fort\nLauderdale Sun-Times, Feb. 21, 1997 at 19 (\"Gilberto Santa Rosa,\nthe young bandleader and singer whose music is among the most\ncomplex and challenging being produced, performs with a traditional\nband that includes a large horn section.\"); Jon Pareles, Pop and\nJazz in Review, N.Y. Times., July 30, 1992 at C16 (\"Gilberto Santa\nRosa [is] one of Puerto Rico's most popular young singers.\").\n\n                                   -2-\n\fhas a copy of the purported agreement, but claims that a copy of\n\nthis agreement exists and that Combo has it.\n\n          Santa Rosa recorded four albums between 1986 and 1989 for\n\nCombo, including \"Good Vibrations\" (1986), \"Keeping Cool\" (1987),\n\n\"De Amor y de Salsa\" (1988), and \"Salsa en Movimiento\" (1989).2\n\nCombo later released \"El Caballero de la Salsa,\" a compilation of\n\nSanta Rosa songs. Combo paid $11,280 in advance royalties to Santa\n\nRosa between 1986 and 1989.   Since 1989, Combo states that it has\n\n\"continued to manufacture, distribute, and sell thousands of the\n\nalbums and compilations [but Combo] has never paid Santa Rosa any\n\nadditional royalties or given him royalty statements for the sale\n\nof the aforementioned albums.\"        Santa Rosa had not requested\n\nadditional royalties until he brought the present suit.\n\n          On May 7, 2004, Santa Rosa and his then-wife, Nélida\n\nAcevedo Rivera, filed suit against Combo, Ralph Cartagena, Combo's\n\ninsurance company, and all record distributors or other persons\n\nliable for the acts of Combo, seeking rescission of his contract\n\nbased on material breach and damages for unjust enrichment.     On\n\nOctober 13, 2004, Santa Rosa filed an amended complaint which added\n\nclaims for a declaratory judgment as to the ownership of the\n\nrecordings and a violation of the Lanham Act.3      On October 18,\n\n\n2\n   Santa Rosa was the performing artist on these records; he does\nnot claim to have been the composer.\n3\n   Santa Rosa declined to appeal the dismissal of his claims for\nunjust enrichment and violations of the Lanham Act.\n\n                                -3-\n\f2004, Combo filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.       On\n\nJune 28, 2005, the district court granted Combo's motion to dismiss\n\nwith prejudice.   Santa Rosa filed a motion for reconsideration on\n\nJuly 14, 2005 which the district court denied on May 1, 2006.\n\nSanta Rosa now appeals from the dismissal of his complaint.\n\n                          II.   Discussion\n\n          We review a decision to grant a motion to dismiss de\n\nnovo, taking as true the well-pleaded facts of the complaint. Isla\n\nNena Air Svcs., Inc. v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 449 F.3d 85, 87 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).   Dismissal is appropriate only if \"it is clear that no\n\nrelief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved\n\nconsistent with the allegations.\" Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534\n\nU.S. 506, 514 (2002) (internal citation and quotations omitted).\n\nHowever, we need not only consider the grounds for dismissal relied\n\nupon by the district court; we may affirm a dismissal on \"any\n\nground fairly presented by the record.\"       Gabriel v. Preble, 396\n\nF.3d 10, 12 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                     A.   Claim for Rescission\n\n          Santa Rosa's first claim against Combo is that Combo\n\nmaterially breached his contract. As such, Santa Rosa contends, he\n\nis entitled to rescission of that contract.      Combo responded, and\n\nthe district court held, that Santa Rosa had failed to adequately\n\nplead the existence of a contract.     We need not resolve the dispute\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fover whether a contract had been sufficiently pled.4         Even assuming\n\nthat a contract between Santa Rosa and Combo existed, we find that\n\nSanta   Rosa's   claim   for   rescission   would   be   preempted   by   the\n\nCopyright Act.\n\n           A cause of action is preempted under the Copyright Act,\n\n17 U.S.C. § 301(a), if it does not require an element beyond \"mere\n\ncopying, preparation of derivative works, performance, distribution\n\nor display.\"      Data Gen. Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp., 36\n\nF.3d 1147, 1164 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting Gates Rubber Co. v. Bando\n\nChem Indus., Ltd., 9 F.3d 823, 847 (10th Cir. 1993)).                We have\n\nnever squarely decided the question of whether a simple breach of\n\ncontract action that only seeks damages would be preempted by the\n\nCopyright Act.5    We need not do so today because Santa Rosa asks\n\nnot for damages, but rather for rescission of his contract.            As we\n\nnoted in Royal v. Leading Edge Products, Inc., Santa Rosa's claim\n\n\n\n4\n    Indeed, both parties seem conflicted on the issue.        Combo\nadmitted that a contract existed, but later suggested that no\ncontract ever existed, and that if it did, its contents could never\nbe proven. Santa Rosa never doubted the existence of the contract,\nbut alleged at various points that it was a written contract, an\noral contract, and a contract implied-in-fact.\n5\n   Some courts have suggested that a simple breach of contract\nclaim would not be preempted. See, e.g., Ritchie v. Williams, 395\nF.3d 283, 289 (6th Cir. 2005)(holding that causes of action which\nincluded substantive elements not implicating \"ownership or\ninfringement\" were not preempted because they were substantively\ndifferent); Warren v. Fox Family Worldwide, Inc., 171 F. Supp. 2d\n1057, 1073 (C.D. Cal. 2001) (finding that there was no Copyright\nAct preemption where \"there is an express contractual obligation to\npay royalties\").\n\n                                    -5-\n\ffor rescission of his royalty contract presents an interesting\n\nquagmire:\n\n             [I]f the royalty agreement stands, then the\n             plaintiff's sole remedy for the breach of it\n             would be money damages -- and the Copyright\n             Act need not be construed. If, however, as\n             plaintiff suggests, the royalty agreement is\n             subject to rescission because of defendant's\n             material breach thereof, then that agreement\n             would vanish.\n\n833 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1987).                 Because a successful claim for\n\nrescission would result in there being no \"'written instrument'\n\nsigned by the parties,\" we would be required to resort to the\n\ninterpretation of 17 U.S.C. § 201(b) to determine ownership of\n\nSanta Rosa's recordings.          Id.; see also Rano v. Sipa Press, Inc.,\n\n987   F.2d   580,    586   (9th    Cir.    1993)    (\"After    [an   agreement   is\n\nrescinded], any further distribution would constitute copyright\n\ninfringement.\").\n\n             Because Santa Rosa seeks rescission of his contract, if\n\nwe were to grant him the relief that he sought, we would be\n\nrequired to determine his ownership rights by reference to the\n\nCopyright Act.       In such a case, there is little question that we\n\nwould be merely determining whether Santa Rosa was entitled to\n\ncompensation        because   of     \"mere       copying\"     or     \"performance,\n\ndistribution or display\" of his recordings.                  Data Gen. Corp., 36\n\nF.3d at 1164.       As such, 17 U.S.C. § 301(a) preempts Santa Rosa's\n\nrescission    claim.       Once    it     is    determined    that   Santa   Rosa's\n\nrescission claim is preempted, his only remedy is a claim under the\n\n                                          -6-\n\fCopyright Act, and \"the court must then dismiss the [contract]\n\nclaim for failing to state a cause of action.\" Briarpatch Ltd. v.\n\nPhoenix Pictures, Inc., 373 F.3d 296, 309 (2d Cir. 2004).           Thus, we\n\nfind no error in the dismissal of Santa Rosa's rescission claim.\n\n                    B.   Claim for Declaratory Judgment\n\n             Because Santa Rosa's rescission claim is preempted, we\n\nare   left   only   with   his   claim   for   a   declaratory   judgment    of\n\nownership, which arises under the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 201.\n\nSanta Rosa claimed that the courts should resolve the \"uncertainty\"\n\nover ownership of his recordings by issuing a declaratory judgment\n\nthat he is the sole owner of those recordings.              Combo responded\n\nthat Santa Rosa's declaratory judgment action was time barred. The\n\ndistrict court agreed that Santa Rosa's claim was barred by the\n\nstatute of limitations and granted Combo's motion to dismiss.               See\n\nLaChapelle v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., 142 F.3d 507, 509 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (holding that dismissal is appropriate if the plaintiff's\n\nallegations \"leave no doubt\" that the statute of limitations would\n\nbar the claim).          We agree with the district court that the\n\ndeclaratory judgment action is time barred and that dismissal was\n\nappropriate.6\n\n\n6\n   Because we find Santa Rosa's declaratory judgment action time-\nbarred, we find no need to address, and we express no opinion as\nto, Combo's argument that Santa Rosa's cause of action is also\nbarred because Santa Rosa failed to comply with 17 U.S.C. § 411(a),\nwhich states that \"no action for infringement of the copyright in\nany United States work shall be instituted until preregistration or\nregistration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance\n\n                                     -7-\n\f             17 U.S.C. § 507(b) provides that \"[n]o civil action shall\n\nbe maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is\n\ncommenced within three years after the claim accrued.\"             A claim\n\naccrues when \"the plaintiff 'knows or has reason to know of the act\n\nwhich   is    the   basis   for   the    claim.'\"      Rodríguez-García   v.\n\nMunicipality of Caguas, 354 F.3d 91, 96-97 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting\n\nRodríguez Nárvaez v. Nazario, 895 F.2d 38, 41 n.5 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\nThus, a claim for declaratory judgment of ownership accrues when\n\nthe plaintiff \"knew of the alleged grounds for the [ownership]\n\nclaim.\"      Margo v. Weiss, 213 F.3d 55, 60-61 (2d Cir. 2000); see\n\nalso Merchant v. Levy, 92 F.3d 51, 56 (2d Cir. 1996)(\"[N]o . . .\n\nuncertainty      exists     as    to    co-ownership    rights   based    on\n\nco-authorship. A co-author knows that he or she jointly created a\n\nwork from the moment of its creation.\").            It goes without saying\n\nthat Santa Rosa was present when his performances were recorded by\n\nCombo Records, and thus knew from the moment that each recording\n\nwas created that he had a potential claim for ownership of it.\n\nThus, there is little question that Santa Rosa's claims for co-\n\nownership accrued as soon as he finished recording each album.7\n\n\nwith this title.\"\n7\n   At oral argument, Santa Rosa's counsel noted the distinction\nbetween copyrights on compositions (i.e. the music and lyrics) and\non performances of those compositions (i.e. the tangible, fixed\nrepresentation of the music and lyrics). See generally 6 David\nNimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 30.03 (2006) (\"Copyright ownership of\nthe physical embodiment of the performance of a musical composition\n(e.g., a master recording) is distinct from the ownership of the\n\n                                        -8-\n\f          Santa Rosa points to the Ninth Circuit's holding in Zuill\n\nv. Shanahan that a claim for a declaratory judgment would not\n\naccrue until a \"plain and express repudiation of co-ownership is\n\ncommunicated to the claimant.\" 80 F.3d 1366, 1369 (9th Cir. 1996).\n\nEven applying this test for accrual of a claim, we cannot think of\n\na more plain and express repudiation of co-ownership than the fact\n\nthat Combo openly, and quite notoriously, sold Santa Rosa's records\n\nwithout providing payment to him: according to documents provided\n\nby Santa Rosa, at least 1,140 of the recordings in dispute were\n\nsold during the six month period between January and June of 2000,\n\nalmost four years before Santa Rosa filed suit in May 2004.\n\nLikewise, it is hard to believe that a singer of Santa Rosa's\n\nstature would have been unaware that Combo Records was selling his\n\nrecordings and thus claiming ownership over them until three years\n\nbefore this action was commenced.\n\n          Because we conclude that Santa Rosa had reason to know of\n\nhis claim of ownership over the recordings soon after they were\n\ncreated (which was well over three years before Santa Rosa filed\n\n\n\ncopyright in the musical composition itself and usually is the\nsubject of an overall contractual relationship between its\nperformers and a record company.\"). However, we see no logical\ndistinction to be made between a composer, who learns of his\nownership claim when he transcribes his music onto a sheet, and\nSanta Rosa, who learned of his ownership claim when he performed\nhis music in a record studio. In both cases, the \"author\" is \"the\nperson who translates an idea into a fixed, tangible expression\nentitled to copyright protection.\" Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence\nv. Reid, 490 U.S. 730, 737 (1989).\n\n                               -9-\n\fsuit against Combo), we agree with the district court that Santa\n\nRosa's declaratory judgment action is time barred by 17 U.S.C.\n\n§ 507(b).\n\n                          III.   Conclusion\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f",

It goes without saying that Santa Rosa was present when his performances were recorded by Combo Records, and thus knew from the moment that each recording was created that he had a potential claim for ownership of it.

Even applying this test for accrual of a claim, we cannot think of a more plain and express repudiation of co-ownership than the fact that Combo openly, and quite notoriously, sold Santa Rosa's records without providing payment to him: according to documents provided by Santa Rosa, at least 1,140 of the recordings in dispute were sold during the six month period between January and June of 2000, almost four years before Santa Rosa filed suit in May 2004.

A co-author knows that he or she jointly created a work from the moment of its creation.\"). It goes without saying that Santa Rosa was present when his performances were recorded by Combo Records, and thus knew from the moment that each recording was created that he had a potential claim for ownership of it. Thus, there is little question that Santa Rosa's claims for co-ownership accrued as soon as he finished recording each album.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santa Rosa points to the Ninth Circuit's holding in <i>Zuill v.

Even applying this test for accrual of a claim, we cannot think of a more plain and express repudiation of co-ownership than the fact that Combo openly, and quite notoriously, sold Santa Rosa's records without providing payment to him: according to documents provided by Santa Rosa, at least 1,140 of the recordings in dispute were sold during the six month period between January and June of 2000, almost four years before Santa Rosa filed suit in May 2004. Likewise, it is hard to believe that a singer of Santa Rosa's stature would have been unaware that Combo Records was selling his recordings and thus claiming ownership over them until three years before this action was commenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we conclude that Santa Rosa had reason to know of his claim of ownership over the recordings soon after they were created (which was well over three years before Santa Rosa filed suit against Combo), we agree with the district court that Santa Rosa's declaratory judgment action is time barred by 17 U.S.C. &#167; 507(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>See, e.g.,</i> Robert Dom&#237;nguez, Maite Junco and Leo Standora, <i>Shakira Crowned New Latin Queen,</i> N.Y.
