Petitioner Jaezef Adward\n\nDiab (\"Petitioner\") seeks review of the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals' (\"BIA\") decision to affirm the Immigration Judge's (\"IJ\")\n\ndenial of his petition for relief from removal, withholding of\n\nremoval,    and    protection    under   the    Convention    Against    Torture\n\n(\"CAT\").1         Finding   Petitioner    has    neither     established     past\n\npersecution based on a protected category, nor a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution, we affirm.\n\n                                 I.   BACKGROUND\n\n            Petitioner      is   an   Egyptian     national    and   a     Coptic\n\nChristian. Coptic Christians are a religious minority in Egypt and\n\nhistorically have been the victims of discrimination by local\n\nEgyptian officials as well as Muslim extremists.                 The Egyptian\n\nnational government, however, has taken affirmative steps to limit\n\nsuch religious discrimination over the past few years.\n\n            Petitioner resided in Egypt until 1988, at which time he\n\nmoved to Greece ostensibly to escape religious persecution.                    He\n\narrived in the United States on January 12, 1997, and filed a\n\npetition for asylum on March 28, 1998.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment is codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231.\nWhile Petitioner appeals the BIA’s ruling concerning his CAT claim,\nhe makes no mention of this claim except within his statement of\nissues, and therefore we will not consider it upon appeal. See\nStrahan v. Coxe, 127 F.3d 155, 172 (1st Cir. 1997) (refusing to\naddress claim mentioned only in statement of issues).\n\n                                       -2-\n\f          In support of his application for asylum, Petitioner\n\ntestified before an Asylum Officer (\"AO\") that, while he resided in\n\nEgypt, he was often confronted by Muslims who asked (and attempted\n\nto bribe) him to convert to Islam.     Petitioner claimed that, in\n\n1973 and 1975, while he was attending school, he was physically\n\nattacked on account of his religion by men that he believed to be\n\nMuslim.   Petitioner further testified that, while in the army in\n\n1982, a group of soldiers beat him when he refused to convert to\n\nIslam.\n\n          Petitioner further testified that one year after moving\n\nto Greece, a Muslim extremist named Hussein stabbed him thirty-\n\nthree times in his home.    Petitioner claimed that he spent two\n\nweeks in a Greek hospital as a result of his injuries and that\n\nHussein was sentenced to ten years in prison for his crime.   In his\n\napplication, Petitioner noted that Hussein’s sentence was nearly\n\ncomplete, and that Petitioner had fled to the United States because\n\nhe feared that either Hussein or one of his associates would\n\nattempt to harm him upon Hussein's release.\n\n          Petitioner also testified that he returned to Egypt in\n\n1993 for twenty-three days to renew his passport, which was cheaper\n\nto renew in Egypt, and returned again in 1995, staying for twenty-\n\nfive days in order to renew his visa for his stay in Greece.     In\n\nDecember of 1996, Petitioner returned yet again, this time for a\n\nten day visit with his mother.\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f              The   AO   determined   that   Petitioner   was   not   credible\n\nbecause his testimony was internally inconsistent, inconsistent\n\nwith his written application, and vague.               Specifically, the AO\n\nfound that Petitioner's testimony of the incidents in Egypt did not\n\ncontain the substantive detail that a credible witness would be\n\nable to provide, and that Petitioner did not mention any of the\n\nspecific assaults in Egypt in his application--he only described\n\nthe attack in Greece.         The AO was also concerned that material\n\naspects of the account of the attack in Greece contained in\n\nPetitioner's application were missing from his testimony. The AO’s\n\nreport, which recommended that Petitioner’s application for asylum\n\nbe denied, was sent to the IJ for use at the removal proceedings.\n\n              During the removal proceedings, Petitioner submitted\n\nvarious news articles and country condition reports detailing the\n\nabuse    of    Coptic    Christians    by    Muslim   extremists   in   Egypt.\n\nPetitioner also submitted an article, in Greek, that purportedly\n\ndescribes the knife attack.2          When Petitioner testified before the\n\nIJ, he again asserted that he was afraid to return to Egypt because\n\nof Islamic fundamentalists generally, as well as of Hussein and his\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The article’s apparent translation, written in pen on\nnotebook paper and not in complete sentences, does not name\nPetitioner; it refers to the victim of the attack as \"County Joseph\nDi from Cairo.\" The translation also asserts that the victim was\nstabbed nineteen times, not thirty-three.     Respondent questions\nboth the authenticity of the translation and whether the article\nactually refers to Petitioner or his story.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fassociates in particular.3      The IJ, like the AO, found Petitioner\n\nnot credible.    Primarily, the IJ doubted Petitioner’s expressed\n\nfear of returning to Egypt, given that he had returned in 1993,\n\n1995, and 1996 for extended periods of time.        In addition, the IJ\n\nfound that Petitioner had not provided sufficient corroborating\n\nevidence.    Petitioner submitted no hospital records or evidence\n\ncorroborative   of   the   specific   allegations   he   made   about   his\n\npersecution in Egypt or the attack in Greece.             The IJ denied\n\nPetitioner relief from removal under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(42)(A) and\n\n1158(a), withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and\n\nprotection under CAT.      The BIA issued an order summarily affirming\n\nthe IJ’s decision, and Petitioner filed this timely petition for\n\njudicial review.\n\n                             II.   DISCUSSION\n\n            While this case involves judicial review of a decision by\n\nthe BIA, when the BIA summarily affirms an IJ’s opinion, we review\n\nthe IJ’s analysis.    See El Moraghy v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 195, 203\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).      The BIA’s determination must be upheld if\n\n\"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole,\" INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S.\n\n478, 481 (1992), and will be overturned, \"only when the record\n\nevidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary\n\n\n     3\n      Petitioner claims, but provides no evidence, that his\nattacker was a member of the Muslim fundamentalist group, Gamat Al\nIslamiyah.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fdetermination.\"       Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (citing Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 481 & n.1).\n\n              In order to qualify for asylum, an applicant bears the\n\nburden of establishing that he is a \"refugee\" as defined by 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).             8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1); Mukamusoni v.\n\nAshcroft, 390 F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir. 2004).            An applicant can meet\n\nthis burden in one of two ways: (1) by demonstrating a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion, or\n\n(2)    by   proving     past   persecution    on   account    of   one     of    the\n\naforementioned        grounds,    which    entitles    an     applicant     to     a\n\npresumption of a well-founded fear of persecution.                    8 U.S.C. §\n\n1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b); see Yatskin v. INS, 255 F.3d\n\n5, 9 (1st Cir. 2001).          Proving past persecution, in the words of\n\nthis Circuit, is \"a daunting task,\" Guzman v. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 15\n\n(1st   Cir.    2003),    and   the    identified    conduct    must   go   beyond\n\n\"unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering,\"                Nelson v.\n\nINS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).            Without the benefit of the\n\npresumption, an applicant must satisfy both a subjective and an\n\nobjective test in order to prove a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.     Velasquez v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 55, 58-59 (1st Cir.\n\n2003); El Moraghy, 331 F.3d at 203.           \"The subjective test requires\n\nthe applicant to prove his fear is genuine, while the objective\n\ntest requires a showing by credible and specific evidence that this\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\ffear is reasonable.\"        Mukamusoni, 390 F.3d at 120.             An applicant’s\n\ntestimony alone, \"if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the\n\nburden of proof without corroboration.\"                8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a); El\n\nMoraghy, 331 F.3d at 203.               Should the applicant be found not\n\nentirely    credible,       corroborating         evidence,      such    as   country\n\ncondition    reports,       may    be    used     to   bolster     an    applicant’s\n\ncredibility. See El Moraghy, 331 F.3d at 204; see also Mukamusoni,\n\n390 F.3d at 124.     Here, Petitioner asserts that he should have been\n\nfound    credible,    and     additionally,         that    he     produced      enough\n\ncorroborating    evidence         to    support     his    claim    of    both    past\n\npersecution and well-founded fear of future persecution.                            We\n\ndisagree.\n\nA.          Past Persecution\n\n            To   establish         past     persecution,         Petitioner       must\n\ndemonstrate either through credible testimony, or a combination of\n\ntestimony and corroborative evidence, that he was persecuted on the\n\nbasis of his religion.            See 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.13(a)and (b)(1); El\n\nMoraghy, 331 F.3d at 203-04.            We begin by noting that the IJ found\n\nPetitioner's testimony not credible, and that the IJ was reasonable\n\nin this determination.4\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      In addition to concurring with the AO’s determination that\nPetitioner’s testimony was internally inconsistent and vague, the\nIJ determined that Petitioner could not sufficiently justify his\ntrips back to Egypt, discussed infra p. 12-13.\n\n                                          -7-\n\f             In addition, the IJ reasonably found that the evidence\n\nPetitioner provided did not adequately bolster his credibility.\n\nSee Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 572.             For example, to corroborate\n\nhis account of the attack in Greece, Petitioner submitted an\n\narticle      in   Greek,    without     providing       an   adequate          English\n\ntranslation.      And, the rough translation he did provide does not\n\nidentify Petitioner as the victim, nor does it say that the attack\n\nwas   religiously       motivated.      As    further    evidence,           Petitioner\n\nsubmitted a letter from a doctor in the United States dated June\n\n24,   1998    (nine     years   after   the   attack)    that     mentions        scars\n\nconsistent with an attack similar to the one Petitioner described.\n\nPetitioner did not, however, submit any contemporaneous medical\n\nrecords from his attack or from his alleged two-week hospital stay.\n\nAnd, even assuming the letter from the doctor is sufficient to\n\ncorroborate Petitioner’s claim that he was attacked as described,\n\nit does not establish that he was attacked on the basis of his\n\nreligion.         Cf.    Aguilar-Solis,       168    F.3d    at        572    (Without\n\ncorroborating     evidence      to   prove    that   attacks      on    petitioner’s\n\nvillage were politically motivated, the court was not compelled to\n\nfind for petitioner.). Furthermore, Petitioner did not provide any\n\npolice records from Hussein's arrest, nor any court records from\n\nHussein's alleged criminal conviction.5                 Thus, looking at the\n\n\n      5\n      It is significant that Petitioner's attack occurred in\nGreece. Unlike some of the cases we review where documentation is\ndifficult to obtain, such as in the genocide-ravaged country of\n\n                                        -8-\n\frecord   as    a   whole,   the   IJ    did     not   err   in   determining   that\n\nPetitioner has not proven past persecution and therefore is not\n\nentitled      to   a   presumption     of   a   well-founded      fear   of   future\n\npersecution.       See 8 C.F.R. §208.13; Nelson, 232 F.3d at 264.\n\nB.            Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution\n\n              We now turn to whether Petitioner has proven a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution. As mentioned above, this\n\nrequirement has both an objective and subjective component.                      See\n\nMukamusoni, 390 F.3d at 120.\n\n1.            Objective Fear\n\n              Beginning with the objective component, Petitioner must\n\nprove that \"a reasonable person . . . would fear persecution on\n\naccount of\" his religion.              Nelson, 232 F.3d at 264 (quoting\n\nAguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 572). Petitioner must provide \"credible\n\nand specific evidence that this fear is reasonable.\" Mukamusoni,\n\n390 F.3d at 120 (citing El Moraghy, 331 F.3d at 203).\n\n              Although the IJ found Petitioner generally not credible,\n\nPetitioner provided supporting evidence in the form of multiple\n\nnews articles concerning the treatment of Coptic Christians in\n\nEgypt, as well as a 1997 terrorist attack by Muslim fundamentalists\n\n\n\n\nRwanda, Greece is a modern country, and therefore Petitioner\nreasonably may be expected to provide such documentation, or at a\nminimum, an explanation for the absence of such documentation.\n\n                                        -9-\n\fin Egypt.6    Petitioner also supplied country condition reports on\n\nEgypt for the years 1995, 1996, 2000, and 2001.              The 2000 and 2001\n\nreports    state     that      Muslim   extremists     continue    to   persecute\n\nreligious minorities, specifically Coptic Christians, despite the\n\nnational government’s efforts to ensure free exercise of religion.\n\nThe 2000 report also identifies four assaults by Muslim extremists\n\non Coptic Christians, and notes that a trial had commenced that\n\nyear for the premeditated murder of a Coptic priest by a Muslim\n\nextremist.        The 1996 report explicitly states that \"[t]errorist\n\nviolence against Christians was a problem,\" and that \"[t]errorist\n\ngroups seeking to overthrow the Government and establish an Islamic\n\nstate continued their attacks on police, Coptic Christians, and\n\ntourists.\"        MB, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, Egypt\n\n(1997) (emphasis added).\n\n             Despite what appears to be helpful background evidence,\n\nthe IJ devotes one sentence in his opinion summarizing these\n\nreports,     as    well   as    the   various   news   articles    submitted   by\n\nPetitioner,       concluding     that   they    only   “indicate    that   Moslem\n\nfundamentalists are seeking to overthrow the government of Egypt\n\nand establish a[n] Islamic fundamentalist government in Egypt.\"\n\nThe IJ also found it significant that none of the articles or\n\n\n\n     6\n      In November of 1997, a group of Muslim extremists opened fire\non Egyptians and tourists at the temple of Hachepsut in Luxor,\nEgypt. Sixty people were killed, and twenty were wounded. The\nattack was believed to be aimed at disrupting the tourist industry.\n\n                                        -10-\n\fcountry condition reports refer to Petitioner or any of his family\n\nby name.   But, the correct use of country condition reports is to\n\nprovide \"a general description of conditions faced by Coptic\n\nChristians in Egypt.\"      El Moraghy, 331 F.3d at 204 (emphasis\n\nadded).    Country condition reports need not refer to a petitioner\n\nby name to be probative.    See id.     (\"It is unrealistic to expect\n\nthat country condition reports could contain references to all\n\ncitizens of that country who have faced . . . persecution\" and \"to\n\ndemand that they do so . . . is clearly erroneous.\").\n\n           Here, there is simply an \"absence of reasoned discussion\"\n\nby the IJ of whether the country condition reports and articles\n\nsufficiently support Petitioner's claim that a \"reasonable person\"\n\nin Petitioner's shoes as a Coptic Christian living Egypt would fear\n\nreturning to Egypt.   See id.   Therefore, we cannot determine if the\n\nIJ properly considered this evidence.      But because, as we discuss\n\nbelow, Petitioner has failed to establish a subjective fear of\n\npersecution, we need not consider whether the IJ's cursory review\n\nof this documentary evidence was in error.7          Cf. id. at 205\n\n(remanding in light of misuse of country condition reports and the\n\nabsence of key findings in IJ's discussion of both past persecution\n\nand fear of future persecution).\n\n\n     7\n      We urge that in the future, an IJ should be more\ncomprehensive in discussing his analysis of potentially relevant\ndocumentary evidence so that a reviewing court can evaluate whether\nsuch evidence was properly considered. See El Moraghy, 331 F.3d at\n204-05.\n\n                                 -11-\n\f2.           Subjective Fear\n\n             To prove a well-founded fear of future persecution,\n\nPetitioner also must demonstrate a subjective fear of persecution.\n\nVelasquez, 316 F.3d at 58-59.         Under this prong, Petitioner must\n\nprove that his fear is genuine.           See Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at\n\n572.     A crucial aspect in determining whether an applicant has a\n\ngenuine fear is the applicant’s credibility.            See Mukamusoni, 390\n\nF.3d at 125 (The BIA cannot, as a matter of law, question the\n\n“genuineness”        of    petitioner’s      fear      without     addressing\n\ncredibility.).\n\n             We begin, yet again, with the fact that the IJ reasonably\n\nfound    Petitioner’s     testimony    not   credible.       The     IJ    noted\n\nPetitioner's inability to explain why he returned to Egypt on three\n\noccasions despite his apparent fear of \"imminent death\" if he were\n\nto return there now.      While returning to one’s native country does\n\nnot automatically refute the possibility of having a genuine fear,\n\nsee, e.g., Mukamusoni, 319 F.3d at 126 (The petitioner’s return to\n\nRwanda to finish her education, when faced with \"no viable means of\n\nsupport otherwise,\" did not undercut her claim as \"people take\n\nrisks in the face of their fears.\"), Petitioner's three trips to\n\nEgypt,     all    occurring   after    the   alleged     incidents    of     his\n\npersecution, significantly undercut his claim that he is now afraid\n\nto return.       Petitioner’s first return in 1993 was for twenty-three\n\ndays, allegedly to renew his passport, which he could have done\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f(albeit more expensively) outside of Egypt.   His second return in\n\n1995, for twenty-five days, was to renew his visa to stay in\n\nGreece.   His third, a trip for ten days in 1996, was to visit his\n\nmother.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner is an Egyptian national and a Coptic Christian. Coptic Christians are a religious minority in Egypt and historically have been the victims of discrimination by local Egyptian officials as well as Muslim extremists. The Egyptian national government, however, has taken affirmative steps to limit such religious discrimination over the past few years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner resided in Egypt until 1988, at which time he moved to Greece ostensibly to escape religious persecution. He arrived in the United States on January 12, 1997, and filed a petition for asylum on March 28, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his application for asylum, Petitioner testified before an Asylum Officer (\"AO\") that, while he resided in Egypt, he was often confronted by Muslims who asked (and attempted to bribe) him to convert to Islam. Petitioner claimed that, in 1973 and 1975, while he was attending school, he was physically attacked on account of his religion by men that he believed to be Muslim. Petitioner further testified that, while in the army in 1982, a group of soldiers beat him when he refused to convert to Islam.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner further testified that one year after moving to Greece, a Muslim extremist named Hussein stabbed him thirty-three times in his home. Petitioner claimed that he spent two weeks in a Greek hospital as a result of his injuries and that Hussein was sentenced to ten years in prison for his crime. In his application, Petitioner noted that Hussein's sentence was nearly complete, and that Petitioner had fled to the United States because he feared that either Hussein or one of his associates would attempt to harm him upon Hussein's release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner also testified that he returned to Egypt in 1993 for twenty-three days to renew his passport, which was cheaper to renew in Egypt, and returned again in 1995, staying for twenty-five days in order to renew his visa for his stay in Greece. In December of 1996, Petitioner returned yet again, this time for a ten day visit with his mother.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The AO determined that Petitioner was not credible because his testimony was internally inconsistent, inconsistent with his written application, and vague. Specifically, the AO found that Petitioner's testimony of the incidents in Egypt did not contain the substantive detail that a credible witness would be able to provide, and that Petitioner did not mention any of the specific assaults in Egypt in his application &#8212; he only described the attack in Greece. The AO was also concerned that material aspects of the account of the attack in Greece contained in Petitioner's application were missing from his testimony. The AO's report, which recommended that Petitioner's application for asylum be denied, was sent to the IJ for use at the removal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the removal proceedings, Petitioner submitted various news articles and country condition reports detailing the abuse of Coptic Christians by Muslim extremists in Egypt. Petitioner also submitted an article, in Greek, that purportedly describes the knife attack.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> When Petitioner testified before the IJ, he again asserted that he was afraid to return to Egypt because of Islamic fundamentalists generally, as well as of Hussein and his associates in particular.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The IJ, like the AO, found Petitioner not credible. Primarily, the IJ doubted Petitioner's expressed fear of returning to Egypt, given that he had returned in 1993, 1995, and 1996 for extended periods of time. In addition, the IJ found that Petitioner had not provided sufficient corroborating evidence. Petitioner submitted no hospital records or evidence corroborative of the specific allegations he made about his persecution in Egypt or the attack in Greece. The IJ denied Petitioner relief from removal under 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1101(a)(42)(A) and 1158(a), withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(b)(3), and protection under CAT. The BIA issued an order summarily affirming the IJ's decision, and Petitioner filed this timely petition for judicial review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this case involves judicial review of a decision by the BIA, when the BIA summarily affirms an IJ's opinion, we review the IJ's analysis. <i>See El Moraghy v. Ashcroft,</i> 331 F.3d 195, 203 (1st Cir.2003). The BIA's determination must be upheld if \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,\" <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and will be overturned, \"only when the record evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination.\" <i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir.1999) (citing <i>Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. at 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to qualify for asylum, an applicant bears the burden of establishing that he is a \"refugee\" as defined by 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A). 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(1); <i>Mukamusoni v. Ashcroft,</i> 390 F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir.2004). An applicant can meet this burden in one of two ways: (1) by demonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, or (2) by proving past persecution on account of one of the aforementioned grounds, which entitles an applicant to a presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b); <i>see Yatskin v. INS,</i> 255 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir.2001). Proving past persecution, in the words of this Circuit, is \"a daunting task,\" <i>Guzman v. INS,</i> 327 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir.2003), and the identified conduct must go beyond \"unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering,\" <i>Nelson v. INS,</i> 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir.2000). Without the benefit of the presumption, an applicant must satisfy both a subjective and an objective test in order to prove a well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>Velasquez v. Ashcroft,</i> 342 F.3d 55, 58-59 (1st Cir.2003); <i>El Moraghy,</i> 331 F.3d at 203. \"The subjective test requires the applicant to prove his fear is genuine, while the objective test requires a showing by credible and specific evidence that this fear is reasonable.\" <i>Mukamusoni,</i> 390 F.3d at 120. An applicant's testimony alone, \"if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(a); <i>El Moraghy,</i> 331 F.3d at 203. Should the applicant be found not entirely credible, corroborating evidence, such as country condition reports, may be used to bolster an applicant's credibility. <i>See El Moraghy,</i> 331 F.3d at 204; <i>see also Mukamusoni,</i> 390 F.3d at 124. Here, Petitioner asserts that he should have been found credible, and additionally, that he produced enough corroborating evidence to support his claim of both past persecution and well-founded fear of future persecution. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Past Persecution</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish past persecution, Petitioner must demonstrate either through credible testimony, or a combination of testimony and corroborative evidence, that he was persecuted on the basis of his religion. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 208.13(a)and (b)(1); <i>El Moraghy,</i> 331 F.3d at 203-04. We begin by noting that the IJ found Petitioner's testimony not credible, and that the IJ was reasonable in this determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the IJ reasonably found that the evidence Petitioner provided did not adequately bolster his credibility. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572. For example, to corroborate his account of the attack in Greece, Petitioner submitted an article in Greek, without providing an adequate English translation. And, the rough translation he did provide does not identify Petitioner as the victim, nor does it say that the attack was religiously motivated. As further evidence, Petitioner submitted a letter from a doctor in the United States dated June 24, 1998 (nine years after the attack) that mentions scars consistent with an attack similar to the one Petitioner described. Petitioner did not, however, submit any contemporaneous medical records from his attack or from his alleged two-week hospital stay. And, even assuming the letter from the doctor is sufficient to corroborate Petitioner's claim that he was attacked as described, it does not establish that he was attacked on the basis of his religion. <i>Cf. Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572 (Without corroborating evidence to prove that attacks on petitioner's village were politically motivated, the court was not compelled to find for petitioner.). Furthermore, Petitioner did not provide any police records from Hussein's arrest, nor any court records from Hussein's alleged criminal conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Thus, looking at the record as a whole, the IJ did not err in determining that Petitioner has not proven past persecution and therefore is not entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13; <i>Nelson,</i> 232 F.3d at 264.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to whether Petitioner has proven a well-founded fear of future persecution. As mentioned above, this requirement has both an objective and subjective component. <i>See Mukamusoni,</i> 390 F.3d at 120.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Objective Fear</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning with the objective component, Petitioner must prove that \"a reasonable person ... would fear persecution on account of\" his religion. <i>Nelson,</i> 232 F.3d at 264 (quoting <i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572). Petitioner must provide \"credible and specific evidence that this fear is reasonable.\" <i>Mukamusoni,</i> 390 F.3d at 120 (citing <i>El Moraghy,</i> 331 F.3d at 203).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the IJ found Petitioner generally not credible, Petitioner provided supporting evidence in the form of multiple news articles concerning the treatment of Coptic Christians in Egypt, as well as a 1997 terrorist attack by Muslim fundamentalists in Egypt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Petitioner also supplied country condition reports on Egypt for the years 1995, 1996, 2000, and 2001. The 2000 and 2001 reports state that Muslim extremists continue to persecute religious minorities, specifically Coptic Christians, despite the national government's efforts to ensure free exercise of religion. The 2000 report also identifies four assaults by Muslim extremists on Coptic Christians, and notes that a trial had commenced that year for the premeditated murder of a Coptic priest by a Muslim extremist. The 1996 report explicitly states that \"[t]errorist violence against Christians was a problem,\" and that \"[t]errorist groups seeking to overthrow the Government and establish an Islamic state continued their attacks on police, <i>Coptic Christians,</i> and tourists.\" MB, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, Egypt (1997) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite what appears to be helpful background evidence, the IJ devotes one sentence in his opinion summarizing these reports, as well as the various news articles submitted by Petitioner, concluding that they only \"indicate that Moslem fundamentalists are seeking to overthrow the government of Egypt and establish a[n] Islamic fundamentalist government in Egypt.\" The IJ also found it significant that none of the articles or country condition reports refer to Petitioner or any of his family by name. But, the correct use of country condition reports is to provide \"a <i>general</i> description of conditions faced by Coptic Christians in Egypt.\" <i>El Moraghy,</i> 331 F.3d at 204 (emphasis added). Country condition reports need not refer to a petitioner by name to be probative. <i>See id.</i> (\"It is unrealistic to expect that country condition reports could contain references to all citizens of that country who have faced ... persecution\" and \"to demand that they do so ... is clearly erroneous.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there is simply an \"absence of reasoned discussion\" by the IJ of whether the country condition reports and articles sufficiently support Petitioner's claim that a \"reasonable person\" in Petitioner's shoes as a Coptic Christian living Egypt would fear returning to Egypt. <i>See id.</i> Therefore, we cannot determine if the IJ properly considered this evidence. But because, as we discuss below, Petitioner has failed to establish a subjective fear of persecution, we need not consider whether the IJ's cursory review of this documentary evidence was in error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>Cf. id.</i> at 205 (remanding in light of misuse of country condition reports and the absence of key findings in IJ's discussion of both past persecution and fear of future persecution).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Subjective Fear</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove a well-founded fear of future persecution, Petitioner also must demonstrate a subjective fear of persecution. <i>Velasquez,</i> 342 F.3d at 58-59. Under this prong, Petitioner must prove that his fear is genuine. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572. A crucial aspect in determining whether an applicant has a genuine fear is the applicant's credibility. <i>See Mukamusoni,</i> 390 F.3d at 125 (The BIA cannot, as a matter of law, question the \"genuineness\" of petitioner's fear without addressing credibility.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin, yet again, with the fact that the IJ reasonably found Petitioner's testimony not credible. The IJ noted Petitioner's inability to explain why he returned to Egypt on three occasions despite his apparent fear of \"imminent death\" if he were to return there now. While returning to one's native country does not automatically refute the possibility of having a genuine fear, <i>see, e.g., Mukamusoni,</i> 390 F.3d at 126 (The petitioner's return to Rwanda to finish her education, when faced with \"no viable means of support otherwise,\" did not undercut her claim as \"people take risks in the face of their fears.\"), Petitioner's three trips to Egypt, all occurring after the alleged incidents of his persecution, significantly undercut his claim that he is now afraid to return. Petitioner's first return in 1993 was for twenty-three days, allegedly to renew his passport, which he could have done (albeit more expensively) outside of Egypt. His second return in 1995, for twenty-five days, was to renew his visa to stay in Greece. His third, a trip for ten days in 1996, was to visit his mother. In his defense, Petitioner claims that he was only able to return to Egypt on these occasions because he went back in secret and stayed at a different address from his family. The reasons for these returns, however, and the length of the stays, support the IJ's determination that Petitioner does not have a subjective fear of returning to Egypt. As such, any error that the IJ may have made in failing to provide a reasoned analysis of the country condition reports and articles is harmless, and the BIA's decision is affirmed. <i>See, e.g., Mekhoukh v. Ashcroft,</i> 358 F.3d 118, 130 (1st Cir.2004) (applying harmless error standard).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for judicial review is DENIED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment is codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231.

Petitioner further testified that, while in the army in 1982, a group of soldiers beat him when he refused to convert to Islam.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner further testified that one year after moving to Greece, a Muslim extremist named Hussein stabbed him thirty-three times in his home. Petitioner claimed that he spent two weeks in a Greek hospital as a result of his injuries and that Hussein was sentenced to ten years in prison for his crime. In his application, Petitioner noted that Hussein's sentence was nearly complete, and that Petitioner had fled to the United States because he feared that either Hussein or one of his associates would attempt to harm him upon Hussein's release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner also testified that he returned to Egypt in 1993 for twenty-three days to renew his passport, which was cheaper to renew in Egypt, and returned again in 1995, staying for twenty-five days in order to renew his visa for his stay in Greece. In December of 1996, Petitioner returned yet again, this time for a ten day visit with his mother.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The AO determined that Petitioner was not credible because his testimony was internally inconsistent, inconsistent with his written application, and vague. Specifically, the AO found that Petitioner's testimony of the incidents in Egypt did not contain the substantive detail that a credible witness would be able to provide, and that Petitioner did not mention any of the specific assaults in Egypt in his application &#8212; he only described the attack in Greece. The AO was also concerned that material aspects of the account of the attack in Greece contained in Petitioner's application were missing from his testimony. The AO's report, which recommended that Petitioner's application for asylum be denied, was sent to the IJ for use at the removal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the removal proceedings, Petitioner submitted various news articles and country condition reports detailing the abuse of Coptic Christians by Muslim extremists in Egypt. Petitioner also submitted an article, in Greek, that purportedly describes the knife attack.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> When Petitioner testified before the IJ, he again asserted that he was afraid to return to Egypt because of Islamic fundamentalists generally, as well as of Hussein and his associates in particular.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The IJ, like the AO, found Petitioner not credible. Primarily, the IJ doubted Petitioner's expressed fear of returning to Egypt, given that he had returned in 1993, 1995, and 1996 for extended periods of time. In addition, the IJ found that Petitioner had not provided sufficient corroborating evidence. Petitioner submitted no hospital records or evidence corroborative of the specific allegations he made about his persecution in Egypt or the attack in Greece. The IJ denied Petitioner relief from removal under 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1101(a)(42)(A) and 1158(a), withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(b)(3), and protection under CAT. The BIA issued an order summarily affirming the IJ's decision, and Petitioner filed this timely petition for judicial review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

An applicant can meet this burden in one of two ways: (1) by demonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, or (2) by proving past persecution on account of one of the aforementioned grounds, which entitles an applicant to a presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b); <i>see Yatskin v.

Without the benefit of the presumption, an applicant must satisfy both a subjective and an objective test in order to prove a well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>Velasquez v.

An applicant's testimony alone, \"if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(a); <i>El Moraghy,</i> 331 F.3d at 203. Should the applicant be found not entirely credible, corroborating evidence, such as country condition reports, may be used to bolster an applicant's credibility. <i>See El Moraghy,</i> 331 F.3d at 204; <i>see also Mukamusoni,</i> 390 F.3d at 124. Here, Petitioner asserts that he should have been found credible, and additionally, that he produced enough corroborating evidence to support his claim of both past persecution and well-founded fear of future persecution. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Past Persecution</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish past persecution, Petitioner must demonstrate either through credible testimony, or a combination of testimony and corroborative evidence, that he was persecuted on the basis of his religion. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 208.13(a)and (b)(1); <i>El Moraghy,</i> 331 F.3d at 203-04. We begin by noting that the IJ found Petitioner's testimony not credible, and that the IJ was reasonable in this determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the IJ reasonably found that the evidence Petitioner provided did not adequately bolster his credibility. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572. For example, to corroborate his account of the attack in Greece, Petitioner submitted an article in Greek, without providing an adequate English translation. And, the rough translation he did provide does not identify Petitioner as the victim, nor does it say that the attack was religiously motivated. As further evidence, Petitioner submitted a letter from a doctor in the United States dated June 24, 1998 (nine years after the attack) that mentions scars consistent with an attack similar to the one Petitioner described. Petitioner did not, however, submit any contemporaneous medical records from his attack or from his alleged two-week hospital stay. And, even assuming the letter from the doctor is sufficient to corroborate Petitioner's claim that he was attacked as described, it does not establish that he was attacked on the basis of his religion. <i>Cf. Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572 (Without corroborating evidence to prove that attacks on petitioner's village were politically motivated, the court was not compelled to find for petitioner.). Furthermore, Petitioner did not provide any police records from Hussein's arrest, nor any court records from Hussein's alleged criminal conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Thus, looking at the record as a whole, the IJ did not err in determining that Petitioner has not proven past persecution and therefore is not entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13; <i>Nelson,</i> 232 F.3d at 264.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to whether Petitioner has proven a well-founded fear of future persecution. As mentioned above, this requirement has both an objective and subjective component. <i>See Mukamusoni,</i> 390 F.3d at 120.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Objective Fear</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning with the objective component, Petitioner must prove that \"a reasonable person ... would fear persecution on account of\" his religion. <i>Nelson,</i> 232 F.3d at 264 (quoting <i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572). Petitioner must provide \"credible and specific evidence that this fear is reasonable.\" <i>Mukamusoni,</i> 390 F.3d at 120 (citing <i>El Moraghy,</i> 331 F.3d at 203).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the IJ found Petitioner generally not credible, Petitioner provided supporting evidence in the form of multiple news articles concerning the treatment of Coptic Christians in Egypt, as well as a 1997 terrorist attack by Muslim fundamentalists in Egypt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Petitioner also supplied country condition reports on Egypt for the years 1995, 1996, 2000, and 2001. The 2000 and 2001 reports state that Muslim extremists continue to persecute religious minorities, specifically Coptic Christians, despite the national government's efforts to ensure free exercise of religion. The 2000 report also identifies four assaults by Muslim extremists on Coptic Christians, and notes that a trial had commenced that year for the premeditated murder of a Coptic priest by a Muslim extremist. The 1996 report explicitly states that \"[t]errorist violence against Christians was a problem,\" and that \"[t]errorist groups seeking to overthrow the Government and establish an Islamic state continued their attacks on police, <i>Coptic Christians,</i> and tourists.\" MB, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, Egypt (1997) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite what appears to be helpful background evidence, the IJ devotes one sentence in his opinion summarizing these reports, as well as the various news articles submitted by Petitioner, concluding that they only \"indicate that Moslem fundamentalists are seeking to overthrow the government of Egypt and establish a[n] Islamic fundamentalist government in Egypt.\" The IJ also found it significant that none of the articles or country condition reports refer to Petitioner or any of his family by name. But, the correct use of country condition reports is to provide \"a <i>general</i> description of conditions faced by Coptic Christians in Egypt.\" <i>El Moraghy,</i> 331 F.3d at 204 (emphasis added). Country condition reports need not refer to a petitioner by name to be probative. <i>See id.</i> (\"It is unrealistic to expect that country condition reports could contain references to all citizens of that country who have faced ... persecution\" and \"to demand that they do so ... is clearly erroneous.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there is simply an \"absence of reasoned discussion\" by the IJ of whether the country condition reports and articles sufficiently support Petitioner's claim that a \"reasonable person\" in Petitioner's shoes as a Coptic Christian living Egypt would fear returning to Egypt. <i>See id.</i> Therefore, we cannot determine if the IJ properly considered this evidence. But because, as we discuss below, Petitioner has failed to establish a subjective fear of persecution, we need not consider whether the IJ's cursory review of this documentary evidence was in error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>Cf. id.</i> at 205 (remanding in light of misuse of country condition reports and the absence of key findings in IJ's discussion of both past persecution and fear of future persecution).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Subjective Fear</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove a well-founded fear of future persecution, Petitioner also must demonstrate a subjective fear of persecution. <i>Velasquez,</i> 342 F.3d at 58-59. Under this prong, Petitioner must prove that his fear is genuine. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572. A crucial aspect in determining whether an applicant has a genuine fear is the applicant's credibility. <i>See Mukamusoni,</i> 390 F.3d at 125 (The BIA cannot, as a matter of law, question the \"genuineness\" of petitioner's fear without addressing credibility.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin, yet again, with the fact that the IJ reasonably found Petitioner's testimony not credible. The IJ noted Petitioner's inability to explain why he returned to Egypt on three occasions despite his apparent fear of \"imminent death\" if he were to return there now. While returning to one's native country does not automatically refute the possibility of having a genuine fear, <i>see, e.g., Mukamusoni,</i> 390 F.3d at 126 (The petitioner's return to Rwanda to finish her education, when faced with \"no viable means of support otherwise,\" did not undercut her claim as \"people take risks in the face of their fears.\"), Petitioner's three trips to Egypt, all occurring after the alleged incidents of his persecution, significantly undercut his claim that he is now afraid to return. Petitioner's first return in 1993 was for twenty-three days, allegedly to renew his passport, which he could have done (albeit more expensively) outside of Egypt. His second return in 1995, for twenty-five days, was to renew his visa to stay in Greece. His third, a trip for ten days in 1996, was to visit his mother. In his defense, Petitioner claims that he was only able to return to Egypt on these occasions because he went back in secret and stayed at a different address from his family. The reasons for these returns, however, and the length of the stays, support the IJ's determination that Petitioner does not have a subjective fear of returning to Egypt. As such, any error that the IJ may have made in failing to provide a reasoned analysis of the country condition reports and articles is harmless, and the BIA's decision is affirmed. <i>See, e.g., Mekhoukh v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200854\"><a href=\"/opinion/200854/mekhoukh-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span>, 130 (1st Cir.2004) (applying harmless error standard).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for judicial review is DENIED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment is codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231.
