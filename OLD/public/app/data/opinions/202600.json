George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n                   Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Rosemary Curran Scapicchio for petitioner.\n     Annette C. Benedetto, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal\nBureau, with whom Thomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, was on\nbrief, for respondent.\n\n\n\n                        January 19, 2007\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge.       This appeal raises questions\n\nconcerning a \"mixed\" habeas corpus petition (a petition where not\n\nall of the claims have been exhausted before the state court) filed\n\nby Massachusetts prisoner David Josselyn.            In particular, we\n\nconsider   whether   Josselyn's   petition   does,   in   fact,   include\n\nunexhausted claims and, if so, whether the district court should\n\nhave stayed the federal action while Josselyn exhausted these\n\nclaims.\n\n           Josselyn was convicted in Massachusetts state court of\n\narmed robbery with intent to assault, unlawful possession of a\n\nfirearm, and unlawfully discharging a firearm.        Josselyn appealed\n\nto the Massachusetts Appeals Court, raising six issues, including\n\nthat the prosecutor improperly appealed to the jury's sympathy and\n\nincorrectly stated the burden of proof during the closing argument.\n\nThe Appeals Court affirmed Josselyn's conviction, and Josselyn\n\nfiled an application for leave to obtain further appellate review\n\n(ALOFAR) with the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC).         In\n\nhis ALOFAR, Josselyn raised the claims that he had pressed before\n\nthe Appeals Court, except for the two closing argument claims. The\n\nSJC declined to afford Josselyn further appellate review.\n\n           Josselyn then filed a petition for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus in federal district court, raising all the claims included\n\nin the ALOFAR and attempting to revive the closing argument claims.\n\nThe Commonwealth moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fthe closing argument claims were unexhausted.                   The district court\n\nagreed and dismissed the petition after Josselyn refused the\n\ndistrict court's offer to proceed on only the exhausted claims.\n\nJosselyn then asked the district court to issue a certificate of\n\nappealability       to    allow    consideration        of   whether       his    closing\n\nargument claims were unexhausted the petition should have been\n\nstayed instead of dismissed.              The court granted the certificate\n\ninsofar as it concerned the stay question, and we expanded it to\n\ninclude whether Josselyn had, in fact, exhausted the closing\n\nargument claims before the state court.                 We begin our analysis by\n\nconsidering this latter question.\n\n            Before seeking a federal writ of habeas corpus, a state\n\nprisoner    must       exhaust    available     state    remedies,        28     U.S.C.   ยง\n\n2254(b)(1), thus giving the state the first \"opportunity to pass\n\nupon and correct alleged violations of its prisoners' federal\n\nrights.\"         Duncan    v.    Henry,   513    U.S.    364,       365   (1995)     (per\n\ncuriam)(internal citations omitted).                  A claim for habeas corpus\n\nrelief    has    been     exhausted   where     the     claim   has       been    \"fairly\n\npresented\" to the state courts.            Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U.S. 27, 29\n\n(2004).    A claim is fairly presented so long as it is made in such\n\na   way   that    \"a    reasonable    jurist\"    would       have    recognized      \"the\n\nexistence of the federal question.\"              Casella v. Clemons, 207 F.3d\n\n18, 20 (1st Cir. 2000).            Where, as here, a state's highest court\n\noffers discretionary review, a petitioner must present that court\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fwith the opportunity to review the federal claim to have exhausted\n\navailable state remedies.     Baldwin, 541 U.S. at 29.   We review a\n\nruling that a habeas claim has not been exhausted de novo.\n\nAdelson v. DiPaola, 131 F.3d 259, 262 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n           The SJC has the power of discretionary review over\n\ndecisions of the Appeals Court.    An unsuccessful party before the\n\nAppeals Court seeks discretionary review from the SJC by filing an\n\nALOFAR.   Mass. R. App. Proc. 27.1 (b).   The ALOFAR must include \"a\n\nstatement of the points with respect to which further appellate\n\nreview of the decision of the appeals court is sought.\" Id. 27\n\n(b)(4).   Josselyn concedes that his ALOFAR did not include the\n\nclosing argument claims.     He argues, however, that he exhausted\n\nthese claims by presenting them to the Appeals Court.    To make this\n\nargument, Josselyn relies on the SJC's power to review all the\n\nissues that were before the Appeals Court, including issues not\n\nincluded in the ALOFAR.     See Bradford v. Baystate Med. Ctr., 613\n\nN.E.2d 82, 85 (Mass. 1993).     He also relies on the fact that the\n\nSJC justices had before them the Appeals Court's opinion when\n\nruling on his ALOFAR, and thus were aware that he had presented the\n\nclosing argument claims to the Appeals Court.1\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      When deciding whether to grant an ALOFAR, the SJC justices do\nnot have before them the Appeals Court briefs or record. These\nmaterials are only transmitted to the SJC once the ALOFAR is\ngranted.\n\n                                  -4-\n\f           We rejected this precise argument in Mele v. Fitchburg\n\nDist. Court., 850 F.2d 817, 823 (1st Cir. 1988) and are bound by\n\nthat decision, see N.H. Motor Transp. Ass'n v. Rowe, 448 F.3d 66,\n\n76 (1st Cir. 2006).   We observed, in part, that finding exhaustion\n\nwhere a claim appeared in the Appeals Court's decision but was\n\nomitted from the ALOFAR would unfairly require \"the SJC to go over\n\neach and every opinion of the [Appeals Court] with a fine tooth\n\ncomb, in an unremitting search for errors that the parties have\n\nneglected to pursue . . . .\"   Mele, 850 F.2d at 823.   The Supreme\n\nCourt recently applied similar reasoning in a case that presented\n\nan almost identical issue.     See Baldwin, 541 U.S. at 31 (noting\n\nthat any requirement that the highest state court reviews the lower\n\nappellate opinion to consider issues not in the petition for\n\ndiscretionary review \"would impose a serious burden upon judges of\n\nstate appellate courts\").    Accordingly, the continued vitality of\n\nMele is not in question.\n\n           Josselyn points to cases decided after Mele where we\n\nexamined materials outside of the ALOFAR to determine whether claims\n\nhad been fairly presented to the SJC.    See Goodrich v. Hall, 448\n\nF.3d 45, 48 (1st Cir. 2006);   Barresi v. Maloney, 296 F.3d 48, 52\n\nn.1 (1st Cir. 2002); Scarpa v. Dubois, 38 F.3d 1, 7 n.3 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).   These cases are, however, easily distinguishable.       In\n\nGoodrich, Barresi, and Scarpa, the petitioner's ALOFAR was ambiguous\n\nas to whether it included a particular federal claim.      In those\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fcircumstances,     we      permitted    the    examination       of    \"background\n\nmaterials\" to clarify the nature of claim that was made in the\n\nALOFAR.     See Goodrich, 448 F.3d at 48; Barresi, 296 F.3d at 52;\n\nScarpa, 38 F.3d at 7 n.3.2           Here, by contrast, Josselyn's ALOFAR\n\nomitted the closing argument claims entirely.                 Thus, there is no\n\nneed for clarification.\n\n             We turn next to the propriety of the district court's\n\ndismissal    of   Josselyn's    mixed       petition.     Prior       to   Congress'\n\nrevamping    of   habeas    corpus     as   part   of   the   Antiterrorism     and\n\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEPDA), the Supreme Court held\n\nthat a federal district court could not adjudicate a mixed habeas\n\ncorpus petition.     See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 518-19 (1982).\n\nCongress maintained this \"total exhaustion\" requirement for post-\n\nAEPDA petitions.        28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(b)(1)(A).            In AEDPA, Congress\n\nalso adopted a one-year statute of limitations for the filing of\n\nfully-exhausted claims in a federal habeas petition, id. ยง 2244(d),\n\nand did not provide for the tolling of the limitations period while\n\na mixed habeas petition was pending in federal court, Duncan v.\n\nWalker, 533 U.S. 167, 181-82 (2001).            As the Supreme Court recently\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The Commonwealth argues that the Supreme Court's decision in\nBaldwin abrogates our rule that background materials may be\nconsidered to interpret an otherwise ambiguous ALOFAR. See 541\nU.S. at 32 (holding that \"ordinarily a state prisoner does not\n'fairly present' a claim to a state court if that court must read\nbeyond the petition or brief\").     Because of our resolution of\nJosselyn's argument, we do not reach this question.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fexplained, the combined effect of these provisions has caused\n\ndifficulties for filers of mixed petitions:\n\n            As a result of the interplay between AEDPA's 1-\n            year statute of limitations and Lundy's\n            dismissal requirement, petitioners who come to\n            federal court with 'mixed' petitions run the\n            risk of forever losing their opportunity\n            for any federal review of their unexhausted\n            claims.   If a petitioner files a timely but\n            mixed petition in federal district court, and\n            the district court dismisses it under Lundy\n            after the limitations period has expired, this\n            will likely mean the termination of any federal\n            review.\n\nRhines v. Weber, 544 U.S. 269, 275 (2005).            This is often true, as\n\nwell, where the district court dismisses the mixed petition close\n\nto the end of the one-year period because \"the petitioner's chances\n\nof exhausting his claims in state court and refiling his petition\n\nin federal court before the limitations periods runs are slim.\" Id.\n\n            To remedy this problem, the Supreme Court approved a\n\n\"stay and abeyance\" procedure in Rhines.             Id. at 275.    Under this\n\nprocedure, rather than dismissing a mixed petition under Lundy, a\n\ndistrict court can stay the petition and hold it in abeyance while\n\nthe petitioner exhausts the unexhausted claims.             Id.    Once all of\n\nthe claims have been exhausted, the district court can lift the stay\n\nand adjudicate the petition.      Id.       The Court recognized, however,\n\nthat applying the \"stay and abeyance\" procedure too frequently could\n\nundermine   Congress'   design   in    AEDPA    to   encourage     finality   in\n\ncriminal proceedings and to streamline the federal habeas process.\n\nId. at 277.     Thus, to obtain a stay of a mixed petition, the\n\n                                      -7-\n\fpetitioner must show that there was \"good cause\" for failing to\n\nexhaust the state remedies, the claims are potentially meritorious,\n\nand   there    is   no    indication   that   the   petitioner   engaged   in\n\nintentionally dilatory tactics.         Id. at 278.\n\n              The district court dismissed Josselyn's petition several\n\nweeks before Rhines issued.            Josselyn argues that, under the\n\ncriteria set forth in Rhines, he was entitled to a stay.                   We\n\ndisagree because he has not demonstrated good cause for failing to\n\nexhaust his closing argument claims.          He argues good cause because\n\nhis counsel allegedly believed that he had exhausted the closing\n\nargument claims by presenting them to the Appeals Court.           But, such\n\na belief, if sincerely held, would have been unreasonable in light\n\nof Mele.   Ignorance of the law does not constitute good cause.3           Cf.\n\nIn re Kirkland, 86 F.3d 172, 176 (10th Cir. 1996) (stating that\n\nignorance of the law does not generally constitute good cause);\n\nTownsel v. Contra Costa County, Cal., 820 F.2d 319, 320 (9th Cir.\n\n1987) (similar).\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n      Justice Stevens, concurring in Rhines, suggested that the\n\"good cause\" requirement not be strictly imposed against pro se\npetitioners. See Rhines, 544 U.S. at 279 (Stevens, J., concurring)\n(noting concern that \"good cause\" requirement not become \"a trap\n[for] the unwary pro se prisoner\"). The application of the good\ncause requirement to pro se prisoner's is not implicated here,\nhowever, as Josselyn was represented by counsel throughout the\nstate proceedings.\n\n                                       -8-\n\f",

The Appeals Court affirmed Josselyn's conviction, and Josselyn filed an application for leave to obtain further appellate review (ALOFAR) with the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC).

In AEDPA, Congress also adopted a one-year statute of limitations for the filing of fully-exhausted claims in a federal habeas petition, <i>id.</i> &#167; 2244(d), and did not provide for the tolling of the limitations period while a mixed habeas petition was pending in federal court, <i>Duncan v.

In particular, we consider whether Josselyn's petition does, in fact, include unexhausted claims and, if so, whether the district court should have stayed the federal action while Josselyn exhausted these claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Josselyn was convicted in Massachusetts state court of armed robbery with intent to assault, unlawful possession of a firearm, and unlawfully discharging a firearm. Josselyn appealed to the Massachusetts Appeals Court, raising six issues, including that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the jury's sympathy and incorrectly stated the burden of proof during the closing argument. The Appeals Court affirmed Josselyn's conviction, and Josselyn filed an application for leave to obtain further appellate review (ALOFAR) with the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC). In his ALOFAR, Josselyn raised the claims that he had pressed before the Appeals Court, except for the two closing argument claims.

The Commonwealth moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that the closing argument claims were unexhausted. The district court agreed and dismissed the petition after Josselyn refused the district court's offer to proceed on only the exhausted claims. Josselyn then asked the district court to issue a certificate of appealability to allow consideration of whether his closing argument claims were unexhausted the petition should have been stayed instead of dismissed. The court granted the certificate insofar as it concerned the stay question, and we expanded it to include whether Josselyn had, in fact, exhausted the closing argument claims before the state court.

An unsuccessful party before the Appeals Court seeks discretionary review from the SJC by filing an ALOFAR. Mass. R.App. Proc. 27.1(b). The ALOFAR must include \"a statement of the points with respect to which further appellate review of the decision of the appeals court is sought.\" <i>Id.</i> 27(b)(4). Josselyn concedes that his ALOFAR did not include the closing argument claims. He argues, however, that he exhausted these claims by presenting them to the Appeals Court. To make this argument, Josselyn relies on the SJC's power to review all the issues that were before the Appeals Court, including issues not included in the ALOFAR. <i>See Bradford v. Baystate Med. Ctr.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">613</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></span>, 85 (1993). He also relies on the fact that the SJC justices had before them the Appeals Court's opinion when ruling on his ALOFAR, and thus were aware that he had presented the closing argument claims to the Appeals Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rejected this precise argument in <i>Mele v.

We observed, in part, that finding exhaustion where a claim appeared in the Appeals Court's decision but was omitted from the ALOFAR would unfairly require \"the SJC to go over each and every opinion of the [Appeals Court] with a fine tooth comb, in an unremitting search for errors that the parties have neglected to pursue . . . .\" <i>Mele,</i> 850 F.2d at 823. The Supreme Court recently applied similar reasoning in a case that presented an almost identical issue. <i>See Baldwin,</i> 541 U.S. at 31, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134723\"><a href=\"/opinion/134723/baldwin-v-reese/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

These cases are, however, easily distinguishable. In <i>Goodrich, Barresi,</i> and <i>Scarpa,</i> the petitioner's ALOFAR was ambiguous as to whether it included a particular federal claim. In those circumstances, we permitted the examination of \"background materials\" to clarify the nature of claim that was made in the ALOFAR. <i>See Goodrich,</i> 448 F.3d at 48; <i>Barresi,</i> 296 F.3d at 52; <i>Scarpa,</i> 38 F.3d at 7 n. 3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Here, by contrast, Josselyn's ALOFAR omitted the closing argument claims entirely.
