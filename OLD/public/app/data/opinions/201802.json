Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division,\nEmily A. Radford, Assistant Director, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, and Jean-Michel Voltaire, Trial Attorney, United States\nDepartment of Justice, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                        September 6, 2005\n\n\n\n\n__________\n*Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge. The petitioner, Martin Roberts, is\n\na native of Grenada.       He seeks judicial review of a decision of the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming a denial of his motion\n\nto reopen removal proceedings.        Concluding, as we do, that the BIA\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in deeming the petitioner's motion\n\nuntimely, we deny the petition.\n\n            The facts are uncomplicated.            The petitioner lawfully\n\nentered the United States on January 20, 1994.                   His B-2 visa\n\nfurnished him with authorization to remain for a period not to\n\nexceed six months.        He overstayed the expiration date and accepted\n\nemployment     without      authorization    from    the    Immigration     and\n\nNaturalization Service (INS).         The INS     subsequently apprehended\n\nhim and initiated removal proceedings.\n\n            The Immigration Judge (IJ), in an order dated February\n\n26, 1997, adjudged the petitioner removable.                 The IJ's order\n\ngranted him a one-year period within which to depart voluntarily\n\nand decreed that, should he fail to do so, he would be deported.\n\n            The petitioner ignored the voluntary departure deadline.\n\nHe remained in the United States and, in 2000, married a United\n\nStates citizen. A year later, his bride filed an I-130 application\n\non   his   behalf   for    a   relative   visa.      The   INS   approved   the\n\napplication.\n\n            The petitioner waited two more years and, in July of\n\n2003, moved to reopen the removal proceedings to allow pursuit of\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fan adjustment of status based on his marriage and the impending\n\nbirth of twins (who, when born, would be United States citizens).\n\nThe IJ denied the motion on timeliness grounds, concluding that the\n\npetitioner's marriage was not an exceptional circumstance that\n\nwarranted a relaxation of the usual time line governing motions to\n\nreopen.   See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b) (establishing time frame for\n\nfiling motions to reopen).   The BIA affirmed the IJ’s decision.\n\nThis petition for judicial review followed.\n\n          In this venue, the petitioner asserts that because he\n\ndemonstrated prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status to\n\nlawful permanent residency through his bona fide marriage to a\n\nUnited States citizen, see 8 U.S.C. § 1255(e), the BIA erred in\n\nadhering slavishly to its temporal guideposts.    He adds that the\n\nBIA's failure to weigh certain factors in his favor, including his\n\ngood character and the hardship that would befall his family\n\n(including his two children) as a consequence of his deportation,\n\nconstituted an abuse of discretion.\n\n          Although the contours of the petitioner's arguments are\n\nsomewhat blurred, it seems that he is contending not only that the\n\nBIA abused its discretion in finding untimeliness but also that it\n\nerred in not disregarding timeliness concerns and invoking its sua\n\nsponte authority to reopen the case.    We address these two facets\n\nof the petitioner's claim separately.\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f          We begin with bedrock: \"motions to reopen are disfavored\n\nin immigration practice because of the compelling public interests\n\nin finality and the expeditious processing of proceedings.\"           Falae\n\nv. Gonzáles, 411 F.3d 11, 14-15 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing INS v.\n\nAbudu, 485 U.S. 94, 107-08 (1988)).        Consequently, we review the\n\nBIA's denial of a motion to reopen based on timeliness grounds\n\nunder a highly deferential abuse of discretion standard.         See id.;\n\nJupiter v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 487, 490 (1st Cir. 2005).          In order\n\nto prevail under this standard, the movant must carry the heavy\n\nburden of establishing that the BIA made an error of law or acted\n\nin a manifestly arbitrary or capricious manner. See Carter v. INS,\n\n90 F.3d 14, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          The regulations applicable to immigration cases, which\n\nhave the force of law, stipulate that motions to reopen removal\n\nproceedings   must   be   filed   within   ninety   days   of   the   final\n\nadministrative order of removal.         See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).\n\nThe petitioner's motion was filed well outside this ninety-day\n\nwindow and the BIA denied the motion because it had not been timely\n\nfiled.   The petitioner counters that it was impossible for him to\n\nfile a timely motion to reopen because his request for reopening\n\nstemmed from nuptials that did not occur until after the ninety-day\n\nwindow had closed.   To this, he adds that he was forced to postpone\n\nthe filing of his motion further because of (i) the bureaucratic\n\ndelay in the approval of his I-130 immediate relative application\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fand (ii) the statutory limitation applicable to persons who flout\n\nvoluntary departure orders.\n\n             We digress for a moment because the second half of that\n\nargument requires an explanation.            Once the petitioner did not\n\ndepart voluntarily by the imposed deadline — February 27, 1998 — he\n\nbecame   ineligible   for   certain    immigration     benefits,   including\n\nadjustment of status, for a period of five years.             See 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1229c(d).1     Since he waited for the passage of that five-year\n\nperiod   before   moving    to   reopen     the   removal   proceedings,   the\n\npetitioner's motion was four years and 275 days late.            See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.23(b)(1).\n\n             Moving to the substance of the petitioner's arguments, we\n\ndisagree that the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion\n\nto reopen.     Although the time limits for filing motions to reopen\n\nmay be relaxed upon a showing of exceptional circumstances, see 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1003.23 (b)(4), the mere fact that a petitioner makes out\n\na prima facie case for relief does not ensure the favorable\n\nexercise of that discretion by the BIA.               See id. § 1003.2(a);\n\nFalae, 411 F.3d at 14-15.          The BIA still possesses the right\n\n(indeed, the duty) to weigh the equities of the case.\n\n\n\n     1\n      Although this statute, read literally, provides for a ten-\nyear period of ineligibility, a shorter five-year period applies to\nthe petitioner because removal proceedings were instituted in his\ncase prior to the repeal of former 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(e)(2)(A), which\nlimited ineligibility for benefits to five years from and after the\nflouted departure deadline.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f            In this instance the equities are mixed.          On the one\n\nhand, the petitioner's marriage is bona fide, his character is\n\nunblemished, and his removal apparently will result in hardship for\n\nhis wife and children.       On the other hand, the petitioner's case\n\ndoes not fall within the categorical exceptions to the temporal\n\ndeadline prescribed by the applicable regulation.       See 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1003.23(b)(4) (providing that exceptions may be granted if a motion\n\nto reopen is, for example, based on an application for asylum or\n\nwithholding of removal in light of changed country circumstances,\n\nor addresses an order that was entered in absentia, or was jointly\n\nfiled by the alien and the government).       Moreover, the petitioner\n\nthrice flouted the immigration laws — by overstaying his original\n\nvisa, by working without a \"green card,\" and by disregarding his\n\ncourt-ordered    voluntary     departure   deadline.      His     current\n\neligibility for an adjustment of status is a direct result of those\n\nmisdeeds.\n\n            Within   broad    limits,    reconciling   such     competing\n\ncentrifugal and centripetal forces is for the BIA, not for the\n\ncourt of appeals.    See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Falae, 411\n\nF.3d at 16 (explaining that the exercise of the BIA's discretion\n\nentails \"the weighing of multiple factors, not all of which point\n\nin the same direction.\"); Luis v. INS, 196 F.3d 36, 39 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (finding the alien's equities to be outweighed by adverse\n\nfactors and, thus, upholding the denial of his untimely motion to\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\freopen).    On this scumbled record, we cannot say that the BIA's\n\nresolution of this mix of mitigating and aggravating circumstances\n\nwas in any way arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n\n           We add only that we fully understand the BIA's reluctance\n\nto reward the petitioner's intransigence by granting his motion to\n\nreopen.    Taking a different tack would have served to encourage,\n\nrather than deter, disobedience of the federal immigration laws.\n\nWe conclude, therefore, that the BIA acted within the realm of its\n\ndiscretion in denying the motion to reopen as untimely.\n\n           We now turn to the petitioner's challenge to the BIA's\n\nrefusal to use its sua sponte power as a vehicle for granting his\n\nmotion to reopen.   Federal regulations state that the BIA \"may at\n\nany time reopen or reconsider on its own motion any case in which\n\nit has rendered a decision.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2.   This provision is\n\ninapplicable here because the BIA had never rendered a decision in\n\nthe petitioner's case (he did not appeal from the IJ's original\n\norder).    Its first and only involvement was when it denied the\n\npetitioner's motion to reopen.    The plain meaning of 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1003.2(a) is to the effect that the BIA cannot invoke its sua\n\nsponte authority in a matter if it had not rendered any decisions\n\nin the matter prior to the time when it rejected the petitioner's\n\nappeal from a denial of a motion to reopen.   See Prado v. Reno, 198\n\nF.3d 286, 292 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f           There is a possible loophole.           Like the BIA, the IJ\n\nenjoys authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte, see 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1003.23(b)(1), and unlike the BIA, the IJ did issue a decision in\n\nthe   original     removal   proceedings.     Theoretically,         then,    the\n\npetitioner might have contended that the BIA should have compelled\n\nthe IJ to reopen based on the IJ’s sua sponte authority.                     See,\n\ne.g., Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, 371 F.3d 246, 247 (5th Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n           With the facts of this case as they are, however, any\n\nsuch effort would have been procedurally barred.               By statute, a\n\ncourt may review a final order of removal only if \"the alien has\n\nexhausted all administrative remedies available to [him] as of\n\nright.\"   8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1).       Courts must take that exhaustion\n\nrequirement very seriously.        See Sousa v. INS, 226 F.3d 28, 31-32\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).          If an appeal to the BIA does not explicitly\n\nrequest that the BIA set aside the IJ's refusal to invoke her sua\n\nsponte authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), the petitioner has\n\nnot preserved the issue for judicial review.                  See Olujoke v.\n\nGonzáles, 411 F.3d 16, 22-23 (1st Cir. 2005) (holding that the\n\ndoctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies bans attempts by\n\npetitioners to resurrect on judicial review issues which were not\n\nraised    before    the    BIA);   Prado,   198   F.3d   at    292    (finding\n\npetitioner's claim unreviewable because she had failed to request\n\nthat the BIA invoke its sua sponte authority); see also Bernal-\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fVallejo v. INS, 195 F.3d 56, 64 (1st Cir. 1999) (explaining that\n\n\"usually issues not raised before the BIA may not be raised for the\n\nfirst time on petition for review.\").\n\n          This   line   of   authority   is   dispositive   here.   The\n\npetitioner did not ask the BIA to compel the IJ to reopen the\n\nproceedings based on the latter's sua sponte authority to do so.\n\nWe thus would lack jurisdiction to review any such claim even if we\n\nwere to impute one to the petitioner.2\n\n          We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nthe petition for judicial review is denied.\n\n\n\n          So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      We note that, apart from the petitioner's failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies, it is at least arguable that our review of\nthis challenge would in all events be barred because we lack\nauthority to review issues committed to the agency's unfettered\ndiscretion.   See Prado, 198 F.3d at 292; Luis, 196 F.3d at 40-41;\nsee also Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 821 (1985) (explaining\nthat \"judicial review of an administrative agency's decision is not\nto be had if the statute in question is drawn so that a court would\nhave no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency's\nexercise of discretion\"). In the circumstances at hand, we need\nnot address this issue.\n\n                                  -9-\n\f",

He seeks judicial review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming a denial of his motion to reopen removal proceedings. Concluding, as we do, that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in deeming the petitioner's motion untimely, we deny the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are uncomplicated. The petitioner lawfully entered the United States on January 20, 1994. His B-2 visa furnished him with authorization to remain for a period not to exceed six months. He overstayed the expiration date and accepted employment without authorization from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The INS subsequently apprehended him and initiated removal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Immigration Judge (IJ), in an order dated February 26, 1997, adjudged the petitioner removable. The IJ's order granted him a one-year period within which to depart voluntarily and decreed that, should he fail to do so, he would be deported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner ignored the voluntary departure deadline. He remained in the United States and, in 2000, married a United States citizen. A year later, his bride filed an I-130 application on his behalf for a relative visa. The INS approved the application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner waited two more years and, in July of 2003, moved to reopen the removal proceedings to allow pursuit of an adjustment of status based on his marriage and the impending birth of twins (who, when born, would be United States citizens). The IJ denied the motion on timeliness grounds, concluding that the petitioner's marriage was not an exceptional circumstance that warranted a relaxation of the usual time line governing motions to reopen. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.23(b) (establishing time frame for filing motions to reopen). The BIA affirmed the IJ's decision. This petition for judicial review followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, the petitioner asserts that because he demonstrated prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status to lawful permanent residency through his bona fide marriage to a United States citizen, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(e), the BIA erred in adhering slavishly to its temporal guideposts. He adds that the BIA's failure to weigh certain factors in his favor, including his good character and the hardship that would befall his family (including his two children) as a consequence of his deportation, constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the contours of the petitioner's arguments are somewhat blurred, it seems that he is contending not only that the BIA abused its discretion in finding untimeliness but also that it erred in not disregarding timeliness concerns and invoking its sua sponte authority to reopen the case. We address these two facets of the petitioner's claim separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with bedrock: \"motions to reopen are disfavored in immigration practice because of the compelling public interests in finality and the expeditious processing of proceedings.\" <i>Falae v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790569\"><a href=\"/opinion/790569/michael-olusean-falae-aka-vincent-olanrewaju-adeyemi-v-alberto-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 14-15 (1st Cir.2005) (citing <i>INS v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span> (1988)). Consequently, we review the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen based on timeliness grounds under a highly deferential abuse of discretion standard. <i>See id.; Jupiter v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201441\"><a href=\"/opinion/201441/jupiter-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span>, 490 (1st Cir.2005). In order to prevail under this standard, the movant must carry the heavy burden of establishing that the BIA made an error of law or acted in a manifestly arbitrary or capricious manner. <i>See Carter v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196896\"><a href=\"/opinion/196896/carter-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 16-17 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulations applicable to immigration cases, which have the force of law, stipulate that motions to reopen removal proceedings must be filed within ninety days of the final administrative order of removal. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.23(b)(1). The petitioner's motion was filed well outside this ninety-day window and the BIA denied the motion because it had not been timely filed. The petitioner counters that it was impossible for him to file a timely motion to reopen because his request for reopening stemmed from nuptials that did not occur until after the ninety-day window had closed. To this, he adds that he was forced to postpone the filing of his motion further because of (i) the bureaucratic delay in the approval of his I-130 immediate relative application and (ii) the statutory limitation applicable to persons who flout voluntary departure orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We digress for a moment because the second half of that argument requires an explanation. Once the petitioner did not depart voluntarily by the imposed deadline &#8212; February 27, 1998 &#8212; he became ineligible for certain immigration benefits, including adjustment of status, for a period of five years. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Since he waited for the passage of that five-year period before moving to reopen the removal proceedings, the petitioner's motion was four years and 275 days late. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.23(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moving to the substance of the petitioner's arguments, we disagree that the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen. Although the time limits for filing motions to reopen may be relaxed upon a showing of exceptional circumstances, <i>see</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.23(b)(4), the mere fact that a petitioner makes out a prima facie case for relief does not ensure the favorable exercise of that discretion by the BIA. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1003.2(a); <i>Falae,</i> 411 F.3d at 14-15. The BIA still possesses the right (indeed, the duty) to weigh the equities of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance the equities are mixed. On the one hand, the petitioner's marriage is bona fide, his character is unblemished, and his removal apparently will result in hardship for his wife and children. On the other hand, the petitioner's case does not fall within the categorical exceptions to the temporal deadline prescribed by the applicable regulation. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.23(b)(4) (providing that exceptions may be granted if a motion to reopen is, for example, based on an application for asylum or withholding of removal in light of changed country circumstances, or addresses an order that was entered in absentia, or was jointly filed by the alien and the government).
