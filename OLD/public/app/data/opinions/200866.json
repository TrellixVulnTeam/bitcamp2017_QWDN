On January 19, 1997, César Castro\n\nGómez was apprehended several miles off the coast of Puerto Rico\n\nwhile piloting a boat containing two other passengers and some 762\n\nkilograms     of    cocaine.       A   jury   subsequently    convicted    him   of\n\npossession, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, and\n\nattempted importation of the cocaine -- offenses for which he was\n\nsentenced to concurrent life terms because of his significant\n\ncriminal history.        In this appeal, the principal issue is whether\n\nthe district court erred in declining to instruct the jury to\n\nconsider whether Castro unwillingly participated in these crimes\n\nbecause he was under threats sufficiently grave to ground an\n\naffirmative        defense   of    duress.     See,   e.g.,   United    States   v.\n\nArthurs, 73 F.3d 444, 448 (1st Cir. 1996) (duress occasioned by \"1)\n\nan immediate threat of serious bodily injury or death, 2) a well-\n\ngrounded belief that the threat will be carried out, and 3) no\n\nreasonable opportunity to escape or otherwise to frustrate the\n\nthreat\" can exonerate one from liability for otherwise criminal\n\nconduct).\n\n              The district court denied Castro's request for a duress\n\ninstruction because it found the evidence insufficient to support\n\na   finding    that    Castro      lacked     an   opportunity   to    escape    the\n\nthreatening situation.            See United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394,\n\n415 (1980).        We begin our discussion of Castro's challenge to this\n\nruling by describing the evidence relevant to the putative duress\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fdefense in the light most favorable to Castro.             See Arthurs, 73\n\nF.3d at 448; United States v. Coady, 809 F.2d 119, 122 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).   Our review is de novo.      See United States v. Maxwell, 254\n\nF.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n              In early January 1997, Luis Rafael Santiago Rodríguez was\n\nhaving trouble securing a captain for the \"go-fast\" boat that he\n\nhoped to use to retrieve a load of cocaine that was to be dropped\n\ninto the sea by his Colombian suppliers.        At that time, Castro was\n\nworking in a legitimate business for Marcelino Pérez Soto, one of\n\nSantiago's confederates.         Knowing that Castro was capable of\n\ndriving the go-fast boat skillfully, Santiago had Pérez arrange a\n\nmeeting between himself and Castro (as well as Pérez and Raul\n\nOrlando Palacios-Díaz, an intimidating henchman of Santiago's) at\n\na pizza parlor.      At the meeting, Santiago asked Castro to pick up\n\nthe load of cocaine for him.        Castro, who had served significant\n\njail   time    for   drug   trafficking   offenses   and   was   then   under\n\nsupervised release, refused. Santiago begged Castro to reconsider,\n\nbut Castro was adamant.\n\n              Within two or three days, Pérez appeared at Castro's\n\nhouse and told him that Santiago would be along momentarily.\n\nSantiago and Palacios-Díaz arrived a few minutes later.            Santiago\n\ntold Castro that Castro had to solve his transportation problem.\n\nCastro felt threatened and agreed to get into Santiago's vehicle.\n\nThe group drove to Fajardo.       On the way, Castro saw that Santiago\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fand Palacios-Díaz were armed.      Upon arrival in Fajardo, Santiago\n\ntold Castro to bring him the load of cocaine or \"go to hell.\"           As\n\nhe said this, Santiago was touching his gun.          Castro understood\n\nSantiago to be making a death threat.\n\n            Under the circumstances, Castro saw no alternative but to\n\ncomply with Santiago's directive.        Castro and the armed Palacios-\n\nDíaz boarded the go-fast boat and headed out towards the designated\n\ndrop point, which was approximately 90 miles off the coast of\n\nPuerto Rico.   When the boat was some 60 miles out, Castro pretended\n\nthat they had arrived at the drop point and began to circle as if\n\nhe were waiting for the plane.    At nightfall, Castro drove the boat\n\nback to Puerto Rico.     The boat was met by a group of men including\n\nan irate Santiago, who had received word from the Colombian pilots\n\nthat nobody was at the drop point.         After some angry discussion\n\nduring which Castro feared that he would be killed, the group\n\ndispersed.\n\n            Several days later, on January 18, 1997, Pérez called and\n\ntold Castro to meet him at the same pizza parlor where the first\n\nmeeting with Santiago had taken place.         Castro assumed that the\n\nepisode earlier in the week \"was over with\" and complied.              Soon\n\nafter Castro's arrival, Santiago and Palacios-Díaz showed up.\n\nSantiago informed Castro in a threatening manner that Castro would\n\nbe making another attempt to retrieve the load of cocaine on the\n\nfollowing    day.   At   first,   Castro   refused,   but   Santiago    and\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fPalacios-Díaz soon intimidated him into going along with the plan.\n\nSantiago ordered Palacios-Díaz to stay overnight with Castro at\n\nCastro's house and to make sure that Castro showed up the next day.\n\n          The following morning, Santiago picked up Castro and\n\nPalacios-Díaz   at    Castro's   house.     Again,   the   group    drove   to\n\nFajardo, where Castro, the armed Palacios-Díaz, and Pérez boarded\n\nthe boat and headed out towards the rendezvous point.              This time,\n\nthe Colombian aircraft spotted the boat and dumped 22 bales of\n\ncocaine into the sea.      The group retrieved the bales and began to\n\nmake its way back toward Puerto Rico.        But the Coast Guard spotted\n\nthe vessel, boarded it, discovered the cocaine, and arrested the\n\nvessel's occupants.\n\n          Castro contends that the scenario just described could\n\nsupport a reasonable finding that his presence in the boat was\n\nprocured by duress, and that the district court therefore erred in\n\nrejecting his request that the jury be instructed to consider\n\nwhether he had established duress as an affirmative defense.                As\n\npreviously   noted,     the   court     predicated   its   refusal     on    a\n\ndetermination that the jury could not reasonably find that Castro\n\nlacked an opportunity to escape Santiago's coercion.          See Arthurs,\n\n73 F.3d at 448.      Among the evidence on which the court focused in\n\nreaching its determination was Castro's choice to go to the pizza\n\nparlor a second time when Pérez called him:\n\n                 Also there were opportunities that\n          [Castro] had not to get involved, at least in\n\n                                      -5-\n\f            the second [trip to sea] . . . . [H]e had\n            experience of what happened in the first [trip\n            to sea], again the evidence showed that the\n            same pattern of meetings and conversations\n            that took place in the first attempt two or\n            three days earlier was taking place in the\n            second attempt.    For example, he was home\n            minding his own business, he got called by\n            Marcelino Pérez and he told him he wanted to\n            see him at [the pizza parlor]. He could have\n            said, \"I'm not going, what's it for, is\n            [Santiago] going to be there? I am not going\n            to do this\" and he could have asked Marcelino,\n            \"why do you want to see me?       No, I'm not\n            going. Explain to me on the phone\" instead of\n            submitting himself to a situation where he\n            could again meet with Santiago.\n\nWe see no error in this determination.\n\n            In   assessing    whether      a   defendant    has    established\n\nsufficient grounds to mount a duress defense, courts do not examine\n\nthe defendant's subjective perceptions about whether the threat was\n\nlikely to be acted upon or whether escape was possible.             Rather, as\n\nsuggested   by   our    use   of   the   qualifiers    \"well-grounded\"       and\n\n\"reasonable\"     in   describing   the     elements   of   the    defense,   see\n\nArthurs, 73 F.3d at 448, the inquiry hypothesizes a defendant of\n\nordinary firmness and judgment and asks what such a defendant was\n\nlikely to have experienced or how such a defendant was likely to\n\nhave acted, see 1 LaFave & Scott, Substantive Criminal Law § 5.3,\n\nat 619, 621 & n.30.1 (West 1996 & 2003 Supp.).             Here, we think the\n\ndistrict court correctly concluded that no person of ordinary\n\nfirmness and judgment who wished to escape coercion of the type\n\nthat Castro had so recently experienced would have returned to the\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fpizza   parlor   upon   Pérez's   second   summons.   In   our   view,   a\n\nreasonable person genuinely wishing to escape the predicament\n\nCastro described would have foreseen the likelihood that the\n\nsummons pertained to the as-yet uncompleted importation scheme. He\n\nwould not have gone to the pizza parlor, but instead would have\n\nsummoned law enforcement officials to protect himself and his\n\nfamily.    See id. at 619 n.33 (collecting cases where a duress\n\ndefense was denied because the defendant had an opportunity but\n\nfailed to avail himself of government protection); id., 2003 Supp.\n\nat 125 n.33; cf. id. at 622 (\"It is . . . generally recognized that\n\na defendant can lose [a duress] defense by his own fault in getting\n\ninto the difficulty.    Thus, . . . the duress defense is unavailable\n\nif the defendant recklessly placed himself in a situation in which\n\nit was probable that he would be subjected to duress.\").         Castro's\n\nfailure to do so deprived him of the opportunity to press a duress\n\ndefense.\n\n           Castro makes three additional arguments that warrant only\n\na brief word.     Castro asserts that the district court erred in\n\npermitting a government witness to testify about the street value\n\nof the cocaine.     But the testimony was relevant to, inter alia,\n\nwhether Castro might have had a motive other than duress for\n\nparticipating in the crime. And in any event, the evidence against\n\nCastro was so overwhelming that this testimony was extraordinarily\n\nunlikely to have impacted the jury's deliberations.         Castro also\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fcontends that the court erred in denying his motion to issue a writ\n\nof habeas corpus ad testificandum for Elliot Garcia Agosto, a\n\ncontemplated defense witness who was incarcerated at the time of\n\nCastro's trial.    The record reveals, however, that the court\n\nallowed Castro's motion on reconsideration.      This argument is thus\n\nbuilt on a faulty foundation.           Finally, Castro perfunctorily\n\nasserts that, in calculating his criminal history, the court erred\n\nin failing to treat his prior sentences as \"related\" and thus not\n\nseparately countable.   Because this argument was not raised below\n\nand is presented on appeal in a sketchy and wholly unsubstantiated\n\nmanner, we will not address it.    See United States v. Zannino, 895\n\nF.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f",

A jury subsequently convicted him of possession, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, and attempted importation of the cocaine &#8212; offenses for which he was sentenced to concurrent life terms because of his significant criminal history. In this appeal, the principal issue is whether the district court erred in declining to instruct the jury to consider whether Castro unwillingly participated in these crimes because he was under threats sufficiently grave to ground an affirmative defense of duress. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Arthurs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196518\"><a href=\"/opinion/196518/united-states-v-arthurs/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span>, 448 (1st Cir.1996) (duress occasioned by \"1) an immediate threat of serious bodily injury or death, 2) a well-grounded belief that the threat will be carried out, and 3) no reasonable opportunity to escape or otherwise to frustrate the threat\" can exonerate one from liability for otherwise criminal conduct).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied Castro's request for a duress instruction because it found the evidence insufficient to support a finding that Castro lacked an opportunity to escape the threatening situation. <i>See United States v. Bailey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110175\"><a href=\"/opinion/110175/united-states-v-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></a></span>, 415, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110175\"><a href=\"/opinion/110175/united-states-v-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span> (1980). We begin our discussion of Castro's challenge to this ruling by describing the evidence relevant to the putative duress defense in the light most favorable to Castro. <i>See Arthurs,</i> 73 F.3d at 448; <i>United States v. Coady,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481634\"><a href=\"/opinion/481634/united-states-v-neil-patrick-coady/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span>, 122 (1st Cir.1987). Our review is de novo. <i>See United States v. Maxwell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199478\"><a href=\"/opinion/199478/united-states-v-maxwell-anthony/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early January 1997, Luis Rafael Santiago Rodr&#237;guez was having trouble securing a captain for the \"go-fast\" boat that he hoped to use to retrieve a load of cocaine that was to be dropped into the sea by his Colombian suppliers. At that time, Castro was working in a legitimate business for Marcelino P&#233;rez Soto, one of Santiago's confederates. Knowing that Castro was capable of driving the go-fast boat skillfully, Santiago had P&#233;rez arrange a meeting between himself and Castro (as well as P&#233;rez and Raul Orlando Palacios-D&#237;az, an intimidating henchman of Santiago's) at a pizza parlor. At the meeting, Santiago asked Castro to pick up the load of cocaine for him. Castro, who had served significant jail time for drug trafficking offenses and was then under supervised release, refused. Santiago begged Castro to reconsider, but Castro was adamant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within two or three days, P&#233;rez appeared at Castro's house and told him that Santiago would be along momentarily. Santiago and Palacios-D&#237;az arrived a few minutes later. Santiago told Castro that Castro had to solve his transportation problem. Castro felt threatened and agreed to get into Santiago's vehicle. The group drove to Fajardo. On the way, Castro saw that Santiago and Palacios-D&#237;az were armed. Upon arrival in Fajardo, Santiago told Castro to bring him the load of cocaine or \"go to bell.\" As he said this, Santiago was touching his gun. Castro understood Santiago to be making a death threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the circumstances, Castro saw no alternative but to comply with Santiago's directive. Castro and the armed Palacios-D&#237;az boarded the go-fast boat and headed out towards the designated drop point, which was approximately 90 miles off the coast of Puerto Rico. When the boat was some 60 miles out, Castro pretended that they had arrived at the drop point and began to circle as if he were waiting for the plane. At nightfall, Castro drove the boat back to Puerto Rico. The boat was met by a group of men including an irate Santiago, who had received word from the Colombian pilots that nobody was at the drop point. After some angry discussion during which Castro feared that he would be killed, the group dispersed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several days later, on January 18, 1997, P&#233;rez called and told Castro to meet him at the same pizza parlor where the first meeting with Santiago had taken place. Castro assumed that the episode earlier in the week \"was over with\" and complied. Soon after Castro's arrival, Santiago and Palacios-D&#237;az showed up. Santiago informed Castro in a threatening manner that Castro would be making another attempt to retrieve the load of cocaine on the following day. At first, Castro refused, but Santiago and Palacios-D&#237;az soon intimidated him into going along with the plan. Santiago ordered Palacios-D&#237;az to stay overnight with Castro at Castro's house and to make sure that Castro showed up the next day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following morning, Santiago picked up Castro and Palacios-D&#237;az at Castro's house. Again, the group drove to Fajardo, where Castro, the armed Palacios-D&#237;az, and P&#233;rez boarded the boat and headed out towards the rendezvous point. This time, the Colombian aircraft spotted the boat and dumped 22 bales of cocaine into the sea. The group retrieved the bales and began to make its way back toward Puerto Rico. But the Coast Guard spotted the vessel, boarded it, discovered the cocaine, and arrested the vessel's occupants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Castro contends that the scenario just described could support a reasonable finding that his presence in the boat was procured by duress, and that the district court therefore erred in rejecting his request that the jury be instructed to consider whether he had established duress as an affirmative defense. As previously noted, the court predicated its refusal on a determination that the jury could not reasonably find that Castro lacked an opportunity to escape Santiago's coercion. <i>See Arthurs,</i> 73 F.3d at 448. Among the evidence on which the court focused in reaching its determination was Castro's choice to go to the pizza parlor a second time when P&#233;rez called him:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also there were opportunities that [Castro] had not to get involved, at least in the second [trip to sea] .... [H]e had experience of what happened in the first [trip to sea], again the evidence showed that the same pattern of meetings and conversations that took place in the first attempt two or three days earlier was taking place in the second attempt. For example, he was home minding his own business, he got called by Marcelino P&#233;rez and he told him he wanted to see him at [the pizza parlor]. He could have said, \"I'm not going, what's it for, is [Santiago] going to be there? I am not going to do this\" and he could have asked Marcelino, \"why do you want to see me? No, I'm not going. Explain to me on the phone\" instead of submitting himself to a situation where he could again meet with Santiago.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no error in this determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing whether a defendant has established sufficient grounds to mount a duress defense, courts do not examine the defendant's subjective perceptions about whether the threat was likely to be acted upon or whether escape was possible. Rather, as suggested by our use of the qualifiers \"well-grounded\" and \"reasonable\" in describing the elements of the defense, <i>see Arthurs,</i> 73 F.3d at 448, the inquiry hypothesizes a defendant of ordinary firmness and judgment and asks what such a defendant was likely to have experienced or how such a defendant was likely to have acted, <i>see</i> 1 LaFave &amp; Scott, <i>Substantive Criminal Law</i> &#167; 5.3, at 619, 621 &amp; n. 30.1 (West 1996 &amp; 2003 Supp.). Here, we think the district court correctly concluded that no person of ordinary firmness and judgment who wished to escape coercion of the type that Castro had so recently experienced would have returned to the pizza parlor upon P&#233;rez's second summons. In our view, a reasonable person genuinely wishing to escape the predicament Castro described would have foreseen the likelihood that the summons pertained to the as-yet uncompleted importation scheme. He would not have gone to the pizza parlor, but instead would have summoned law enforcement officials to protect himself and his family. <i>See id.</i> at 619 n. 33 (collecting cases where a duress defense was denied because the defendant had an opportunity but failed to avail himself of government protection); <i>id.,</i> 2003 Supp. at 125 n. 33; <i>cf. id.</i> at 622 (\"It is ... generally recognized that a defendant can lose [a duress] defense by his own fault in getting into the difficulty. Thus, ... the duress defense is unavailable if the defendant recklessly placed himself in a situation in which it was probable that he would be subjected to duress.\"). Castro's failure to do so deprived him of the opportunity to press a duress defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Castro makes three additional arguments that warrant only a brief word. Castro asserts that the district court erred in permitting a government witness to testify about the street value of the cocaine. But the testimony was relevant to, <i>inter</i> <i>alia,</i> whether Castro might have had a motive other than duress for participating in the crime. And in any event, the evidence against Castro was so overwhelming that this testimony was extraordinarily unlikely to have impacted the jury's deliberations. Castro also contends that the court erred in denying his motion to issue a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum for Elliot Garcia Agosto, a contemplated defense witness who was incarcerated at the time of Castro's trial. The record reveals, however, that the court <i>allowed</i> Castro's motion on reconsideration. This argument is thus built on a faulty foundation. Finally, Castro perfunctorily asserts that, in calculating his criminal history, the court erred in failing to treat his prior sentences as \"related\" and thus not separately countable. Because this argument was not raised below and is presented on appeal in a sketchy and wholly unsubstantiated manner, we will not address it. <i>See United States v.
