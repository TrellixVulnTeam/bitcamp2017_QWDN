After a thorough review of the record and of\n\nthe parties' submissions, we affirm.\n\n              The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") found\n\nthat Stewart's 1960 firearms conviction would have been admissible\n\nhad   Stewart     taken    the   stand.    Petitioner        Francis   Stewart\n\n(\"Stewart\") argues this conclusion was based on an erroneous\n\nfactual premise:      that he was represented by counsel during the\n\n1960 proceeding.     In a federal habeas action, the factual findings\n\nof the state court are presumed correct, and the petitioner has the\n\nburden   of    rebutting   the   presumption    by   clear    and   convincing\n\nevidence.     See 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(e)(1).      The 1960 docket sheet shows\n\nStewart did receive appointed counsel.          Stewart claims otherwise,\n\nbut his assertion, standing alone, is insufficient to meet the\n\nclear and convincing evidence standard.\n\n              As for the admissibility of the misdemeanor conviction\n\nfor operating a motor vehicle under the influence, we agree with\n\nthe state appellate court's assessment that admission of the\n\nevidence would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under\n\nthe standard in Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18 (1967), given\n\nthat evidence of four prior felony convictions also would have been\n\navailable to impeach Stewart.        As the trial court planned to admit\n\nthe evidence in the event Stewart testified, it was clear Stewart\n\nonly could prevent admission of the evidence by choosing not to\n\ntestify.      Thus, his attorney's advice to this effect was correct.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f         Ultimately, then, the advice Stewart received in the\n\ncourse of deciding whether to testify was correct.
