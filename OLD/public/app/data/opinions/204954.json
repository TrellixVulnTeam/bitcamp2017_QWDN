Southern Union has failed to show\n      meaningful    inconsistency,    much   less    irrational\n      inconsistency.   Our conclusion above that the EPA has\n      over time engaged in a rational shift toward a policy of\n      federal enforcement disposes of this due process argument\n      as well.\n\f",
