The State of Florida and the Commonwealth of\n\nMassachusetts have stricken from the roll of lawyers admitted to\n\npractice before the court Attorney F. Lee Bailey for, inter alia,\n\nmisappropriating client funds.         See In re Bailey, 786 N.E.2d 337\n\n(Mass. 2003); Fla. Bar v. Bailey, 803 So.2d 683 (Fla. 2001).             A\n\nthree-judge panel of the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts subsequently ordered Bailey disbarred\n\nunder its reciprocal discipline rule.         See Mass. L.R. 83.6(2)(D).\n\nWe affirm.\n\n            Before addressing the merits of Bailey's appeal, we\n\nbriefly consider the basis for appellate jurisdiction over a\n\ndistrict court's decision to discipline a member of its bar.            See\n\nGarcia-Velazquez v. Frito Lay Snacks Caribbean, 358 F.3d 6, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (stating that an appellate court has a duty in every\n\ncase   to   satisfy   itself   of   subject   matter   jurisdiction).    An\n\nattorney discipline proceeding under a reciprocal discipline rule\n\nis a case or controversy under Article III.            See In re Calvo, 88\n\nF.3d 962, 965-66 (11th Cir. 1996); In re Palmisano, 70 F.3d 483,\n\n484-85 (7th Cir. 1995).         Moreover, a district court's decision\n\ndisbarring an attorney from practice is a final judgment as it\n\n\"ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court\n\nto do but execute the judgment.\"       Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S.\n\n229, 233 (1945).      We therefore join other circuits in concluding\n\nthat we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291 to review a final\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\forder disbarring an attorney.         See In re Martin, 400 F.3d 836, 840\n\n(10th Cir. 2005); In re North, 383 F.3d 871, 874-75 (9th Cir.\n\n2004); In re Surrick, 338 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2003).\n\n            Turning to the merits, Bailey argues that the district\n\ncourt erred by declining to convene a hearing to allow him to\n\npresent new evidence.         He    contends that the court should have\n\naccepted    his   new   evidence    because     it   undermines    the   factual\n\npredicate for the state court disbarment orders.                  The district\n\ncourt declined to convene such a hearing on the ground that, even\n\nif   it    accepted     the   new   evidence,    the    evidence    would   not\n\nsufficiently undermine the state court rulings to warrant relief.\n\n            Bailey's discipline proceeding was governed by Local Rule\n\n83.6(2)(D) which provides:\n\n            [The district court] shall impose the identical\n            discipline unless the respondent-attorney\n            demonstrates, or [the district court] finds,\n            that upon the face of the record upon which the\n            discipline    in   another   jurisdiction    is\n            predicated it clearly appears:\n\n            (i) that the proceeding was so lacking in\n            notice or opportunity to be heard as to\n            constitute a deprivation of due process; or\n            (ii) that there was such an infirmity of proof\n            establishing the misconduct as to give rise to\n            the clear conviction that [the district court]\n            could not, consistent with its duty, accept as\n            final the conclusion on the subject;\n            (iii) that the imposition of the same\n            discipline by this court would result in grave\n            injustice; or\n            (iv) that the misconduct established is deemed\n            by   [the    district    court]    to   warrant\n            substantially     different     discipline.\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fThis rule recognizes that \"disbarment by [a state] does not result\n\nin automatic disbarment by the federal court.\"               In re Ruffalo, 390\n\nU.S. 544, 547 (1968). But, in the interest of avoiding relitigation\n\nof   matter    previously   adjudicated     by    other   tribunals,     it   also\n\nprovides appropriate deference to the original state proceeding by\n\nlimiting federal court review to determining only that the state\n\nproceeding complied with due process, that there was adequate proof\n\nof misconduct, and that imposing reciprocal discipline would not\n\nresult in a grave injustice. See Theard v. United States, 354 U.S.\n\n278,   282    (1957).   Given   the    limited      nature    of   a   reciprocal\n\ndiscipline proceeding in federal court, \"there is no entitlement to\n\na de novo trial . . . .\"      Surrick, 338 F.3d at 232.\n\n              The Local Rule provides that a reciprocal discipline\n\nproceeding is based on \"the record upon which the discipline in\n\nanother jurisdiction is predicated.\"             Mass. L.R. 83.6(2)(D).        The\n\nRule does not explicitly provide for an evidentiary hearing.                    We\n\ntherefore agree with the district court that holding such a hearing\n\nin a reciprocal discipline matter would be \"extraordinary.\"                   In re\n\nBailey, No. 02-10093, 2005 WL 2901885, at *3 (D. Mass. Nov. 1,\n\n2005).   We review the district court's decision not to hold an\n\nevidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion.              Cf. United States\n\nv. Jimenez, 419 F.3d 34, 42 (1st Cir. 2005) (reviewing district's\n\norder declining to hold evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress\n\nfor an abuse of discretion); Bank One Texas, N.A. v. Montle, 964\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fF.2d 48, 51-52 (1st Cir. 1992) (reviewing district court's order\n\ndeclining to hold an evidentiary hearing on motion to dismiss for\n\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction for an abuse of discretion);\n\nUnited States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 1992) (reviewing\n\ndistrict court's denial of motion for an evidentiary hearing in\n\nsentencing proceeding for an abuse of discretion); Jackson v. Fair,\n\n846 F.2d 811, 819 (1st Cir. 1988) (reviewing district court's denial\n\nof   a       motion   to   hold   evidentiary   hearing   on   a   request   for   a\n\npreliminary injunction for a clear abuse of discretion).1\n\n                Summarized        succinctly,   the   evidence      that     Bailey\n\nmisappropriated client funds is as follows.               In 1994, Claude Duboc\n\nwas indicted by a federal grand jury for drug smuggling and money\n\nlaundering. Duboc earned hundreds of millions of dollars by running\n\ndrugs, and the government sought forfeiture of all of Duboc's drug\n\nproceeds as part of the prosecution.              Duboc's assets included two\n\nmansions in France.\n\n                Duboc hired Bailey to represent him in the criminal\n\nmatter.        Recognizing the strength of the government's case against\n\nhis client, Bailey pursued a strategy of pledging Duboc's utmost\n\ncooperation in forfeiting his assets in the hope that the court\n\nwould credit him at sentencing for his cooperation.                It soon became\n\napparent that there would be difficulty in forfeiting the French\n\n\n\n         2\n      Bailey argues for de novo review but cites no supporting\nauthority.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fmansions because the federal government could not undertake to\n\nmaintain the properties pending their sale.               To facilitate the\n\nforfeiture, Bailey volunteered to maintain the properties, arrange\n\nfor their sale, and turn the sale proceeds over to the government.\n\nTo   provide   Bailey    with   the   requisite   funds   to   maintain   the\n\nproperties and to establish a potential pool of money from which\n\nBailey could recover his fees, the prosecutors proposed that one of\n\nDuboc's cash accounts (which held approximately $3.5 million) be\n\nturned over to Bailey.\n\n           Simultaneously, questions arose over the forfeiture of\n\n602,000 shares of stock that Duboc owned in a company called Biochem\n\nPharma (Biochem).       At the time, Biochem was involved in promising\n\ndrug research that could result in the stock increasing in value.\n\nBut there was concern that the immediate liquidation of Duboc's\n\nsubstantial holdings of the company could depress its value.               To\n\navoid this problem, Bailey and the prosecutors agreed that, instead\n\nof the cash account, the Biochem stock would be transferred to\n\nBailey to pay for the upkeep of the mansions and to provide a source\n\nfrom which he could draw fees.         It was also understood, however,\n\nthat Bailey would not be entitled to fees without approval from the\n\ncourt and that Bailey bore the risk that the Biochem stock would\n\ndecrease in value, which, if it occurred, would deprive Bailey of\n\nassets to maintain the mansions or to collect his fees.           In accord\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fwith these understandings, the Biochem stock (then valued at about\n\n$6 million) was transferred to Bailey's Swiss bank account.\n\n           Approximately a week after the transfer, Bailey borrowed\n\nover $4 million against the Biochem shares.    He then proceeded to\n\ntransfer all but $350,000 from that account to his personal checking\n\naccount.   He used these proceeds to spend over $2.2 million on his\n\nprivate businesses and personal expenses.   This commingling of the\n\nBiochem stock proceeds with his personal assets was the basis for\n\nthe finding that Bailey misappropriated client funds.\n\n           Bailey contends that his deal with the government allowed\n\nhim to keep the value of the stock's appreciation that occurred\n\nafter the date of transfer, and therefore he was responsible only\n\nto maintain the initial $6 million value of the stock.2       Bailey\n\nargues that he could introduce evidence that the stock was not given\n\nto him to hold in \"formal trust,\" which he claims would support his\n\nargument that he owned the appreciated value of the Biochem stock\n\nin fee simple absolute.\n\n           The record contains documentary evidence to support the\n\nconclusion that Bailey was not entitled to the personal use of the\n\nstock on the date of the transfer.    Most damaging to Bailey is his\n\nacknowledgment that he was only entitled to fees that were approved\n\nby the court.    When a dispute arose between Bailey and his co-\n\n\n\n     2\n      Two years after the transfer, the stock had increased in\nvalue by $4 million.\n\n                                -7-\n\fcounsel, Bailey wrote to co-counsel, \"I could have at this point\n\nrejected the silly conditions offered by [co-counsel] and applied\n\nfor a healthy fee to [the court] and turned the balance of the\n\nBiochem stock back to the Government.\"        He also told Duboc that he,\n\nBailey, \"would be paid with [the court's] approval only that amount\n\nwhich is commensurate with the result achieved in your case, and the\n\namount of the work that went into it.\"           Even subsequent to the\n\ncriminal proceedings, Bailey continued to acknowledge that the\n\ndistrict court had \"the final say on fees.\" Yet the evidence is\n\nundisputed that Bailey took possession of the stock as his personal\n\nproperty well in advance of any fee award by the court and that he\n\nnever told anyone that he was entitled to the appreciated value of\n\nthe stock in addition to the judicially-approved fees.\n\n          As   mentioned   above,    Bailey    seeks   to   undermine   this\n\nevidence of misappropriation by presenting proof that there was no\n\n\"formal trust\" for his possession of the stock.3 But, even assuming\n\nthat Bailey could prove that the stock was not transferred to him\n\nin trust, such proof would not adequately undermine the states'\n\nrationale for disbarment.     The district court declined to hold a\n\nhearing to consider Bailey's new evidence because it correctly\n\n\n     3\n      Bailey says that he could produce testimony from government\nattorneys involved in the Duboc prosecution that the word \"trust\"\nwas not used in arranging the stock transfer and that the Internal\nRevenue Service has since characterized the stock as \"income\" on\nthe date of the transfer which, Bailey argues, is inconsistent with\na finding that the stock was held in trust.\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\frecognized that neither the Florida nor Massachusetts decisions\n\n\"hinged on the creation of a formal trust.\"                   Bailey, 2005 WL\n\n2901855, at *3; see also Bailey, 786 N.E2d at 347-48; Bailey, 803\n\nSo.3d at 692.       Instead, these decisions were predicated on the\n\ndetermination that \"Bailey had no reasonable basis to believe that\n\nhe could draw the value of the shares to pay attorneys fees as the\n\ncase went on without prior court approval.\"             Id.; see also Bailey,\n\n786   N.E.2d   at   348    n.17   (rejecting     Bailey's     request    for    an\n\nevidentiary hearing on similar basis).                Given that the evidence\n\nprovides a sound basis for concluding that Bailey used the stock\n\nproceeds for personal use without the required court approval, the\n\ndistrict court was within its discretion in concluding that no\n\nevidentiary hearing was necessary because the new evidence would not\n\nestablish   such    an    \"infirmity   of    proof\"    that   relief    would   be\n\navailable under Local Rule 83.6(2)(D).4\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n      Bailey's argument that he owned the appreciated value of the\nstock is also inconsistent with his actual dealings with the stock.\nBailey acknowledges that, in the initial months after he received\nthe stock, its value did not increase. \"If the understanding had\nbeen that any appreciation in value was Bailey's own money, that\nwould mean that Bailey could not withdraw any proceeds for himself\nuntil at least such time as some appreciation occurred.\" Bailey,\n786 N.E.2d at 347.     Yet, \"from the day the Biochem stock was\ntransferred to him, Bailey treated the money as his own.\" Id.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f",

In 1994, Claude Duboc was indicted by a federal grand jury for drug smuggling and money laundering. Duboc earned hundreds of millions of dollars by running drugs, and the government sought forfeiture of all of Duboc's drug proceeds as part of the prosecution. Duboc's assets included two mansions in France.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Duboc hired Bailey to represent him in the criminal matter. Recognizing the strength of the government's case against his client, Bailey pursued a strategy of pledging Duboc's utmost cooperation in forfeiting his assets in the hope that the court would credit him at sentencing for his cooperation. It soon became apparent that there would be difficulty in forfeiting the French mansions because the federal government could not undertake to maintain the properties pending their sale. To facilitate the forfeiture, Bailey volunteered to maintain the properties, arrange for their sale, and turn the sale proceeds over to the government. To provide Bailey with the requisite funds to maintain the properties and to establish a potential pool of money from which Bailey could recover his fees, the prosecutors proposed that one of Duboc's cash accounts (which held approximately $3.5 million) be turned over to Bailey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simultaneously, questions arose over the forfeiture of 602,000 shares of stock that Duboc owned in a company called Biochem Pharma (Biochem). At the time, Biochem was involved in promising drug research that could result in the stock increasing in value. But there was concern that the immediate liquidation of Duboc's substantial holdings of the company could depress its value. To avoid this problem, Bailey and the prosecutors agreed that, instead of the cash account, the Biochem stock would be transferred to Bailey to pay for the upkeep of the mansions and to provide a source from which he could draw fees. It was also understood, however, that Bailey would not be entitled to fees without approval from the court and that Bailey bore the risk that the Biochem stock would decrease in value, which, if it occurred, would deprive Bailey of assets to maintain the mansions or to collect his fees. In accord with these understandings, the Biochem stock (then valued at about $6 million) was transferred to Bailey's Swiss bank account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately a week after the transfer, Bailey borrowed over $4 million against the Biochem shares. He then proceeded to transfer all but $350,000 from that account to his personal checking account. He used these proceeds to spend over $2.2 million on his private businesses and personal expenses. This commingling of the Biochem stock proceeds with his personal assets was the basis for the finding that Bailey misappropriated client funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey contends that his deal with the government allowed him to keep the value of the stock's appreciation that occurred after the date of transfer, and therefore he was responsible only to maintain the initial $6 million value of the stock.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Bailey argues that he could introduce evidence that the stock was not given to him to hold in \"formal trust,\" which he claims would support his argument that he owned the appreciated value of the Biochem stock in fee simple absolute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record contains documentary evidence to support the conclusion that Bailey was not entitled to the personal use of the stock on the date of the transfer. Most damaging to Bailey is his acknowledgment that he was only entitled to fees that were approved by the court. When a dispute arose between Bailey and his co-counsel, Bailey wrote to co-counsel, \"I could have at this point rejected the silly conditions offered by [co-counsel] and applied for a healthy fee to [the court] and turned the balance of the Biochem stock back to the Government.\" He also told Duboc that he, Bailey, \"would be paid with [the court's] approval only that amount which is commensurate with the result achieved in your case, and the amount of the work that went into it.\" Even subsequent to the criminal proceedings, Bailey continued to acknowledge that the district court had \"the final say on fees.\" Yet the evidence is undisputed that Bailey took possession of the stock as his personal property well in advance of any fee award by the court and that he never told anyone that he was entitled to the appreciated value of the stock in addition to the judicially-approved fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As mentioned above, Bailey seeks to undermine this evidence of misappropriation by presenting proof that there was no \"formal trust\" for his possession of the stock.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> But, even assuming that Bailey could prove that the stock was not transferred to him in trust, such proof would not adequately undermine the states' rationale for disbarment. The district court declined to hold a hearing to consider Bailey's new evidence because it correctly recognized that neither the Florida nor Massachusetts decisions \"hinged on the creation of a formal trust.\" <i>Bailey,</i> 2005 WL 2901855, at *3; <i>see also Bailey,</i> 786 N.E.2d at 347-48; <i>Bailey,</i> 803 So.2d at 692. Instead, these decisions were predicated on the determination that \"Bailey had no reasonable basis to believe that he could draw the value of the shares to pay attorneys fees as the case went on without prior court approval.\" <i>Id.; see also Bailey,</i> 786 N.E.2d at 348 n. 17 (rejecting Bailey's request for an evidentiary hearing on similar basis). Given that the evidence provides a sound basis for concluding that Bailey used the stock proceeds for personal use without the required court approval, the district court was within its discretion in concluding that no evidentiary hearing was necessary because the new evidence would not establish such an \"infirmity of proof\" that relief would be available under Local Rule 83.6(2)(D).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Bailey argues for de novo review but cites no supporting authority</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Two years after the transfer, the stock had increased in value by $4 million</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Bailey says that he could produce testimony from government attorneys involved in the Duboc prosecution that the word \"trust\" was not used in arranging the stock transfer and that the Internal Revenue Service has since characterized the stock as \"income\" on the date of the transfer which, Bailey argues, is inconsistent with a finding that the stock was held in trust</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Bailey's argument that he owned the appreciated value of the stock is also inconsistent with his actual dealings with the stock.

An attorney discipline proceeding under a reciprocal discipline rule is a case or controversy under Article III. <i>See In re Calvo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"71031\"><a href=\"/opinion/71031/calvo-william-a-iii-in-re/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></a></span>, 965-66 (11th Cir.1996); <i>In re Palmisano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"708087\"><a href=\"/opinion/708087/in-the-matter-of-michael-palmisano/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, 484-85 (7th Cir. 1995). Moreover, a district court's decision disbarring an attorney from practice is a final judgment as it \"ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\" <i>Catlin v.

But, in the interest of avoiding relitigation of matter previously adjudicated by other tribunals, it also provides appropriate deference to the original state proceeding by limiting federal court review to determining only that the state proceeding complied with due process, that there was adequate proof of misconduct, and that imposing reciprocal discipline would not result in a grave injustice. <i>See Theard v.

Instead, these decisions were predicated on the determination that \"Bailey had no reasonable basis to believe that he could draw the value of the shares to pay attorneys fees as the case went on without prior court approval.\" <i>Id.; see also Bailey,</i> 786 N.E.2d at 348 n. 17 (rejecting Bailey's request for an evidentiary hearing on similar basis). Given that the evidence provides a sound basis for concluding that Bailey used the stock proceeds for personal use without the required court approval, the district court was within its discretion in concluding that no evidentiary hearing was necessary because the new evidence would not establish such an \"infirmity of proof\" that relief would be available under Local Rule 83.6(2)(D).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Bailey argues for de novo review but cites no supporting authority</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Two years after the transfer, the stock had increased in value by $4 million</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Bailey says that he could produce testimony from government attorneys involved in the Duboc prosecution that the word \"trust\" was not used in arranging the stock transfer and that the Internal Revenue Service has since characterized the stock as \"income\" on the date of the transfer which, Bailey argues, is inconsistent with a finding that the stock was held in trust</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Bailey's argument that he owned the appreciated value of the stock is also inconsistent with his actual dealings with the stock. Bailey acknowledges that, in the initial months after he received the stock, its value did not increase. \"If the understanding had been that any appreciation in value was Bailey's own money, that would mean that Bailey could not withdraw any proceeds for himself until at least such time as some appreciation occurred.\"<i>Bailey,</i> 786 N.E.2d at 347. Yet, \"from the day the Biochem stock was transferred to him, Bailey treated the money as his own.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
