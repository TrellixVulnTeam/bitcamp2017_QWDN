GUADALUPE-RIVERA,\n\n                       Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n         [Hon. Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n              Lynch, Lipez, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Laura Maldonado Rodríguez for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nRosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney, and Mariana E.\nBauzá-Almonte, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          August 30, 2007\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.             Appellant Luis Guadalupe-Rivera\n\n(\"Guadalupe\") pled guilty to charges involving drug distribution\n\nand firearm violations. He now challenges his sentence, contending\n\nthat (1) the district court abused its discretion in refusing to\n\nconduct an evidentiary hearing on whether certain prior convictions\n\non which the court based his sentence were actually part of the\n\ninstant   offense;   and   (2)    the    court    erred   in   relying   on   his\n\nconfidential juvenile record without disclosing the content of that\n\nrecord to him, in violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 32.\n\nAs to the former, we find no abuse of discretion; as to the latter,\n\nthe   court's   error   was      harmless.         Consequently,    we   affirm\n\nGuadalupe's sentence.\n\n                                        I.\n\n           On July 17, 2003, a grand jury returned a superseding\n\nindictment charging Guadalupe and twenty-six other individuals with\n\nvarious violations relating to a drug distribution network.                   The\n\ncounts involving Guadalupe alleged conspiracy to possess with\n\nintent to distribute and distribution of controlled substances near\n\na school or public housing project, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841, 846, and 860 (Count One); conspiracy to use, carry or possess\n\nfirearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), (o) (Count Two); and\n\npossession of a firearm in a school zone, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 2 and 922(q)(2) (Count Three).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f             Guadalupe pled guilty to Counts One and Two.               As part of\n\nthe   plea   agreement,     the   parties     stipulated    to    the    following\n\nunderlying facts:\n\n             From on or about June, 2001, and continuing up\n             to March 13, 2003, the defendant . . . did\n             agree with others to possess controlled\n             substances   at   various  drug   distribution\n             locations operating within the Nemesio R.\n             Canales Public Housing Project . . . .      In\n             particular, the defendant was a manager of a\n             cocaine base (\"crack\") drug point, a runner,\n             and a shift supervisor at the Nemesio R.\n             Canales Public Housing Project.\n             . . .\n             From   on  or   about   September   12,  2001,\n             continuing up to March 13, 2003, [the\n             defendant] did knowingly, intentionally, and\n             unlawfully conspire and agree with diverse\n             other persons to possess, use, brandish, or\n             carry a shotgun, a .357 revolver, a .9mm\n             pistol, and an AR-15 semi-automatic assault\n             rifle, in furtherance of the drug-trafficking\n             conspiracy mentioned above.\n\nThe plea agreement explicitly stated that there was no stipulation\n\nas    to   his   criminal   history    category.         With    respect    to    the\n\nsentencing       recommendation,      the    agreement     explained       that    if\n\nGuadalupe’s      criminal   history     category    was     II    or    less,     the\n\ngovernment would recommend a sentence of 168 months' imprisonment;\n\notherwise, the sentencing recommendation would be the lower end of\n\nthe applicable Sentencing Guidelines range.\n\n             The Presentence Report (“PSR”) stated that Guadalupe's\n\nprior convictions yielded eight criminal history points: three\n\npoints for a 1998 conviction involving weapons violations, violence\n\nagainst public authority, and aggravated battery; two points for a\n\n                                       -3-\n\f1999 conviction for weapons violations; two points for a 2002\n\nconviction      for   possession     of   marijuana;     and    one    point   for    a\n\njuvenile   offense,        the   record   of    which   the    court   received      on\n\ncondition of confidentiality.1              The PSR also added two criminal\n\nhistory points because Guadalupe was on probation at the time he\n\ncommitted the instant offenses, see U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d), and two\n\nmore points because he committed the instant offenses less than two\n\nyears after release from imprisonment, see U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(e).\n\nThus, Guadalupe's record yielded a total of twelve criminal history\n\npoints, resulting in a criminal history category of V.                     Based on\n\nthis criminal history category and a total offense level of thirty-\n\nfour, the PSR stated that the applicable Sentencing Guidelines\n\nrange was 235 to 293 months' imprisonment.\n\n            During     a    change   of   plea      hearing    in   November   2004,\n\nGuadalupe objected to the dates of the firearms conspiracy alleged\n\nin the indictment, arguing that the conspiracy began earlier than\n\nSeptember 2001.        He subsequently filed an objection to the PSR,\n\narguing that his two prior convictions for possession of weapons in\n\n1998 and 1999 were \"a result of his involvement in the conspiracy.\"\n\nThus, he contended, those convictions should not count as separate\n\noffenses in his criminal history.               He asked the district court to\n\nconduct    an   evidentiary       hearing      to   obtain    testimony   from    two\n\n\n     1\n       The Puerto Rico Rules of Procedure for Minors' Matters, P.R.\nLaws Ann. tit. 34, § 2237(d), require that juvenile records be kept\nconfidential subject to certain limited exceptions.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fcooperating government witnesses, Edna Diaz Pastrana and Leonor\n\nCuadrado Figueroa, claiming that they would verify that the prior\n\nconvictions were part of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment.\n\nHe attached copies of notes in Spanish taken during law enforcement\n\ninterviews with the witnesses, asserting that these notes supported\n\nhis claim.\n\n               At the sentencing hearing on May 16, 2005, defense\n\ncounsel renewed the objection to counting the weapons convictions\n\nin    Guadalupe's     criminal       history   and    again    alleged   that    the\n\ntestimony of the two government witnesses would establish that the\n\nconspiracy began prior to the dates specified in the indictment.\n\nThe    court    declined   to    hold    an    evidentiary     hearing   for    such\n\ntestimony, and counted the convictions toward the criminal history.\n\nAlso at the sentencing hearing, defense counsel objected to the\n\ncourt's      consideration      of     confidential        information   regarding\n\nGuadalupe's juvenile history, asserting that she should have access\n\nto the information if the court intended to rely on it.                  However,\n\nthe court stated that \"I don't think it would change anything,\"\n\nand included the juvenile history in its sentencing calculation.\n\nFinally, Guadalupe contended that the 2002 marijuana conviction was\n\npart    of     the   instant    conspiracy.          The    court   accepted    that\n\ncontention.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f           With    the   marijuana   conviction      excluded,   Guadalupe's\n\ncriminal history category was reduced to IV,2 yielding a Sentencing\n\nGuidelines range of 210 to 262 months' imprisonment.                  The court\n\nthen sentenced Guadalupe to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 222\n\nmonths on each count.       Guadalupe appeals, contending that (1) the\n\ndistrict   court   abused    its   discretion   in   refusing    to    hold   an\n\nevidentiary hearing for the testimony of the government witnesses;\n\nand (2) the district court erred in considering confidential\n\ninformation from his juvenile record without disclosure of that\n\ninformation to him and his counsel.3\n\n                                     II.\n\nA. Evidentiary Hearing\n\n           The Sentencing Guidelines instruct courts to determine an\n\noffender's criminal history category by adding a specified number\n\nof points \"for each prior sentence of imprisonment,\" U.S.S.G. §\n\n4A1.1; the length of the prior sentence determines the number of\n\n\n\n     2\n       The two points added for the marijuana conviction were\nremoved, as well as the two points added under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(e)\nbecause the instant offense had occurred less than two years after\nGuadalupe was released after serving his term of imprisonment for\nthe marijuana conviction. The changes left eight criminal history\npoints, with a resulting criminal history category of IV.\n     3\n        Guadalupe's plea agreement also contained a provision\nwaiving his right to appeal. Although the government argued the\nwaiver issue in its opening brief, it conceded at oral argument and\nconfirmed in an \"Informative Motion\" submitted the following day\nthat the waiver of appeal language in the plea agreement did not\nconform to the understanding of the parties. For that reason, the\ngovernment withdrew its waiver of appeal argument.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fpoints added.     The Sentencing Guidelines further define a prior\n\nsentence as \"a sentence imposed prior to sentencing on the instant\n\noffense, other than a sentence for conduct that is part of the\n\ninstant offense.\"    U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2 cmt. n.1 (emphasis added).          In\n\nlight of this provision, Guadalupe argues that the conduct leading\n\nto his 1998 and 1999 weapons convictions was part of the conduct\n\ncomprising the instant conspiracy and should not have been included\n\nin his criminal history calculation.\n\n            Guadalupe contends that the district court should have\n\nheld   an   evidentiary   hearing     to   consider    the   testimony   of\n\ncooperating government witnesses Diaz and Cuadrado, who he claims\n\nwould testify that his weapons violations in 1998 and 1999 were\n\npart of the instant conspiracy.      The inclusion of the 1998 and 1999\n\nweapons     convictions   made   a    substantial     difference   in    the\n\ncalculation of Guadalupe's criminal history.            Without those two\n\noffenses, Guadalupe would have had only three criminal history\n\npoints, rather than the eight that the district court included in\n\nits calculation.     This would have resulted in a criminal history\n\ncategory of II, and pursuant to the plea agreement, the government\n\nwould have recommended a sentence of only 168 months rather than\n\nthe 222 months that the court imposed. Before the district court,\n\nGuadalupe made this assertion in his objection to the PSR and\n\nattached Spanish language notes from law enforcement interviews\n\nwith these witnesses.     We review the district court's decision to\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fdeny an evidentiary hearing at sentencing for abuse of discretion.\n\nSee United States v. McAndrews, 12 F.3d 273, 279 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n               There may be circumstances in which a court should hear\n\nevidence regarding a prior conviction to determine whether the\n\nconduct underlying that conviction is part of the instant offense.\n\nHowever, under the circumstances present here, we cannot conclude\n\nthat the district court abused its discretion in refusing to hear\n\ntestimony from Diaz and Cuadrado. Guadalupe offered no evidence to\n\nindicate       that    these     witnesses   would   testify   that   his   prior\n\nconvictions were part of the instant conspiracy.4                     His motion\n\nobjecting to the PSR contained the bare allegation that these\n\nwitnesses would testify that the conspiracy began before the 2001\n\ndate       alleged    in   the   indictment.    At   the   sentencing   hearing,\n\nGuadalupe's counsel argued that the \"indictment doesn't control the\n\nscope\" of the conspiracy and stated that Guadalupe would testify\n\nthat he entered the conspiracy in February 1998.               However, counsel\n\ndid not even mention Cuadrado by name at the hearing, and mentioned\n\n\n\n       4\n      As noted, the law enforcement interview notes that Guadalupe\nattached to his objection to the PSR were in Spanish and were\nunaccompanied by English translations.      Federal litigation in\nPuerto Rico must be conducted in English, 48 U.S.C. § 864, and,\n\"[w]hen a district court accepts foreign-language documents without\nthe required English translations, an appellate court cannot\nconsider the untranslated documents on appeal.\"          Dávila v.\nCorporacion de P.R. para la Difusion Publica, ___ F.3d ___, 2007 WL\n2253531, at *2 (1st Cir. Aug. 7, 2007); Fed. R. App. P. 10. Thus,\neven though the government submitted translations of the notes on\nappeal, we cannot consider them. Guadalupe offers no explanation\nfor his omission of translations before the district court.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fDiaz only to state that she would testify that Guadalupe's 2002\n\nmarijuana conviction was part of the instant conspiracy.\n\n          In short, there was no evidence to support counsel's bare\n\nallegations that testimony from Diaz and Cuadrado would reveal that\n\nGuadalupe's prior weapons convictions stemmed from conduct that was\n\npart of the instant conspiracy.          Thus, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in declining to hold an\n\nevidentiary hearing.\n\nB. Juvenile Record\n\n          Guadalupe also argues that the district court improperly\n\nrelied on his confidential juvenile record in sentencing him\n\nwithout sufficiently disclosing the content of that record to him,\n\nin violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.      We review\n\nde novo a district court's compliance with Rule 32.        See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Baldrich, 471 F.3d 1110, 1112 (9th Cir. 2006).    If\n\nan error occurred, we will remand for resentencing if that error\n\nwas not harmless.    See, e.g., United States v. Hamad, ___ F.3d ___;\n\n2007 WL 2049867, at *9 (6th Cir. July 19, 2007) (applying harmless\n\nerror review after finding a violation of Rule 32).\n\n          A federal court may consider an offender's juvenile\n\nrecord in determining a sentence.       See United States v. Gonzalez-\n\nArimont, 268 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 2001). The Sentencing Guidelines\n\nprovide, inter alia, that the sentencing court should\n\n          (A) add 2 points . . . for each adult or\n          juvenile sentence to confinement of at least\n\n                                  -9-\n\f          sixty days if the defendant was released from\n          such confinement within five years of his\n          commencement of the instant offense;\n\n          (B) add 1 point . . . for each adult or\n          juvenile sentence imposed within five years of\n          the defendant's commencement of the instant\n          offense not covered in (A).\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(d)(2). Thus, it was proper for the district court\n\nto include Guadalupe's juvenile record in its criminal history\n\ncalculation.\n\n          Under the Puerto Rico Rules of Procedure for Minors'\n\nMatters, however, juvenile records must be sealed, and access to\n\nthem is strictly limited.    See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 34, § 2237(d).\n\nSuch confidential information, if used in federal sentencing, is\n\nsubject to certain procedural requirements.          Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 32 states that a PSR \"must exclude . . . any\n\nsources of information obtained upon a promise of confidentiality.\"\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 32(d)(3).     However, Rule 32 also states that at\n\nsentencing the court \"must give to the defendant and an attorney\n\nfor the government a written summary of — or summarize in camera —\n\nany information excluded from the presentence report under Rule\n\n32(d)(3) on which the court will rely in sentencing, and give them\n\na reasonable opportunity to comment on that information.\"       Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 32(i)(1)(B).\n\n          Regarding     Guadalupe's   juvenile   conviction,   the   PSR\n\nstated, in full:\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f            The Court has received information regarding\n            this defendant's prior juvenile record under\n            the promise of confidentiality and non-\n            disclosure pursuant to a local court order.\n            As such, complete disclosure of the subject\n            information,     which    under     [sections\n            4A1.2(d)(2)(B) and (a)(2) of the Sentencing\n            Guidelines] affects the computation of his\n            criminal history category is withheld.\n\nThen, at the sentencing hearing, the district court stated that it\n\n\"has     received    information      that      is     confidential    about       this\n\ndefendant's prior criminal record . . . .                     This will also be\n\nconsidered.\"      Guadalupe's counsel objected, stating: \"I am counsel\n\nand I should have that information available . . . .                        If you're\n\ngoing to consider it, we should have an opportunity to examine it\n\nor rebut it.\"       The court responded: \"I don't think it would change\n\nanything, counsel.         It says that -- it was two counts of violation\n\nof the weapons law.         So that's it.       And this will go on the record.\n\nSo I will consider that in my sentencing.\"\n\n            On appeal, the government contends, as a preliminary\n\nmatter, that Guadalupe did not preserve his challenge to the\n\ndistrict court's reliance on the confidential information.                           It\n\nargues that, although defense counsel objected at sentencing to the\n\ndistrict court's failure to disclose the details of Guadalupe's\n\njuvenile record to her, she did not object to the one point that\n\nwas    assessed     for    Guadalupe's     juvenile      record,    either    in    his\n\nobjection to the PSR or at sentencing.                 We need not resolve this\n\nissue,    however,        because   even   if    the    challenge     was    properly\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fpreserved, the court's error in not disclosing the content of\n\nGuadalupe's juvenile record was harmless.\n\n           The Supreme Court has explained that the purpose of Rule\n\n32 is to ensure \"focused, adversarial development of the factual\n\nand legal issues relevant to determining the appropriate Guidelines\n\nsentence.\"    Burns v. United States, 501 U.S. 129, 134 (1991).        It\n\nis essential to this adversarial process that the court provide the\n\ndefendant with all information related to his sentence on which the\n\ncourt   intends   to   rely   so   that   the   defendant   has   adequate\n\nopportunity to contest any inaccuracies or present other relevant\n\nfactors.     See, e.g., Baldrich, 471 F.3d at 1114 (explaining that\n\nRule 32 requires that \"all facts relevant to the defendant's\n\nsentence be provided to the defendant for adversarial testing\");\n\nUnited States v. Pabon-Cruz, 321 F. Supp. 2d 570, 573 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n2003)(\"[T]he process of disclosure, comment, and judicial ruling\n\nprovided by Rules 32(e)-(i) is more than adequate to address any\n\ninaccuracy in the PSR. . . .        Rule 32 specifically requires the\n\nCourt to disclose to the defendant any information that the Court\n\nwill rely on that is not in the PSR . . . .\").                Given this\n\nunderlying policy rationale, the initial question in determining\n\ncompliance with Rule 32 is whether the court has provided the\n\ndefendant with enough information to allow the defendant to have a\n\n\"reasonable opportunity to comment\" on that information.          Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 32(i)(1)(B).\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f           Ensuring a \"reasonable opportunity to comment\" requires\n\nthe court to give more information to defense counsel than the\n\ncursory statement the district court provided here, which merely\n\ninformed counsel that Guadalupe's juvenile record involved two\n\ncounts of violations of the weapons laws.   See, e.g., Hamad, 2007\n\nWL 2049867, at *8 (\"Because the summary did not refer to any\n\nspecific incident or name its source(s), it did not give [the\n\ndefendant] a 'reasonable opportunity' to rebut the information or\n\notherwise question its accuracy.\"). Puerto Rico law indicates that\n\na defendant may have access to the confidential information on\n\nwhich the district court relied in this case, see P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 34, § 2237(d), and federal law makes clear that the court\n\nshould provide that information to the defendant, see Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 32(i)(1)(B).5   Moreover, given that the primary purpose of the\n\nPuerto Rico Rules of Procedure for Minors' Matters is to protect\n\nthe privacy of juvenile offenders, there was no pragmatic reason\n\nfor the court to withhold Guadalupe's records from him and his\n\ncounsel.   In light of these statutory provisions and the policy\n\n\n\n     5\n       The government's argument that Guadalupe's counsel should\nhave obtained the juvenile records herself is unavailing.       The\nRules of Procedure for Minors’ Matters do provide that juvenile\nrecords \"will be accessible for inspection by the minor's legal\ncounsel after being duly identified and in the place designated for\nit.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 34, § 2237(d). However, Rule 32 requires\nthat the court provide the defendant with a written summary of the\nconfidential information before it, and there is no exception to\nthis requirement simply because the defendant may have alternative\navenues of obtaining the confidential information.\n\n                               -13-\n\funderlying them, the district court erred in failing to give\n\nGuadalupe a summary of the information contained in his juvenile\n\nrecord.\n\n               Despite this error, the court's partial disclosure, under\n\nthe circumstances of this case, was harmless because Guadalupe\n\nstill    had    a    sufficient     basis   for   disputing   the   violations.\n\nGuadalupe's submissions indicate that he in fact had substantial\n\nfamiliarity      with   his   own    criminal     history.    His   reply   brief\n\nacknowledges that he and his attorney \"were aware of his juvenile\n\ncriminal record to some extent\" and that \"his actions as a juvenile\n\nwere encompassed in the conspiracy for which he was found guilty.\"\n\nGuadalupe thus knew enough about his juvenile history to argue to\n\nthe district court that this history should not be included as a\n\nseparate offense in his sentencing.                In light of this conceded\n\nknowledge, we see no reason to believe that the court's failure to\n\noffer a full explanation of Guadalupe's juvenile record impaired\n\nhis ability to contest the court's reliance on that record in its\n\nsentencing.         See Hamad, 2007 WL 2049867, at **9-10.            Thus, the\n\ndistrict court's failure to disclose this information to Guadalupe\n\nwas harmless.6\n\n\n     6\n       The government also argues that any error was harmless\nbecause even if Guadalupe's juvenile conviction was removed from\nthe criminal history calculation, he would still have seven\ncriminal history points, which would still result in a criminal\nhistory category of IV. Thus, there would be no difference in the\napplicable sentencing range. However, having resolved the harmless\nerror question on other grounds, we need not address this alternate\n\n                                        -14-\n\f                                      III.\n\n            We conclude that the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in declining to hold an evidentiary hearing for the\n\ntestimony of cooperating government witnesses regarding the date of\n\ninception    of   the   conspiracy.      We   further   conclude   that   the\n\ndeficiency in the information the court disclosed to Guadalupe and\n\nhis counsel regarding his juvenile record was harmless error.\n\nThus, we affirm Guadalupe's sentence.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\nrationale.\n\n                                      -15-\n\f",

He now challenges his sentence, contending that (1) the district court abused its discretion in refusing to conduct an evidentiary hearing on whether certain prior convictions on which the court based his sentence were actually part of the instant offense; and (2) the court erred in relying on his confidential juvenile record without disclosing the content of that record to him, in violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 32. As to the former, we find no abuse of discretion; as to the latter, the court's error was harmless. Consequently, we affirm Guadalupe's sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>On July 17, 2003, a grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging Guadalupe and twenty-six other individuals with various violations relating to a drug distribution network. The counts involving Guadalupe alleged conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of controlled substances near a school or public housing project, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841, 846, and 860 (Count One); conspiracy to use, carry or possess firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), (<i>o</i>) (Count Two); and possession of a firearm in a school zone, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 922(q)(2) (Count Three).</p>\n<p>Guadalupe pled guilty to Counts One and Two. As part of the plea agreement, the parties stipulated to the following underlying facts:</p>\n<blockquote>From on or about June, 2001, and continuing up to March 13, 2003, the defendant . . . did agree with others to possess controlled substances at various drug distribution locations operating within the Nemesio R. Canales Public Housing Project. . . . In particular, the defendant was a manager of a cocaine base (\"crack\") drug point, a runner, and a shift supervisor at the Nemesio R. Canales Public Housing Project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>From on or about September 12, 2001, continuing up to March 13, 2003, [the defendant] did knowingly, intentionally, and unlawfully conspire and agree with diverse other persons to possess, use, brandish, or carry a shotgun, a .357 revolver, a .9mm pistol, and an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle, in furtherance of the drug-trafficking conspiracy mentioned above.</blockquote>\n<p>The plea agreement explicitly stated that there was no stipulation as to his criminal history category. With respect to the sentencing recommendation, the agreement explained that if Guadalupe's criminal history category was II or less, the government would recommend a sentence of 168 months' imprisonment; otherwise, the sentencing recommendation would be the lower end of the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range.</p>\n<p>The Presentence Report (\"PSR\") stated that Guadalupe's prior convictions yielded eight criminal history points: three points for a 1998 conviction involving weapons violations, violence against public authority, and aggravated battery; two points for a 1999 conviction for weapons violations; two points for a 2002 conviction for possession of marijuana; and one point for a juvenile offense, the record of which the court received on condition of confidentiality.<sup>[1]</sup> The PSR also added two criminal history points because Guadalupe was on probation at the time he committed the instant offenses, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d), and two more points because he committed the instant offenses less than two years after release from imprisonment, <i>see</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(e). Thus, Guadalupe's record yielded a total of twelve criminal history points, resulting in a criminal history category of V. Based on this criminal history category and a total offense level of thirty-four, the PSR stated that the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range was 235 to 293 months' imprisonment.</p>\n<p>During a change of plea hearing in November 2004, Guadalupe objected to the dates of the firearms conspiracy alleged in the indictment, arguing that the conspiracy began earlier than September 2001. He subsequently filed an objection to the PSR, arguing that his two prior convictions for possession of weapons in 1998 and 1999 were \"a result of his involvement in the conspiracy.\" Thus, he contended, those convictions should not count as separate offenses in his criminal history. He asked the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to obtain testimony from two cooperating government witnesses, Edna Diaz Pastrana and Leonor Cuadrado Figueroa, claiming that they would verify that the prior convictions were part of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment. He attached copies of notes in Spanish taken during law enforcement interviews with the witnesses, asserting that these notes supported his claim.</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing on May 16, 2005, defense counsel renewed the objection to counting the weapons convictions in Guadalupe's criminal history and again alleged that the testimony of the two government witnesses would establish that the conspiracy began prior to the dates specified in the indictment. The court declined to hold an evidentiary hearing for such testimony, and counted the convictions toward the criminal history. Also at the sentencing hearing, defense counsel objected to the court's consideration of confidential information regarding Guadalupe's juvenile history, asserting that she should have access to the information if the court intended to rely on it. However, the court stated that \"I don't think it would change anything,\" and included the juvenile history in its sentencing calculation. Finally, Guadalupe contended that the 2002 marijuana conviction was part of the instant conspiracy. The court accepted that contention.</p>\n<p>With the marijuana conviction excluded, Guadalupe's criminal history category was reduced to IV,<sup>[2]</sup> yielding a Sentencing Guidelines range of 210 to 262 months' imprisonment. The court then sentenced Guadalupe to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 222 months on each count. Guadalupe appeals, contending that (1) the district court abused its discretion in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing for the testimony of the government witnesses; and (2) the district court erred in considering confidential information from his juvenile record without disclosure of that information to him and his counsel.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>A. Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n<p>The Sentencing Guidelines instruct courts to determine an offender's criminal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> history category by adding a specified number of points \"for each prior sentence of imprisonment,\" U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1; the length of the prior sentence determines the number of points added. The Sentencing Guidelines further define a prior sentence as \"a sentence imposed prior to sentencing on the instant offense, <i>other than a sentence for conduct that is part of the instant offense.</i>\" U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2 cmt. n. 1 (emphasis added). In light of this provision, Guadalupe argues that the conduct leading to his 1998 and 1999 weapons convictions was part of the conduct comprising the instant conspiracy and should not have been included in his criminal history calculation.</p>\n<p>Guadalupe contends that the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing to consider the testimony of cooperating government witnesses Diaz and Cuadrado, who he claims would testify that his weapons violations in 1998 and 1999 were part of the instant conspiracy. The inclusion of the 1998 and 1999 weapons convictions made a substantial difference in the calculation of Guadalupe's criminal history. Without those two offenses, Guadalupe would have had only three criminal history points, rather than the eight that the district court included in its calculation. This would have resulted in a criminal history category of II, and pursuant to the plea agreement, the government would have recommended a sentence of only 168 months rather than the 222 months that the court imposed. Before the district court, Guadalupe made this assertion in his objection to the PSR and attached Spanish language notes from law enforcement interviews with these witnesses. We review the district court's decision to deny an evidentiary hearing at sentencing for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. McAndrews,</i> 12 F.3d 273, 279 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p>There may be circumstances in which a court should hear evidence regarding a prior conviction to determine whether the conduct underlying that conviction is part of the instant offense. However, under the circumstances present here, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to hear testimony from Diaz and Cuadrado. Guadalupe offered no evidence to indicate that these witnesses would testify that his prior convictions were part of the instant conspiracy.<sup>[4]</sup> His motion objecting to the PSR contained the bare allegation that these witnesses would testify that the conspiracy began before the 2001 date alleged in the indictment. At the sentencing hearing, Guadalupe's counsel argued that the \"indictment doesn't control the scope\" of the conspiracy and stated that Guadalupe would testify that he entered the conspiracy in February 1998. However, counsel did not even mention Cuadrado by name at the hearing, and mentioned Diaz only to state that she would testify that Guadalupe's 2002 marijuana conviction was part of the instant conspiracy.</p>\n<p>In short, there was no evidence to support counsel's bare allegations that testimony from Diaz and Cuadrado would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> reveal that Guadalupe's prior weapons convictions stemmed from conduct that was part of the instant conspiracy. Thus, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p>B. Juvenile Record</p>\n<p>Guadalupe also argues that the district court improperly relied on his confidential juvenile record in sentencing him without sufficiently disclosing the content of that record to him, in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. We review de novo a district court's compliance with Rule 32. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Baldrich,</i> 471 F.3d 1110, 1112 (9th Cir. 2006). If an error occurred, we will remand for resentencing if that error was not harmless. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Hamad,</i> 495 F.3d 241, 251 (6th Cir.2007) (applying harmless error review after finding a violation of Rule 32).</p>\n<p>A federal court may consider an offender's juvenile record in determining a sentence. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gonzalez-Arimont,</i> 268 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir.2001). The Sentencing Guidelines provide, inter alia, that the sentencing court should</p>\n<blockquote>(A) add 2 points . . . for each adult or juvenile sentence to confinement of at least sixty days if the defendant was released from such confinement within five years of his commencement of the instant offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) add 1 point . . . for each adult or juvenile sentence imposed within five years of the defendant's commencement of the instant offense not covered in (A).</blockquote>\n<p>U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(d)(2). Thus, it was proper for the district court to include Guadalupe's juvenile record in its criminal history calculation.</p>\n<p>Under the Puerto Rico Rules of Procedure for Minors' Matters, however, juvenile records must be sealed, and access to them is strictly limited. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 34, § 2237(d). Such confidential information, if used in federal sentencing, is subject to certain procedural requirements. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 states that a PSR \"must exclude . . . any sources of information obtained upon a promise of confidentiality.\" Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(d)(3). However, Rule 32 also states that at sentencing the court \"must give to the defendant and an attorney for the government a written summary of  or summarize in camera  any information excluded from the presentence report under Rule 32(d)(3) on which the court will rely in sentencing, and give them a reasonable opportunity to comment on that information.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>Regarding Guadalupe's juvenile conviction, the PSR stated, in full:</p>\n<blockquote>The Court has received information regarding this defendant's prior juvenile record under the promise of confidentiality and non-disclosure pursuant to a local court order. As such, complete disclosure of the subject information, which under [sections 4A1.2(d)(2)(B) and (a)(2) of the Sentencing Guidelines] affects the computation of his criminal history category is withheld.</blockquote>\n<p>Then, at the sentencing hearing, the district court stated that it \"has received information that is confidential about this defendant's prior criminal record. . . . This will also be considered.\" Guadalupe's counsel objected, stating: \"I am counsel and I should have that information available. . . . If you're going to consider it, we should have an opportunity to examine it or rebut it.\" The court responded: \"I don't think it would change anything, counsel. It says that  it was two counts of violation of the weapons law. So that's it. And this will go on the record. So I will consider that in my sentencing.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> On appeal, the government contends, as a preliminary matter, that Guadalupe did not preserve his challenge to the district court's reliance on the confidential information. It argues that, although defense counsel objected at sentencing to the district court's failure to disclose the details of Guadalupe's juvenile record to her, she did not object to the one point that was assessed for Guadalupe's juvenile record, either in his objection to the PSR or at sentencing. We need not resolve this issue, however, because even if the challenge was properly preserved, the court's error in not disclosing the content of Guadalupe's juvenile record was harmless.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has explained that the purpose of Rule 32 is to ensure \"focused, adversarial development of the factual and legal issues relevant to determining the appropriate Guidelines sentence.\" <i>Burns v. United States,</i> 501 U.S. 129, 134, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991). It is essential to this adversarial process that the court provide the defendant with all information related to his sentence on which the court intends to rely so that the defendant has adequate opportunity to contest any inaccuracies or present other relevant factors. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Baldrich,</i> 471 F.3d at 1114 (explaining that Rule 32 requires that \"all facts relevant to the defendant's sentence be provided to the defendant for adversarial testing\"); <i>United States v. Pabon-Cruz,</i> 321 F.Supp.2d 570, 573 (S.D.N.Y.2003)(\"[T]he process of disclosure, comment, and judicial ruling provided by Rules 32(e)-(i) is more than adequate to address any inaccuracy in the PSR. . . . Rule 32 specifically requires the Court to disclose to the defendant any information that the Court will rely on that is not in the PSR. . . .\"). Given this underlying policy rationale, the initial question in determining compliance with Rule 32 is whether the court has provided the defendant with enough information to allow the defendant to have a \"reasonable opportunity to comment\" on that information. Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(i)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>Ensuring a \"reasonable opportunity to comment\" requires the court to give more information to defense counsel than the cursory statement the district court provided here, which merely informed counsel that Guadalupe's juvenile record involved two counts of violations of the weapons laws. <i>See, e.g., Hamad,</i> at 250 (\"Because the summary did not refer to any specific incident or name its source(s), it did not give [the defendant] a `reasonable opportunity' to rebut the information or otherwise question its accuracy.\"). Puerto Rico law indicates that a defendant may have access to the confidential information on which the district court relied in this case, <i>see</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 34, § 2237(d), and federal law makes clear that the court should provide that information to the defendant, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(1)(B).<sup>[5]</sup> Moreover, given that the primary purpose of the Puerto Rico Rules of Procedure for Minors' Matters is to protect the privacy of juvenile offenders, there was no pragmatic reason for the court to withhold Guadalupe's records from him and his counsel. In light of these statutory provisions and the policy underlying them, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> district court erred in failing to give Guadalupe a summary of the information contained in his juvenile record.</p>\n<p>Despite this error, the court's partial disclosure, under the circumstances of this case, was harmless because Guadalupe still had a sufficient basis for disputing the violations. Guadalupe's submissions indicate that he in fact had substantial familiarity with his own criminal history. His reply brief acknowledges that he and his attorney \"were aware of his juvenile criminal record to some extent\" and that \"his actions as a juvenile were encompassed in the conspiracy for which he was found guilty.\" Guadalupe thus knew enough about his juvenile history to argue to the district court that this history should not be included as a separate offense in his sentencing. In light of this conceded knowledge, we see no reason to believe that the court's failure to offer a full explanation of Guadalupe's juvenile record impaired his ability to contest the court's reliance on that record in its sentencing. <i>See Hamad,</i> at 251. Thus, the district court's failure to disclose this information to Guadalupe was harmless.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to hold an evidentiary hearing for the testimony of cooperating government witnesses regarding the date of inception of the conspiracy. We further conclude that the deficiency in the information the court disclosed to Guadalupe and his counsel regarding his juvenile record was harmless error. Thus, we <i>affirm</i> Guadalupe's sentence.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Puerto Rico Rules of Procedure for Minors' Matters, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 34, § 2237(d), require that juvenile records be kept confidential subject to certain limited exceptions.</p>\n<p>[2]  The two points added for the marijuana conviction were removed, as well as the two points added under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(e) because the instant offense had occurred less than two years after Guadalupe was released after serving his term of imprisonment for the marijuana conviction. The changes left eight criminal history points, with a resulting criminal history category of IV.</p>\n<p>[3]  Guadalupe's plea agreement also contained a provision waiving his right to appeal. Although the government argued the waiver issue in its opening brief, it conceded at oral argument and confirmed in an \"Informative Motion\" submitted the following day that the waiver of appeal language in the plea agreement did not conform to the understanding of the parties. For that reason, the government withdrew its waiver of appeal argument.</p>\n<p>[4]  As noted, the law enforcement interview notes that Guadalupe attached to his objection to the PSR were in Spanish and were unaccompanied by English translations. Federal litigation in Puerto Rico must be conducted in English, 48 U.S.C. § 864, and, \"[w]hen a district court accepts foreign-language documents without the required English translations, an appellate court cannot consider the untranslated documents on appeal.\" <i>Davila v. Corporacion De P.R. Para La Difusion Publica,</i> 498 F.3d 9, 12-13, 2007 WL 2253531, at *2 (1st Cir. Aug.7, 2007); Fed. R.App. P. 10. Thus, even though the government submitted translations of the notes on appeal, we cannot consider them. Guadalupe offers no explanation for his omission of translations before the district court.</p>\n<p>[5]  The government's argument that Guadalupe's counsel should have obtained the juvenile records herself is unavailing. The Rules of Procedure for Minors' Matters do provide that juvenile records \"will be accessible for inspection by the minor's legal counsel after being duly identified and in the place designated for it.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 34, § 2237(d). However, Rule 32 requires that the court provide the defendant with a written summary of the confidential information before it, and there is no exception to this requirement simply because the defendant may have alternative avenues of obtaining the confidential information.</p>\n<p>[6]  The government also argues that any error was harmless because even if Guadalupe's juvenile conviction was removed from the criminal history calculation, he would still have seven criminal history points, which would still result in a criminal history category of IV. Thus, there would be no difference in the applicable sentencing range. However, having resolved the harmless error question on other grounds, we need not address this alternate rationale.</p>\n\n</div>",

However, the court stated that \"I don't think it would change anything,\" and included the juvenile history in its sentencing calculation. Finally, Guadalupe contended that the 2002 marijuana conviction was part of the instant conspiracy. The court accepted that contention.</p>\n<p>With the marijuana conviction excluded, Guadalupe's criminal history category was reduced to IV,<sup>[2]</sup> yielding a Sentencing Guidelines range of 210 to 262 months' imprisonment. The court then sentenced Guadalupe to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 222 months on each count. Guadalupe appeals, contending that (1) the district court abused its discretion in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing for the testimony of the government witnesses; and (2) the district court erred in considering confidential information from his juvenile record without disclosure of that information to him and his counsel.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>A. Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n<p>The Sentencing Guidelines instruct courts to determine an offender's criminal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> history category by adding a specified number of points \"for each prior sentence of imprisonment,\" U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1; the length of the prior sentence determines the number of points added. The Sentencing Guidelines further define a prior sentence as \"a sentence imposed prior to sentencing on the instant offense, <i>other than a sentence for conduct that is part of the instant offense.</i>\" U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2 cmt. n. 1 (emphasis added). In light of this provision, Guadalupe argues that the conduct leading to his 1998 and 1999 weapons convictions was part of the conduct comprising the instant conspiracy and should not have been included in his criminal history calculation.</p>\n<p>Guadalupe contends that the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing to consider the testimony of cooperating government witnesses Diaz and Cuadrado, who he claims would testify that his weapons violations in 1998 and 1999 were part of the instant conspiracy. The inclusion of the 1998 and 1999 weapons convictions made a substantial difference in the calculation of Guadalupe's criminal history. Without those two offenses, Guadalupe would have had only three criminal history points, rather than the eight that the district court included in its calculation. This would have resulted in a criminal history category of II, and pursuant to the plea agreement, the government would have recommended a sentence of only 168 months rather than the 222 months that the court imposed. Before the district court, Guadalupe made this assertion in his objection to the PSR and attached Spanish language notes from law enforcement interviews with these witnesses. We review the district court's decision to deny an evidentiary hearing at sentencing for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. McAndrews,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195084\"><a href=\"/opinion/195084/united-states-v-mcandrews/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span>, 279 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p>There may be circumstances in which a court should hear evidence regarding a prior conviction to determine whether the conduct underlying that conviction is part of the instant offense. However, under the circumstances present here, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to hear testimony from Diaz and Cuadrado. Guadalupe offered no evidence to indicate that these witnesses would testify that his prior convictions were part of the instant conspiracy.<sup>[4]</sup> His motion objecting to the PSR contained the bare allegation that these witnesses would testify that the conspiracy began before the 2001 date alleged in the indictment. At the sentencing hearing, Guadalupe's counsel argued that the \"indictment doesn't control the scope\" of the conspiracy and stated that Guadalupe would testify that he entered the conspiracy in February 1998. However, counsel did not even mention Cuadrado by name at the hearing, and mentioned Diaz only to state that she would testify that Guadalupe's 2002 marijuana conviction was part of the instant conspiracy.</p>\n<p>In short, there was no evidence to support counsel's bare allegations that testimony from Diaz and Cuadrado would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> reveal that Guadalupe's prior weapons convictions stemmed from conduct that was part of the instant conspiracy. Thus, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p>B. Juvenile Record</p>\n<p>Guadalupe also argues that the district court improperly relied on his confidential juvenile record in sentencing him without sufficiently disclosing the content of that record to him, in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. We review de novo a district court's compliance with Rule 32. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Baldrich,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796316\"><a href=\"/opinion/796316/united-states-v-mario-joseph-baldrich/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1110</span></a></span>, 1112 (9th Cir. 2006). If an error occurred, we will remand for resentencing if that error was not harmless. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Hamad,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1395118\"><a href=\"/opinion/1395118/united-states-v-hamad/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span>, 251 (6th Cir.2007) (applying harmless error review after finding a violation of Rule 32).</p>\n<p>A federal court may consider an offender's juvenile record in determining a sentence. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gonzalez-Arimont,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199628\"><a href=\"/opinion/199628/united-states-v-gonzalez-arimont/\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.2001). The Sentencing Guidelines provide, inter alia, that the sentencing court should</p>\n<blockquote>(A) add 2 points . . . for each adult or juvenile sentence to confinement of at least sixty days if the defendant was released from such confinement within five years of his commencement of the instant offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) add 1 point . . . for each adult or juvenile sentence imposed within five years of the defendant's commencement of the instant offense not covered in (A).</blockquote>\n<p>U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(d)(2). Thus, it was proper for the district court to include Guadalupe's juvenile record in its criminal history calculation.</p>\n<p>Under the Puerto Rico Rules of Procedure for Minors' Matters, however, juvenile records must be sealed, and access to them is strictly limited. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 34, § 2237(d). Such confidential information, if used in federal sentencing, is subject to certain procedural requirements. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 states that a PSR \"must exclude . . . any sources of information obtained upon a promise of confidentiality.\" Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(d)(3). However, Rule 32 also states that at sentencing the court \"must give to the defendant and an attorney for the government a written summary of  or summarize in camera  any information excluded from the presentence report under Rule 32(d)(3) on which the court will rely in sentencing, and give them a reasonable opportunity to comment on that information.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>Regarding Guadalupe's juvenile conviction, the PSR stated, in full:</p>\n<blockquote>The Court has received information regarding this defendant's prior juvenile record under the promise of confidentiality and non-disclosure pursuant to a local court order. As such, complete disclosure of the subject information, which under [sections 4A1.2(d)(2)(B) and (a)(2) of the Sentencing Guidelines] affects the computation of his criminal history category is withheld.</blockquote>\n<p>Then, at the sentencing hearing, the district court stated that it \"has received information that is confidential about this defendant's prior criminal record. . . . This will also be considered.\" Guadalupe's counsel objected, stating: \"I am counsel and I should have that information available. . . . If you're going to consider it, we should have an opportunity to examine it or rebut it.\" The court responded: \"I don't think it would change anything, counsel. It says that  it was two counts of violation of the weapons law. So that's it. And this will go on the record. So I will consider that in my sentencing.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> On appeal, the government contends, as a preliminary matter, that Guadalupe did not preserve his challenge to the district court's reliance on the confidential information. It argues that, although defense counsel objected at sentencing to the district court's failure to disclose the details of Guadalupe's juvenile record to her, she did not object to the one point that was assessed for Guadalupe's juvenile record, either in his objection to the PSR or at sentencing. We need not resolve this issue, however, because even if the challenge was properly preserved, the court's error in not disclosing the content of Guadalupe's juvenile record was harmless.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has explained that the purpose of Rule 32 is to ensure \"focused, adversarial development of the factual and legal issues relevant to determining the appropriate Guidelines sentence.\" <i>Burns v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112620\"><a href=\"/opinion/112620/burns-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 134, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112620\"><a href=\"/opinion/112620/burns-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2182</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112620\"><a href=\"/opinion/112620/burns-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span> (1991). It is essential to this adversarial process that the court provide the defendant with all information related to his sentence on which the court intends to rely so that the defendant has adequate opportunity to contest any inaccuracies or present other relevant factors. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Baldrich,</i> 471 F.3d at 1114 (explaining that Rule 32 requires that \"all facts relevant to the defendant's sentence be provided to the defendant for adversarial testing\"); <i>United States v. Pabon-Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2411261\"><a href=\"/opinion/2411261/united-states-v-pabon-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span>, 573 (S.D.N.Y.2003)(\"[T]he process of disclosure, comment, and judicial ruling provided by Rules 32(e)-(i) is more than adequate to address any inaccuracy in the PSR. . . . Rule 32 specifically requires the Court to disclose to the defendant any information that the Court will rely on that is not in the PSR. . . .\"). Given this underlying policy rationale, the initial question in determining compliance with Rule 32 is whether the court has provided the defendant with enough information to allow the defendant to have a \"reasonable opportunity to comment\" on that information. Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(i)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>Ensuring a \"reasonable opportunity to comment\" requires the court to give more information to defense counsel than the cursory statement the district court provided here, which merely informed counsel that Guadalupe's juvenile record involved two counts of violations of the weapons laws. <i>See, e.g., Hamad,</i> at 250 (\"Because the summary did not refer to any specific incident or name its source(s), it did not give [the defendant] a `reasonable opportunity' to rebut the information or otherwise question its accuracy.\"). Puerto Rico law indicates that a defendant may have access to the confidential information on which the district court relied in this case, <i>see</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 34, § 2237(d), and federal law makes clear that the court should provide that information to the defendant, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(1)(B).<sup>[5]</sup> Moreover, given that the primary purpose of the Puerto Rico Rules of Procedure for Minors' Matters is to protect the privacy of juvenile offenders, there was no pragmatic reason for the court to withhold Guadalupe's records from him and his counsel. In light of these statutory provisions and the policy underlying them, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> district court erred in failing to give Guadalupe a summary of the information contained in his juvenile record.</p>\n<p>Despite this error, the court's partial disclosure, under the circumstances of this case, was harmless because Guadalupe still had a sufficient basis for disputing the violations. Guadalupe's submissions indicate that he in fact had substantial familiarity with his own criminal history. His reply brief acknowledges that he and his attorney \"were aware of his juvenile criminal record to some extent\" and that \"his actions as a juvenile were encompassed in the conspiracy for which he was found guilty.\" Guadalupe thus knew enough about his juvenile history to argue to the district court that this history should not be included as a separate offense in his sentencing. In light of this conceded knowledge, we see no reason to believe that the court's failure to offer a full explanation of Guadalupe's juvenile record impaired his ability to contest the court's reliance on that record in its sentencing. <i>See Hamad,</i> at 251. Thus, the district court's failure to disclose this information to Guadalupe was harmless.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to hold an evidentiary hearing for the testimony of cooperating government witnesses regarding the date of inception of the conspiracy. We further conclude that the deficiency in the information the court disclosed to Guadalupe and his counsel regarding his juvenile record was harmless error. Thus, we <i>affirm</i> Guadalupe's sentence.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Puerto Rico Rules of Procedure for Minors' Matters, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 34, § 2237(d), require that juvenile records be kept confidential subject to certain limited exceptions.</p>\n<p>[2]  The two points added for the marijuana conviction were removed, as well as the two points added under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(e) because the instant offense had occurred less than two years after Guadalupe was released after serving his term of imprisonment for the marijuana conviction. The changes left eight criminal history points, with a resulting criminal history category of IV.</p>\n<p>[3]  Guadalupe's plea agreement also contained a provision waiving his right to appeal. Although the government argued the waiver issue in its opening brief, it conceded at oral argument and confirmed in an \"Informative Motion\" submitted the following day that the waiver of appeal language in the plea agreement did not conform to the understanding of the parties. For that reason, the government withdrew its waiver of appeal argument.</p>\n<p>[4]  As noted, the law enforcement interview notes that Guadalupe attached to his objection to the PSR were in Spanish and were unaccompanied by English translations. Federal litigation in Puerto Rico must be conducted in English, 48 U.S.C. § 864, and, \"[w]hen a district court accepts foreign-language documents without the required English translations, an appellate court cannot consider the untranslated documents on appeal.\" <i>Davila v. Corporacion De P.R. Para La Difusion Publica,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202880\"><a href=\"/opinion/202880/davila-v-corporacion-de-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 12-13, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2253531</span></span>, at *2 (1st Cir. Aug.7, 2007); Fed. R.App. P. 10. Thus, even though the government submitted translations of the notes on appeal, we cannot consider them. Guadalupe offers no explanation for his omission of translations before the district court.</p>\n<p>[5]  The government's argument that Guadalupe's counsel should have obtained the juvenile records herself is unavailing. The Rules of Procedure for Minors' Matters do provide that juvenile records \"will be accessible for inspection by the minor's legal counsel after being duly identified and in the place designated for it.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 34, § 2237(d). However, Rule 32 requires that the court provide the defendant with a written summary of the confidential information before it, and there is no exception to this requirement simply because the defendant may have alternative avenues of obtaining the confidential information.</p>\n<p>[6]  The government also argues that any error was harmless because even if Guadalupe's juvenile conviction was removed from the criminal history calculation, he would still have seven criminal history points, which would still result in a criminal history category of IV. Thus, there would be no difference in the applicable sentencing range. However, having resolved the harmless error question on other grounds, we need not address this alternate rationale.</p>\n\n</div>",
